BACKGROUND
lignocellulose constitutes an abundant organic material that is recalcitrant to degradation. across different plant species, it contains cellulose  and hemicellulose  moieties that are complexed with lignin  <cit> . the cellulose moiety is a glucose polymer, whereas the hemicellulose part is composed of various pentose and hexose sugars  linked by beta/alpha-glycosidic bonds . all of these sugars have great value for the production of bioethanol, biodiesel and/or plastics  <cit> , and so there have been many efforts to release them from the plant matrix. however, current physicochemical methodologies for the degradation of plant biomass and subsequent production of sugars are imperfect  <cit>  and so there is a great interest in the development of alternative and efficient processes, based on enzymes and/or lignocellulolytic microbes  <cit> .

the conversion of plant biomass to sugars requires the concerted action of different proteins, such as carbohydrate-binding modules , polysaccharide monooxygenases, pectin lyases, hemicellulases, endoglucanases and beta-glucosidases . among the hemicellulases, xylosidases that can work efficiently at high temperatures in alkaline conditions are highly valued with respect to their usefulness in the pulp bleaching process  <cit> . actually, hemicellulases, which have previously been regarded as “accessory enzymes” of cellulases, may themselves exert vital roles in plant biomass hydrolysis  <cit> . given the complexity of the enzymes required for efficient lignocellulose breakdown, multi-species microbial consortia offer interesting perspectives . to unlock the biocatalytic potential present in lignocellulolytic microbial consortia, metagenomics-based approaches have been proposed . two different strategies can be used: i) the unleashing of high-throughput dna sequencing on degradative consortia, and/or ii) the selection of enzymes via functional/genetic screening of metagenomic libraries produced from these consortia  <cit> .

functional metagenomic screening includes the detection of “positive clones” on the basis of phenotype , heterologous complementation and modulated detection by reporter genes  <cit> . as such, the approach does not depend on the availability of prior sequence information to detect enzymes and it therefore offers great potential to discover genetic novelty. using this approach, searches for cellulases have already been made in microbiomes from decaying wood, compost, rumen and soil . however, only few studies have explored the enzymatic potential of microbial enrichments  <cit> . it is important to notice that functional screenings come with a possible caveat, which relates to the fact that the expression conditions in the heterologous host used need to match the requirements of the insert. due to this and other caveats , the frequency with which positive clones are uncovered may be very low  <cit> . in attempts to overcome such low hit rates, some studies have applied “biased”  samples, coupled to the use of highly sensitive chromogenic substrates   <cit> . other studies have used plasmid vectors with dual-orientation promoters to obtain more positive clones  <cit> . the commonly-used substrates for screening for cellulose-degrading enzymes include azo-dyed and azurine cross-linked polysaccharides , para-nitrophenyl glycosides , carboxymethylcellulose and rimazol brilliant blue dyed-xylan. however, multiple chromogenic substrates as proxies for functional screening for cellulases have been underexplored, although, recently, these types of approaches were catalogued as highly interesting  <cit> .

in this study, phylogenetically stable wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia  served as the sources for two fosmid-based metagenomic libraries. these libraries were subjected to expanded functional screens by a multi-substrate approach using six chromogenic compounds . sequencing of the inserts of seven selected positive clones indicated the presence of a suite of novel genes encoding proteins of distinct glycosyl hydrolase  families, which were flanked mostly by cbms and abc transporters. thus, we present an effective strategy for exploration of fosmid libraries for cellulases, revealing hit rates higher than those reported in previous studies. subsequent functional analyses unveiled genes encoding putative novel thermo-alkaline-tolerant enzymes, which opens the way for future biotechnological applications .

RESULTS
construction and functional screening of two fosmid metagenomic libraries
two metagenomic libraries were produced in fosmids, one from pooled raw wheat straw  consortial dna  and another one from torrified wheat straw . each library contained clones with inserts of ~35 kb average size, yielding approximately  <dig>  gb of total cloned genomic dna per library. in order to screen for cellulose-degrading enzymes, about  <dig>  clones per library were subjected to activity screens on lb agar supplemented with mixtures of six chromogenic substrates . these screens yielded a total of  <dig> positive hits, being  <dig> from rws and  <dig> from tws. this corresponded to, respectively,  <dig> hit per  <dig> screened clones , and  <dig> hit per  <dig>  screened clones .table  <dig> chromogenic substrates used in this study

the  <dig> positive fosmid clones were restreaked to purity and then retested for activity to confirm the initial screening results. they were then subjected to additional plate screens with the hemicellulose-mimicking substrates x-fuc, x-gal, x-xyl and x-man, including single-, double- and mixed-substrate plates. the  <dig> positive clones showed activity in the latter assay , confirming the initial data. clones that showed consistent activities on the mixtures of six substrates but no activity on the aforementioned hemicellulose-mimicking substrates were then tested for their abilities to degrade cellulose or starch using x-cel and x-glu  . after removal of clones with questionable activity , the remaining  <dig> clones showed consistent activities on at least one of the substrates tested. specifically,  <dig> clones showed activity on x-gal ,  <dig> on x-xyl  and  <dig> on x-glu  . remarkably, eight were positive only on the mixture of six substrates.

for each fosmid clone type in our library, as determined by activity, 2– <dig> clones were selected for genetic analysis. this selection was also guided by the clones' origin, i.e. rws or tws. restriction with ecor <dig> revealed, for all tested fosmids, the presence of insert sizes of approximately  <dig> to 35 kb. it also allowed the detection of duplicates, for dereplication of the fosmid set. the, thus selected, final set of  fosmids consisted of two clones that were positive for x-gal , one for x-xyl , two for x-glu , and two with activity on multiple mixed substrates  .table  <dig> selected fosmids for insert sequencing and annotation of genes

the seven selected clones , were subjected to full insert sequencing. final assembly of the inserts revealed a total of  <dig> contigs, of sizes between  <dig>  and 35 kb. thus, some inserts had more than one contig, indicating the existence of regions with too low coverage. per clone, the contigs were considered to be of sufficient representation to allow further analyses . all contigs were then screened for the presence of open reading frames  on the basis of the presence of start and stop codons . in addition, the identified genes were, gene-by-gene, subjected to blast-based analyses, comparing against the ncbi and carbohydrate-active enzyme  databases. overall, we detected  <dig> promising orfs encoding proteins from  <dig> different gh families amongst a total of  <dig> orfs. the g + c contents of the inserts ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. the complete annotation of each of the seven fosmid inserts is presented in the supplementary files. a brief description of each insert is listed below .fig.  <dig> graphical representation of the genes detected and annotated in seven fosmid inserts selected by the multi-substrate screening approach

fosmid nt2-2
two contigs represented the total  <dig>  kb insert, encompassing  <dig> predicted orfs. the sizes of the identified orfs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. gene annotation revealed the presence of two predicted genes encoding proteins of gh families gh <dig> and gh <dig>  the gh2-encoding gene was annotated as a beta-galactosidase  and could be correlated with the activity on x-gal. flanking this gene, genes predicted to encode two cbms , two glycosyl transferases   and an operon containing three methionine abc transporter genes were found .

fosmid t5-5
thirty predicted orfs, with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, were present in the  <dig>  kb insert . a gene predicted to encode a 789-amino acid protein  was annotated as a gene for beta-xylosidase. this protein could be involved in the detected enzymatic activity on x-xyl. flanking this gene, three abc transporters, a xyloside transporter  and a cbm <dig> gene  were found. in addition, predicted genes for carbohydrate-active enzymes of families cbm <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> were detected .

fosmid nt18-17
thirty-five orfs were identified in the  <dig>  kb insert . the insert showed a high g + c content, i.e.  <dig>  %. four gh-encoding genes were detected, which fell in the gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families. of these, two predicted proteins might be linked to the activity on x-glu . in addition, ten predicted abc transporter genes were detected .

fosmid t4-1
this contiguous insert  consisted of  <dig> orfs, of sizes between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp. two genes with predicted gh activity were found. these might be involved in the enzymatic activities detected on mixed substrates, i.e. a gh <dig> family gene  and a gh <dig> family one . in addition, three genes predicted to encode cbms were found in this insert . the remainder encompassed either hypothetical and/or uncharacterized genes  or genes encoding different functions  .

fosmid 10bt
fourty-three orfs were identified in the  <dig>  kb insert of fosmid 10bt . consistent with the annotation, genes predicted to encode two ghs , two auxiliary activities , one gt  and one abc transporter were identified. of these, the newly discovered gh <dig>  and gh <dig>  genes could be related to the activities measured with the mixture of substrates. interestingly, these genes were annotated -by rast- as a transcriptional regulator  and an inner membrane protein, yfin, respectively .

fosmid nt18-21
fosmid nt18- <dig> contained a  <dig>  kb insert within a single contig. although this insert contained a total of  <dig> predicted orfs, cazy annotation predicted only one gene with carbohydrate activity, i.e. one encoding cbm <dig> . furthermore, two operons were detected that might relate to the activity, one of them encompassing predicted genes for maltose/maltodextrin transporters and the second one presumed polysaccharide synthesis genes . the latter operon was flanked by a gene for glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and one for an aspartokinase, which are both involved in sugar metabolism .

fosmid t17-2
nineteen orfs were identified within the  <dig>  kb insert of fosmid t17- <dig> , which had a g + c content of  <dig>  %. the orfs had a size range between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp. one orf, encoding a  <dig> -amino acid protein, was identified as a gene for beta-galactosidase , suggesting it was responsible for the activity of the fosmid on x-gal. in addition, we identified genes for the transcriptional repressor of the lac operon and "pts system sucrose-specific iib component", that were identified by cazy as a gh <dig> and a gh <dig> family proteins, respectively. two genes encoding gts , and one gene for cbm <dig> were also identified .

tracking the microbial sources of the fosmid inserts
to identify the potential microbial source of each metagenomic insert, the predicted amino acid sequences per gene per contig were blast-compared to the ncbi database. in addition, such blast results were analyzed by the lowest common ancestor  algorithm in megan v <dig> . thus,  <dig> predicted protein sequences from the nt2- <dig> insert were affiliated to proteins of members of the enterobacteriaceae, notably klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter sp. however, another  <dig> predicted proteins from this insert were affiliated, based on the  <dig> “best” blast hits, to those from pseudomonas putida. in the fosmid t5- <dig> insert,  <dig> predicted proteins were mainly related to klebsiella oxytoca –derived proteins. the insert of fosmid nt18- <dig> showed a complexity of genes that were affiliated to different genera . these genera all belong to the rhizobiales, suggesting an organism from this group as the most likely source. in both fosmids t4- <dig> and nt18- <dig>  virtually all predicted proteins  were affiliated with proteins from members of the enterobacteriaceae. closer  screening of the data indicated that insert t4- <dig> might come from a klebsiella oxytoca -like organism, whereas insert nt18- <dig> might originate from an organism affiliated with either citrobacter, klebsiella or salmonella. a similar observation was made for the fosmid t17- <dig> insert. in the case of fosmid 10bt, eleven orfs yielded predicted proteins that resembled those of pseudomonas putida –like organisms , whereas the remainder of the predicted proteins were more related to those from enteric species . this was similar to what was shown for the nt2- <dig> insert.

functional analyses: beta-galactosidase, beta-xylanase and alpha-glucosidase activities
based on the initially-detected activities of the fosmid clones, we selected three commercially available substrates, i.e. para-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside , para-nitrophenyl-beta-d-xylanopyranoside  and para-nitrophenyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoside , in order to quantify the activities  at different temperatures and ph values. clones nt2- <dig> and t17- <dig> were positive on pnpgal, confirming the initial screening data, while clones t5- <dig>  t4- <dig> and 10bt were positive on pnpxyl. in addition, clone nt18- <dig> showed activity on pnpglu . clones nt2- <dig> and t5- <dig> showed elevated levels of enzymatic activity and were therefore chosen for further assays . total protein extracts produced from the fosmid-less host  did not show any activity on the selected pnp substrates, confirming that the activities came from the metagenomic inserts.fig.  <dig> functional analyses  based on total proteins extracted from selected positive fosmid clones. a characterization of the fosmid clones using three pnp-substrates . b and c effect of temperature and ph on the activity of clones nt2- <dig> and t17- <dig> with pnpgal. d and e effect of temperature and ph on the activity of clones t5- <dig>  t4- <dig> and 10bt with pnpxyl



for clone nt2- <dig>  activity on pnpgal was maximal at 55 °c and ph  <dig>  , with 34 % and 44 % of activity remaining at 80 °c and ph  <dig> , respectively. activity was not detected below ph  <dig>  . the activity of clone t5- <dig> on pnpxyl was maximal at 55 °c, with values of around  <dig>   <dig> and 12 % of this maximum at  <dig>   <dig> and 22 °c, respectively. the highest xylanolytic activity for clone t5- <dig> was obtained at 55 °c and ph  <dig>  , with ~91 % of activity remaining at ph  <dig> . the enzyme produced by t5- <dig> was likely alkaliphilic. similar to clone nt2- <dig>  t5- <dig> activity was not detected at ph values below  <dig>  . finally, clone nt18- <dig> showed maximum activity at ph  <dig>  and 55 °c , with about  <dig>  u/mg at 40 °c and ph  <dig> . this suggested this enzyme was quite tolerant to alkaline conditions .fig.  <dig> relative enzymatic activities of the total proteins produced from the fosmid clones nt2- <dig>  t5- <dig> and nt18- <dig> using pnpgal, pnpxyl and pnpglu, respectively, at different temperatures and ph values. a and b effect of temperatures and ph on the activity of fosmid clone nt2- <dig>  c and d effect of temperatures and ph values on the activity of the fosmid clone t5- <dig>  e and f effect of temperature and ph on the activity of fosmid clone nt18-17



zymograms
native polyacrylamide gels showed that crude protein extracts from the seven fosmid clones had band patterns different from those of the e. coli epi <dig> host. moreover, none of the bands produced from the e. coli epi <dig> host were positive with mufgal  and mufxyl  , confirming that any activities measured came from the metagenomic inserts. clones nt2- <dig> and t17- <dig> both showed a band of >100 kda with high activity on mufgal . given their estimated sizes, these bands likely represent proteins encoded by genes  <dig> and  <dig> . clone t4- <dig> showed a band of 75–100 kda size, with xylosidase activity, which is consistent with the initial finding of activity on pnpxyl. this band likely corresponds to a protein encoded by gene  <dig> , predicted to be a beta-xylosidase of ~86 kda. clones t5- <dig> and 10bt, positive with pnpxyl, did not show any bands with activity on the zymograms using mufxyl.fig.  <dig> native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and zymogram analysis. left: native polyacrylamide gel of the total proteins from the positive fosmid clones. right: positive fosmid clones that showed bands  with activity on the zymogram assay using mufgal  and mufxyl  as substrates



discussion
in this study, two wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia, rws and tws, were successfully subjected to metagenomic library constructions using fosmids, yielding  <dig>  gb of genomic information per library. taking an estimated average bacterial genome size in our microbial consortia of 4 mb and considering these were strongly dominated by bacteria, we thus cloned the equivalent of roughly  <dig> bacterial genomes. previous data on the two consortia  <cit>  revealed the presence of ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  dominant bacterial types, in relative abundances within one log unit, giving a coverage of around six-fold for rws and twelve-fold for tws. hence, a back-of-the-envelope calculation revealed that we basically covered the genes from most of the dominant bacterial members in the degrader consortia.

to detect cellulolytic enzymes by functional screenings, two alternative strategies can be followed: 1) high-throughput detection in agar plates  using hydrolysis of a chromogenic substrate as the criterion and 2) detection of enzyme activity in crude extracts after cell lysis. in either methodology, additional factors should be taken into account. these are the vector copy number, the need for induction of gene expression, secretion of the enzyme and recovery of the vector plasmid after expression  <cit> . here, we tested our fosmids by functional screenings for cellulases initially using a mixture of  chromogenic compounds in agar plates. these substrates  can be internalized by e. coli and are thus readily available for hydrolysis by intracellularly-expressed exo-glycosidases. this is not the case for substrates such as oat spelt xylan or cmc, the hydrolysis of which relies on the release of fosmid-expressed enzymes, which probably only occurs after cell death and lysis  <cit> . the substrates were organic compounds, each consisting of a monosaccharide linked to a substituted indole moiety. the substrates yield insoluble blue compounds as a result of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis. for example, x-xyl, when cleaved by beta-xylosidase, yields xylose and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-hydroxyindole. the latter compound can spontaneously dimerize and is oxidized into  <dig> ′-dibromo- <dig> ′-dichloro-indigo, an intensely blue product which is insoluble. taking into account the structure of these substrates, we hypothesized that the approach allows the screening for debranching enzymes that act in the external chains of sugars  and that are linked to the backbone of the cellulose structures. indeed, our multi-substrate approach is also applicable in screens of metagenomic libraries for other classes of enzymes, as long as chromogenic substrates are available for that purpose. for example, to detect lipolytic activity, 5--2-thioxothia-zolidin-4-one-3-ethanoic acid -propionate, sra-butyrate, sra-octanoate, sra-decanoate, sra-laurate and sra-myristate can be employed  <cit> .

given our high hit rates, i.e.1: <dig> in rws and 1: <dig>  in tws, the multi-substrate screening approach was superior to approaches reported in the recent literature . on the other hand, in both libraries the hit rates for the individual enzymes were <1: <dig> , except for x-gal in rws . comparing  <dig> different metagenomic libraries and  <dig> single substrates, we inferred an average hit rate of cellulolytic activities of ~ 1: <dig> . however, some approaches showed hit rates of < 1: <dig> . additionally, low hit rates were found  using chromogenic substrates  or azurine cross-linked polysaccharides. interestingly, zhao et al.  <cit> , screening a bac vector library produced from a cow rumen microbiome, reported a hit rate of 1: <dig> using xylan as the screening substrate. nguyen et al.  <cit> , screening their buffalo rumen metagenomic library, found hit rates of 1: <dig> and 1: <dig>  using azcl-he-cellulose and azcl-xylan, respectively. the authors suggested that the relatively high hit rate on azcl-he-cellulose can be attributed to the use of enzhance cell permeabilizing reagent. these results emphasize the advantages of combining large-insert libraries , enriched-function systems  and reagents that enhance the host cell permeabilities, allowing the release of enzymes.table  <dig> comparison of functional metagenomic approaches to screen for cellulases

here, “biased” communities were produced on wheat straw as the carbon source and energy, which is thought to raise the relative abundance of target genes in the consortium and thus in the fosmid clones. however, mori et al.  <cit> , using a puc <dig> library produced from pulp enrichments, obtained a hit rate of only 1: <dig>  with rimazol brilliant blue dyed-xylan. beloqui et al.  <cit>  reported a hit rate of 1: <dig>  in a library prepared from filter paper -enrichments inoculated from earthworm gut extract, using as the screening substrate pnp-beta-d-glucopyranoside. another interesting approach that potentially leads to highly efficient discovery of gh activities is the construction of metagenomic libraries prepared from dna selected following stable isotope probing  using multiple labeled plant-derived carbon substrates. for example, verastegui et al.  <cit>  showed a hit rate of 1: <dig> using dna from 13c-cellulose-enriched incubations on the basis of cmc as the substrate . clearly, the rates of obtaining positive clones are related to the cloning vector used, the metagenome source, the screening technique  and the host cells. on top of that, in many cases stochastic  factors play a role as well, which may relate to the relatively low sample sizes  <cit> .

in functional screening of metagenomic libraries, proper selection of the substrate is highly recommended. initial selection of substrate-active clones with “general” substrates or mixtures of substrates followed by more specific ones may represent a desirable “layered” approach. recently, a new generation of multi-colored chromogenic polysaccharide substrates has been developed  <cit> . these substrates can be used to screen for gh activities . they show versatility and are convenient for high-throughput analyses for first-level screenings. additionally, substrates representing -at least partially- the complexity of plant cell walls were produced, enabling activity screens on “real-world” plant polysaccharides.

in our study, four fosmid inserts carried genes that could be directly linked to the enzymatic activities based on homologies to known enzymes and predicted and detected protein sizes. thus, proteins of predicted sizes  from fosmids nt2- <dig> and t17- <dig>  did transform pnpgal and mufgal . these were both annotated as beta-galactosidases of family gh <dig>  . fosmids t5- <dig> and t4- <dig>  positive on x-xyl/pnpxyl and mixed chromogenic substrates, respectively, revealed the presence of genes predicted to produce proteins of  <dig> amino acids , which were annotated as beta-xylosidases of family gh <dig> . interesting, fosmid t4- <dig> showed activity only on the substrate mixes, but not on single x-xyl. this clone showed slight activity on pnpxyl  and revealed a protein of size between  <dig> to 100 kda, which was likely encoded by gene  <dig> . the protein was positive on the zymogram using mufxyl as a substrate . the expression of this gh <dig> family gene may be regulated by the presence of the other substrates. based on this rationale, on x-xyl alone its activity might not be detected, whereas the presence of other substrates might spur activity, similar to what may happen in nature. such a finding opens up a new paradigm in the screening of active enzymes from metagenomic libraries. interestingly, in fosmid t4- <dig> a predicted xyloside transporter gene  was detected, which matched the cazy gh <dig> family. proteins from this family can have glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase activity, suggesting a possible involvement in activity on mixed substrates.

although fosmid nt18- <dig> was positive on x-glu and pnpglu, we did not detect any gene related with its predicted alpha-glucosidase activity. however, the detected genes for family gh <dig>  and family gh <dig>  proteins might encode the activity . similarly, fosmid nt18- <dig> showed alpha-glucosidase activity, with no gh family genes being detected in the insert. in this fosmid, genes for maltose/maltodextrin transporters were found. maltose  resembles a cellulose dimer . maltose is released from starch by amylose/amylopectin-degrading activity . we surmised that starch that was initially present in the wheat straw used for consortium breeding incited the selection of such systems. the chromogenic substrates, e.g. x-glu, used in this study were surmised to report alpha-glucosidase activities, but genes for such enzymes were not detected. possibly, gene  <dig>  or gene  <dig>  were responsible for the activity .

fosmid clone 10bt showed consistent activity only on mixed substrates. in addition, 10bt showed activity on pnpxyl, much below that shown by clone t5- <dig> . the finding of two genes producing proteins related to gh <dig> and gh <dig> families was revealing. interestingly, family gh <dig> proteins have been linked to beta-xylosidase and alpha-l-iduronidase activities. moreover, gh <dig> family proteins can have beta- <dig> -galactanase activity . the latter is possibly linked to the degradation of galactans and arabinogalactans, both integral parts of the pectin component of plant cell walls  <cit> . interestingly, jiménez et al.  <cit>  recently found a novel cold-tolerant esterase, which had originally been annotated as a marr family transcriptional regulator. thus, we surmised that the gene that was originally predicted to encode an arac transcriptional regulator may be responsible for the activity on pnpxyl. similar to clone t4- <dig>  this clone could require the presence of other types of substrates to enable detection of its full plethora of activities. however, given that we still don’t know the mechanism involved, further studies are required, for example subcloning, transposon mutagenesis and detection of activities on different substrates.

the high activity of fosmid nt2- <dig> compared to that of clones t5- <dig> and nt18- <dig> suggested a raised expression of the gene encoding beta-galactosidase . interestingly, the high activities of clones nt2- <dig> and t5- <dig> at 55 °c and ph  <dig>  pointed to their potential usefulness in pulp bleaching processes. the novelty attributed to these genes  was based on the low amino acid identities  and coverage values  versus the best hits in the ncbi database . the functional analysis done by us directly from the metagenomic clones indicated substrate specificities and temperature/ph optima, and constitutes an easy way to select clones useful for biotechnology applications. in addition, subcloning, overexpression, induction and subsequent protein purification are labor-intensive and not always successful .

the leading industrial source of cellulase cocktails used for plant biomass biodegradation purposes is trichoderma reesei. several strains exist and their secretomes have been widely used to develop new commercial cocktails. however, t. reesei secretomes are dominated by endoglucanases and it usually produces low quantities of xylanases, arabinofuranosidases, galactosidases and beta-glucosidases. hence, addition of exogenous enzymes to the secreted fraction could improve the hydrolytic efficiency  <cit> . based on this premise, the enzymes detected in clones nt2- <dig>  t5- <dig> and nt18- <dig> might serve as components of new cellulolytic cocktails. these may be combined with the commercial cellulases to improve plant biomass degradation for second-generation biofuel production. additionally, thermo-alkaliphilic xylosidases are valuable with respect to their usefulness in pulp bleaching processes  <cit> .

in a previous study  <cit> , bacteroidetes-related genes for hemicellulases were found to be prominent amongst the dominant enzymes, whereas klebsiella-related ones were less abundant. both groups of organisms are key dominant types in our bacterial consortia bred on wheat straw. in the current study, evidence was found for the contention that klebsiella-related organisms were at the basis of most cloned genes for biodegradative enzymes. the taxonomic closeness between this putative source organism  and the heterologous host  used, versus the remoteness in the case of bacteroidetes, may have been a key factor explaining this finding. unfortunately, the current study did not detect fosmids with activities on x-fuc and x-man. such activities might be mostly associated with members of the bacteroidetes , as recently indicated by jiménez et al.  <cit> . finally, the differential association of fosmid nt2- <dig> and 10bt genes with pseudomonas putida versus klebsiella sp. was remarkable. is-elements indicative of horizontal gene transfer were not detected, suggesting these fosmids might originate from fusions of two regions originating from different parental organisms. alternatively, the insert may have come from a new gammaproteobacteria species.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we propose a multi-substrate screening approach as a sound strategy that allows to detect multiple activities in a single initial assay. this methodology is less time-consuming than single-substrate approaches and can even be applied in high-throughput set-ups, as in agar plates. the strategy yielded high hit rates of genes for relevant enzymes compared with recent relevant literature data. based on this methodology, we retrieved fosmids with beta-galactosidase, beta-xylosidase and alpha-glucosidase activities, whereas other fosmids showed activity only in the presence of mixed chromogenic substrates. two fosmids, nt2- <dig>  and t5- <dig> , showed enzymatic activities at high temperatures and ph values, making these clones interesting sources for future biotechnological applications.
