BACKGROUND
cggbp <dig> was identified as a cgg triplet repeat binding protein in vitro  <cit> . ever since, different studies have focused on its ability to bind to cgg triplet repeats and exert transcriptional repression. previously, we found that cggbp <dig> participates in heat shock stress response by regulating hsf <dig> expression through heat-sensitive interactions with nfix and hmgn <dig>  <cit> . in normal human fibroblasts, which are expected to have all the checkpoints and dna repair capabilities intact, we recently reported functions of cggbp <dig> in cell cycle regulation at the abscission and consequential prevention of tetraploidy  <cit> . in cancer cells however, which often have various abnormalities in the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms, function of cggbp <dig> is unknown and is of obvious interest since loss of cell cycle regulation is an event central to tumorigenesis.

cell proliferation is tightly regulated by different mechanisms, which can halt it at an appropriate stage of cell cycle in response to abnormalities in extracellular as well as intracellular environment. physical or chemical stress to the cells, inability to respond to mitogenic signals, trans-mitotic inheritance of polyploidy, dna damage response or loss of function of critical cell cycle regulatory genes  <cit>  exemplify some such conditions that can cause a cell cycle block. the kind of effects these conditions can have on the cell cycle progression could however vary from one cell type to the other depending on their genetic and epigenetic profiles.

under normal conditions, cell cycle arrest in the g0/g <dig> phase is associated with the phenomena of quiescence, when cells do not receive enough mitogenic stimulation in terms of growth factors, and senescence, when cells are terminally differentiated and enter a post-mitotic state  <cit> . altered expression of critical genes, due to genetic and epigenetic disturbances, can also cause cell cycle disturbances  <cit> . the ability of cells to undergo cell cycle arrest is paramount to the health of any multicellular organism and a complex network of proteins has evolved to execute it. the progression of cell cycle from g <dig> to s phase is regulated by a well-studied series of events. the cyclin dependent kinases cdk <dig> and cdk <dig> must interact with cyclin d to become active and phosphorylate rb  <cit> . this phosphorylation of rb releases it from the transcriptional inhibitory complex with e2f, which then drives the expression of many genes including cyclin e. cyclin e complexes with cdk <dig> to drive entry into s phase. the very first step of this cascade, interactions between cdk4/ <dig> and cyclin d is inhibited by ink4a and arf, as they compete with cyclin d for binding to cdk4/ <dig>  <cit> . another protein, cdkn1a is a multifaceted regulator of the cell cycle. it inhibits cyclin e-cdk <dig> as well as cyclin d-cdk <dig> interactions and can arrest cell cycle at g <dig> or early s phase in response to dna damage  <cit> . furthermore, cdkn1a expression is controlled by tp <dig>  a strong tumor suppressor gene activated by dna damage response, which frequently exhibiting loss of function in many cancers. the mutations in some or many of these cell cycle regulatory genes such as tp <dig>  cdkn1a, ink4a and arf often underlie the aberrant control of cell cycle and the ability of cancer cells to escape the cell cycle block at g0/g <dig> phase in response to the stimuli, which would normally cause a g0/g <dig> arrest. the growth arrest specific gene gas <dig> is known to cause g0/g <dig> arrest in normal as well as transformed cells  <cit>  and the mechanisms of the regulation of its levels are less well understood.

in this study, we combined cggbp <dig> knockdown by sirna with different genetic mutations of various cell cycle regulatory genes to rigorously test how cggbp <dig> regulates cell cycle in cancer cells. for this we have used well-established human cancer cell lines and also generated new murine glioblastoma cell lines. we report that in all the cell lines examined, cggbp <dig> deficiency produced a cell cycle block at g0/g <dig> phase. expression analysis of candidate genes showed that cggbp <dig> regulates expression of cdkn1a and gas <dig> genes. mutation of cdkn1a and sirna-mediated depletion of gas <dig> could not rescue the cggbp <dig> deficiency-induced cell cycle block at g0/g <dig> phase, suggesting that cggbp <dig> controls cell cycle progression through the g <dig> phase through multiple parallel mechanisms. our results show new functions for cggbp <dig> in cell cycle, in regulation of expression of cdkn1a and gas <dig>  and provide insights into how cggbp <dig> depletion overrides the redundancies of checkpoint escape mechanisms present in different cancer cells.

RESULTS
cggbp <dig> depletion by sirna increases g0/g <dig> phase and reduces s phase cell populations
we have previously established a protocol of sirna-mediated knockdown of cggbp <dig> at both mrna and protein levels  <cit> . in this study, we used the same protocol of sirna mediated knockdown of cggbp <dig>  as described earlier  <cit> , to deplete cggbp <dig> in the human glioma cell line u- <dig> mg. knockdown by sirna was efficient as immunofluorescence showed a strong reduction in protein levels  <dig> h after transfection as compared to control sirna transfected cells . the cells were transfected at 50% confluence and after  <dig> h, while control sirna transfected cultures grew to confluence, cggbp <dig> sirna transfected cultures did not show increase in cell density with no visible difference in the proportion of dead cells, suggesting that the cggbp <dig> transfected cells underwent a cell cycle arrest. expression of the proliferation marker ki <dig> was also reduced in the cggbp <dig> sirna transfected cells . flow cytometric measurement of dna content per nucleus showed that in the cggbp <dig> depleted cultures the g0/g <dig> population was increased while the population of s phase was strongly decreased . the depletion of cggbp <dig> by using the previously described utr sirna against cggbp <dig>  <cit>  also generated a similar cell cycle arrest in g1/g <dig> phase with a concomitant decrease in the s phase in u- <dig> mg cells stably transfected with an empty expression vector . however, in u- <dig> mg cells stably expressing cggbp <dig> from a utr-devoid transcript, the utr sirna failed to produce the g0/g <dig> arrest , showing the specificity of sirna response. these results showed that in the u- <dig> mg cells, cggbp <dig> is required for normal cell cycle progression and its depletion results in a cell cycle arrest characterized by an accumulation of cells in the g0/g <dig> phase and a parallel reduction in the s-phase population.

n =  <dig> independent transfections in each case. the differences between the g1/g <dig> phase and s phase values for control sirna and cggbp <dig> sirna  are significant . difference between control sirna and utr sirna is significant for u- <dig> mg-vector but insignificant for u- <dig> mg-cggbp <dig> . please note that close to 50% reductions in the s phase populations of most samples due to cggbp <dig> knockdown is reflected as a rather minor yet significant increase in the g0/g <dig> phase populations.

cggbp <dig> deficiency increases the expression of some key cell cycle regulatory genes
to identify the mechanisms through which cggbp <dig> depletion might cause the cell cycle arrest at g0/g <dig> phase, we focused on the function of cggbp <dig> as a transcription-regulatory protein. we tested the possibility if cggbp <dig> could regulate expression of key genes coding for proteins involved in cell cycle control at the g0/g <dig> phase. u- <dig> mg cells were transfected with control or cggbp <dig> sirna and relative changes in mrna levels of a panel of candidate genes including cdkn1a and gas <dig> were assayed by quantitative real time rt-pcr . the mrna levels of these genes were significantly increased upon cggbp <dig> sirna treatment in assays performed on cdna samples from three independent transfections. western blot analysis showed that cdkn1a and gas <dig> protein levels were increased upon cggbp <dig> depletion .

cggbp <dig> is known to regulate transcription by directly binding to cgg tandem repeats or through its association with other transcription regulatory proteins such as nfix and hmgn <dig>  <cit> . of all the cggbp <dig> target genes analyzed, cdkn1a had the strongest increase in expression . although cdkn1a promoter  <cit>  is cpg rich, it does not contain cgg repeats. however, it contains nfi-binding site and is regulated by nfi proteins including nfix  <cit> . however, an in silico analysis of promoter sequences  showed the genomic region harboring the gas <dig> gene contains many small interrupted cgg repeats along the entire length of the gene, which contains only one exon and no introns.

since the increased expression of cdkn1a and gas <dig> could be associated with cell cycle arrest in g0/g <dig>  we wanted to understand the mechanisms through which cggbp <dig> might regulate expression of cdkn1a and gas <dig>  to this end, we assayed how cggbp <dig> depletion affects the transcription regulatory chromatin profiles at gas <dig> and cdkn1a promoters.

cggbp <dig> binds to and affects chromatin profiles at the cdkn1a and gas <dig> promoters
chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays showed that cggbp <dig> was associated with the cdkn1a promoter . histone h3k <dig> trimethylation, a transcription repressive histone modification, was reduced at the cdkn1a promoter in cggbp <dig> depleted samples compared to the control sirna . chip-quantitative pcrs  showed that cggbp <dig> depletion did not affect the level of histone h3k <dig> acetylation at the cdkn1a promoter .

chip assays for cggbp <dig> binding to the flanking regions of the gc-rich gas <dig> gene showed that cggbp <dig> was recruited to this locus . h3k <dig> trimethylation was significantly reduced by cggbp <dig> depletion . however cggbp <dig> depletion did not affect h3k <dig> acetylation in this region .

these results showed that cggbp <dig> maintains a specific h3k <dig> trimethylation code at the cdkn1a and gas <dig> promoters, which is disturbed after its depletion and is associated with their increased expression.

the g0/g <dig> arrest caused by cggbp <dig> sirna does not depend singly on tp <dig>  cdkn1a, ink4a, arf or gas <dig> expression
we then tested if the expression of the above mentioned cell cycle regulatory genes, is required for cggbp <dig> sirna-induced g0/g <dig> arrest. we performed cell cycle analyses in cells of different genetic backgrounds transfected with control or cggbp <dig> sirna. for all the batches of sirna transfections, cggbp <dig> knockdown was confirmed by real time qrt-pcr .

first, we asked if the increased level of cdkn1a is the key event underlying the cggbp <dig> sirna-induced g0/g <dig> arrest. we compared the effects of cggbp <dig> sirna in hct <dig> human colon cancer cell lines either wt or deficient for cdkn1a. cggbp <dig> depletion in hct <dig> cells null for cdkn1a was additionally confirmed by western blotting at different time points . cggbp <dig> sirna caused g0/g <dig> arrest in the cells irrespective of the cdkn1a genotype showing that cdkn1a is not required for cggbp <dig> depletion-induced cell cycle arrest . similar assay comparing wt or tp <dig> null hct <dig> cells  showed that even tp <dig> deficiency alone could not rescue cggbp <dig> sirna induced cell cycle arrest as both wt and tp <dig> null cells showed a similar g0/g <dig> arrest . transfection of control or cggbp <dig> sirna into u2os  and saos <dig>  cells showed that although the g0/g <dig> arrests were stronger in u2os than in saos <dig>  it did occur in both the cell lines . these results suggested that tp <dig> and cdkn1a are not single determinants of cell cycle regulation by cggbp <dig> 

we then investigated if the cell cycle inhibitors ink4a and arf are required for cggbp <dig> depletion induced g0/g <dig> arrest. using the rcas/tv-a system  <cit>  we established mouse glioma cell lines, derived from pdgfb induced tumors, in ntv-a  transgenic mice with wild type, ink4a-/- or arf-/- genetic backgrounds. one cell line from each genotype was tested for the effects of control or cggbp <dig> sirna on their cell cycle patterns. a g0/g <dig> arrest with reductions in s phase population was seen in all the three cell lines . these results established that ink4a and arf are not the master regulators of cggbp <dig> depletion induced g0/g <dig> arrest.

finally we tested if knocking down the gas <dig> levels in cggbp <dig> depleted cells would rescue the cggbp <dig> sirna-induced cell cycle arrest. equimolar amounts of control sirna, cggbp <dig> sirna, gas <dig> sirna or a 1: <dig> molar cocktail of cggbp <dig> and gas <dig> sirna were transfected into u- <dig> mg cells and later analyzed by flow cytometry. like cggbp <dig>  gas <dig> knockdown was confirmed by real time qrt-pcr . as compared to the control sirna, cggbp <dig> sirna produced a g0/g <dig> arrest as before , whereas the gas <dig> sirna alone produced a mild but insignificantly increased flux through s phase and a decrease in the g0/g <dig> population was seen . however, a combination of gas <dig> and cggbp <dig> sirna failed to rescue the g0/g <dig> arrest. surprisingly, we saw a further increase in the g0/g <dig> population and stronger reductions in the s- and g2/m phases . these results suggested that gas <dig> is not the key regulator of cggbp <dig> sirna-induced cell cycle arrest and that the increased efflux of cells from g0/g <dig> phase into the s-phase caused by gas <dig> knockdown is unsustainable in the absence of cggbp <dig> 

discussion
regulation of cell cycle through the g <dig> phase transition has been a hitherto unknown function of cggbp <dig>  our previous work has shown that cggbp <dig>  a transcription regulatory protein, participates in heat shock and related stress responses  <cit> , is a midbody protein with aurkb-like expression and is involved in abscission  <cit> .

of all the previously known functions of cggbp <dig>  its role in transcription  <cit>  has been evaluated here for the g0/g <dig> arrest phenotype observed in cancer cells in this study. our results show that transcription regulation of cell cycle regulatory genes is a mechanism through which cggbp <dig> might affect the cell cycle progression. while we found increases in the transcript levels of tp <dig> , cdkn1a, gas <dig> and arf  genes after cggbp <dig> depletion, we addressed the mechanism of expression regulation only for cdkn1a and gas <dig> genes as only for these genes the changes in transcript levels were correlated with a change in protein levels. we tested the histone acetylation and methylation profile of the cdkn1a and gas <dig> promoters and found that h3k <dig> trimethylation, a well-established transcription repressive histone modification  <cit>  was reduced and this reduction could well explain the increase in cdkn1a transcript levels. cggbp <dig> is known to require cgg triplet repeats to bind to the dna and execute its transcriptional regulatory functions. however, cdkn1a promoter in the present study has turned out to be a cgg-repeat-free region, which exhibits binding to cggbp <dig> and undergoes changes in h3k <dig> trimethylation upon cggbp <dig> depletion. this shows that cgg repeats are not absolutely required for cggbp <dig> binding and activity. h3k <dig> trimethylation could induce compaction of the chromatin and recruit chromobox domain containing proteins, which can in turn recruit transcription repressors to the locus  <cit> . h3k <dig> trimethylation can also result from and lead to cpg methylation of the dna interestingly, the region around the cdkn1a transcription site is gc-rich and could be subjected to changes in cpg methylation. similar observations about the changes in the histone modifications were also made at the gas <dig> locus, which is rich in small interrupted cgg repeats. while the levels of h3k <dig> acetylation were unaffected, h3k <dig> trimethylation were decreased. these results suggest that the control of h3k <dig> trimethylation is a mechanism by which cggbp <dig> manifests its effects on transcriptional regulation of different genes, including cdkn1a and gas <dig>  interestingly, cggbp <dig> has been reported to be a binding partner of suv39h <dig>  <cit> . suv39h <dig> has been shown to a member of the family of histone methyltransferases and can control histone h3k <dig> trimethylation levels  <cit> . how cggbp <dig> affects suv39h <dig> binding to the dna and affects its h3k <dig> tri-methylation activity will be an interesting topic for future work.

we could address the effects of the functional deficiencies of tp <dig>  cdkn1a, gas <dig>  ink4a and arf genes on cggbp <dig> sirna-induced g0/g <dig> arrest by testing the deficiencies of only one gene at a time, while the increased expression of these genes occur simultaneously upon cggbp <dig> depletion. our results show that none of these genes are single master regulators of the cell cycle regulatory events downstream of cggbp <dig>  due to the complexity of the signal transduction pathways, it is difficult to predict if a combined functional deficiency of these genes would rescue the effects of cggbp <dig> sirna on cell cycle progression or not. our conclusions are also confounded by the fact that the genotypes of the different cell types used in this study, at all major cell cycle regulatory genes, is not known and to establish them is beyond the scope of this study. nevertheless, using the matched background genotypes of hct <dig> cells, widely used p <dig> null and wt pairs of saos <dig> and u2os and combinations of sirnas against cggbp <dig> and gas <dig>  we can safely conclude that of tp <dig>  cdkn1a, gas <dig>  ink4a and arf, none alone is a critical master regulator of the g0/g <dig> arrest induced by cggbp <dig> depletion. these results underscore the fact that although multiple checkpoint escape mechanisms exist in different cancer cells, ablation of cggbp <dig> function compromises their ability to escape from the mechanisms blocking cell cycle in g0/g <dig> phase. cggbp <dig> thus regulates cell cycle through multiple parallel mechanisms and further studies on its mechanisms of action will be important in understanding how cancer cell proliferation could be controlled.

CONCLUSIONS
cggbp <dig> is required for the ability of cancer cells to progress cell cycle beyond g0/g <dig> phase even if they have single deficiencies of functional tp <dig>  cdkn1a, ink4a, arf and gas <dig> genes. this shows that the absence of cggbp <dig> overrides the ability of cancer cells to escape the cell cycle block at g0/g <dig> phase, conferred by lack of the above mentioned cell cycle regulatory genes. cggbp <dig> seems to regulate the passage through g0/g <dig> phase through multiple parallel mechanisms. our results necessitate investigations into expression and function of cggbp <dig> in cancers.
