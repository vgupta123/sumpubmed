BACKGROUND
micrornas  are a class of endogenous, small, non-coding, single-stranded rna. they comprise approximately 19– <dig> nucleotides that are embedded within the stem regions of hairpin transcripts   <cit> . the first mirna genes, lin- <dig>  <cit>  and let- <dig>  <cit> , were identified in caenorhabditis elegans about a decade ago. many endogenously encoded mirnas have been detected in mammals, plants, insects, worms, and viruses through cloning, northern blotting, microarray assay, sequencing of short rna molecules  <cit> , and computation  <cit> . by december  <dig>   <dig>  hairpin sequence entries, containing  <dig>  mature mirnas, have been stored in mirbase  <cit> . sequence analyses have shown that some mature mirnas are phylogenetically conserved, particularly in the first  <dig> residues at the 5' end in species of the same kingdom )  <cit> . in rare cases, mature mirna sequences are conserved between animals and plants. for instance, mir- <dig>  which is conserved in c. elegans, mouse, and human, has also been identified in plants  <cit> . however, hairpin sequences of precursor mirnas are phylogenetically diverse. in addition to these characteristics, the genomic locations of mirna precursor genes and the folding structures of mirnas have been used to identify previously unknown mirnas  <cit> . lai et al.   <cit>  stated that three characteristics allow mirna genes to be identified using computational approaches:  mirnas are generally derived from 70– <dig> nucleotide precursor transcripts having an extended stem-loop structure;  mirnas are usually conserved between genomes of related species; and  mirnas display a characteristic pattern of evolutionary divergence  <cit> . additionally, genomic mapping of known mirnas has enabled identification of orthologous mirnas in other species  where genomic annotations are lacking  <cit> .

mirnas are well-studied rna interference  molecules that silence gene expression of sequence-specific targeted messenger rnas  in all species in which they have been found  <cit> . mirnas silence gene expression by inducing mirna-guided mrna degradation, or by inhibiting translation by forming a mirna-protein complex that binds to targeted mrnas  <cit> . some mirnas target the non-coding region of a rna gene transcript  <cit> . mirnas are a class of small rnas that have temporal and spatial specific expression patterns, and that have important roles in the development, proliferation, differentiation, transformation, and death of cells  <cit> . mirnas affect cell fate during all stages of life, from renewable, pluripotent embryonic cells to fully differentiated cells; mirnas can also affect aberrant cell growth in some tumors and carcinomas  <cit> . the ability of mirnas to silence gene expression through a post-transcriptional mechanism has promoted their use as genetic tools in basic mechanistic studies; mirnas are also being developed as biomarkers, therapeutic targets and therapeutic agents.

based on computational cross-genome comparison predictions and experimental identifications, over  <dig>  mirnas have been identified in various organisms, including  <dig> mirnas from drosophila melanogaster,  <dig> from drosophila pseudoobscura,  <dig> from apis mellifera,  <dig> from anopheles gambiae,  <dig> from b. mori,  <dig> from c. elegans, and  <dig> human mirnas . b. mori is a species of arthropod, closely related to nematodes and platyhelminthes. mirbase contains  <dig> mirna genes in arthropods ,  <dig> in nematodes  and  <dig> in platyhelminthes   <cit> . of the  <dig> arthropod mirnas identified,  <dig> are b. mori mirnas that were predicted computationally by our research group  <cit> ; of these, only let- <dig> has been confirmed by northern blotting  <cit> .

in this study, we report the first set of b. mori mirna genes from larva, moth and pupa. we established our initial computational method for predicting mirnas by genome-wide mirna mapping using the available b. mori genomic sequences and arthropod mirnas. we further confirmed their identities using comprehensive microarray profiling and northern blotting. mirna targeted genes were predicted according to functional conservation and binding sites. biological classification of predicted targets was determined by go analysis.

RESULTS
prediction of b. mori mirnas
based on the sequences of all mirnas previously identified in arthropoda, we searched the b. mori genome by blast. according to the four criteria described in materials and methods, we identified  <dig> potential b. mori mirnas and their precursor sequences. information on predicted b. mori mirnas, including names, lengths, source, and genomic position, are listed in table  <dig>  the length of the  <dig> predicted b. mori mirnas ranged from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt. we used the mfold program to fold each of the  <dig> predicted b. mori pre-mirna sequences, ranging in length from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, and allowing g-u pairing, into hairpin structures  <cit> . the free energy of folding for these hairpin structures ranged from - <dig>  kcal/mol to - <dig>  kcal/mol.

mirna microarray assay
using the predicted b. mori mirnas as guides, we designed probes to hybridize to targets in total rna isolated from b. mori pupae and moths. probes were classified into one of three groups, i.e., those designed to detect: 1) the  <dig> predicted mirnas and their opposite-strand mirnas; 2) the  <dig> known mirnas in mirbase, which consist of mirnas from several species, including six worm species, d. melanogaster , d. pseudoobscura , a. gambiae , a. mellifera , c. elegans , c. briggsae , and human ; and 3) control sequences, including the 5s rrna of b. mori and d. melanogaster. the chip contained  <dig> probes in total. each probe was repeated three times on the chip to ensure assay reproducibility.

microarray results are shown in figure  <dig>  comparison of the signal strengths for the mirnas detected by microarray assays of rna isolated from b. mori pupa and moth stages are shown in figure  <dig>  in most cases, results between spots for the same mirna genes were very consistent in rna isolated from b. mori pupa and moth . however, expression levels of some mirnas exhibited obvious differences between the two developmental stages. sequences exhibiting signal strengths of > <dig> were considered to be detected mirna sequences. we detected  <dig> small rnas from total rna isolated from b. mori pupae and moths based on this cutoff. we applied a more stringent analysis by excluding mirnas differing by only one single base in their sequences or by two bases near sequence ends, and identified  <dig> mirnas and a novel small rna. of these  <dig> detected mirnas,  <dig> mirnas belonged to the  <dig> predicted mirnas and  <dig> mirnas were mirna*s; another  <dig> mirnas were detected only in the microarray assay using probes designed to detect known mirna from other species. we used these  <dig> mirna sequences as query sequences to perform blast searches against the b. mori genome. seven of these sequences were identified in the b. mori genome and their precursor sequences could be folded into hairpin structures and, as such, these seven sequences were likely to be b. mori mirnas. we designated these sequences bmo-mir-13a*, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir-46*, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-bantam. although bmo-mir-13a was one of the  <dig> mirnas that were predicted, it was not detected by microarray assay, but its opposite-strand mirna, named bmo-mir-13a*, was detected. the remaining  <dig> mirnas were detected by microarray assay, but were not found in the available b. mori genome . we considered these  <dig> mirnas to be plausible b. mori mirnas. a novel small rna was found using a probe designed to detect the known mirna aga-mir- <dig>  this small rna was detected by microarray and northern blotting  and was identified in the b. mori genome, but its precursor sequence failed to fold into a hairpin structure. this novel small rna was designated bmo-mir-100-like.

in conclusion, combining computational predictions with microarray assays, we identified  <dig> b. mori mirnas,  <dig> of which were mirna*s. we identified a novel small rna and  <dig> plausible b. mori mirnas that could not be found in the available b. mori genome, but which was detected by microarray. detailed information for these  <dig> mirnas and the novel small rna are listed in table  <dig>  the  <dig> plausible b. mori mirnas are listed in table  <dig> of additional file  <dig> 

identification and determination of development-specific expression patterns of b. mori mirnas by northern blotting
northern blotting was done based on microarray assay results to confirm the expression of b. mori mirnas. expression of the  <dig> identified mirnas, the novel small rna, and another  <dig> plausible mirnas was investigated by northern blotting of small-sized rnas isolated from the larva, pupa, and moth stages of b. mori. twenty-six mirnas were stably expressed in b. mori in at least one developmental stage . of these  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> belong to the group of  <dig> mirnas identified by microarray assay  and  <dig> belong to the group of  <dig> plausible b. mori mirnas ; the novel small rna bmo-mir-100-like is shown in figure 3a.

development-specific expression patterns for some b. mori mirnas were determined by northern blotting. some b. mori mirna genes were expressed only in certain stages . bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-let-7a, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir-276a, bmo-mir- <dig> were strongly expressed in all developmental stages . they were uniformly expressed, suggesting that these mirnas may play an important role in the regulation of some constitutive process in b. mori. of these mirnas, bmo-mir- <dig> has an opposite-strand mirna, bmo-mir-8*, which was detected by northern blotting  at very low levels in larva, pupa and moth. bmo-let-7b, bmo-let-7c, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir-9*, bmo-mir-100-like, bmo-mir-263a, bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-bantam were expressed in larva and pupa, but were not detected in moth; of these mirnas, bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir-9* are also complementary mirnas. bmo-mir-281a, bmo-mir-281a*, bmo-mir-281b*, bmo-mir-13b and bmo-mir-2b were expressed most strongly in larva, although they were also expressed in pupa and moth. bmo-mri-2a, bmo-mir- <dig>  bmo-mir-276b and bmo-let-7d were also expressed in larva, pupa and moth; bmo-mri-2a and bmo-mir- <dig> were expressed most strongly in pupa; bmo-mir-276b was expressed most strongly in moth; bmo-let-7d was expressed most weakly in moth. bmo-mir- <dig> was expressed only in moth and not detected in larva and pupa; the precursor of bmo-mir- <dig> was also detected . similarly, bmo-mir- <dig> was expressed weakly only in pupa and was not detected in larva and moth. expression of a mirna in a specific developmental stage may suggest a role for it in the developmental process.

computational prediction of b. mori mirna targets
in the tarbase database, there are  <dig> mirnas that regulate  <dig> targeted genes in d. elanogaster. mirna functions could be evolutionally conserved between species such as b. mori and d. melanogaster  <cit> . to deduce the function of b. mori mirnas, we searched for targeted genes of their orthologous mirnas reported in d. melanogaster in the tarbase database  <cit> . in the  <dig> b. mori mirnas identified, we found  <dig> mirnas, belonging to  <dig> mirna families; drosophila orthologs of these  <dig> mirnas have been reported in tarbase and are known to regulate the expression of at least  <dig> genes. these  <dig> mirnas may regulate  <dig> b. mori orthologs of the  <dig> drosophila mirna-targeted genes according to binding . bmo-mir- <dig> may regulate two b. mori orthologs of mus musculus mirna targeted genes, srf and ptbp <dig> because of the perfect binding between mirnas and the complementary sites. go analysis showed that "nucleus" was over-represented for drosophila orthologs of the  <dig> potential targeted genes.

we calculated the potential binding sites between mirnas and the 3'utr of mrnas to determine the potential mirna targeted genes more globally. with settings hybrid <dig> and hybridf <dig> described in materials and methods, we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> targeted genes, respectively. one hundred and eighty genes were involved in the two settings simultaneously. removing redundancy,  <dig> targeted genes including  <dig> target sites were predicted. of these binding sites,  <dig> had perfect base pairing to the seed region of  <dig> mirnas. of the  <dig> identified mirnas, bmo-mir- <dig> was the only one for which we failed to find target sites. certain mirnas may have more than one target, and some predicted targets may be regulated by more than one mirna . additionally, we found  <dig> 3'utrs that each contain multiple potential binding sites to a single mirna ; these mirna-mrna duplexes showed higher specificity than others. grun et al.  predicted that at least15% of d. melanogaster genes were regulated by at least one known mirna  <cit> . using settings hybrid <dig> , we found that 28%  of annotated  <dig> 3'utr sequences  had at least one binding site to mirnas identified in this study. compared with hybrid <dig>  hybridf <dig> showed a significantly higher specificity. biological classification of predicted mirna targets was done by go analysis to obtain insight into the function of b. mori mirnas. go analysis was completed by submitting gene sequences online . in the predicted targets with settings hybrid <dig> ,  <dig>  genes were assigned to the go terms of "molecular function" ontology by blast, "binding" and "catalytic activity" of which over-represented for the  <dig>  genes; in the "biological process" ontology, "physiological process" over-represented among the  <dig> genes which were predicted with setting hybrid <dig>  and assigned to go terms by blast .

discussion
we identified  <dig> mirnas from b. mori using computational analyses and microarray assays. of these  <dig> putative mirnas,  <dig> were also confirmed by northern blotting ; although the remaining mirnas were not detected by northern blotting, they were considered to be mirnas because they were detected by microarray and their precursors could adopt a hairpin structure. the reason why some mirnas could not be detected by northern blotting may be due to expression below the detection limit, or the very narrow temporal expression window for these mirnas.

methylated rna probes have been employed by some research groups for rna detection  <cit> . we found that methylation of the dna probe used to detect mirna by northern blotting could increase sensitivity. using methylated dna probes, signal strength was significantly improved in northern blots for bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir-8*, which could not be detected using non-methylated dna probes . improvement may be due to the effect of methylation on base pairing of the probe with the target, or on the secondary structure of the probe.

analysis of b. mori mirnas clusters
mirna clusters have been reported in many species. a cluster usually contains two or three mirna genes, although larger clusters have also been identified, such as the six-member hsa-mir- <dig> cluster  <cit>  or the d. melanogaster cluster containing eight mirna genes  <cit> . clustered mirna genes can share a high degree of similarity in nucleotide composition, but occasionally the mirna sequences differ significantly  <cit> . expression profiles for clustered genes are also very similar, raising the possibility that transcription of these mirnas is controlled by a common regulatory element  <cit> . examining the positions of the identified mirnas in the b. mori genome, we identified two mirna clusters : bmo-mir-2a-1/bmo-mir-2a-1*/bmo-mir-2a-2/bmo-mir-2b/bmo-mir-13a*/bmo-mir-13b; and bmo-mir-275/bmo-mir-305/bmo-mir-305*. the lengths of the two cluster sequences were  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively. genes in the cluster containing bmo-mir-2a-1/bmo-mir-2a-1*/bmo-mir-2a-2/bmo-mir-2b/bmo-mir-13a*/bmo-mir-13b are members of the mir- <dig> mirna family. this cluster contains bmo-mir-2a, which can be derived from two different precursor mirnas transcribed from two paralogous mirna genes, bmo-mir-2a- <dig> and bmo-mir-2a- <dig>  the opposite strand to bmo-mir-2a- <dig> also encodes a mirna. searching mirbase, we found that the bmo-mir-2a sequence was identical to the dme-mir-2a, dps-mir-2a, ame-mir- <dig>  and aga-mir- <dig> sequences, but we failed to identify any other mirna that had the same sequence as bmo-mir-2b ; therefore, bmo-mir-2b is a newly identified member of the mir- <dig> mirna family. searching the d. melanogaster and a. gambiae mirnas, we found that corresponding mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> family members also assembled into clusters in these two species. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> repress translation of the target genes, grim, skl and rpr, suggesting that they may be involved in regulating apoptosis  <cit> . the cluster bmo-mir-275/bmo-mir-305/bmo-mir-305* is also found in d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura and a. gambiae. bmo-mir- <dig> and bmo-mir- <dig> belong to different mirna families, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  the functions of these two mirna families remain unknown.

analysis of b. mori mirnas
the identified  <dig> b. mori mirnas belonged to  <dig> mirna families based on sequence similarity . among the  <dig> identified mirnas, we found  <dig> pairs of mirnas and mirna*s. scanning mirbase, we determined that seven of these  <dig> mirna*s had not been reported. these newly identified mirnas are bmo-mir-2a*, bmo-mir-8*, bmo-mir-13a*, bmo-mir-46*, bmo-mir-263*, bmo-mir-279*, and bmo-mir-305*.

family: the name of mirna family; count: the number of mirnas in other species in the same mirna family; similarity: the similarity between the sequences of b. mori mirnas and the sequences of other members of the same family; the letter "a" denotes that this mirna is identical to other mature mirnas in the family; * denotes that this mirna is only highly conserved in the mirna-encoding region; ** denotes that this mirna is highly conserved in the mirna-encoding region and its opposite-strand region ; *** ** denotes that this mirna is highly conserved in the precursor sequences.

observing the orthologous mirna genes for each family in mirbase, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> families are exclusive to arthropoda; the other  <dig> families are found in many species, including five species of arthropoda. mirnas having the most orthologs are mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which are found in  <dig> and  <dig> animal species, including d. melanogaster and c. elegans.

we determined the number of orthologous and paralogous genes for each detected mirna. the let- <dig> mirna family contains the most members;  <dig> let- <dig> family members were identified in mirbase .

analysis of b. mori precursor mirna sequences
variations in pre-mirna sequences are related to their evolutionary history  <cit> , so we compared the sequences of b. mori pre-mirnas and members of the same family of pre-mirnas in the mirbase database . the number of the pre-mirnas is greater than the number of mature mirnas because mature mirnas can be derived from two or more pre-mirnas. this is consistent with the literature: mature mirnas are conserved, but pre-mirnas are diverse  <cit> .

members of the bantam, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> mirna families have a high degree of similarity in their precursor sequences. bmo-mir- <dig> and other mir- <dig> precursor sequences have sequence similarities of >55%; bmo-mir- <dig> precursors share >56% sequence similarity; bmo-mir- <dig> precursors share >57% sequence similarity; bmo-mir- <dig> precursors share >59% sequence similarity; and bmo-bantam precursors share >60% sequence similarity.

based on the results of our sequence comparisons, we determined the phylogenetic tree for each mirna family using the dnastar megalign program to analyze evolutionary relationships between mirna members from each family. many of the b. mori mirna families were found only in arthropoda; their mature and pre-mirnas are highly conserved. for these mirnas, we found that these b. mori mirnas have close evolutionary relationships with a. mellifera, and a. gambiae mirnas. we found that these b. mori mirnas are located on the same branches of the phylogenetic tree as related mirnas from d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura, a. mellifera, and a. gambiae. the phylogenetic tree for the mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mirna family is shown in figure 6; other detailed results are listed in additional file  <dig> 

we compared the hairpin structures of b. mori mirna precursor sequences to those of related d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura, a. mellifera, and a. gambiae mirna precursor sequences. conserved regions of the precursors are found in two arms of the stem-loop structure. the results of comparisons between the hairpin structures of bmo-mir- <dig>  aga-mir- <dig>  ame-mir- <dig>  dme-mir- <dig> and dps-mir- <dig> precursors are shown in figure  <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows the secondary structures of b. mori mirnas. these results strongly indicate that the identified  <dig> b. mori sequences are mirnas.

computational prediction of b. mori mirna targets
mirna can regulate the protein expression of genes based on the level of complementarity between mirna seed sequences and binding sites on target mrna  <cit> . for animals, the seed sequences of mirna can bind to complementary sites on 3'utr of its targeted gene. complementary sites in targeted genes and seed sequences of mirnas may be conserved in various species; this may result in the functional conservation of mirnas, and the orthologous mirnas may regulate orthologs of the targeted genes. the prediction for mirna targeted genes according to functional conservation may offer additional insights into the function of mirnas. grun et al.  computed the conserved regulatory microrna-mrna relationships  <cit> . they found that  <dig> unique gene pairs were predicted to be targeted by homologous micrornas, including  <dig> microrna-mrna regulatory relationships  <cit> . weaver et al.  demonstrated that some micrornas function in the same or similar way in drosophila and bee  between drosophila and bee)  <cit> . functional prediction based on cross-species conservation may provide a reference for studying on the functions of b. mori mirnas. based on this method, we identified  <dig> mirnas that regulate  <dig> potential targeted genes . most drosophila orthologs of these potential targeted genes were the vital genes for development, including transcriptional regulator, apoptosis-related genes and genes involved in signal transduction pathways. mir- <dig> controls hlhmdelta, and mir- <dig> controls hlhm <dig>  hlhm <dig>  hlhmgamma, m <dig> and tom, in d. melanogaster; these six genes are involved in the notch signaling pathway. b. mori homologs  of these six genes can bind perfectly to mir- <dig>  and bmo-mir- <dig>  respectively. mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may be related to the notch signaling pathway in b. mori; this hypothesis is consistent with previous predictions  <cit> . cross-species comparisons allow for the identification of evolutionarily conserved and probable functional target sites. the  <dig> mirnas could play parts in the development of b. mori by regulating their targeted genes, including the  <dig> potential targeted genes identified in this study.

we predicted many mirna targeted genes by calculating target sites. interestingly, we have studied b. mori profilin gene ; there was not a linear relationship between the transcription level of this gene and protein expression . the long 3'utr of this gene was found to have nine potential binding sites . profilin plays an important part in biologically active cellular compartments  <cit> . it regulates the polymerization, depolymerization, and dynamics of actin, which are important for determining cell shape and movement through the cytoplasm  <cit> .

we can predict mirna targets specifically according to the level of complementarity between the seed region of mirna and 3'utr of mrna  <cit> . we set stringent settings for base pairing of binding sites  based on this knowledge. applying these settings, many targets predicted by functional conservation, such as b. mori homologs of hlhmdelta and m <dig>  would not have been predicted because of stringent filtering of the settings for mirna-mrna duplexes. however, using the settings, the predicted binding sites of targets can bind perfectly to mirna, and the target sites belong mainly to the three categories of known mirna target sites classified by sethupathy et al.  <cit>  . nevertheless, we identified too many potential binding sites to test experimentally. according to a previous suggestion  <cit> , genes with multiple predicted target sites  should be considered strong candidates for future functional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified  <dig> b. mori mirnas,  <dig> of which were mirna*s, by combining computational predictions with microarray assays. we identified a novel small rna and  <dig> plausible b. mori mirnas that could not be found in the available b. mori genome, but which were detected by microarray. the small novel rna, bmo-mir-100-like, was identified using the known mirna aga-mir- <dig> as a probe; it was detected by microarray assay and northern blotting, but its precursor sequences failed to fold into a hairpin structure. northern blotting revealed that some b. mori mirna genes were expressed only during specific stages, indicating that b. mori mirna genes have developmentally regulated expression patterns. for example, bmo-mir- <dig> was expressed only during the moth stage. we identified two mirna gene clusters in the b. mori genome, and bmo-mir-2b was identified as a new member of the mir- <dig> family. we found that methylation of the dna probe used to detect the mirna by northern blotting may increase its sensitivity. according to functional conservation in various species, we predicted that  <dig> mirnas may regulate  <dig> b. mori orthologs of the  <dig> known drosophila mirna-targeted genes. a total of  <dig> targeted genes were predicted from  <dig> b. mori genes according to the target sites predicted by settings hybrid <dig> and hybridf <dig>  from the predicted genes,  <dig> genes each contained multiple predicted target sites and could be candidates for the functional study of mirna. three go terms, "binding", "catalytic activity" and "physiological process", were over-represented for the predicted genes.

identification of putative mirnas in other organisms is a worthwhile approach for increasing the understanding of the roles of mirna. identification of mirnas in b. mori may help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying simple and complex regulation of the 42-day lifecycle of b. mori, which consists of six periods of ecdysis and four periods of metamorphosis.
