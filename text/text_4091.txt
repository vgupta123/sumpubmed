BACKGROUND
porcine circovirus type  <dig>  is associated with a number of disease syndromes and in recent years, ‘porcine circovirus associated diseases’  have been considered to have severe negative impact on global pig production  <cit> . before availability of pcv <dig> vaccines, control of pcvd was focused on assuring good management and hygiene measures as well as reducing co-infections  <cit> . in  <dig> the first pcv <dig> piglet vaccine was authorized in europe. safety and efficacy of that vaccine was confirmed in field studies for registration according to good clinical practice  <cit> . in these negative controlled, blinded studies possible confounding factors are excluded to a large extent, allowing the detailed evaluation of vaccine safety  and efficacy under specific conditions. vaccine efficacy is often determined by serological testing for specific antibodies, quantification of viral load in the serum and measuring production parameters such as daily weight gain and mortality. due to practical reasons such controlled studies can only be performed in a limited number of herds which does not allow inclusion of the numerous factors that may have an impact on vaccine efficacy and safety in the field. the use of a telephone survey based on a subjective scaling system potentially allows the collection of data from a large number of herds representing a broad spectrum of typical conditions found in the field.

in the case of pcv <dig>  the collection and evaluation of reliable and representative data from field trials on a larger scale is potentially complex since pcvd comprises different disease complexes  <cit>  and can therefore have an impact on a large range of herd parameters. since the reasons for applying a pcv <dig> vaccine can be varied , the assessment of only one or two parameters may not be appropriate to sufficiently measure the vaccine efficacy. furthermore, the collection of only a few selected herd parameters would not take into consideration the farmers’ and veterinarians’ subjective experiences with the vaccine, which might be a good predictor for safety and efficacy. in addition, the collection of reliable and standardised production data, as recorded in randomised and controlled clinical trials, may not be feasible when the vaccine is used in a large number of herds. in such cases ‘interviews’ seem to be a valuable tool to estimate safety and efficacy. when assessing individual and subjective experiences by means of interviews, investigators should take into account that the type of questioning can largely influence the validity and reliability of data  <cit> . moreover, pre-tested questions for identical aspects should be used to improve the quality of information  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to evaluate to which extent a telephone poll is in general applicable to better understand the factors influencing the performance of a vaccine in a large number of herds and to estimate customers’ satisfaction .

methods
in february  <dig>  ingelvac circoflex®  received marketing authorization in the european union. since  <dig>  it was possible to use the product in germany with a conditional license according to §17c tierseuchengesetz . the objective of this telephone survey based study was to collect and evaluate data from  <dig> which could indicate ‘safety’ and ‘efficacy’, as well as to characterise factors influencing veterinarians’ and farmers’ satisfaction with ingelvac circoflex®.

development and pre-testing of the questionnaire
a standardised questionnaire  was developed including  <dig> variables focussing on herd health, management, vaccination, husbandry, hygiene and on customer satisfaction . in order to receive consistently structured answers,  <dig> variables were assessed by closed questions . further experiences and occasional records were assessed by means of open questions . for the purpose of validation, i.e. pre-testing, the principal investigator  contacted  <dig> farmers and their herd attending veterinarians, who had also used the pcv <dig> vaccine prior to authorization. they were all located in the south of germany and their data was not included in the final analysis. during these exploratory telephone interviews, misunderstandings, unclear questions, missing variable levels, i.e. potential answers, were identified and the time needed for the individual interview, as well as the overall feasibility of the technique were evaluated. subsequently, the questionnaire was revised according to the results of the validation process.

inclusion and exclusion criteria
according to the officially granted, farm-individual permissions in six german federal states covering the area of northern germany , the pcv <dig> vaccine had been used in  <dig> herds before the product was finally authorized. the contact details of these herds  and their attending veterinarians  were provided by the manufacturer of the vaccine in compliance with german data protection rules.

all these herds including their veterinarians were proposed to be included in the study and had been contacted by the principle investigator. if farmers or veterinarians refused voluntary participation, had not used the product although they had requested it or were unavailable due to other reasons , these herds were excluded from the study.

data collection
practitioners were firstly contacted by post, explaining the aim and scope of the study, announcing that the interview will take place within the next seven days and indicating that the participation in the study is voluntary. subsequently, veterinarians and the corresponding farmers were interviewed by the principal investigator. each record was then entered into a digital form containing tick-boxes, drop-down menus and integer fields for coding and/or categorising given answers . macros and ‘if-then’ logics were used to check plausibility of the data entered within each filled form.

statistical analysis
in a first step, all variables assessed during the interviews were assigned to the group of dependent or to the group of independent variables. overall  <dig> variables evaluating the subjective satisfaction with the vaccine were assigned to the group of y-variables . the variables il_ <dig> and il_ <dig> are assessing the  current mortality among fattening pigs in the farm and the  reduction of mortality after introduction of the vaccination in the particular farm. these questions have been answered with absolute values instead of rating on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig> and, thus are answers are not shown in table  <dig>  the other  <dig> variables comprised by various information about diagnostics, vaccination, housing, management, were considered as x-variables .table  <dig>

in this study 1-, 2- and 3-site production systems were surveyed. for the purpose of sound analysis, the herds were further investigated in two different subsets, in which only applicable variables were further tested. group  <dig> was comprised by  <dig> herds, which all housed nursery pigs . all  <dig> herds in group  <dig> kept fattening pigs  and only optional other age and production groups . overall  <dig> herds were analysed in both subsets, because the kept nursery pigs  and fattening pigs . this concept of potentially using herds in both subsets is justified by the pigs’ age-dependent separation of factors that have been further analysed in each group. any potential bias due to this procedure will be discussed accordingly.

due to the unexpected almost unanimous positive response, the statistical data analysis was done in a stepwise procedure:descriptive univariate analysis for x and y variables of the raw dataset. this dataset included all variables of the questionnaire and all answers given by farmers of  <dig> appropriate herds and their veterinarians.

descriptive univariate analysis for x and y variables of the final dataset. in this dataset, herds with missing values in either variable were omitted because this resulted in conflicts with the tests used for further analysis . the final analysis included  <dig> herds for group  <dig> and  <dig> herds for group  <dig> 



the subsequent analysis for the final dataset consists of the following steps:a principal components analysis  for the responses y to analyse the dependencies among them. the examination was carried out separately for group  <dig> and group  <dig>  principal components explaining similarity within this data were calculated and subsequently visualised using proc%biplot macro  <cit> .

a cluster analysis to construct distinct clusters of items showing similar scoring pattern for all responses. this approach was chosen, because a correlation analysis and modelling of x variables and individual responses or subsets is considered to yield no satisfactory results due to the low percentages of individual scores ≥ <dig>  cluster analyses were performed for group  <dig> and group  <dig>  respectively. herds were clustered according to the scoring given for each dependent variable . two sets of herds were guessed representing ‘high satisfaction’  and ‘moderate satisfaction’  among farmers and veterinarians. the outcome of this analysis was plotted in two dimensions obtained from the principal component analysis. dependent variables were dropped from further data processing, when they were not adding discriminative power to the cluster analysis .

the resulting clusters formed with variables that had not been dropped  were investigated for associations between the cluster variables and x-variables in order to identify which factors might influence customer satisfaction. these bivariate relations were analysed with fisher’s exact test and the calculation of odds ratios  including confidence intervals , i.e. the comparison between green and red clusters. this procedure was run for corresponding variables of group  <dig> and group  <dig>  variables were selected for further in-depth analysis, if the p-value of the fisher-exact test was < <dig> , the minimum cell count in every cell was > <dig> and/or the association with the outcome variable was ‘biologically sound’. moreover, independent variables were dropped when missing values were observed.

a forward stepwise logistic regression model was fit to the relevant x variables considering main effects as well as two-way interactions. for the resulting final model the odds ratios of the included effects were estimated. the aim of the final analysis was to estimate the influence of the independent variables on the outcome considering potential two-way interactions among variables. therefore, an automated stepwise logistic regression model was developed , option oddsratio). the model was applied to data from group  <dig> and group  <dig> 



data analysis was performed using the statistical analysis system  for windows version  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

this study was conducted in accordance with the research ethics requirements of the university of veterinary medicine hannover. due to the nature of the study and the low risk posed to participants, formal approval from the ethics committee was not a requirement at the time of the study. potential participants were contacted by post with information explaining the purpose and nature of the study and inviting participation.

participants were informed that their data would be kept anonymous and securely, and that any material potentially leading to identification would be removed. subsequently, potential participants were contacted by telephone in order to provide further information. participants were asked to provide verbal consent prior to the interview and it was made clear that by agreeing to be interviewed, they were agreeing to be part of the study.

RESULTS
data from  <dig> herds were collected in this study, corresponding to a response rate of  <dig> %. reasons for non-response to this survey  were:  retirement, bankruptcy or death of the farmer or the veterinarian between the start of vaccination and the suggested time of the interview,  vaccine not used, although farmer and veterinarian had asked for a permission,  the herd attending veterinarian changed during the course of the evaluated time period, or  the vaccine was not used for a sufficient time period .

sixteen herds had to be excluded from the dataset, because either herds were selling all suckling pigs , were vaccinating only gilts during their acclimatisation period , their owner was not willing to participate in the telephone survey , or the farmer was not using the vaccine in question . in conclusion, in-depth analysis was performed based on data from  <dig> herds. group  <dig> was comprised of  <dig> herds .

the level of ‘satisfaction’ with the pcv <dig> vaccine was consistently high in group  <dig> and group  <dig>  particularly the efficiency, compatibility and handling of the vaccine received good to excellent evaluations by the majority of veterinarians and farmers, respectively. due to this one-sided positive response sensitive multivariate tests  were used for further statistical analysis.descriptive univariate analysis



pre-selected independent x-variables and their levels are described in table  <dig>  for variables that assessed perceptions and remarks  a grouping of answers was not possible. thus these  <dig> variables were omitted from the dataset. a further screening was conducted to identify variables associated with the ‘outcome’.table  <dig>

b) principal component analysis



in order to analyse the relations among the responses, a principal components analysis was done for the y variables:group 1:

i_ <dig> , d_ <dig>  i_ <dig>  ii_ <dig> , d_ <dig>  ii_ <dig>  d_ <dig> , ii_ <dig> , ii_35

group 2:

i_ <dig> , d_ <dig>  i_ <dig>  ii_ <dig> , d_ <dig>  ii_ <dig>  d_ <dig>  ii_ <dig>  d_ <dig>  ii_ <dig> , ii_35



the results are visualized in biplots for the first two dimensions, explaining approximately 47% of the data variability for group  <dig>  and approximately 42% for group  <dig> . the plots show the correlation structure of the responses, in which several groups of two or more correlated responses can be identified.figure  <dig>

some correlation between the dependent variables was observed, e.g. between ii_ <dig>   and ii_ <dig> , but this could be confirmed only for group  <dig> and not for group  <dig>  in contrast, the variables d_ <dig> ’) and i_ <dig>  ?’) do not seem to be correlated. conclusively, the results of the principal component analysis did not lead to a further reduction of dependent variables or selection of a representative dependent variable, because of the correlation structure amongst them.c) cluster analysis



the clustering procedure was done for the same response as for the principal component analysis via the sas® procedure proc fastclus  - user’s guide version  <dig>  sas® institute inc – cary nc) using the k-means method. the applied procedure resulted in two distinct clusters for each group:green cluster with n = <dig> for group  <dig> and n = <dig> for group  <dig> 

red cluster with n = <dig> for group  <dig> and n = <dig> for group  <dig> 



as a graphical representation of the clustering results, the green and red cluster were coloured in the pca biplots  showing a quite good cluster separation in the first two dimensions . with exception of i_ <dig>  ?’), on average the green cluster has lower  scores than the red cluster and the highest differences can be seen for the responses ii_ <dig>   and ii_ <dig> .figure  <dig>

d) selection of independent variables and test of association

e) logistic regression model



on the basis of the cluster analyses and the selected eight x-variables two logistic regression models were used for group  <dig> and group  <dig>  respectively, with the forward  stepwise model selection option allowing for the inclusion of main effects and two-way interaction terms. not considered in this selection were the variables ii_ <dig>  and i_ <dig> . the procedure led to the following x variables in a final modelgroup 1: ‘diagnosis of other diseases than pcvd’, ‘frequency of iron injection in piglets’, ‘reasons for using the vaccine’, combination of ‘diagnosis of other diseases than pcvd’ and ‘reasons for using the vaccine’

group 2: ‘actual use of the pcv <dig> vaccine at the time of the interview’, ‘time of vaccinating piglets not changed or changed to another point in piglets’ life’



overall, only a few variables could be identified as influencing veterinarians’ and farmers’ ‘satisfaction’ with the pcv <dig> vaccine. these variables were not identical in group  <dig> and group  <dig> . this indicates that satisfaction among piglet producers, owners of only fattening pigs and farmers operating a 1-site production system may be influenced by different criteria.table  <dig>

discussion
the primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the reliability of operational data from pig herds and performance ratings by veterinarians and farmers collected during telephone interviews for the assessment of the ‘safety’ and ‘efficacy’ of a specific pcv <dig> vaccination in piglets. to the best knowledge of the authors, the feasibility of a telephone survey as an instrument for examining different drivers of using a vaccine in livestock, and as for examining its safety and efficacy in a large number of herds has not been described before.

telephone interviews with customers, usually aimed to gather information about satisfaction with products or to explore the expectations of clients, are a frequently applied technique in the context of market research  <cit> . in contrast, veterinary research, especially in livestock animals, is mainly linked with classical on-farm interviews followed by an examination of the animals, the environment and the management. this procedure is currently ranked as the ‘gold standard’ and scientific reports based exclusively on interviews by telephone are rarely published. interestingly, data obtained during a face to face interview can be of lower quality than such data collected via a telephone interview, because in the anonymous situation of a telephone call, the interviewees are more likely to give answers reflecting the reality  <cit> . moreover, the latter technique is more cost effective than on-site visits and, if a considerable number of cases is investigated, is more time efficient  <cit> . the present study was to be performed under economic constraints as well as during a short time period. therefore, a telephone survey was considered as the method of choice.

the response rate of about 80%, achieved in the present study, was considered to be highly satisfactory. analysing the reasons for non-responding, it can be assumed that no bias was introduced by those veterinarians and farmers who had refused their participation. other studies applying telephone interviews as the investigational tool have reported significantly lower response rates, but were still seen as relevant  <cit> .

measures of the safety and efficacy of the pcv <dig> vaccine involved were extrapolated from parameters assessing farmers’ and veterinarians’ overall ‘satisfaction’ with the product. this approach was chosen, because the comparison of this subjective data is more reliable than using production data , if these data have not been determined under standardized conditions  <cit> . marking with a nominal scale from  <dig>  to  <dig>  usually represents accurately the personal experience with a product. calculating the increase or decrease after the introduction of any procedure allows for a comparison of relative values describing the effect of this procedure on the corresponding parameter. it is noteworthy that the relative values can be biased by professional marketing activities as has been shown for pharmaceuticals in human medicine  <cit> , but this would usually affect only the magnitude and not the trend of the figures.

in order to determine the ‘satisfaction’  and to explore related parameters , two different statistical methods were tested for their suitability to separate different multivariate outcomes. the principal components analysis did not lead to a further reduction of the dependent variables or the identification of representative dependent variables. the cluster analysis resulted in a sufficient separation of highly and less satisfied cases. further tests for association and modelling approaches were conducted using the two clusters, which had been identified with this descriptive method. in this specific study the principal component analysis was not able to reduce the dependent variables or identify representative dependent variables due to the almost unanimous positive response when asked for the satisfaction with the pcv <dig> vaccination. however, for a similar type of study, the same set of statistical methods would be applied in the same order and a principal component analysis might in this case result in a reduction of the dependent variables, which would be used as input for a subsequent cluster analysis and/or modelling approach.

interestingly, only very few of the parameters listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig> were associated with the overall satisfaction with the vaccine. finally, three parameters for group  <dig> and two for group  <dig> were identified as ‘risk factors’ influencing the overall ‘satisfaction’ with the vaccine . farmers and veterinarians were less satisfied, when reasons for using the vaccine were not pcvd, wasting and/or mortality, but any other disease in the farm, which had not been properly diagnosed. these findings are conclusive since any effect of the vaccine in the absence of pcvd, or other diseases associated with pcv <dig> infection  <cit> , is unlikely. hence, these biologically sound results underline the suitability of the methods used in this study. the apparently protective effect of applying iron to piglets only once instead of twice cannot be explained. in humans, iron overload is associated with reduced phagocytosis by macrophages and monocytes  <cit>  and a decrease of the efficiency of the unspecific immune system  <cit> . whether these effects also occur in pigs and could impact the efficacy of any vaccination remains speculative. in group  <dig> the ‘satisfaction’ with the vaccine was associated with the time when the pigs were vaccinated. taking the large confidence intervals into account, the results should be interpreted with caution, if at all  <cit> .

overall there was very little influence on the generally excellent satisfaction rate found in this study, which is in line with the pcv <dig> vaccine evaluated in this study having the highest global market shares as shown by market research figures  <cit> . the overall approach used in this study was feasible to scientifically assess ‘satisfaction’, and to determine factors influencing farmers’ and veterinarians’ opinion about ‘safety’, ‘efficacy’ and handling of a new vaccine. since no strong associations were found between ‘dissatisfaction of users’ and the various parameters assessed in this study, it can be assumed that vaccine’s safety profile is high and that potential factors leading to a decreased efficacy of the product do not play any role under field conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
it was demonstrated that a telephone survey using standardised questionnaires may be an efficient method to investigate safety and efficacy aspects of vaccines as well as customer satisfaction on a broad basis. however, due to the unexpected almost unanimous positive response to the vaccine, the present study does not allow a conclusive evaluation of the use of telephone surveys in general. nonetheless, this study describes a suitable example of how data from field trials including a large number of herds could be assessed and analysed.
