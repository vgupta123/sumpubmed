BACKGROUND
with the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy  for treating human immunodeficiency virus type  <dig>  infection, mortality rates from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  have significantly decreased in recent years  <cit> . haart encompasses a variety of treatment strategies, each employing a distinct combination of at least three drugs designed to inhibit proteins essential to the viral replication cycle  <cit> . the hiv- <dig> protease  and reverse transcriptase  enzymes are critical targets of these drug cocktails, and the u.s. food and drug administration  has approved a number of pr inhibitors  as well as nucleoside/nucleotide and nonnucleoside rt inhibitors . nevertheless, the evolution of drug resistant mutations in the pr and rt proteins poses a persistent risk to continued treatment success. the potential for any drug resistant mutation in either target to confer cross-resistance to other medications in the respective inhibitor class also raises a significant impediment to selecting optimal therapies. consequently, a systematic understanding of how alternative mutational patterns in these target proteins affect susceptibility levels to their respective inhibitors is of vital importance in providing effective, personalized haart regimens.

of the three classes of hiv- <dig> drugs described above, pis and nrtis represent competitive inhibitors designed to bind relatively conserved active sites of the hiv- <dig> pr and rt enzymes. on the other hand, nnrtis are non-competitive inhibitors that bind a less conserved hydrophobic pocket of rt near the active site   <cit> , resulting in conformational changes to the enzyme that prevent its polymerization activity. amino acid substitutions in the pr and rt proteins associated with drug resistance fall into two general categories: major and minor  <cit> . major mutations are single residue replacements that alone are capable of significantly decreasing the susceptibility to one or more drugs in a particular class, they generally occur either at positions forming the inhibitor binding site or at nearby positions affecting its geometry, and they frequently appear in clinical samples sequenced from patients experiencing virologic failure. substrate binding and catalytic activity of the pr and rt enzymes are negatively impacted by major mutations associated with inhibitors that bind the protein active sites. subsequently, minor mutations may appear either to increase marginally the level of drug resistance , or to create structural rearrangements that help restore enzyme activity and improve viral fitness   <cit> . minor mutations may appear either near the substrate or inhibitor binding sites, or they may exert their effects allosterically from structurally distant positions. a number of natural polymorphisms in untreated patients that may slightly increase drug resistance are also referred to as minor mutations.

genotype tests are available for rapidly and inexpensively discerning whether mutations already known to be associated with inhibitor resistance are present in hiv- <dig> pr and rt sequences. relatively more time consuming and costly phenotype testing, on the other hand, quantitatively measures the change in susceptibility of a mutant pr or rt target protein to an inhibitor relative to that of a drug-sensitive control. hence, a number of algorithmic approaches have been developed over the past decade for the prediction of phenotype from genotype  <cit> , including models trained using statistical machine learning techniques  <cit> . studies have alternatively focused on structure-based prediction of resistance patterns, using approaches as varied as molecular modeling  <cit> , fitness evolution  <cit> , molecular dynamics simulations  <cit> , and statistical learning  <cit> . additionally, recent efforts have evaluated the inclusion of clinical data based on known patient outcomes as supplementary attributes  <cit> .

employing a sequence-based approach, rhee et al.  <cit>  previously applied five statistical learning methods to sets of hiv- <dig> pr and rt mutants available from the stanford university hiv drug resistance database  <cit>  in order to systematically develop predictive models of resistance to each of  <dig> inhibitors. the goal of the present study is to implement distinct structure and sequence based approaches, previously not considered in this arena, and to apply four learning methods , in order to develop and compare a comprehensive set of predictive models of pr and rt resistance to  <dig> antiretroviral drugs . for model training and testing we rely on updated versions of the same datasets from the stanford database as those that were employed in the key study of rhee et al.  <cit> .

as detailed in the methods, our structure-based technique involves threading of mutant amino acid sequences onto native pr and rt structures obtained from the protein data bank   <cit> , as well as application of a computational mutagenesis methodology incorporating a four-body, knowledge-based, statistical potential energy function  <cit> . for each pr or rt mutational pattern, this approach allows us to quantify both an overall change in protein sequence-structure compatibility relative to wild-type  as well as ensuing environmental perturbations  at all constituent amino acid positions in the target protein structure, the latter of which define attributes for a feature vector representation of the mutant. our performance measures are similar to those reported by the stanford group in rhee et al.  <cit> , despite the relatively smaller sizes of our training sets, with both techniques representing orthogonal prediction strategies. lastly, we summarize results of complementary sequence-based models that utilize previously unexplored attributes for mutant pr and rt feature vectors obtained through two applications of n-grams , which we refer to as relative frequency and counts methods  <cit> .

RESULTS
inhibitor datasets
brand names and abbreviations for the inhibitors under consideration are provided in table  <dig> , along with the distribution of sensitive , intermediate , and resistant  susceptibilities for each corresponding dataset of mutants. sixteen of our  <dig> inhibitor datasets overlap with those of the sequence-based study by the stanford group , though the total number of mutants in each of our datasets is substantially lower since we exclude all isolates displaying electrophoretic mixtures of amino acids at any hiv- <dig> pr or rt sequence position, whereas rhee et al. only excluded isolates with mixtures occurring at nonpolymorphic drug resistance positions in those proteins. despite absolute size differences between comparable pairs of inhibitor datasets in our work and in the study by the stanford group, the distribution of mutants across each of the three drug susceptibility categories over these  <dig> pairs of datasets are highly correlated , suggesting similarly stratified datasets in both studies.

a s, sensitive; i, intermediate; r, resistant. category thresholds are discussed in methods.

structure-function relationships
implementation of our computational mutagenesis technique as detailed in the methods allowed for the calculation of residual scores for all the hiv- <dig> pr and rt mutants, which we used to obtain a mean residual score by susceptibility category  within each of the  <dig> inhibitor datasets. for a given susceptibility category, the overall average was determined for the associated mean residual scores over all  <dig> inhibitor datasets , as well as separate averages only over those datasets that belong to each inhibitor class . a clear trend based on these data is evident in figure  <dig>  whereby mean residual scores decrease with increasing resistance. given the quantitative definition of a mutant residual score and its interpretation, the results suggest that pr and rt mutants having increasingly detrimental effects on protein sequence-structure compatibility are also those that are more likely to be associated with a greater degree of drug resistance.

structure-based mutant attributes and statistical learning techniques
following a procedure similar to that described in rhee et al.  <cit> , hiv- <dig> pr or rt mutants comprising the inhibitor datasets are represented as training sets of feature vectors for the learning algorithms based on three distinct sets of attributes as components . the first approach makes use of the entire residual profile  for each mutant. next, we consider mutant feature vectors whose components consist of the ec scores only at pr or rt positions for which residue substitutions occur that, according to an expert panel , are associated with drug resistance  <cit> . finally, we evaluate the utility of mutant feature vectors whose components consist of the ec scores at pr or rt positions for which residue substitutions occur that are significantly more common in treated versus untreated individuals   <cit> .

implementations of two classification  and two regression  statistical learning methods are used in conjunction with each of the three representations of our  <dig> inhibitor datasets of hiv- <dig> pr and rt mutants as described in the previous paragraph. for a given inhibitor dataset of mutants, the rf and svm methods predict the susceptibility of each mutant to that inhibitor as sensitive , intermediate , or resistant . on the other hand, the regression methods predict for each pr or rt mutant a numerical value for the change in susceptibility to the inhibitor relative to that of a drug-sensitive, wild-type protein; subsequently, these predicted values are used for classifying the mutants based on category thresholds.

structure-based classification and regression summaries
mean prediction accuracies  are equivalent for the pis , nrtis , and nnrtis , with no single inhibitor class displaying a selective advantage over another  . comparisons with results reported in the sequence-based study by the stanford group  reveals statistically significant differences for the latter two classes of inhibitors , reflecting our prediction superiority with the nrtis and that of the stanford group with the nnrtis. inhibitors displaying the highest and lowest mean accuracy, respectively by class, in table  <dig> of our study are ritonavir  and atazanavir  for the pis; emtricitabine  and tenofovir  for the nrtis; and nevirapine  and delavirdine  for the nnrtis. these results mirror those reported by the stanford group, with the exception that in their work, the nrti lamivudine took the place of the newer and structurally similar emtricitabine, since data for the latter drug was not available at the time; in our study, lamivudine displays the second highest mean accuracy  after emtricitabine among the nrtis.

averaging over  <dig> inhibitors and three attribute datasets, the mean accuracies of the learning methods are  <dig> % for rf,  <dig> % for reptree,  <dig> % for svm, and  <dig> % for svr. this is due to the fact that with respect to each of the three attribute datasets individually, rf significantly outperforms each of the other three learning methods; for example, based only on datasets using ec scores at all positions , the mean accuracy of rf  is significantly higher than those of reptree , svr , or svm . classification methods  display higher accuracy for the nnrtis than regression methods ; however, no such differences are observed between the methods for the pis or nrtis. finally, averaging over all  <dig> inhibitors and four learning methods, no statistically significant differences are seen between the mean accuracies of the tsm , all , and ias  attribute datasets .

in addition to the overall prediction accuracy, we calculated the balanced error rate  and the area  under the receiver operating characteristic  curve for the rf and svm classification methods . averaged over all  <dig> inhibitors and three attribute datasets, the mean ber and auc values for rf  are superior to those for svm ; however, only auc differences are statistically significant , a result which also holds for each attribute dataset separately. next, averaged over all attribute datasets and both learning methods, the mean ber and auc values for the pis , nrtis , and nnrtis  reflect no statistically significant ber differences between any pair of inhibitor classes. on the other hand, statistically significant auc differences exist between the pis and each of the other inhibitor classes . the tsm datasets yield mean ber and auc values  that are superior to those of the all  and ias  datasets when averaged over all  <dig> inhibitors and both learning methods, though the differences are not significant. lastly, out-of-bag  errors associated with all rf classifications are tabulated  and display no statistically significant differences when averaged over either the inhibitor classes or the attribute datasets.

considering all  <dig> inhibitors as well as both the reptree and svr regression methods, tsm datasets display the highest overall correlation coefficients  between actual and predicted relative susceptibility levels of the constituent hiv- <dig> pr and rt mutants , a result similarly reported by the stanford group . however, overall differences between our three attribute datasets are minimal . for the tsm datasets, our averaged r <dig> values obtained from both regression methods are  <dig>  over the pis,  <dig>  over the nrtis, and  <dig>  over the nnrtis. over the  <dig> inhibitors and both regression methods, our averaged mean-squared error  values are  <dig>  for tsm,  <dig>  for all, and  <dig>  for ias datasets , results which coincide with those of the stanford group for the tsm datasets ; however with respect to the ias datasets, our averaged mse values are substantially lower than those of the stanford group . for our tsm datasets, the averaged mse values over both regression methods vary considerably among the inhibitor classes .

influence of dataset size on performance of structure-based models
using inhibitor datasets that contain significantly fewer mutants, our prediction accuracies are generally comparable to those of the sequence-based method in rhee et al.  <cit> , suggesting that our structure-based attributes encode a greater degree of information content. averaged over all  <dig> inhibitors common to both studies, our datasets combined consist of fewer than half  the number of mutants used by the stanford group, with a maximum of  <dig> % for the pi amprenavir and a minimum of  <dig> % for the nrti abacavir.

to better understand the influence of dataset size on model performance, we generated learning curves  by using the tsm attribute datasets and selecting one representative drug from each inhibitor class: ritonavir for the pis, stavudine for the nrtis, and nevirapine for the nnrtis. the plots evaluate all four learning methods and were generated by initially applying tenfold cross-validation  testing to each of  <dig> stratified random samples of  <dig> mutants  selected with replacement from their respective inhibitor datasets. after calculating mean 10-fold cv performance measures, subsequent iterations were carried out which involved incrementing by  <dig> mutants  the sizes of the sampled subsets. the learning curves of figure  <dig> suggest that sample sizes significantly affect the performance of the statistical learning methods, a result similar to one reported in rhee et al.  <cit> .

structure-based prediction of paired hiv- <dig> rt drug effects
the reported classification and regression summary data support the finding that tsm attribute datasets consistently outperform the all and ias datasets in predicting mutant hiv- <dig> pr or rt susceptibility to inhibitors, albeit marginally in some cases. similar trends were reported by the stanford group, where they reasonably postulated that prediction success using tsms emerged from selective pressure on hiv- <dig> to escape drug inhibition  <cit> . successful haart regimens either target hiv- <dig> on multiple fronts , or they consist of medications that display non-overlapping mutational patterns of cross-resistance . specifically, many cocktails include a pair of nrtis that display incongruent patterns of selective mutational pressure across the tsm positions for the class, and these are typically combined with an nnrti   <cit> . in addition to the potential for cross-resistance, serious factors that may preclude the pairing of certain drugs include antagonism, toxicity, and reduced efficacy.

an application of our structure-based approach facilitates the identification of potentially effective drug combinations targeting hiv- <dig> rt. first, we represent the rt mutants comprising each of the nrti and nnrti inhibitor datasets as feature vectors consisting of ec score attributes at all  <dig> combined tsm residue positions associated with both inhibitor classes . next, we select one inhibitor dataset of rt mutants to train a reptree regression model, and testing is performed on another dataset. all possible pairs of datasets are used as training/testing combinations, and we report the correlation coefficients  between the actual and predicted relative susceptibility levels of the mutants in each test set; in cases where the same inhibitor is used for training and testing, the results reflect the resubstitution error for that dataset . positive values of r →  <dig> suggest a greater likelihood of 1) similar mutant susceptibility profiles and consequent cross-resistance between the inhibitors representing the training/test set pair; or 2) increased antagonism and toxicity, or reduced efficacy with respect to concomitant administration of both drugs. on the other hand, effective drug combinations are more likely to be associated with training/test set pairs that yield insignificant  or negative correlations.

given the interpretations outlined above, the data in table  <dig> reflect both the historical spectrum of clinically prescribed drug cocktails as well as the currently recommended treatment guidelines  <cit> . our complementary sequence-based  models yield a similar table of correlations published in a recent report  <cit> , where a subsequent discussion detailing specifically how those data mirror the treatment guidelines also applies here to the structure-based results of table  <dig> 

sequence-based classification and regression summaries
as fully described in our companion study  <cit> , the hiv- <dig> pr and rt mutants comprising the  <dig> inhibitor-specific datasets are represented as feature vectors of sequence-based input attributes through two types of n-grams applications, referred to as the relative frequency and the counts methods, and these datasets are used in conjunction with two statistical learning algorithms . our sequence-based results  are in line with those of both our structure-based models as well as the sequence-based models of the stanford group with respect to the pi and nnrti classes, and similar to what was observed with our structure-based models, this n-grams approach ranks lamivudine second to emtricitabine in mean accuracy among the nrtis. a minor discrepancy is observed, whereby our sequence-based models rank tenofovir second lowest in mean accuracy compared to abacavir among the nrtis, while both our structure-based models and the sequence-based models of the stanford group have these rankings inverted. additional performance data for our sequence-based models and a detailed analysis of all results are provided in the aforementioned report.

sequence contribution to n-grams prediction
as shown in  <cit> , we examine attributes selected at reptree nodes for our sequence-based models in order to identify the most information-rich hiv- <dig> pr and rt residue positions used by those regression trees, thereby leading to their predictive capability. for each inhibitor-specific model, table  <dig>  summarizes the attributes selected for the root node  as well as for nodes at the next two levels, where an attribute i corresponds to both sequence positions i and i +  <dig> in either pr or rt based on the relative frequency n-grams approach . note that all root node attributes correspond to sequence positions that appear in both the ias and tsm drug resistance mutation sets, while the majority  of attributes at the next two levels of nodes correspond to positions that either also overlap both sets or appear exclusively in the tsm subsets.

CONCLUSIONS
we developed accurate and efficient statistical learning models, based on innovative approaches using structure and sequence, for systematically relating residue replacements in hiv- <dig> pr and rt target enzymes  to quantified changes in susceptibility to each of  <dig> antiretroviral drugs . the models were trained using datasets of previously assayed mutants with known phenotypes that were made available from the stanford university hiv drug resistance database  <cit> . for the structure-based models, mutant pr or rt proteins were represented as feature vectors whose input attributes, obtained via an in silico mutagenesis technique relying on a four-body statistical potential energy function, quantified environmental perturbations at positions in their respective targets upon mutation . similarly, we developed sequence-based models by generating mutant attributes through two applications of n-grams, a technique previously used by other groups in a variety of studies on proteins  <cit>  though not in this particular realm. our models display performance measures that are generally competitive with those described by rhee et al.  <cit>  in their seminal systematic study that utilizes a sequence-based approach. the structure-based  methods reported here represent prediction strategies that are orthogonal  to those of rhee et al., and both studies employ non-overlapping, information-rich attributes. in a novel application, our models were used to classify all pairs of rt inhibitors as either potentially effective as part of an antiretroviral cocktail, or a combination that should not be concomitantly administered.
