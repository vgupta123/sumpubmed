BACKGROUND
protein acetylation adds the acetyl group on either the amino-terminal residues or on the epsilon-amino group of lysine residues. lysine acetylation affects many protein functions, including dna binding, protein-protein interactions, and protein stability. tip <dig> catalyzes histone acetylation  <cit> . it was originally identified as a cellular acetyltransferase protein that interacts with hiv- <dig> tat  <cit> . over-expression of tip <dig> increased tat transactivation of the hiv- <dig> promoter  <cit> . recent studies found that tip <dig> has diverse functions involved in transcription, cellular signaling, dna damage repair, cell cycle checkpoint control and apoptosis  <cit> .

salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  causes gastrointestinal diseases in humans and typhoid-like fever in the mouse. s. typhimurium encodes two type iii secretion systems within the salmonella pathogenicity islands  <dig> and  <dig>  that are required for salmonella entry and subsequent survival inside the host cells, respectively  <cit> . following entry into the host cells, s. typhimurium replicates within a membrane-bound compartment termed salmonella-containing vacuole . previous studies have shown that sifa, ssef and sseg are involved in the formation of salmonella induced filaments  that are required for maintaining the scv  <cit> .

ssef, working together with sseg, has been shown to be involved in the aggregation of host endosomes and may help to position the salmonella-containing vacuoles in close association with the golgi network  <cit> . in the absence of ssef, the vacuolar compartments containing salmonella were discontinuous and intracellular salmonella replication was reduced  <cit> . sseg was shown to be co-localized with the trans-golgi network and only bacteria closely associated with the golgi network were able to multiply  <cit> . it has been shown that ssef interacts functionally and physically with sseg but not sifa and is also required for the perinuclear localization of salmonella vacuoles  <cit> . the molecular mechanism on how ssef and sseg function remains unknown. in the present study, we set out to search the host target that interacts with ssef. we presented evidence indicating that salmonella ssef interacts with tip <dig> to potentiate its histone acetylation activity to promote intracellular replication.

s. typhimurium and e. coli

plasmids
mammalian cell lines and bacterial infection assay
the murine macrophage raw <dig>   and the human epithelial cell line hela  were from the atcc  and were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle medium  containing 10% fbs. bacterial infection of raw <dig>  and survival assays were carried out using opsonized bacteria in dmem containing 10% normal mouse serum as described before  <cit> . the extent of replication was then determined by dividing the number of intracellular bacteria at twenty-four hours by the number at two hours.

yeast two-hybrid screening
the gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used following standard procedures  <cit> . the bait plasmid  was constructed by deleting the putative three trans-membrane regions  of ssef and fusing it to the yeast gal <dig> binding domain in pgbt <dig> m  <cit> . a human cell cdna library was constructed by oligo priming in pact <dig> . a total of  <dig> ×  <dig> transformants were screened in the yeast indicator strain ah <dig>  using the sequential transformation protocol as described . clones that grow on the yeast synthetic drop-out media lacking histidine and exhibited positive galactosidase on the x-gal plates were chosen for further analysis.

protein purification and biochemical pull down assay
gst, his and mbp-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed and purified in escherichia coli bl <dig>  using the pgex-kg, pet28a, or the pmal-c2x expression systems, respectively. the purification of the gst-tagged proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions . purified proteins were concentrated and buffer exchanged in pbs, using a  <dig> k and  <dig> k molecular weight cut-off dialysis cassette . purified proteins were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°c in pbs/20% glycerol. proteins were pre-clarified at  <dig>  xg, and their concentration was determined by bradford assay  using bovine serum albumin as standard. pulled-down proteins were analyzed by sds-page and western blotting using appropriate antibodies. western blots were developed with using the supersignal west pico detection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions .

hat assay
hat assays were performed using recombinant mbp-tip <dig> protein  as acetyltransferase and histone  as the substrate in  <dig> μl hat buffer  containing acetyl-coa  for  <dig> min at 30°c. acetylated histones were detected by western blot, using the pan-acetyl antibody .

tip <dig> sirna
tip <dig> sirna expression plasmids were constructed in psilencer  <dig>   with a pair of 63-bp oligonucleotides, each containing a unique 19-bp tip <dig> sequence. for use in human cell lines: 5'-gatccgaacaagagttaattcccagttc aagagactgggaataactcttgttcttttttggaaa-3' and 5'-agcttttccaaaaaa gaacaagagttattcccagtctcttgaactgggaataactcttgttcg-3'. for use in mouse cell lines: 5'-gatccagactggagcaagagaggattcaagagatcctctcttgc tccagtctttttttggaaa-3' and 5'-agcttttccaaaaaaagactggagcaagag aggatctcttgaatcctctcttgctccagtctg-3'. for negative control, a scrambled sirna hairpin was placed into the same sites in psilencer  <dig> . these plasmids were transfected into cells using the siport xp- <dig> provided by ambion. transfected cells were maintained for  <dig> hours without selection; cultures were then subjected to g <dig> selection before infection.

RESULTS
salmonella spi <dig> effector protein ssef interacts with tip <dig> histone acetylase
in a search for host proteins that interact with ssef, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screening  <cit>  of a human cell cdna library, using a fusion of the dna-binding domain of gal <dig> and the truncated ssef devoid of transmembrane regions  as the bait. one clone was identified which encodes the c-terminal 164- <dig> tip <dig> histone acetyltransferase isoform  <dig> . there are at least three splice variants of tip60: tip <dig> isoform  <dig> , tip <dig> isoform  <dig> , and tip <dig> isoform  <dig> . itip <dig> retains the alternatively spliced intron  <dig>  <cit> . tip60β lacks exon  <dig>  <cit> . different isoforms potentially involve distinct functions in the cells. when tested in the yeast two-hybrid, all three tip <dig> isoforms interacted with gal4bd-ssef chimerical protein . to determine the region of ssef that is responsible for interacting with tip <dig>  a series of ssef deletions was constructed and tested in the yeast two-hybrid for their ability to interact with tip <dig>  we found that amino acids 50- <dig> were sufficient for mediating the ssef and tip <dig> interaction . we observed weak interactions occasionally when confirming the interactions biochemically using purified recombinant proteins. this is not unusual as most wild-type enzymes do not interact strongly with their target molecules. it is also possible that the three putative transmembrane regions in ssef are essential for tight interactions and the fragment devoid of the transmembrane regions has reduced affinity rendering it difficult to detecting the interactions in vitro.

ssef increases the histone acetylation activity of tip60
tip <dig> is a multifunctional acetyltransferase involved in many transcriptional regulations by serving as a co-regulator  <cit> . the interaction of ssef with tip <dig> suggested that ssef may serve as the substrate for tip60-mediated acetylation. to test whether ssef serves as the substrate for tip <dig>  an in vitro hat assay was conducted, using purified recombinant mbp-tip <dig> as acetyltransferase and gst-ssef1- <dig> as the substrate  <cit> . when probed with antibodies specific for acetylated species, adducts were detected when histone was added to the reaction in the presence of mbp-tip <dig> . no ssef acetylation was observed when gst-ssef1- <dig> was used in the reaction. similar results were obtained when partially enriched full-length ssef was used in the reaction . thus, ssef is not likely the substrate for tip <dig> 

since ssef is not likely the substrate for tip <dig>  we explored the possibility that ssef-tip <dig> interaction may alter the acetylation activity of tip <dig> without direct modification. we then examined whether gst-ssef1- <dig> affected tip60-mediated histone acetylation, using the in vitro hat assay with recombinant mbp-tip <dig> as the acetyltransferase and histone as the substrate in the presence of gst-ssef1- <dig> or gst. we observed an increase in the amount of acetylated histone h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> when gst-ssef1- <dig> was added to the reaction while addition of gst had no obvious effect . the increase is more pronounced for the histone isoform h <dig> and more moderate for isoforms h <dig> and h <dig>   <cit> . we next explored whether the full-length ssef has similar effect as the gst-ssef1- <dig> to histone acetylation. we previously showed that sscb is the chaperone for ssef and that they interact with each other  <cit> . we obtained ssef-m <dig> by co-expressing ssef and sscb followed by pulling down his-sscb. the enriched ssef-m <dig> was then used in the in vitro hat assay as described above. again, we observed increased tip60-mediated histone h <dig> acetylation in the presence of ssef-m <dig> . similar enhancement of tip60-mediated histone h <dig> acetylation was noted when enriched his-ssef was used in the hat assay . no obvious change in tip60-mediated histone acetylation was found when his-sseg was used in the same reaction . taken together, we conclude that ssef can potentiate the histone h <dig> acetylation activity of tip <dig> 

tip <dig> protein level is increased upon salmonella infection
tip <dig> is known to be involved in diverse functions and the endogenous basal level of tip <dig> is usually low. tip <dig> level increases significantly upon uv irradiation  <cit> . upon salmonella infection of hela cells, we observed an increase in tip <dig> as short as  <dig> minutes after infection and approaching maximum induction three hours post infection . actin levels in the same samples remained constant up to  <dig> hours after infection. this supports the notion that tip <dig> might play an important role during salmonella infection. this increase is ssef-independent, as similar increase was also observed when infected with an ssef mutant salmonella strain and tip <dig> was not concentrated at the vacuoles . ssef was not detected in infected cells possibly due to the low amounts translocated during salmonella infections.

tip <dig> is required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication
previous studies have shown that ssef is required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication in macrophages  <cit> . since tip <dig> acetyltransferase interacts with ssef, tip <dig> might be required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication. to test this, we used sirna to down-regulate the endogenous level of tip <dig>  macrophages were transfected with a plasmid expressing tip <dig> sirna or a control vector expressing the scrambled sirna. as shown in fig.  <dig>  tip <dig> sirna effectively suppressed the endogenous tip <dig> expression, while the control sirna did not. transfected macrophages were infected with wild-type s. typhimurium or the ssef mutant strains. as shown in fig.  <dig>  down-regulation of tip <dig> leads to less efficient salmonella replication comparable to the level of ssef mutant strain  <cit> . there was not significant replication change in cells expressing the scrambled sirna. these data support our notion that tip <dig> is required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication in macrophages.

discussion
we do not know yet the molecular mechanism of how ssef and tip <dig> interaction affects the scv and intracellular salmonella replication. ideally, a mutant ssef lacking the tip60-binding domain can be used to assess the requirement for ssef-tip <dig> interaction for its function, however such a mutant is defective in secretion and thus not translocated, making it impossible to assess its effect during infection. definitive identification of the acetylation site and subsequent characterization of proper mutants lacking tip60-mediated acetylation will be required to validate this hypothesis. alternatively, ssef-tip <dig> interaction may alter the acetylation activity of tip <dig>  thus affecting tip <dig> related functions. supporting this hypothesis, our preliminary in vitro acetylation assays suggest that ssef increased the histone acetylation activity of tip <dig>  especially for histone h <dig>  histone is the only known substrate for tip <dig>  total histone acetylation was not increased in infected cells . this is consistent with the low amount of ssef translocated. it is possible that local ssef concentration may be higher in infected cells.

although tip <dig> is not known to be directly involved in vesicle trafficking, it is possible that tip <dig> affected histone acetylation leading to altered expression of trafficking-related proteins. interestingly, our preliminary data showed that knock down of tip <dig> reduced continuous sif formation, a phenotype similar to that of the ssef null mutant . future experiments are required to determine whether the increase in histone acetylation leads to increases in tip60-mediated downstream functions. this may ultimately help us to understand how ssef interact with tip <dig> to promote salmonella replication inside the host cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that tip <dig>  an acetyltransferase, interacts with salmonella ssef. we further showed that the tip <dig> acetylation activity was increased in the presence of ssef, and tip <dig> was upregulated upon salmonella infection. more importantly, tip <dig> is required for efficient intracellular salmonella replication in macrophages. our study demonstrated that salmonella may use ssef to exploit the host tip <dig> acetyltransferase activity to promote efficient salmonella replication inside host cells.
