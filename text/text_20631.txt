BACKGROUND
the periplasmic binding proteins  are a protein superfamily that serve as primary receptors for a diverse group of metabolic solutes in signaling  <cit> , chemotaxis  <cit>  and metabolite transport systems in bacteria  <cit> , eukaryotes and archaea. pbp mediated transmembrane transport of ligands are coupled to either atp hydrolysis   <cit>  or h+/m+ motive force   <cit> . in addition, the pbp module is also found in enzymes  <cit> , transcriptional control elements  <cit>  and eukaryotic neurotransmission systems  <cit> . pbps bind multiple ligands that range in size from a few daltons to as large as  <dig> kda, including ions  <cit> , amino acids  <cit> , peptides  <cit> , monosaccharides  <cit> , oligosaccharides  <cit> , polyamines  <cit> , oxidized inorganics  <cit> . many other ligands continue to be discovered through current genome sequencing technology  <cit> .

despite the wide variation in pbp cognate ligand size and chemical functionality, the three-dimensional structure is highly conserved across all pbps. pbps are comprised of two α/β domains connected by a flexible linker region that serves as a pivot point for the ligand induced hinge-bending motion that this protein superfamily is known for  <cit> . pbps were initially classified into three distinct sub-groups based upon the topology of β-strands in each domain  <cit> . recently, the pbp super-family was re-categorized into six distinct clusters by combining known ligand specificities with the wealth of structural information available in the protein data bank  <cit> .

pbps typically bind cognate ligands with exquisite specificity, discriminating among anomeric/epimeric carbohydrates or different ions  <cit> . this remarkable ability to specifically bind their cognate ligands from pools of similarly related molecules has been attributed to the localization of the pbp ligand binding site at the interdomain interface  <cit> . in the apo form, ligand binds to a highly adaptable solvent exposed surface which upon complexation with ligand, and the other pbp domain, produces an environment similar to a less adaptable solvent excluded protein core  <cit> . in most cases pbp function relies on differential recognition of the apo and ligand bound forms of the protein by transmembrane-bound proteins  <cit> . ligand binding at the interdomain interface stimulates a conformational change which is characterized as a rigid body hinge-bending/twisting motion about the interdomain linker region. the relative orientation of the two domains changes by as much as 60-70°  <cit> , although the magnitude of the hinge-bending motion is variable and can be rather small in some cases  <cit> . the conformational coupling of ligand binding and function is also conserved when the pbp module is found in larger multidomain proteins, such as the eukaryotic glutamate receptor  <cit>  and the laci family of transcriptional regulators  <cit> .

this pbp ligand binding paradigm was recently altered when the crystal structure of the thermotoga maritima cellobiose binding protein  was solved  <cit> . unlike other pbps, the tmcbp binding site is bipartite, being composed of a typical pbp solvent excluded disaccharide binding site  that is adjacent to an atypical large solvent filled cavity  where three additional saccharide rings could be placed . the structure of tmcbp was solved in the presence of β linked sugars, however the size of the tmcbp binding cavity and molecular modeling suggested additional glucan sugar linkages could be accommodated in both the disaccharide binding site and the solvent filled cavity . tmcbp is found in an operon that consists of an abc transport system and an endoglucanase, the natural substrate of which has been predicted to be the algae-based storage polysaccharide laminarin  <cit> . using a series of laminarin-based β linked carbohydrates we sought to further identify the molecular mechanisms underlying simultaneous encoding of specificity and promiscuity in tmcbp subsites. these studies suggests ways that the bound hydrogen bonding rich water molecules bound in subsite two can potentially be used to adapt and expand ligand binding sites beyond the functionality encoded by the fixed protein scaffold.

RESULTS
thermal stability and ligand binding specificity of tmcbp
previous molecular modeling of the tmcbp binding  <cit>  site suggested that in addition to β oligosaccharides, additional linkages such as β carbohydrates or mixed β/β could be accommodated in the bipartite binding site . thermal denaturation of tmcbp, monitored by the change in circular dichroism  signal, was used to assess the binding of the xylan-based β linked xylose pentasaccharide, xylopentaose, and the laminarin-based β linked glucose disaccharide, laminaribiose , and pentasaccharide, laminaripentaose . to bring the thermal melting point  into a measurable range, experiments were carried out in the presence of the chemical denaturant guanidine hydrochloride at a concentration of  <dig> m  <cit> . addition of lr <dig> and lr <dig> shifted the tm of the protein from  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c respectively . these studies indicate that the tmcbp binding site accommodates β glucosaccharides ranging in size from two to five sugar rings, which is consistent with earlier cd binding studies for the β glucosaccharides cellobiose and cellopentaose  <cit> . unexpectedly, the β linked xylose-based sugar, xylopentaose, did not induce a change in the tm indicating a lack of a stabilizing or binding interaction with tmcbp . in the previous molecular modeling of the tmcbp binding site, the first sugar ring of either the β or β glucosaccharides, and in-turn the c <dig> hydroxyl, is coincident among the two ligand bound forms . it is likely that the hydrogen bonding interactions of the carbohydrate ring c <dig> hydroxyl with the protein are important for the discrimination of xylo- and glucosaccharides, as the xylosaccharides lack the c <dig> carbon and hydroxyl atoms.

solution structure of apo and ligand-bound tmcbp
in order to characterize the conformational changes induced upon addition of ligand, small-angle neutron scattering  data was used to characterize both the apo and ligand bound forms of tmcbp. cellobiose was used for these studies, which based on the previous crystal structures produces a closed state essentially identical to the laminarin-based carbohydrates. comparison of the apo and ligand-bound curves show significant differences in both the high q and low q data, indicative of a ligand induced conformational change . these raw data can be transformed into a kratky plot where geometrical differences, such as compactness and flexibility, in the scattering particles can be highlighted. in the case of a multi-domain protein connected by flexible linkers, the kratky plot would show a broad peak at lower q-values, with an upturn at the higher q-values. the krakty plots for the apo and cellobiose-bound protein are similar in shape and indicative of a globular protein rather than two domains connected by a flexible linker . this suggests that the tmcbp hinge does not allow for significant conformational flexibility in the absence of ligand which is consistent with the previous small-angle scattering studies of the group ii maltose binding protein  <cit> . it is interesting to speculate as to whether the flexibility of the pbp hinge may be inherent to a particular pbp group as structures of group i pbps in the absence of ligand have been shown to adopt a series of domain closure angles, perhaps suggesting flexibility in the absence of ligand  <cit> .

upon addition of ligand the protein undergoes large scale conformational changes as evidenced in the decrease in the radius of gyration and dmax . the large differences in these biophysical parameters of the scattering particles are of a greater magnitude than one would expect based upon previous small-angle scattering studies of other group ii pbps  <cit> . molecular weight determination, based upon the intensity at zero scattering angle suggests that the apo protein forms inter-protein associations that are alleviated upon addition of cellobiose . inter-protein associations have previously been reported for this protein superfamily  <cit> . no molecular modeling of the apo protein was carried out. the sans data of the cellobiose-bound protein is well accounted for by the previously determined cellobiose-bound tmcbp crystal structure . this is also observed in comparison of the cellobiose-bound crystal structure and the ab-initio model generated from the sans data in the presence of  <dig> mm cellobiose .

an extensive network of polar and non-polar amino acids and water molecules bind the lr <dig> ligand . a ligplot+ representation of the lr <dig> binding pocket is shown in additional file 1: figure s1a  <cit> . as in other periplasmic carbohydrate binding proteins, a network of aromatic amino acids envelops the ligand between the n- and c-terminal domains. a total of six tryptophan residues  form van der waals interactions with the two sugar rings. in total, ten hydrogen bonds can be formed with the first sugar ring. two hydrogen bonds are formed with the c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyl each, whereas the c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyls form three hydrogen bonds each. all but one hydrogen bond are directly formed with the protein, with the c <dig> hydroxyl being ligated by a single specifically bound water molecule, w <dig>  for second sugar ring of the laminaribiose, only the c <dig> hydroxyl forms a direct hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of gly <dig>  which also forms a hydrogen bond with the c <dig> hydroxyl of the first ring. the other six hydrogen bonds with the second ring are with water molecules. the c <dig> hydroxyl of second ring forms hydrogen bonds with specifically bound water molecules, w <dig> and w <dig>  whereas the c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyls form hydrogen bonds with w <dig> and w <dig> water molecules. c <dig> hydroxyl also forms hydrogen bonds with w <dig>  which forms another hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of ala <dig>  the o <dig> hemiacetal oxygen of second ring forms a hydrogen bond with another water molecule, w <dig> .

unlike the other tmcbp structures that have been solved thus far, both the lr <dig> complex and the lr <dig> complex contain a pentagonal bipyrimidally-bound calcium ion . this calcium ion was bound from the crystallization precipitant solution that contained calcium acetate. the carbonyl of tyr <dig>  the side-chain gln <dig>  and the main carbonyl and side chain carboxylate of asp <dig> fill four of the seven coordination sites, while the remainders are filled by a network of specifically bound water molecules .

crystal structure of laminaripentaose complex
the crystal structure of tmcbp complexed with laminaripentaose  was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement using the previously determined tmcbp structure  <cit>  . this structure was refined to rwork and rfree values of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the final model consists of  <dig> amino acids, a laminaripentaose molecule, and  <dig> water molecules. a calcium ion is also bound in an identical manner as the lr <dig> complex. the overall fold of the protein is similar to the structure of the cellopentaose complexed protein . data collection, stereochemistry and refinement statistics are summarized in table  <dig> 

like the lr <dig> complex, an extensive network of polar and non-polar amino acids and water molecules also bind the lr <dig> ligand . a ligplot+ representation of the lr <dig> binding pocket is shown in additional file 1: figure s1a  <cit> . the first and second lr <dig> sugar rings are bound in an identical manner as the lr <dig> sugar rings. however, the o <dig> hemiacetal oxygen of the second lr <dig> sugar ring forms an intra-molecular interaction with the third sugar ring c <dig> hydroxyl, which replaces the water molecule w <dig> of lr <dig>  all the hydroxyls of ring  <dig> of lr <dig> have only water mediated hydrogen bonds. the c <dig> hydroxyl and the lr <dig> ring 3/ <dig> hemiacetal each form two hydrogen bonds with three water molecules, while c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyls form single hydrogen bond with w <dig> and w <dig>  respectively. unlike the ring three of lr <dig>  ring four forms direct hydrogen bonds with the protein. the c <dig> hydroxyl forms two hydrogen bonds, while the c <dig> hydroxyl and o <dig> oxygen each form a single hydrogen bond with the protein. an additional water molecule, w <dig>  hydrogen bonds with the c <dig> hydroxyl of the lr <dig> ring  <dig>  the c <dig> hydroxyl of the fifth lr <dig> ring forms two hydrogen bonds, while the c <dig> hydroxyl forms a single hydrogen bond with the protein. three specifically bound water molecules hydrogen bond with the c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> hydroxyls; two of these waters also separately hydrogen bond with the ring 4/ <dig> o <dig> hemiacetal oxygen and the o <dig> oxygen of ring  <dig>  ring  <dig> is essentially occupying the positions of w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> of lr <dig> complex while ring  <dig> replaces the w <dig> water of the lr <dig> complex.

the calcium ion of the lr <dig> complex , with slight variation in coordination distances, has identical coordination geometry as the calcium ion present in the lr <dig> structure. it is interesting to note that the asp <dig>  which primarily coordinates the calcium ion also forms hydrogen bonds to c <dig> hydroxyl of lr <dig> ring  <dig> and a water molecule that hydrogen bonds to the c <dig> hydroxyl of the fifth sugar ring . moreover, the side chain of gln <dig>  of which the main chain carbonyl interacts with a water molecule that coordinates with the calcium ion, also forms two hydrogen bonds with the c <dig> hydroxyl of the lr <dig> ring four. the localization of this calcium ion suggests it may potentially have a functional role in ligand binding, rather than a structural role as found in other pbps  <cit> .

comparison of laminarin and cellodextrin bound structures
comparison of the laminarin and cellodextrin bound tmcbp structures allow for the identification of the molecular details of ligand selectivity in this semi-specific periplasmic binding protein. superposition of the laminaripentaose  and cellopentaose  complexes demonstrates that the conformation of almost every amino acid that forms van der waals interactions or hydrogen bonds with the lr <dig> or cp <dig> in both subsites is in an identical conformation . a single amino acid in subsite two, gln <dig>  adopts an alternate rotamer between the two structures. as the ligands occupy distinct regions of the binding pocket, which remain fixed in position regardless of which ligand is bound, we postulate that the identical conformation of the hydrogen bonding and van der waals ligand interaction network suggests the protein binding pocket is pre-ordered for binding of either ligand.

role of water molecules in organizing the tmcbp binding site
the tmcbp binding site accommodates both β and β carbohydrates by utilizing the non-specific, subsite two, binding site  <cit> . although the ligands occupy different regions of the non-specific subsite, there is significant overlap of the amino acids involved in the recognition of either ligand. we sought to understand how this occurs when the protein amino acid network remains in a fixed conformation. superposition of the lr <dig> and cp <dig> bound structures suggest the bound water network may play an important role in the plasticity of the tmcbp binding site . five distinct classes of water molecules that are specifically bound to either the n or c-terminal domain are found potentially mediating and modulating ligand selectivity in the tmcbp ligand binding site.

 <dig>  waters in identical positions coordinating identical atoms on different ligands : the first lr <dig> and cp <dig> sugar rings are in identical positions and the water molecule coordinating the c <dig> hydroxyl is also found in an identical position. this water simultaneously forms hydrogen bonds with both the n and c-terminal domains of the protein, the c <dig> hydroxyl of the ligand, and another bound water molecule that interacts with the second sugar ring. as five membered β-xylan carbohydrates do not bind to tmcbp it is possible that the positioning and the bonding network of this water molecule make it important in transducing to the protein that a six membered ring is bound in subsite one. the combination of the lack of this water molecule, and the lacking of the molecular interactions with the c <dig> carbon and hydroxyl group, potentially impede formation of the closed ligand bound state of the protein in the presence of xylans. these types of bridging, ligand-binding-induced interdomain contacts have been postulated to be important in stimulating the pbp conformational change  <cit> .

 <dig>  waters in identical positions coordinating different ligand atoms : beyond the first sugar ring, the conformation or localization of the sugars in the binding pocket significantly differ. although coordinating distinct ligand atoms which are located in different regions of subsite two, several water molecules are found conserved in the lr <dig> and cp <dig> bound structures. water molecules that hydrogen bond with ring  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> of the lr <dig> ligand are also found in the cp <dig> bound structure. the conservation of water molecules is also observed in the water molecules interacting with ring  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> of the cp <dig> ligand. the rich hydrogen bonding potential of water molecules allows for conservation of water position in both the cp <dig> and lr <dig> forms and thereby potentially permits the preordering of the hydrogen bonding potential of subsite one for either type of ligand.

 <dig>  waters in identical positions forming ligand contacts in one form and not the other : beyond the first two sugar rings found in subsite one, the localization of the lr <dig> and the cp <dig> in the tmcbp subsite two differ significantly. however, several water molecules that are involved in forming hydrogen bonds with lr <dig> are still present when cp <dig> is bound in subsite two. the same is also true for subsite two waters that hydrogen bond with cp <dig> and not lr <dig>  this class of water molecule is involved in pre-ordering the rotameric state of subsite two hydrogen bonding residues. although crystal structure of apo form of tmcbp protein could not be obtained, it is possible the same water-mediated hydrogen bonding network pre-orders subsite  <dig> for binding of β or β ligands in the apo state.

 <dig>  waters that mimic hydroxyls/hemiacetals of other ligand : several water molecules are present in either the lr <dig> or cp <dig> bound structure that mimic the localization in subsite two of ligand hydroxyl groups of the other ligand. similar to the class  <dig> water molecules, this class of water molecules preforms both the water and protein hydrogen bonding interactions for either ligand, the role of which is potentially important for promiscuous ligand recognition of the apo protein.

 <dig>  secondary shell waters involved in coordinating primary shell waters : beyond the primary shell water molecules that directly interact with the ligands, a conserved network of at least twelve water molecules is found ordering either the primary shell waters or the amino acids that are involved in interacting with the ligands.

CONCLUSIONS
depending on biological function, pbps ligand selectivity is modulated through a combination of binding pocket adaptations that mediate ligand positioning, alter ligand size selection, or alter the free energy of ligand binding in such a manner that excludes incorrect ligands  <cit> . the novel bipartite tmcbp binding site represents an additional, interesting alteration of pbp ligand recognition, exemplifying how both specificity and promiscuity are encoded in a single binding site. comparison of the tmcbp structures bound to laminarin-based and cellodextrin-based carbohydrates allows for identification of the novel binding selectivity determinants found in this binding site.

the structural changes accompanying ligand binding in pbps typically involves a re-organization of side-chain rotamers or the protein backbone. although in some cases one of the two binding half sites in each domain undergoes conformational changes upon ligand binding and this has been suggested as a mechanism of ordering ligand binding  <cit> . although lacking the apo crystal structure, analysis of the tmcbp ligand bound state suggests the binding site may be pre-ordered for binding of either laminarins or cellodextrins. essentially no structural differences are observed among the amino acids in the ligand recognition sphere of either class of ligands. it should be pointed out that no side-chain movement is observed even when the same residue forms direct or indirect interactions with either ligand.

the conservation and positioning of water molecules trapped in the tmcbp binding pocket suggest they potentially play a role in tuning tmcbp ligand selectivity. several classes of water molecules, playing distinct functional roles, are found in the tmcbp binding site. this network of water molecules preforms the ligand hydrogen bonding network and side chain conformations of ligand interacting amino acids, and thereby reduces the entropic penalty of ligand binding. additionally, these water molecules are rich in hydrogen bonding potential, allowing for conservation of water placement while facilitating the plasticity of this bipartite binding site.

the mode of ligand binding found in tmcbp represents an interesting adaptation mechanism not previously observed in other pbps. the downstream carbohydrate transport systems have a narrow, predefined limit to the size and type of carbohydrate that can be processed. the tmcbp binding cavity pre-filters this pool of ligands, potentially optimizing the transport process and in-turn eliminating the energetic penalty of presentation of incorrect carbohydrates to the transport machinery. in e. coli maltose binding protein ligands that do not fit within the binding site are still bound and presented to the transport machinery  <cit> . however, with tmcbp a single protein is used to promiscuously select a molecular class of ligands while at the same time sterically restricting the number of rings that can be placed within the constraints of the tmcbp binding cavity. larger ligands are likely not bound as they would impede the hinge bending motion and in-turn specific ligand recognition.

seven additional oligosaccharide binding proteins with varying substrate specificities are found in the t. maritima genome  <cit> . it remains to be observed whether the mode of ligand recognition in tmcbp is unique or found across this subset of periplasmic carbohydrate binding proteins. the adaptation mechanisms observed in tmcbp allow for expansion of binding site selectivity while maintaining specificity for a molecular class of ligands. these types of adaptation mechanisms could potentially be recapitulated in drug design studies where the rich hydrogen bonding potential of water molecules can be utilized to expand binding sites, or enable multiple drugs to bind to a single target site.
