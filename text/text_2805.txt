BACKGROUND
the mosquito aedes aegypti is the main dengue vector. one of the major problems concerning dengue transmission is that ae. aegypti eggs resist desiccation, surviving several months under dry conditions in a dormancy state at the end of their embryonic development  <cit> . an important component of the desiccation resistance is the serosal cuticle , a layer covering the embryo that is synthesized at early embryogenesis  <cit>  . the serosal cuticle is secreted by the serosa, a membrane formed by extra-embryonic cells that surrounds the whole embryo of many insects  <cit> . upon oviposition, the mosquito eggshell is composed of two layers, a compound exochorion and a smooth endochorion  <cit> . the sc develops during embryogenesis and becomes the third eggshell layer, lying beneath the endochorion  <cit> . it should be noted that the terminology of mosquito eggshell coverings, including the serosa and sc, is a matter of literary controversy. for example, telford  <cit>  designates the serosal cuticle as "vitelline membrane", beckel  <cit>  refers to the serosal cuticle as "transparent cuticle" while harwood  <cit>  and harwood and horsfall  <cit>  name the endochorion and serosal cuticle as "chorion" and "endochorion", respectively. we follow the revised nomenclature, described by clements  <cit>  and monnerat et al  <cit> . it is also important to emphasize that the serosal cuticle is not considered an "embryonic cuticle" per se, since it is secreted by the extraembryonic serosa cells and not by the embryo itself, as true embryonic cuticles  <cit> .

mosquito egg desiccation resistance is attributed to the serosal cuticle, which impedes water to escape from the embryo  <cit> . however, it was recently claimed that 2-hour old embryos or even oocytes are impermeable to water due to their covering layers  <cit> .

unlike the chorion, the sc is resistant to chlorine digestion, this being precisely the property employed to identify it  <cit> . although it was argued in the 1950's that mosquito sc contains chitin as one of its components  <cit> , conclusive evidence is still missing. moreover, the kinetics of sc secretion during embryogenesis is unknown.

chitin is a homo-amino-polysaccharide formed by β- <dig>  linked units of n-acetyl-d-glucosamine   <cit> . it is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature, present in fungi, nematodes and arthropods  <cit> . chitin synthase  is the enzyme responsible for the chitin polymer formation, using udp-glcnac as sugar donors  <cit> . in insects chitin is present in the exoskeleton as well as in the peritrophic matrix , and it is synthesized, respectively, by one of the two classes of chitin synthase genes, chs-a and chs-b  <cit> . insect chs-a genes have two mutually exclusive exons, resulting in two mrna spliced variants. both exons code for  <dig> amino acids comprising an extracellular, a transmembrane and an intracellular domain located near the carboxy terminus of the protein. the two spliced variants are expressed throughout tribolium castaneum and manduca sexta development  <cit> . the deletion of the drosophila melanogaster chs-a gene, named kkv, is embryonic lethal  <cit>  indicating a crucial role of this gene in development.

in opposition to the model system d. melanogaster, little is known about molecular mechanisms that control mosquito embryogenesis. although morphological movements are documented , papers describing some of the molecules associated with embryogenesis in mosquitoes are very recent  <cit> . lack of molecular studies with mosquito embryos is mainly due to the hard and impermeable nature of their eggshell, a characteristic that hampers fixation  <cit>  and internalization of probes. both procedures are necessary for in situ hybridization or immunostaining protocols, adopted for the investigation of gene expression profiles.

in summary, the eggshell of mosquitoes is a physical barrier for embryological studies, and the serosal cuticle, which is one of the eggshell constituents, is supposed to be important in ae. aegypti egg resistance to desiccation. we thus opted to better understand sc nature, physiological role and developmental kinetics in order to investigate its properties and relevance during mosquito embryonic development.

RESULTS
acquisition of desiccation resistance is associated to serosal cuticle formation
quantification of desiccation resistance, performed through air exposure of differently aged eggs , resulted in complete shrinkage of eggs up to  <dig> hae  . in contrast virtually all the eggs  <dig> hae or older remained intact . it should be note that in our conditions ae. aegypti total embryonic development takes  <dig>  hours at 28°c .

the serosal cuticle, but not mosquito chorion, is resistant to chlorine digestion  <cit> , and this approach was used to further evaluate  <dig> and  <dig> hae eggs . eleven hae eggs left in the chlorine solution  for 10– <dig> minutes start to disintegrate  and if left for a longer period  disintegrate completely, both eggshell and embryo . in contrast a  <dig> hae embryo exposed to bleach for  <dig> minutes remains intact and is clearly visible beneath the transparent serosal cuticle, after almost complete digestion of the chorion . taken together, these results indicate the sc is associated to desiccation resistance acquisition that abruptly appears between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after egglaying.

to evaluate the physiological relevance of desiccation resistance acquisition, we quantified the viability of developing eggs transferred to dry conditions at different ages and for varying periods of time, from  <dig> to  <dig> hours . no hatching was observed if eggs were exposed to dry conditions before sc formation . in contrast, samples dried at  <dig> hae were fully viable . intermediate values were obtained if eggs were transferred to dry conditions in a period close to sc formation . in this case viability was inversely proportional to the period of time spent in dry conditions. since  <dig> hours on dry, starting from  <dig> hae, corresponds to approximately  <dig> days after the end of embryogenesis, we conclude that the fully formed sc at  <dig> hae is competent to impede embryonic and larvae desiccation during and after completion of embryogenesis .

the serosal cuticle is formed at the moment of complete germ band extension
in order to determine the embryonic development stage related to sc formation, embryos were clarified as detailed in methods, item  <dig> . embryos at  <dig> hae exhibited the beginning of a morphological differentiation of the serosa anlage, immediately after the cellular blastoderm stage . this serosa anlage was also deduced in an. gambiae embryos from the expression of serosa specific genes  <cit>  . subsequently  germ band extension starts, and the serosa appears fully formed, completely surrounding the embryo . at  <dig> hae, the germ band extension is complete, as noted by the adjacent positions of the embryo head and its posterior end , and the serosal cuticle is being formed . at  <dig> hae the serosal cuticle is completely formed . the scheme in d' was deduced from the results shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig> .

chitin is present in the serosal cuticle
different methods were used to confirm the presence of chitin in mosquito sc, as previously stated by beckel  <cit>  and harwood  <cit> , see item  <dig> of methods. the first approach consisted of labeling with calcofluor white, a fluorescent molecule that binds β- <dig> -linked d-glycopyranoside units  <cit> . since some mosquito embryonic structures have autofluorescence  <cit> , controls were elaborated to confirm specific calcofluor labeling. figure  <dig> compares fluorescence of embryos before or after incubation with calcofluor. in both cases fluorescence images are shown either alone or together with dic microscopy. clarified 9-hae embryos incubated with calcofluor display a very faint fluorescence in serosal cells  whereas 15-hae embryos in the same conditions exhibit specific fluorescence in the sc . moreover, isolated serosal cuticle derived from fully developed embryos exhibit intense fluorescence . isolated scs were also submitted to staining with wga, a highly specific lectin for n-acetyl-d-glucosamine polymers  <cit> , showing uniform labeling .

finally, quantitation of chitin content of isolated scs was performed according to lehmann and white  <cit> . with this approach we detected  <dig>   ng of chitin, as corresponding glucosamine, for each isolated sc.

sequence and organization of the aachs <dig> gene
there are two chs genes in the ae. aegypti genome  <cit> , aachs <dig> and aachs <dig> . the latter, a class b chs gene, is associated with chitin production in the midgut  <cit> . specific primers could not detect expression of aachs <dig> during ae. aegypti embryogenesis 

before the release of the ae. aegypti genome  <cit> , degenerated primers designed to amplify a conserved region of dipteran chs-a genes were applied on ae. aegypti genomic dna to look for a putative aachs <dig> gene. an aachs <dig> fragment was obtained and employed to design specific primers that detected the presence of both aachs1a and aachs1b mrna in embryonic development . afterwards, using drosophila melanogaster kkv  sequence as the subject, the entire putative aachs <dig> was found in the ae. aegypti genome project. its deduced amino acid sequence was compared with an. gambiae chs-a  and dm_kkv, demonstrating a high degree of similarity among dipterans . the schematic representation of the genomic structure of aachs <dig> is shown in fig. 5a. the first intron contains an open reading frame similar to the pol-like mosqui-aa <dig> protein, a non-ltr retrotransposon element  <cit>  .

details of the aachs <dig> mutually exclusive exon 6a/6b organization, sequence and deduced transmembrane domains are displayed in fig. 5b–d. the aachs <dig> protein can be subdivided into three domains: an n-terminal region containing eight transmembrane domains, a central cytosolic region with the catalytic domain, characterized by the qrrrw chitin synthase signature motif  <cit> , and a c-terminal region containing seven additional transmembrane domains. five transmembrane domains of the c-terminal region are clustered together close to the catalytic domain whereas the two other transmembrane domains are located  <dig> amino acids downstream. both exons, 6a and 6b, translate  <dig> amino acids that encompass the penultimate transmembrane domain of the protein . the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 6a and 6b have 78% identity .

aachs <dig> mrna expression during embryonic development
messenger rna abundance in differently aged eggs was analyzed through qpcr with primers for aachs1a or aachs1b. embryos belonging to three groups, related both to the kinetics of desiccation resistance acquisition and sc formation, were evaluated before , during  and after  the abrupt desiccation resistance acquisition, exhibited in figure 1a. the aachs <dig> alternative spliced forms are differentially expressed during ae. aegypti embryogenesis . a slight expression of aachs1a is noted at  <dig> hae, increasing significantly up to  <dig> hae, a period that encompasses the complete serosa formation, at  <dig> hae , and the abrupt desiccation resistance acquisition . thus, aachs1a expression attains its higher rate of increase after the serosa has completely surrounded the embryo. this corresponds to the moment of serosal cuticle synthesis . in contrast, there is no aachs1b expression up to  <dig> hae, and its mrna is only slightly expressed at  <dig> hae, both isoforms being expressed at late embryogenesis, at  <dig> and  <dig> hae, respectively at the moments of dorsal closure and embryo organogenesis .

discussion
chitin synthesis in ae. aegypti embryogenesis
beckel  <cit>  and harwood  <cit>  have previously pointed to the presence of chitin in aedes sc. we have conclusively confirmed this issue through calcofluor and wga labeling and direct chitin quantitation. in a recent paper moreira et al conclude that a chitin-like material is present in eggshells right from oviposition  <cit> , possibly being part of the compound exochorion or the smooth endochorion  <cit> . as stated by moreira et al, their data "do not rule out a subsequent synthesis of chitin by serosa"  <cit>  which, according to the data presented here seems to be the case.

a fragment of the aachs <dig> genomic dna was sequenced, and the whole putative aachs <dig> gene  was subsequently obtained from ae. aegypti genome according to alignment of predicted amino acids with dipteran chs-a genes. chs-a orthologues from t. castaneum and m. sexta possess two splice variants  <cit> , these same variants being expressed during ae. aegypti embryogenesis. the difference between both is a region of  <dig> amino acids codified by different exons in each alternative mrna.

there is no experimental evidence regarding the specific use of any of the two transcripts. however, specific rnai for each of the two t. castaneum transcripts, tcchs1a and tcchs1b, display distinct phenotypes when dsrna specific for each transcript are injected into larval and pupal stages  <cit> . tcchs1b is required only during pupal-adult molt where its absence leads to death at this stage; tcchs1a is required both for larval-pupal and pupal-adult moults, its lack leading to death at both stages, indicating distinct roles for each transcript  <cit> . moreover, during both t. castaneum and m. sexta development the transcript containing the first alternative exon is far more expressed than the mrna with the second one  <cit> , a trend that was also observed during ae. aegypti embryogenesis, see below.

similar to the t. castaneum tcchs <dig> gene  <cit> , synthesis of ae. aegypti chs-b, aachs <dig>  <cit> , was not found during embryogenesis. accordingly, rnai experiments with t. castaneum larvae demonstrated that the chs-b tcchs <dig> gene is required only for peritrophic matrix chitin synthesis  <cit> .

the high increase of aachs1a expression at 9– <dig> hae is concomitant with the appearance of the chitinized sc , pointing out a specific role of aachs1a in chitin synthesis for the serosal cuticle by serosal cells, as indicated. it is highly unlikely that aachs1a early expression, from  <dig> until  <dig> hae, is related to larval cuticle chitin synthesis: 24-hour old embryos are at the germ band retraction stage , and cuticle formation starts later. raminani and cupp  <cit>  showed aedes aegypti larval cuticle production starts at 47–52% of development. accordingly, the later expression of both aachs1a and aachs1b at  <dig> hae occurs at 52% of the total embryogenesis time period. this late expression of both aachs1a and aachs1b, but not the early aachs1a expression, would have a role in organogenesis and larval cuticle synthesis, as described for d. melanogaster  <cit> . in this later species, dm_kkv  deletion is embryonic lethal  <cit> , and the expression of kkv is concomitant with chitin production for the larval cuticle  <cit> . these data suggest a crucial role of chs-a genes in dipteran embryogenesis. in d. melanogaster the gene kkv is expected to participate only in chitin synthesis of the larval cuticle, since cyclorrhapha flies do not have a serosa , therefore lacking a serosal cuticle.

serosa and the serosal cuticle role in insects
in insects, immediately after blastoderm formation, cells of the developing egg follow distinct fates, originating the embryonic  rudiment and the serosa anlage where the embryonic rudiment will form the embryo itself and the amnion  <cit> . the serosa originates from an anterior or anterodorsal portion of the egg  <cit> . following gastrulation the serosa completely envelopes the embryo and the yolk  <cit> . dipterans from nematocera and brachycera taxa also form separate amnion and serosa, with the exception of the cyclorrhapha  flies, such as musca  and drosophila , that do not form amnion and serosa, only a reminiscent amnioserosa  <cit> . it is argued that the serosa is important for developing insect embryos, protecting it against bacterial challenge  <cit>  or insecticides  <cit> . the absence of a functional serosa results in a complete everted  embryo as observed with rnai for tc-zen <dig> and of-zen in t. castaneum and o. fasciatus, respectively  <cit> . putative roles of serosa cells on yolk digestion  <cit>  or in embryonic excretion  <cit>  were also suggested.

in some mosquitoes, as in other insects , after enclosing the entire embryo the serosa secretes the serosal cuticle , a layer that is located above the serosa and below the endochorion  <cit> , see figure  <dig>  in aedes mosquitoes it has been previously shown that sc formation is related to egg desiccation resistance  <cit> . orthoptera, coleoptera and lepidoptera insects also possess a sc  <cit> , but its function in these insects is unknown. some findings indicate that in the coleoptera ocypus olens the serosal cuticle may function as a water barrier for developing embryos  <cit> . since the basal hexapoda clade archaeognatha also possesses a sc  <cit> , it can be inferred that this is a primitive trait in insects. taking this into account the absence of a serosa, and in consequence of a sc, would be a derived trait in cyclorrhapha flies such as d. melanogaster.

apart from its importance as the subject of study of the evolution of extra-embryonic membranes in insects  <cit> , the serosa possesses the seminal role in ae. aegypti of secreting the serosal cuticle. this layer is incriminated as important for desiccation resistance in aedes embryos and probably has a similar role in other mosquito genera as well. aedes eggs, when compared to other mosquito genera, can survive on dry for a much longer period of time  <cit> . we therefore speculate that sc contributes with different desiccation resistance levels in eggs from distinct culicidae genera. we are currently working to address the existence and role of sc in other mosquitoes species.

serosal cuticle formation and physiological role in ae. aegypti embryos
we have shown that the extra-embryonic serosa completely surrounds ae. aegypti embryos at the beginning of germ band extension, at  <dig> hae, followed by abrupt sc formation, between  <dig> and  <dig> hae. this 2-hour interval corresponds to only  <dig> % of total embryonic development.

the exposure of embryos to dry conditions for long periods before sc formation also results in complete blockage of hatching. by contrast, if the same procedure is performed after sc formation, all larvae are viable, even when embryos are left on dry from  <dig> to  <dig> hae . since after completion of embryogenesis the dormant larvae can resist many months on dry  <cit> , it should be argued that the observed rate of survival after  <dig> days on dry indicates that after  <dig> hae, a developing embryo is putatively able to survive also for many months on dry, as suggested before  <cit> . the data presented strongly argues in favor of an essential role of sc in protecting the developing embryo, and further the larvae, from desiccation. irrespective of a direct relationship between sc formation and desiccation resistance acquisition, early embryos are not resistant to desiccation neither water impermeable, as recently claimed  <cit> .

on the waterproofing nature of desiccation resistance
it is important to underlie that neither the sc nor the synthesized chitin from sc may be solely responsible for impermeability, where the serosal cuticle-endochorion bonding would be the functional unity that confers desiccation resistance  <cit> . additionally, it was claimed that a wax layer, as a part of the serosal cuticle, would be an important factor for desiccation resistance in ae. aegypti eggs  <cit> , in the same way wax is important for impermeability to the integument  of insects  <cit> . indeed, slifer  <cit>  observed two layers in the serosal cuticle of the grasshopper melanoplus differentialis: the "yellow cuticle", a thin externalmost layer secreted first and a thicker layer, so-called "white cuticle" lying beneath. chitin is present in the white cuticle and it was suggested that the yellow cuticle has wax in its composition  <cit> . in the hemiptera rhodnius prolixus, a wax layer is deposited around the embryo following serosa formation, insuring further resistance against desiccation  <cit> .

we thus propose that the final, mature desiccation resistance will be achieved by the interaction of proteins from the endochorion with proteins, lipids and sugars present in the serosal cuticle. these interactions could be orchestrated by the process of sclerotization  <cit> , which would be happening at the sc-endochorion bonding region. obviously these interactions would occur after the sc was shed, and could be responsible for the observed differences in the kinetics of events related to desiccation resistance here described.

in the case of culicidae embryonic development, the dynamics and the nature of the physiological processes that underlie eggshell impermeability acquisition are still poorly understood. additional experiments will be needed to functionally confirm the putative sc role on desiccation resistance, the role of sc-endochorion interactions in the impermeable status of mosquito eggs as well as the presence of a sc wax layer in ae. aegypti.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate the serosal cuticle is associated to ae. aegypti egg desiccation resistance acquisition, a phenomenon that abruptly develops between  <dig> and  <dig> hours after egglaying. it was also confirmed that, in addition to its known involvement in the peritrophic matrix and exoskeleton  <cit> , chitin is present in the serosal cuticle, as early suggested  <cit> . aedes aegypti has two chitin synthase genes, aachs <dig> and aachs <dig>  only the former being expressed during embryogenesis. aachs <dig> has two mutually exclusive exons, aachs1a and aachs1b, both expressed at late embryogenesis, probably participating in organogenesis and embryo exoskeleton formation. however, only aachs1a is transcribed during sc development, thus providing chitin for the sc structural backbone, where sc on its turn is involved with desiccation resistance, an important factor for the adaptative success of ae. aegypti, the dengue and urban yellow fever vector.
