BACKGROUND
teeth and tooth-like structures, together designated as odontodes, are thought to be serial homologs: they are repeated mineralized units composed of dentine and enamel, or enameloid, surrounding a pulp cavity . odontodes can be found in various locations on the body of extant gnathostomes, such as teeth in jaws and different bones in the oral and pharyngeal cavity, but also as dermal denticles  on the body surface in chondrichthyans  <cit> . teeth  contrast with denticles  in their ability to regenerate through a typical renewing process  <cit> . there has been a long and recently revitalized debate concerning the origin and evolution of odontodes. due to their mineralized composition, they are well preserved in the fossil record and a diversity of odontodes has been described in fossil and extant taxa belonging to gnathostomes: dermal denticles in thelodonts or heterostracans, pharyngeal denticles/teeth in thelodonts, ornaments on dermal bones of placoderms or coelacanths, or the earliest oral teeth described in placoderms  <cit> . more controversial are the pharyngeal denticles/teeth found in conodont animals that are currently considered to have diverged early from other vertebrates  <cit> . the long-held view  <cit>  that oral teeth first evolved by the co-option of dermal denticles at the oral margin when jaws evolved  has been challenged by reconsideration of these fossil data. because pharyngeal denticles may have arisen before oral teeth and because both structures share a common organization, smith and coates  <cit>  favoured a recruitment of the gene regulatory network  responsible for pharyngeal teeth development from the pharynx to the jaw in early gnathostomes . this model has been supported by morphological and molecular data gained in teleosts: pharyngeal tooth development has been compared to that of the mouse oral teeth, showing that similar signalling and transcription factors are expressed during oral and pharyngeal odontogenesis  <cit> . however, detailed comparison of expression patterns between zebrafish pharyngeal and mouse oral tooth development showed differences and some molecular markers are specific for mouse oral  or zebrafish pharyngeal  odontogenesis. additional studies have focused on comparative analysis between oral and pharyngeal dentitions within a given organism. they showed that, in extant teleost fish, teeth in the jaw or in the pharynx develop through similar gene expression patterns  <cit> . these results support the hypothesis that a single developmental grn is initiated at different locations to make up oral and pharyngeal teeth through a simple mechanism of heterotopy  <cit> . these studies led to a more comprehensive scenario about odontode origin and evolution  that postulates serial homology between all gnathostome odontodes, as defined by the sharing of a common grn for their development  <cit> . oral teeth, pharyngeal teeth/denticles, and dermal denticles would then belong to this odontode group, developmentally characterized by:  the presence of a neural-crest derived mesenchyme;  any epithelium able to respond to a mesenchyme signal  <cit> .

in order to test the "inside and out" model, we searched for both developmental and genetic similarities between dermal denticles and oral teeth in the dogfish, scyliorhinus canicula. in this species, histological observations support that tooth and dermal denticle development display similarities with that of osteichthyans  <cit> . among the different subsets of dermal denticle described during dogfish embryogenesis by mellinger and wrisez  <cit> , we chose to work on the earliest developing ones, the caudal primary scales. they are located at the very tip of the tail, develop from caudal to rostral, are clearly observable in  <dig> mm long embryos, and are organised as four bilateral lines . currently, only few expression data have been described for tooth and dermal denticles development in chondrichthyans: shh  <cit> , epha <dig>  <cit> , runx <dig> and runx <dig>  <cit> , each gene showing a similar expression pattern in both structures. these expression patterns were not characterized on histological sections, therefore the tissue-specific transcriptional dynamics  cannot be compared between structures or to other gnathostome species. to test the hypothesis of serial homology between tooth and dermal denticle development, we have characterised the expression of all dlx gene family members identified in the dogfish, following a strategy that already allowed us to propose that a single grn is involved in both oral and pharyngeal teeth in medaka  <cit> . this gene family represents a paradigmatic genetic marker to test if one or two independent grn are involved in tooth-like structures because:  this gene family includes at least six members in gnathostomes, transcribed with different expression patterns during tooth development in the mouse  <cit>  and teleosts  <cit> , and  contrary to the variability of dlx patterns between species, the regulation of dlx expression patterns is not dissociated between the different dentitions within a given organism  <cit> .

we show here that the first developing teeth and caudal primary scales form through four common typical stages that correspond to the common stages we previously identified for oral and pharyngeal odontogenesis in mouse and teleosts  <cit> . we have identified six dlx genes in the dogfish and analysed their expression patterns in teeth and caudal primary scales at the histological level. three of them showed strong transcription in both structures  whereas lower transcription levels could be detected for dlx <dig> in dermal denticles and teeth, and for dlx <dig> in dermal denticles. we observed very little difference in the transcription patterns of a given dlx gene between teeth and caudal primary scales, except for the lack of dlx <dig> transcription specifically in tooth buds. these results strongly suggest that a single set of dlx genes is involved in oral tooth and dermal denticle development in the dogfish and therefore strongly support the hypothesis of serial homology between these odontodes. in this context, we propose that dlx genes belong to a core set of developmental genes involved in all odontode development in gnathostomes. our results imply that the grn involved in odontode formation could have been initiated at several location  by simple heterotopy during the course of evolution and therefore represent the first detailed molecular support for the "inside and out" model.

RESULTS
tooth and dermal denticle development
as mentioned by mellinger and wrisez  <cit>  the first developing dermal denticles  and teeth could be observed at the very tip of the tail and the lower jaw, respectively . in order to follow the pattern of mineralization in the first developing teeth and dermal denticles, jaws and tails dissected from dogfish embryos measuring from  <dig> cm to  <dig> cm were stained with alizarin red . at the tip of the tail, buds of caudal primary scales were first observable in  <dig>  cm long embryos. as previously described  <cit> , caudal scale development progressed in a posterior to anterior wave in the terminal part of the tail:  <dig> cm-long embryos showed alizarin red staining only in the very caudal scales while very young scale buds were still at early stage of development in the anterior part of the primary scale-forming area . in  <dig>  cm long embryo, four scales were mineralized in the dorsal and ventral parts of the tail . in  <dig> cm long  and older embryos, the full set of caudal primary scales was stained with alizarin red  although the most rostral scales were not erupted yet . we chose to name these scales dorsal or ventral caudal scales  respectively - <dig> to - <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  from caudal to rostral: number refers to the rank of apparition during development, but few variations in scale number were observed between specimens.

the detailed pattern of tooth development was difficult to identify by alizarin red staining: the first mineralized tooth could be detected in embryos reaching  <dig> cm long while there were at least five on each quadrant in  <dig> cm long embryos . despite some individual variations, the first tooth bud generally appeared lateral to the symphysis, and then two other tooth buds developed on both sides of the first tooth. additional teeth subsequently developed on the jaw margin, from the symphyseal  portion towards the articulation . new tooth buds also developed between teeth of the first row, in a more posterior second row of teeth, starting in  <dig>  cm long embryo . a third row of tooth buds was observable in  <dig>  cm long embryos .

histological characterization of tooth and dermal denticle developmental stages
in order to depict the modifications of the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments through tooth and dermal denticle development, we performed histological sections and nissl stain  coloration on dissected tails of  <dig> cm long embryos and on lower jaws for embryos ranging from  <dig> cm to  <dig>  cm long .

the first developing oral tooth and caudal primary scale buds showed the same successive cellular and histological stages that those previously shown to be common between oral and pharyngeal tooth development in osteichthyans  <cit> . in addition, cellular and histological aspects of scale bud development were similar to tooth bud stages. in both structures, the early morphogenesis stage  started with the placode formation: the shape of odontogenic epithelial cells changed from cubic to prismatic and the underlying mesenchyme began to condensate . at late morphogenesis stage , the epithelium progressively folded and enclosed the mesenchymal compartment resulting in a bell-shaped bud. at that stage, we could distinguish between early lm stage when the epithelium started to fold  and late lm stage when the epithelium fold was more pronounced and the bud exhibited a typical bell shape . the third stage, ed , was characterized by a constriction that could be observed at the basis of the bell on both scale and tooth buds . during the last stage, ld , epithelial cells had their nucleus shifted towards the apical pole and showed secreting vesicles in their basal cytoplasm. the first signs of matrix deposition confirmed that ameloblasts were fully differentiated . differentiation of the odontoblasts was not included in this analysis as no histological sign could be identified showing their synthesis activity. these observations are summarised in the diagram in figure 2k.

overall expression of dlx genes in first forming teeth and dermal denticles
two segments for each dlx coding sequences were amplified from the dogfish genome by degenerate pcr based on the six dlx sequences identified in triakis semifasciata  <cit> . these segments were concatenated and phylogenetic analyses were performed to check their orthology to gnathostome dlx <dig> to dlx <dig> . the amplified sequences were used to synthesize anti-sense rna probes against the dlx mrnas in the dogfish .

we performed in situ hybridizations on dissected tails of  <dig>  cm to  <dig> cm long embryos  and on lower jaws for embryos ranging from  <dig> cm to  <dig>  cm long, in order to describe gene expression in the first developing teeth and caudal primary scales through their whole developing process. transcripts were detected at high levels in both structures for three out of six dlx genes: dlx <dig>  dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> . lower levels of expression could be detected with the dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> probes in developing caudal primary scales, and with dlx <dig> probes in developing teeth . dlx <dig> transcripts were never detected, either in tooth or scale buds .

tissue specific expression of dlx genes during dermal denticle development
in order to obtain a detailed description of the dlx gene expression patterns during the development of dermal denticles in the dogfish, we prepared histological sections of the whole-mount hybridized tails, and assigned each caudal primary scale bud to one of the four stages of development described in figure  <dig>  caudal primary scale development lasts over weeks and expression patterns may change along a given developmental stage. we observed as many buds as possible for each stage, and separated the lm into an early and a late lm, in order to obtain a more detailed view of the dynamic changes of expression patterns. for a given probe, the expression dynamic is identical in at least the sixteen first caudal primary scales , so the values given for each stage in the following paragraph result from pooling together our observations as summarized in table  <dig> 

data are calculated as the number of buds with positive staining out of the number of observed buds 

during caudal primary scale development, we detected low levels of dlx <dig> transcripts in the thickened epithelium of all bud placodes . dlx <dig> transcripts were then detected at higher levels in the epithelial compartment of both the lm stage and ed stage . finally, transcription of dlx <dig> was detected only in the epithelial layer in the beginning of the ld stage . dlx <dig> transcripts were detected in the mesenchyme in only some of the scale buds during the lm stage : early lm group showed both negative and positive buds  while positive staining was always observed in late lm buds . transcription of dlx <dig> was therefore progressively initiated during the beginning of the lm stage. dlx <dig> transcripts were apparent in the mesenchyme of ed scale buds  but undetectable in ld stages, showing a negative regulation of dlx <dig> during the ld stage .

transcripts of dlx <dig> were detected with the same expression pattern: in the epithelium of caudal primary scale buds during the em , lm , ed  and ld  stages and in the mesenchyme of scale buds at the lm , ed  and ld . again, during the lm stage, positive staining was mainly observed in more late lm buds  while positive buds were rarely observed in the early lm group . positive staining in the mesenchyme of ld stages was more frequently observed in less developed buds, suggesting that dlx <dig> expression is turned off early during ld.

we also detected dlx <dig> transcripts in the epithelium of caudal primary scale bud during the four stages of development , and in the mesenchymal compartment of the lm , ed  and ld  stages .

histological sections on hybridized tails revealed no detectable expression of dlx <dig> at any stage , while dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> transcripts were detected at low intensity . we used these same dlx probes on whole-mount embryos at early stage of organogenesis , and could get strong signals for every dlx genes here identified . we concluded that our results with dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> probes were not due to experiment or probe artefact, but most likely were a consequence of low expression levels for these two genes during caudal primary scale development. dlx <dig> transcripts were detected in the epithelium of scale buds at the lm , ed  and ld  stages as well as in the mesenchyme of ed  scale buds , showing a progressive up-regulation of dlx <dig> in the late lm/early ed stage. dlx <dig> transcripts were detected in the epithelium of caudal primary scale buds at the em , lm , ed  and ld  stages. dlx <dig> expression was also detected in the mesenchymal compartment of scale buds during lm  stage, most of the positive buds being in the late lm group . transcripts were then detected during ed  stage but undetectable in ld , showing activation of dlx <dig> transcription during the lm stage and down-regulation early in the ld stage. the dynamics of each dlx gene expression in the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments of primary scale buds are graphically illustrated in figure 5a and 5c.

tissue specific expression of dlx genes during tooth development
as described for dermal denticles, we pooled our observations for the eight first teeth  and summarized our results in table  <dig>  during tooth development, dlx <dig>  dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> transcription started in the epithelial compartment of em buds and was maintained in lm, ed and ld . expression in the mesenchymal compartment started during the lm stage  and most of the positive buds were found in the late lm group . expression in the mesenchymal compartment was maximum for dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> during the ed stage  but down regulation of their expression was apparent during the ld stage . dlx <dig> transcripts were detected in the mesenchyme of some of the tooth buds at the ed stage  and was maximal in ld stage buds . expression of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> could not be significantly detected by in situ hybridization followed by histological sections. among  <dig> dlx <dig> hybridized teeth, we were able to detect a very weak signal in the epithelium during the lm stage of six developing tooth buds. we decided to consider that these data were not significant, but we cannot exclude that the level of dlx <dig> transcription was too low to be detected by the in situ hybridization technique. on the contrary, dlx1consistently showed low levels of expression in developing tooth buds: transcripts were detected in the epithelium of all four stages of development , and transient expression in the mesenchyme of ed buds could be observed .

data are calculated as the number of buds with positive staining out of the number of observed buds 

discussion
dermal denticle and tooth development progress through common developmental stages
it has long been considered that oral teeth and dermal denticles display developmental similarities  <cit> . the histological data we obtained for embryonic oral tooth and caudal primary scale development in the dogfish are in accordance with those obtained previously in other elasmobranch species or at later stages of dogfish development  <cit> . in addition, our morphological and histological observations show that teeth and scales share morphogenetic similarities through four developmental stages, which are also shared with mammalian oral teeth and teleost pharyngeal or oral teeth  <cit> . as a consequence, we postulate here that all odontodes, whatever their location, develop through four common successive stages including the formation of a placode , shaping of the bud , differentiation of ameloblasts and odontoblasts  , and matrix deposition . similar organization and composition of the fully developed teeth and dermal denticles, as well as similar stages of development, support the hypothesis of serial homology between epithelial mineralized structures.

serial homology of odontodes is molecularly supported by non-dissociation of dlx expression patterns in caudal primary scales and teeth
to further explore the potential link of serial homology between odontodes we analysed the expression pattern of six dlx genes in scyliorhinus canicula. we assumed that these six genes constitute the whole set of dlx genes in the dogfish, which also was the probable ancestral state in gnathostomes  <cit> , even if we cannot exclude that individual duplications occurred in the dogfish lineage. no expression of dlx <dig> could be detected in either tooth or scale buds. dlx <dig>  dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> were expressed in the epithelial compartment during all four common stages of caudal primary scale and tooth development . in the mesenchymal compartment, transcription of dlx <dig>  dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> was initiated during the lm stage and then down-regulated shortly after the ed stage for dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> while expression of dlx <dig> was still on during the ld stage. the expression dynamics of each of these three genes show only subtle differences between caudal primary scale and tooth. first, more than 40% of the tooth buds we examined show no transcription of dlx <dig> in the epithelium during the initiation of expression at em stage whereas it is expressed in the epithelium of all caudal primary scale buds . similarly, dlx <dig> transcription in the mesenchyme is never detected in 100% of tooth buds as it is in scale buds . second, the dynamic of transcription of dlx <dig> is identical in the epithelium of both tooth and caudal primary scale  but the expression in the mesenchyme at ed is detectable in all scale buds stage but only in about 80% of the tooth buds . expression of dlx <dig> was also similar in the mesenchymal compartment of both caudal primary scale and tooth buds, with transient expression during the ed stage. however, the dlx <dig> expression pattern showed heterochrony in the epithelial compartment as transcription started during the lm stage in scale buds, while it was already active in the em stage in tooth buds. note that dlx <dig> signal was very weak compared to dlx <dig>  dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> and we cannot exclude that dlx <dig> expression was too weak to be detected during the early morphogenesis stages. the main difference observed in this study is the complete lack of expression of dlx <dig> during tooth development, while the expression dynamic of this gene was similar  to those of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> during scale bud development. in conclusion, we show that the tissue specific expression patterns of each dlx genes are nearly identical  during oral tooth and dermal denticle development in the dogfish. taken together with our previous data on oral and pharyngeal dentitions, the results presented here show that the dlx genes expression patterns did not undergo dissociation between odontodes  that form at different locations  in a given species. therefore, all odontodes of a given organism appear to be serially homologous because they bud through the redeployment of common developmental stages associated with a similarly regulated set of dlx genes.

different dlx expression patterns during odontode development among jawed vertebrates
in order to gain insights into the evolution of dlx expression patterns during gnathostome odontode development we compared our results with those published in mouse  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit>  and medaka  <cit> . a summary of expression patterns published for the mouse mus musculus , zebrafish danio rerio , medaka oryzias latipes  and dogfish scyliorhinus canicula  are presented in table  <dig>  note that the results recently obtained for dlx expression during pharyngeal tooth development in an african cichlid   <cit>  were consistent with what had previously described for dlx expression in the medaka and were therefore omitted in the table  <dig> in order to clarify the analysis. contrasting with the non dissociation of dlx expression patterns in odontodes within a given species , the set of genes expressed varies highly between species: dlx <dig> is never expressed during zebrafish or medaka odontogenesis while dlx <dig> is not expressed during dogfish or zebrafish odontogenesis. this observation suggests that a specific combination of dlx genes was not strictly constrained during gnathostome evolution, probably because the redundancy between the different paralogs favoured function shuffling. on the other hand, dlx <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are transcribed in all three species even though their expression patterns vary, especially in the epithelial compartment. common points are restricted to:  early epithelial transcription for dlx <dig> ;  mesenchymal transcription for all four genes during lm and ed ;  late  mesenchymal transcription for dlx <dig>  given the homology relationship proposed between gnathostome odontodes, these similar features might be inherited from the gnathostome last common ancestor . another trend is highlighted with this comparison: expression of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> in the epithelium at all stages is observed in all species but the mouse .

data were showed for the six paralogous groups, as published in mouse  <cit> , zebrafish  <cit> , medaka  <cit>  and dogfish  . species initials are indicated when positive expression has been published in the epithelial  or mesenchymal  compartments in the different stages. see legend of figure  <dig> for abbreviations of developmental stages; m: mouse, mus musculus; o: medaka, oryzias latipes; d: zebrafish, danio rerio; s: dogfish, scyliorhinus canicula; -: no expression detected. expression of dogfish dlx <dig> that was observed only in scale buds is indicated in brackets, expression of medaka dlx5a observed only in oral teeth is indicated in brackets. bold shows characteristics conserved among all gnathostomes, italics indicate characteristics possibly lost in mouse.

this may be interpreted as a specific loss in the lineage leading to the mouse , and could even be viewed as a single evolutionary event if one considers that the epithelial expression of dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> is up-regulated by one single activator. if considered as a single evolutionary event, the most parsimonious scenario to explain these data would be that dlx <dig> and dlx <dig> were transcribed in the epithelium of odontode buds at all stages in the gnathostome last common ancestor, and that this trait was lost secondarily in the sarcopterygian lineage leading to the mouse . this result could be correlated to the different roles taken by the epithelial compartment in sarcopterygians as opposed to non-sarcopterygians  <cit> . in non-sarcopterygians , the outer-most layer of mineralized tissue  is synthesized by a cooperation between the mesenchymal  and the epithelial  compartments  <cit> . on the contrary, the sarcopterygian outer mineralized layer  is composed of enamel, which has been showed to be synthesized exclusively from the epithelial layer of ameloblasts with specific secretory characteristics  <cit> .

another prominent result is the lack of early dlx <dig> expression  in the mesenchyme of tooth and dermal denticle buds in the dogfish. this early expression in the mesenchymal compartment was observed in the mouse, zebrafish and medaka, and is a specificity of the dlx <dig> orthologs. two equi-parsimonious scenarios can be proposed:  the early mesenchymal expression of dlx <dig> is a novelty acquired in the last common ancestor of bony fish only;  the early mesenchymal expression of dlx <dig> is an ancestral gnathostome characteristic, and it has been lost in the chondrichthyan lineage . note that the lack of dlx <dig> expression in dogfish teeth is most probably a derived state  as dlx <dig> expression is detected in dogfish scales. other data presented in table  <dig> do not allow to propose one most parsimonious scenario for expression pattern evolution: one-species characteristic i.e. apomorphy, or two-species characteristic leading to convergence  + medaka , or zebrafish  + dogfish ).

CONCLUSIONS
here, we present a detailed comparison of tooth and dermal denticle development in the dogfish that show that odontodes should accurately be considered as serial homologous structures. indeed in a given species, the development of the different odontodes involves  the localised redeployment of the same developmental stages, and  the localised redeployment of the same dlx expression patterns . we reasoned that, if an ancestral regulation of dlx expression had dissociated and evolved independently in the different odontodes after its cooption at different locations, there should be more differences between expression patterns when comparing structures in one organism  than when comparing homologous structures between extant gnathostomes . however, we observe more divergence between the dlx expression patterns of different species than between serial homologous structures within a species such as dogfish teeth and dermal denticles  or teleost oral and pharyngeal teeth, as shown in the additional file  <dig>  we conclude that the reiterated expression of the dynamic dlx patterns in teeth and dermal denticles within a given organism reveals that the different odontodes form from the reiterated expression of a single grn. our results therefore provide the first detailed molecular supports for the "inside and out" model  <cit>  that propose that all odontodes are serially homologous structures that form through the control of a common odontode gene regulatory network . this ancestral ogrn may include, in addition to the dlx family, several other genes such as shh, epha <dig>  and runx, that were shown to be expressed during both scale and tooth development in chondrichthyans  <cit> , and during oral and/or pharyngeal tooth development in mouse and/or teleost fish  <cit> . the evolutionary scenario for the relative time of appearance of the different odontodes depends on the phyletic relationships between fossil agnathans such as conodonts and thelodonts, extant agnathans, and extant gnathostomes, which remain controversial  <cit> . our results support the hypothesis that the grn involved in the development of serially homologous odontodes has not dissociated over gnathostome evolution. this implies that, during the course of evolution, the diversity of gnathostome odontodes arose from independent gains of expression territories of a single ancestral grn by simple heterotopy. therefore, molecular developmental data would not allow comparing odontodes in order to evaluate their divergence over evolutionary time. as a consequence, only additional paleontological data can shed a new light on the evolutionary events leading to the diversity of odontodes.
