BACKGROUND
alcoholic fermentation represents the largest application of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in the field of industrial biotechnology. in  <dig>  worldwide fuel ethanol production reached  <dig>  billion liters  <cit> . with increased ethanol use as a biofuel and continued growth in its production for distilled beverages, the worldwide annual production of ethanol will exceed in  <dig>  <dig> billion liters. due to economic and environmental reasons, exponential growth in the production of fuel ethanol was observed over the past decade  <cit> . though lignocellulose is considered to be one of the most promising feedstocks for production of fuel ethanol, its current industrial production relies heavily on fermentation of traditional feedstocks such as sucrose  and glucose obtained from starchy materials . therefore the construction of the strains of s. cerevisiae with elevated ethanol production  from glucose is of great academic and industrial interest. we decided to reach this goal by manipulation of the atp content in the cell.

the yeast s. cerevisiae catabolizes glucose via the embden-meyerhof-parnas  pathway which yield anaerobically  <dig> moles atp per mole of consumed glucose. the efficiency of this pathway for anabolic processes is low with a maximal biomass yield of around 7% and an ethanol yield in the range of 90% - 93% from the glucose consumed  <cit> . even a slight shift of this ratio in favour of greater ethanol yield from dextrose, can provide an additional several millions litres of ethanol to the worldwide production annually. in contrast to s. cerevisiae, the bacterium, zymomonas mobilis, ferments glucose through entner-doudoroff  pathway. this pathway provides only  <dig> mole of atp per mole of glucose, and consequently directs only 3% of glucose to cell biomass achieving ethanol yield of up to 97% of the possible theoretical value  <cit> . this indicates that lowering the atp yield during alcoholic fermentation increases ethanol yield with reduced substrate conversion to cell mass. fast fermentation of glucose to ethanol is another important advantage of z. mobilis over s. cerevisiae <cit> . attempts to substitute s. cerevisiae by z. mobilis for the production of industrial ethanol were considered to be a promising approach to increase ethanol yield. however, z. mobilis has several serious drawbacks which hamper its industrial use and these consist of:  a very narrow substrate range ,  natural auxotrophy for lysine, methionine and some vitamins,  non-gras status, which prevents using cellular biomass as a feed additive,  requirement for a higher ph for growth  <cit> . furthermore, the technology of yeast cell utilization for alcoholic fermentation is well developed whereas the use of bacterial cells for ethanol production is far less common. thus, it looks like construction of the yeast strains which produce less atp during alcoholic fermentation would be a better approach to increase ethanol yield. these new yeast strains would combine all of the possible advantages of yeast with the high ethanol yield of z. mobilis. there could be several approaches to achieve this goal, for example:  substitution of emp pathway in yeast by ed pathway from z. mobilis or other bacteria possessing genes of the pathway;  increasing the activity of the enzymes involved in generation of futile cycles;  the introduction of heterologous genes encoding for energy-consuming plasma membrane glucose symporters or  construction of recombinant strains with elevated activity of atpase of other atp-degrading enzymes  <cit> .

the first approach to express escherichia coli ed dehydratase and ed aldolase genes edd and eda in a phosphofructokinase deficient mutant of s. cerevisiae has been published  <cit> . the engineered strains grew and fermented glucose to ethanol, though activities of ed dehydratase and ed aldolase were not reported. it is known that quite often prokaryotic enzymes display low or no activity in s. cerevisiae hosts  <cit> , which is most likely caused by improper folding or instability of the expressed bacterial protein in yeast. in addition, there are difficulties in nadp regeneration in the yeast engineered to possess ed pathway since nadph produced in the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction, cannot be re-oxidized via alcohol dehydrogenase reaction and yeast does not have nadh/nadph transhydrogenase activity  <cit> .

alternative approaches to lower atp level in yeast cell and increase ethanol yield could rely on the activation of some cytosolic atpases, other atp hydrolyzing enzymes or via the induction of the some kinds of futile cycles to dissipate cellular pool of atp, e.g. bacterial or modified yeast fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase  <cit> . there are also published data on decrease of cellular pool of atp and activation of alcoholic fermentation through overexpression of the soluble part  of h+-atpase or a portion of f <dig> exhibiting atpase from different origin in s. cerevisiae <cit> . similar results were obtained after overexpression of pho <dig> coding for acid phosphatase which is non-specific enzyme hydrolyzing also atp  <cit> .

in earlier work, we carried out a successful attempt to decrease intracellular atp level by overexpression of 5’ part of the s. cerevisiae ssb <dig> gene encoding cytosolic atpase domain and by the heterologous gene apy encoding apyrase from e. coli <cit> . in this paper, we describe a new method to lower cellular atp and increase ethanol yield and productivity during glucose fermentation by overexpression of s. cerevisiae intact pho <dig> gene which codes for alkaline phosphatase.

RESULTS
overexpression of the vacuolar forms of alkaline phosphatase in by <dig> laboratory strain
s. cerevisiae unspecific alkaline phosphatase , located in the vacuole, encoded by the gene pho <dig>  catalyses the dephosphorylation of many different compounds including atp  <cit> . therefore this enzyme may operate as non-specific atpase. we hypothesized that an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity will reduce intracellular atp level and thus enhance ethanol production under anaerobic conditions. several factors should be taken into account to increase specific activity of the target enzyme in yeast. among these are the copy numbers used for the gene of interest, choice of promoter which controls expression level, stability of the synthetized mrna, and enzyme feedback inhibition. we have demonstrated that the adh <dig> promoter for the gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase that we used in this work, is very strong and is two-fold activated under the conditions of alcoholic fermentation . therefore the adh <dig> gene promoter was used for pho <dig> gene overexpression. additional activation of pho <dig> overexpression can be achieved by multicopy genomic integration. in order to insert a high copy number of the pho <dig> gene into the yeast genome, an integrative plasmid containing δ sequences was constructed. the s. cerevisiae δ sequences are the long terminal repeats of the retro-transposons ty <dig> and ty <dig> with an estimated  <dig> δ sequences dispersed throughout the yeast genome. it was shown that the use of vectors containing δ sequences can provide tandem multicopy integration in one or several sites of yeast genomic dna via homologous recombination  <cit> . the δ sequences-based plasmid puc57-delta1_2-adhpr-pho8-cyct-kanmx harboring pho <dig> gene under the control of adh <dig> promoter was constructed as described in materials and methods and subsequently transformed into s. cerevisiae laboratory strain by <dig> .

the specific alkaline phosphatase activity of the selected recombinant strains, derivative of by <dig>  was assayed. among  <dig> tested transformants, six strains were characterized by 30– <dig> times higher specific phosphatase activity relative to the wild-type strain by <dig> . the data confirm that the constructed expression vector provided multi-copy integration into the genome of s. cerevisiae.

genomic dna isolated from the recombinant strains was subjected to dot-blot hybridization to estimate plasmid copy number harbouring target gene, integrated into the genome. gene pho <dig> was used as a probe . the recombinant strains contained 1– <dig> additional copies of pho <dig> gene with a good correlation between pho <dig> gene copy number and specific alkaline phosphatase activity was observed.

southern-hybridization was performed to analyse the vector integration pattern of the tested strains . total genomic dna from wild type and recombinant strains were hindiii digested and hybridized with a labelled pho <dig> gene. the constructed δ sequences-based vector had tandem multi-copy integration in up to three sites of yeast genomic dna in the so called “head-to-tail” conformation , which is in good agreement with previously published results  <cit> .

a selected recombinant strain with substantially enhanced level of specific alkaline phosphatase activity showed small defects in biomass accumulation and intracellular atp level relative to that of the wild-type strain . ethanol productivity of the wild-type strain by <dig> was  <dig>  g/l/h or  <dig>  g/g of biomass/h, whereas the recombinant strain by4742/pho8vac, had a much higher productivity:  <dig>  g/l/h or  <dig>  g/g of biomass/h during glucose alcoholic fermentation. the pho8-overexpressing recombinant strain accumulated 13% more ethanol as compared to the parental strain by <dig> . the data provide proof to our initial hypothesis that the overexpression of alkaline phosphatase can be used to increase ethanol synthesis during glucose alcoholic fermentation.

overexpression of the vacuolar form of alkaline phosphatase in as <dig> industrial strain
the vacuolar form of alkaline phosphatase was also expressed in the industrial ethanol-producing strain as <dig>  the plasmid puc57-delta1_2-adhpr-pho8-cyct-kanmx was used for transformation of the strain as <dig>  selected transformants as400/pho8vac had  <dig> -fold increase in the specific activity of alkaline phosphatase as compared to the parental strain as <dig> . the recombinant strain as400/pho8vac with the highest specific activity of alkaline phosphatase and the parental as <dig> strain were tested for the efficiency of alcoholic fermentation in a mineral ynb medium supplemented with 20% glucose. biomass and ethanol accumulation was measured in transformant as400/pho8vac and the parental strain as <dig> . based on the results, it was determined that the transformant as400/pho8vac accumulated 6% more ethanol relative to parental strain during fermentation producing  <dig>  g/l/h of ethanol versus  <dig>  g/l/h for as <dig> strain . due to slight difference in the biomass accumulation and complete glucose consumption during fermentation, differences in ethanol production between parental and recombinant strains may be caused by the decrease of byproducts accumulation like glycerol, acetate or reduced amount of reserve carbohydrates. the recombinant strain as400/pho8vac was also tested for the efficiency of alcoholic fermentation in a csl medium supplemented with hydrolysed corn meal. this strain was shown to have substantially increased productivity of ethanol synthesis  as compared to that of the parental strain  . ethanol yield per gram of consumed glucose was found to be increased  <dig> % . measurement of the productivity of ethanol synthesis per biomass was not carried out in csl medium as it contains many small insoluble particles which hamper cell biomass measurement using direct dry weight or by optical density analyses. the recombinant strains tested were all also characterized by substantially lower intracellular atp level relative to the parental strain as <dig> . we do not exclude the possibility that the drop in intracellular atp level may have a negative impact on biomass accumulation during aerobic large-scale cultivation, but we assume that this effect will be insignificant, since biomass accumulation of recombinant strain as400/pho8vac didn’t differ substantially from the parental strain as <dig> in the experiments we carried out .


overexpression of the cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase in by4742

the results demonstrate that the overexpression of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase leads to an increase in ethanol production during alcoholic fermentation of glucose in laboratory and industrial strains of s. cerevisiae. this is due to the accelerated hydrolysis of substrate via increased activity from overexpression of vacuolar alkaline phosphatase. the target substrates are polyphosphates which are known to be the natural substrates of alkaline phosphatase  <cit> . as the synthesis of polyphosphates requires atp, an increase in alkaline phosphatase activity may lead to a futile cycle of atp consumption which enhances need for atp to replenish again the vacuolar polyphosphate pool  <cit> . we decided to check the effects of overexpression of the truncated forms of alkaline phosphatase which lack putative vacuolar targeting signal. a recombinant strain expressing truncated version of pho <dig> gene was constructed. alkaline phosphatase is synthesized as an inactive precursor containing a c-terminal propeptide that is afterwards cleaved from the protein in yeast vacuoles in a pep4-dependent manner  <cit> . during vacuolar delivery, which shares the early stages with the secretory pathway, the precursor form of this enzyme is glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. it has also been shown that the active form of alkaline phosphatase binds with the metal co-factor zinc in the vacuole rather than in earlier compartments of the secretory pathway  <cit> . a truncated form of this enzyme was constructed which lacks  <dig> initial amino acids that are responsible for transmembrane protein delivery; and additionally  <dig> terminal amino acids, that represent the c-terminal propeptide that is normally cleaved from the protein in the vacuole  <cit> . the dna fragment containing the expression cassette of the truncated pho <dig> gene in part with selective marker flanked by δ sequences were used for transformation of by <dig> strain of s. cerevisiae. the specific alkaline phosphatase activity of the selected recombinant strain by4742/pho8cyt was assayed and compared with that of the strain by4742/pho8vac. the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity in the strain by4742/pho8cyt was at the same level as in the strain by4742/pho8vac overexpressing the intact form of pho <dig> .

growth kinetics of the constructed recombinant strains was measured. an equal amount of cellular biomass  of wild-type strain and recombinant strains were inoculated into the mineral media containing 10% glucose as a carbon source. the strain with truncated pho <dig> form was characterized by a longer lag-phase during the first day of cultivation , with lowered biomass accumulation and a reduced growth rate . this recombinant strain  had the highest specific activity of cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase showed a decrease in the intracellular atp level .

recombinant strain by4742/pho8cyt has produced significantly less ethanol during glucose alcoholic fermentation relative to recombinant strains with overexpressed native alkaline phosphatase and the wild-type strain by <dig>  i.e. only about  <dig>  g/l/h or  <dig>  g/g of biomass/h . we hypothesize that the cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase decreases not only the level of atp but also that of other sugar phosphate intermediates as well as regulators like fructose- <dig> -bisphosphate, leading to detrimental effect on ethanol production. however, confirmation of this hypothesis requires additional experiments which are in progress.

CONCLUSIONS
this study established a new successful approach to increasing ethanol production from glucose in s. cerevisiae by homologous overexpression of pho <dig> gene due to multiple genomic insertion events. the overexpression of intact pho <dig> gene encoding vacuolar form of alkaline phosphatase led to decline in intracellular atp level and biomass accumulation and up to 13% increase in ethanol productivity. by comparison, the overexpression of truncated form of pho <dig> gene encoding presumably cytosolic form of alkaline phosphatase caused a significant drop both in biomass accumulation and ethanol production. in conclusion, the overexpression of the intact vacuolar form of alkaline phosphatase results in overproduction of ethanol in laboratory and industrial strains of s. cerevisiae.
