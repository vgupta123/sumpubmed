BACKGROUND
intracellular compartments represented by membrane-delineated regions with specific lipids and proteins contents are characteristic of eukaryotic cells. membrane trafficking connects all compartments allowing on the one hand lipids and proteins synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum  to reach their intended organelle and on the other hand exchanges with the extracellular medium
 <cit> . this makes membrane trafficking an important object of evolutionary studies, since these mechanisms are fundamentally inherent to the multi-organelle status of eukaryotes
 <cit> . among the different intracellular compartments, endosomes are central, since they are at the crossroads of several trafficking pathways and should therefore contain the vestiges of the first eukaryotic endomembrane system, a key factor for later evolution
 <cit> . endosomes are at the intersection of the endocytic, phagocytic, golgi to lysosome trafficking , autophagy and plasma membrane recycling pathways. at the endosomes, effectors and cargo proteins following these different pathways are sorted to reach their final destination, henceforth we will gather this under the name endosomal system
 <cit> . specific key regulators of the endosomal system contain an enth , an anth  or a vhs  domain at their n-terminus
 <cit> . structural analyses resulted in the grouping of these proteins in the enth/anth/vhs superfamily, while functional analyses and sequence homologies led to their further classification into families and subfamilies
 <cit> .

these regulators also termed adaptors localize at the golgi, endosomal or plasma membrane and function in pairs of proteins from different subfamilies such as the anth sla2/hip <dig> and the enth ent1-2/epsin <dig> , <dig> in endocytosis. they are required for cargo sorting into vesicles and recruitment of scaffold or accessory trafficking effectors
 <cit> . indeed, most enth and anth domains are lipid binding domains specifically interacting with a given phosphoinositide enriched at the target membrane
 <cit> . cargo recruitment is mediated by interaction either with ubiquitin tagging the cargo  sorting or a peptide-motif as for the mannose-6-phosphate receptor 
 <cit> . moreover, to ensure the correct assembly and budding of vesicles, most plasma membrane and golgi localized adaptors also interact with clathrin through their c-terminal clathrin binding sites
 <cit> . indeed, clathrin, the major component of vesicle coats at the plasma membrane and golgi, depends on such adaptors for its membrane recruitment.

in addition to being studied experimentally, many protein families involved in trafficking have been analyzed in evolutionary studies
 <cit> . for example, extensive studies of the cop  proteins required for the formations of the vesicles at early secretory pathway  showed that they have a similar structure to clathrin coat, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of the vesicular coat structure
 <cit> . other in-depth investigations include the gtpase  and snare  receptor) families that are required for the formation of the trafficking vesicles and their fusion with membranes  forming the escrt- <dig>  complex or the gga proteins required for exit from the golgi  or the plasma membrane epsins  are specific to fungi and metazoa 
 <cit> .

here we performed an extensive analysis of enth/anth/vhs superfamily members found in the proteomes of  <dig> fully sequenced organisms representing different eukaryotic taxa. analysis of the presence/absence profiles of the different subfamilies revealed that the entha, picalm and gga subfamilies were present prior to the divergence in the various eukaryotic taxa. moreover, the genomic distribution of this superfamily perfectly reflects the dichotomy between opisthokonta and plantae. comparative genomics of four proteomes and phylogenetic analyses revealed that a similar dichotomy was also observed for other protein families involved in the endosomal system but also in cytokinesis and metabolism. further analyses of these protein families show that the endosomal system was a key process linking both metabolism and cytokinesis. based on these results, we suggest an innovative evolutionary scenario, where the endosomal system drove the separation of fungi and metazoa from plantae and protists.

RESULTS
clustering of the enth/anth/vhs protein sequences
we analyzed the protein sequences of enth/anth/vhs superfamily members found in the genomes and proteomes of  <dig> fully sequenced metazoa, fungi, amoebazoa, plantae, excavata, euglenozoa, chromista and rhizaria taxa . proteins with an anth, enth or vhs domain were gathered by extensive blast  searches and used to generate a multiple alignment of complete sequences  composed of  <dig> proteins manually adjusted according to the structural data available on the distinct enth, anth and vhs proteins. at least one protein was found in all organisms except for one fungi  and three chromista . analysis of the macs allowed the clustering of all the proteins in: i)  <dig> vhs subfamilies gga , stam ), vhs  and tom , ii)  <dig> anth subfamilies anth and picalm , and iii)  <dig> enth subfamilies epsin, epsinr and two newly identified subfamilies of unknown function. to facilitate the discussion, we named the golgi/endosome epsinr subfamily: entha, the endocytic epsin subfamily: enthb, the new vertebrate specific epsins : enthc and the new fungi specific epsins : enthd.

as the c-terminal parts of these proteins are highly divergent and frequently specific of each family or subfamily, a robust phylogenetic tree  was calculated using the most conserved common region of the aligned proteins . the phylogenetic tree  based on the conserved n-terminal domain shows a very similar clustering to the one obtained with the full-length proteins thus suggesting that the n- and c-terminal parts of enth/anth/vhs proteins have experienced concerted selective pressures during evolution. broadly, plantae proteins of the anth family  and the vhs family  clustered on a separate branch from opisthokonta proteins. the enth subfamilies did not display such separation even though our phylogenetic tree confirmed that entha-containing proteins were localized on a separate branch from the enthb-containing protein  as previously described
 <cit> . indeed, most plantae entha subfamilies  clustered among the opisthokonta group and the last one  clustered on a separate branch displaying a closer relationship with protist and some fungal proteins . interestingly, the yeast ent <dig> protein and its fungal homologues are members of the enth family. due to its sequence divergence, the yeast ent <dig> protein was described either as belonging to the enth or anth family
 <cit> . based on our extended macs and the phylogenetic tree, it clearly stands out that this small group is clearly distinct from all other fungal anth members which cluster together on one branch separated from enth members. this is in keeping with the in vivo function of the yeast ent <dig> in golgi and endosomal sorting, a function performed by members of the entha subfamily
 <cit> . 

finally, an important point results from the analysis of the plantae, euglenozoa and amoebozoa proteins belonging to the vhs family. while our phylogenetic tree clustered these proteins with the opisthokonta gga subfamily, previous studies have classified them in the tom subfamily due to a domain organization similar to the metazoan tom, i.e. presence of a gat  domain and absence of a gae  domain
 <cit> ‐
 <cit> . to definitively assign these proteins to either the gga or the tom subfamily, we aligned their gat domain and a robust phylogenetic tree was calculated . this tree showed a clear clustering of all plantae and protist gat domains on the same branch as metazoa and fungi gga proteins whereas the metazoan gat domain of tom proteins clustered on a separate branch. confidence in this classification was acquired by analyzing both our alignment and the crystal structures of these domains. our alignment showed that the extreme n-terminus of tom proteins had a conserved pf domain and an extra amino acid between ∝-helices  <dig> and  <dig> compared to metazoa gga proteins or the plantae and protists proteins with a vhs domain . furthermore, the resolved structure of tom <dig> vhs domain shows that the conserved pf domain is a ∝-helical turn and ∝-helix  <dig> of gga is broken in tom proteins
 <cit> . these results clearly classify amoebozoa, plantae and euglenozoa vhs proteins in the gga subfamily and suggest that the gae domain was a later acquisition of opisthokonta gga proteins.

as a whole, gga-containing proteins revealed a complex evolution as illustrated by the fungal gga branch which is nested in the vhs subfamily cluster and closer to the metazoa than fungi vhs domain . since fungal gga proteins display the same domain composition and function as the mammalian ones
 <cit> , this result suggests that the vhs domain, specific to the opisthokonta taxa, evolved from the gga domain and certainly resulted from duplication. furthermore, the stam and tom subfamily, respectively specific to opisthokonta and metazoa, are more recent acquisitions that evolved from the vhs subfamily.

genomic distribution of the enth/anth/vhs superfamily members
after validating our clustering, we assessed the genomic distribution of the enth/anth/vhs members in the analyzed species . the presence/absence profile recapitulates the proposed evolution of the endocytic system
 <cit>  with metazoa and fungi  being closer to the amoebozoa than to plantae, chromista, excavata, rhizaria and euglenozoa subfamilies. opisthokonta possess the most complex panel with protein members in at least eight of the ten different subfamilies while amoebozoa display four distinct subfamilies with the presence of anth-containing proteins  in the two studied organisms d. discoideum and e. histolitica. plantae and euglenozoa have representatives only in entha, picalm and gga subfamilies while chromista and excavata only in the entha subfamily . this suggests that the entha, picalm and gga subfamilies conserved in different taxa were present prior to the formation of the different eukaryotic supergroups. 

the enthb subfamily , which is required for endocytosis, is specific to opisthokonta  , suggesting that this subfamily was acquired more recently probably by duplication of the entha subfamily. in addition, we identified two new opisthokonta subfamilies of unknown function: enthc found in most vertebrates except aves and enthd in the fungal subphylum saccharomycotina .

members of the anth family are also found in most taxa excluding the chromista and excavata, with the picalm subfamily composed of metazoa ap <dig> and calm and fungi yap1801- <dig> being the most conserved. this is in agreement with a previous study showing that ap <dig> is an ancient component of the endocytic system
 <cit> . in addition, our results show that the second anth subfamily  and hip1r, fungi sla <dig> and amoeboza hip1r), characterized by the i/lweq actin binding domain
 <cit> , is specific to opisthokonta and amoebozoa which form the unikonts
 <cit> . we do notice some exceptions with the fungi rhizopus oryzae and animalia monosiga brevicollis, trichoplax adhaerens, hydra magnapapillata, nematostella vectensis and amphimedon queenslandica missing the anth proteins probably due to protein loss .

analysis of the presence/absence profile in the vhs family shows that vhs and stam subfamilies, forming the endosomal sorting complex escrt- <dig> are specific to opisthokonta , as previously observed
 <cit> . here we also show that tom proteins are specific to metazoa and certainly a recent acquisition. moreover in vertebrates, stam and tom proteins are duplicated or even triplicated, whereas the vhs subfamily contains only one member despite its crucial role in endosomal sorting
 <cit> . this is even more surprising since this unique vhs protein directly interacts with the duplicated stam proteins to form the escrt- <dig> complex
 <cit> . nonetheless, total absence of the escrt- <dig> complex is observed in the fungi rhizopus oryzae or partial in animalia hydra magnapapillata and amphimedon queenslandica which have a tom but no stam . trichoplax adhaerens on the other hand has a stam but no tom protein. thus, such organisms could be ideally suited to better characterize the function of these proteins.

plantae, which undergo endocytosis and endosomal sorting
 <cit> , possess only entha, picalm and gga subfamilies, all of which had a complex evolution as illustrated by the high number of duplications in each subfamily that we could group in several types . despite being unable to assign clear functions to these different types, we could speculate on the potential functions of some entha types. indeed, plantae entha <dig>  entha <dig> types  and entha <dig> cluster with s. cerevisiae ent <dig>  and human epsinr and could thus function in golgi-to-endosomal sorting, while entha <dig> type proteins may have a different role in trafficking, possibly endocytosis. interestingly, the a. thaliana atepsin <dig> protein was shown to be required for golgi sorting of vacuolar protein  and atepsinr <dig> binds to ptdins3p suggesting an endosomal sorting function 
 <cit> .

comparative genomic analysis
membrane trafficking was proposed to be a key motor for the origin of eukaryotes via the acquisition of the endomembrane system
 <cit> ‐
 <cit> . our genomic distribution of the members of the enth/anth/vhs superfamily results in a clustering of organisms similar to the tree of life , this suggests that trafficking was also a driving force in eukaryotic diversification. if indeed this hypothesis is true, then other trafficking proteins should display a similar distribution, i.e. present in opisthokonta and absent in the other taxa. to test this, we performed a four way comparative genomic analysis on a database constituted of h. sapiens, s. cerevisiae , a. thaliana  and e. histolytica  proteomes to identify the proteins that are specifically present in opisthokonta and divergent/absent in plantae and in amoebozoa. besides the s. cerevisiae proteome, we chose the proteomes of h. sapiens and a. thaliana because of their similar proteome size and the proteome of e. histolytica as a filter because it is the closest taxa to opisthokonta and has been shown to be monophyletic hence it is divergent enough to obtain significant results 
 <cit> . furthermore its intracellular trafficking is fairly well characterized
 <cit> . each query protein was compared using a reciprocal best blastp hit to the database constituted of the four proteomes and classified in one of the  <dig> possible categories . this led to the identification of  <dig> proteins common to h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae ,  <dig> common to a. thaliana and s. cerevisiae and only  <dig> common to s. cerevisiae and e. histolytica. a. thaliana and h. sapiens, which have a similar proteome size , also have a similar number of proteins in common with s. cerevisiae , whereas baker’s yeast and amoeba  share only  <dig> proteins. the s. cerevisiae gene ontology  annotation database was used to identify the biological processes in which these  <dig> proteins are involved, and the results were verified using the sgd  database . among the  <dig> proteins common to s. cerevisiae and e. histolytica only one biological function, the chitin synthesis of the cell wall, was identified with a p-value below the 10- <dig> threshold and was not retained . the different go functions associated with proteins common to a. thaliana and s. cerevisiae fall into several categories all belonging to metabolism , whereas proteins common to h. sapiens and s. cerevisiae fall into three categories, membrane trafficking, cytokinesis and metabolism . the  <dig> go categories involved in membrane trafficking, the  <dig> in cytokinesis and the  <dig> in metabolism contain  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> different proteins respectively . among the  <dig> identified proteins,  <dig> are absent from our go results of which  <dig> are of unknown function . for the remaining  <dig> proteins that did not form go categories since less than  <dig> proteins shared the same go term, we manually searched the sgd  database and found that  <dig> proteins are involved in membrane trafficking, cytokinesis and/or metabolism and only  <dig> have other functions . thus, the overall analysis of the  <dig> proteins indicates that  <dig> are implicated in membrane trafficking,  <dig> in metabolism and  <dig> in cytokinesis . of the  <dig> proteins involved in membrane trafficking,  <dig> are involved in the endosomal network and  <dig> in secretion . 

it is noteworthy that among the  <dig> proteins,  <dig> proteins share two of the three functions . analysis of these  <dig> proteins shows that  <dig> proteins are involved in membrane trafficking and metabolism,  <dig> in trafficking and cytokinesis but only  <dig> in metabolism and cytokinesis and,  <dig> in the three processes . these results further support the hypothesis according to which membrane trafficking was a key factor in eukaryotic evolution and probably influenced the evolution of the metabolic and cytokinesis functions.

discussion
all eukaryotes share a similar intracellular organization with the nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. thus, they depend on similar requirements to transport newly synthesized proteins from the er to their target organelle. numerous phylogenetic studies have shown that many ubiquitous trafficking effectors, such as small gtpases, syntaxins, coat components or adaptors , the lipid ptdins-kinases and -phosphatases involved in endocytosis and mvb sorting or the c <dig> domain found in many proteins involved in intracellular trafficking, the mabp  domain present in escrt-i/mvb <dig> subunits and in other trafficking proteins and the uma  domain found in regulators of escrt function, are highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic lineage
 <cit> ‐
 <cit> . the enth/anth/vhs superfamily of proteins is involved in three different trafficking pathways i.e. golgi to endosomes, endosomal sorting and endocytic pathways forming the endosomal system. here, we have revealed that although participating in the same pathways as the previously mentioned trafficking proteins, the different members and families of the enth/anth/vhs superfamily do not share the same evolutionary pattern.

our results support the hypothesis that the entha domain is the foundation of the superfamily since it is present in  <dig> out of the  <dig> studied eukaryotic organisms. in the chromista and excavata taxa, this domain is even the unique representative of the enth/anth/vhs function, thus suggesting that, in these organisms, multiple tasks might be performed by the unique entha-containing protein. accordingly, it is to note that, in trypanosoma brucei , the entha-containing protein localizes both as epsinr  and epsin  and is required for endocytosis
 <cit> . in plantae, we could define four different types of entha  . the a. thaliana epsin <dig>  and epsinr2/epsin <dig>  proteins, were linked to functions in the golgi to vacuole pathway
 <cit> . the same could apply for entha <dig>  which is closely related to entha <dig> and entha <dig> in our analysis. we also identified another entha member, the entha <dig> that clusters on another branch  and may represent the epsin required for endocytosis. all these evidences support our hypothesis of a multi-functional role in trafficking for this entha subfamily in organisms lacking the enthb subfamily. the plantae gga and picalm domains diverged early on in at least two branches . the a. thaliana ap <dig>  protein  was shown to be involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and specifically recruited at the plasma membrane upon pdtinsp <dig> production
 <cit> . based on the phylogenetic tree  and on the macs of the full length proteins, this picalm <dig> could be functionally redundant in endocytosis with the picalm4- <dig> proteins , whereas the picalm9- <dig> proteins  that are clustered on a separated branch of the phylogenetic tree might be required for other plant endocytic functions
 <cit> . here, we also show that the plantae, euglenozoa and amoebozoa vhs proteins belong to the gga subfamily, even though they lack the gae c-terminal domain, what led to their classification in the tom subfamily
 <cit> ‐
 <cit> . the biological and trafficking function of the tom proteins are very different from the ones displayed by the gga proteins. indeed, the gga proteins are required for protein sorting at the trans golgi network, via direct binding between their vhs domain and sorting motifs present on the cargos
 <cit> . since plantae gga proteins are clustered in different types, we propose that some perform opisthokonta gga functions, while others mimic the vhs and stam functions that are required for cargo sorting at the endosomes in conjunction with the escrt-i complex and the vps <dig> atpase
 <cit> . the euglenozoa and amoebozoa gga protein could be multifunctional for cargo sorting at the golgi and at the endosomes, since in d. discoidium it interacts with ddtsg <dig> an endosomal escrt-i subunit and with clathrin that is required for golgi trafficking
 <cit> . in conclusion, the large duplication of these three entha, picalm and gga subfamilies in plantae might allow the different subtypes to function at different steps of trafficking, and thus did not require the emergence of other subfamilies. therefore, this study should advance the understanding of the enth/anth/vhs superfamily proteins in plantae and in protists.

our analysis of a large number of fully sequenced genomes representative of the different eukaryotic taxa allowed us to observe a strong correlation between the presence/absence/duplication of members of this superfamily and the eukaryotic evolutionary tree . indeed, most of the different eukaryotic kingdoms  can easily be distinguished based solely on the number of subfamilies populated by at least one protein . only the excavata and chromista kingdoms could not be distinguished from each other having only the entha protein . moreover, among the opisthokonta, animalia and fungi kingdoms can be clustered in two separate groups, based on the presence/absence of the tom subfamily. the tom subfamily as well as the vhs and stam subfamily probably results from the duplication and divergence of the gga subfamily to fulfill the needs of a more complex organelle organization. several in vivo studies on different model organisms have shown that in opisthokonta vesicular budding and cargo sorting at the different steps of the endosomal system requires the combination of two proteins from different enth/anth/vhs subfamilies
 <cit> ‐
 <cit> ). this implies that these partners had to coevolve. this hypothesis is supported by our results showing that the absence of one partner results also in the lack of the other protein, such as the pair enthb/anth or vhs/stam . for most plantae proteins identified in this analysis the biological function is unknown, however a similar pairing rule could apply between the protein types.

our genomic distribution also suggests that membrane trafficking was a driving force for the eukaryotic diversification in different taxa. this hypothesis was tested by comparative genomics and go enrichment analyses and resulted in the identification of membrane trafficking, metabolism and cytokinesis as the only cellular functions differentiating opisthokonta  from plantae  and amoebozoa , only metabolic functions were common to s. cerevisiae and a. thaliana, and none could statistically be considered common to s. cerevisiae and e. histolytica. among the  <dig> proteins identified as opisthokonta specific and involved in trafficking,  <dig> were involved in the endosomal system supporting our hypothesis that this process contributed to the evolution of opisthokonta. it is also noteworthy that of these same  <dig> proteins,  <dig> have overlapping functions in intracellular trafficking and metabolism and  <dig> in intracellular trafficking and cytokinesis, a specificity of opisthokonta. in both cases, the majority of proteins are involved in endosomal network. these results further support the endosomal system as an evolutionary driving force hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, although intracellular trafficking connects the same organelles in all eukaryotes and involves common regulators such as rab gtpases, snares or clathrin, the enth/anth/vhs superfamily shows a distinct distribution between opisthokonta and plantae
 <cit> . furthermore, without being able to assign a function to proteins with a tom domain we could definitely conclude that they are a metazoa specific subfamily of proteins and that entha and gga  and picalm  were present in eukaryotes prior to their evolution in the different taxa. finally, our results show that membrane trafficking was tightly linked to cytokinesis and metabolism in opisthokonta, this strongly supports a central role of membrane trafficking in the formation of the opisthokonta and amoebozoa taxa. this also suggests that membrane trafficking was not only a key acquisition for eukaryogenesis, but was also crucial for the emergence of different eukaryotic taxa, probably by allowing complex innovative metabolic pathways to be organized in compartments to protect cell homeostasis.
