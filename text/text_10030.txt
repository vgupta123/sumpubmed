BACKGROUND
interactions between endosymbionts and insects are widespread in nature  <cit> , and are particularly important in members of the suborder sternorrhyncha such as whiteflies, aphids, psyllids and mealybugs. the ability of these insects to use an unbalanced food source such as plant sap is allowed by the interaction with primary bacterial endosymbionts that complement the diet by providing their host with essential amino acids  <cit> . these primary endosymbionts are confined in specialized host cells, the bacteriocytes, and are strictly vertically transmitted  <cit> , leading to a parallel evolution with their insect hosts for millions of years  <cit> . one evolutionary consequence of this lifestyle is an extreme genome reduction and degradation compared to free living relatives. this convergent evolution has been observed in primary symbionts of many insects, particularly in members of the suborder sternorrhyncha, such as buchnera aphidicola in aphids   <cit> , carsonella ruddii in psyllids   <cit> , portiera aleyrodidarum in whiteflies   <cit> , as well as moranella endobia  and tremblaya princeps  in mealybugs  <cit> .

besides these primary symbionts, insects often harbor secondary symbionts that are not required for their host’s survival or reproduction. nonetheless, they can have broad and important effects on the host biology and ecology, ranging from mutualism to reproductive manipulation, which allow them to spread and be maintained in host populations  <cit> . these secondary symbionts are both vertically and horizontally transmitted  <cit>  and inhabit a variety of tissues, including bacteriocytes. as they are intracellular, secondary symbionts also show a pattern of genome reduction but to a lesser extent than primary symbionts. part of their genome is devoted to the biosynthesis of vitamins and cofactors. for example, hamiltonella defensa in aphids is able to supply all the essential vitamins except for thiamine  and pantothenate   <cit> .

interestingly, recent advances have shown that these secondary or co-resident symbionts can complement the metabolic network of the primary symbionts. for example, the pair of endosymbionts carsonella eucalypti  and heteropsylla cubana  in psyllids exhibits strict complementarity in the biosynthesis of tryptophan  <cit> , as is also the case in the aphid cinara cedri where serratia complements lineage specific gene losses of the primary endosymbiont buchnera  <cit> . similarly, the primary endosymbiont sulcia muelleri supplies most of the essential amino acids to its hosts while the remaining ones are provided by different co-resident symbionts: baumannia cicadellinicola in sharpshooters, hodgkinia cicadicola in cicadas, zinderia insecticola in spittlebugs and nasuia deltocephalinicola in leafhoppers  <cit> . furthermore, “candidatus moranella endobia” and “candidatus tremblaya princeps” contribute to intermediate steps of the pathways for the synthesis of amino acids  <cit> . these insects must thus be seen as holobionts where the full community of organisms inhabiting a host must be taken into account to understand its phenotype, including its metabolic capabilities  <cit> . interestingly, comparative genomics has revealed that these losses are generally specific to some lineages of primary endosymbionts, suggesting that the ancestor was performing the lost function. the most probable evolutionary scenario is as follows. co-infection between the primary and the secondary symbiont preceded the function loss, generating a redundancy of some metabolic functions. as selection acts at the level of the holobiont, any loss of a metabolic function in only one symbiotic partner is neutral  <cit> . such losses in essential functions might thus lead to the observed pattern of complementation and to the inter-dependency between the symbiotic partners.

one interesting case for investigating metabolic complementation within symbiotic communities is the whitefly bemisia tabaci gennadius . this whitefly is a complex of at least  <dig> cryptic species that differ in many ecological respects, including their potential for causing damage. some of them are serious destructive pests of agricultural, horticultural and ornamental crops with worldwide distribution  <cit> . this phloem-feeding insect harbors the primary bacterial symbiont “candidatus portiera aleyrodidarum”  that is located within bacteriocytes  <cit> , as well as a variety of secondary symbionts  <cit> . portiera is an ancient symbiont of whiteflies, acquired 100- <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the recent sequencing of two genomes of portiera for the mediterranean  species and two for the middle east asia minor  <dig>  species of b. tabaci indicate that this symbiont not only synthesizes essential amino acids but could also protect its host against oxidative stress by supplying carotenoids  <cit> . another remarkable feature of these genomes is their extreme reduction with a size ranging from  <dig> to 358 kb, which is intermediate between those observed for classical primary symbionts and the most reduced ones. such reduction opens widely the possibility that secondary symbionts complement some metabolic functions of portiera. in whiteflies, secondary symbionts have been reported to affect the life parameters of their host including virus transmission  <cit> , resistance to natural enemies like parasitic wasps  <cit> , heat stress  <cit>  and insecticides  <cit> . until now, at least seven secondary symbionts of whitefly have been reported in b. tabaci, including hamiltonella , arsenophonus , wolbachia , rickettisia , cardinium , fritschea  and hemipteriphilus   <cit> . they have different patterns of localization but all of them share bacteriocytes with portiera. these frequent infections with secondary symbionts in addition to portiera make b. tabaci an interesting model to investigate metabolic complementation within symbiotic communities. moreover, two of them, hamiltonella and arsenophonus, reach almost fixation when present in the insect populations, but they have never yet been found together within the same host individual  <cit> . in addition, hamiltonella was recently found to provide fitness advantage under nutritional stress conditions, making it a good candidate for analyzing complementation in b. tabaci  <cit> .

among the b. tabaci species complex, the meam <dig> and the med species are the most widespread and economically important. over the last twenty years, they have spread rapidly to more than eighty countries over six continents, highlighting their ability to adapt to various environments, and caused serious economic damages worldwide  <cit> . while meam <dig> is notorious for its survivability under extreme conditions, med is highly resistant to some classes of pesticides, especially neonicotinoids  <cit> . interestingly, hamiltonella has so far only been detected in these two species of b. tabaci.

the aim of the present study was to acquire, analyze and study the genome sequences of hamiltonella and portiera. most often b. tabaci individuals harbor more than one secondary symbiont species, which can lead to complex interactions  <cit> . here, we used a natural line belonging to the med species that only harbors hamiltonella in addition to portiera. the data obtained provide insights into the dynamics and evolution of symbiont genomes in intracellular ecosystems, and the mechanisms involved in the interactions among the symbiotic partners, especially in terms of metabolic complementation. they confirm that complementation in whiteflies is an on-going process, and that the co-evolution of different symbiotic partners can lead to inter-dependency.

RESULTS
isolation of endosymbionts and dna amplification
pcrs performed using specific primers of portiera, hamiltonella, cardinium, wolbachia, rickettsia, arsenophonus and hemipteriphilus confirmed that the med line used in this study only harbors portiera and hamiltonella . in addition, fluorescence in situ hybridization  revealed that hamiltonella shares bacteriocytes with porteria in this line, and disperses in the cytoplasm of bacteriocytes , as already observed  <cit> . this contrasts with the situation observed in the aphid acyrthosiphon pisum where hamiltonella, is localized within sheath cells and do not share the same bacteriocytes with buchnera  <cit> . this suggests that the two endosymbionts in med whiteflies have a more intimate relationship. the endosymbionts were isolated by micromanipulation from a single bacteriocyte cell. bacterial dna was amplified by multiple displacement amplification. diagnostic pcrs were then performed using specific primers to test for the presence of the endosymbiont dna and the absence of host nuclear dna contamination .figure  <dig>

sequencing and general features of the portiera and hamitonella genomes
amplified symbiotic dna was sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> sequencer and the genomes of both portiera and hamiltonella were independently assembled. the main features for these assemblies are summarized in table  <dig>  the genome of portiera was assembled into a single contig. it has the classical characteristics of primary endosymbionts: a biased a + t content of  <dig> % with a reduced genome , but which does not reach the smaller sizes reported to date, such as for the genomes of nasuia deltocephalinic ola , tremblaya princeps , hodgkinia cicadicola , carsonella ruddii , zinderia insecticola  and sulcia muelleri , uzinura diaspidicola    <cit> . despite its reduced size, this genome has a relatively low percentage of coding dna , which is much less than the coding density of buchnera in aphids . large intergenic regions have been shown to represent an important substrate for genome rearrangements in portiera  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were predicted in the portiera genome, and  <dig> % of them  have homologs present in genbank. the genome encodes three rrna genes , two non-coding rnas  and  <dig> trna genes including at least one for each of the  <dig> amino acids , as observed in the two other assembled portiera genomes of the med whitefly species and the two genomes of portiera in the meam <dig> whitefly species  <cit> . the gene content is the same in all deposited genomes, the differences being only due to variations in the annotations and pseudogene detection parameters.table  <dig>

the draft genome of hamiltonella in this med line has an approximate size of  <dig> ,792 bp with an average g + c content of  <dig> % and comprises  <dig> large scaffolds  with a n <dig> size of approximately  <dig>  kb. as only one bacteriocyte was used for bacterial dna extraction and amplification, the incompleteness of the hamiltonella genome is probably due to the bias during pcr. the genome encodes a total of  <dig>  putative cdss for which  <dig> %  can be assigned to a putative biological function. a total of  <dig> trna genes including at least one for all of the  <dig> amino acids and five small rnas were predicted . the average coding gene identity with h. defensa hd-ap is very high . globally, the general features of this genome are very similar to those of other genomes of secondary symbionts.

functional annotation of the genomes of portiera and hamiltonella and metabolic reconstruction
protein-coding genes of portiera and hamiltonella were classified into clusters of orthologous groups   <cit> . a total of  <dig> portiera genes and  <dig>  hamiltonella genes were assigned to cogs . the three most prominently represented cog categories in the portiera genome are “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis”, “amino acid transport and metabolism”, and “energy production and conversion” . these cog categories are essential for cellular metabolism of primary endosymbionts. conversely, genes related to “rna processing and modification”, “chromatin structure and dynamics”, “cell motility and signal transduction mechanisms”  are absent from portiera. in hamiltonella, several cog categories are prominently represented, namely “translation ribosomal structure and biogenesis”, “replication, recombination and repair”, and “cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis”  .

the metabolic networks of the two symbionts were reconstructed and used to identify the sources needed by each symbiont . portiera needs  <dig> different sources to produce less than  <dig> metabolites, while hamiltonella needs  <dig> sources for less than  <dig> metabolites , which conforms with the expectation of a more reduced and more host-dependent metabolism in this primary endosymbiont than in hamiltonella. while most of these sources might be provided by the host, the metabolism of hamiltonella needs some sources which would be only synthesized by portiera. aroa is a 3-phosphoshikimate-1-carboxyvinyltransferase involved in the sixth step of the chorismate pathway, leading to the production of 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate. a mutation in the aroa gene, determined by the in silico analysis, and later confirmed by sanger sequencing on independent samples  suggests that 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate is a source for the hamiltonella metabolism. portiera can produce this source and probably export it to the secondary endosymbiont. nevertheless, tamas et al.  <cit>  reported that a point mutation in a polya tract can be rescued by transcriptional slippage and result in some functional protein. as the mutation of whitefly aroa gene is also present in the polya tract  and aroa is intact in the hamiltonella from a. pisum  <cit> , whether the whitefly aroa gene is functional or not warrants further investigation.table  <dig>

among sources provided by the host, hydrogen sulfide is of particular interest. indeed, while the two symbionts of the med whitefly lack the whole gene sets for sulfur metabolism , cysn/cysc , cysq  and cysj  of this pathway have been identified in the whitefly transcriptome  <cit> . it suggests that the host whitefly or its gut microbiota might help the symbionts for sulfate reduction. notably, the sulfate reduction pathway can transform sulfate into hydrogen sulfide, a precursor for the cysteine synthesis pathway present in hamiltonella .figure  <dig>

essential amino acid synthesis depends on within-pathway complementation between symbionts
a major metabolic contribution of symbionts in phloemophagous insects concerns the synthesis of essential amino acids. as highlighted by the cog analysis, some metabolic functions related to the biosynthesis of amino-acids have been retained in the highly reduced genome of portiera, which contains  <dig> genes dedicated to this function . portiera is therefore able to synthesize or to participate in the synthesis of several amino acids, and especially essential ones, like other primary endosymbionts . these results further demonstrate the evolutionary convergence between symbionts from distinct phylogenetic lineages hosted by hosts with similar diets  <cit> .

however, portiera has only two complete pathways for the synthesis of essential amino-acids   <cit> . interestingly, some of the missing genes in these pathways are present in the hamiltonella genome . for example, aspc, a gene encoding an enzyme required for the phenylalanine synthesis, is missing in the genome of portiera but is encoded by hamiltonella. furthermore, the genome of portiera lacks three enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lysine, namely dapf, lysa, which are absent, and dapb which is pseudogenized, while hamiltonella possesses all of these genes but lacks the argd gene in the same pathway . as for chorismate in hamiltonella, the production of lysine has only been recently lost in portiera, since the entire pathway is present and intact in the portiera of trialeurodes vaporariorum, another member of aleyrodidae  <cit> . this is consistent with the hypothesis that acquisition of secondary endosymbionts generates metabolic redundancies with the primary endosymbiont, leading to specific gene losses in both genomes  <cit> . these losses, if they affect essential functions ancestrally performed by the primary endosymbiont, can rapidly make secondary endosymbionts indispensable for the holobiont  <cit> . nevertheless, the functions of aspc in portiera and argd in hamiltonella could also be performed by other aminotransferases encoded by their respective genomes, an unknown enzyme, or by an already known enzyme which would have changed or extended its prior function, as has already been proposed for other symbiotic genes  <cit> . interestingly, the lysine  and phenylalanine  pathways are often incomplete in the genomes of primary endosymbionts, and have been proposed to be in some cases complemented by the host or co-symbiont .

the host itself could also provide enzymes for completing some pathways, as has been recently shown in aphids where the host metabolism has been redirected to complement some missing reactions for amino acid synthesis in buchnera  <cit> , similar to what has been hypothesized to occur in the mealybugs and psyllids  <cit> . for example, it has been hypothesized that phloem-feeder hosts encode a homolog of the aspc gene allowing the production of phenylalanine  <cit> . the same situation might apply to b. tabaci med for the synthesis of valine, leucine and isoleucine, for which ilve, the gene encoding the common last enzyme of these pathways is absent from the genomes of both portiera and hamiltonella and has been found in the transcriptome of the med whitefly  <cit> .

the case of the histidine synthesis pathway is different because the genes which are not present in the genome of portiera  are neither present in the hamiltonella’s genome , nor have been detected in the whitefly’s transcriptome  <cit> . this suggests that histidine may be provided by the food. this hypothesis is relevant since previous studies indicated that this essential amino acid is present in high concentration in the phloem sap  <cit> . finally, some genes involved in the synthesis of non-essential amino acids like serine and proline are missing in the genomes of both endosymbionts, but can be identified in the sequences obtained from the med transcriptome  <cit> . this highlights the fact that gene losses in the symbiotic genomes can also occur when some functional redundancies exist with the host’s genome.

portiera and hamiltonella synthesize different vitamins and cofactors
other types of metabolites frequently provided by the symbionts in sap-feeding insects are vitamins and cofactors. portiera lacks almost all the genes involved in the synthesis of vitamins and cofactors . however, portiera is the first symbiont reported to be able to produce carotenoids  <cit> . interestingly, a thorough blast search of the whitefly transcriptome  <cit>  suggested that the insect cannot synthesize carotenoids, unlike aphids  <cit> . conversely, hamiltonella possesses a number of gene sets  dedicated to vitamin production, which include riboflavin , nad, pyridoxine , biotin , folic acid  . however, it is unable to produce thiamine  and pantothenic acid  and, in the med transcriptome, we did not find any genes except panc for synthesizing the two missing vitamins, suggesting that whiteflies might capture thiamine and pantothenic acid from the phloem sap. because the med transcriptome was sequenced using the whole whitefly  <cit> , whether the panc gene is laterally acquired by the whitefly or produced by other symbionts  within the whitefly is still unknown.

transport capabilities in link with exchanged metabolites
as revealed by previous analyses, the metabolic networks of both endosymbionts could be highly intertwined requiring efficient transport systems of metabolites. compared to secondary symbionts, primary symbionts lack many genes for environmental information processing, such as membrane transport and signal transduction . in addition, most primary endosymbionts have kept only a few transporter systems although metabolite fluxes are required within the symbiotic system  <cit> . indeed, the metabolism of portiera needs amino acid, nucleic acid and isoprenoid uptake . moreover, the products of the metabolism of portiera  need also to be exported to the host.

however, the genome of portiera encodes only eleven putative inner-membrane-located transporters . as the gene content of portiera has quite not changed since the last ancestor between the obligate endosymbionts of b. tabaci and t. vaporarium  <cit> , this suggests an ancient loss of transporters. the low number of transporters is of the same order of magnitude as in buchnera cc , the symbiont of cinara cedri, and less than half of the number of transporters identified in other buchnera genomes   <cit> . different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the weak number of transporters in buchnera cc  <cit> . first, this could be linked to the strong specialization of the aphid host of this symbiont , but in our case, the large plant spectrum of b. tabaci is not consistent with this hypothesis. second, the presence of general transporters with low affinity with the substrates, or the recruitment of transporters from the host, could compensate the losses. for example, aphid glnt <dig> which transports glutamine is located in the bacteriocyte membrane instead of the symbiosomal membrane  <cit> .

in addition, this reduction of the ancestral transporter stock can be explained by the small number of classes of chemical compounds transported by portiera. its genome encodes exporters/importers for all of these classes, excepted sugars, but as it is expected in buchnera cc, portiera probably acquires them by passive diffusion  <cit> . for example, it encodes a gltp proton dependent transporter involved in escherichia coli in the uptake of aspartate  <cit> , a probable source of the portiera metabolism. in addition, this transporter could also allow the uptake of the other required amino acids . another transporter is argo, which is normally involved in arginine export  <cit> . interestingly, arginine is no more synthesized by portiera from b. tabaci, and consequently, argo could have no more roles, or could be involved in the export of other essential amino acids synthesized by the endosymbiont. finally, the best hits of btqp_ <dig>  are dite-like genes of pseudomonas spp. the dite permease could be involved in diterpenoid transport  <cit> . thus, this transporter could be a putative candidate for the uptake of isoprenoid sources  and the export of carotenoids.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of the metabolic pathways in portiera and hamiltonella revealed the interdependency between two partners engaged in a mutualistic relationship. first, while the two partners depend principally on sources coming from the host diet and metabolism, they could also rely on some sources they provide to each other. second, although portiera encodes a large number of genes in the biosynthesis of essential amino-acids, it lacks almost all genes required for the synthesis of cofactors, while the latter are likely to be produced by hamiltonella. third, and in addition to this complementarity in terms of provided-sources and metabolites, some strict within-pathway complementation cases have been inferred by our in silico analysis, which concern two essential amino acids . these results suggest that hamiltonella could be a primary partner of the consortium, and could functionally explain the recent results showing the benefit it provides under nutritional stress conditions  <cit> , and allow its fixation within populations. interestingly, hamiltonella probably replaced the primary endosymbiont for some functions that are still assumed by portiera in other species of b. tabaci. as hamiltonella is probably a recent symbiont of bemisia, it appears that both symbionts have been caught in the act of a switch towards reciprocal complementation. emergence of dependence between the symbiotic partners is rather due to metabolic redundancies which have been eliminated, a phenomenon that led to an apparent mutualism. nevertheless, all of these postulations are based on the analysis of portiera and hamiltonella draft genomes. in order to confirm this scenario and gain insights into the evolutionary dynamics and history of these interactions, this analysis should be extended to other populations of med species associated with arsenophonus, and to other species of b. tabaci. this could allow determining when and in which b. tabaci species portiera lost some key elements for the holobiont functioning, and whether some secondary endosymbionts only replaced these functions, or widened the initial niche of the holobiont, making it less dependent on specific environmental sources for some metabolites.
