BACKGROUND
although the evolution of reproductive isolation has been a focus of intense interest since the birth of the modern synthesis, its quantification is often not a trivial exercise. among animal taxa, most research effort has focused on drosophila  <cit> , birds  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , and fish  <cit> . in gastropod mollusks, the mechanisms of reproductive isolation have been elucidated only in the marine prosobranch snail littorina  <cit> , opisthobranch sea slugs  <cit> , certain terrestrial  pulmonates  <cit> , and in the freshwater  pulmonates that will be the focus of the present work.

the barriers to reproduction that may evolve between a pair of populations have customarily been divided into prezygotic and postzygotic components, both of which are typically inherited in a complex and polygenic fashion. coyne  <cit>  reported that the shortened copulations observed between drosophila simulans and d. mauritiana, for example, are controlled by genes on all three major chromosomes, the two autosomes more important than the x chromosome. with regard to postzygotic reproductive isolation, experiments with f <dig> backcrosses among drosophila species have consistently demonstrated that hybrid sterility is attributable to genes on every arm of every chromosome  <cit> . presgraves  <cit>  estimated approximately  <dig> hybrid-lethal incompatibilities between d. melanogaster and d. simulans. thirteen loci in seven linkage groups were implicated in the origin of postzygotic isolation speciation among lake whitefish by rogers and bernatchez  <cit> .

a positive correlation has often been documented between degree of reproductive isolation and overall genetic divergence  <cit> . this relationship was first demonstrated in the d. willistoni species complex of south america by ayala et al.  <cit>  using variation at allozyme-encoding loci, and has since been confirmed in drosophila generally  <cit> , lepidoptera  <cit> , fish  <cit> , amphibians  <cit> , and birds  <cit> . most of these studies have focused on postzygotic reproductive isolation, which tends to evolve more slowly than prezygotic isolation  <cit> . although a lag is generally noted between the accumulation of genetic differences and the onset of reproductive barriers in these studies  <cit> , the temporal relationship between genetic divergence and reproductive isolation seems sufficiently predictable to prompt theoretical exploration of a "speciation clock"  <cit> .

since the advent of modern molecular methods for phylogenetic reconstruction, increased attention has turned toward the detailed correspondence between gene trees and the reproductive relationships among the populations from which marker genes have been sampled. as might be expected from the complex and polygenic nature of reproductive barriers, however, their correlation with any single gene or small number of genes arbitrarily selected to reconstruct a population phylogeny under the neutral model may be poor  <cit> . in both the d. melanogaster and d. willistoni species groups, for example, genes sampled from narrowly restricted but reproductively isolated species nest within the branches of gene trees constructed from their more widely-dispersed progenitors, rendering the ancestor species paraphyletic  <cit> . in the group of d. pseudoobscura, none of  <dig> genes sampled from 10- <dig> individuals unambiguously returned the known reproductive relationships among three populations, relative to an outgroup  <cit> . such discrepancies have led some systematists to endorse "phylogenetic" species concepts based not on reproductive isolation, but rather on the evolutionary history of marker genes  <cit> .

the purpose of the work we present here is to examine the origin of reproductive isolation in a simultaneous hermaphrodite from a phylogenetic perspective. we focus on freshwater pulmonate snails of the genus physa, which by virtue of their reproductive plasticity, ease of culture, and availability of genetic markers have become important models for the study of mating systems generally  <cit> . the best-known species is physa acuta, apparently a north american native introduced to europe in the early nineteenth century and subsequently spread to six continents  <cit> . in cultured populations, male fertility develops around  <dig> weeks post-hatch, and female fertility is added around week  <dig>  with the onset of self-fertilization around week  <dig>  if no partner is supplied  <cit> . however, the reductions in parental fecundity and f <dig> viability engendered by self-fertilization seem to select strongly for outcrossing  <cit> .

north america is also home to approximately ten lesser-known species in the family physidae, differing from p. acuta by reproductive anatomy, habitat, and minor aspects of shell morphology  <cit> . swamps and ditches in the southeastern united states are inhabited by physa carolinae, bearing a darker and more slender shell than p. acuta, and river margins are inhabited by physa pomilia, reaching adulthood at a smaller size  <cit> . both p. carolinae and p. pomilia have two-part penial sheaths, with a larger muscular portion and a smaller glandular portion, while the penial sheath of p. acuta is not subdivided. further north, more stable freshwater environments are inhabited by physa gyrina, distinguished by a two-part penial sheath with approximately equal glandular and muscular portions  <cit> .

in recent years substantial research effort has been directed toward quantifying the reproductive isolation among north american physid populations. the experimental tools available are directly analogous to the "mate-choice" and "no-choice" tests that have become established by common practice with dioecious animals displaying obligate sexual reproduction  <cit> , slightly modified in their interpretation for hermaphrodites.

physa mate-choice tests have been modelled closely on the experimental design used with drosophila in population cages for many years  <cit> . such methods have been applied to examine specific relationships in the freshwater pulmonate snail biomphalaria  <cit>  and in land snails  <cit> , as well as in the dioecious prosobranch snail littorina  <cit> . although physa are simultaneously hermaphroditic, copulation is unidirectional, with prospective partners typically vying to assume the male role. the complex behaviors documented in pairs of mating physids  <cit>  have been attributed both to sexual conflict  and to gender conflict . thus while the reproductive relationships among pairs of physid populations can be quantified using standard mate-choice statistics, each datum is not a "choice" in any sense, but rather the outcome of a contest. any consistent approach to scoring that outcome yielding a single observation per individual might be employed.

the use of no-choice tests to evaluate reproductive isolation was also pioneered with fruit flies  <cit>  and such techniques have been used to explore specific relationships in the freshwater pulmonate snail bulinus  <cit>  and in the marine prosobranch lacuna  <cit> . but the interpretation of such experiments is again somewhat ambiguous in hermaphrodites such as physa, since any individual snail always has a "choice" to outcross with the single partner provided or to self-fertilize. thus in addition to comparing the fertility and fecundity of outcrossed pairs to their corresponding incross controls, the hybridity of first-generation progeny must be confirmed using genetic markers, and any offspring of self-fertilization subtracted.

here we report an expansion of our previous work to include both mate-choice and no-choice tests among all pairs of p. acuta, p. carolinae, p. pomilia and p. gyrina. we add a second population of p. acuta to test for discrepancies due to paraphyly, such as have been the concern of the proponents of phylogenetic species concepts. the results of these  <dig> possible pairwise comparisons are then cast into a phylogenic framework  using the mtdna sequence data of wethington and lydeard  <cit>  and wethington et al.  <cit> . by this approach we are able to infer the relative rates of evolution for hybrid sterility, hybrid inviability, and sexual incompatibility.

RESULTS
sexual isolation
as has previously been documented  <cit> , our approach of rearing snails to adulthood in isolation before initiating mate-choice tests seemed to yield many animals eager to copulate in the male role, while rejective in the female role. we typically observed a high frequency of mating activity over the six hours of each trial, each snail often involved in multiple copulations. across the ten pairwise comparisons of our five populations, the minimum number of initial copulations as male observed was  <dig>  and the median  <dig>  of  <dig> possible .

values of the ipsi statistic testing for sexual isolation between all pairs of populations are given below the diagonal of table  <dig>  no sexual isolation was demonstrated in pairings among physa carolinae and physa acuta , all copulations involving those three comparisons appearing indiscriminate. our experiments did generally detect significant sexual isolation between populations of the acuta/carolinae group and both physa pomilia and p. gyrina. the exception was the acuta-p × pomilia comparison, where  <dig> of the  <dig> initial copulations of philadelphia acuta as males were with pomilia as females, and  <dig> of the  <dig> initial copulations of pomilia as males were with acuta as females, yielding an ipsi statistic near zero.

hybridization
example results from one of our no-choice experiments and its corresponding pair of controls are shown in figure  <dig>  parental survivorship was excellent in this set of  <dig> pairs, as was generally observed through the duration of all experiments and controls reported here, only one pair of parents failing to survive the  <dig> weeks of observation. in this case the pomilia controls initiated reproduction at an earlier week  than either the acuta-p controls or the acuta-p × pomilia outcross experiment, the three-pair threshold being reached at week  <dig> for pomilia, but week  <dig> for acuta-p and acuta-p × pomilia. then through the ten subsequent weeks, figure  <dig> demonstrates that parental fecundity was greatest in the pomilia control, lowest in the acuta-p control, and intermediate in the outcross experiment, with the survivorship of the f <dig> hatchlings roughly comparable in all three cases. oviposition was ultimately observed in  <dig> outcross pairs,  <dig> control acuta-p pairs, and all  <dig> control pomilia pairs.

age of first parental reproduction, parental fecundity, and the yield of viable f <dig> hatchlings in all no choice experiments across all three years of experimentation are compared with their corresponding controls in table  <dig>  note that statistics shown in the lower half of each table section should be compared to the corresponding controls leftward of the dot, and statistics in the upper half of each section to corresponding controls right of the dot. we were unable to confirm any outcross progeny among the f <dig> recovered from five no-choice experiments - the four involving physa gyrina and the one pairing p. carolinae with p. pomilia. allozyme electrophoretic analysis of the first generation progeny recovered from these sets of outcross pairs revealed all reproduction to have been the result of self-fertilization by the non-gyrina parent in the acuta-p × gyrina and carolinae × gyrina experiments, as was previously reported in the acuta-c × gyrina experiment by dillon et al.  <cit> . only the carolinae parent reproduced in the carolinae × pomilia experiment. both parents self-fertilized to produce the first generation offspring recovered from the pomilia × gyrina experiment.

m mixtures of selfed and outcross progeny.

two sets of no-choice mating experiments yielded f <dig> progeny that proved to result from mixtures of outcrossing and self-fertilization - the crosses of physa pomilia with physa acuta from both philadelphia and charleston . parents in the acuta-p × pomilia experiment exhibited a significant delay in reproduction , although no such phenomenon was detected in the acuta-c × pomilia experiment . nor was any significant reduction apparent in mean parental fecundity  or the combined survivorship of the  f <dig> progeny  from either outcross experiment. nevertheless, a fixed difference at the lap locus allowed dillon et al.  <cit>  to unambiguously classify  <dig> f <dig> progeny analyzed from the acuta-c × pomilia experiment as 25% self-acuta, 25% self-pomilia and 50% outcrossed. polymorphisms at the lap, isdh, est <dig> and pgm loci permitted us to classify  <dig> f <dig> progeny recovered from the acuta-p × pomilia experiment  as 25% self-acuta, 56% self-pomilia, and 19% outcrossed.

our second generation observations further suggested that the subsets of hybrid progeny recovered from both of the acuta × pomilia outcross experiments may have been sterile. only four of the nine f <dig> × f <dig> pairs from the acuta-c × pomilia experiment yielded any viable second generation progeny after  <dig> weeks of observation, all four of which were subsequently revealed by allozyme analysis to have involved selfed f <dig> animals  <cit> . six of the nine f <dig> × f <dig> pairs tested from the acuta-p × pomilia experiment ultimately yielded viable progeny in the second generation, the slightly higher proportion attributable to the lower proportion of hybrids among the f <dig> 

allozyme analysis confirmed that the three remaining no-choice experiments  yielded entirely hybrid f <dig> progeny, with viabilities intermediate between their two corresponding incross controls . all nine of the f <dig> × f <dig> crosses from the acuta-c × acuta-p experiment yielded viable f <dig> progeny, with no apparent delay in reproduction  <cit> . although oviposition was noted in six of the nine f <dig> × f <dig> pairs from the acuta-p × carolinae experiment, however, only one pair yielded viable second generation progeny over  <dig> weeks of observation. and none of the nine f <dig> × f <dig> pairs tested from the acuta-c × carolinae experiment yielded any viable f <dig> offspring over  <dig> weeks of observation, although again, oviposition was observed in  <dig> pairs  <cit> . it would appear that acuta x carolinae hybrids are almost entirely sterile.

molecular phylogeny
the strict consensus tree from our phylogenetic analysis of mtdna sequence divergence is shown in figure 2a, branch lengths scaled by neighbor-joining. of the  <dig> characters on which this tree was based,  <dig> were variable and parsimony-informative, and  <dig> were variable but uninformative. this simplified tree agrees well with the more comprehensive phylogenies published by wethington and lydeard  <cit>  and wethington et al.  <cit> , physa acuta and p. carolinae being depicted as sister taxa, with p. pomilia their most immediate joint ancestor, and p. gyrina more distant, given aplexa as an outgroup.

discussion
although it is not conceptually difficult to model the process of biological speciation as a phylogenetic tree, graphically the exercise may pose substantial challenges. this is because the data are relational. reproductive isolation is not a character that can be attributed to a population, but rather can only be measured among pairs of populations.

at both the finest level and at the most coarse, however, the observations we report here on reproductive isolation among our five physa populations match the consensus gene tree returned by our phylogenetic analysis unambiguously. mitochondrial genes sequenced from individuals sampled from our two p. acuta populations were the most similar molecularly, and those two populations displayed no reproductive isolation detectable by our methods. and our p. gyrina population was the most reproductively isolated of the five populations we examined, and contained the two individuals whose mtdna sequence was the most divergent in our molecular phylogeny. no viable hybrids were produced when gyrina was paired with any other population; individual p. gyrina strongly preferred to copulate among themselves if offered a choice.

a simple model for the evolution of f <dig> infertility among the four populations from which any bona fide hybrids were recovered is offered in figure 2c. this process can be cast directly on the gene tree  by assuming a single compatibility locus, with some unique allele for incompatibility evolving on two separate occasions.

at intermediate levels of population divergence, however, the correspondence between our gene tree and the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms is less clear. for while the cross of carolinae to acuta  yielded 100% hybrids in high frequencies, and the cross of pomilia to acuta  yielded hybrids in reduced frequencies , no viable carolinae × pomilia hybrids were recovered. no rearrangement of the phylogeny implied by our gene tree can account for such observations using a single factor. similarly, our mate-choice data do not cast easily onto the gene tree phylogeny at intermediate levels of divergence. for although we detected significant sexual isolation between the acuta/carolinae group and both pomilia and gyrina in almost all combinations, populations of p. acuta from philadelphia and p. pomilia seemed to copulate freely.

in figure 2b we offer a two-locus model that might account for our observations on hybridization among our five populations of physa. we postulate a "complete" locus j and a "partial" locus k, at which unique compatibility alleles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  ... may segregate. locus j is epistatic over locus k in our model, such that hybrids homozygous at the j locus are always completely viable, regardless of genotype at locus k, but j heterozygotes may show either partial viability  or complete inviability . thus from a j1k <dig> ancestor, gyrina might be modelled as fixed for j2k <dig>  pomilia might be j3k <dig>  carolinae might be j1k <dig>  and both acuta populations retain the ancestral j1k <dig> genotype. interaction between a pair of genes in this fashion would be consistent with the classic dobzhansky-muller model of speciation  <cit> . we emphasize that we have no data directly bearing on the genetics of reproductive isolation in physa, however, and that other models might be offered to fit our observations on hybrid viability equally well.

nor can any single-factor model account for our observations on prezygotic reproductive isolation among our five populations of physa. but again, a two-locus model such as that offered in figure 2d would account for our observations, consistent with the gene tree. here we postulate two complementary loci j and k, with unique compatibility alleles  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ..., a match at one locus being sufficient for sexual compatibility. then from a j1k <dig> ancestor, under our model gyrina might be j2k <dig>  pomilia might be j3k <dig>  carolinae might be j1k <dig>  acuta-c might be j1k <dig>  and acuta-p might retain the ancestral genotype j1k <dig> 

our observations are consistent with at least one generalization that has emerged from comparative studies of speciation in many other groups of organisms - that hybrid sterility evolves faster than hybrid inviability  <cit> . while hybrids between acuta and carolinae were entirely viable, and hybrids between acuta and pomilia partially so, the measured levels of fertility in all these hybrid classes were effectively nil. regarding the relative rates of evolution for hybrid inviability and sexual incompatibility, our results seem to favor a slightly earlier appearance of the latter. although neither form of reproductive isolation appeared effective at the branch between carolinae and the charleston/philadelphia acuta ancestor, our observations at the branch between pomilia and the joint acuta/carolinae ancestor suggest that evolution at one  locus for sexual compatibility may have occurred only quite recently.

taken together, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that speciation between p. acuta and p. pomilia may have been reinforced by natural selection for prezygotic isolating mechanisms  <cit> . although p. acuta ranges throughout north america, p. pomilia seems more common and widespread in the american southeast. in the charleston area populations of both species are not uncommonly sympatric, especially in the backwaters or margins of slow-moving rivers. we are not aware of any populations of p. pomilia in the vicinity of philadelphia, however. given the significant delay in reproduction we documented in the acuta-p/pomilia outcross experiment , the high frequency of selfed progeny among their f <dig> , and the apparent sterility suffered by their hybrids, one might expect selection for prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms in sympatry, such as those returned from our mate-choice experiments between pomilia and charleston acuta . but the evolution of prezygotic isolation would seem less likely between pomilia and allopatric philadelphia acuta, where no such selection may have taken place.

although tabulated as "choices," the primary data we recorded from our mate-choice tests were each the outcome of a contest  <cit> . the  <dig> copulations we observed in the acuta-c × pomilia test included just  <dig> heterogametic pairings, equally split by gender -  <dig> with charleston acuta serving as the female and  <dig> with pomilia the female  <cit> . the  <dig> copulations we observed in the acuta-p × pomilia test included  <dig> heterogametic pairings, also evenly split by gender. thus our data contain no overt evidence of differing selection regimes in the p. acuta populations of philadelphia and charleston. and it must be emphasized that a variety of explanations other than reinforcement have been offered to account for differing degrees of prezygotic reproduction among species in sympatry and allopatry  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our observations on the evolution of reproductive isolation in our five populations of physa can be modelled with five genes - two loci for sexual compatibility, two loci for hybridization, and one locus for f <dig> fertility. the trees depicting evolution at these five loci  are consistent with the gene tree shown in figure 2a.

we note, however, that some confusion has arisen in recent years over the term, "species tree. "although the concept has an old history, "species tree" was brought into modern prominence by maddison  <cit>  to distinguish a phylogeny based on genes  from the true evolutionary history of a set of populations, which he called a "species tree. "although the example postulated by maddison  implied reproductive isolation, the processes he highlighted that might lead to discord  would apply to any set of populations regardless of their reproductive relationships. thus many subsequent workers  have used the term "species tree" as a synonym for "population tree."

but biological species are typically composed of more than one population, and the complex reproductive relationships among a set of populations will have their own evolutionary history, independent of  both the true historical relationships of the population tree and whatever molecular markers systematic biologists might find convenient to construct gene trees. we would suggest that the term "species tree" be reserved for figures conveying the evolution of reproductive isolation, such as those shown on figures 2b, c and 2d, and that the term "population tree" be applied by workers such as maddison. and then under the narrower definition adopted here, gene trees correspond to species trees in the freshwater snail, physa.
