BACKGROUND
quantitative trait loci  modulating lung tumor size have been mapped in mouse models  <cit> . lung tumor size, a marker of lung tumor progression in mice, can be expressed as several quantitative traits, including mean tumor volume, total tumor volume or tumor multiplicity . one locus specifically modulating mean lung tumor volume in mice, called pulmonary adenoma progression  <dig> , has been mapped to a wide region of chromosome  <dig> included between d4mit <dig>  and d4mit <dig> , using an intercross between the balb/c and swr/j strains  <cit> . in that study, we observed that animals receiving the balb/c-derived allele had a ~10-fold greater mean lung tumor volume than those receiving the swr/j-derived allele  <cit> .

the fine mapping of loci affecting a phenotype may be achieved using recombinant inbred  strains that are generated by crossing two known inbred strains and then inbreeding their descendants. several ri strains have been developed as mouse models with the aim of mapping different quantitative phenotypes, including lung tumor susceptibility  <cit> . such an approach is advantageous, since only a single cross is needed and since ri strains may undergo more recombination in the critical qtl interval than a standard intercross population does. the availability of ri strains between balb/c and swr/j mice would facilitate the characterization of the papg <dig> locus. in absence of such strains, we considered the series of  <dig> ri strains between balb/c and c57bl/ <dig> mice, called cxb. c57bl/ <dig> mice carry a null allele at the papg <dig> locus, as evidenced by the fact that this locus was not detected in crosses of c57bl/ <dig> mice with the genetically susceptible a/j strain but it was instead detected in crosses of a/j with balb/c mice  <cit>  and in crosses between swr/j and balb/c mice  <cit> . therefore, cxb mice strains represent a suitable model to fine map phenotypic effects associated with balb/c-derived alleles, especially at the papg <dig> locus.

herein, we carried out a genome-wide association study on lung tumor susceptibility in a population of cxb mice crossed with the swr/j strain to further characterize the papg <dig> locus. our experimental design was similar to the generation of ri intercrosses, which are f <dig> hybrids between pairs of parental ri lines  <cit> . in our study, therefore, the mice generated from crossing a mouse from a given cxb line with an swr/j mouse were isogenic and had a heterozygous genome structure. our f <dig> population maintained the same genetic resolution capability of the  <dig> cxb ri lines: no additional recombinations were introduced by crossing with the swr/j strain, since both cxb and swr/j mice are inbred and, therefore, homozygous at all genetic loci. however, introduction of the swr/j allele at any genetic locus and the expansion of each cxb line allowed us to test the effects of the balb/c-derived alleles on lung tumor size in the permissive swr/j genetic background.

since papg <dig> is the only locus known to specifically modulate lung tumor size in mice, the definition of genes in this locus may help identify new targets of therapy against lung tumor progression. the first steps toward the identification and characterization of such candidate genes are confirming the mapping in independent experiments and reducing the size of the mapping region. to this aim, we carried out a genetic association study in f <dig> mice.

RESULTS
lung tumor phenotypes in cxb ri crossed with swr/j mice
swr/j female mice and cxbn  male mice were crossed to generate a population of  <dig> f <dig> mice . in these crosses, for each locus, one allele of a cxbn mouse line was replaced with a swr/j-derived allele. thus mice belonging to each of the  <dig> swr/j x cxbn crosses were genetically identical and heterozygous at all genetic loci, as they consisted of f <dig> hybrids between inbred strains. at  <dig> weeks of age, these animals were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of urethane to induce lung tumors. the experiment was terminated at  <dig> weeks, when lung tumors were assessed for number and size.

in the population of  <dig> f <dig> mice treated with urethane, the mean lung tumor volume  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  mm <dig> in individual animals, giving a population mean of  <dig>  mm <dig> . the number of lung tumors ≥ <dig> mm in diameter  ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> per animal . overall,  <dig> of  <dig> mice  developed one or more lung tumors with diameter ≥ <dig> mm. the  <dig> different lines showed marked variability in their n2lung phenotype, pointing to the presence of genetic factors modulating this phenotype .

analysis of sex differences in lung tumorigenesis among the different cxbn crosses with the swr/j mice showed higher n2lung values  in males than in females in  <dig> crosses. therefore, the association analyses between phenotypes and genotypes were adjusted for sex.

genome-wide association analysis
a significant correlation was found between vlung and n2lung . the high value of the correlation coefficient suggested that the two measures detected the same phenotype. however, n2lung specifically indicates the number of large tumors, whereas vlung also contains information on small tumors. therefore, n2lung was judged to be the phenotype more closely related to lung tumor growth and was used in the genome-wide association analysis.

values of n2lung were square-root-transformed to approximate a normal distribution. information on  <dig> informative autosomal snps  in the cxbn lines was obtained from the wellcome trust centre for human genetics. the qfam procedure  implemented in plink  <dig>  was used to detect statistically significant associations after adjusting by sex and by performing  <dig> permutations per snp. this procedure, which takes into account family structure, calculated a -logp of  <dig>  for the best associated snp . had family structure been ignored, i.e. if only a simple linear regression of phenotype on genotype had been performed, the asymptotic p-values would have been inflated, e.g. reaching -logp= <dig>  for the same marker.

a manhattan plot of qfam results revealed peaks of association between n2lung and snps, above a threshold of empirical p-values < <dig>  , on several chromosomal regions . on chromosome  <dig>  rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb  and rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb  showed the best associations with n2lung phenotype. these data confirm our earlier mapping of the papg <dig> locus on chromosome  <dig> and narrow the size the mapping region to ~ <dig> mb. the genome-wide association analysis identified other, new loci putatively modulating n2lung: rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb ; rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb ; rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb ; rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb ; cel-15_ <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb ; and rs <dig> on chromosome  <dig> at  <dig>  mb .

linkage disequilibrium between papg <dig> locus snps and other snps associated with n2lung
some of the associations detected between n2lung and snps may be false positives because of linkage disequilibrium  between the papg <dig> chromosomal region and unlinked chromosomal regions in the cxbn lines, as has been described for other ri strains  <cit> . to exclude false-positive loci, we analyzed ld between the two snps on chromosome  <dig> associated with n2lung  and the best associated snps on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . high values of d’  were observed between the papg1-associated snp rs <dig> and rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . for the other papg1-associated snp, rs <dig>  high d’ values were found for rs <dig> , rs <dig> , rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . in contrast, rs <dig> and cel-15_ <dig>  on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, showed relatively weak ld with both top snps of the papg <dig> locus. these results suggest that the peak associations observed on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> may be false positives due to ld of the relative regions with the papg <dig> region of chromosome  <dig>  in contrast, the peak associations observed on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> appear to define new putative lung tumor size modifier loci.

fine mapping of the papg <dig> locus
on chromosome  <dig>  rs <dig> had the best association with n2lung phenotype . a plot of qfam -logp values across the reduced mapping region of the papg <dig> locus defined by the snps rs <dig> and rs <dig>  revealed that, distal to rs <dig> , a region of ~ <dig> mb did not contain informative markers; thus, the two snps flanking rs <dig> defined a region of ~ <dig>  mb. then, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb there was a cluster of  <dig> snps with slightly lower statistical associations ; this was followed by another cluster of  <dig> snps, from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb, with even lower statistical associations . finally, the region from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb contained  <dig> snps with -logp values of ~ <dig> - <dig> , just below that of rs3654162; the two snps flanking the peak snp of this region, rs <dig>  spanned a ~ <dig>  mb long region. these data confirm the existence of the previously mapped proximal region of the papg <dig> locus  in the f <dig> population and indicate that it is composed of two different peaks. however, these data do not confirm, in this population, the remainder of the locus from  <dig> to  <dig> mb.

looking in greater detail at the genetic content of the more narrowly mapped papg <dig>  the best papg1-associated snp, rs <dig> at  <dig>  mb, maps to an intergenic region between the megf <dig> gene  and the predicted gene gm <dig>  in the ~ <dig>  mb region delimited by the two markers that flank this snp, namely rs <dig> and rs <dig>  there are  <dig> genes or predicted genes. in the distal associated region delimited by snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> and spanning  <dig>  mb,  <dig> genes or predicted genes map. the best associated snp in this region, rs <dig>  is located in an intergenic region flanked by dmrta <dig>  and the predicted gene gm <dig>  about  <dig> kb proximal to rs <dig> maps cdkn2a, a gene previously proposed for candidacy of papg <dig> functions  <cit> .

phenotype-by-genotype analysis showed that f <dig> animals that inherited the balb/c-derived allele at the proximal best associated snp  had a ~5-fold higher mean value of n2lung than did animals inheriting the c57bl/6j allele . similar findings were observed at the distal best associated snp : mice inheriting the balb/c-derived allele had a ~5-fold higher mean value of n2lung than mice inheriting the c57bl/6j allele. these finding are in agreement with our previous observations showing the association of large lung tumors with the balb/c-derived allele at the papg <dig> locus  <cit> .

discussion
in the present study, 4-week-old f <dig> intercross mice were treated with urethane to induce lung neoplasia and evaluated at age  <dig> weeks for lung tumor multiplicity. using the number of large lung tumors , we carried out a genome-wide association study on  <dig> snps to identify loci that modulate lung tumor progression. two distinct but nearby peaks of association were found on chromosome  <dig>  confirming the mapping of the papg <dig> locus in a new cross and narrowing the size of the mapping region to two stretches of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb. additional peaks of association were found on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  but an analysis of ld excluded those on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> as false positives leaving two possible new loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> 

to study lung tumorigenesis, we induced neoplastic lesions by a single injection of urethane. since this chemical carcinogen has a short half-life   <cit> , tumor initiation began at essentially the same time point in all animals. the two variables of lung tumor formation initially studied, vlung and n2lung, were highly correlated. however, since n2lung referred to large tumors, we judged it to be more representative of lung tumor progression. this variable is an easy to assess quantitative measure of lung tumor size, which is a surrogate of lung tumor progression phenotype. indeed, it represents the tendency of an individual mouse to develop a low or high frequency of tumors of large size in a defined time interval. and, although the propensity of individual tumors to progress may be due to somatic alterations  <cit> , differences in mean size of lung tumors among groups of isogenic animals reflects the genetic predisposition of these animals to lung tumor progression.

the fact that two peaks of association were detected on chromosome  <dig>  separated by a valley  of weak statistical association, suggests that papg <dig> is a complex multigenic locus containing at least two and possibly more genes whose different alleles modulate lung tumor progression in mice. the distal peak of association contains, in its distal part, cdkn2a, mapping at  <dig> - <dig>  mb. this gene had previously been proposed as a candidate gene for papg <dig> since, in a/j and balb/c crosses treated with urethane and analyzed for lung tumor multiplicity, it maps in the linkage region of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this candidacy is therefore confirmed by the present study. however, the qtl curve of the earlier study showed low linkage values in the proximal part of papg <dig> where rs <dig>  the snp with the best association in our study, was mapped . these discrepant results for the proximal peak may reflect the different durations of the period after urethane treatment  or the different strains crossed with balb/c mice .

an additional study proposed cdkn2a as a candidate gene for the papg <dig> locus based on the observation that mice with a heterozygous deficiency for the a/j-derived cdkn2a allele were significantly more susceptible to lung tumor progression than mice with a heterozygous deficiency for the balb/cj-derived cdkn2a allele  <cit> . these data suggested that the a/j-derived allele of cdkn2a is a more potent tumor suppressor than the balb/cj-derived allele and pointed to cdkn2a as being responsible for papg <dig> function.

we cannot exclude that additional genes are involved in papg <dig> functions since a large number of genes, predicted genes and small nuclear rnas map in the papg <dig> locus. the proximal region of this locus, near rs <dig>  contains megf <dig> and tle <dig>  which are both known to be involved in tumorigenesis. in particular, tle <dig> is a transcriptional repressor protein whose overexpression promotes resistance to anoikis  in human breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . it was also found to be upregulated in invasive human breast cancer compared to noninvasive carcinoma and normal mammary epithelial tissue  <cit> . expression of megf <dig>  a transmembrane protein with multiple egf-like domains, was associated with local aggressiveness in human soft tissue tumors  <cit> . the distal region of the papg <dig> locus contains, besides cdkn2a, several other genes, mostly belonging to the interferon family ; it is therefore possible that the function of this locus is due to some gene involved in the antitumoral immune response  <cit> . another gene in this region is mtap, known to be a tumor suppressor gene since mice with heterozygous mtap germ-line mutations developed t-cell lymphoma and died prematurely  <cit> . additional studies could clarify the roles, if any, of these genes in lung tumor progression.

a further refinement of the map of this locus is needed to reduce the size of the chromosomal region functionally linked with modulation of lung tumor size and, consequently, the number of candidate genes. this refinement may be achieved by marker-assisted backcrossing of the balb/c-derived allele into the swr/j genetic background to generate congenic strains, as has already been done for the functional cloning of candidate genes of loci in other mouse crosses  <cit> .

additional loci associated with n2lung, not previously reported in f <dig> or f <dig> intercrosses, were detected on other chromosomes. loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were determined to be false positives due to ld with papg <dig>  whereas the loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  not in ld with papg <dig>  may be true additional loci modulating lung tumor size resulting from the introduction of the c57bl/ <dig> genome in the present cross. it should be noted, however, that a lung tumor modifier locus  had been mapped on chromosome  <dig>  in a position slightly proximal to the one herein identified, in an intercross population between a/j and c57bl/6j mice  <cit> . further research should determine if chromosome  <dig> contains another tumor-modifying locus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study shows the complex multigenic nature of papg <dig>  which appears to contain two or more genes modulating lung tumor progression in mice. a strong candidate for this locus is cdkn2a, while the identification of other candidate genes requires additional studies. moreover, the study provides evidence for putative new loci affecting lung tumor size, thereby adding additional genetic elements to the complex control of lung tumor progression. our results encourage further research to identify additional candidate papg <dig> genes to understand the mechanisms of germ-line modulation of lung tumor progression in mice. such knowledge may be of relevance to other species, including humans, in the identification of genes modulating lung tumor progression.
