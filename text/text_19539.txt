BACKGROUND
the potato  is the most important crop of the solanaceae. it is a tetraploid, non-inbred, annual plant species that is vegetatively propagated by tubers. polyploidy and inbreeding depression prevent the generation of homozygous lines. when the ploidy level is reduced from 4n to 2n, the diploid potatoes are self incompatible. potato genotypes at all ploidy levels are therefore heterozygous  <cit> . the basic chromosome number of potato is twelve and its genome size is in the order of  <dig> to  <dig> megabases, similar to the closely related tomato . detailed rflp  linkage maps have been constructed for the twelve chromosomes  <cit> , which were subsequently used to locate in the potato genome factors controlling monogenic and polygenic traits of agronomic relevance such as resistance to pests and pathogens or tuber quality  . when using the same locus specific dna-based markers in different mapping populations, the positional information of the mapped factors controlling qualitative and quantitative traits can be compared and integrated. this comparison showed that a number of the factors which control qualitative  or quantitative resistance  to different types of pathogens map to similar positions. these chromosomal regions are so-called hot-spots for pathogen resistance. one of the most conspicuous resistance hot-spots in the potato genome is located on potato chromosome v, in a chromosome segment tagged by the dna-based markers gp <dig> and gp <dig>  the  <dig> cm interval between gp <dig> and gp <dig>  <cit>  includes the r genes rx <dig> and nb both for resistance to potato virus x  <cit>  and the r <dig> gene for race-specific resistance to the oomycete phytophthora infestans causing late blight  <cit> . the same markers are also linked to qrl for p. infestans  <cit>  and qrl for the root cyst nematodes g. rostochiensis and g. pallida  <cit> . as shown by qtl mapping  <cit> , this region on potato chromosome v not only contains genes for resistance to various pathogens but also genes controlling plant vigor, plant maturity , tuber yield, tuber starch and tuber sugar content.

two r genes from the chromosome v resistance hot-spot have been functionally characterized, rx <dig> for extreme resistance to potato virus x  <cit>  and r <dig> for resistance to p. infestans  <cit> . both r genes are members of the superfamily of plant resistance genes characterized by a coiled coil , a nucleotide binding  and a leucine rich repeat  domain  <cit> , but otherwise share low sequence similarity. r <dig> has been introgressed from the allo-hexaploid – wild potato species solanum demissum into the cultivated potato germplasm pool  <cit>  and is one member of a clustered gene family in the gp21–gp <dig> interval  <cit> . the molecular basis of the qrl for late blight and root cyst nematodes in the same region is unknown. one possibility is that alleles of the r <dig> and/or the rx <dig> gene, or other members of the r <dig> gene family and/or another resistance-gene-like  family in this genome region encode the factors for the quantitative resistance phenotypes, similar to classical plant genetic studies, where resistance loci with multiple specificities to different races of a pathogen may be alleles of the same gene, or tightly linked genes  <cit> . however, the resolution of qtl mapping in this region of the potato genome, even when based on large populations related by descent  <cit>  is low. genes physically linked to the r <dig> family, but structurally and functionally unrelated to r <dig> or other rgls, cannot be excluded as candidates for the qrl of interest. high resolution mapping and map-based cloning of qtl based on recombinant inbred populations or near isogenic lines  <cit>  is not feasible in potato due to self-incompatibility. as an alternative approach, genomic sequencing and annotation can provide information on all putative genes present in the whole region, which then might be further examined for function as quantitative trait loci, first in silico by functional annotation and then experimentally by analysis of natural allelic diversity of positional candidates and complementation analysis using candidate gene allelic variants  <cit> . powerful bioinformatic tools for gene annotation  <cit>  and functional analysis of sequence related genes in model plants such as arabidopsis thaliana and rice can facilitate the selection of functional candidate genes among all the positional candidates in a genome segment harboring qtl.

parts of the genomic region corresponding to the gp21–gp <dig> interval in s. demissum were sequenced and three different haplotypes a, b and c equivalent to the three homeologous chromosome pairs of s. demissum were identified  <cit> . they demonstrated substantial structural variation among the haplotype sequences. in this paper, we report the genomic sequence analysis of two orthologous chromosome segments of the heterozygous, diploid solanum tuberosum genotype p6/ <dig> in the same gp21–gp <dig> interval. two independent bacterial artificial chromosome  contigs, corresponding to the homologous chromosomes of p6/ <dig> were constructed, sequenced and annotated, thereby extending the genomic sequence information available in this functionally important region of the potato genome. comparative sequence analysis revealed regions with severe structural distortions and deviations from gene by gene co-linearity, which are flanked by conserved regions showing microsynteny with the a. thaliana genome.

RESULTS
contig construction and bac sequencing
the potato clone p6/ <dig> used to construct the bac libraries was heterozygous for r <dig> . physical mapping in the context of cloning the r <dig> resistance gene had identified overlapping bac insertions that originated from the homologous chromosomes carrying either the r <dig> resistance allele or an r <dig> allele for susceptibility  <cit> . in order to obtain two contigs, one for each homologous chromosome in the r <dig> genomic region, the physical map was extended. subsequently, we refer to the two contigs as the r1-contig and the r1-contig.

the r1-contig was extended proximally, starting from ba27c <dig> by clone bc93c <dig> . this bac was identified by pcr screening of the bc library using specific primers that were developed based on the sequence of the proximal bac end of ba27c <dig>  additional  <dig> bacs from this region, all containing one or more members of the r <dig> gene family, were identified by colony filter hybridization using as probe a  <dig>  kb dna fragment amplified with r <dig> gene specific oligonucleotides 76-2sf <dig> and 76-2sr  <cit> . among the clones containing r <dig> homologous genes were ba132h <dig> and ba213c <dig>  clone ba132h <dig> overlaps with bc93c <dig>  and ba213c <dig> overlaps with ba87d <dig> . the gap between ba132h <dig> and ba87d <dig> was bridged by clone bc136j <dig> . from the seven bac clones that constitute a minimal tiling path including the r <dig> locus, six bac inserts were fully and one  was partially sequenced . the r1-contig consisted of clones ba122p <dig> and ba76o <dig> and was extended proximally by clone ba111o <dig> . all three clones were fully sequenced .

genomic sequence analysis
the  <dig>   <dig> kbp genomic sequence obtained from seven r1- and three r1-bac insertions was assembled into two distinguished, unambiguous stretches of dna sequence corresponding to the r1- and r1-contig of  <dig>  base pairs  and  <dig>  base pairs , respectively, using megamerger. overall gc content in the r1- and r1-contig is  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

the two contig sequences share highly similar and collinear regions, but these are interrupted by more variable regions . in addition, an inversion and an inverted repeat were identified. tandem repeats corresponding to six copies of r <dig> homologous genes in the r <dig> contig and three copies in the r <dig> contig were identified. these repeats are embedded in a region of non-alignable sequence.

for easier reference, we label regions along the r <dig> contig from a to f  based on features revealed by comparison of the r <dig> with the r <dig> contig using mummer . for region a, no sequence was obtained from r <dig>  region b is highly similar to the start of contig r <dig>  in region c, co-linearity and alignment are disturbed, and similarity is primarily detected in three tandem repeats. no similarity to r <dig> is detected in region d. region e  again aligns well with r <dig>  but in reverse orientation, indicating a genomic inversion. region f, resembling region c, is not aligned well but contains two tandem repeats that are highly similar to the tandem repeats in region c, but in inverse orientation. region b contains a palindromic structure discussed in more detail below.

comparison to the a, b and c haplotypes of the orthologous genome region in solanum demissum  <cit>  revealed similar features . the r <dig> contig is most closely related to the a sequence, with co-linearity and high sequence identity . however, we orient bac pgec472p <dig>  of a in reverse orientation compared to  <cit> , thereby introducing the inversion of a and r <dig> relative to r <dig>  b and c . the r <dig> contig is more similar to the sequences of b and c haplotypes of s. demissum.

regions a and b show co-linearity with the s. demissum genomic regions ii and iii as defined by another study  <cit> , whereas regions c through f correspond to s. demissum genomic regions iv and v.

gene content
we predict that the r <dig> contig contains  <dig> genes, seven of which are transposons and three are pseudogenes. thirteen protein coding genes on the r <dig> contig can be identified as orthologs of collinear genes on r <dig>  however, on r <dig> there are two additional protein coding genes. six transposon genes are specific to r <dig>  and for one pseudogene, we could not identify a partner on r <dig>  on average, one orf is annotated in every  <dig> kbp of genomic sequence. the average gc content of exons is 39%.

a putative function was assigned based on similarity to proteins of known function with an e-value smaller than 10- <dig> . thirteen genes are related to retrotransposons. two multigene families, f-box proteins and nbs  type resistance genes, are represented by several members. six proteins on contig r <dig> and three on r <dig> are members of the r <dig> gene family. at least eleven f-box proteins are found on r <dig>  but none of these are found in r1-contig.

orfs are numbered according to figure  <dig> 

manual functional annotation was based on blast hits and/or domain prediction results, see methods. more details are shown in additional file  <dig> 

where sequence from both contigs was available, most proteins and some transposon-related genes are conserved between the r <dig> and r <dig> contig . notable exceptions are  <dig> retroelements, six of which were found only in the r <dig> contig  and  <dig> in the r <dig> contig . the palindromic structure in region b is formed by an inverted repeat of two highly similar rna-directed rna polymerases , separated by a hypothetical protein . the r <dig> specific retrotransposon 14/ <dig> is inserted between the inverted repeats. region e contains five genes that are conserved between r <dig> and r <dig> but in reverse order and orientation, indicating a genomic inversion. the proximal two genes are members of the r <dig> family, orf  <dig> being the functional r <dig> resistance gene  and the following orf  <dig> is a tandem duplicate. orfs  <dig> and  <dig> are conserved in sequence, but having inverse order and orientation, with resistance gene homologues  <dig> and  <dig> on contig r <dig>  suggesting that the inversion includes these two genes. however, proteins  <dig> and  <dig> are more similar to each other than to  <dig> or  <dig>  indicating that they may have arisen through tandem duplication after the inversion event. another resistance gene homologue  follows on contig r <dig>  but is less similar to the other r1-related genes. also two genes  could not be related to any locus on contig r <dig>  this suggests that the proximal breakpoint of the genomic inversion in contig r <dig> is after gene  <dig> or  <dig> 

to map the distal breakpoint of the inversion event on contig r <dig>  we used sequence from s. demissum bac pgec093p <dig> , as the sequence of contig r <dig> did not extend sufficiently far in proximal direction. the pgec093p <dig> sequence contains orthologs of proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the same order and orientation as found on contig r <dig>  therefore inverted with respect to r <dig>  as in r <dig>  the r <dig> specific transposon orf  <dig> is not found in pgec093p <dig> . proximal to protein  <dig> followed probable orthologs of proteins  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in reverse order and orientation compared to contig r <dig>  indicating that these three genes are part of the inversion. the remaining pgec093p <dig> sequence proximal to orf  <dig> contains only transposon fragments and hypothetical proteins, which are unrelated to genes distal to orf  <dig>  in the r1-contig. this maps the distal inversion breakpoint in contig r <dig> between genes  <dig> and  <dig>  as consequence of the inversion, genes  <dig> to  <dig> in the r <dig> contig are probably part of a region that is, at least at this genomic location, r <dig> specific. this region includes two r <dig> homologous genes  in tandem orientation to orf  <dig>  two transposon-related genes and a series of eight f-box genes. for the flanking regions of contig r <dig>  we found almost perfect gene-by-gene co-linearity to r <dig> or pgec093p <dig>  we could not assign three genes in contig r <dig> to any collinear region, two of which are transposons and one resembles a fragmented resistance gene.

microsynteny with the a. thaliana genome
five microsyntenic blocks were identified in a. thaliana based on the arbitrary criterion of finding at least three pairs of homologous protein sequences within a comparable physical distance . when the potato annotated proteins were compared to the a. thaliana annotated proteins, only orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not have any hit. each member of the 'resistance-gene-like' and 'f-box containing' gene families had more than  <dig> hits. due to the high copy number, these two multigene families and the retrotransposons were not considered when searching for groups of in both species physically closely linked homologue pairs . the  <dig> remaining potato orfs used for microsynteny analysis had on average  <dig>  hits in the a. thaliana genome. the five syntenic blocks involve three sections within the potato contigs,  the distal orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>   orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the middle part and  orfs  <dig> to  <dig> in the proximal region. the syntenic blocks i, ii and iii comprise between  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp potato sequence and are syntenic with three different, smaller a. thaliana genome fragments from  <dig> kbp to  <dig> kbp on chromosome  <dig>  the four consecutive a. thaliana genes in block i have the same relative orientation of transcription and the same order as the homologous potato orf  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the r1-contig . the largest syntenic region identified in both species is block iii, including  <dig> potato orfs, which spans nearly the whole r1-contig . the corresponding a. thaliana genome fragment is  <dig> kbp in size and contains  <dig> annotated genes, seven in the same order and homologous to orfs in the r1-contig, one f-box gene  and four other, consecutive genes that are not syntenic . block ii with four syntenic orfs is second in size . the related a. thaliana genome fragment of only  <dig> kbp contain five annotated genes, four homologous to the potato orfs and the fifth one different . potato orfs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are located within  <dig> kbp in the r1-contig. the a. thaliana genome fragment iv on chromosome  <dig> is larger , whereas fragment v on chromosome  <dig> is nearly identical in size . the three orfs in block v are not only located in genomic fragments of similar size in both species but also in the same order and in the same orientation of transcription. it is unlikely that the five syntenic blocks occur by chance only. we estimate the probability of finding three hits within  <dig> kb in a. thaliana to be less than 10- <dig> using an approximation described in  <cit> : hn × n- <dig>  where h is the average number of hits of the potato genes in a. thaliana , n the number of genes conserved in the syntenic block ,  <dig>  mbp the size of the syntenic block in a. thaliana and  <dig> mbp the size of the a. thaliana genome . none of the syntenic a. thaliana genome fragments include a putative or functional gene for pathogen resistance and only one includes an f-box containing gene. the a. thaliana gene rpp <dig> conferring resistance to peronospora parasitica and having the highest sequence similarity to the r <dig> gene family  is located on chromosome  <dig> outside any putatively syntenic region.

discussion
genome structure
we found extensive co-linearity of protein-coding genes, interrupted by unilateral insertions of retrotransposons and a region of highly diverged dna sequence in the vicinity of clusters of tandem duplicated genes. this corresponds to findings in the orthologous genomic region of hexaploid s. demissum  <cit> . we show that a  <dig> kb region containing ten protein-coding genes is inverted in both the r <dig> contig and presumably also the a haplotype of s. demissum. while sequence similarity at the nucleotide level was not sufficient to precisely map the inversion breakpoints in the intergenic regions, order and orientation of homologous gene pairs were consistent without exception and allowed to estimate the position of the inversion breakpoints. this inversion is not evident in the available sequence of the s. demissum a haplotype, as bac pgec472p <dig>  mainly contains genes from the inversion and only few beyond the inversion breakpoint. the gap in the sequence of haplotype a presumably led to bac pgec472p <dig> being oriented to achieve co-linearity with b and c haplotypes. kuang et al.  <cit>  do not present any data, e.g. mapping of bac ends or overlaps with neighboring bac clones, to verify the orientation. thus, we take the high sequence similarity, uninterrupted across the presumed inversion break point, between the r <dig> contig and pgec472p <dig> to indicate that the inversion also exists in the a haplotype .

currently, there are only few examples where comparative structural analysis of orthologous genome segments was performed in crop plants over several hundred kb. in all cases reported, micro-structural diversity was found, e.g. in zea mays  <cit> . in maize the major contribution to diversity stems from ltr retrotransposons. in our analysis transposon related genes are less conserved, also suggesting recent insertions and deletions. in tomato , a segment on chromosome  <dig> containing the mi- <dig> gene for resistance to root knot nematodes, which has been introgressed from s. peruvianum, was shown to be inverted in resistant when compared to susceptible tomato genotypes  <cit> . the situation at the potato r <dig> locus described here remarkably resembles this finding. the r1-contig is part of a genome fragment of unknown size introgressed from s. demissum into s. tuberosum, whereas the r1-contig originated either from s. tuberosum or s. spegazzinii, another closely related tuber bearing solanum species. p <dig>  the parental donor of the r <dig> allele, was an inter-specific hybrid between s. tuberosum and s. spegazzinii  <cit> . the structural differences between the homologous chromosomes could interfere with chromosome pairing and crossing-over during meiosis, explaining the low frequency of recombination observed in this region  <cit> . similarly, in regions on tomato chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  where the resistance loci mi and tm2a, respectively, have been introgressed from the wild species s. peruvianum, a high degree of recombination suppression was observed  <cit> .

in the r <dig> contig, the inversion seems to have separated the r <dig> resistance gene from a tandem array of r <dig> homologs . we attempted to date the inversion relative to the duplications of tandem resistance genes by phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences, but the results were inconclusive . proteins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clustered together. proteins  <dig> and 22/ <dig> also clustered together, and even though gene  <dig> on the r <dig> contig is truncated at the n-terminus relative to 22/ <dig> and the other r <dig> homologous proteins, we assume these to be an orthologous pair. for the other r <dig> homologues, allelic relationships are not clear, and they may have arisen through duplication after the divergence of r <dig> and r <dig> 

kuang et al  <cit>  analyzed the same genomic region on potato chromosome v between three homeologous chromosomes of the allo-hexaploid potato species s. demissum. alignment of the sequenced s. demissum bacs with the r1- and r1-contig identified haplotypes a and b/c as most similar but not identical to the r1- and r1-contig, respectively. similarity of individual homologous protein pairs between b and r <dig> or c and r <dig> ranges between  <dig> and 99% identity on the amino acid level, with most, but not all proteins slightly more similar between c and r <dig> than between b and r <dig>  on the other hand, the b haplotype is structurally more similar to r <dig>  as c shows no tandem repeated r <dig> homologous genes but only one single copy.

remarkable is the discovery of highly conserved and seemingly rapidly evolving genome regions in close vicinity. the distinguishing feature, aside from the observed breakdown of nucleotide sequence similarity in non-coding regions and the lack of gene-by-gene co-linearity, is the presence of tandem repeated genes, namely r <dig> homologs and f-box containing genes. such tandem arrays have been found in other hypervariable genome regions  <cit>  and may have lead to a greatly enhanced rate of evolution due to relaxed selection pressure on duplicated genes. neighboring unique sequences are, in contrast, highly conserved. in the variable region, the r <dig> and r <dig> contigs and the three s. demissum haplotypes show striking structural variation, ranging from lack of the variable region in s. demissum haplotype c to the expanded set of f-box proteins found in the r <dig> contig. the latter are missing from r <dig> and b. instead, in the b haplotype the r <dig> homologous gene tandem array is more expanded .

encoded proteins
we found a gene density of one gene every  <dig> kb, which is similar to previous findings in s. demissum  and tomato , but lower than a. thaliana  and rice , and higher than in barley, where only three genes were found in a stretch of  <dig> kbp genomic dna  <cit> . the overall gc content was 37% and  <dig> % within the putative gene coding regions. these values are comparable to tomato  and a. thaliana  but lower than in rice  and maize . in the corresponding region of s. demissum haplotype b, four putative full length r <dig> homologous genes and six partial homologues were identified. in s. demissum haplotype c, one complete r <dig> homologue was found  <cit> , whereas three complete members of the r <dig> gene family  were annotated in contig r <dig>  allelic relationships between the r <dig> homologues could not be deduced with certainty, but proteins  <dig> and 22/ <dig> might be allelic based on collinear positions in the r1- and r1-contig, whereas proteins  <dig> and  <dig> might be allelic to  <dig> and  <dig> respectively as they are collinear under the assumption that they are part of the proposed genomic inversion.

most of the molecular characterized plant r genes are members of tightly linked gene families  <cit> . the r <dig> gene family is no exception in this respect. allelic variants of the nine identified members of the r <dig> family or additional paralogous members that are not present in genotype p6/ <dig> are non-exclusive candidates for the quantitative resistance traits in the resistance hot spot on potato chromosome v. at this point, we only know that some of the r <dig> homologues likely have functions other than the r <dig> resistance gene. this is based on the observation that the r <dig> homologue encoded by orf  <dig> was not capable to complement the r <dig> race specific resistance phenotype .

genes sequence-related to retrotransposons, ribosomal genes, rna dependent rna polymerase and pseudogenes are ranked low for being functional candidates for the quantitative traits in this region of the potato genome. the remaining  <dig> putative genes, including hypothetical genes and genes with unknown function, are all positional candidates for the qtl. of particular interest as new candidates for quantitative resistance loci, besides the members of the r <dig> gene family, are the members of the f-box domain family. f-box proteins are involved in various signaling pathways in a. thaliana, and recently, f-box proteins are suggested to function as receptors for various plant hormones  <cit> . furthermore, an f-box domain was identified in the sgt <dig> protein that was shown to play a role as co-chaperon in the stabilization of r-proteins  <cit> . with the annotation of the sequenced region, the list of positional candidate genes for the qtl is certainly not complete, as the sequence covers only part of the gp21–gp <dig> interval. to ultimately validate the role of any candidate gene for a qtl, complementation analysis with allelic variants is required. unless high-throughput methods for complementation analysis become available, strategies to reduce the number of candidate genes to be considered for complementation analysis are necessary. for example, we perform functional testing by expression studies and by down-regulation of candidate gene expression by antisense or rnai approaches  <cit> . the model plant a. thaliana may also be used to study the function of genes that are most closely sequence-related to potato positional candidate genes. unfortunately, this approach may not be applicable to the f-box family, as this is also a highly expanded gene family in a. thaliana with diverse cellular roles.

synteny with a. thaliana
we identified at least five microsyntenic relationships between the r <dig> contig and a. thaliana. these cover varying stretches of the genome, ranging from just four consecutive genes within  <dig> kb of a. thaliana and  <dig> kb of potato to basically the entire r <dig> contig, covering  <dig> kb. frequent insertion-deletion events can be detected. similar patterns of interrupted co-linearity on the dna sequence level were found among cereals  <cit>  and between a. thaliana and rice  <cit> . in the highly collinear tomato genome  <cit> , genomic sequences of  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp on chromosome  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> , respectively, have been compared to the a. thaliana genomic sequence. these studies revealed syntenic blocks of comparable redundancy and size with respect to the a. thaliana syntenic regions. in contrast to these previous studies, the contiguous potato sequence compared was  <dig> to 8-times longer. this revealed that the syntenic potato genes in the r1-contig were organized in three clusters  that were separated by two non-syntenic regions . in the r1-contig, a non-syntenic region  separated two syntenic regions .

the most notable of the syntenic relationships spans almost the complete r <dig> contig  and  <dig> kbp of a. thaliana chromosome  <dig>  seven genes are conserved in sequence, order and orientation, except for two from region e that show reverse order and orientation compared to a. thaliana. this could indicate that the genomic inversion occurred in the r <dig> lineage after the divergence of a. thaliana and potato, with r <dig> and s. demissum b and c haplotypes showing the ancestral orientation. in the r <dig> contig, a large number  of genes do not show synteny, whereas in the a. thaliana region this only applies to five genes. the discrepancy is less pronounced if the  <dig> tandemly duplicated genes in potato are ignored.

the non-syntenic regions correspond to the highly divergent regions between r <dig> and r <dig> and included all but one  transposon sequences, all f-box-containing genes and six of the ten resistance-gene-homologues. the annotation of the a. thaliana syntenic regions identified, besides the sequence related orfs, some transposon sequences but only one f-box-containing gene and no resistance gene homolog. moreover, the non-syntenic regions in the r1- and r1-contigs coincided with regions ii and iv in s. demissum, which showed the highest divergence between the homeologous chromosome segments a, b and c  <cit> . this suggests that the genome of potato and related species in the sequenced region consists of a patchwork of faster and more slowly evolving segments.

the sequenced potato genomic segment covers a genetic distance of only  <dig>  centimorgan. at a hundred times larger scale, when genome-wide genetic maps of potato, sunflower, sugar beet and prunus were compared to the a. thaliana physical map , syntenic blocks from  <dig> to  <dig> centimorgans were identified. a common fraction of the genomes of these distantly related plant species appear to have been conserved throughout the evolution of the dicots, when compared to the rest of the genome  <cit> . the gp21–gp <dig> interval was not part of a macrosyntenic block between potato and a. thaliana  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
two contiguous sequences of  <dig>  and  <dig>  base pairs were assembled and annotated for a region on potato chromosome v, which contains genes controling several agronomic traits. comparative sequence analysis revealed highly conserved collinear regions that flank regions showing high variability and tandem duplicated genes. the co-linearity between the homologous chromosomes was disrupted by non-allelic insertions of retrotransposon elements, stretches of diverged intergenic sequences, differences in gene content and gene order. the latter was mainly caused by inversion of a  <dig> kbp genomic fragment.

annotation of the genomic sequence identified  <dig> putative open reading frames  in one contig and  <dig> in the other, with an average of one orf every  <dig> kbp. the majority of the orfs were members of multiple gene families. ten orfs were classified as resistance-gene-like,  <dig> as f-box-containing genes,  <dig> as transposable elements and three as transcription factors. comparing potato to arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins revealed five micro-syntenic blocks of three to seven orfs with a. thaliana chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  suggesting fragmented structural conservation between these distantly related plant species.
