BACKGROUND
the immune system is versatile in its ability to respond specifically to a wide variety of infectious agents. specific cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell responses combined with robust antibody responses clear invading viruses. while the host efficiently clears most viruses, some have evolved strategies to evade the immune system and establish persistent infections. viral persistence has been linked to a variety of factors, including cell tropism, quantity and duration of antigen persistence and several molecular viral immune evasion strategies  <cit> . the end result is the incapacitation of the immune response and the development of t cell anergy or tolerance  <cit> .

cytokines control many aspects of the immune response, and they affect the balance between the development of immunity and tolerance  <cit> . a robust th <dig> response is necessary for the resolution of infection and development of immunity for the majority of viral infections. interleukin  <dig> , a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to dampen th <dig> responses  <cit> . several groups have shown increased il- <dig> levels during a variety of persistent bacterial and parasitic infections, including candida albicans, trypanosoma cruzi, and leishmania major  <cit> . additionally, viral il- <dig> homologues have been identified in the human viruses epstein-barr virus  and cytomegalovirus  that have the ability to persistently infect their hosts, furthering speculation that il- <dig> plays a role in sabotaging the adaptive immune response  <cit> . despite the mounting evidence in other systems, a role for host-produced il- <dig> during chronic viral infections has not been carefully studied until recently  <cit> .

lcmvarm, a natural mouse pathogen, is a prototypic virus infection model for studying effector and memory t cell formation. infected mice clear lcmvarm within  <dig> days, and large numbers of memory cd8+ t cells that confer life-long protective immunity persist in the host. in contrast, infection with lcmvclone <dig>  a two amino acid mutant of lcmvarm, leads to persistent viral infection and t cell anergy: anergic cd <dig> t cells neither kill virus-infected targets nor produce ifn-γ upon peptide stimulation  <cit> . the current study was undertaken to ascertain if il- <dig> plays a role in establishing viral persistence by inducing t cell anergy in lcmvclone13-infected mice. here we show increased levels of serum il- <dig> in mice infected with lcmvclone <dig>  but not lcmvarm. blocking il- <dig> with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody led to partial restoration of t cell function and lowered viral titers if the antibody was administered during t cell priming. the critical window for il- <dig> in establishing anergy is early during the immune response, as blockade of il- <dig> after viral persistence is established had no effect. however, the necessity of il- <dig> in establishing t cell anergy is not complete in that lcmvclone <dig> established a persistent infection in il- <dig> deficient mice, despite a robust early cd <dig> t cell response. this report clearly links persistent lcmv infection of mice, and the ensuing t cell anergy, to host-produced il- <dig> 

RESULTS
increased il- <dig> expression following infection with lcmvclone <dig> but not lcmvarm
increased levels of inhibitory cytokines such as interleukin  <dig>  have been demonstrated during persistent viral infections in humans  <cit> . infection of mice with lcmvclone <dig> induces anergy in cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells, whereas infection with lcmvarm leads to robust immunity  <cit> . we were interested to see if persistent lcmv infection led to increased levels of serum il- <dig>  we infected cohorts of mice with either lcmvarm or lcmvclone <dig>  collected their sera at various time points post-infection  and measured the il- <dig> levels by elisa . other than an early spike of il- <dig> detectable on day  <dig> post-infection, lcmvarm-infected mice had low levels of il- <dig> in their serum. il- <dig> levels in lcmvarm-infected mice increased slightly above naïve mice as immune memory developed beyond day  <dig>  in contrast, lcmvclone13-infected mice accumulated il- <dig> in their serum. beyond day  <dig> post-infection, lcmvclone13-infected mice had significantly higher levels of serum il- <dig> compared to acutely infected mice, and the levels increased with time. the steady increase in serum il- <dig> was concomitant with the functional inactivation, i.e. loss of cytolytic activity and ifn-γ production, in cd <dig> t cells . these data correlate the t cell anergy observed in persistently lcmv infected mice with an increase in serum il- <dig> 

cd <dig> t cells are critical for controlling chronic lcmv infection  <cit> . in order for il- <dig> to directly effect cd <dig> t cells, they must express the il- <dig> receptor. we confirmed il-10r expression on cd <dig> t cells during the course of acute and chronic infections. in our hands, il-10r is universally high at day  <dig> post-infection for both acute  and chronic  infections. by day  <dig>  il-10r expression has decreased on a subset of memory cd <dig> t cells in acutely infected mice. persistently infected mice, however, lose il-10r expression on the majority of cd <dig> t cells, consistent with the deletion of the majority of anti-viral cd <dig> t cells. we next assessed il-10r expression directly on lcmv-specific cd <dig> t cells. we looked at splenic gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells eight days post-infection, a time during which chronically infected mice contain virus-specific t cells with slightly impaired effector functions. gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells in both acutely and chronically infected mice had higher il-10r expression when compared to naïve cd <dig> t cells. these data are consistent with the model that il- <dig> directly affects cd <dig> t cells.

il- <dig> blockade enhances ifn-γ production in persistently infected mice  <dig> days post-infection
we next wanted to determine if neutralizing il- <dig> would have an effect on the developing t cell response during a chronic viral infection. we injected lcmvclone13-infected mice with anti-il- <dig> antibodies or normal rat igg on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> after infection. eight days following infection, cd8+ and cd4+ t cell responses were measured by peptide-induced ifn-γ production and cytolytic killing of peptide-pulsed target cells. lcmvclone13-infected animals exhibited depressed cd <dig> t cell responses: the frequency of cells responding to the immunodominant epitopes np <dig> and gp <dig> was reduced by 60–80% when compared to lcmvarm-infected mice . in contrast, mice that received il- <dig> blockade exhibited enhanced t cell responses. the frequencies of np <dig> and gp <dig> tetramer+ cd <dig> t cells were comparable to those observed in lcmvarm-infected mice . the amount of ifn-γ production per cell, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity  was higher in anti-il- <dig> treated mice than in lcmvclone13-infected, rat igg treated controls for both lcmv peptides, gp <dig>  and np <dig> .

lcmvclone13-infected mice receiving anti-il- <dig> therapy exhibited a level of ifn-γ production that was indistinguishable from lcmvarm-infected mice . mice receiving anti-il- <dig> therapy had larger spleens and significantly more  virus-specific cd8+ t lymphocytes, relative to untreated lcmvclone13-infected control mice .

cd <dig> t cells are essential for maintaining antiviral cd <dig> t cells  <cit> . therefore, we monitored the effect of anti-il- <dig> treatment on rescuing virus-specific cd <dig> t cell function by testing their ability to produce ifn-γ upon stimulation with the lcmv mhc class ii peptides gp <dig> and np <dig>  anti-il-10-treated mice exhibited higher levels of ifn-γ production by cd4+ t cells at  <dig> days p.i. . the absolute numbers of lcmv-specific cd <dig> t cells were also higher in the anti-il- <dig> treated lcmvclone13-infected group as compared to lcmvclone13-infected mice that did not receive anti-il- <dig> treatment . thus, neutralizing il- <dig> during the time that t cell priming occurs drastically enhanced peak antigen-specific cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell responses, both in absolute numbers and in function as measured by ifn-γ production.

il- <dig> blockade restores ctl activity and lowers viral load
cytolytic killing is a hallmark of activated antigen-specific cd <dig> t cells, and it is one of the first properties to be lost in persistently infected mice  <cit> . we wanted to know if il- <dig> blockade restored the cytolytic activity of cd <dig> t cells. we measured the cytolytic activity of cd <dig> t cells by 51cr release assay using target cells pulsed with the immunodominant lcmv peptides np <dig> and gp <dig> . killing of target cells was dramatically impaired in lcmvclone13-infected mice at  <dig> days p.i., but neutralizing il- <dig> in vivo restored cytotoxic activity nearly to levels observed in lcmvarm-infected mice . we then tested the mice to determine whether enhanced t cell responses induced by neutralizing il- <dig> led to a reduction in viral load. despite the improved ctl and cytokine responses in mice receiving il- <dig> blockade , they still had infectious virus . however, the level of viremia was significantly reduced  in mice receiving il- <dig> blockade . the lowered viral titers observed at day  <dig> p.i. could be due to enhanced cytolytic t cell activity or due to an enhanced antibody response to lcmv in anti-il- <dig> treated mice, or a collaboration of the two effects. to distinguish between these two possibilities we compared the anti-lcmv antibody responses at day  <dig> post-infection in groups of lcmvclone13-infected mice with or without anti-il- <dig> treatment. anti-il- <dig> blockade did not result in enhanced virus-specific humoral responses . lcmv-specific igg levels in the il-10-blocked, persistently infected mice were not significantly different than untreated controls at day  <dig> post infection . the data suggest that enhanced cytotoxic cd <dig> t cell responses and not humoral responses are responsible for the lowered viral titers observed in the anti-il- <dig> treated mice early in the response. these data further support the concept that host-produced il- <dig> directly impacts lcmv-specific cd <dig> t cells early during the immune response.

despite the initial enhanced response, mice receiving a short course of il- <dig> blockade contain a mixture of functional and anergized cd <dig> t cells, and exhibit a low-level persistent viremia
in lcmvclone13-infected mice receiving il- <dig> blockade, ifn-γ production and cytolytic killing by cd <dig> t cells were intact, and cd <dig> t cell responses were also enhanced at day  <dig> p.i. . it was essential to determine if this potent antiviral immune response could develop into immune memory and resolve the viral infection. we analyzed cd <dig> t cells from immune lcmvclone13-infected mice  with and without il- <dig> blockade for lcmv-specific mhc/tetramer binding  and ifn-γ production . in untreated lcmvclone13-infected mice, we observed large numbers of gp <dig> tetramer+ cd <dig> t cells that failed to produce ifn-γ, a characteristic phenotype of anergized virus-specific t cells  <cit> . cd <dig> t cells specific for the np <dig> epitope were mostly deleted and the rare np <dig> tetramer binding cells that were present failed to produce ifn-γ upon peptide stimulation. in contrast, mice receiving il- <dig> blockade had a small fraction of cd <dig> t cells that produced ifn-γ when stimulated with gp <dig> peptide , indicating that, at least on some level, functional cd <dig> t cells were present in persistently infected mice that received il- <dig> blockade. persistently infected, anti-il- <dig> treated mice deleted np396-specific cd <dig> t cells, similar to lcmvclone13-infected, rat igg-treated control mice. taken together, the tetramer and ifn-γ data for two immunodominant epitopes suggest that the generation of virus-specific memory cells was impaired although some gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells that retain ifn-γ production persisted in mice that received il- <dig> blockade . we also monitored cd <dig> t cell responsiveness at  <dig> days p.i. a small population of gp61/np309-specific cd4+ t cells remained in il- <dig> blocked mice, although the mfi of ifn-γ production was low .

anti-il- <dig> treated, lcmvclone13-infected mice remained persistently infected at  <dig> days p.i. . however, viremia was approximately  <dig>  logs lower in lcmvclone13-infected mice that received anti-il- <dig> therapy .

il- <dig> blockade in mice with established persistent infections did not result in enhanced t cell responsiveness or lowered viral titers
blocking il- <dig> early in the infection during t cell priming  led to enhanced lcmv-specific t cell responses and lower viral titers. we wanted to know if blocking il- <dig> was a useful strategy in lowering viral titers in mice with established persistent infections. we chose mice that were persistently infected with lcmvclone <dig>  and injected them with normal rat igg or anti-il- <dig> antibodies on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> post-infection. two weeks following anti-il- <dig> treatment we assayed these mice for cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell function and measured serum viral titers. il- <dig> blockade after establishment of viral persistence had no effect on lcmv-induced t cell tolerance. t cell anergy could not reversed , and there was no change in viremia . t cells from mice treated with anti-il- <dig> late in the infection were non-functional and indistinguishable from untreated lcmvclone13-infected mice . these data suggest that there is an early critical window during which il- <dig> works to induce anergy in t cells.

mice receiving early anti-il- <dig> therapy exhibit ctl activity following in vitro re-stimulation
next, we wanted to know if the anergy observed in anti-il- <dig> treated, lcmvclone13-infected mice was complete and irreversible, or if the effector/memory t cells that remained could expand and function. splenocytes from lcmvclone13-infected mice  were stimulated in vitro with gp <dig> peptide, in the presence of il- <dig>  for  <dig> days and their ability to kill target cells was determined by 51cr release assay . re-stimulation in vitro restored cytolytic activity of lcmvclone13-infected anti-il- <dig> treated mice; their ctl activity was comparable to lcmvarm-immune mice. in contrast, gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells from lcmvclone13-infected, untreated mice were refractory to peptide re-stimulation and failed to kill target cells. these data clearly demonstrate that il- <dig> blockade early in the viral infection led to incomplete tolerization of virus-specific cd <dig> t cells despite the fact that these mice had low-level viremia.

mice receiving anti il- <dig> therapy have an enhanced antibody response against lcmv  <dig> days post-infection
we assessed the antiviral antibody titers  <dig> days p.i. in lcmvclone13-infected mice with and without anti il- <dig> treatment . interestingly, mice receiving il- <dig> blockade had significantly greater levels of lcmv-specific antibodies than mice that did not receive anti-il- <dig> therapy . the level of antiviral igg in lcmvarm immune mice was much greater than the lcmvclone13-infected mice that received anti-il- <dig> blockade . these data, combined with the low antiviral antibody levels seen  <dig> days p.i., show that the lcmv-specific antibody response matured with time in the il- <dig> blocked mice.

il- <dig> knockout mice recapitulate the phenotype observed in anti-il- <dig> antibody treated mice: early t cell enhancement followed by induction of anergy
the data presented so far clearly show that il- <dig> blockade led to enhanced early t cell responses but not the eradication of virus. one possibility is that the t cell anergy observed at  <dig> days p.i. could be due to the inefficiency of the antibody treatment. continued blockade of il- <dig> throughout the course of persistent lcmvclone <dig> infection may result in complete viral clearance and the development of t cell immunity. to decisively determine the causal role of il- <dig> in generating t cell anergy during persistent viral infections, and to avoid the vagaries of multiple injections of heterospecific neutralizing antibodies, we attempted to persistently infect il- <dig> deficient mice. we first tested the ability of il-10-/- mice to clear acute lcmvarm infections. cohorts of il-10-/- mice were infected with  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of lcmvarm and their ability to mount t cell responses and clear virus was assayed at  <dig> days post infection. il-10-/- mice mounted robust cd <dig> t cell responses  and cleared lcmvarm  as efficiently as wild type mice. we then infected il-10-/- mice with lcmvclone <dig> and examined their t cell responses and ability to clear virus at days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. il-10-/- mice exhibited exaggerated t cell responses at  <dig> days p.i., while wild type mice exhibited virus-induced immune suppression. interestingly, heterozygous il-10+/- littermate controls exhibited t cell responses intermediate between those of control il-10+/+ and il-10-/- mice . however with time, il-10-/- mice, as well as il- <dig> heterozygotes, lost their virus-specific cd8+ t cells and became persistently infected by day  <dig> p.i. . we also tracked the ifn-γ responses to three other lcmv epitopes, including subdominant epitopes, and the patterns were identical ; responses to all epitopes tested were absent  <dig> days p.i. in il-10-/- mice. these data confirm and extend the observations made using anti-il- <dig> antibody treatment and clearly demonstrate that il- <dig> plays a direct and early role in generating t cell tolerance; however, additional mechanisms are operating to generate and/or maintain virus-induced anergy.

discussion
early anti-il- <dig> therapy resulted in an impressive enhancement in the cellular immune response to lcmvclone <dig> at  <dig> days p.i. and the humoral immune response  <dig> days p.i il-10-blocked mice had significantly higher ifn-γ production in cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cells, both in frequency and magnitude. cytolytic activity was also enhanced in the anti-il- <dig> treated mice. thus, il- <dig> blockade clearly bolstered the early immune response to lcmv such that the immune response in lcmvclone13-infected mice receiving anti-il- <dig> was indistinguishable from non-persisting lcmvarm acute infections at  <dig> days p.i. however, neutralizing il- <dig> did not completely block virus-induced cd <dig> t cell inactivation. thirty days p.i., lcmvclone13-infected mice receiving anti-il- <dig> contained gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells, the majority of which failed to produce ifn-γ, or were 'exhausted', although, some did retain the ability to produce ifn-γ upon peptide re-stimulation. interestingly, the functional deficit observed in cd <dig> t cells in anti-il- <dig> treated mice was not complete; cytolytic killing could be rescued by peptide re-stimulation in vitro in the presence of il- <dig>  while early anti-il- <dig> treatment did not prevent viral persistence, these mice exhibited significantly lower viremia compared to rat igg-treated control mice.

although il- <dig> blocked mice became chronically infected, we were able to rescue cytolytic killing following in vitro stimulation in the presence of il- <dig> . however, in our in vitro studies it was impossible to determine if we rescued cytolytic killing in all or only a fraction of gp33-specific cd <dig> t cells. indirect evidence, presented in fig. 3a &3b, shows that whereas nearly all virus-specific memory cells in acutely infected mice produce ifn-γ when stimulated, only a fraction of virus-specific cd <dig> t cells in chronically-infected il-10-blocked mice were able to make ifn-γ. although ifn-γ production and il- <dig> receptivity are not clearly or directly linked, these data suggest that we were able to rescue cytolytic killing in only a fraction of virus-specific cd <dig> t cells in the il- <dig> blocked mice. indeed, others have shown that the majority of memory cells proliferate in response to il- <dig>  <cit> . that same group showed that anergized cells did expand in response to il- <dig> in the context of persisting antigen, although it was unclear what proportion of virus-specific cd <dig> t cells were proliferating.

our data support a scenario in which neutralizing il- <dig> enhances the initial cd <dig> t cells, which in turn leads to an increased magnitude and maintenance of virus-specific cd <dig> t cells early in the response, possibly by sustained il- <dig> production. additionally, neutralizing il- <dig> may have direct effect on cd <dig> t cells, as indicated by the increased il-10r expression on virus-specific cd <dig> t cells . virus-specific cd <dig> t cells with enhanced cytolytic activity keep the initial virus levels low. at this early phase, antibody levels may play a minimal role. thirty days later, when the majority of cd <dig> t cells are rendered non-functional by the persistent virus, viremia is kept low by virus-specific antibodies. it is clear from our data that il- <dig> plays a critical role in inducing t cell anergy during persistent lcmvclone <dig> infections, and that its effect is most potent early in the immune response. neutralizing il- <dig> does not completely block immune tolerance or prevent viral persistence, suggesting that other factors are playing a significant role.

a potential criticism of the antibody-mediated il- <dig> neutralization studies is that il- <dig> was not blocked throughout the course of the virus-infection. perhaps continued il- <dig> blockade would have led to eventual clearance of virus. our experiments in il-10-/- mice unequivocally settle this issue. il- <dig> deficiency resulted in improved early adaptive immune responses similar to the antibody-mediated il- <dig> neutralization studies. however, with time, cd <dig> t cells from il-10-/- mice became non-functional and the mice were persistently infected. thus, whether by antibody- mediated neutralization or by genetic disruption, the removal of il- <dig> had a drastic stimulatory effect on the early antiviral cd8+ and cd4+ t cell responses but its effects were minimal later in the response. this finding leads us to conclude that il- <dig> exerts its strongest effect early during infection and other factors operate later during infection to bring about virus-induced t cell tolerance, such as tgf-β or pd- <dig> expression on cd <dig> t cells  <cit> .

inducing il- <dig> production in the host or encoding homologues of il- <dig> is a common strategy utilized by various pathogens to induce anergy in the host  <cit> . here we show that lcmvclone <dig> also uses this strategy to subvert the host immune response. lcmvclone <dig> differs from the armstrong strain by two amino acids, one in the polymerase and the other in the glycoprotein . the mutation in the polymerase enables the virus to replicate at a higher rate than lcmvarm  <cit> . interestingly, the mutation in gp alters its tropism. oldstone and colleagues have elegantly shown that lcmvclone <dig> infects dec205+ cd11c+ dendritic cells while lcmvarm fails to do so  <cit> . we speculate that infection of dcs with lcmvclone <dig> leads to il- <dig> production by these cells directly or, alternatively, infected dcs could induce regulatory t cells that in turn would secrete il- <dig>  our experiments clearly show that while il- <dig> is important for virus-induced tolerance induction, there must be other factor that are involved as well. whether these are il- <dig> family members  <cit>  such as il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il- <dig>  ak <dig> and mda- <dig> or immuno-modulatory cytokines such as tgf-β, remains to be investigated. clearly, ligation of pd- <dig> on cd <dig> t cells by pd-l <dig> and/or pd-l <dig> can have a suppressive effect, but the kinetics of co-stimulation and co-inhibition during chronic lcmvclone <dig> infections have not been clearly defined.

during the preparation of this manuscript, it has come to the attention of the authors that other laboratories have performed similar experiments with differing results . although the authors used a blocking antibody to il-10r that may have been more efficacious then neutralizing il- <dig> directly with different kinetics of administration, brooks et al. also performed lcmvclone <dig> infections in il- <dig> knockout mice and observed viral clearance. the route and amount of virus, as well as the genetic background of the il-10-/- mice, were reportedly identical to those used in our studies; as such, we have no explanation for the difference in outcome.

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented in this paper show that il- <dig> assists in generating t cell anergy to a viral infection, and that its role is perhaps most important during t cell priming. serum il- <dig> levels increased during chronic lcmv infections, and neutralizing il- <dig> with a monoclonal antibody resulted in improved antiviral cd <dig> and cd <dig> t cell responses, as well as antiviral b cell responses. in agreement with our antibody studies, chronically infected il- <dig> deficient mice displayed cd <dig> t cell responses that were indistinguishable from il-10-blocked mice: the early antiviral response was significantly enhanced. however, both il-10-blocked mice and il- <dig> deficient mice were eventually tolerized to lcmv, evidenced by the presence of anergic virus-specific cd <dig> t cells and persisting virus. these data suggest that although host-produced il- <dig> plays a role in generating virus-specific tolerance early during infection, other factors collaborate to completely tolerize cd <dig> t cells.
