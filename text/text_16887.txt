BACKGROUND
telomeres are nucleoprotein structures found at the ends of linear chromosomes and are critical for genome stability. in most eukaryotes, telomeric dna consists of multiple copies of simple sequences ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand base pairs. these sequences are usually g rich at the 3′ end and are extended by a specialized, self-templated reverse transcriptase, the telomerase. telomeres play two important roles:  they serve as substrates for telomerase and thus prevent the loss of sequences at the very end as would be expected for a linear sequence replicated by semi-conservative dna replication. this process is also precisely controlled in such a manner that only a designated amount of repeats are added and no uncontrolled elongation takes place.  they protect the ends from being recognized as double-strand breaks and from being attacked by nucleases. all these functions are carried out by multiple proteins that associate with the telomeres .

rif <dig>  was identified in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, as an interactor of the major telomere repeat sequence binding protein rap <dig>  <cit> . rif <dig> is a negative regulator of telomerase and together with another rap <dig> interacting protein, rif <dig>  it controls the access of telomerase to telomere ends for replication and elongation of telomere sequences  <cit> . accordingly, rif <dig> mutants have abnormally elongated telomeres. furthermore, in the absence of telomerase, rif <dig> inhibits the production of “type ii” survivors, which use the rad <dig> dependent recombination pathway to generate telomeres  <cit> . in yeast, rif <dig> protein has been localized predominantly to telomeres where it also antagonizes the establishment of silent chromatin  <cit> .

given the key role of rif <dig> in telomere biology, rif <dig> homologues have been identified in other yeasts as well. in schizosaccharomyces pombe, the rif <dig> orthologue, is recruited to telomeres via another telomere sequence binding protein taz <dig> and rif <dig> mutants have moderately elongated telomeres, suggesting that it is a negative regulator of telomere length  <cit> . however, as rif <dig> mutants in s. pombe show additive telomere length defects in rap <dig> mutants, it may work with taz <dig> in a parallel pathway with rap <dig> to control telomere length  <cit> . furthermore, rif <dig> has no effect on telomeric heterochromatin establishment in s. pombe. recently, rif <dig> orthologue from another budding yeast, candida glabrata, has been studied. although the effect on telomere length control by rif <dig> was not reported, it was shown that in c. glabrata, rif <dig> is essential for subtelomeric silencing  <cit> 

presence of rif <dig> orthologues in vertebrates points to the key role of this protein in eukaryotes. rif <dig> was first identified in mouse and was shown to be expressed at very high levels in totipotent and pluripotent cells, testes and was also associated with telomeres  <cit> . subsequently, human rif <dig>  was identified and these studies suggested a divergence in the functions of rif <dig>  <cit> . hrif <dig> associated with damaged dna, including dysfunctional telomeres. further studies established that hrif <dig> colocalized with several other dna-damage response factors and depletion of hrif <dig> led to radiation sensitivity and defects in s-phase checkpoint. additionally, through depletion studies in mouse cells, it has been demonstrated that mrif <dig> is essential and that it is involved in repair of stalled replication forks by homology directed repair  <cit> . hrif <dig> is upregulated in breast tumours and is proposed to be an anti-apoptotic factor required for dna repair  <cit> . more recently, hrif <dig> was copurified with blm helicase and was proposed to provide a dna binding interface for recruiting factors involved in initiation of replication at stalled forks  <cit> .

the studies from yeast to mammals show that rif <dig> function has evolved from a protein that specifically participated in replication of the special dna sequences present at the telomeres to a more general role in dna damage response and reinitiation of replication at stalled replication forks. drosophila, unlike mammals and yeasts, does not have simple sequence repeats at the telomeres. instead they maintain their telomeres through the transposition of specialized non-ltr retroposons, namely, het-a, tart and tahre  <cit> . a putative rif <dig> homologue in drosophila has been reported based on sequence similarities to yeast rif <dig> though its function has not been tested  <cit> . the presence of a rif <dig> homologue in drosophila suggests an early evolution of this telomeric protein to perform non-telomere related functions.

we performed a detailed bioinformatic analysis of drosophila rif <dig>  to understand the evolutionary history of this protein. we found that rif <dig> is conserved in all eukaryotes and drif <dig> is closer to vertebrate rif <dig> than yeast. a few conserved motifs were identified in the protein which will be helpful in elucidating the molecular basis of its function. we have followed the bioinformatic analyses with experimental test of conserved functions. we find that drosophila and vertebrate rif <dig> differ in their interaction with yeast telomeres and their response to dna damage. our data suggest that this protein has acquired additional domains in vertebrates and consequently additional roles.

RESULTS
rif <dig> homologues are conserved across eukaryotes
the rif <dig> protein sequence of human and yeast were used for finding the homologues in ncbi protein sequence database. by this approach we found rif <dig> homologues in  <dig> different organisms, including  <dig> fungal species,  <dig> insects and  <dig> vertebrate species . in addition, we found the homologues in hydra magnipapillata , trichoplax adhaerens  and saccoglossus kowalevskii . phylogenetic tree constructed using the protein sequences of rif <dig> shows an evolutionary pattern from lower to higher organisms  and indicates that the insect homologues are closer to human than fungal rif <dig>  we did not find clear homologues of rif <dig> in plants, although a related protein in a lycophyte, selaginella moellendorffii, was detected. while search with this lycophyte protein sequence in plants returned several uncharacterized proteins showing reasonable similarity , these proteins lack the key conserved silk/pp <dig> interaction domain . we therefore deemed the plant homologues to be too diverged for further analysis.

conserved motifs in rif <dig> homologues
we found three motifs, namely, heat repeat, silk motif and a domain present in the c-terminal end which was shown to have dna binding property  <cit> , that are conserved across the species from yeast to mammals in rif <dig> . in addition, previously predicted blm helicase interaction domain is conserved only in the vertebrates  <cit> . heat repeat is a structural domain with poor sequence homology and is present in several proteins  <cit> . it spans ~ <dig> amino acids in rif <dig> homologues  <cit> . in our detailed analysis we found a highly conserved region of 101– <dig> amino acids present within the heat repeat that is rif <dig> specific . this domain is also present in the putative homologues identified in plants.

our analysis identified another novel feature, silk motif or protein phosphatase  interaction domain, in all rif <dig> homologues . the highly conserved residues rvxf were also detected along with the silk motif, which is the docking motif essential for pp <dig> interaction  <cit> . earlier studies have shown that the silk motif is specifically associated with rvxf motif in certain class of pp <dig> interacting proteins  <cit> . in all rif <dig> homologues, we found silk and rvxf combination to be present with varying length of amino acid sequences between them. recently, a large scale proteomics study revealed that the mammalian rif <dig> interacts with pp <dig> by affinity chromatography  <cit> , indicating that rif <dig> is a target of pp <dig>  interestingly, the silk-rvxf domain at the n-terminal end of rif <dig> homologues of fungi is present at the c-terminal end of multi-cellular eukaryotes . thus there has been a swapping of silk motif in rif <dig> from n-terminal end to c-terminal end during the course of evolution. this shift is seen from placozoans onwards, which are the basal group of multi-cellular organisms . additionally, in single cell organisms, when the silk motif is seen in the n-terminus its architecture is ‘silk-rvxf’; but in multi cellular organisms the motif is shifted to c-terminus and the architecture is reversed to ‘rvxf-silk’. based on the architecture and position of the silk domain, we again find that the drosophila homologue is closer to vertebrates than yeasts . further analysis of other proteins carrying silk/pp <dig> interaction domain in human, yeast and drosophila showed that the internal swapping of the motifs giving the two architectures of this domain is not unique to rif <dig> .

a unique dna binding domain was reported in hrif <dig> which helps in bringing the blm helicase to the stalled replication forks  <cit> . we found that this domain is conserved from yeast to human . although the sequence homology of rif <dig> is poor between unicellular and multicellular organisms, the profile based search strongly supports the conservation of this dna binding domain between these two groups of organisms. blm interaction domain was also reported in the study of hrif <dig> by xu et al.  <cit> . our analysis shows that this domain is conserved only in vertebrates .

in summary, our bioinformatic analyses identified several interesting features of rif <dig>  we report for the first time the conservation of silk-rvxf motif in rif <dig> from all organisms. we also identify a rif <dig> specific core heat repeat present in all organisms. the conservation of features of the putative dna binding domain across species again emphasizes the evolution of the protein from the core sequence and it is important to test if the dna binding function is also retained.

drif <dig> is localized to the nucleus and is prominently associated with heterochromatin
in order to functionally characterize drif <dig>  we raised polyclonal antibodies against a part of the protein. the antibody recognized a protein of approximately 160 kda, as expected, in drosophila embryo derived s <dig> cell extract . we performed immunolocalization of drif <dig> in s <dig> cells to see the subcellular localization, and found that rif <dig> was nuclear localized . drif <dig> stained the nucleus in a heterogenous manner, with most nuclei showing one or two prominent dark patches along with a diffuse nuclear staining. as the same regions also appeared to contain dense dna staining, we tested if this patch corresponded to heterochromatin. we colocalized drif <dig> with the heterochromatin marker, histone h <dig> trimethyl lysine  <dig>  as shown in figure 3c, we found that drif <dig> associates with heterochromatin prominently in s <dig> cells.

drif <dig> does not relocalize upon dna damage induction in s <dig> cells
immunolocalization of human rif <dig> shows a diffuse nuclear staining. multiple forms of dna damage, including ionising radiation, hydroxy urea, mms, etoposide, aphidicolin cause hrif <dig> to relocalize into foci, which often coincide with the damage sites  <cit> . to test if drif <dig> also responds to damaged dna in a similar manner, we treated s <dig> cells with hydroxy urea and aphidicolin and asked if drif <dig> relocalized to halted replication forks. cells were costained with γ-h2avd antibodies to mark the sites of damaged dna. in contrast to what has been observed in human cells, we did not see any major relocalization of drif <dig> with either hydoxy urea or aphidicolin treatment . dna damage foci that showed strong γ-h2avd staining were prominent in the treated cells showing that treatment did induce dna damage. same results were obtained with mms and uv treatments . therefore, drif <dig>  unlike hrif <dig>  does not relocalize upon dna damage.

the experiments described above showed that drif <dig> does not respond to dna damage by localizing to the repair sites. however, in order to test this more directly, we carried out knock down experiments using double-stranded rna. three different primer sets with no off targets were designed for drif <dig>  we used dsrna of gfp for the mock treatment experiments. we did two successive rounds of dsrna treatment and performed both western blot and immunofluorescence studies and confirmed that drif <dig> protein levels decreased to undetectable levels by the sixth day . cells remained healthy and continued to divide for several days after dsrna treatment. these knockdown cells were treated with dna damage inducing agents, hu and bleomycin. after treatment we stained the cells for γ-h2avd and drif <dig>  first, we did not find any difference in viability between mock treated and double stranded drif <dig> rna treated cells upon induction of dna damage. second, upon staining for γ-h2avd, we found several spots come up on dna damage induction . we compared the levels of γ-h2avd between wild type and knock down cells by western blots . our results show, both by immunofluorescence and by western blots, that repair foci  occur normally in the absence of drif <dig>  these data further strengthen our conclusions that unlike human rif <dig>  drosophila rif <dig> does not participate in dna damage response by translocating to the sites of repair.

knock down of drif <dig> does not influence telomere transcription in s <dig> cells
as yrif <dig> represses transcription of telomeric repeat containing transcripts   <cit>  and is involved in telomere position effect in c. glabrata, we asked if telomere specific transcript levels are under drif <dig> control in drosophila. drosophila telomeres have retrotransposon elements that are generally transcriptionally suppressed and are activated by mutations that inactivate telomere position effect and rasirna pathway, indicating that they are under strict transcriptional repression . we isolated rna from wild type and knock down cells and performed quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr for transcripts from telomere associated transposons  <cit> .we do find low levels of transcripts in wild type cells and this level is not significantly affected by knock down of rif <dig> . this result suggests that drif <dig> is unlikely to regulate telomere retrotransposon transcript levels in s <dig> cells.

drif <dig> does not complement telomere function in yeast
the bioinformatic analyses presented above show that rif <dig> is conserved throughout eukaryotes. however, as shown above, we found that drif <dig> responded differently to dna damage in comparison to human rif <dig>  to test how much of the core functional properties of yeast rif <dig> are retained in drosophila, we performed cross complementation assays. to this end the full length drif <dig> was expressed under the control of yeast rif <dig> promoter and transformed into wild type, rif1rif <dig> and rif1rif <dig> mutant yeast strains and the telomere length was estimated. yeast lacking rif1p have much longer telomeres than wild type cells  <cit> . as seen in figure  <dig>  wild type cells have compact telomeres around  <dig>  kb  rif <dig>  and rif <dig>  mutations increase the length of the telomeres considerably, with rif <dig> mutants showing more pronounced effects. the double mutants have an additive effect and the telomeres are extremely long and disperse . single copy expression of yeast rif <dig> is able to complement rif <dig> phenotype ; however, drif <dig> does not change the telomere length in any of these strains . apart from telomere length, yeast rif <dig> has a negative regulation on telomere position effect . therefore, we tested whether tpe in yeast is perturbed by drif <dig> expression. however, drif <dig> expression does not affect tpe either . this suggests that the drosophila protein does not retain much functional similarity to its yeast counterpart and therefore, cannot complement yrif <dig> in telomere maintenance. this is in contrast to hrif <dig>  which increases telomere length in rif <dig> mutants  <cit> . these data lead us to speculate that unlike hrif <dig>  drosophila rif <dig>  has lost the ability to interact with and interfere with telomere length regulation in yeast.

as a further test of functional conservation of drif <dig>  we determined the subcellular localization of drif <dig> when expressed in yeast. we first confirmed by western blot analysis that drif <dig> was expressed in yeast cells. as seen in figure 7a, flag-tagged rif <dig> could be detected in yeast. empty vector or flag-tagged drif <dig> was transformed into yeast strains that express myc-tagged sir <dig> protein. sir <dig>  silent information regulator  <dig> protein, localizes to telomeric clusters and appears as  <dig> to  <dig> bright foci in the nuclei. these strains were fixed and immunofluorescence experiments were performed using flag  and myc  antibodies. we found that 20– <dig> percent of the cells have clear nuclear signal for drif <dig>  showing that drif <dig> localizes to the nucleus in yeast . empty vector transformed control cells did not show any signal for drif <dig>  however, there was no colocalization of the drif <dig> with sir <dig> protein. therefore we conclude that drif <dig> protein does not localize to the telomeres in yeast and this also explains the failure of drif <dig> in complementing its yeast counterpart in our previous experiments. since hrif <dig> has been shown to localize to aberrant, unprotected human telomeres, we tested drif <dig> localization in yku <dig> mutants as yku <dig> mutant have damaged telomeres; but no relocalization of drif <dig> to these sites could be detected . there were two interesting features about drif <dig> localization in yeast. first, only a subset seemed to show drif <dig> staining, suggesting that not all cells were expressing drif <dig>  second, drif <dig> localized to a distinct compartment within the nucleus, which is neither telomeres, nor nucleolus. this novel site usually appeared as bright spot in the nucleus and sometimes appeared as a ring. such novel site localization has recently been reported for slx <dig>  a component of the ubiqutin e <dig> ligase complex that targets sumoylated proteins and reported to have roles in dna damage response  <cit> 

mammalian rif <dig> is localized to the nucleus and relocalizes to the dna damage/repair foci  <cit> . we induced dna damage in yeast cells expressing drif <dig> by incubating the overnight grown cultures with  <dig> %mms and checked for the drif <dig> localization pattern upon dna damage . we found that the staining remained the same and rif <dig> retained its unique pattern; although now most of the nuclei showed the more prominent ring like localization unlike the prominent spot or small ring staining in the untreated cell nuclei. as reported, the sir4p spots became more diffuse  <cit> . these data suggest that drif <dig> does not relocalize to dna damage sites in yeast as well.

drif <dig> does not co-localize with dna damage sites in human cells
the lack of relocalization of drif <dig> to sites of damage in yeast could be either due to lack of conservation of the partners or pathways in yeast or alternatively might indicate lack of conservation of this function in drif <dig>  in order to distinguish between the two possibilities, we expressed flag-drif <dig> in hela cells. the full-length drif <dig> along with 3xflag was cloned in pcmv vector and transfected into hela cells. since drif <dig> colocalized with heterochromatin in s <dig> cells, we stained drif <dig> using flag antibody to confirm transfection and also co-stained with h3k9me <dig> antibody as heterochromatin marker. we did not find any significant colocalization of drif <dig> with heterochromatin in hela cells . after 24 hrs of transfection, the cells were treated with hu for 16 hrs or bleomycin for  <dig> hours and both treated and untreated cells were stained with antibodies to 53bp <dig> and flag. untreated control cells showed clear nuclear localization of flag tagged drif <dig> where as 53bp <dig> showed one or two foci .

when hela cells were treated with hu  or bleomycin , we found that damage sites were marked with 53bp <dig>  eventhough hrif <dig> has been shown to accumulate at such damage foci, we observed that drif <dig> did not accumulate in these sites  <cit> . an interesting feature of expressing drif <dig> protein in hela cells was that when a larger amount of protein was expressed, the nuclei appeared deformed and additionally, did not show large 53bp <dig> spots or foci upon hu or bleomycin treatment. however, in cells not expressing drif <dig>  or expressing low levels of drif <dig>  prominent 53bp <dig> spots were observed, even though drif <dig> did not colocalize with these damage spots, indirectly suggesting that drif <dig> protein possibly interfered with the normal dna damage response of hela cells. these data along with our previous result showing that drif <dig> does not accumulate at dna damage sites in drosophila cells as well, suggest that the drosophila homologue may not respond to dna damage in the same manner as the human homologue.

discussion
rif <dig> was identified in yeast almost two decades ago, and genetic and biochemical studies have clearly shown that it is a negative regulator of telomerase. emerging evidence shows that rif <dig> in mammals has diverged from its primary role in telomere synthesis and maintenance to a broader role in response to dna damage. in this work we initiated a study on the drosophila homologue of rif <dig>  our detailed analysis of rif <dig> from multiple organisms has identified several novel features. drosophila rif <dig> is evolutionarily closer to vertebrate rif <dig> than yeast rif <dig>  all rif <dig> homologues contain the conserved heat-repeats and this may carry out the core rif <dig> activities. as this domain has been implicated in interacting with proteins, it might recruit a variety of proteins to carry out its functions. within these heat repeats, our studies identify a conserved rif <dig> specific repeat and this might be useful in identifying the core conserved interacting partners. the more diverse repeats are likely to facilitate participation in other functions. our analysis also identified a conserved silk motif, again present in all organisms, from yeast to humans. as this motif has been retained in all species, this is likely to participate in the core rif <dig> functions. drif <dig> lacks the c-terminal blm interaction domain but contains all the conserved features associated with the n-terminal region.

drif <dig> encodes for a 160 kda protein that is localized to the nucleus. we find that a large fraction of the protein is associated with heterochromatin. in budding yeasts, yrif <dig> is predominantly associated with telomeric heterochromatin, although it is not required for establishment or maintenance of telomeric heterochromatin  <cit> . a very recent report implicates yrif <dig> in heterochromatin establishment at the silent mating type loci  <cit>  and genome wide chromatin immunoprecipitation studies also show that yrif <dig> is associated with the silent mating type loci  <cit> . rif <dig> in human cell lines were also shown to be associated with arrested replication forks in the vicinity of pericentromeric heterochromatin although this was not observed in unperturbed cells  <cit> . these results taken together implicate a possible evolutionarily conserved role for rif <dig> at the heterochromatin.

we find that knock down of drif <dig> does not lead to any difference in response to dna damage in s <dig> cells suggesting that drif <dig> is unlikely to function at repair sites. drosophila and human rif <dig> behave differently in yeast: whereas human rif <dig> interferes with telomere length in yeast  <cit> , drosophila rif <dig> does not. this suggests that human rif <dig> has possibly retained its ability to interact with telomeric partners of rif <dig>  possibly rap <dig>  and drosophila rif <dig> has lost that ability perhaps, because unlike yeasts and vertebrates, drosophila does not have rap <dig>  in this context, it is important to note that out of the  <dig> genomic targets identified for rif <dig> in yeast, only about  <dig>  mostly telomeric, colocalize with rap <dig>  suggesting there are a large number of rap <dig> independent targets for rif <dig> even in yeast  <cit> . we speculate that telomere independent functions of rif <dig> are conserved in drosophila and yeast and need to be explored.

interestingly, upon dna damage, drif <dig> does not associate with the dna repair foci although human rif <dig> does. in fact, presence of drif <dig> reduces the formation of dna repair foci in hela cells. the c-terminus of vertebrate rif <dig> has now been shown to interact with the blm complex and also contain a dna binding domain  <cit> . however, the drosophila homologue does not have the extended c-terminus that carries out the critical functions of association with blm protein. this suggests that drosophila rif <dig> may not have the ability to associate with replication forks and the differential response of drif <dig> and human rif <dig> to the presence of stalled replication forks are consistent with this.

the retention of rif <dig> homologue in drosophila raises an important question as to when and how rif <dig> function diversified. as telomerase based telomere maintenance was replaced by alternate mechanisms of maintenance in many insects including drosophila, telomerase and associated proteins have no counterparts in these organisms  <cit> . however, presence of rif <dig> in drosophila suggests that the recruitment of rif <dig> to non-telomere based roles happened before drosophila lost telomerase. alternatively it might mean that rif <dig> has both a telomeric and an evolutionarily conserved non-telomeric role in yeast. even in yeast, only the c-terminus of rif <dig> has been shown to interact with rap <dig> and rif <dig> proteins. the conserved n-terminal domain containing heat repeats has so far not been implicated in any function. could this domain hold the clue to the evolutionarily conserved role of rif1? even though rif <dig> was found as a negative regulator of telomerase, it has now been implicated in many more  functions like in telomere protection, recombination mediated telomere maintenance and repression of telomere specific transcripts  <cit> . however a molecular or biochemical basis underlying these functions is lacking. no specific motifs have been identified in rif <dig> that could predict a biochemical function. indeed there has been no structure –function analyses performed for any of the diverse rif <dig> functions in yeast. comparing the sequences of rif <dig> throughout eukaryotes and experimental data obtained for rif <dig> from the various model systems, it appears that the core conserved region of rif <dig>  the heat repeats and silk motifs, warrant special attention. studies in a genetically and developmentally tractable system like drosophila will give us an additional important handle to understand the function of this conserved protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have carried out a detailed bioinformatic analysis of rif <dig> and show that it is evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes. our study shows that within the heat repeats, there is a core rif <dig> specific repeat region that is present in all the rif <dig> homologues. a pp <dig> docking motif has also been identified in all rif <dig> homologues. drif <dig> is localized to the nucleus and shows a prominent heterochromatin association. it does not localize to foci induced by dna damage. when tested for functional conservation of rif <dig> function in drif <dig>  we find that it does not perturb or complement yeast rif <dig> and does not relocalize to dna damage foci in hela cells. the novel motifs identified in this study give a new perspective to investigate rif <dig> functions, especially with respect to pp <dig> interactions and heterochromatin associations. secondly, whether responding to dna damage or binding to stalled replications forks is a newly acquired vertebrate specific function of rif <dig> needs to be examined. this would suggest a further evolution and sub-functionalization of an ancient protein.
