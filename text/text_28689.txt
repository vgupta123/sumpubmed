BACKGROUND
integrins are a large family of cell surface transmembrane receptors known only from metazoans, which function in intracellular signalling as well as cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix  adhesion  <cit> . as the main mediators of cell-ecm interactions they are key players in early development  <cit>  functioning in gastrulation by rapid modulation of their own adhesion between low and high affinity states and by modulating the activities of adhesion molecules  in cell layers undergoing convergence and extension  <cit> .

integrins function as αβ heterodimers with several subunits of each type being present in most animals. analyses of the whole genome sequence of caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  indicate that it has a single β subunit of the β <dig> type that is capable of associating with two α subunits, which confer specificity for either laminin- or rgd-containing ligands, and it has been suggested that this may reflect the ancestral state. drosophila melanogaster has five α and two β subunits  <cit>  and mammals, eighteen α and eight β integrin subunits  <cit> . in each case, however, integrin subunits above and beyond likely orthologs of the two αs and one β of caenorhabditis are clearly lineage-specific. "lower" animals are of particular significance in terms of understanding the ancestral state, but have not been extensively studied. both α and β integrin subunits have been identified in sponges  <cit> , and cnidarians  <cit> , but the extent of integrin diversity and the range of functions of these molecules in "lower" animals are unknown.

anthozoan cnidarians such as the coral acropora millepora and the sea anemone nematostella vectensis appear to have retained much of the genetic complexity of the metazoan common ancestor  <cit> ; hence these animals are likely to be highly informative with respect to the ancestral integrin complement and may provide insights into the original roles of these molecules. known cnidarian integrins include a β integrin from acropora millepora  <cit>  and single α and β subunits  from the hydrozoan jellyfish podocoryne carnea  <cit> . here we report the characterisation of novel β and α integrins from acropora. the known acropora integrins are expressed during gastrulation in patterns like those seen at the corresponding stages of echinoderm and amphibian development. however, we know from morphological observation  <cit>  that acropora gastrulation is not a simple epithelial to mesenchymal transition in which the expressing cells lose their adhesivity and invaginate. instead, in acropora it is clear that changing cell shape also plays a major role <cit> . two further implications of this work are that the cnidarian integrin complement is significantly more complex than was predicted, and that functional diversification of α integrins may have occurred independently in cnidaria and bilateria.

RESULTS
identification of novel integrins
three unigenes encoding integrin subunits were identified during an ongoing est analysis of acropora millepora  <cit> . one of these corresponds to the previously known acropora integrin β cn <dig>  <cit> ; to simplify comparative analyses, this integrin is henceforth referred to as amitgβ <dig>  complete sequences were determined for cdna clones corresponding to the other two integrin unigenes; comparative analyses indicated that an est clone corresponding to a second β subunit  encodes a full length protein of  <dig> amino acids, whilst an α integrin est clone lacked the 5' end of the open reading frame. to complete the  <dig> amino acid integrin α coding sequence, overlapping clones were isolated from a cdna library, enabling the determination of the complete open reading frame for a molecule designated amitgα <dig>  these sequences have been submitted to genbank under the following accession numbers: eu <dig>  and eu <dig> .

amitgβ <dig> is a possible coral ortholog of a known jellyfish integrin β
database comparisons identified amitgβ <dig> as a possible ortholog of integrin β  from podocoryne  <cit> . previously reber-muller et al.  <cit>  suggested that podocoryne intb was orthologous with amitgβ1; however, the former not only has higher overall sequence identity with amitgβ <dig> , but also shows the same atypical pattern of cysteine residues  whereas the β integrin extracellular domain characteristically contains  <dig> cysteine residues arranged in a specific pattern  <cit> , in both podocoryne intb  <cit>  and amitgβ <dig>  cysteine residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the canonical structure are absent as occurs in vertebrate β4-type integrins. in terms of most other structural features, however, both amitgβ <dig> and podocoryne intb are typical integrin βs – the midas domain, cysteine-rich stalk and transmembrane region are all clearly present. in both cases, the dxsxs motif of the midas cation-binding domain  <cit>  is completely conserved, whereas the ddl motif of the admidas is changed to edl in amitgβ <dig> . the cytoplasmic domains contain the conserved membrane proximal sequence kllxxxxd and two npxy/f motifs . whereas the degree of similarity between these acropora and podocoryne sequences implies that these might be orthologs, one complicating factor is that the nematostella genome appears to encode two integrins of the amitgβ <dig> type . hence orthology relationships will only be clear when more complete datasets are available for acropora and podocoryne.

amitgα <dig> is a cnidarian integrin resembling the vertebrate α4/9-type
comparative analyses indicate that amitgα <dig> shares some characteristics with those integrin α subunits that lack an α-a  domain. database comparisons revealed that amitgα <dig> is most similar to mouse integrin α <dig> . whereas the acropora and podocoryne β integrins that are possible orthologs  are 44% identical, the α subunits amitgα <dig> and podocoryne inta have a much lower amino acid identity , and there are several differences between these that are likely to have functional and/or structural significance. both proteins are typical in terms of the presence of fg-gap repeats, transmembrane regions, membrane proximal kxgffkr motifs and extracellular cleavage sites fitting the rxk/rr consensus . however, whereas amitgα <dig> is typical in having three cation binding motifs  within fg-gap repeats v, vi, and vii, the three cation binding sites in podocoryne inta are in fg-gap repeats vi, vii and immediately c-terminal of repeat vii. both proteins are atypical in terms of the positions of cysteine residues relative to the consensus; amitgα <dig> is missing cys residues at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  whereas intb is missing cys residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  but both proteins have a novel cys pair between consensus positions  <dig> and  <dig>  a corresponding extra pair of cys residues is also present at the same position in both the nematostella α integrin predicted from the genome sequence  and the atypical drosophila integrin ps <dig> 

phylogenetic analyses of the novel integrin sequences
to better understand relationships between the acropora sequences and the major integrin types of higher animals, maximum likelihood  phylogenetic analyses were undertaken using molphy version  <dig>   <cit> . integrin phylogenetics is complicated by high levels of primary sequence divergence and homoplasy, leading to difficulties in unambiguous alignment of sequences. the analyses presented here are therefore based on extensively edited alignments. sequences were aligned using clustalw via the ebi website, manually edited using jalview, and used for phylogenetic analyses. in the case of the integrin α alignment, the output from clustalw consisted of  <dig> positions and was manually edited to  <dig> positions . the corresponding figures for the integrin β alignments were  <dig> positions prior to editing and  <dig> after editing .

the ml phylogenetic analyses of integrin α sequences  are broadly consistent with previous studies; the resolution of bilaterian sequences into two major clades corresponding to the major ligand classes rgd  and laminin  is strongly supported. the fact that these two clades each contain protostome  and deuterostome  sequences indicates that the functional divergence of α integrins had already occurred in urbilateria – the common ancestor of bilateral  animals. however, the ml phylogenetic analyses give no clear indication of the likely ligand specificity of the known cnidarian α integrins. the cnidarian  α integrins group together with high bootstrap support , the sister group of this cnidarian integrin α clade being the α4/ <dig> type integrins .

ml analyses of the integrin β sequences  confirmed the possible orthology of podocoryne intb with the novel acropora β sequence  reported here. preliminary surveys of the genome sequence of nematostella suggest the presence of at least four β integrins, and gene models  of these were sufficiently complete for them to be included in phylogenetic analyses  which group the nematostella β integrins with the acropora subunits – two with amitgβ <dig> and two with amitgβ <dig>  it remains to be seen whether each member of these pairs of nematostella genes has an acropora ortholog. as in the integrin α phylogeny, the sponge sequences were relatively distant to those from the cnidaria. again, the analyses were broadly consistent with previous studies  <cit> , resolving the vertebrate sequences into three clades known as β <dig> , β <dig>  and β <dig> in the hughes  <cit>  phylogeny. unlike the α integrins, there is no evidence for divergence of β subunits prior to the protostome/deuterostome split. rather, it appears more likely that β integrins have diverged independently in several bilaterian lineages.

expression of integrins during coral gastrulation
rt-pcr analysis demonstrates that mrnas encoding each of the coral integrins  are present in eggs  and early developmental stages  at relatively uniform levels. no specific pattern could be detected via in situ hybridization prior to the prawn chip stage however, implying that the maternal mrna is uniformly distributed until this time. in the early development of acropora, a clear and specific in situ hybridization pattern for amitgα <dig> is first seen in late prawn chip stage embryos  , the mrna being localized in a characteristic pattern on the concave side of the flattened cell bilayer corresponding to fig. 4b in hayward et al.  <cit> . expression is maintained in these presumptive endodermal cells as the concavity deepens and they are internalized. staining remains strong in the presumptive endoderm until blastopore closure is complete , after which only weak endodermal staining of amitgα <dig> is observed.

the early expression patterns of both amitgβ <dig> and amitgβ <dig>  were broadly similar to that of amitgα <dig>  but with the following differences. first, it was only possible to visualize the localization of transcripts corresponding to the β integrins at slightly later stages of development. second, whereas amitgα <dig> and amitgβ <dig> transcripts were tightly restricted at the area of the blastopore lip in early gastrulae , amitgβ <dig> was also expressed more generally .

discussion
whereas reber-muller et al.  <cit>  hypothesized the presence of only single α and β integrin subunits in cnidarians, the integrins identified to date in acropora are likely to be only a subset of those present. preliminary surveys of the genome of nematostella imply that at least four β integrins , and at least three distinct α types are present . however, gene models for only one α integrin were sufficiently complete to allow its inclusion in the phylogenetic analyses shown as fig 5a. the integrin repertoire of this morphologically simple animal is therefore considerably more complex than that of caenorhabditis , which has often been assumed to reflect the ancestral metazoan state.

due to structural constraints on integrin proteins during evolution, phylogenetic analyses are likely to be complicated by homoplasy effects. the position of the cnidarian sequences in the α integrin phylogeny  is likely due to both the early divergence of the cnidaria and homoplasy effects. hence, in this case, phylogenetics is not informative as to ligand binding properties. it is likely that in cnidarians, as in higher animals, distinct α integrin types participate in binding to laminin and rgd-containing ligands, but functional analyses are required to verify this hypothesis.

despite having a common pattern of cysteine loss, phylogenetic analyses  indicate that amitgβ <dig> is only distantly related to the vertebrate β4-type. those cysteine residues  in the consensus absent from the acropora and podocoryne sequences form the c8–c <dig> loop of the β a domain, which has been implicated in determining integrin-ligand specificity, specificity of α-β interactions, and signalling properties  <cit> . whilst this loss has apparently occurred independently of that leading to the vertebrate β <dig> type, it may result in common consequences for ligand and/or α-subunit specificity.

the presence of maternal integrin mrnas and their relatively uniform expression through development reported here for acropora have precedents in podocoryne  <cit>  as well as in higher animals. co-localization of mrnas for amitgβ <dig>  amitgβ <dig> and amitgα <dig> suggests that either or both of the β subunits associate with the α <dig> subunit. there are many precedents from bilaterians for rgd-type αs associating with β1-type βs . of these, α5β <dig> and ps2βps have been implicated as regulators of gastrulation in vertebrates  <cit>  and drosophila  <cit>  respectively. in podocoryne, inta is assumed to associate with intb  since they are co-expressed in a wide variety of locations over a range of life cycle stages  <cit> , suggesting that amitgβ <dig> may associate with the amitgα <dig> subunit.

although integrins clearly play important roles in gastrulation in several animal groups, including vertebrates  <cit> , drosophila  <cit> , and sea urchins  <cit> , the interactions that have been demonstrated are heterogeneous with respect to both the ligands and types of integrins involved. the expression patterns of α and β integrin genes observed in the coral are reminiscent of expression during both amphibian and sea urchin gastrulation. modulation of integrin adhesion to the rgd domain of fibronectin plays a central role during xenopus gastrulation  <cit> , and in the sea urchin lytechinus changes in laminin adhesion mediated by the epithelial α integrin α su <dig> are likewise important  <cit> . in both the sea urchin and xenopus, changes in integrin-mediated cell adhesion during gastrulation occur independently of transcription and translation. in acropora, integrin mrnas are present in eggs  <cit>  and the extent to which those visualized in the presumptive endoderm reflect zygotic transcription is unknown.

the simplest interpretation of the patterns of integrin expression is that they reflect increases in cell adhesion in the presumptive endoderm. expression on the concave side of the "fat prawn chip" stage embryo, which is essentially a flat bilayer of cells , suggests that integrin-based adhesion may constrain the presumptive endoderm whilst the cells of the presumptive ectoderm move upward and inward around them. whilst the cells that will end up inside the embryo may adhere to each other more tightly than they do to the putative ectoderm, as is consistent with many forms of gastrulation, the inferred increased adhesion in the putative endoderm is not consistent with a typical epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

the early expression patterns of the α and β integrins in acropora are very similar to those of two transcription factors, snaila  <cit>  and otxb  <cit> . snail genes have central and conserved roles in gastrulation in drosophila  <cit>  and vertebrates  <cit>  and members of the broader class of related genes are regulators of other epithelial to mesenchymal transitions . whilst the best understood means by which snail genes regulate cell adhesion is by acting as repressors of e-cadherin expression  <cit> , in human epidermal keratinocytes the snail-related gene slug  is a repressor of α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> integrin expression, leading to decreased cell-adhesion to fibronectin and laminin  <dig>  <cit> . across the bilateria, otx genes are conserved anterior markers  <cit>  and, whilst most otx genes are expressed in the nervous system, evidence from a diverse range of metazoans suggests an ancient role as regulators of cell adhesion . in hydra, high levels of cnotx expression correspond to regions where cells are undergoing rearrangements or movement  <cit> . both snaila and otxb are thus candidate regulators of integrin expression in acropora. given the similarity of amitgα <dig> to diverged rgd-type mammalian integrins, it will be of particular interest to examine the expression of ecm proteins containing fibronectin type iii domains during cnidarian gastrulation in parallel with adhesion studies. candidates identified in nematostella include predicted proteins similar to vertebrate usherin and titin, and a likely homolog of drosophila sidekick.

CONCLUSIONS
whilst one might expect morphologically simple metazoans to have a correspondingly basic integrin complement, comprising perhaps just two αs and a single β subunit , the repertoire of these molecules in anthozoan cnidarians is considerably more complex. in the case of cnidarian α integrins, ligand specificity cannot be predicted by phylogenetic analysis, suggesting the possibility that specificity mechanisms arose independently in cnidaria and bilateria. during early development in acropora, some of these adhesion/signalling molecules are expressed in patterns which parallel those of their amphibian and echinoderm counterparts, and which are inconsistent with gastrulation being a simple epithelial to mesenchymal transition.
