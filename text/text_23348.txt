BACKGROUND
aflatoxins  are highly carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by aspergillus species such as a. flavus and a. parasiticus after invading plants or stored grains. contaminations of these toxins in the food chain pose serious threats to humans and animals  <cit> . previous studies focused on understanding the molecular machinery of af biosynthesis  <cit> , which have shown that most genes involved in the production of af are located in a co-regulated gene cluster that encodes two regulatory proteins  and at least  <dig> down-stream metabolic enzymes  <cit> . an independently regulated sugar utilization gene cluster is located adjacently  <cit> .

some environmental factors and chemical reagents are known to be able to inhibit af production  <cit> . sugar is the most frequently used carbohydrate for studying af production  <cit> . it has been proposed that the key factor determining if a carbohydrate supports af production is its metabolic availability to the hexose monophosphate shunt and glycolysis pathway  <cit> . we thus speculate that sugar analogs that are unable to be utilized by a. flavus are candidate inhibitors for af biosynthesis. chemical analogs are often used to inhibit metabolism, as they may bind competitively to the active or allosteric sites of enzymes and hamper their activities  <cit> . three glucose analogs, 2-deoxyglucose, α-methyglucoside and glucosamine, have been tested in a. parasiticus previously, but none of them inhibited af production when applied to a glucose-containing medium  <cit> .

d-glucal and d-galactal are cyclic enol ether derivatives of glucose and galactose, respectively . in this study we examined in a. flavus for their effects on af biosynthesis. it has been reported that d-glucal inhibits glucose oxidase   <cit> , while d-galactal inhibits β-d-galactopyranosidase   <cit> . whether these compounds have any effects on glycolysis and/or af biosynthesis is not known. results obtained in this study showed that d-glucal, but not d-galactal, is able to inhibit af biosynthesis and to enhance kojic acid biosynthesis without affecting mycelial growth. the inhibition occurred before the production of norsolorinic acid , the first stable intermediate in the af biosynthetic pathway. metabolomics studies suggested that the glycolysis pathway was inhibited in mycelia grown in the presence of d-glucal. using quantitative reverse transcription-pcr , we showed that exogenous d-glucal suppressed expression of af biosynthetic genes tested but enhanced expression of kojic acid biosynthetic genes.

RESULTS
use of d-glucal and d-galactal as the sole carbohydrate source did not support mycelial growth
the usual gms medium used for culturing a. flavus contains 50 mg/ml glucose  <cit> . to examine if d-glucal and d-galactal could be used as the sole carbohydrate for mycelial growth, we replaced the glucose in the medium with  <dig> or 40 mg/ml d-glucal or d-galactal. media containing either  <dig> or 40 mg/ml d-glucose were used as the control. after incubation of a. flavus a  <dig>  spores in these media for  <dig> d, we observed no mycelial growth in media with d-glucal or d-galactal, while abundant mycelial growth was observed in those two controls . no further growth was observed in media with d-glucal or d-galactal even when the incubation period was extended to  <dig> d, suggesting neither these two sugar analogs support mycelial growth when used as the sole carbohydrate.

d-glucal inhibited af biosynthesis and sporulation without affecting mycelial growth in gms media
to test whether d-glucal or d-galactal inhibit af biosynthesis, spores of a. flavus a  <dig>  were inoculated in gms liquid media  supplied with  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 40 mg/ml of d-glucal or d-galactal and cultured at 28°c for  <dig> d. gms media with the same amounts of additional d-glucose were used as controls. afs were extracted from each sample, and the afb <dig> contents were quantified using high pressure liquid chromatography . as shown in figure 2a, the afb <dig> content was reduced significantly in samples with  <dig>  to 40 mg/ml d-glucal. an almost complete inhibition was observed when 40 mg/ml d-glucal was used. in contrast, gms media supplied with  <dig> , <dig> or 10 mg/ml d-glucose promoted afb <dig> production . in samples supplied with d-galactal only a slight inhibition on afb <dig> production was detected at the concentration of 40 mg/ml . using thin layer chromatography  analyses, we showed further that production of other afs such as afb <dig> and afg <dig> were also inhibited by d-glucal .

we next examined if d-glucal or d-galactal inhibited mycelial growth, and found that neither d-glucal nor d-galactal affected mycelial growth at the concentration of 40 mg/ml . in contrast, additional d-glucose enhanced mycelial growth significantly, especially from the 3rd day onwards . we next performed experiments on solid gms media with 40 mg/ml d-glucal or d-galactal to assess if these sugar analogs have any effect on sporulation, and observed that exogenous d-glucal inhibited sporulation significantly, while additional d-glucose enhanced sporulation . no effect was observed for d-galactal.

d-glucal promoted kojic acid biosynthesis, but inhibited fatty acid biosynthesis and glucose consumption
we performed metabolomics analyses of mycelia of a. flavus a  <dig>  grown in media with or without 40 mg/ml d-glucal. the gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry  based metabolomics technology developed in our lab has been shown to be a powerful tool to elucidate metabolic changes in a. flavus <cit> . for statistical analyses, we used nine replicates for each treatment. partial least-squares  analyses of metabolite peak areas showed clustering of two distinct groups for mycelia grown in media with or without d-glucal, suggesting that exogenous d-glucal imposed significant metabolic changes in mycelia . in particular, in the presence of d-glucal, the content of glucose, ribitol, glycerol and galactose were increased significantly, while the content of tca intermediates  and fatty acids  including palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid and linoleic acid were decreased . we also noticed that, in the presence of d-glucal, the content of two secondary metabolites, kojic acid and furanacetic acid, were increased by  <dig> and  <dig> fold, respectively. these results together suggest that d-glucal interferes with both primary and secondary metabolism.

we next cultured a. flavus a  <dig>  in gms media with or without 40 mg/ml d-glucal, and measured kojic acid contents in media using a colorimetric method  <cit> . during the 5-d culture period the kojic acid contents in media with d-glucal were always higher  than the control . we also measured glucose content in the media and observed that, in the presence of d-glucal, the glucose content on the 4th and the 5th d were about 30% higher than those in the control media lacking d-glucal, suggesting that exogenous d-glucal inhibited the consumption of glucose .

d-glucal inhibited nor production
we used the a. flavus strain papa  <dig> to decipher at which step d-glucal inhibits af biosynthesis. the lack of functional nor reductase in this strain results in the accumulation of the first stable compound, nor, in the af biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . nor is pinkish in color. after 4-d cultures, the control plate was pink in color, while no color was observed in the plate with 40 mg/ml d-glucal. spectrophotometric analyses showed that nor productions were significantly inhibited by d-glucal at concentrations of 10 mg/ml or higher . these results suggest that d-glucal inhibits the af biosynthesis pathway prior to the production of nor.

d-glucal inhibited expression of af biosynthetic genes, but promoted expression of kojic acid biosynthetic genes
to examine the effect of d-glucal on af biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, we analyzed expression of several genes in the af biosynthetic gene cluster in a. flavus a  <dig>  by qrt-pcr and observed that, in the presence of 40 mg/ml d-glucal, no significant change was detected for aflr , while a 28% reduction was observed for afls . in addition, expression levels of all seven genes encoding af biosynthetic enzymes tested, aflc , afld , aflm , aflo , aflp , aflu  and nada , were decreased significantly . among these, aflc encodes an upstream enzyme in af biosynthesis pathway, acting before nor production to synthesize the polyketide backbone  <cit> , while nada encodes the most downstream enzyme, converting afb <dig> to afg <dig>  <cit> .

we then examined if the expression levels of genes in the sugar utilization gene cluster were changed when cultured in media containing d-glucal. of three genes tested, sugr , hxta , and glca , none showed significant changes in expression . we also analyzed the expression of genes involved in kojic acid biosynthesis: kojr , koja  and kojt   <cit> , and observed that expression levels of all these  <dig> genes were increased when cultured in media with 40 mg/ml d-glucal .

discussion
sugars such as glucose and sucrose are preferred carbohydrates for growth and af production  <cit> . glucose is utilized through glycolysis and tca cycling to provide energy and substrates for downstream metabolic pathways including the af biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . glucose may also act as a signal molecule in sugar sensing to fine-tune the growth and metabolic activities based on the availability of glucose  <cit> . genomic sequencing of a. flavus revealed  <dig> putative secondary metabolism gene clusters that are differentially regulated through global transcriptional regulators such as laea and vea  <cit> . individual secondary metabolic pathways may further be regulated independently by transcriptional regulators located in individual gene clusters for example, aflr and afls in af biosynthesis and kojr in kojic acid biosynthesis  <cit> .

non-metabolizable chemical analogs have been used in the past to inhibit metabolic pathways and to study metabolism  <cit> . in this study, we examined d-galactal and d-glucal, non-metabolizable chemical analogs of d-glucose and galactose, respectively, for their effects on af biosynthesis in a. flavus. we observed that 40 mg/ml d-galactal as a galactose analog did not have much effect on af production. this is not surprising as though galactose supports mycelial growth, it cannot be utilized efficiently for af biosynthesis  <cit> , suggesting galactose utilization might be independent from the af biosynthesis pathway. in contrast, 40 mg/ml d-glucal effectively inhibited af biosynthesis. in the presence of d-glucal, glucose consumption and fa biosynthesis were reduced; the concentrations of tca cycle intermediates were also reduced. in contrast, the production of kojic acid, a secondary metabolite produced directly from glucose, and furanacetic acid, a secondary metabolite of unknown function, were increased. at the metabolic level, we observed that d-glucal inhibited af biosynthesis before production of the first stable intermediate, nor. based on these observations, we propose that, as depicted in route ① of figure  <dig>  d-glucal may interfere directly with enzymes such as hexokinase in glycolysis to prevent sufficient acetyl-coa to be produced for tca cycling, and for af and fa biosynthesis in a. flavus. consequently this has led to the increased glucose level observed in media and possibly in mycelia as well, which may enhance kojic acid biosynthesis. this hypothesis is in agreement with some previous observations that showed that active af production usually correlates with increased accumulation of tca cycle intermediates and active fa biosynthesis  <cit> .

alternatively, since kojic acid is synthesized from glucose without going through glycolysis  <cit> , exogenous d-glucal may interfere with the sugar sensing machinery to enhance kojic acid production directly. the accumulation of kojic acid may have then relieved the oxidative stress in the fungus, which consequently inhibits af biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, as depicted in route ② of figure  <dig>  it is known that kojic acid is a potent antioxidant that is able to scavenge reactive oxygen species  <cit> , and oxidative stress is a prerequisite for af production  <cit> . as reported previously, antioxidants such as eugenol, saffron and caffeic acid are able to inhibit af biosynthesis  <cit> . a negative correlation between kojic acid and af production has been shown before. d-xylose, ethanol, dioctatin a and high temperature are factors known to promote kojic acid production, but inhibit af biosynthesis  <cit> .

we also showed that, although neither d-glucal nor d-galactal supported mycelial growth when used as the sole carbohydrate source, d-glucal inhibited sporulation without affecting mycelial growth. secondary metabolism is usually associated with sporulation in fungi  <cit> , a g-protein signaling pathway is involved in coupling these two processes  <cit> . the coupling does not seem to be very tight, as molasses promotes sporulation but suppresses af production in aspergillus flavus <cit> . it will be interesting to study if d-glucal acts independently in af production and sporulation, or if a common signaling pathway is involved in both processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we showed in this study that d-glucal effectively inhibited af biosynthesis and promoted kojic acid biosynthesis through modulating expression of genes in these two secondary metabolic pathways. the inhibition may occur either directly through interfering with glycolysis, or indirectly through reduced oxidative stresses from kojic acid biosynthesis.
