BACKGROUND
the prevalence of osteoarthritis  in the canine population  dogs in north america
 <cit> ) makes the disease a major cause of concern. the distortion between clinical and radiographic finding in dog oa is well recognized
 <cit> . the symptomatic signs of oa are highly variable, related to pain and physical functioning, and translated into limb impairment, activities limitations and restricted participation
 <cit> . this situation led to the use of multiple methods to assess the efficacy of oa treatment
 <cit> . however, interpretations are not always clear, the results are often inconsistent and clinical validation of these methods is often missing.

the conceptual validitya of the canine pain scales designed for oa and chronic pain has evolved over time
 <cit> . these scales have demonstrated their sensitivity to detect response to oa treatment where pain was reduced following nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
 <cit> , nutraceutical
 <cit>  or other nontraditional
 <cit>  treatment for oa. however, divergent interpretations were addressed when comparing subjective pain scores to an objective evaluation of lameness
 <cit> , emphasizing the limited information on the relationship between pain scales and oa severity. the majority of standardized multifactorial pain questionnaires  are guided by the traditional notion of an inevitably progressive and degenerative disease process; greater behavioral changes indicate higher oa severity and pain in dogs. however, oa is a heterogeneous group of painful conditions
 <cit> . the variety of oa signs suggests the need for the implementation of a clinical assessment that includes a broader variable profile than the current standardized oa profile. for this purpose, the client-specific outcome measures  require the owner to report pain behavioral changes and/or impaired activities in their oa-afflicted dogs
 <cit> . however, the promising csom have not met the technical validityb criteria
 <cit> . these data suggest that psychometricc support for the csom instrument is required.

the enhancement of a measurement’s interpretability requires the referencing of its value to another measurement with established conceptual validity and interpretability. a surrogate to pain evaluation, vertical ground reaction forces, such as pvf and vertical impulse, measured through objective kinetic analysis have prevailed over pain measurements to quantify limb impairment
 <cit> . interestingly, the pvf variable showed sensitivityd and responsivenesse for the efficacy of the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and structural effects of nsaid
 <cit>  and nontraditional
 <cit>  treatments, which supports a regulatory claim for these treatments for osteoarthritic dogs.

physical activity represents a distinct dimension of physical functioning
 <cit> , and as such, telemetered motor activity  is an objective behavioral method for the clinical assessment of physical function and overall well-being for canine oa
 <cit> . however, more data are required to confirm its validity for pain evaluation in oa clinical trials.

clinicians must be able to interpret the literature to implement the best evidence-based practices. therefore, here we performed a preliminary analysis to determine the reliabilityf, responsiveness and criterion validitiesg for canine pain assessment in a one-way crossover clinical trial in naturally occurring oa in dogs that were fed with two successive diets  during a 90-day period. we further hypothesized, first, that changes in measurements of the clinical endpoints  would arise from the diets  with every other possible factor controlled and, second, that validated outcomes would correlate strongly to pvf as the primary outcome and ma as an exploratory outcome. this study determined the clinical utility of selected methods regardless of some technical validities.

RESULTS
animals
a total of  <dig> dogs were initially recruited. seven dogs were excluded for the following reasons: three due to a sudden deterioration of their condition , three for a lack of owner follow-up, and one for nsaid use . the sample included  <dig> males and  <dig> females, and the most frequent breeds were labrador  and golden retrievers . the remainder of the dogs were mixed-breeds  and various pure-breeds . the dogs were  <dig>  to  <dig>  years old  at the time of inclusion and weighed  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg . the joint that caused the most lameness in each animal during the orthopedic examination was the hip  followed by the stifle , shoulder and elbow , and carpus and tarsus . joint pathologies included hip dysplasia , cranial cruciate ligament rupture , elbow dysplasia , shoulder osteochondritis dissecans  , tarsus ocd, and carpus oa with no obvious origin .

primary endpoints
kinetic force platform gait analysis 
the mean cv for pvfbw was not different over time  . a significant effect of the anatomical location of the most affected limb on the pvfbw was observed . moreover, the pvfbw was significantly higher on d <dig> than on d <dig>  and d <dig>  . no differences between d <dig> and d <dig> were observed .

acoefficient of variation  is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. bpvfbw: peak vertical ground reaction force adjusted for body weight change; csom: client-specific outcome measures; eda: electrodermal activity.

descriptive data are represented as mean .cthe mean cv were considered not variable at each time point, when time did not exert a significant effect with p-value higher than  <dig> .

client-specific outcome measures 
the mean cv for csom was not different over time  . the csommed was higher on d <dig> than on d <dig>  and on d <dig>  in the dogs with oa . no difference between d <dig> and d <dig> was noted . the ranked activities  revealed that the second ranked activity ) was significantly different between d <dig> and d <dig>  and d <dig> . no differences over time were observed for the other ranked activities, which suggested that the ranking of the activities had no/poor influence.

selected activities, act to act ranked by decrescendo order of importance by owner. selected behavioural categories, ctg: reduced mobility; ctg: reduced mobility after exercise; ctg: reduced ability to change posture; ctg: reduced ability to change posture after rest or in the morning; ctg: resistance to manipulations. lcl: lower control limit; ucl: upper control limit.

multinomial logistic regression for repeated measures: *significant odds ratio . cochran-mantel-haenszel  test: ♦significant row mean scores difference . estimates were significant p-value  lower than  <dig>  with bonferroni’s adjustment.

the selected activities were categorized as follows:  <dig> activities were ctg ,  <dig> activities were ctg ,  <dig> activities were ctg ,  <dig> activities were ctg ,  <dig> activities were ctg , and one activity was ctg . the ctg was higher on d <dig> than on d <dig> , but no difference was found between the other time points . the ctg was higher on d <dig> than on d <dig>  and on d <dig>  . the ctg revealed a significantly higher score on d <dig> than on d <dig>  . no differences over time were observed for ctg and ctg .

electrodermal activity 
the mean cv for eda was different over time  , which suggested eda was variable on repeated measurement throughout the study. this poor technical reliability precludes any interest in the use of the measurement for the assessment of treatment responsiveness. the eda was not different on d <dig> compared with d <dig>  and d <dig> . no difference was observed between d <dig> and d <dig>  .

criterion validities
the pairwise correlation coefficients between the pvfbw and the csommed were low  = − <dig> ,  <dig>  and − <dig>  on d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  respectively) . some relationship between the pvfbw and the csommed appeared between d <dig> and d <dig> using the descriptive pairwise correlation coefficient  . the regression estimate between the pvfbw and the csommed was significant  = − <dig>  , p =  <dig> ). these results indicate that both variables are convergent and that the csommed change is predictive, in some part, of the pvfbw change. the csom categories were presented as exploratory endpoints because they were a posteriori measures with interesting information . descriptive correlations revealed that the csom categories reflected the csommed.

acsom: client-specific outcome measures; eda: electrodermal activity; ma: motor activity; ctg: reduced mobility; ctg: reduced mobility after exercise; ctg: reduced ability to change posture; ctg: reduced ability to change posture after rest or in the morning.

descriptive data are represented as spearman's rank correlation coefficient at day <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  difference between d <dig> and d <dig> , and difference between d <dig> and d <dig> . 95% ci: 95% confidence interval from bootstrap method of sample of n dogs . na: not available.

the pairwise correlation coefficient between the pvfbw and the eda indicated no linear relationship on d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> or differences between d <dig> and d <dig> and d <dig> and d <dig> . regression analyses demonstrated no relationship between the pvfbw and the eda  =  <dig>  , p =  <dig> ), which implies that eda had no empirical association with pvfbw.

exploratory endpoints
motor activity 
the mixed model of ma recordings in the seven randomized dogs revealed a significant main effect for time , age  and daily period . a significant effect of age was observed between dogs older than 6 years and younger dogs   . a significant effect of the daily period on ma intensity was noted because the dogs were less active at night than during the morning  or the afternoon . the planned comparisons showed that ma intensity was lower at p <dig> compared to p <dig>  .

there was no pairwise correlation  and no relationship between the ma intensity and the pvfbw . no relationship between the ma intensity and the csommed  was noted on the regression analysis. however, there was a significant negative relationship between the ma duration and the csommed .

multifactorial pain questionnaire 
the internal consistency of the mfq-s  and the mfq-d  were lower than expected, which suggested that the selected items were not related to the same constructj.

 <dig> illustrates that the mfq-nrs score was  <dig>  times  higher on d <dig> than on d <dig> , which indicates deterioration in the dogs’ condition. however, this score was unchanged from d <dig> to d <dig>  and from d <dig> to d <dig> . moreover, the mfq-s was lower on d <dig>  compared to on d <dig>  no differences on d <dig> compared with d <dig>  or d <dig>  were noted for mfq-s. finally, the mfq-d and the mfq-rtx did not change over time  . the divergent scoring of the mfq subscales did not validate this standardized scale in the study.

discussion
the present study represents the continued interest in the conceptual and technical validities of multiple methods for pain assessment in canine oa. the pvf, csom, and ma demonstrated convergent results for the detection of diet-induced changes. the pvf exhibited the best technical validity, and the csom and ma demonstrated moderate technical validity. however, the csom evaluating the dogs’ day-to-day health status was found as related to the pvf and was primarily influenced by ma duration. the differences in the conceptual and technical validities suggested pvf, csom, and ma did not provide the same information on oa pain and physical function, but importantly they should be used and interpreted as a whole.

this study demonstrated that the pvf showed responsiveness to a glm-enriched diet effect on canine oa. the study confirmed that the kinetic force platform gait analysis is a useful outcome because of the relative ease of data acquisition and technical validity
 <cit> . interestingly, age, sex and radiographically estimated oa severity were not affecting pvf, and the value of pvf representing the most affected limb was an accurate outcome measure for oa. but it might only partially represent the consequences of the entire disease on the physical function in these selected dogs, with regards to the absence of relationship between pvf and ma.

clinical owner-oriented outcomes would be conceptually preferred, in general, because they are expected to reflect a dog’s quality of life. the questioning of the patient/owner about the quality of life has opened a wider panel of oa physical function and pain assessments. the csom is a subjective instrument that satisfied some psychometric qualities in this clinical trial. the owner-described behaviors in the csom were similar to previously described behaviors in canine studies of oa symptoms and pain
 <cit> . these similarities suggest the face validityk of the csom, which indicates that this measurement assesses the appropriate outcome
 <cit> . reliability testing revealed that the owner’s assessment was not variable over a one-week period. this is suggestive that csom scores were stable at the condition the dog’s status did not change between these two successive csom assessments . with the conditions of the study, it was not possible to judge on a memory effect  and the potential effect of a random error in csom owner assessment. moreover, regression analyses demonstrated that both csom and pvf methods were related, supporting our second hypothesis. but, csom measurements were not strictly parallel to pvf  as only the pvf detected a strict beneficial effect of the glm diet. divergent results between csom and pvf for the responsiveness analysis and the criterion validity analysis might be explained by the technical features of the csom. indeed, the quantification scale of the csom is limited, likely decreasing its responsiveness. in addition, it was difficult to demonstrate a further decrease in the csom beyond d <dig> suggesting a possible floor effect. the sample size of  <dig> dogs was based on the power of the trial to detect a specified clinical benefit on the pvf. according to previous work done in similar conditions
 <cit> , a sample size of  <dig> dogs ensured a difference of  <dig> %bw in the pvf consistent with an effect size of  <dig>  could be detected assuming 80% power, a sd of  <dig>  and a 5% significance threshold. this sample size might be too weak to fully support glm diet efficacy using csom. this result suggests that the csom would decrease the likelihood of false clinical benefits. in contrast, pvf was responsive to glm effect. whereas pvf demonstrated significant change between d <dig> and d <dig>  the primary endpoint csom has not demonstrated a statistically significant change for the same interval time. this could look as controversial for the validity of the methods. therefore, we applied a correction for multiplicity of endpoints that adjusted the type i error when a significant result was required for more than one but not all multiple primary outcomes after correction of multiplicity
 <cit> . with the correction for multiplicity, pvf was significantly different between d <dig> and d <dig>  this method provided stronger evidence to fully characterize the metrological feature of the methods when a small treatment effect is anticipated. in addition, the study suggests the two methods complementary relationship in pain assessment in which the csom assessed pain-induced changes in behavior and locomotion, and the pvf analyzed kinetic gait changes.

previous studies have not indicated the details of the construction of the csom
 <cit> . as previously noted, owners easily report on their dog’s activities, but the number  and the nature of the selected activities in the csom differed between users
 <cit> . this result suggests that oa has a variable impact on the daily life of dogs or that some owners missed behavioral changes that are caused by chronic pain
 <cit> . in this study, an analysis of the influence of each activity revealed that the ranking of activity was neither valid nor informative. however, the categorization of the activities demonstrated significant behavioral changes. the owners detected higher limitations in activity in their dogs after exercise ) or after a certain period of inactivity, including stiffness at night/after activity/in the morning ). these behaviors are events that concur with suggestions of pain signs in previous studies. hence, the selection of the same number of activities  that are worded by the owner but selected from the present categories would allow more precise and sensitive comparisons between dogs in future studies.

our findings reported a significant difference in ma from p <dig> to p <dig> . however, the graph clearly suggests the possibility to detect more frequent differences while taking account individual variability of these data  and required sample size to avoid type ii error. in addition, according to the small sample inference of the linear mixed model
 <cit> , our result needs to be verified on larger sample size. despite limitation about the statistical inference, the present result about ma opens new insight in the field of pain evaluation for osteoarthritic dogs. interestingly, ma did not significantly rely on pvf but to csom. these results emphasized that ma provided an aspect of spontaneous physical activity that was not detected by the conditioned gait evaluation, i.e. pvf. in addition, ma may be influenced by the proper ability of the dog to move freely and reflect its quality of life as defined by csom. therefore, ma and csom are attractive outcome measures of pain and physical function in oa dogs because they are interrelated but different; one measurement is objective and the other is subjective.

the observed divergence in the results of the constitutive mfq subscales , the lack of responsiveness  and the weak internal consistency  lead to poor technical validity and question the construct validityl of this method. although the csom and the mfq were designed for clinical use to evaluate similar aspects of oa, the current results suggest that both pain scales partially reflect the same construct or that the mfq did not satisfy adequate psychometric features. the standardized mfq scale looked less potent to reflect the variability in limb impairment, activity limitations and other pain syndromes in canine oa.

the eda measurement did not provide conclusive results in this clinical study. invalidated outcome measures were observed in experimental conditions in rodents with a higher sympathetic tonus
 <cit> , but our own group has reported positive results with its use in the experimental  canine oa model
 <cit> .

the glm-enriched diet and the glm extracts although not a reference treatment for oa were shown to exert a positive therapeutic effect on the clinical signs of dog oa
 <cit> . although a placebo-controlled trial would have been favored, ethical issues precluded a parallel comparison over 60 days between glm- and placebo-treated dogs. therefore, only a longitudinal one-way crossover design was included in the experimental design using the dogs as their own control. the anticipated effect of the glm-diet was weak
 <cit> . we did not know how much difference should be seen after two months of giving glm. in addition, we observed slight improvement from d <dig> to d <dig> for csom, and ma seemed to be better during p <dig>  two weeks after changing the home food for the control diet. previous studies reported better owner-assessed pain in oa dogs with diet change
 <cit> . altogether, it is possible that the changes were not resulting from the glm-diet but might be representing a trend over time caused by the diet changes
 <cit> . some might argue that pvf was not a good indicator of pain . as other critic in the present study, we could mention the fact that the other methods, i.e. mfq and eda, did not detect any treatment effect over the glm-diet period. however, the sensitivity of mfq and eda was not previously investigated in other oa related-pain study in clinical condition, whereas the vertical ground reaction forces, such as pvf, have already proven their ability to detect change with nsaids treatment
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigated outcome measures that assessed signs in naturally occurring oa in dogs. the data from this study demonstrated that the limitation in activities  and physical function, including limb impairment  and physical activity , acted as complementary measures. further developments on csom and ma would optimize their use in clinical trials.
