BACKGROUND
the majority of the extracellular proteins involved in regulating embryonic development interact with heparin/heparan sulfate , and, moreover, require hs for their cellular activities  <cit> . these include proteins required for lung morphogenesis  <cit> . for example, not only are fibroblast growth factors  essential for lung development  <cit> , but they require hs for fgf receptor activation and subsequent signalling  <cit> . due to its vast interactome and location at the cell surface and within the extracellular matrix , hs is ideally positioned to integrate biochemical regulators of lung development with mechanical stimuli required for normal lung growth  <cit> .

hs is a linear polysaccharide consisting of n-acetyl glucosamine-glucuronic acid disaccharide repeats. chains are variably modified by n-deacetylation/n-sulfation of n-acetyl glucosamines, o-sulfation at various positions and conversion of glucuronic acid to its c- <dig> epimer, iduronic acid. these modifications do not occur at every potential site within a chain, resulting in a diverse range of hs chain structures displayed by a cell  <cit> . moreover, hs is post-synthetically remodelled by 6-o-endosulfatase enzymes, which selectively remove sulphate groups  <cit> . hs chains are usually attached to core proteins to form hs proteoglycans , which are expressed by most mammalian cells and represent a major component of the cell surface and ecm. individual cells of a tissue display a variety of hs chains, which, in addition to being structurally complex and diverse, are dynamic, altering over time and with cellular physiology  <cit> . since interactions between hs and proteins are mediated by specific hs structures, changes in hs structure in vivo are likely to alter hs:protein binding events and related signalling. characterising hs fine structure in vivo is, therefore, important as it equates to a view of hs function.

obtaining structural information on native hs is challenging due to the non-template nature of hs biosynthesis . tissue hs is typically analysed by extraction and purification. however, the inherent averaging of this approach limits the information to an overall assessment of the mixed population of hs structures present, and all spatial information is lost. in addition, due to the relative low immunogenicity of hs, only a limited number of hs specific monoclonal antibodies are available  <cit> . however, single chain variable fragment  antibodies generated by bacteriophage  display methodology  <cit>  allow specific classes of structures in hs to be probed in situ. we have demonstrated recently that these antibodies display distinct specificities for different hs structures in vitro and, therefore, the individual hs epitopes they recognise, though structurally complex, are unique  <cit> . limited analysis of one antibody shows that these probes are suitable to identify the diversity of hs in different cellular compartments of fetal lungs  <cit> .

hs plays a fundamental role in airway morphogenesis. in drosophila and mice, disrupted hs biosynthesis in vivo results in defective airway branching, which in the mouse, results in lethal neonatal respiratory insufficiency  <cit> . in addition, digestion of endogenous hs in cultured lung explants using heparitinases or inhibition of hs sulfation with sodium chlorate, disrupts branching  <cit> . further compelling evidence for a critical role of hs in lung disease is the association in humans and mice of mutations in the hspg, glypican- <dig>  with lung hypoplasia and congenital diaphragmatic hernia , known as simpson-golabi-behmel syndrome  <cit> . it is, therefore, clear that hs is crucial for lung development and identifies hs as a potential contributor to pulmonary pathologies such as pulmonary hypoplasia in cdh  <cit> .

cdh is characterised by a diaphragmatic defect, herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity and pulmonary hypoplasia. the high neonatal morbidity and mortality is largely attributed to severe respiratory insufficiency resulting from hypoplastic lung growth and pulmonary hypertension. hitherto, most work exploring the pathogenesis of human birth defects has focussed on the identification of changes in gene expression and/or in protein levels. however, very few truly genetic causes of these defects have been identified. since strong evidence supports a central role for hs as a master regulator of extracellular proteins controlling embryogenesis, we have investigated hs structure during development of the lung, and in the pathogenesis of cdh and pulmonary hypoplasia using hs specific 'phage display antibodies. we utilised the teratogen-induced rodent model of cdh, which uses nitrofen  to induce congenital malformations in the offspring of treated pregnant dams with striking similarity to human cdh  <cit> . here, we demonstrate that hs undergoes structural alterations during normal lung development and that there are pronounced abnormalities of hs structure and epitope distribution in hypoplastic lungs. aberrations in epithelial basement membrane structure and composition were also identified in hypoplastic lungs, reflecting a specific abnormality in the ecm. the functional importance of these changes to hs structure during normal development and in hypoplastic lung is illustrated by our finding that a number of the hs epitopes are analogous to structures recognised by the critical morphogenetic growth factors, fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  hence, these novel glycobiological defects may contribute to defective lung morphogenesis via altered interactions between hs and key signalling molecules such as fgfs. in addition, altered contacts between the ecm and cell surface are likely to interrupt mechanotransduction across a tissue, which is crucial for morphogenesis. hs may, therefore, play significant biochemical and biomechanical roles in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypoplasia in cdh.

hs structure changes during normal rat lung development
different staining patterns were observed in developing rat lung with the various hs antibodies, indicating recognition of distinct hs epitope structures .

levels of immunostaining in the various lung compartments were scored blind by two independent observers with images that were representative of three separate lung samples, as follows: -

- no staining, +/- very low staining, + low staining, ++ moderate staining, +++ high staining

one particular hs epitope recognised by hs4c3v was not identified in developing rat lungs of any age. the use of adult rat kidney as a positive control demonstrates that this structure is indeed absent from lung . the remaining six antibodies show distinct patterns of staining in fetal rat lungs, and the various lung compartments display different hs structures . for example, in airway epithelium, hs structures recognised by ev3c3v, ao4b08v and hs3a8v are displayed, whereas the other three antibody epitopes are not. at e <dig> , only the ev3c3v hs epitope is displayed by the epithelium, and at e <dig> , the ao4b08v and hs3a8v hs epitopes are also present . the spatial localisation of these hs epitopes was shown to change during lung morphogenesis, indicating alterations in the structure of native hs chains during mammalian lung development . for example, the hs epitope recognised by hs3a8v is displayed exclusively by epithelial basement membranes at e <dig>  at a high level. at the early pseudoglandular period , this structure is additionally displayed at a high level throughout the mesenchyme and by the airway epithelium. at the late pseudoglandular period , mesenchymal expression of this epitope remains high; however, distribution of the structure becomes particularly concentrated around smaller developing airways and epithelial staining is no longer present. at canalicular  and saccular  fetal stages, hs3a8v epitope levels in the mesenchyme decrease and epitope distribution becomes more widespread . in contrast, the hs epitope identified by ew4g1v is not present in e <dig>  rat lungs; however, at e <dig>  it is detected in epithelial basement membranes and in the surrounding mesenchyme at a low level . at e <dig> , levels of this hs epitope drastically increase, particularly in epithelial basement membranes, while epitope levels in the mesenchyme remain low and its distribution becomes concentrated around smaller distal airways. from e <dig>  - e <dig> , distribution of the ew4g1v epitope becomes more widespread throughout the mesenchyme .

in the pulmonary vasculature, hs3b7v shows a unique staining profile, specifically highlighting regions in the outer tunica media of arterial walls . this hs structure is absent from the inner medial layer, in contrast to the other five antibody epitopes, which were present and showed comparable vascular staining, highlighting the medial layer of both arteries and veins, predominantly the basal lamina surrounding smooth muscle cell layers .

hs structure is abnormal in hypoplastic lungs from nitrofen-induced cdh
identification of hspgs with the 3g <dig> antibody, which recognises the neo-epitope generated on all hspgs following heparitinase digestion of the hs chains, indicated that there is no gross disruption in the overall spatial localisation of hspgs in hypoplastic lungs. however, levels of hspgs are reduced, particularly at e <dig>  - e <dig>  and in epithelial basement membranes . analysis of specific hs epitopes with 'phage display antibodies indicated an abnormality in the fine structure of hs in hypoplastic lungs, which was also more marked in lungs of earlier gestation . levels of a number of hs epitopes are reduced  or lost  from the airway epithelium at e <dig>  and e <dig>  compared to normal lungs . moreover, all of the hs structures analysed are displayed at a lower level by epithelial basement membranes. although a number of hs structures are also shown to be reduced in hypoplastic lung mesenchyme  , hs structural alterations are more complex than a simple reduction or loss of epitopes. levels of the hs epitope identified by ev3c3v are increased in hypoplastic lung mesenchyme, and in addition, the spatial distribution of this hs structure is abnormal . in e <dig>  - e <dig>  control lung mesenchyme, a gradient of ev3c3v epitope distribution is observed, with sub-epithelial areas adjacent to smaller, distal airways displaying high epitope levels and more proximal regions of the lung displaying a lower level of the structure. however, in nitrofen treated hypoplastic lungs, this gradient is not present and epitope distribution is more widespread throughout the entire lung mesenchyme . at e <dig>  - e <dig> , ev3c3v epitope levels and distribution are comparable to that observed in control lungs.

pulmonary arteries of nitrofen-treated hypoplastic lungs have thickened vessel walls with increased smooth muscle content, contributing to the persistent pulmonary hypertension associated with cdh  <cit> . although we confirmed marked thickening in arterial walls of nitrofen-treated lungs, no difference in hs or hspg staining was observed. all hs antibodies highlighted the tunica media, with five predominantly staining the basal lamina surrounding the layers of smooth muscle and hs3b7v specifically highlighting an outer region of the arterial walls.

hs/hspg staining identifies abnormalities in epithelial basement membranes
abnormalities in epithelial basement membrane hspg expression and hs structure were identified in hypoplastic lungs. basement membranes appear thinner, and levels of both hspgs  and specific hs epitopes  are reduced. in addition, staining with hs antibodies revealed discontinuities in basement membrane hs distribution, which are not observed with 3g <dig> immunohistochemistry.

to examine the general structure of epithelial basement membranes in hypoplastic lungs and evaluate whether abnormalities are hs/hspg specific, hypoplastic rat lungs were probed with an antibody to laminin , an integral component of basement membranes. immunohistochemical detection of laminin indicated that epithelial basement membranes are indeed thinner; however, no discontinuities in laminin staining were observed . the abnormally fine laminin staining of epithelial basement membranes was more pronounced in lungs at the pseudoglandular stages of development , reminiscent of hs and hspg basement membrane staining.

functional analysis of hs epitopes using elisa
to further our understanding of the functional consequences of abnormal hs structure identified in hypoplastic lungs, we analysed the specificities of the hs antibodies in competition elisas with fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  which are known to be involved in lung morphogenesis  <cit> . the relative binding affinities of fgfs for hs epitopes were evaluated by determining ic <dig> values, defined as the concentration of fgf that inhibits antibody binding to hs by 50% . this allowed us to investigate possible overlap between antibody epitope structures and fgf binding sites in hs, to identify potential biological functions of the antibody epitopes.

fgf <dig> competed for all six antibody epitopes to varying extents , whereas fgf <dig> only competed for two antibody epitopes, recognised by hs3b7v and hs3a8v . the ability of fgf <dig> to compete for hs3b7v, hs4e4v and hs3a8v epitopes was similar, with ic <dig> values of  <dig> nm ±  <dig>  nm,  <dig> nm ±  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm ±  <dig>  nm. fgf <dig> also showed comparable competition for ao4b08v and ew4g1v epitopes, with ic <dig> values of  <dig> nm ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> nm ±  <dig>  nm. significant competition for the ev3c3v epitope structure in hs was achieved with fgf <dig>  with an ic <dig> value of  <dig>  nm ±  <dig> nm. in contrast to fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> only competed with two antibodies, hs3b7v and hs3a8v, for hs binding, with ic <dig> values of  <dig> nm ±  <dig> nm and  <dig>  μm ±  <dig>  μm, respectively .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
hs is a master regulator of morphogenesis and is essential for lung development. in the present study, we have demonstrated spatiotemporal alterations in hs structure and distribution during normal and hypoplastic lung development using hs specific 'phage display antibodies. moreover, we show that a number of antibody epitopes are also structures recognised by fgfs, suggesting that abnormal distribution of these epitopes in hypoplastic cdh lungs may alter fgf binding, with functional consequences for morphogenesis.

hs structure in normal fetal rat lungs
a number of hs scfv antibodies have been used previously to analyse hs structures in adult human lungs  <cit> . only one of these antibodies used in the previous work is used in the present study . in adult lungs, the ev3c3v hs epitope is identified in airway epithelial cells and their underlying basement membranes and in basement membranes surrounding smooth muscle cells of blood vessels  <cit> . we also identified the ev3c3v epitope in epithelial and smooth muscle cell basement membranes at all developmental stages  and in airway epithelial cells at e <dig>  - e <dig>  . this demonstrates a degree of conservation in hs structure between species.

we demonstrate that distinct cellular compartments of the lung display a variety of hs chains of different structure, which are modified during lung development, with temporal variation in both expression level and spatial localisation of hs epitopes identified by hs antibodies.

the epitope for one antibody, hs4c3v, was not identified in fetal lungs, however, it was present in kidney tissue  and has previously been detected in immunoblots of solubilised fetal lung extracts  <cit> . this raises the possibility of cryptic binding sites for the antibodies in situ, and is an important consideration when interpreting immunohistochemical data, i.e., the absence of an epitope in situ does not necessarily mean it is not present in a tissue, rather, the epitope may be masked, for example, by endogenous proteins bound to hs. the antibodies, therefore, specifically highlight free binding structures in hs. indeed, occupied, cryptic binding sites in hs in situ have been identified previously in growing mammary glands probed with fgf <dig>  <cit> .

the antibody binding specificities  suggests the nature of the observed changes in hs structure that occur in developing lungs. for example, the hs4e4v hs epitope is not found in e <dig>  lungs, and at e <dig>  - e <dig> , the epitope is identified in the mesenchyme surrounding distal, but not proximal airways . this can be explained by contrasting patterns of sulfation, e.g., highly sulfated hs modified with both 6-o- and 2-o-sulfates are located in the mesenchyme surrounding proximal airways, while less sulfated hs, modified by 6-o- or 2-o- sulfates is found in mesenchyme surrounding distal airways, where it offers optimal binding for hs4e4v  <cit> . in contrast to hs4e4v, hs3a8v binds to more highly sulfated hs, particularly n-sulfated sequences , and displays a wider epitope distribution throughout fetal lung mesenchyme . hence, more highly sulfated hs in proximal mesenchyme may allow binding of hs3a8v, but not hs4e4v, while a more heterogeneous population of hs structures in distal mesenchyme, allows binding of both.

the localisation of specific hs structures within the developing lung and their importance for the coordination of branching morphogenesis has been hinted at in previous studies, e.g., expression of the epitope recognised by the hs specific monoclonal antibody, 10e <dig>  was shown to alter rapidly with lung growth in vitro  <cit> . in addition, blanket addition of heparin to lung cultures lacking endogenous sulfated gags after sodium chlorate treatment results in generalised epithelial expansion, indicating a global growth response, rather than defined branching  <cit> . these data, together with ours, suggest that distinct hs structures are specifically displayed by the various lung cell types to direct localised signalling and spatiotemporally restricted morphogenetic cues, e.g., epithelial budding. in addition, modification of hs fine structure during development, together with alterations in hs microenvironment via dynamic hs:protein interactions, will influence crucial cell-cell and cell-matrix communication governing lung morphogenesis. hs structural dynamics are, therefore, likely to be an important regulator of fetal lung morphogenesis.

hs structure and epitope distribution are abnormal in hypoplastic cdh lungs
using the nitrofen rat model of cdh, we investigated the potential role of hs in hypoplastic lung development, since hs has been shown to be crucial for normal lung morphogenesis. in addition, it has been shown previously that nitrofen-exposed rat lung explants respond abnormally to exogenous fgf <dig> and fgf <dig> and also heparin, suggesting a possible defect in the fgf:fgfr:hs signalling system  <cit> . notably, in humans, a mutation in the gene encoding the hspg, glypican- <dig>  features multiple congenital anomalies, including cdh  <cit> .

following analysis of hs fine structure and its developmental regulation during normal rat lung morphogenesis, hs structure and distribution was analysed in hypoplastic lungs from rats with nitrofen-induced cdh. in hypoplastic lungs, hspg expression is reduced, and in addition, specific abnormalities in hs structure and spatial distribution were observed, which cannot simply be a consequence of an overall reduction in the level of hspgs, since the level of some epitopes is increased, e.g., ev3c3v . as the overall distribution of hspgs appears the same in control and hypoplastic lungs, abnormalities in the spatial distribution of specific epitopes is likely to reflect alterations in hs fine structure and irregular localisation of discrete hs structures displayed by the various lung cell types. in addition, the occupancy or availability of antibody binding sites may differ in hypoplastic lungs due to differences in protein binding events. it is of note that the molecular abnormalities highlighted in hypoplastic lungs are most striking at the pseudoglandular period of respiratory morphogenesis, when the lung is actively branching  . this supports previous work, suggesting that in cdh, lungs are intrinsically abnormal from early stages of organogenesis and that lung defects emerge in tandem alongside the hernia  <cit> .

abnormal hs structure has been shown to result in defective lung development in previous studies, e.g., in mice lacking hs biosynthetic enzymes, ndst- <dig> or c5-epimerase  <cit> . in drosophila, rnai of hs 6-o-sulfotransferase  perturbs fgf signalling and disrupts primary branching of the tracheal system  <cit>  and, similarly, a proportion of mutant drosophila embryos lacking functional hs6st develop tracheal branching defects  <cit> . the generation of double mutants lacking functional 2-o-sulfotransferase  and hs6st is completely lethal, with disrupted fgf signalling and a failure of tracheal precursor cells to migrate to form primary branches  <cit> . in the mammalian lung, chemical inhibition of hs sulfation prevents fgf <dig> induced epithelial budding  <cit>  and hs6st <dig> deficient mice exhibit impaired alveolarisation  <cit> . in contrast to previous studies where hs biosynthesis has been perturbed and effects on the lung sought, the present study investigates an established developmental malformation  to show for the first time that hypoplastic lungs feature substantial abnormalities of hs structure and epitope distribution. moreover, previous studies in which hs has been disrupted, e.g., by deletion of genes encoding hs biosynthetic enzymes, have not characterised in any depth the actual effects on hs structure and epitope distribution in the malformed lung.

changes in hs structure in the lung is likely to modify hs:protein interactions, since these rely on specific hs structures  <cit> . this in turn, will affect various signalling systems, as hs:protein interactions have been shown to be functionally significant, regulating transport and effector functions of the protein ligand. for example, hs plays a key role in fgf signalling, which is fundamental for lung morphogenesis.

hs facilitates interactions between fgfs and fgfrs and is also required for sustained fgfr activation and subsequent cellular signalling  <cit> . cells expressing fgfrs but lacking hspgs are unresponsive to fgf unless heparin/hs is added  <cit>  and treatment of cells with sodium chlorate or heparinase blocks the biological activity of fgfs, an effect which can be restored by the addition of exogenous heparin  <cit> . in an ex vivo model system of epithelial branching morphogenesis using mouse salivary gland, modification of fgf:hs binding affinities was shown to impact upon the morphogenetic effect of fgfs  <cit> . fgf <dig> with a reduced affinity for hs , formed abnormal gradients due to altered transport properties, resulting in an induction of epithelial branching rather than elongation observed with wild type fgf <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, reduced affinity of fgf <dig> for its receptor, fgfr2b, affected only the extent of the response, without altering the nature of the response.

abnormal hs structure and distribution observed here in hypoplastic lungs can, therefore, be expected to contribute to defective lung morphogenesis via aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal signalling as a result of altered hs:protein interactions.

competitive selectivity of fgfs and antibodies provides insight into structure:function relationships of epitopes and a functional consequence of abnormal hs in hypoplastic lungs
competitive binding assays with fgfs and hs antibodies allowed us to demonstrate that antibodies recognise specific hs structures that are also recognised by key fgf morphogens, thereby revealing biological relevance of epitopes. alterations in fgf bindings sites in the lung has previously been shown to have functional consequences for morphogenesis  <cit> .

fgf <dig> is expressed in the developing lung and is important for lung morphogenesis  <cit> . the hs binding specificity of fgf <dig> is well characterised, requiring n-sulfated and 2-o-sulfated hs structures  <cit>  and at least a tetrasaccharide  <cit>  for binding. in competitive binding assays, fgf <dig> competed with all six hs antibodies to varying extents. of particular note is the effectiveness of fgf <dig> to compete with ev3c3v, which was significantly higher compared to competition with the other antibodies . previous characterisation of epitope structures reveals that ev3c3v binding structures are analogous to those recognised by fgf <dig>  both require n-sulfation and 2-o-sulfation for binding, with little sensitivity to the presence or absence of 6-o-sulfates   <cit> . the other epitopes appear to overlap in part with structures recognised by fgf <dig>  requiring a higher concentration of fgf <dig> to successfully compete with the antibodies. these structures may represent lower affinity binding sites for fgf <dig>  which have been previously identified in hs  <cit> .

similarly, fgf <dig> is essential for normal lung development  <cit> . in binding assays, fgf <dig> showed more selective competition than fgf <dig>  competing only for the epitopes recognised by hs3b7v and hs3a8v . although the binding specificity of fgf <dig> is not as well characterised as that of fgf <dig>  the competitive binding data for fgf <dig> illustrates the biological relevance of the observed variation in these epitopes in normal and hypoplastic prenatal lungs. fgf <dig> competes most effectively for hs3b7v epitopes, with an ic <dig> value almost three times lower than with hs3a8v . we have previously shown that hs3b7v requires longer hs structures for significant binding   <cit> , and this may also reflect the binding specificity of fgf <dig>  as fgf <dig> has been shown to readily form homodimers in solution  <cit> , the requirement for longer hs structures for binding may not be that surprising.

functional analysis of epitope structures enables us to suggest potential biological consequences of abnormal epitope distribution in developing lungs. in cdh hypoplastic lungs, the ev3c3v epitope was identified at a higher level compared to normal lungs, and in addition, was shown to be abnormally distributed in hypoplastic lung mesenchyme . this may indicate an increase in the number of ev3c3v epitopes and, therefore, structures recognised by fgf <dig>  in the hs synthesised by the lung cells. alternatively, the availability of these structures may be increased in the lung mesenchyme due to altered expression of proteins that bind this class of structures. moreover, these lungs respond abnormally to fgf <dig>  <cit> . addition of fgf <dig> to nitrofen-treated lung explants results in increased lung area and formation of dilated, cystic airways, whereas fgf <dig> was shown to have minimal effect on the growth of control lung explants  <cit> . our data describing an increased number of available ev3c3v/fgf <dig> binding structures in the mesenchyme of hypoplastic lungs provides a possible explanation for this abnormal response to exogenous fgf <dig> 

epitopes analogous to structures recognised by fgf <dig>  i.e., the hs3a8v and hs3b7v epitopes, were also abnormally expressed in nitrofen-treated lungs. both epitopes were expressed at a reduced level in epithelial basement membranes and in addition, showed abnormal mesenchymal expression . the hs3b7v epitope was displayed at a low level in sub-epithelial mesenchymal compartments of e <dig>  hypoplastic lungs, and this is a compartment which was not stained in normal lungs . the hs3a8v epitope was identified at a high level in sub-epithelial mesenchyme at e <dig>  and e <dig>  in normal lungs, however, in hypoplastic lungs, mesenchymal expression was reduced and the partitioning of hs3a8v staining in sub-epithelial and sub-mesothelial mesenchyme was not evident . thus, these hs structures recognised by fgf <dig> are either synthesised at an abnormal frequency in hs chains, or the availability of these structures in hs chains is reduced in an irregular manner. fgf <dig> has been shown to be particularly important for mesenchymal growth and differentiation  <cit>  and mesenchymal-epithelial signalling through regulation of other morphogen expression levels  <cit> . an abnormal distribution of hs structures able to bind fgf <dig> in the lung mesenchyme may, therefore, have a significant effect on fgf <dig> transport between cellular compartments and/or activity, including downstream effects on other morphogens regulated by fgf <dig>  for example, shh and fgf <dig> and fgf <dig>  <cit> . collectively, these data suggest that observed changes in hs structure in hypoplastic lungs is likely to result in altered interactions with critical regulatory proteins, such as fgfs, leading to irregular cell signalling and epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk, which may ultimately contribute to defective lung morphogenesis.

abnormal hs may help explain disrupted mechanobiology in hypoplastic lungs
the ecm facilitates communication between cellular and extracellular environments, including mechanotransduction  <cit> . prenatal airway smooth muscle  exhibits periodic contractility resulting in rhythmic airway peristalsis, which moves lung liquid along the airways and induces a distending pressure in end buds, stretching the lung to promote growth  <cit> . demonstrating a specific link between hs dependent signalling and airway contractility, fgf <dig> is synthesised by these asm cells  <cit>  and stimulates airway peristalsis  <cit> . however, in hypoplastic lungs from the nitrofen cdh model, reduced fgf <dig> levels  <cit>  accompany abnormal airway peristalsis  <cit> . given the large hs interactome, the structural changes in hs identified here provide a promising possible explanation for the mechanical abnormalities measured in hypoplastic lungs.

epithelial basement membranes are abnormal in hypoplastic lungs
basement membranes are specialised extracellular matrices underlying epithelial and endothelial cells  <cit>  composed mainly of collagen iv, laminin, nidogen/entactin and proteoglycans including hspgs, perlecan  <cit> , agrin  <cit>  and collagen xviii  <cit> . hspgs contribute to basement membrane assembly, structure and function: e.g., when grown in sodium chlorate, murine teratocarcinoma cells develop an incorrectly assembled basement membrane  <cit> . in addition, heparin and hs influence associations between basement membrane components, laminin and collagen iv  <cit> . hspgs also regulate growth factor activity by controlling their transport through the matrix and sequestering them to form local reservoirs  <cit> . in the developing lung, basement membranes are pivotal for epithelial-mesenchymal cross talk and irregular assembly and structure of airway basement membranes is detrimental to lung morphogenesis  <cit> .

we have shown here that hypoplastic lungs exhibit abnormal epithelial basement membranes. immunodetection of laminin, hspgs and hs structures demonstrated an abnormally thinned basement membrane. additionally, hs epitopes, but not hspgs or laminin, were displayed discontinuously in hypoplastic lungs, suggesting abnormal localisation of hs epitopes and/or availability of binding sites in hs.

clinical implications
current treatments for cdh primarily focus on postnatal management to address the consequences of pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension, including strategies aimed at providing adequate tissue oxygenation via inhaled nitric oxide, high frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . however, cdh mortality has not been greatly improved. results from the present work suggest that heparin/hs based therapeutics may be beneficial in ameliorating hypoplastic lung growth in cdh. indeed, a number of glycotherapeutics are emerging for the repair of damaged tissue, e.g., skin and bone  <cit>  and for the treatment of some cancers  <cit> . the morphogenetic effect of chemically modified heparins has previously been investigated in salivary gland branching morphogenesis  <cit> . using a similar rationale, investigating the effect of various engineered heparins on lung growth may help develop a class of hs structures able to ameliorate lung hypoplasia, reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and increase vascular branching. with chemically modified heparins available, which possess low or zero anticoagulant activity  <cit> , this is an exciting potential future therapeutic avenue.
