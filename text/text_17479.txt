BACKGROUND
probiotic lactobacilli have been increasingly implicated in a number of health-promoting functions  <cit> . quite a part of commercial probiotic lactobacilli isolated from intestinal microbiota, such as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. johnsonii, l. paracasei, and l. reuteri have been widely demonstrated to interact with gut physiological processes and confer benefits to host organisms  <cit> . on the other hand, some lactobacillus species, such as l. delbrueckii, l. helveticus, and l. plantarum, are traditionally involved in the production of fermented foods  <cit> . unlike the commensal lactobacilli that colonize the intestinal tract, food originated lactobacillus cells are ingested along with food flow during the consumption of fermented products and, consequently, may directly come in contact both with the host’s gastrointestinal mucosa and intestinal microbiota. the potential influence of food-associated lactobacilli on host’s health compared to that of intestinal lactobacilli, however, has been poorly investigated.

lactobacillus helveticus strains are extensively used in manufacture of swiss-type cheeses and italian cheeses , as well as fermented drinks  <cit> . remarkably, genome sequencing had revealed that l. helveticus dpc <dig> isolated from cheese whey shares the nearest identity  with the gut organism l. acidophilus ncfm, one of probiotic strains thoroughly investigated for probiotic functions  <cit> . giving fermented food originated bacterium had its adaptive evolution in dairy environment, there is strong need to explore its probiotic properties and crosstalk with host immune system as well as intestinal bacteria. some researches had demonstrated the efficacy of l. helveticus in modulating of host physiology. for instance, milk fermented with l. helveticus r <dig> decreases the growth rate of mammary tumors  <cit> . furthermore, the presence of s-layer proteins was proposed to contribute to probiotic properties of l. helveticus strains  <cit> . s-layer protein of l. helveticus mimlh <dig> was recently demonstrated to be involved in immunomodulatory effects  <cit> .

koumiss is a spontaneously fermented mare’s milk drink and has been traditionally popular among nomadic populations of central asia and mongolian areas  <cit> . in 1980s, a batch of studies had reported the therapeutic potentials of koumiss on the alimentary canal’s activity, the circulatory, nervous systems and the immune system  <cit> . however, only a few studies focused on the probiotic strains isolated from koumiss. in this study, a promising isolate ns <dig> was selected from fermented koumiss of mongolian pasturing area, and identified as l. helveticus by genus and species specific pcr as well as 16s rrna sequencing. the selected culture was subjected to characterization for functional and probiotic attributes. to determine the suitability of ns <dig> for exploitation as a probiotic, particularly for application in functional food, we studied the probiotic properties like ph and bile salt tolerance, cell surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation, and anti-inflammatory activities. in addition, we also investigated the presence of s-layer protein and its role in promoting immunomodulatory activity in a lps-induced mouse macrophage cell line raw <dig> . ns <dig> showed prominent results in inducing il- <dig> expression. because il- <dig> plays a central role in downregulating inflammatory cascades, strains capable of inducing this cytokine would likely be good candidates for use in anti-inflammatory intervention. nevertheless, substantial differences were found among probiotic strains in their capacity to induce cytokine profile  <cit> . recently, il-10/il- <dig> cytokine induction ratio on peripheral blood mononuclear cells  has also been used to distinguish the anti-inflammatory properties of probiotics  <cit> . we employed both in vitro cytokine production assay and a murine trinitrobenzene sulfonate  model of acute colitis in vivo. in this paper, we describe the various probiotic and functional properties of l. helveticus ns <dig> and could provide important insights into the health-modulating potential of this strain.

RESULTS
screening and genetic identification of ns8
in total,  <dig> typical colonies of lactic acid bacteria isolates were obtained from fermented koumiss based on morphological characteristics after gram’s staining and catalase negative reaction. by testing the survival abilities in git environment and adherent potential to intestinal mucosa in vitro, only strain ns <dig> was selected as candidate for probiotic, which showed higher tolerance to low ph  and toxic bile salts . then we identified this strain as l. helveticus ns <dig> by performing 16s rrna gene sequencing  and blast search. considering the wide inter-strain variability of l. helveticus and difficult discrimination between l. helveticus and closely related species, such as l. acidophilus and l. delbrueckii, l. helveticus specific primer pairs targeting the sequences of aminopeptidases c and n, and a trypsin-like serine protease gene  were applied in a species specific pcr assay  <cit> . the pcr fragments obtained had sizes of about  <dig>   <dig> and 900 bp respectively , which were in good accordance with the expected sizes.fig.  <dig> molecular identification of l. helveticus ns <dig> isolate. a. pcr typing of ns <dig> isolate by using species-specific pepc/pepn/htra primers  and l. helveticus specific primers for amplification of partial 326 bp slph gene . there is no pcr product obtained by using primers targeted against l. acidophilus slpa . lane  <dig>  dna ladder. b. morphology of ns <dig> under scanning electron microscope. ns <dig> are rod-shaped bacteria with high adhesion capacity to caco- <dig> cells



surface properties of ns8
to investigate the surface properties of ns <dig>  the isolate as well as food-originated probiotic strains l. acidophilus <dig>   <cit>  and l. plantarum th <dig>  <cit>   were subjected to an array of tests. as shown in table  <dig>  the adhesion ratio of ns <dig> isolate with caco- <dig> cell culture was estimated to be  <dig>  %, which was significantly higher than the other probiotic strains with values of  <dig>  % of l. acidophilus  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of l. plantarum th <dig> respectively. strong adhesion of ns <dig> to caco- <dig> cells could also be clearly seen in the sem micrographs of fig. 1b. besides, ns <dig> exhibited the highest cellular autoaggregation  compared with l. acidophilus <dig>   and l. plantarum th <dig> . the autoaggregating phenotype of ns <dig> was so strong that over half bacteria have formed a precipitate in 1 h , while other bacterial suspensions showed constant turbidity with little precipitate. with a similar trend, the hydrophobic values obtained for ns <dig> in the presence of xylene was significantly higher than the other two strains. adhesion to chloroform  and ethyl acetate  was also tested to assess the lewis acid-base characteristics of the bacterial cell surfaces .table  <dig> cell surface properties of l. helveticus ns <dig> and other probiotic cultures

influence of s-layer protein on cell surface properties
two sets of primers targeted against s-layer gene of l. helveticus  and l. acidophilus  respectively were designed, according to the genome sequences of l. helveticus dpc <dig>  and l. acidophilus ncfm . fig. 1a showed the amplification of an expected pcr product of size 300 bp when assayed using slph primers, but no product by using slpa primers.

for extraction the s-layer protein from ns <dig> bacteria, a generally employed method for the removal of s-layer proteins from the cell surfaces, licl extraction, was applied for ns <dig>  sds-page revealed the molecular mass of the protein is approximately 42 kda, basically in line with those characterized s-layer proteins . we verified whether the protocol based on licl washes efficiently removed most of the s-layer proteins from the surface of l. helveticus cells. after s-layer removal, autoaggregation ability of ns <dig> reduced dramatically from  <dig> to 32 % . the bacterial morphology also changed from appearance of cluster into separated cells under microscope . these results indicated that the presence of s-layer protein contributed to the cell surface properties of ns <dig> fig.  <dig> influence of s-layer protein on the cell surface properties of l. helveticus ns <dig>  a. sds-page profile with coomassie blue staining of extracted s-layer protein by licl treatment, indicating an approximate mass value of 42 kda. lane  <dig>  low molecular weight protein standards; lane  <dig>  5 μg of purified protein was loaded on the gel. b. comparison of the autoaggregation ability of ns <dig> before  and after removal of their surface layer proteins . error bars represent standard deviations  of the mean values of results from three replicate experiments. c. bacterial micrographs of ns <dig>  showing the morphology difference between autoaggregated cells  and those cells after removal of s-layer proteins . magnification, × 100



anti-inflammatory attributes
colitis protective ability in vivo
to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of ns <dig>  we compared the development of tnbs-induced colitis in mice that were treated, or not, with ns <dig>  we observed that weight loss was significantly reduced in mice receiving ns <dig>  as compared with mice not received bacteria . characteristic features of colitis were observed 2 days after administration of tnbs in the mice receiving no bacteria, leading to a wallace score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , which corresponds to several areas of ulceration accompanied by intestinal wall thickening. histological analysis performed on these mice revealed large areas of ulceration with inflammatory infiltrates . in contrast, mice that had received ns <dig> bacteria displayed significantly less severe lesions. necrotic lesions were observed in only three mouse of ten, whereas the others suffered mildly from hyperemia and thickening of the intestinal wall, leading to a wallace score of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> anti-inflammatory effect of l. helveticus ns <dig> on acute colitis induced in balb/c mice by intrarectal administration of tnbs. a. weight variation between day  <dig>  and day  <dig> . b. wallace inflammation scores. results are means ± sem of one representative experiment . significant p <  <dig>  , as compared with the tnbs control group. c. histological sections of colonic tissues of balb/c mice. left, blank control group receiving ethanol 50 %; middle, tnbs-treated group receiving no ns8; right, tnbs-treated mice gavaged with ns <dig>  magnification, ×100



cytokine stimulation in human pbmcs
we investigated the cytokine profiles stimulated by ns <dig> upon pbmcs collected from  <dig> independent donors. although the absolute cytokine concentrations released by pbmcs varied between different donors, ns <dig> induced more significant increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine il <dig>  while less impact on release of proinflammatory cytokine il <dig>  in comparation with probiotic strain l. casei shirota, which has been well characterized with health-promoting functions . the ratio of il <dig> to il <dig> production was higher for ns <dig>  than l. casei shirota . both strains were able to induce tnf-α secretion from stimulated pbmcs, but the induction of this cytokine was partly lower when pbmcs were stimulated by ns <dig>  these results indicated that il- <dig> producing immune cells could evidently sense the stimulation of ns <dig> fig.  <dig> cytokine response of human pbmcs to stimulation with l. helveticus ns <dig> and l. casei shirota strains. cell supernatant were collected after 24 h co-incubation with bacteria , and the release of il- <dig>  and il-12p <dig>  and tnf-α  were assayed by elisa. results were represented as means ± sem pg/ml for  <dig> independent healthy donors



modulation the proinflammatory response triggered by lps
in a final set of experiments, we tested the effects of ns <dig> on lps-evoked inflammatory responses by analyzing the gene expression of two proinflammatory factors through qpcr, tnf-α and il- <dig>  and the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> in mouse macrophage cell line raw <dig> . here we also investigated whether the s-layer protein is involved in immunomodulatory activity exerted by ns <dig>  after 4 h of co-stimulation of the raw <dig>  cells with lps, ns <dig> induced a pronounced anti-inflammatory profile, as evidenced by an dramatically enhanced induction of il- <dig> compared to the induction of tnf-α and il- <dig> . ns <dig> also decreased lps-induced proinflammatory il- <dig> production significantly . the reduction of il- <dig> induced by purified s-layer protein was similar to that induced by ns <dig> strain itself, however, the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> was not influenced by s-layer protein . the results obtained by employing lps-induced macrophages, therefore, confirmed the anti-inflammatory immune responses of ns <dig>  but not dependent on s-layer protein.fig.  <dig> modulation of the proinflammatory response triggered by lps in raw <dig>  mouse macrophages. raw <dig>  cells were stimulated with l. helveticus ns <dig>  or its s-layer protein , with or without co-incubation of 1 μg/ml lps for 4 h. expression profiles of il <dig> , il-12p <dig> , and tnf-α  were examined by quantitative real-time pcr, indicated as the relative levels to the induction level of the control, which was set at a value of  <dig>  results are the means ± sd of representative of three independent experiments. significant differences indicated as: **, p <  <dig> ; *, p <  <dig> 



discussion
as a traditionally fermented dairy product, koumiss has been getting more attentions for its healthy functions in recent years. the fermentation of koumiss depends on the action of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts  <cit> . so in our study, we tried to select promising probiotic strains with particular health-promoting functions from mongolian koumiss. after testing the tolerance ability to git environment and adherent potential to intestinal mucosa in vitro, we focused on a strain with good probiotic traits, l. helveticus ns <dig> 

comparative genomic studies have found that l. helveticus is rather closely related to the gut organism l. acidophilus although these two lactobacilli occupy different environmental niches  <cit> . however, l. helveticus dpc <dig> was reported to possess a frame-shifted nonfunctional bile salt hydrolase gene, which suggested genetic adaption to the dairy environment might occur during the evolution  <cit> . that perhaps explained at least some part of the reason why ns <dig> showed moderate survival ability in the  <dig>  % bile salt. interestingly, in a recent study, l. helveticus was detected in every pasturing area mongolian, but not in any of the city mongolian, based on the 16s rrna sequence analysis of human intestinal microbiota  <cit> . it suggested that dairy niche-specific bacteria, such as l. helveticus, still could survive and persist in human git under the condition of regular consumption. nevertheless, for sustaining adequate populations of viable bacteria, we already developed enteric capsules of live ns <dig> bacteria.

when we tested the cellular surface properties of l. helveticus ns <dig>  we observed an impressive adhesive capacity of ns <dig> to the human intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. although some well adopted commercial probiotic strains showed adhesion as high as 15 % or as low as 2 %, the ability to adhere to the intestinal epithelium or mucosal surface had been considered as a major distinguishing feature for probiotic strains  <cit> . after adherence, probiotic bacteria should be able to autoaggregate and colonize in the gut for extending the interaction periods  <cit> . compared with some other proposed probiotic strains, ns <dig> showed a significant autoaggregation in a very short time. that suggested the adherent cells of ns <dig> could potentially form a protective biofilm-like communities via autoaggregation or co-aggregation with commensal organisms on the intestinal mucosa. this close interaction with host intestinal mucosa might lead to the competitive exclusion of pathogens or the modulation of host cell responses  <cit> .

due to the importance of understanding immunological aspects when defining the probiotic potential, we mainly aimed to define whether l. helveticus ns <dig> could exert immunomodulatory effects to hosts. firstly, in order to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of ns <dig>  a standardized murine model of acute colitis induced by  <dig> , <dig>  trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid  was applied by orally administered ns <dig> bacteria  <cit> . the prophylactic impact of ns <dig> strain was proven by observing that the weight loss and tissue damage were significantly alleviated. recent increasing evidences indicated that both the systemic and mucosal immune systems can be modulated by orally delivered bacteria  <cit> . foligne et al. proposed that in vitro il-10/il- <dig> cytokine induction ratio on pbmcs closely matched the ranking of the in vivo protective effect against tnbs-induced colitis in mice  <cit> . in agreement with the prevention in vivo, the il-10/il- <dig> ratio obtained after pbmcs stimulation confirmed a significant potential in the immunomodulatory properties of ns <dig>  it is widely accepted that the health-promoting properties attributed to probiotics are multiple and strain-specific. indeed, some lactobacillus strains were shown as strong inducers of il- <dig> and tnf-α, while in our study, ns <dig> was shown to be a strong inducer of il- <dig>  similar immune responses could also be observed upon exposure to proinflammatory stimulus lps, which is one of the best studied systemic inflammation inducer via simulation of toll-like receptor <dig> pathway  <cit> . ns <dig> was able to reduce lps-evoked inflammatory responses in mouse macrophage cell line raw <dig>  by inhibiting lps-induced il- <dig> production, while promoting higher levels of il- <dig> in the presence of lps compared to the levels induced by lps alone. these results are important. il- <dig> plays a central role in down-regulating inflammatory cascades and maintaining gut homeostasis  <cit> . several studies also indicated that selective probiotics induce il- <dig> production in the intestine or the development of il-10-producing t cells in vitro, depending on the tlrs pathways  <cit> . however, the precise mechanism by which specific strain induces il-10-producing regulatory t cells remained unknown.

specific probiotic characteristics of lactobacilli have been associated with the presence of particular surface molecules or structures, such as peptidoglycan, teichoic acids, exopolysaccharides and surface proteins, to evoke different host responses  <cit> . for instance, s-layer protein  of l. acidophilus ncfm mediated the interaction of the bacteria with the ligand of the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig> -grabbing nonintegrin  and regulated dc immune functions  <cit> . s-layers are macromolecular paracrystalline arrays of proteins or glycoproteins commonly found in bacteria and archaea  <cit> . some of these proteins were proven mediating the bacterium’s ability to antagonize pathogens, due to the capability of s-layer protein to efficiently adhere to the intestinal epithelium  <cit> . as to ns <dig>  absence of s-layer proteins promoted apparent morphology change of bacterial cells, suggesting that s-layer proteins are quite important for the surface property of ns <dig>  except that, purified slpa protein of l. acidophilus ncfm was also responsible for the anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, because the protein induced higher levels of il- <dig> in the presence of lps  <cit> . however, our results suggested that the s-layer protein isolated from ns <dig> mainly attenuated lps-induced il- <dig> levels in macrophages, while didn’t influence the expression levels of il- <dig>  in contrast, the s-layer protein of l. helveticus mimlh <dig> induced a proinflammatory effects in human u <dig> macrophages and macrophages isolated from mouse bone marrow   <cit> . such different data can be explained by considering the difference in surface proteins and different cell types used. the exact role of s-layer proteins in immune reactions remains elusive. to elucidate the molecular mechanisms determining the immunomodulatory capacity of ns <dig>  the specific interactions between bacterial ligand and host receptor need to be learned in further study.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, ns <dig> isolate of l. helveticus from mongolian fermented koumiss was identified as a good probiotic strain, based on the probiotic factors and immunomodulatory capacities. ns <dig> showed good hydrophobicity, cellular autoaggregation, cell adhesive capacity to enterocytes, and the presence of s-layer protein. moreover, ns8-induced improvement in murine colitis is associated with the up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> in pbmcs and lps-stimulated murine macrophage cell line raw <dig> . the present study indicates that ns <dig> can be useful in the development of nutraceutical products for the prevention or treatment of inflammation-associated diseases. future studies should continue to address the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects, taking into account the particular cell surface structures or metabolites of lactobacilli which influence the interaction with the host.
