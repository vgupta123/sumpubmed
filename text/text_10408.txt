BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions  are important for regulating many biological functions. it has been suggested that the human interactome involves about  <dig>  interactions  <cit>  and disrupting these interactions could be an attractive way to block a number of targets involved in different pathologies  <cit> . a possible strategy to inhibit undesired ppis is to design small organic molecules binding in the zone of interactions and the increasing number of such recent success stories prove it  <cit> . yet, it is difficult to efficiently target ppis due to large and flat interfaces  <cit> , the nature of the chemicals present in chemical libraries  <cit> , and in particular due to the structural changes that can occur upon ligand binding. in some cases, small structural changes have been observed at the ppis interfaces due to small inhibitors' binding  <cit> . other proteins, i.e. calmodulin, undergo considerable conformational changes due to protein or small ligand binding  <cit> . indeed, limitations in describing potential small-molecule binding sites have been noted when using static structures of either the unbound protein or the protein-protein complex  <cit> .

some early designed inhibitors of ppis mimic short secondary-structural elements of proteins  <cit> . other molecules, like the terphenyl and its derivates , were shown to be able to inhibit several ppis  <cit> , e.g. terphenyls disrupt the calmodulin  interactions with smooth muscle myosin light-chain kinase , with 3'-5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, or with the helical peptide c20w of the plasma membrane calcium pump  <cit> .

we exploit here docking of 1-naphthyl terphenyl  into two homologous ca2+-binding proteins, cam and human centrin  <dig> , to find out the cam and hscen <dig> conformations that could efficiently be employed for further structure-based design of inhibitors of ppis. cam and hscen <dig> have a high sequence homology  and display a structural similarity as both proteins are composed by two ef-hand n- and c-terminal domains connected by a helical linker . the binding of 1-naphthyl terphenyl by cam  has already been shown experimentally  <cit> . following the strong similarity between the two ca2+-binding proteins we probe in this study a potential terphenyl binding into hscen <dig> 

cam is expressed in all eukaryotic cells and interacts with a large number of different protein targets  <cit> , being thus involved in regulation of different cellular processes, such as cell division and differentiation, ion transport, muscle contraction, etc.  <cit> . ca2+-binding induces a rearrangement of the tertiary structure of ef-hand domains of cam  <cit>  with an exposure of a large hydrophobic cavity promoting the association of a wide array of target proteins, including kinases, cyclases, various cell surface receptors, etc. cam displays a multitude of conformational states  <cit> . modulation of physiological targets of cam through cam inhibition by small natural or synthetic compounds  <cit>  may guide discovery of new therapeutic agents.

centrins are involved in the centrosome duplication  <cit> , in the nuclear excision repair  mechanism  <cit>  or in the multiple nuclear export pathways  <cit> . ner is an essential molecular mechanism responsible for repairing of dna lesions caused by uv light or antitumor agents like cis-platin. cis-platin resistance in chemotherapy is a major complication in cancer and seems to be associated with the stimulation of ner dna repair mechanism  <cit> . centrin forms a heterotrimeric complex with xpc  and hhr23b proteins, which play a key role in the dna damage recognition. recent in vivo and in vitro studies  <cit>  revealed that hscen <dig> binds to a 17-mer peptide  of xpc protein  with a high affinity in the presence of ca2+ . human cell lines expressing a mutant xpc protein  exhibited in vitro and in vivo a significant reduction of ner activity  <cit> . thus, inhibition of centrin-xpc interactions involved in the ner mechanism might be an efficient way to modulate these processes.

structural changes occurring at ppis interfaces make difficult to successfully proceed to structure-based drug design/virtual screening of novel small molecules inhibiting ppis  <cit> . selecting appropriate conformations, taking into account the protein plasticity, could be a valuable starting point for subsequent structure-based virtual screening studies. one possibility to incorporate the protein receptor flexibility for ligand docking is to explore multiple receptor conformations   <cit> , either experimental  <cit>  or modeled  <cit> . once the mrc selected, ligand candidates can be docked into each receptor conformation and the results from each docking run can be combined together in a post-processing step  <cit> . recent papers showed examples of using nmr ensembles of the protein receptor for docking and screening processes  <cit> . in this work we performed in silico analysis and docking of 1-naphthyl terphenyl into nmr ensembles of cam and hscen <dig> that revealed a small set of nmr conformations appropriate to perform further structure-based virtual screening for discovering of small ppis inhibitors.

RESULTS
protein-protein binding site analysis
cam and hscen <dig> share about 50% sequence homology extending even to the positions of side chains in the hydrophobic core of the proteins. the main difference between them is the presence in hscen <dig> of a  <dig> amino acids n-terminal ending region . both proteins possess four ef-hands, but for hscen <dig> only the ef hands belonging to the c-terminal domain bind ca2+ ions  <cit>  with a significant affinity . we should note the high sequence homology of the c-terminal domains of these two ca2+-binding proteins , especially in the binding sites . the superposition of cam and hscen <dig> structures shows their strong structural similarity . the root mean square deviations  between the carbon alpha atoms of the cam and hscen <dig> structures shown in figure 2b is  <dig>  Å, whereas the rmsd between the two c-terminal domains is  <dig>  Å.

the flexible helical linker between n- and c-terminal domains enables the switch between different conformational states of cam and hscen <dig>  figures 2b and 2c show two conformations of cam, namely an "extended" mode  and a "wrap-around" mode , respectively. in the last one, the central helix becomes partially unstructured and the helices of the n-terminal domain point toward the bound trifluorperasine molecules. it has been demonstrated that the c-terminal domain of cam  binds several peptides/proteins  <cit> . similarly, the terphenyl molecule , binds exclusively into the c-domain of cam  <cit> . the residues w <dig>  t <dig> and v <dig> of smmlck  are critical for the interaction with c-cam  <cit> .

similarly, hscen <dig> undergoes important conformational changes depending on the presence of a bound ligand   <cit> . in the hscen2/p17-xpc complex, the alpha-helical linker between the two domains undertakes an extended form , and in the unliganded form the same region closes the c-terminal peptide binding site . structural studies showed that hscen <dig> binds the 17-mer xpc peptide only by its c-terminal domain and the w <dig>  l <dig> and l <dig> residues  of the p17-xpc have been shown as critical anchoring side chains  <cit> . thermodynamic studies  <cit>  enabled the definition of a minimal centrin binding site, a peptide of five residues, which accounted for about 75% of the total free energy of interaction between the two proteins.

the above presented data indicate that the c-terminal domains of both ca2+-binding proteins are more functional regarding the peptides binding. therefore, we explored the c-terminal domains of cam and hscen <dig> for potential small ligands' binding. we analyzed several x-ray structures and nmr ensembles of both proteins to construct a relevant ensemble of multiple receptor conformations for the docking process of 1-naphthyl terphenyl. the selected sets contained crystal structures as well as  <dig> nmr structures  and  <dig> nmr structures for c-cam and c-hscen <dig>  respectively . the selected nmr and x-ray structures of c-cam and c-hscen <dig> are shown in figure  <dig>  the residue numbers correspond to the ones in the nmr files, 2k0f for cam and 2a4j for hscen <dig> 

docking of terphenyl
the docking-scoring protocol employed to dock 1-naphthyl terphenyl into the selected structures is shown in figure  <dig> . in order to identify the "best" protein conformations for further analysis, we calculated the rmsd between each pose obtained after docking with dock <dig>   <cit>  and the reference points of smmlck and p17-xpc for cam and hscen <dig>  respectively . the obtained rmsd values are shown in figure 5a and 5b. overall, docking results are best for the structures of c-hscen <dig>  we compared the binding zones of the two proteins to analyze these results. for c-cam, the binding pocket consists of one cavity  containing residues f <dig>  i <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig>  e <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig>  the residue f <dig> placed in the center of the binding zone is in contact with w <dig> and t <dig> of the smmlck peptide. the binding site of hscen <dig> is larger  and consists of two hydrophobic cavities separated by f <dig> interacting with l <dig> of the p17-xpc peptide, and l <dig> and m <dig> interacting with w <dig> of the peptide. the close contact of f <dig> and l <dig> of the bound peptide has also been observed in the structure of hscen <dig> complexed with another protein partner targeting the same hscen <dig> zone  <cit> . the deeper and bigger cavity contains the residues f <dig>  i <dig>  e <dig>  v <dig>  i <dig> and m <dig>  and the smaller one contains the residues l <dig>  v <dig>  a <dig>  l <dig>  l <dig> and m <dig>  the replacement of one met residue  of c-cam with a smaller one, an ala residue , enlarges the hydrophobic cavity of the c-hscen <dig>  this facilitates a potential anchoring of 1-naphthyl terphenyl into the c-hscen <dig> 

we also compared the flexibility of the binding zone of cam and hscen <dig>  by analyzing the b-factors of the carbon alpha atoms for all residues in the binding pocket of hscen <dig> complexed with p17-xpc, as well as for a few complexes of human cam interacting with helical peptides of similar length as p17-xpc . this analysis showed an enhanced flexibility of cam in a bound state, in the region 107- <dig> compared to the binding zone 132- <dig> of hscen <dig>  structural comparison of these complexes suggested that this difference would be mainly due to a higher mobility of the k <dig> side chain of cam compared to n <dig> of hscen <dig>  moreover, we should note the presence of four met residues in the binding site of c-cam  and two met residues in the pocket of c-hscen <dig> . the flexible nature of the met side chains at the binding surface has previously been discussed as a critical factor to facilitate the surface complementarity between cam and its partner  <cit> . this analysis shows a higher plasticity of the binding pocket of the c-cam than the c-hscen <dig>  and, therefore, more structural arrangements might occur for the c-cam than for the c-hscen <dig> upon ligand binding.

the 3d electrostatic potential distribution on the x-ray c-cam and c-hscen <dig> surfaces  indicates that overall c-cam is more negatively charged than c-hscen2; this could be related with the stronger affinity of ca2+ for cam than hscen <dig>  <cit> . this observation is also valid for the binding zone of the c-cam and c-hscen <dig>  the presence of a large number of negatively charged residues in both proteins, and especially in c-cam, resulted in several computed abnormal pka values for c-cam:  <dig>  for e <dig>   <dig>  for d <dig>  and  <dig>  for e136; for hscen2:  <dig>  for d <dig> and  <dig>  for d <dig> . the mean local hydrophobic density calculated using fpocket tool  <cit>  was  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the binding pockets of c-cam and c-hscen <dig>  respectively. following these results, we can speculate that the higher hydrophobicity of c-hscen <dig> binding zone might facilitate a potential binding of the hydrophobic 1-naphthyl terphenyl.

the rmsd results allowed to retain for further analysis five best nmr models for the c-hscen <dig> and c-cam, in addition to the x-ray structures . as can be seen for both proteins better docking poses were obtained when docking on some of the nmr conformations compared to the x-ray ones. the binding pockets of the five best nmr models have larger volumes than the x-ray structures for both proteins. for c-cam, the cavity is deeper in the selected nmr models  than in the x-ray structure . the binding pocket of the x-ray structure of hscen <dig>  is much smaller than those of the best five nmr models , that obviously makes easier the terphenyl docking into these nmr structures. we suggest that this observation would be valid as well for other small ligands' docking. the large difference between the pocket volumes of the best nmr models and x-ray structure of c-hscen <dig> is due to the orientation of two residues, f <dig> and f <dig>  that fill a large part of the binding cavity in the x-ray structure. similar situation was observed for c-cam and f <dig> 

poses' refinement and interaction energy analysis
as previously shown  <cit> , post-docking optimization may help to further improve both docking poses and scores. we performed additional energetic analysis  of docking poses on the selected best mrc to optimize the predicted binding modes and to re-calculate the interaction energies taking into account desolvation effects due to ligand binding. firstly, we carried out an energy minimization of the docking poses on the selected nmr conformations and x-ray structures of both proteins using the program ammos  <cit> . the included flexible side chains of the protein receptor around the bound terphenyl enabled to relax the complex structures in the binding pocket. the energy gain due to the ammos relaxation for the best scored poses is shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the important energy decrease during this step is due to reducing clashes between the docked ligand and some residues of the protein binding pocket, as well as internal ligand energy optimization. figure  <dig> represents the side-chain orientations after the energy minimization for the different docking poses. the residues slightly moving due to the optimization are f <dig>  l <dig>  m <dig>  e <dig>  m <dig>  e <dig>  and m <dig> for cam  and f <dig>  l <dig>  e <dig>  m <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> for hscen <dig> . interestingly, it can be seen that met residues m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> are among the moving residues, as discussed above. as seen in figure  <dig>  the changes due to the optimization are not very large, still small variations of the docked complex structure can affect the interaction energy prediction . it has been previously discussed that even small receptor movements can lead to important modifications into the molecular recognition pattern and/or binding energy prediction errors  <cit> . to this end, the ammos refinement step could be useful to "rescue" some docking poses with bad energy score after docking on a rigid receptor .

the column  <dig> shows the rmsd of the poses as predicted by dock.

further, we employed re-scoring with the gbsa hawking model as implemented in dock <dig> , and re-scoring with x-score  <cit>  on the ammos optimized docked complex structures. tables  <dig> and  <dig> show the top scored poses retrieved by each of the methods: dock, ammos, gbsa and x-score. we consider docking poses of bound terphenyl within  <dig>  Å rmsd as acceptable. the best protein conformations for cam and hscen <dig> were found by consensus between ammos, gbsa and x-score re-scoring if the best score corresponds to a good rmsd pose. among the twelve protein structures, 1cll, 2k0f model  <dig>  and 2k0f model  <dig> were considered as "bad" because no one of the re-scoring methods ammos, gbsa and x-score retrieved good docking poses. the ammos energy and x-score retrieved good docking poses for  <dig> out of the  <dig> remaining acceptable cases. gbsa scoring found good poses for  <dig> out of the  <dig> acceptable cases. figure  <dig> illustrates one good and one bad solutions found by gbsa. in the case of nmr model  <dig> of c-hscen <dig>  , gbsa retrieved a good docking pose. however, for the nmr model  <dig> of c-cam, , the pose retrieved by gbsa is completely upside-down. gbsa failed to find the good poses in  <dig> out of  <dig> possible cases. similar problems  have already been found in other docking studies  <cit> . it might be possible that a further optimization of the docked complexes including an implicit solvent or explicit water molecules during the minimization would be useful for a more successful re-scoring with the gbsa method.

the results in table  <dig> reveal the best c-cam conformations suitable for further structure-based drug design/virtual screening: the best one is 2k0f model  <dig> where the good docking poses were found by the three re-scoring scoring methods; the models 2k0f  <dig> and  <dig> are acceptable with good poses found by ammos and x-score. in the case of hscen <dig> , the 2a4j models  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> appear to be best ones where the three re-scoring methods retrieved the good docking poses; the 2a4j model  <dig> is acceptable with good poses found again by ammos and x-score.

CONCLUSIONS
this work highlights that scoring and docking accuracy strongly depend on considering the receptor flexibility, either large conformational changes or small side-chain adjustments in the protein-protein binding region occur. exploiting the nmr ensembles could be very helpful to take into account the receptor conformational changes into docking/virtual screening exercises. local induced-fit optimization in a protein-ligand complex structure can be achieved by using the ammos method. we explored docking of terphenyl on a number of nmr conformations vs x-ray structures of cam and hscen <dig>  using the nmr ensembles of the receptor structure substantially improved the docking and scoring compared to the x-ray structures. our study provided a minimal set of conformations of cam and hscen <dig> suitable for small ligand docking/virtual screening targeting the cam and hscen <dig> interactions. the comparative structural and energetic analysis of the binding sites of both proteins demonstrate large similarities and some differences. all together these data can be valuable for a future design of small ppis inhibitors for cam and hscen <dig>
