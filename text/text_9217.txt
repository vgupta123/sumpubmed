BACKGROUND
cellular senescence is an irreversible growth-arrest programme that limits cell proliferation in an organism. this process may contribute to physiological aging, a complex phenomenon that involves the interplay of multiple genetic and environmental factors, resulting in the diminishing capacity of tissues to respond to stress and injury  <cit> . many experimental models have been established for studying this fundamental process. replicative senescence is one of the most commonly used model systems. some of the morphological and molecular events in senescence can be reproduced by the repeated passage of mammalian cells in tissue culture, possibly due to telomere deprotection. senescence can be accelerated by subjecting cultured cells to chemical or genotoxic stress, such as sodium butyrate  <cit> , mtx  <cit> , irradiation  <cit>  or by overexpressing the oncogenic ras gene  <cit> . in addition, the contributions of specific genes to the regulation of senescence have been studied by using cell lines derived from patients of accelerated aging diseases, such as werner's disease  <cit> . finally, transgenic animals have been created as models for accelerated aging diseases  <cit> . for example, lamin a knockout mice manifest symptoms of pre-mature aging diseases. another line of transgenic mice that lacked zmpste <dig>  an enzyme that aids in the maturation of pre-lamin a to lamin a, also demonstrate accelerated aging phenotypes  <cit> .

the association of mutations in lamins and lamin-related proteins with accelerated aging phenotypes in humans suggests the possible role of nuclear shape and organization in the regulation of senescence. it is known that the nuclear architecture changes during the natural aging of wild-type caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . major changes in chromatin organization, with the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci , have also been observed in cultured human fibroblasts when senescence was induced by overexpressing the ras oncogene  <cit> . apart from the nuclear envelope and chromatin, the most common cellular orgenelle associated with aging is the nucleolus. many of the proteins mutated in human premature aging syndromes  <cit>  are localized in the nucleolus at least during part of the cell cycle or under some other conditions. for example, the wild-type werner syndrome protein is partially localized in the nucleoli, where it may be involved in rdna transcription  <cit> . similarly, the cockayne syndrome b  protein is also nucleolar  <cit> . the blm protein, mutated in the bloom syndrome, is present in the nucleolus during the s phase  <cit> , while the rothmund-thomson disease protein recql <dig> accumulates in the nucleolus during oxidative stress  <cit> . in addition, dyskerin, a protein mutated in the premature aging disease, dyskeratosis congenital, is associated with snornas  <cit>  and telomerase rna, are also localized in the nucleoli and cajal bodies  <cit> . the intranuclear localization of these proteins hint at the possible role of the nucleolus in aging in response to cumulative stress sustained by cells over time, or to the maintenance of the proliferative capacity of stem cells essential for tissue repair.

a more direct demonstration of the role of nucleoli in aging comes from observations in which some mutations in budding yeast can lead to an extension in life span  <cit> . for example, cells with mutations in the sir <dig> gene can live for 50% longer. sir <dig> encodes a protein that exists in a complex with sir2p and sir3p, which is linked with transcriptional silencing. remarkably, sir3p is localized at the telomeres and hm loci in young yeast cells, but relocate to the nucleolus in old cells. furthermore, life-extending mutations of sir <dig> can also cause the sir2/3/4p complex to accumulate in the nucleolus. these findings show that, at least in yeast, the composition of nucleoli changes as the cell ages, and that these changes are functionally linked to the control of lifespan. the redistribution of sir protein from telomeres to nucleoli as yeast ages is echoed by the detection of telomeric components in mammalian nucleoli. tomlinson et al.  <cit>  examined the intracellular distribution of telomerase rna and telomerase reverse transcriptase in hela cells, and reported their localization in nucleoli and cajal bodies during the s phase, which implicates that both these structures are involved in the biogenesis and trafficking of telomerase. telomerase can also interact with nucleolin  <cit> , an abundant multi-functional nucleolar protein. in mammalian cells, telomere shortening initiates senescence by activating p <dig>  the central regulator of cellular stress responses, and thereby signalling to the cell cycle checkpoint pathways, which are also activated by dna damage  <cit> . the nucleolus once again plays a crucial role in regulating the activity and stability of p <dig>  <cit> . the nucleolar protein arf regulates the ubiquitination and degradation of p <dig>  other p <dig> interacting proteins, such as nucleostemin  <cit> , and ing1b  <cit>  are also found in the nucleoli, which suggests that nucleolar targeting of p53-regulating proteins is a common mechanism for the activation of p <dig> and hence, all p53-related pathways. notably, nucleostemin is a nucleolar gtp-binding protein highly enriched in the stem cells and cancer cells, but absent in differentiated cells  <cit> . manipulation of nucleostemin expression levels leads to changes in senescent phenotypes of mouse cells  <cit> .

the nucleolus is the largest organelle in a mammalian nucleus and the site of ribosomal subunit production. recent studies have revealed that nucleolus also plays a significant role in other cellular functions. new techniques for studying the nucleolus are starting to provide insights into these non-conventional functions of this organelle. the human nucleolus has been the subject of some of the largest organellar proteomic efforts  <cit> . almost  <dig> proteins have been characterized, and out of which at present time about 30% are uncharacterized genes. silac-based quantitative mass spectrometry has been successfully applied to study the effect of transcription inhibition on the protein composition of the nucleolus  <cit> . more recently, this technique has been used to study the effect of viral infections on hela cell nucleolar proteome  <cit> . in this study, we used this high throughput quantitative mass spectrometry-based approach to map global changes in nucleolar proteome in stress induced senescent cells and provide for the first time, a biochemical snapshot of this organelle in senescent mouse fibroblast cells.

nucleolar isolation
nucleolar isolation was performed according to the published protocol with the following modifications for nih3t <dig> cells http://www.lamondlab.com/f7nucleolarprotocol.htm. the nih3t <dig> cells were dounce homogenized  <dig> times which is enough to break open the plasma membrane without disrupting the nucleus. we sonicated the isolated nuclei for  <dig> ×  <dig> sec at amplitude of 30%  to break open the nuclear membrane without disrupting the nucleolus.

silac labeling and mass spectrometry
for silac labeling, prior to nucleolar isolation, all cells were metabolically labeled by growing five rounds of cell divisions in a silac dmem medium supplemented with 10% dialysed fetal calf serum  to ensure all the cellular proteins were labeled to saturation. all isotopically labeled amino acids were purchased from cambridge isotope lab. untreated control cells were labeled with dmem that contained l-13c6-arginine  and l- <dig> , <dig> -d4-lysine , whereas sodium butyrate-treated cells were cultured in dmem that contained l-arginine  and l-lysine .

protein amounts of nucleolar lysates were estimated by a bradford assay . nucleolar protein fractions from control and treated cells were mixed at a 1: <dig> protein amount. the combined protein sample was separated by electrophoresis as above. the gel was then fixed , stained with colloidal coomassie blue  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the gel lane was cut into  <dig> slices. the gel slices were destained with a destaining solution  according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by incubation in  <dig> mm ammonium bicarbonate that contained proteomic grade trypsin   overnight at 37°c. the resulting peptides were extracted from each gel slice, analyzed by lc-ms on an ltq-orbitrap mass spectrometer system  coupled to a dionex  <dig> nano-lc system . the peptide mixture was loaded onto an lc-packings pepmap c <dig> column trap column  equilibrated in  <dig> % tfa in water at  <dig> μl/min, and washed for  <dig> min at the same flow rate, and then the trap column was switched in-line with an lc-packings pepmap c <dig> column  equilibrated in  <dig> % formic acid/water. the peptides were separated with a 55-min discontinuous gradient of acetonitrile/ <dig> % formic acid  at a flow rate of  <dig> nl/min and the hplc was interfaced to the mass spectrometer with an fs360-20- <dig> picotip  fitted to a nanospray  <dig> interface  with a voltage of  <dig>  kv applied to the liquid junction.

the orbitrap was set to analyze the survey scans at  <dig>  resolution and the top five ions in each duty cycle selected for ms/ms in the ltq linear ion trap. the raw files were processed to generate a mascot generic file by using the program raw2msm  <cit>  and searched against the uniprot human database by using the mascot search engine v. <dig>   run on an in-house server with the following criteria; peptide tolerance =  <dig> ppm, trypsin as the enzyme and carboxyamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification. variable modifications were the oxidation of methionine, and appropriate silac labels. proteins with a total mascot peptide scores below  <dig> were ignored, based on the decoy reversed database searching.

quantitation was performed by using the program ms-quant http://msquant.sourceforge.net, with peptide ratios calculated for each arginine- and/or lysine-containing peptide as the peak area of labeled arginine/lysine divided by the peak area of nonlabeled arginine/lysine for each single-scan mass spectrum. peptide ratios for all arginine- and lysine-containing peptides sequenced for each protein were averaged. ms-quant measures the silac ratio of each peptide throughout the elution of the ion pairs  <cit> , generating an averaged ratio for the identified peptide. standard deviations of the averaged protein ratios estimate the variability of measured silac ratios for all the detected peptides for each protein. individual spectra were inspected by using qualbrowser software . proteincenter  proteomics data mining and management software was used to eliminate redundancy and compare datasets, and convert protein ids to gene symbols and perform initial gene ontology characterization.

RESULTS
sodium butyrate induces senescence in nih3t <dig> cells
we used sodium butyrate treatment of nih3t <dig> cells as a model system to study the effect of senescence on nucleolar proteome in mammalian cells  <cit> . following treatment with  <dig> mm sodium butyrate for  <dig> days, nih3t <dig> cells adopted a flattened morphology with spread-out cytoplasms, large nuclei  and in many cases, the cells were multinucleated. the treated cells grew at a slower rate than the control cells, but with little or no discernible cell death . a flow cytometry analysis showed that the treated cells are blocked in the g0/g <dig> phase of the cell cycle with a reduced s-phase population . to confirm that the phenotypes we observed were results of chemically induced senescence, but not pharmacological cell cycle blockage, we performed a senescence associated -β-gal assay on the sodium butyrate-treated and mock-treated cells. sa-β-gal assay measures the activity of β- galactosidase, a widely used biomarker for senescent cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 1d, the nih3t <dig> cells show blue coloration  after  <dig> days of sodium butyrate treatment, whereas control cells are unstained. taken together, sodium butyrate induces senescence in nih3t <dig> cells.

isolation of nucleolus from normal and senescent nih3t <dig> cells
to study the changes in the nucleolar protein composition following senescence induction in nih3t <dig> cells, we performed silac-based quantitative proteomics on nucleoli isolated from mock and sodium butyrate treated cells. in this approach, a population of nih3t <dig> cells were cultured in a medium that contained heavy isotope-labeled arginine and lysine , and another population in the same medium, except that the arginine and lysine were not isotopically labeled . to ensure complete labeling, the cells were first cultured in these media for  <dig> days, and then for the next four days, they were either mock treated  or sodium butyrate treated  while still in their respective labeled media . there was no observable effect of the use of silac media on cell growth and responses to sodium butyrate . following the treatment, nucleoli were isolated from four  <dig> cm dishes of treated cells and the same number of untreated control by using an established protocol. the nuclei were first isolated from the cells, and the nucleoli were released from the nuclei by sonication and then purified from the nucleoplasmic fraction by a sucrose cushion. a microscopy analysis of the isolated nuclei and nucleoli  demonstrated the intactness and purity of these fractions. a western blotting analysis of the cytosolic, nucleoplasmic and the nucleolar lysates with antibodies for fibrillarin , lamin a/c  and actin  confirmed the purity of that of the respective subcellular fractions . equal amounts of proteins from nucleoli isolated from control and butyrate-treated cells were mixed, separated by sds-page, and in-gel digested by trypsin . the resulting peptides were analyzed by nano-esi-lc-ms/ms.

the nucleolar proteome during senescence
we have identified and quantified a relative abundance of  <dig> proteins from a proteomic comparison of the senescent and control nucleoli . the proteomic analysis indicated that the detected proteins in mouse nih3t <dig> nucleoli cover a similar functional spectrum as the human nucleolar proteomes previously reported  <cit> . this confirms the strong conservation of the compositions and functions of the nucleolus  <cit> . the response of the nucleolar proteome to chemically induced senescence is highly distinct from that of other perturbations  <cit> . with some notable exceptions, most nucleolar proteins appear to be depleted from the nucleolus as a result of transcriptional inhibition by actinomycin d treatment  <cit> . in sodium butyrate treated nih3t <dig> cells, however, there is an overall accumulation of proteins in the nucleolus, with only a small subset of proteins found to be down-regulated following the treatment . this observation demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the nucleolus, which responds differently to distinct metabolic conditions. for example, ribosomal proteins are shown to accumulate in the nucleolus of sodium butyrate treated cells , but depleted from the nucleolus in actinomycin d treated cells whereas in adenoviral infected cells, the abundance of ribosomal proteins in the nucleolus is largely unaffected  <cit> . interestingly, many proteins related to ribosomal biogenesis, such as pop <dig>  rrp <dig>  rrp <dig>  bap <dig>  are depleted from the nucleolus after sodium butyrate treatment. the opposite behaviours of ribosomal proteins and ribosomal biogenesis factors suggest a possible shift in the kinetics of ribosome assembly in senescent cells. histones and chromatin remodeling factors, such as chd <dig>  rbbp <dig>  and chd <dig>  also dramatically accumulate in the nucleolus upon treatment with sodium butyrate, which implies a major change of chromatin organization in the nucleolus during senescence . taken together, our quantitative proteomic analysis offers a unique overview of the biochemical impact of chemically induced senescence on the nucleolus.

biochemical validation of the proteomic results from mass spectrometry
we selected three proteins identified by proteomic analysis out of  <dig> proteins that were shown to change in abundance in nucleoli in sodium butyrate treated cells, and validated the silac results by traditional techniques. following sodium butyrate induced senescence, the nucleolar amount of b <dig> was down-regulated with a ratio of  <dig> , while ndhii  and parp <dig> were up-regulated with a ratio of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the amount of b <dig>  ndh ii and parp <dig> in the nucleolar lyaste of sodium butyrate treated cells was compared to control cells by western blotting as shown in figure 3a. we found that the b <dig> protein level is indeed down-regulated while the protein levels of parp and ndh ii are up-regulated following the sodium butyrate treatment. to further characterize the decrease of b <dig> in the nucleolus of senescent nih3t <dig> cells, we observed the subcellular distribution of b <dig> in treated and control cells by immunofluoresence. consistent with the ms and western blotting results, the nucleolar staining by anti-b <dig> in sodium butyrate treated nih3t <dig> cells is clearly weaker than that in untreated cells . interestingly, there is a corresponding increase of b <dig> labeling in the nucleoplasm of the sodium butyrate cells, which suggests that the observed decrease in the abundance of nucleolar b <dig> may reflect a re-distribution of this protein from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm.

reorganization of the nucleolus after sodium butyrate treatmet
from our proteomic analysis, we observed that there was an upregulation in the proteins related to chromatin remodeling following induction of senescence in nih3t <dig> cells with sodium butyrate. to further study this effect, we stained the control and sodium butyrate treated cells with dna dye hoechst  <dig> and observed the nuclei with high magnification under confocal microscope. when the butyrate-treated nih3t <dig> cells were stained with dna dye hoechst  <dig>  compared to control cells , we observed the presence of chromatin within the nucleoli of many treated cells . this probably reflects the increase in abundance of histones and other chromatin-related proteins as detected by ms. in untreated and mock-treated nih3t <dig> cells, clusters of chromatin centers  could be seen in the interphase nucleus, frequently associated with the nucleolar periphery, which are commonly observed in mouse cells. the core of the nucleoli is generally free of chromatin, an observation consistent with early electron microscopy studies  <cit> . within  <dig> days of sodium butyrate treatment, however, hoechst-labeled chromatin is found on the inside of some of the nucleoli of the treated nih3t <dig> cells . to quantitate the number of nucleoli that display intranucleolar chromatin, we counted  <dig> nucleoli in both controls, and  <dig> or  <dig> day sodium butyrate treated cells. we observed that there is about a 40% increase in the proportion of cells displaying nucleolar chromatin following  <dig> or  <dig> days of treatment .

sodium butyrate-induced nucleolar organization does not affect nucleolar rna synthesis
since heterochromatin is often associated with transcriptional silencing, we asked if the sodium-butyrate-induced accumulation of chromatin in the nucleolus is a reflection of an inhibition of nucleolar transcription. sodium butyrate-treated and mock-treated nih3t <dig> cells were pulsed with 5-fu and then immuno-cytochemically labeled for transcription sites . as shown in figure 4n, there was no detectable difference in the amount of 5-fu incorporation in the nucleolus after a sodium butyrate treatment, which indicates that sodium butyrate does not affect the rate of rna synthesis in the nucleolus. the appearance of chromatin inside the nucleolus and the re-distribution of b <dig> suggest a general re-organization of the nuclear structure as a result of the sodium butyrate treatment.

validation of results by using other senescence model systems
the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase  is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that has been implicated to be activated in response to stress in many cell lines, but increasing evidence also suggests that jnk plays a role in cell proliferation and survival  <cit>  too. it has been also demonstrated that in uv irradiated cells following jnk activation, c-jun translocates b <dig> out of the nucleolus  <cit> . since sodium butyrate induces an arrest of nih3t <dig> cells at g <dig>  it is important to verify whether the observed redistribution of b <dig> in the nucleolus in sodium butyrate treated cells is a senescence-specific event and not a collateral result of stress. to this end, we examined the nucleolar abundance of b <dig> in serum-starved nih3t <dig> cells for  <dig> hours. a facs analysis showed that over 98% of the cells are blocked in the g <dig> phase following serum starvation . to investigate the level of b <dig> protein, we isolated nucleoli from control and serum starved cells, and the protein amount was quantitated by using the bradford method. equal amounts of nucleolar protein were run on an sds-page. a western blotting analysis with an anti-b <dig> antibody showed that there is no observable alteration in the level of b <dig> protein in the serum starved cells compared to the control . this result demonstrates that the down-regulation of b <dig> protein levels in the nucleolus is not a general phenomenon of the g <dig> cell cycle block, but a sodium butyrate specific effect.

mitoxantrone  treated cells have been shown to undergo genotoxic stress-induced senescence in fibroblast cell lines by many laboratories  <cit> . since the cellular target for mtx is different from sodium butyrate, we chose to confirm our finding through mtx treatment with a concentration that has been known to induce senescence in cells. nine days after the mtx treatment, the nih3t <dig> cells demonstrated senescent morphology, with larger and flattened cells, and bigger nuclei which were positive in the sa-β-gal assay . we observed little toxicity, but also a slower proliferation in the mtx treated nih3t <dig> cells. upon a facs analysis of the propidium iodide stained mtx treated cells, we found 80% of the treated cells to be blocked in the g2/m phase after  <dig> days and following  <dig> days of treatment, a significant percentage  of the cells are still blocked in the g <dig> phase , in concurrence with the literature  <cit> . following  <dig> days of mtx treatment of nih3t <dig> cells, we fractionated the cells and checked for purity of the preparation by western blotting using b <dig> , lamin a/c  and actin  as markers . we found that upon mtx treatment, like sodium butyrate, leads to a redistribution of b <dig> to the nucleoplasm . the effect of mtx treatment on the level of nucleolar b <dig> protein is even more pronounced than sodium butyrate. furthermore, a similar appearance of chromatin in the nucleolus was also observed in mtx treated cells , which confirms that the observed re-organization of the nuclear structure in sodium butyrate treated cells is not a cellular response to particular chemicals, but more likely a general reflection of senescence.

to further confirm the observed nuclear re-organization in senescent cells, we utilized an animal model of aging. mutations in lmna have been shown to cause a whole range of pre-mature aging diseases, like the hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome , werner's syndrome  and cardiocutaneous progeria syndrome   <cit> . embryonic fibroblasts derived from lamin a knockout mice are a widely used model system to study senescence  <cit> . to investigate if mefs derived from the knockout mice display any changes in the b <dig> protein expression, we performed immunostaining for b <dig> protein. as expected, although we did not observe any changes in the total b <dig> protein level in the control and knockout mefs , but the distribution of b <dig> in the two compared cell lines are significantly different. we found that the mefs from knockout mice display diffused staining in the nucleus for b <dig>  as opposed to nucleolar staining in the control cells , with the appearance of chromatin in the nucleoli , which is consistent with our data in cells induced by either sodium butyrate or mtx. taken together, the redistribution of b <dig> and heterochromatin was observed in the nucleoli of senescent cells irrespective of the stimuli, and this suggests that it is a senescence specific effect and not due to the agent used to induce senescence.

there have been sporadic reports on the presence of condensed chromatin in the proximity of the nucleolus. for example, in human lymphocytes, it has been observed that some chromatin inclusions reside close to the fibrillar center in the nucleolus  <cit> . although dramatic heterochromatin reorganizations, including the formation of sahf, have been observed in senescent cells  <cit> , but these structures are not reportedly within the nucleolus. interestingly, we observed that in sodium butyrate treated mouse fibroblast cells, the chromatin re-organizes and relocates inside the nucleolus. histone h1x exhibits a cell-cycle-dependent change in its nuclear distribution and accumulates in the nucleolus during the g <dig> phase when treated with sodium butyrate and it was evenly distributed in the nucleus during the s phase and g <dig>  <cit> . in our proteomic screening of sodium butyrate treated mouse fibroblast senescent cells, we observed a general accumulation of histones in the nucleolus. we observed the same phenomenon in mtx-treated senescence cells, which is a g <dig> cell cycle block. we similarly also observed a chromatin relocation to the nucleolus in the primary lmna-/- mouse cells which is a well known mouse model system for studying pre-mature aging. so, we believe that it is not an effect of a cell cycle block, but a senescence specific effect, at least in mouse cells.

b <dig> is a nucleolar phospho-protein, which plays a role in cellular proliferation, cell survival, ribosomal biogenesis, aiding in ribosome assembly  <cit>  and also surveillance of oncogenic insults in cells  <cit> . in the present study, we found that upon sodium butyrate treatment, the ribosomal biogenesis in the nucleolus is down-regulated with b <dig> being relocated from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm of mouse fibroblast. apart from its proliferative and nucleolar role, several lines of evidence indicate that b <dig> can be used as a biomarker for hematopoietic leukaemia  <cit> . several point mutations on b <dig> have been detected in acute myelogenous leukemia  patients that also have been shown to translocate b <dig> protein from nucleolus to the nucleus and cytoplasm. it has also been shown that when cells are stressed with uv irradiation, b <dig> moves away from the nucleolus  <cit> . hence, b <dig> may play a central role in influencing cellular proliferation and senescence in mammalian cells.

our study is the latest addition to a growing body of literature on the use of silac-based proteomics to examine nucleolar proteome dynamics after metabolic perturbations  <cit> . these studies build a picture of the divergent responses of the nucleolar composition to different treatments. the change in the nucleolar proteome in senescence reported here is different from each of the published studies, indicating that different treatments are interpreted by mammalian cells differently, and can induce specific biochemical responses in the nucleoli. for example, the redistribution of b <dig> from the nucleolus, observed in this study and other studies as well  <cit> , was not observed in etoposide treatment  <cit>  regardless of the p <dig> background of the cells studied  <cit> . this suggests that the b <dig> re-localization may be a reflection of a certain subset of growth inhibition, including senescence, and it is important to consider the global changes of nuclear proteins, instead of just one or two marker proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study describes for the first time the global change in the nucleolar proteome in response to induced senescence in mammalian cells. it provides the foundation on which future work on the role of nucleoli and nuclear organization in senescence can be built. in particular, the combined redistribution of b <dig> and chromatin in the nucleus found in all three in vitro models of senescence used in this study suggests a possible morphological signature of senescence. the functional significance of this redistribution of nucleolar protein will be a subject of future investigation.
