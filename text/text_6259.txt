BACKGROUND
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  are a leading cause of neonatal, pre-weaning and post-weaning diarrhoea  in pigs. significant economic losses are incurred as a result of mortalities, reduced growth rates in survivors and medication costs. antimicrobials have been used to treat infections but the emergence of multiple drug resistant variants poses a serious challenge in controlling etec infections in swine production. dietary zinc supplements, phage therapy, probiotics, antibody dietary formulations and breeding programs to generate swine stock expressing gut epithelial receptors that are not recognised by etec fimbriae all represent alternate strategies used by swine producers to control etec  <cit> , however these pathogens continue to pose a constant threat to farms.

etec serogroups o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> are implicated in diarrhoeal disease during pig development  <cit> . porcine enterotoxigenic e. coli o <dig> are associated with disease of the small intestine and mediate neonatal, pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea in piglets. this is in contrast to the mode of pathogenesis displayed by ehec o <dig>  which is associated with food-borne human illness causing diarrhoea and enterohaemorrhagic disease of the large intestine  <cit> . multiple evolutionary lineages of e. coli o <dig>  <cit>  with different lineages encoding variants of the h-antigen genes, and two distinct rfbe alleles within the o157-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster, have been described. in addition, reports of serogroup o <dig> isolates as etec  <cit>  and epec  <cit>  is indicative of a wider evolutionary range of pathogenic e. coli o <dig>  sourced from multiple hosts including humans, pigs and cattle.

features separating porcine etec from other diarrhoeagenic e. coli include the presence of the pig-specific fimbrial adhesins f <dig> , f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> that facilitate adherence to porcine gut epithelium and toxins including the heat-stable enterotoxins sta and stb, and a heat-labile enterotoxin  that induce diarrhoea  <cit> . molecular epidemiological studies indicate that other putative virulence genes are also expressed by etec causing nd and pwd, including east <dig> toxin, haemolysins, autotransporters, outer membrane proteins, siderophores and additional iron acquisition factors  <cit> . many putative virulence genes are present only in subsets of clinical etec isolates suggesting that different virulence gene combinations may contribute to the range of clinical symptoms observed in etec infections. additionally, etec readily acquire virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes by lateral gene transfer and strain variants containing new combinations of virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes are continually evolving globally  <cit> .

in  <dig> a piggery in australia sustained major economic losses from an outbreak of pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  with an o <dig> serogroup. a representative of the etec outbreak is isolate e. coli o <dig> svetec. e. coli o <dig> svetec caused pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea in pigs between 7– <dig> days of age, affecting farrowing as well as weaner sheds. severely affected pigs died suddenly with little or no diarrhoea. gilts were shown to shed the pathogen but remained free of symptoms during the outbreak. various antimicrobial and management strategies were implemented and all failed to control the etec infection in the pig herd. the outbreak resulted in a significant loss of piglets, over a long duration of time and over multiple sheds. eventually all stock were removed, pens cleaned and restocked. we present here a comparative genomic analyses of o <dig> svetec with a historical etec o <dig> isolate from australia  sampled in the 1990s from a clinical neonatal diarrhoea specimen  <cit> .

in this study, a combination of bioinformatics and genome sequencing methodologies was used to perform a comparative and phylogenetic analysis of strains o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  these are the first etec o <dig> genomes deposited in public databases. our analyses provide insight into the evolution of etec o <dig> isolates in australian swine populations revealing that they are phylogenetically distinct to other e. coli isolates of serogroup o <dig>  we identified a suite of putative virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in the two porcine o <dig> isolates. in addition, we highlight novel variability between these two related pathogens.

methods
strains, isolation, culture conditions and serogrouping
isolate o <dig> svetec  was isolated in  <dig> from the faeces of an affected piglet from a commercial farm in new south wales  that experienced repeated bouts of pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea and high mortality. isolate o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  was sampled in the 1990s from a clinical submission of common neonatal diarrhoea. isolates were initially characterised at the nsw department of primary industries elizabeth macarthur agricultural institute  in menangle  <cit> . the strains were sent to the ithree institute at the university of technology sydney , as stab cultures and thereafter regularly cultured in lb broth supplemented with ampicillin  with shaking at 200 rpm at 37°c for approximately 16 hours.

antimicrobial resistance phenotyping
at emai, strains were screened against  <dig> antimicrobial agents by disc diffusion using the calibrated dichotomous susceptibility  test australia, as reported previously  <cit> . the following antimicrobials were tested: ampicillin , amoxicillin/clavulanate , ticarcillin/clavulanic acid , cefalexin , cefoxitin , cefotaxime , cefepime , nalidixic acid , ciprofloxacin , imipenem , sulphafurazole , trimethoprim , tetracycline , apramycin , neomycin , gentamicin , azithromycin  and chloramphenicol .

genomic dna extraction
sequencing quality gdna was extracted from 2 ml of each overnight culture using a dneasy blood and tissue kit  following manufacturer’s recommendations.

whole genome sequencing, assembly, annotation and phylogenetic analysis
sequencing was performed at the uts in-house next generation sequencing facility using a bench top illumina miseq® sequencer and miseq® v <dig> chemistry. sequencing libraries were prepared with  <dig>  ng of gdna following the manufacturer’s protocol for the nextera® xt library preparation kit . sequencing with the miseq® sequencer generated  <dig> nucleotide  long paired end reads of the libraries representing each sample. the quality of the sequence reads was assessed using a locally downloaded version  of fastqc  software and assembled using the a5-miseq de novo assembly pipeline  <cit>  revised to process reads up to 500 nt long  <cit> . scaffolds over 1000 nt in length were included in the whole genome sequence analysis. whole genome shotgun sequences were deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession numbers jppp <dig> for e. coli o <dig> svetec and jpqx <dig> for e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  a preliminary annotation of each genome was generated using the automated annotation software rast  <cit>  and the annotation of antimicrobial resistance genes was performed using the resistance gene identifier  version  <dig> on the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database website  <cit> . individual genes of interest, including those annotated by rast and the rgi, were manually interrogated using ncbi’s blastn and blastp tools. insertion sequences  and open reading frames  were identified using the online tools is finder  and orf finder  respectively. phage associated gene clusters within the genomic scaffolds were initially identified using the phast  <cit>  server. genomic scaffolds with positive phast hits were further verified to be phage-associated in the rast annotation output and using blastn and blastp analysis.

an alignment of phylogenetic marker genes was constructed using phylosift  <cit>  and a tree was then inferred using fasttree <dig>  <cit> . the publicly available fasttree <dig> software is unable to resolve branches in the phylogeny shorter than 1×10− <dig> substitutions per site. our dataset appeared to have several short branches; therefore we modified the fasttree <dig> software to improve short branch resolution and applied it to our dataset. the output was visualised in figtree v <dig> . <dig> . the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genomes were analysed alongside  <dig> complete e. coli genomes,  <dig> complete shigella spp. genomes,  <dig> draft e. coli o <dig> genomes and  <dig> draft e. coli apec o <dig> genomes from the ncbi genbank database. the klebsiella pneumonia  <dig> and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar heidelberg str.  <dig> genome sequences were included in this analysis as out-groups to confirm the validity of the method; however these sequences were removed from the final phylogenetic tree to facilitate visualizing the fine-scale relationships among e. coli.

comparative genomic and mlst analysis
comparative genomics used tools available in mauve version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the mauve move contigs tool was used to tile scaffolds generated by the de novo a5-miseq assembler against the reference e. coli apec o <dig> finished genome. from this, the best alignment was chosen based on the highest weight score, an indicator of whether the predicted rearrangement exists, and lowest number of locally collinear blocks . scaffolds that tiled against the finished apec o <dig> genome were sorted and identified in this study as the subset representing the ‘core’ genome. the subset of scaffolds that did not align against the finished apec o <dig> genome were designated the ‘accessory’ genome. the progressivemauve module was used for comparative analysis of the genomes and to generate the figure. regions of interest identified from whole genome comparisons were further analysed using iterative blastn and blastp searches.

the pubmlst  database was used to identify the sequence type of the isolates using the achtman e. coli mlst scheme  <cit>  .

RESULTS
whole genome sequence statistics and phylogenetics
de-novo assembly of the o <dig> svetec genome generated  <dig> scaffolds with 60-fold coverage and a predicted genome size of 5547789 nt. the n <dig> value for the assembly was 96352 nt. for o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  de-novo assembly generated  <dig> scaffolds with 78-fold coverage, a predicted genome size of 5449663 nt and an n <dig> value of 91578 nt. in both cases, 50% of the respective genomes were assembled into the largest  <dig> scaffolds. scaffolds were sorted into cohorts putatively representing the core and accessory genomes of o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> using the criteria described above. the o <dig> svetec core genome consisted of  <dig> scaffolds totalling 4789945 nt while the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> core genome comprised  <dig> scaffolds totalling 4809185 nt. the accessory genome of o <dig> svetec was 738983 nt in length and was represented in  <dig> scaffolds while the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> accessory sequence totalled 616231 nt in  <dig> scaffolds.

phylogenetic analysis using the assembled genome sequences was performed to gain insight into the evolution of etec o <dig> isolates in australian swine populations. in-silico identification of the genes used in the updated clermont et al. phylotyping method  <cit>  determined that o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> belonged to phylogroup c. this concurred with previously reported data  <cit> .

the phylosift phylogenetic analysis was performed to examine the swine isolates in the context of e. coli population structure. figure  <dig> shows that neither e. coli o <dig> svetec nor e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> clustered with the other e. coli serogroup o <dig> isolates and grouped together into a single clade with the most closely related completely closed reference genome being an avian pathogenic e. coli  of serogroup o <dig> . notably, the subclade included a variety of other isolates including s. sonnei 53g , known pathogenic e. coli serogroups such as o <dig> , o <dig>  and o <dig>  and a draft e. coli o157:h <dig> genome sequence . e. coli o <dig> draft and complete genomes as well as e. coli o <dig> genomes grouped together as a large clade in the tree, clustering with a confidence value of  <dig>  the findings of our phylogenetic analysis were supported by emlst analysis in which the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> isolates represented a novel sequence type, st <dig>  <cit> . for comparative purposes, we also sequence typed apec o <dig>  the closest neighbour of the porcine o <dig> isolates and found it to be st <dig>  a member of the same clonal complex.figure  <dig>

comparative genomics
the scaffolds representing the core o <dig> svetec genome had  <dig>  predicted orfs while the scaffolds representing the core o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genome consisted of  <dig>  predicted orfs. both genomes displayed  <dig> rna-encoding orfs. a blastn comparison, facilitated by mauve, of the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genomes was performed on the scaffolds representing the core genomes of both etec o <dig> against the finished reference genome of e. coli apec o <dig> . common features between the two etec o <dig> core genomes included an enterotoxin-encoding scaffold and the transposon tn <dig>  which were not present within the reference genome. scaffolds carrying genes encoding enterotoxins lt and stb aligned to core genome sequences of both strains, likely due to an is <dig> gene aligning each scaffold to the same is element in the apec o <dig> genome sequence. blastn analysis of the lt/stb enterotoxin encoding scaffolds indicated similarity with pumnk88_ent  with both scaffolds exhibiting 99% sequence identity over 77% of the query sequence for o <dig> svetec and 79% for o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  these data suggest that the enterotoxin genes reside on a plasmid. variability between the core o <dig> genomes was mostly limited to phage associated regions scattered throughout each genome alignment. six phage-associated regions, designated phage regions s1-s <dig>  were identified within the o <dig> svetec core genome and seven, designated phage regions k1-k <dig> were identified in the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> core genome . two of the six phage regions in the o <dig> svetec genome were identified to be intact prophages by phast whereas five of the seven o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> phage regions were identified as intact prophages. the majority of these phage associated scaffolds were putatively composed of >85% phage and hypothetical gene content. phage region  <dig> of o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> was most similar to a lambda phage and encoded the increased serum survival gene bor. two identical phage-associated regions were shared by both o <dig> genomes. phage region  <dig> of o <dig> svetec and phage region  <dig> of o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> were identical over  <dig>  kb. phage region  <dig> of o <dig> svetec was 99% identical to phage region  <dig> of o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  two smaller regions in o <dig> svetec and one in o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> were manually identified as phage associated regions and are represented by unlabelled boxes in figure  <dig>  in addition, the scaffold encoding the k <dig> adhesin operon in the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genome also encoded several phage-associated genes that were lacking in the homologous o <dig> svetec scaffold. as such, this scaffold was aligned into the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> core genome due to these phage-associated genes. variation between all three genome sequences was also observed around the apec o <dig> o-antigen biosynthesis genes.table  <dig>

the accessory genome scaffolds of o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> were examined for orfs. o <dig> svetec comprises  <dig> predicted orfs over  <dig> scaffolds including  <dig> rna predictions, whereas o157:k <dig> 734/3’s comprises  <dig> predicted orfs over  <dig> scaffolds including  <dig> rna predictions. to further assess variability between the two genomes a comparative blastp analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the accessory genome orfs of o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> was performed . several scaffolds and consequently their predicted peptide sequences were determined to be unique to o <dig> svetec. the majority of genes common between the accessory genomes were plasmid related and included tra operon genes associated with incf and inci plasmids, and hypothetical proteins. fragments of complex antimicrobial resistance loci  were also shared between the two accessory genomes including a tn21-like mercury resistance operon and scaffolds associated with clinical class  <dig> and class  <dig> integrons. several phage-containing or phage gene-associated scaffolds were also identified within the accessory genomes. two approximately identical scaffolds of 29133 nt and 29044 nt respectively for o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> were identified as most similar to enterobacteria phage p <dig>  but were predicted to be incomplete by phast. both accessory genomes encoded plasmid transfer genes relating to the plasmid incompatibility groups f and i, however the o <dig> svetec accessory scaffolds also encoded inch plasmid-associated genes. blastn analysis of the 66 kb  encoding inch <dig> plasmid-associated genes identified seven genbank entries each with 96-99% query coverage and 98-99% identity with the scaffold. each entry was of a plasmid and included serratia marcescens plasmid r <dig> , salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar cubana str. cfsan <dig> plasmid  and escherichia coli apec o <dig> plasmid papec-o1-r . several other scaffolds within the o <dig> svetec accessory genome also aligned with high identity to these plasmids. these scaffold generally encoded hypothetical proteins with the exception of a copper/heavy metal  resistance operon  and a tellurium/tellurite  resistance operon .

the o <dig> svetec accessory genome was also characterised by the presence of a tn7-like transposon operon, hygromycin resistance, the enterotoxin sta and a second allele of stb, all of which were lacking in the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> accessory genome. a  <dig>  kb region of another accessory o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> scaffold was identified to contain an incomplete phage most similar to enterobacteria phage p <dig> . further blastn analysis suggested both etec o <dig> genomes contained only a single copy of the p1-like phage, which has been split amongst various core and accessory scaffolds due to the reference tiling. aside from these specifics, much of the variation between the accessory genomes of the two strains lies in plasmid associated hypothetical proteins, mobile elements and crl-associated scaffolds.

the o-antigen biosynthesis genes within both etec o <dig> draft genome sequences were split across several scaffolds making detailed analysis difficult. despite this, high synteny was observed between the o157-antigen encoding scaffolds with both isolates encoding the sakai-type rfbe gene  and also containing the genes yoeb and yefm identical to the e. coli strain pv00- <dig> o-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster  <cit> .

virulence factors
as both the etec o <dig> pathogens belong to the novel st <dig> sequence type we were particularly interested to identify potential virulence determinants within their genomes. those we identified through sequence analysis are detailed in table  <dig>  including a variety of adhesin and toxin genes and their associated operons. both o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> were positive for the enterotoxins ltp  and stb  whereas the heat stable enterotoxin sta  was only identified in o <dig> svetec. a further distinction highlighted by sequence analysis was that a second allele of estb was present in a separate scaffold within the o <dig> svetec genome. this allele differed by a single nucleotide polymorphism and was identical to the stb gene of escherichia coli f18+ strain ec <dig> plasmid ptc <dig> . the flic gene was, in both isolates, the h <dig> allele.table  <dig>

antimicrobial resistances
multiple antibiotic resistances were observed in the phenotypic analysis of o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  both isolates were resistant to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, sulphafurazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline and neomycin. each isolate displayed distinct additional resistance phenotypes against apramycin and chloramphenicol for o <dig> svetec and against cephalexin and cefoxitin for the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> isolate  <cit> . various genes known to provide these antimicrobial resistances were identified within the genome sequences . the gyra sequence of both isolates was determined to contain a single s83l amino acid change compared with the e. coli k <dig> substrain mg <dig> gyra gene.table  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we were able to characterise the evolutionary background of two non-ehec e. coli o <dig> strains, and identify genetic differences between these two etec strains known to adopt different pathogenic strategies; e. coli o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> associated with neonatal diarrhoea and e. coli o <dig> svetec associated with severe pre- and post-weaning disease. our analysis demonstrated an evolutionary contrast between etec o <dig> and ehec o <dig> and identified various small differences in toxin and antimicrobial resistance gene content between the two etec o <dig> isolates.

molecular evolution of etec o <dig> strains
the phylosift analysis demonstrated that the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> etec isolates are most closely related to an apec o <dig> isolate. this is interesting because previous work on apec o <dig> isolates has reported such isolates to be closely related to human etec isolates  <cit> . phlyosift analysis also demonstrated a degree of relatedness between the etec o <dig> isolates, e. coli w and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli o111:h−. these results highlight the similarity of various e. coli pathotypes and serogroups when observed from a genomic perspective. in doing so these results further stress that clonal ancestry can play a minor role in predicting pathogenesis compared with the lateral acquisition of virulence factors. the phylosift analysis, which utilised the dna sequences of  <dig> conserved marker genes, also demonstrated a contrast between the genetic relatedness of most e. coli o157:h <dig> genomes from the genbank database and our etec o157:h <dig> genomes. two o <dig> genomes proved exceptions to this observation; e. coli o157:h <dig> str. t <dig> from hungary  <cit>  and o157:h <dig> str. nccp <dig> from korea . clustering of e. coli o157:h <dig> isolates and the divergence of non-h <dig> strains in the phylogenetic analysis supports the idea that h-antigen typing may be a useful indicator of e. coli o <dig> lineage. in addition, the atypical  o157:h <dig> str. t <dig> encode cdt and long polar fimbriae  <cit> , which underscores how o <dig> isolates carrying different h-antigens may carry different repertoires of virulence genes.

observations of e. coli relatedness similar to these have been made previously in relation to the parallel evolution of ehec pathogenesis within the distantly related serogroups such as o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig>  <cit> , where pathogenesis was mediated by similar laterally acquired elements such as plasmids and prophages. this phylogenetic divergence also suggests genetic recombination played a role in etec o <dig> development, with the etec o <dig> isolates encoding the “sakai-type” o <dig> o-antigen biosynthesis gene cluster  <cit> . the acquisition of this biosynthesis gene cluster is an event known to have also shaped the evolution of enterohaemorrhagic e. coli o <dig>  <cit> .

multi-locus sequence typing analysis of the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genomes supported their close evolutionary relationship to each other and to the st <dig> complex which includes apec o <dig>  in the mlst database e. coli st <dig> isolates have been sourced from avian, porcine, human and bovine hosts. enterotoxigenic e. coli o <dig> strains of porcine origin from different geographic locations have been submitted to the mlst database as st <dig>  although we could find little mention or analysis of these strains in the literature.

comparison of etec o <dig> core and accessory genomes
analysis of scaffolds representing the core genome from o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> highlighted the close relationship of these strains. genetic differences were largely associated with the acquisition of prophage-associated sequences. some prophages were common between the two isolates suggesting they may have been acquired prior to an evolutionary divergence. one phage in o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> contained the bor gene which is known to be associated with increased serum survival. the bor gene has a lambda phage origin and is generally associated with avian extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  <cit> .

the variability of the accessory genomes for each isolate is mediated mostly by plasmid sequences, particularly inch <dig> plasmid genes and heavy metal resistance operons, indicating that the differences in pathogenesis between these two isolates is essentially associated with plasmid content. attempts to purify plasmids from our isolates using various plasmid extraction kits and standard alkaline lysis methods were unsuccessful. it is possible that the plasmids are extremely large, beyond the capability of the extraction methods used, or they are embedded in the chromosomes of these isolates. we were unable to confirm the presence of genomic islands in our analysis because of the reference genome based tiling exercise employed to separate the subset of scaffolds potentially encoding the core genome and accessory genomes. large mass plasmids encoding resistance to multiple antibiotics in e. coli isolated from the faeces of food animals in australia have been described  <cit>  and as such may play a role in the pathogenesis of these isolates. heavy metals are used frequently in pig production as antimicrobials and the identification of copper and mercury resistance loci in both strains and tellurium resistance in o <dig> svetec are likely provide significant survival advantages to these isolates. antimicrobial resistance genes, discussed below, provide further advantages to these isolates. such genes are often found on plasmids carrying mercury resistance transposons that serve as conduits for the lateral transfer of such genes  <cit> .

virulence factors
e. coli virulence factors that are routinely screened for globally  <cit>  were identified in the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genomes. these included the porcine etec specific k <dig> fimbrial adhesin, and several adhesins commonly seen in other pathotypes of e. coli. the fimh gene, which encodes a mannose-specific adhesin in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli  <cit>  has also been observed in commensal e. coli isolates or porcine origin  <cit> . blast analysis identified various adhesins, however most of these are common to e. coli isolates and have no definitive role in pathogenicity. the primary difference between the virulence profiles of the o <dig> svetec strain and the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> strain is that the latter lacks the heat-stable enterotoxin a  and a second copy of stb. links between the enterotoxins present in an isolate and the form of pathogenesis caused by etec have been described previously  <cit>  and these differences may impact pathogenesis. previous work has also shown that the ptc plasmid-like variant of stb, which is homologous to the extra stb allele encoded in o <dig> svetec, is not enterotoxigenic in vivo  <cit> .

other virulence associated genes identified in the o <dig> svetec and the o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> genomes included the flagellin structural protein flic. the presence of the flic gene, which encodes the h <dig> flagellar antigen  <cit> , is important. previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the expression of flagellum and the k88ac fimbrial antigen  <cit>  where the expression of both flic and faeg, the major subunit of the k <dig> adhesin, correlates with adhesion to porcine epithelial cells in vitro. the characterisation of the flagellum also allows us to identify the serotype of both isolates as e. coli o157:h19:k <dig>  pathogenic e. coli of the serotype o157:h <dig> have been very sparingly reported  <cit>  and studies involving isolates of this serotype have focussed on triclosan tolerance  <cit> . these studies do indicate that o <dig> strains have a capacity to adapt to multiple pathogenic lifestyles, having been identified as verocytotoxigenic, enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic e. coli.

another factor that appears to influence etec pathogenicity is the host’s intestinal development and environment. environmental conditions have an impact on enteroheamorrhagic e. coli pathogenesis and the regulation of virulence factor expression  <cit> . a similar situation has been observed in vitro for etec, with lt expression modified by ph  <cit> . also, it has been demonstrated that the porcine intestinal epithelium can develop a resistance to f18-mediated adherence  <cit>  and the stress of early weaning reduces the ability of piglets to cope with etec infection  <cit> . this data indicates that whilst it is important to characterise pathogenic e. coli, host characteristics and the intestinal environment may play a role in altering pathogenicity and account for the variation in disease severity between these isolates given their highly similar virulence factor content.

antibiotic resistance
the greatest disparity between the o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> isolates is their antibiotic resistance. both have quite comprehensive resistance profiles being resistant to beta-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides and cephalosporins. in context, one of the most important antimicrobial resistance genes in either strain is apha <dig> which confers resistance to neomycin and kanamycin, with neomycin being a drug of choice for the treatment of infection during pig development within australian pig farms. the majority of the observed resistance phenotypes have been accounted for including a known nalidixic acid resistance mutation in the dna gyrase gene gyra. large complex antimicrobial gene resistance loci centred around both class  <dig> and class  <dig> integrons were identified within these genome sequences, however the prevalence of the insertion sequence is <dig> in these regions precluded the automated assembly of the loci.

CONCLUSIONS
o <dig> svetec and o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig> appear to be part of a poorly characterised lineage of e. coli o <dig>  which differs significantly from ehec o <dig>  differences in pathogenicity between the strains may stem from differences in acquired virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance, and phage related genes  with e. coli o <dig> svetec encoding a larger toxin repertoire compared to o157:k <dig> 734/ <dig>  further studies with these strains will focus on the assembly of antibiotic resistance gene loci and their association with mobile genetic elements.
