BACKGROUND
a major goal in evolutionary biology is to understand the processes that generate new species. until recently, genetic analyses of species differences have relied on a small number of model systems. here we examine patterns of divergence among relatives of the moss physcomitrella patens  bruch & schimp., the first bryophyte with completely sequenced and well-annotated nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . p. patens belongs to the funariaceae, a family of small, terricolous mosses with highly diverse sporophyte morphology. in contrast to other funariaceae, physcomitrella is characterized by a short sporophyte lacking many of the ornamentations typical in mosses. the history of the genus was reviewed by tan  <cit> . the index muscorum  <cit>  listed four species in the genus physcomitrella. of the four taxa, physcomitrella austro-patens broth. and p. californica h.a. crum and l.e. anderson were treated later as synonyms of p. readeri  i.g. stone & g.a.m. scott. physcomitrella hampei limpr. was interpreted as a hybrid species  <cit> . however, based on variable but overlapping phenotypic characteristics, a revised classification of the genus physcomitrella was subsequently proposed by tan  <cit> , which described physcomitrella as one single polymorphic species with four subspecies, namely p. patens ssp. patens from europe, p. patens ssp. readeri  b.c. tan from australia, p. patens ssp. californica  b.c. tan from california  and japan, and p. patens ssp. magdalenae  b.c. tan from rwanda . currently, the majority of bryologists accept three separate species, namely physcomitrella patens, p. readeri and p. magdalenae de sloover. p. patens has a wide distribution in the northern hemisphere, p. readeri is found in california , australia and japan  <cit> , while p. magdalenae has been reported from rwanda, africa  <cit> . recent data suggest that the physcomitrella phenotype arose three times within the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex, based on phylogenetic analyses of nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial dna sequence data  <cit> . here, the species complex is defined as a taxonomic group of intergraded phenotypes that hinders separation based on morphological traits. due to the fact that physcomitrella has been classified as a single species based on similar morphological characters of the sporophytes, it has been argued that such characters should not be used for classification  <cit> . in order to test the polyphyletic origin of the genus physcomitrella and to analyze whether monophyletic groups corresponding to species can be resolved within physcomitrella, we performed phylogenetic analyses of a nuclear single copy gene   <cit>  and microsatellite simple sequence repeat  data amplified from numerous accessions covering all four physcomitrella subspecies and further funariaceae.

regarding the sequenced p. patens strain from gransden , the haploid chromosome number of n =  <dig> for meiotic and mitotic cells  <cit>  provides evidence for a complex history of polyploidization, since the base number of chromosomes is reported to be n = 4– <dig> among mosses  <cit> . genome duplication or polyploidization is an important mechanism of eukaryotic evolution  <cit>  and considered to be of particular relevance in the speciation and diversification of land plants. molecular data have confirmed that p. patens is a paleopolyploid that underwent at least one whole-genome duplication event approximately  <dig> mya during the eocene  <cit> . however, some other funariaceae from within the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex have even higher chromosome numbers ranging, e.g., from n =  <dig> to n =  <dig> for physcomitrium pyriforme, or n =  <dig> to n =  <dig> for physcomitrium eurystomum <cit> . taking this into account, along with the fact that some funariaceae show interfertility  <cit> , a considerable number of polyploids, including allopolyploid hybrid species, can be expected. natural hybrids among the funariaceae, typically characterized by intermediate sporophytic characteristics  <cit> , have also been described from the field  <cit> . the putative hybrid origin of physcomitrium collenchymatum and p. eurystomum was recently been suggested based on molecular data and genealogical analyses of six different loci, including ribosomal, plastidic, and nuclear marker genes  <cit> . however, scarce evidence for polyploidization-derived paralogs  of single copy genes in the analyzed physcomitrium species has been shown to date.

in this study, we analyzed genome sizes and homeologs of the nuclear single copy gene brk <dig> <cit>  across a broad range of funariaceae accessions in order to test whether species belonging to the genus physcomitrium are allopolyploid hybrids. we chose brk <dig> as a phylogenetic marker gene as it is a single copy gene in nearly all of the land plant genomes sequenced to date . in addition, we assessed the requirement of rna editing sites to be edited, since out of  <dig> p. patens editing sites   <cit>  three are not present in funaria hygrometrica <cit> , thus rendering the pattern of editing site gain and loss a potentially informative evolutionary feature within the funariaceae. based on phylogenetic analysis of the novel marker gene brk <dig>  microsatellite-derived genetic distances and different editing patterns, we have revised the physcomitrella subspecies sensu tan  <cit>  and hypothesize on speciation and the mode of spore dispersal in physcomitrella.

methods
funariaceae in vitro collection, culture and observation
numerous funariaceae accessions  were contributed to the authors  and established in axenic in vitro culture as previously described  <cit> . all plants originated from recent isolates except the p. patens accession from gransden  which derives from a single spore isolated by h.l.k. whitehouse in  <dig>  <cit> . information about locality, habitat, collectors, year of collection, international moss stock center  numbers and vouchers, as well as molecular, morphological and flow cytometric data are available for selected species from that collection . plants from two capsules collected at the same location were denoted with a “k” and the capsule number. at present, the in vitro collection comprises  <dig> funariaceae accessions from different worldwide locations . these accessions were assigned to taxa according to the species classification of the collectors and encompass  <dig> physcomitrella,  <dig> physcomitrium, three funaria and one aphanorrhegma accession. the physcomitrella accessions comprise plants from regions where the four different subspecies were originally found  <cit> . p. patens ssp. patens is represented by  <dig> accessions from different regions of europe and one accession from north america. p. patens ssp. californica accessions are available from north america and japan, one from the southern island kyushu and two from the central island honshu. p. patens ssp. magdalenae was collected in rwanda, africa. one accession of p. patens ssp. readeri is available from the melton reservoir in australia. in addition to that, aphanorrhegma serratum and three funaria species from north america are represented in the collection. concerning physcomitrium, three p. sphaericum accessions, three p. eurystomum accessions, seven p. pyriforme accessions from europe and north america and one p. collenchymatum accession from north america are also available .

physcomitrella subspecies 
several funariaceae were contributed to the authors and established in axenic in vitro culture. the name of each species, locality, region and collector are listed for each accession. for physcomitrella, the revised taxon name according to the new classification proposed here is listed on the left, while the former name of the subspecies as described by the collector is listed on the right. for further information, e.g. year of collection, habitat and available data  see additional file 2: table s <dig> 

plants were cultivated on solid mineral knop medium  <cit>  as previously described  <cit> . for standardized observation of gametophytic features, plants were grown on petri dishes  wrapped with laboratory film. environmental conditions were set to  <dig> degrees celsius and a long day  light cycle . plants were established by transfer of individual gametophores, and observed under a stereo binocular  after several weeks to months of growth.

genomic dna extraction
genomic dna was extracted from moss tissue following the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide  method described by  <cit> . up to 100 mg of moss material was disrupted with a tissue lyser  and incubated for 30 min in 700 μl ctab buffer . subsequently, 600 μl chloroform:isoamylalcohol  was added. phase separation was reached after vigorous mixing by centrifugation  for 5 min. the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and 2/ <dig>  isopropanol was added for precipitation at - <dig> °c overnight. the dna was sedimented by centrifugation  for 30–45 min at  <dig> °c. the supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed twice with 200 μl of  <dig> % ethanol. after centrifugation , the supernatant was removed. dna was dissolved in 100 μl te buffer . for rnase digestion, 10 μg rnase a  were added and the dna was incubated for 1 h at  <dig> °c. rnase digestion was controlled and dna concentration was determined by gel electrophoresis in  <dig> % agarose gels.

amplification of brk <dig> from genomic dna
a part of the nuclear gene brk <dig>  was amplified using the primers brick1_for: gtcggcattgctgtacaa and brick1_rev: ctccagctgacgctccag. the pcr was performed in 20 μl reaction volume containing 2 μl 10 × buffer e ,  <dig>  μl deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates ,  <dig>  u taq polymerase ,  <dig>  μl of each primer  and 1 μl genomic dna . the pcr cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at  <dig> °c for 5 min, followed by cycling conditions which consisted of a denaturation step of 45 s at  <dig> °c, annealing at  <dig> °c for 1 min and elongation at  <dig> °c for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles. the pcr products were eluted and purified from a  <dig> % agarose gel with the qiaquick gel extraction kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

cloning of brk <dig> and plasmid dna extraction
the pcr sequencing products of p. eurystomum, p. collenchymatum and p. pyriforme showed overlapping sequence peaks  in the electropherogram . in order to obtain clear sequences for potentially multiple loci of brk <dig> for these species, the pcr products were cloned into the blunt end vector pjet <dig> /blunt according to the manufacturer’s protocol . the vector was transformed into e. coli cells, which were incubated overnight on solid ampicillin-containing lb medium at  <dig> °c for selection. bacterial colonies were screened for the insertion of plasmid dna via pcr using the pjet <dig> /blunt primers pjet_t7_for: taatacgactcactataggg and pjet_rev: gaagaacatcgattttccatggcagc. plasmid dna extraction was performed after an overnight incubation in ampicillin-containing liquid lb medium at  <dig> °c using the genejet™ plasmid miniprep-kit .

direct sequencing of brk <dig> pcr products and of plasmid clones
in total, 10–50 ng/μl of the purified pcr product were sent for sequencing to gatc biotech ag  using the primers brick1_for and brick1_rev. plasmid dna was sent in concentrations of 30–100 ng/μl and sanger sequenced  with a standard sequencing primer for the blunt end vector pjet <dig> /blunt . for accessions with polymorphic direct pcr sequencing products, up to  <dig> plasmid dnas from independent clones were sent for sequencing, respectively. sequences which were obtained at least twice independently were considered true and used for phylogenetic analyses. exceptions to this were both sequences of brk <dig> for one p. pyriforme accession , and one sequence representing one locus of p. collenchymatum  which were each obtained only once. these sequences were included into further analyses since they were found to be identical to corresponding sequences of other accessions from the same species.

brk <dig> sequence analysis
the sequence chromatograms were analyzed with the chromaspro software, version  <dig>  . multiple sequence alignments were calculated with muscle  <dig>   <cit>  and visualized with jalview  <cit> . the gene structure of brk <dig> was annotated within the multiple sequence alignment according to the gene structure found in p. patens . neighbor-joining analysis was performed with quicktree_sd  <cit>  using  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. bayesian inference was carried out with mrbayes  <cit> , using the gtr model with eight gamma distributed rates, invariant sites, two hot and two cold chains, burn-in  <dig> and two million generations, until the standard deviation of split frequencies dropped below  <dig> . maximum likelihood inference was carried out with tree-puzzle  <cit>  using the gtr model with eight gamma-distributed rates, quartet puzzling  and exact parameter estimation. while the maximum likelihood tree is shown, support values from all three methods are plotted on the tree . the tree was visualized with figtree v <dig> . <dig> .

rna editing analysis
dna was prepared from plant material using the extraction method described by  <cit> . primer pairs bordering regions of nad <dig>  nad <dig>  nad <dig> , cox <dig> , rps <dig>  and ccmfc  harboring mitochondrial editing sites identified in the p. patens accession from gransden  <cit> , were used for pcr assays. amplification assays were performed as described  <cit> . pcr products were gel-purified using the hiyield pcr clean-up & gel-extraction kit  or purified using exosap-it  and sanger sequenced . dna sequences were aligned to the corresponding coding sequences of p. patens and funaria hygrometrica <cit>  using mega  <dig>   <cit>  and putative editing sites were identified via prepact  <dig>   <cit> .

amplification of est-derived microsatellites
genomic dna was extracted as previously described  <cit> . sixty-four simple sequence repeat  loci with available polymorphism information content  were chosen from a collection of est-derived microsatellites  <cit> . in total,  <dig> loci were found to be suitable by means of pcr, using the respective first primer pair listed; the ssr numbering in additional file 4: table s <dig> corresponds to the one in the above mentioned original data. ssr loci were amplified in a 20 μl pcr mix containing 2 μl of 10 × red-taq-pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp,  <dig> pmol each of two primers,  <dig>  u red-taq-polymerase  and 4 ng genomic dna. pcr was carried out starting with an initial dna denaturation at  <dig> °c for 2 min. the first cycle consisted of 30 s denaturation at  <dig> °c, with primer annealing for 30 s at  <dig> °c and elongation for 30 s at  <dig> °c. in each of the  <dig> subsequent cycles, the annealing temperature was decreased by  <dig>  °c. the final 25 cycles consisted of 15 s denaturation at  <dig> °c, 15 s primer annealing at  <dig> °c and 30 s elongation at  <dig> °c. ssr pcr products were size separated in  <dig> % metaphor  high resolution agarose by gel electrophoresis in  <dig>  fold tbe  and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

ssr data analysis
ssr loci were scored manually for all included accessions according to their amplified fragment size. distinguishable sizes were scored as different alleles; indistinguishable sizes were scored as the same allele . absence of pcr products was scored as a haploid null allele. the data set included all physcomitrella accessions as well as physcomitrium sphaericum . genetic distances were calculated with nei’s da distance algorithm  <cit> . the phylogenetic tree was constructed with the neighbor-joining algorithm  <cit>  using  <dig>  bootstrap replicates. for genetic distance and phylogenetic tree calculations the software population  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used and the tree was visualized using figtree . in addition, the different sized alleles derived from the  <dig> ssr loci were transformed into  <dig> binary presence/absence characters . the binary encoding might overestimate variation, but was necessary since splitstree does not allow presentation of the data in a continuous fashion. based on this matrix , splitstree  <dig>  <cit>  was used to calculate genecontent distances and a bootstrapped  neighbornet.

flow cytometry
gametophores, pre-cultured for four weeks, were chopped using a razor blade in buffer  containing 1 mg/l  <dig>  diamidino-2-phenylindol . the debris was filtered through a 40 μm sieve prior to measurement. the flow cytometric measurement was performed with a moflo high speed cell sorter . the nuclei were sorted on the basis of their forward and side scatter profiles as well as on their dapi signals. the scatter measurements were performed using excitation from an argon ion laser at 488 nm at 200 mw power, while the dapi signal came from excitation with an argon ion laser set up for multiline uv emission  at 80 mw. dapi emission was measured from  <dig> to 460 nm. as a reference to control for the relative intensities of the samples, 20 μl of dapi reference standard beads  were added to each sample. the dapi beads could be separated from the nuclei on the basis of their forward versus side scatter profiles. profiles were separated into dapi, 1n  and 2n  peaks. the 2n peak represents cells arrested at the g2/m transition  <cit> . values presented in table  <dig> are the averaged median of the 1n peak divided by the median of the peak for the dapi beads, i.e., haploid nuclear dna content normalized to dapi control beads. the ratio between the 1n and 2n peak was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  in all samples, supporting correct peak definition . p. patens from gransden served as an additional control for each experiment ; other accessions were measured up to four times if in doubt of measurement quality.

sequencing of brk <dig> transcripts from six selected funariaceae
total rna was extracted using the qiagen rneasy plant mini kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by on-column dnase digestion. the resulting rna samples from p. patens from gransden , three accessions from p. eurystomum  and two accessions from p. collenchymatum  were reverse transcribed using superscript iii . the reverse primer brk1_rev  was used for priming the first strand synthesis. the resulting cdna was then further amplified using both brk <dig> primers, brk1_for  and brk1_rev, and subsequently sanger sequenced . the primers used were selected based on multiple sequence alignment of clonal sequences.

quantitative real-time pcr and high-resolution-melting
total rna was extracted and cdna was synthesized as described above. cdna synthesis was verified by pcr. primers for quantitative real-time pcr  were designed to specifically amplify a 129 bp long fragment of the exon containing polymorphisms in p. collenchymatum . each qpcr was carried out using the sensimix hrm kit  on a lightcycler <dig>  with the following parameters:  <dig> °c for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles of  <dig> °c,  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, for 15 s each. high resolution melting analysis was subsequently carried out from  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c with a ramp rate of  <dig>  °c/s. melting curve data were analyzed using the gene scanning software  and a sensitivity setting of  <dig>  with auto-grouping. pre-melt and post-melt temperatures were chosen in the range of  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c respectively.

RESULTS
paralogs of the single copy gene brk <dig> and enlarged genome sizes provide evidence for allopolyploid hybrid physcomitrium species
in order to gain evidence for homeologs of the single copy gene brk <dig> we amplified this gene from selected funariaceae, including the genera aphanorrhegma, physcomitrella, physcomitrium and funaria . the sequence length amplified from genomic dna  was approximately  <dig> nucleotides, but varies between the analyzed species . in the pcr products, sequence polymorphisms were detected within all accessions of the species p. pyriforme, p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum, indicating multiple brk <dig> loci within these species. however, no sequence polymorphisms were detected in the aphanorrhegma, funaria and physcomitrella accessions . after cloning the respective pcr products, two distinct sequences were clearly distinguishable per physcomitrium species, respectively . these loci were compared to the polymorphic direct sequencing product in order to compare the sequence polymorphisms with both clonal sequences of brk <dig> . most differences between the homeologs occurred in the single intron, while in the case of p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum polymorphisms also occurred in the exons . phylogenetic analyses revealed two distinct clades of the homeologous brk <dig> for p. pyriforme, p. eurystomum and p. collenchymatum . since three of these clades  cluster with the p. patens  accession from africa , and two of the other three with p. patens from europe, they provide evidence for allopolyploidization rather than autopolyploidization.

brk <dig> 
overview of sequence polymorphisms in the direct pcr product of brk <dig> from different funariaceae. for each species multiple accessions are included. the number of sequence polymorphisms and gaps between two homeologs from the physcomitrium accessions is shown on the right. for details see additional file 3: figure s <dig> 

flow cytometric measurements were performed for all funariaceae for which the brk <dig> sequence was available, including multiple accessions of physcomitrella, p. pyriforme, p. eurystomum and p. collenchymatum . all accessions of physcomitrella show a comparable genome size as p. patens from gransden , whereas p. pyriforme, p. eurystomum and p. collenchymatum have a larger size , albeit p. collenchymatum not significantly . these higher amounts of dna, together with the brk <dig> homeologs, indicate that p. pyriforme, p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum are recent allopolyploids.

expression patterns of brk <dig> homeologs in physcomitrium species
in order to determine whether both loci of brk <dig> are expressed in p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum, rt-pcr and quantitative real-time pcr  were performed using primers that cover polymorphisms in the exon . the existence of both homeologs at the transcript level was confirmed via rt-pcr and subsequent sequencing of the transcripts . the expression pattern of the homeologs was determined with qpcr and the resulting amplicons were analyzed by high resolution melting  to distinguish the transcripts. p. patens from gransden  was used as a reference. both p. collenchymatum accessions show two distinct expressed transcripts of brk <dig>  whereas all three p. eurystomum and physcomitrella yielded only one product in this analysis . due to the almost identical melting patterns, the auto-grouping of the gene scanning software was not able to distinguish between the p. eurystomum accessions  with their single polymorphism at the exon level, while the two polymorphisms in the exon of p. collenchymatum  could be resolved. in summary, the exon polymorphisms of brk <dig> were confirmed at the transcript level by sequencing  and partly by hrm, demonstrating that both homeologs are expressed .

brk <dig> as a phylogenetic marker confirms polyphyletic origin of three physcomitrella species
based on the high conservation of brk <dig>  and on the fact that the encoding gene brk <dig> harbors an intron, we expected the nucleic acid sequence to represent a suitable phylogenetic marker to resolve relationships within the funariaceae. different methods of tree inference based on the nucleic acid sequences  all led to essentially the same topology, separating the funaria sequences from four well supported clades . the three clades representing physcomitrella from europe and north america , physcomitrella from australia and japan  and p. patens ssp. magdalenae from africa are distinct in the brk1-based phylogeny . this confirms a polyphyletic origin of these three lineages as previously proposed  <cit>  and supports that accessions of p. patens ssp. californica  actually belong to two different clades. moreover, a. serratum clusters in a clade together with p. patens ssp. patens and may therefore be considered to belong to the physcomitrium-physcomitrella complex as well.

genic microsatellites support high genetic distances within the genus physcomitrella
sixty-four est-derived simple sequence repeat  loci  <cit>  were analyzed, and all physcomitrella accessions  turned out to be of different genotypes as measured by ssrs. in total,  <dig> alleles were detected . the phylogenetic tree based on genetic distances  displays a separation of four major clades. one clearly ramified clade consists of european and north american accessions  with small genetic distances, a second clade is formed by the japanese and the australian accessions , while the african p. patens ssp. magdalenae is on a separate branch . the genetic distances of the four physcomitrella subspecies clusters to one another are as large as, or even larger than, the distance of p. sphaericum to each of them. large banding size shifts and null alleles obtained in the african and the japanese-australian clade point towards sequence changes surpassing the enclosed ssrs and affecting the flanking regions. visualization of the allele presence/absence data as a network  suggests either sexual recombination and thus long range genetic flow, or the parallel  evolution of alleles. there are only minor differences between the topologies of figures  <dig> and  <dig>  in summary, although some of the nodes are not well supported, the genetic distance data support three independently evolved  physcomitrella lineages in the same way as the brk <dig> data does.

the pattern of editing sites supports independent speciation of physcomitrella and hybridization of physcomitrium
requirement for rna editing at eight positions in the mitochondrial genome known to be edited in p. patens from gransden  was checked for a broad set of accessions across the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex . editing sites in nad <dig>  cox <dig> and ccmfc, which were conserved between f. hygrometrica and p. patens, as well as rps14eu137sl , absent from f. hygrometrica <cit> , were found to be conserved in all investigated species. in contrast, the requirement of editing at positions nad3- <dig> and nad4- <dig> varied. while all isolates of physcomitrella from europe and north america  showed editing at both positions, in accessions of physcomitrella from australia and japan  and p. patens ssp. magdalenae from africa a t was already encoded at the appropriate positions, making editing obsolete. this supports the independent speciation of at least two physcomitrella lineages, and the assignment of accessions of p. patens ssp. californica into different physcomitrella lineages.

clustering of a. serratum to the p. patens clade, as shown in the brk1-based phylogeny, was confirmed by the same editing requirements of a. serratum and p. patens ssp. patens in contrast to funaria . all p. pyriforme isolates showed a t at position nad3eu230sl and a c at position nad4eu272sl at the dna level , congruent with p. pyriforme being a hybrid species derived from divergent parental lines. the p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum, as well as the physcomitrium sphaericum editing sites nad3eu230sl and nad4eu272sl, are akin to the p. patens ssp. patens clade . the scenario of p. patens ssp. magdalenae developing from the same parental line as p. pyriforme and p. eurystomum is further supported by a site to be edited, ccmfceu52rc, exclusively identified in accessions of these three lineages. an additional putative editing site in nad <dig>  nad5eu446sl, is only shared by p. pyriforme and p. patens ssp. magdalenae.

in vitro comparison of gametophytic morphological features
since sporophytic features are not suitable for distinguishing physcomitrella species, we compared gametophytes grown under identical in vitro conditions. the californian accession  deviates from the european accessions  by developing much smaller gametophores with smaller leaflets . however, consistent with the european accessions, the leaflets of the californian accession develop a costa in most cases, albeit less pronounced and extending to only three quarters of the leaflets . in the japanese and the australian accessions the gametophores and leaflets  are much smaller, typically less than half the size as compared to p. patens from gransden , comparable to the californian accession . however, the leaflets do not develop a costa except in very rare cases where a costa may be present, reaching at most half the length of the leaflets . the leaflets of the african accession  are the largest among all analyzed accessions, with up to twice the surface of the european accessions . they are orbiculate and much broader than the lanceloate leaflets of the other accessions . in summary, leaflet shape and the presence of a costa might be useful to distinguish the physcomitrella accessions, while leaflet/gametophore size seemed rather variable. of course, this comparison was done only for single accessions from in vitro cultivated funariaceae and one can therefore expect more morphological variance in the field as well as from other accessions grown under in vitro conditions.

discussion
hybridization and polyploidization among the funariaceae
here we present data showing that convergent evolution and allopolyploidization are associated with the generation of new species in the funariaceae. interspecific hybridization among mosses is an underestimated evolutionary phenomenon  <cit> . both, artificial crossings  <cit>  and naturally occurring hybrids have previously been described for the funariaceae  <cit> .

previously,  <cit>  reported that physcomitrium collenchymatum and p. eurystomum are hybrid species, putatively produced from hybridizations between ancestors of modern p. sphaericum and p. pyriforme. this was based on the observation that these species contained specific polymorphisms  at four nuclear loci . however, each haploid individual generally contained either the sphaericum or pyriforme-like allele, but never both. this finding was consistent with either homoploid hybrid speciation, or allopolyploid speciation, followed by a loss of one homeolog at each of these loci . the one exception to this pattern was the ho <dig> locus where four european isolates of p. pyriforme contained two divergent copies of this locus.

here we found that p. eurystomum, p. collenchymatum, and five european isolates of p. pyriforme have genome sizes larger than those of their putative parent lineages, while they also contain two divergent paralogs of brk <dig>  for these data to be explained by a homoploid hybrid speciation event, we would have to assume both a massive expansion of transposable elements  <cit>  and parallel duplications of the brk <dig> locus. alternatively, these data might reflect an allopolyploidization event followed by the loss of one paralog at the adk, apr,  and papr loci, a process called fractionation. our current data do not allow to unambiguously rule out homoploid hybrid speciation, but the frequency of homeolog loss following polyploidy in a wide range of organisms  <cit>  suggests that fractionation may be a more plausible explanation. a comparative analysis of the genome-wide patterns of paralog-loss or retention could potentially provide insights into the genetic interactions among loci or dosage sensitivity.

the evolutionary success of hybrids is also known for seed plants, where allopolyploid offspring are sometimes more successful than the parental lines  <cit> . contrary to seed plants, which contain alleles in the dominant sporophytic generation, mosses contain only a single gene locus in the dominant haploid generation. therefore, the homeologs generated through an auto- or allopolyploidization event might represent an additional evolutionary advantage since they represent redundant gene copies , encoded on haploid segregated chromosomes. in allopolyploid hybrids, gains of genes only encoded by one of the two parental genomes might even be more beneficial if they relay an important advantage that one of the parents did not encode.

in the allopolyploid seed plant cotton the majority of expression biases are thought to be due to sub- and neofunctionalization subsequent to the polyploidization event  <cit> . indeed,  <dig> % of the homeologs are found to be transcriptionally biased, e.g., due to cis-regulatory element divergence of the parental genomes  <cit> . under the conditions applied here, both brk <dig> homeologs are expressed in the same tissue in p. collenchymatum and p. eurystomum, and in the case of p. collenchymatum their expression levels seem not to be heavily biased. allopolyploid cotton has been estimated to be  <dig>  my old  <cit> , while the separation of the parental lineages within the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex occurred ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . the hybrids studied here are likely younger than that - but we might also see different patterns or speeds of homeolog divergence between mosses and seed plants in future studies.

with regard to editing site evolution, we consider a t at nad3_ <dig> and nad4_ <dig> to be the ancestral state, since three lineages  share this characteristic, while the gain of a c in these positions can be explained by a single mutation per editing site in the lineage giving rise to physcomitrium sphaericum and physcomitrella patens . under this scenario, editing of nad3eu230sl and nad4eu272sl in the hybrid species p. eurystomum, p. collenchymatum and p. pyriforme might have become feasible by gain  of the corresponding nuclear encoded editing factor ppr_ <dig> . the gain of the editing requirement  at one or both positions in the hybrid species can be explained by either maternal transmission of the organelle and thus transfer of the mutation from the p. sphaericum parental lineage, or by the independent gain of mutations .

based on synonymous substitution plots of gene duplication events, a whole-genome duplication in p. patens has been hypothesized and dated to ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . as this is much later than the funariidae divergence ~ <dig> mya  <cit> , and gene family trees including f. hygrometrica and p. patens usually show clear ortholog pairs  <cit> , it is reasonable to assume that the previously shown paleopolyploidization  <cit>  is a common ancestral trait of all funariaceae. in this light, it is surprising that the f. hygrometrica haploid genome size measured here is significantly lower than that of p. patens. an explanation for this finding could be a much lower transposon or repetitive element content in f. hygrometrica, or a significantly different a/t content. in any case, fractionation  apparently occurred to a large extent, since the paleopolyploidization event was not detectable by means of homeologs of brk <dig> in those funariaceae that are not hybrids.

in summary,  speciation following allopolyploidization has apparently occurred several times within the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex.

revised classification of physcomitrella
by comparing the genetic diversity in the analyzed physcomitrella accessions we found consistency in three main distinctive groupings. one clade includes all european and the two north american accessions , a second clade encompasses the japanese and the australian accessions and the third lineage is represented by the african accession. hence, our results confirm recently published molecular data concerning the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex, where an independent origin of three physcomitrella lineages was assumed  <cit> . since the genetic distances between the three physcomitrella clades are as large as, or even larger than, the genetic distances to physcomitrium species, the three physcomitrella lineages should be regarded as different species. based on the results presented here, we propose a revised classification, which divides physcomitrella into three species:

 <dig>  physcomitrella patens  bruch et schimp., bryol. eur. 1:  <dig>   <dig>  basionym: phascum patens hedw. spec. musc.  <dig>   <dig> 

synonyms: physcomitrium patens  mitt., ann. mag. nat. hist., ser.  <dig>  8:  <dig>   <dig>  physcomitrella patens ssp. californica  b.c. tan, j. hattori bot. lab. 46:  <dig>   <dig> 

this taxon encompasses the european and north american accessions of p. patens ssp. patens and the north american accessions of p. patens ssp. californica.

 <dig>  physcomitrella readeri  i.g. stone & g.a.m. scott, j. bryol. 7:  <dig>   <dig>  basionym: ephemerella readeri müll. hal., hedwigia 41:  <dig>   <dig> 

synonyms: physcomitrium readeri müll. hal., gen. musc. frond.  <dig>   <dig>  nom. inval., lacking species description. physcomitridium readeri  g. roth, außereurop. laubm.  <dig>   <dig>  physcomitrella patens ssp. readeri  b.c.tan, j. hattori bot. lab. 46:  <dig>   <dig> 

this taxon encompasses the australian accessions of p. patens ssp. readeri and the japanese accessions of p. patens ssp. californica.

 <dig>  physcomitrella magdalenae de sloover, bull. jard. nat. belg.  <dig> :  <dig>   <dig> 

synonyms: physcomitrella patens ssp. magdalenae  b.c. tan, j. hattori bot. lab. 46:  <dig>   <dig>  aphanorrhegma magdalenae  ochyra, acta bot. hung. 29:  <dig>   <dig> 

this taxon encompasses the african accessions of p. patens ssp. magdalenae.

following this classification, p. patens, disjunct in north america and europe, can be clearly distinguished from p. readeri and p. magdalenae by distinct gametophytic  morphological as well as molecular characteristics.

according to the brk <dig> phylogeny and the pattern of editing sites, the stegocarpous a. serratum may also be classified as physcomitrella, although physcomitrella is cleistocarpous. thus, the funariaceae type species, f. hygrometrica, represents the most highly complex end of a morphological series, with physcomitrella/aphanorrhegma representing the other end. the origin of a cleistocarpous taxon from a stegocarpous taxon is found several times within the acrocarpous mosses. species with cleistocarpous and stegocarpous members are found e.g. in the genus pottia, where p. bryoides and p. recta are cleistocarpous while the remaining species are stegocarpous, having either no peristome, or a rudimentary or even well-developed peristome. in conclusion, as previously supposed, sporophytic characteristics cannot be used to resolve the phylogeny of the funariaceae  <cit> .

considering an independent evolution for physcomitrella from physcomitrium ancestors  <cit>  and the observed  genetic distances, the analyzed accessions of the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex may in consequence be classified as a single genus. in this case, physcomitrium would be the correct genus name as it is older than physcomitrella, dating back to  <dig>  given our present taxon sampling and data set, physcomitrella, physcomitrium and aphanorrhegma form a species complex that may or may not include additional genera, such as entosthodon and bryobeckettia <cit> . therefore, further phylogenetic studies including more accessions and more genera are required in order to confidently propose a revision in taxonomic classification at the genus level .

disjunct occurrence and long range dispersal of physcomitrella
the habitats of the physcomitrella accessions used in this work show clear similarities, as they grow on moist, often disturbed ground, typically in close proximity to water. physcomitrella shows a cosmopolitan, probably originally holarctic distribution . while one might expect genetic distances to correlate with geographic distances, the two p. patens isolates from gemünd  cluster with one of the french villersexel accessions, “k4” , and the english cholsey accession  respectively; the latter gemünd accession was characterized as var. megapolitana in the field. also, the accessions from villersexel  cluster in different parts of the p. patens genetic distance tree. these genetic distances provide evidence for either high intra-population diversity or long range dispersal.

moss spores are able to survive in mud for prolonged periods of time, a trait considered important for ephemeral species  <cit> . in particular, physcomitrella is known to quickly appear on the muddy banks of reservoirs after draining. p. patens spores are larger and fewer in number  than those of f. hygrometrica   <cit> , making them a bigger energy reservoir that might be able to boost growth as soon as the conditions are suitable. spores smaller than 20 μm are easily dispersed by wind  <cit>  and long range dispersal via this mode is evident for funaria hygrometrica <cit> , also considering its cosmopolitan distribution. given the larger spore size of p. patens, along with the fact that the plants grow on wet soil and have a cleistocarpous capsule, spore dispersal by wind is possible but appears unlikely. although long distance spore dispersal by wind cannot be excluded for physcomitrella, we suggest that spore distribution by birds  <cit>  along migration routes may also contribute to the observed disjunct distribution patterns. the disjunct distribution of p. patens on both sides of the northern atlantic may be explained by use of the east atlantic flyway, while the north american continent is covered by a total of four partially overlapping flyways  <cit> , potentially allowing the spores to spread across the continent. concerning p. readeri, which is found in japan and australia, but also in europe  <cit> , nearly identical ribosomal spacer data between the accessions from england, australia and japan suggests long range dispersal. the disjunct habitats in japan and australia are covered by the west pacific as well as by the east asian-australasian flyway used by migratory birds  <cit> . since the east asian-australasian flyway is geographically overlapping with the east atlantic flyway, dispersal from japan/australia to europe  <cit>  is theoretically possible, although less likely than, e.g., the exchange between japan and australia. we hypothesize that physcomitrella might be dispersed via migratory  birds along flyways since the observed habitats follow a distribution pattern coinciding with such flyways. when the ssr data are visualized as a network, potential genetic flow is also supported. while reticulate structures are present mainly within p. patens and p. readeri, there is also evidence for alleles that are potentially exchanged between both species. interestingly, based on the ssr data no exchange is evident between p. magdalenae, p. sphaericum and any of the other accessions.

independent secondary reduction of funariaceae sporophyte complexity
considering the fact that characteristic structural features of moss sporophytes can be correlated with specialized habitats  <cit> , the most likely secondary reduction of the physcomitrella sporophyte to a cleistocarpous capsule with reduced seta and increased spore size may be interpreted as an adaptation to an ephemeral life style. given the polyphyletic origin of the three cryptic  physcomitrella species, a convergent evolutionary process in which the seta is reduced and the capsule is no longer dehiscent can be assumed. p. patens inhabits an ephemeral habitat, e.g. on banks of rivers and ponds which dry up in summer or autumn. the species has a short life cycle of up to two months from spore germination to the development of spores  <cit> . besides a reduced sporophyte, a shortened life cycle also represents a typical adaptation to a highly unpredictable and ephemeral habitat  <cit> . in physcomitrella, the gametophore is reduced as well, forming a small rosette with its apparent main function being the production of gametangia and spore capsules. as a semi-aquatic moss, the spores are most likely released into water or mud. this mode of spore dispersal does not require a lid or a peristome at the capsule, but rather the disintegration of the capsule when mature spores have developed.

the funariaceae feature highly variable sporophyte architectures, and sporophytes of interspecies hybrids usually display intermediate or maternal phenotypes  <cit> . it has been argued that evolutionary pressure may force changes to moss sporophyte architecture rather than conserving it  <cit> . in summary, we hypothesize that probably parapatric speciation via establishing an ecological niche, namely the resting of spores in the mud, their potential dispersal by birds rather than by wind, and an ephemeral life cycle, has led to the independent evolution of a reduced sporophyte in the three physcomitrella lineages – making them cryptic species if one considers sporophyte morphology alone.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we present molecular insights into the global genetic diversity of the physcomitrium-physcomitrella species complex, providing evidence for sympatric speciation involving allopolyploidization, as well as for convergent evolution leading to a reduced sporophyte, large spores, and a colonization of a humid, ephemeral, moist habitat, possibly concomitant with possible parapatric speciation. primarily, the sequenced p. patens isolate from gransden  has to date been widely used as an experimental model in comparative plant sciences, followed by the french isolate villersexel “k3” that has been used for the generation of a genetic map  <cit>  and for crossing experiments with “gransden” and other isolates  <cit> . the present collection of axenic in vitro cultures of funariaceae accessions, together with the molecular data presented here, is expected to boost the research into natural variation and trait evolution of this emerging model system representing haploid-dominant land plants. resequencing of funariaceae accessions will lead to insights into genome evolution and its coupling to trait evolution.
