BACKGROUND
candida albicans is an important human fungal pathogen because of its clinical significance as well as its use as an experimental model for scientific investigation  <cit> . this opportunistic pathogen is a natural component of the human skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary flora, but it can sporadically cause a variety of infections. although many candida infections are not life-threatening , immunosuppressed patients can be subjected to potentially lethal systemic infections, and therefore candida infections are a major public health concern  <cit> . c. albicans can also colonize various biomaterials, and readily forms dense, complex biofilms that are resistant to most antifungal agents. because of the challenges of drug resistance  <cit>  and the eukaryotic nature of c. albicans that makes it similar to its human host, extensive efforts are underway to identify new drug targets for therapeutic intervention; many of these take advantage of tools from the genomic era  <cit> . because of some of its unique biological features, c. albicans is also becoming attractive to studies of more fundamental aspects of genome maintenance, regulatory biology and morphogenesis  <cit> .

the diploid nature and the absence of a complete sexual cycle in c. albicans reduces the ease with which genetic manipulations can be achieved  <cit> . therefore, biochemical, cell biological and genomic analyses of gene products provide alternate strategies to improve our understanding of this pathogen. in particular, obtaining a better insight into how specific protein complexes assemble in c. albicans would help define targets for drug development. for example, the large-scale definition of protein complexes by tandem affinity purification , as it was previously done in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , should reveal the architecture of biochemical networks and protein machines specific to c. albicans. this approach would also give insight into the evolution of protein complexes in ascomycetes. as well, the availability of tools allowing comprehensive functional analysis of transcription factors  on a genome-wide scale could enhance cellular studies. genome-wide location analysis, or chip-chip analysis  followed by dna microarrays ) allows the identification of direct targets of a defined tf on a genomic scale  <cit> . this approach has been comprehensively applied to the model budding yeast s. cerevisiae in order to map its transcriptional regulatory network  <cit> . while first developed in s. cerevisiae, chip-chip has since been applied to other organisms including c. albicans  <cit> . in addition, c. albicans has recently been established as an interesting model organism for the study of the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks. in fact, it appears that c. albicans differs significantly in its mode of gene regulation from the well-characterized s. cerevisiae transcriptional circuits. it has recently served as a comparative system for studying the evolution of the mating type control circuit and the evolution of ribosomal protein  regulation  <cit> . furthermore, changes occuring in the activity of tfs seem to account for part of acquired drug resistance in c. albicans  <cit> . moreover, several tfs play a critical role in the c. albicans morphological transitions and in biofilm formation  <cit> . therefore, a detailed understanding of the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in c. albicans would be valuable for basic research purposes as well as for improving our understanding of drug resistance and for aiding in the development of new antifungals.

here we report the construction of a new set of pcr-based epitope-tagging vectors for c. albicans that is successfully applied to perform a biochemical characterization of the small processome subunit via nop <dig> tandem affinity purification as well as genome-wide location analysis of the model tfs tbf <dig>  cbf <dig> and mcm <dig> 

RESULTS
a set of pcr cassettes for protein tagging
the choice of selectable marker genes in our cassettes, ura <dig>  his <dig> and arg <dig> was guided by the availability of the c. albicans strains bwp <dig> and sn <dig> that have the auxotrophic mutations  <cit> . our cassettes permit the use of a single 120-bp primer pair  to tag genes with three epitopes . in addition, our pcr strategy is compatible with the previously published pfa-xfp-tagging system  <cit> . with this vector set, the tagged protein is expressed under the control of its own regulatory sequences and chromatin environment and thus at its normal physiological levels, thereby maximizing the biological relevance of biochemical analyses.

the ha and myc epitope tags have been used to tag proteins in various organisms and for various applications  <cit> . they represent highly immunogenic peptides with little biological activity that can then be used in immunoprecipitation/co-immunoprecipitation experiments to validate protein complex formation. the tap tag was more recently developed in order to obtain high purified protein samples for mass spectrometry analysis of protein complexes  <cit> . tagged strains were first validated by pcr and subsequently by western blotting , and we confirmed that the tagged constructs are easily immunoprecipitated . doubly tagged strains can also be obtained with combinations of selective markers offered by the bwp <dig> and the sn <dig> strain backgrounds. we produced tbf1-ha/cbf1-myc and reciprocal tagged stains .

tandem affinity purification of nop1
since its introduction in  <dig>  the tap-tag has been used in various organisms to perform protein-complex purifications  <cit> . in s. cerevisiae, it has been used to assess protein-protein interactions on a large scale  <cit> . we performed a standard tap procedure using the tap-tagged nop <dig>  a component of the small processome subunit in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . mass spectrometric analysis of in-solution digested tca-precipitated proteins after the tap procedure identified  <dig> c. albicans proteins and in-gel digestion of four sypro ruby stained sds-page bands led to the identification of an additional protein . in total,  <dig> c. albicans proteins were identified,  <dig> of which are bona fide components of the s. cerevisiae small sub-unit processome    <cit> . in addition, three ribosomal proteins were co-purified with nop1; ribosomal proteins are common false positives in protein complex purification procedures  <cit> . we compared the coverage generated through our approach to that of the orthologous nop1-tap purification in s. cerevisiae. the c. albicans nop1-tap bait retrieved  <dig> proteins  of the annotated ssu processome subunits while its s. cerevisiae ortholog retrieved  <dig>  , so the coverage of the s. cerevisiae set was higher. however, the proportion of core components of the ssu processome retrieved in c. albicans  surpasses the proportion retrieved in s. cerevisiae by all published affinity-capture followed by mass spectrometry studies  <cit> . it is likely that the stringency of our protocol accounts for the lower coverage and higher specificity of the set of hits retrieved; modifications of the purification conditions could allow for the desired specificity. overall, it is apparent that a basic tap protocol is amenable to c. albicans proteins. this approach will be of great utility in the analysis of function of currently poorly defined proteins and in the study of the evolution of protein complexes in yeasts.

* nop <dig> was the bait in this tandem affinity purification experiment.

** utp <dig> was identified by in-gel but not in-solution digestion.

chip-chip analysis of in vivo tagged transcription factors
one potential application of tap-tagged tfs consists of their use in chip-chip to map their dna-binding targets in vivo. chip-chip was therefore performed for three tap-tagged tfs; tbf <dig>  cbf <dig> and mcm <dig>  for tbf <dig> and cbf <dig>  the results obtained were compared to previously published data using ectopically expressed tbf1-ha and cbf1-ha constructs  <cit> . the location profiles of tap-tagged tfs were essentially identical to the previous results and confirmed that the rp regulon is dominated by the myb transcription factor tbf <dig> working in conjunction with cbf <dig>   <cit> .

genome-wide location of the s. cerevisae mads box cell cycle regulator ortholog mcm <dig> was also investigated in c. albicans cells. s. cerevisiae mcm <dig> plays a critical role in the regulation of cell cycle transitions and, more specifically, of the pre-replication complex . the mcm <dig> paralog arg <dig> arose after the whole-genome duplication of the yeast lineage and is involved in the regulation of arginine metabolism genes  <cit> . the overlap of our mcm <dig> genome-wide binding data in yeast state cells with a previously published mcm <dig> chip-chip done on tiling microarrays is highly significant  with  <dig> genes common between studies  <cit>  . we confirm that c. albicans mcm <dig> occupies the roles of s. cerevisiae mcm <dig> and arg <dig> since genes from the arginine biosynthesis pathway such as arg3/4/5â€“6/ <dig>  car <dig> and the zinc transcription factor arg <dig> are enriched in our set . genes involved in the biosynthesis of the other basic amino acid, lysine , and also catabolic proline processing  are also enriched in ours and tuch et al.  gene lists . in addition, we confirm that mcm <dig> binds strongly to its own promoter . we finally confirm a previous study revealing that c. albicans mcm <dig> regulates mdr <dig> expression and thereby, drug resistance  <cit> . indeed, a significant enrichment  of mcm <dig> binding to the promoter of the drug efflux facilitator gene mdr <dig> was observed in both yeast and hyphal states.

* genes in common with chip-chip data of tuch et al.,  using tiling array.

however, our data diverges from the other mcm <dig> chip-chip publications at some points. first, our results show mcm <dig> binding in the promoters of almost all members of the pre-replication complex   while the tuch et al.  data only uncovered two members of this complex . in addition, we detected reproducible mcm <dig> binding at two origin-recognition-complex components  and the loading factor for the mcm complex, cdc <dig> . second, binding of the promoters of the cyclin genes cln <dig>  hgc <dig> and clb <dig> by mcm <dig> was not detected in our experimental setup . in total,  <dig> mcm <dig> targets are uniquely found in the tuch et al. gene list  <cit> . these major differences are likely due to variations between the two independently conducted studies. tuch and collaborators 1) treated their cells with pheromone, 2) used a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against an mcm <dig> peptide, 3) used signal ratios of cy <dig> labelled ip versus cy <dig> labelled whole-cell extract prior to performing the ip and 4) used tiling arrays to determine the promoter targets of mcm <dig>  our procedure is somewhat different: we 1) used ypd grown cells, 2) used igg beads-proteina interaction to enrich target regions, 3) compared each experimental ip to a mock ip performed in untagged cells and 4) used full genome arrays with smaller coverage . all these experimental changes could affect to different degrees the final result of a chip-chip. first, treating cells with pheromone might dramatically alter mcm <dig> binding at some point in the cell cycle and pheromone response elements and deplete it at others . second, polyclonal anti-mcm <dig> antibodies can have cross-specificities that would not be corrected for by using the whole-cell extract as a control instead of a mock ip or an ip performed with a preimmune serum. third, the different resolutions of the two studies could account for some overlooked targets in our experiments.

we also performed mcm1-tap chip-chip in the yeast to hyphal transition triggered by serum at 37Â°c. mcm <dig> was recruited to a limited set of genes  under these conditions . noticeably, it was enriched in the promoters of als <dig>  hwp <dig> and ece <dig> after hyphal induction .

thus, our genome-wide location data showed a significant consistency with previously published results on the three tfs. this suggests that our chromosomally tagged alleles are functional and that the use of a tap-igg pull-down protocol is applicable for chip-chip as previously reported in s. cerevisiae  <dig> and that this protocol is comparable to a chip method based on a anti-ha  or rabbit polyclonal  antibody ip.

in vivo beta-galactosidase reporter assays
the beta-galactosidase reporter system described here has already been applied to the problem of rp gene regulation in hogues et al . it allows the integration of reporter constructs in the actual chromatin environment of the gene of interest. here, we describe its usefulness in the quantitative study of active gene loci. we produced plys9-lacz and popi3-lacz strains and beta-galactosidase reporter assays were performed with ypd grown cells. our results show variable levels of reporter activity across these three promoters . the multiple cloning site of our pfa-lacz-ura <dig> construct allows the easy creation of various cis-regulatory mutants as examplified by the the prpl <dig> promoter   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
here, we have presented a new set of tools for functional characterization of c. albicans gene products by biochemical methods. we believe that the availability of such tools will greatly help future understanding of the biology of this important human pathogen.
