BACKGROUND
massively parallel pyrosequencing via roche's  <dig> platform  <cit>  has great potential for identifying genes of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists. the  <dig> approach provides more accurate base calling and deeper sequencing coverage than is possible with conventional sanger sequencing while dramatically decreasing labor  <cit> . for the most part, pyrosequencing has so far been restricted to model organisms  <cit>  or species closely related to a model  <cit>  because of the short reads which make de novo genome sequencing difficult without a scaffold  <cit> . however, the depth of coverage provided by the roche  <dig> platform means that transcriptomes of non-model organisms can be characterized without a genome sequence. recently,  <dig> technology has been applied to transcriptomes of the rose gum tree  and the glanville fritillary butterfly . these studies illustrate the potential of  <dig> pyrosequencing to rapidly characterize expressed genes that can be used to address pertinent questions regarding a species' ecology, life history, and evolution  <cit> .

a complete description of expressed sequence tags  provides an overview of the transcriptome, those genes expressed  in a given tissue at a specific point in time. pyrosequencing of ests can be used to characterize gene expression  <cit> , qtl  <cit> , single nucleotide polymorphisms , and patterns of selection  <cit> . the identification of snps is especially appealing in non-model species because as genetic markers, snps can illuminate population structure, sex ratios, and genetic variability  <cit> . recently,  <dig> sequencing has been used to identify tens of thousands of snps in inbred lines of maize and in e. grandis  <cit>  demonstrating the power of pyrosequencing for snp discovery.

there are many factors to be considered prior to transcriptome characterization, including the expected number of unique transcripts in the sampled tissue and their relative abundance. when it comes to sequencing effort, transcriptome sequencing needs to be deep in order to identify rare transcripts and to overcome short read lengths, but the absolute depth required is usually unknown although important for quantifying levels of gene expression. if the relative abundance of transcripts is not critical, normalization can enhance the identification of rare transcripts by reducing the number of overabundant transcripts  <cit> . this is especially important when sequencing from cdna pooled from many different organs/tissues or individuals . however, in non-model species with poorly characterized genomes, it may not be apparent if relative gene expression is responsible for an interesting phenotype. to date, the costs and benefits of normalization have been evaluated only in model species where entire genome sequences are available .

we are interested in the sex determining mechanisms of fishes, and  <dig> pyrosequencing of gonad transcriptomes may provide a powerful approach for understanding the genetic architecture of sexual differentiation. in particular, we are interested in lake sturgeon , a species of conservation concern in north america due to historical overharvest, pollution and habitat fragmentation  <cit> . the restoration of lake sturgeon populations is complicated by their biology, namely delayed sexual maturity , infrequent spawning , and sexual monomorphism  <cit> . with regard to the latter issue, dna sexing assays have proven invaluable in the conservation of other sexually monomorphic species and could be a great boon for lake sturgeon biologists  <cit> . however, the search for sturgeon sex determining genes has so far been unsuccessful  <cit> . this is probably because the genetics of sex determination in fishes is much more complicated  than in mammals and birds  <cit> . furthermore, the lake sturgeon genome is large  and polyploid  <cit> .

herein we present the results of a pilot study designed to characterize gonad transcriptomes in lake sturgeon. to our knowledge, this is the first such study in vertebrates and the first in a polyploid species. our ultimate goal is to provide an overview of transcription in lake sturgeon gonads, including the discovery of new genes and the snps they harbor. our proximate goals were a) to evaluate the relative merits of normalization for  <dig> runs and b) to evaluate an ecological technique used to determine species richness  and establish its usefulness in gene discovery. we did so by performing five titration runs on the  <dig> using two normalized and three non-normalized  pools of cdna.

RESULTS
gene and snp discovery
sequence assembly
libraries  <dig> and  <dig> were normalized whereas native libraries 3– <dig> were not. the titration runs produced  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  sequences from libraries one through five respectively, for a total of  <dig>  reads. these yielded  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads after quality control . mean read length varied across libraries, with longer sequences in the normalized libraries . the number of contigs varied from  <dig> to  <dig> across libraries and mean read depth per contig varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  sequences . figures  <dig> and  <dig> represent contig length and contig depth as averaged across the normalized and native libraries. regression analysis indicated there was a significant positive relationship between contig length and contig depth , p = <  <dig> ).

xenobiotics
pyrosequencing from metazoan tissues can produce sequences from endosymbionts  <cit> . of the lake sturgeon ests that passed quality control ,  <dig> % blasted back to vertebrates,  <dig> % to invertebrates,  <dig> % to bacteria,  <dig> % to plants, and  <dig> % to fungi . the mean e-value for the top blast hits to vertebrates was  <dig>  × 10- <dig> , compared to  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  for non-vertebrate taxa. of the ests with a top blast hit to vertebrates, 59% had a top blast hit to a fish species, 29% matched a mammal,  <dig> % a reptile or amphibian, and  <dig> % a bird . the blast hits to fishes most frequently matched zebrafish, pufferfish, and trout .

gene ontologies
all lake sturgeon reads that passed qc were annotated for sequence similarities using blastx against the genbank database; over  <dig>  produced a significant blastx hit . gene ontology  assignments were broken into molecular function, biological process, and cellular components. go analyses categorized ests into one of  <dig> molecular function categories; those most highly represented include protein binding, rna binding, and zinc ion binding. sixteen of the  <dig> molecular function categories  differed statistically with regard to their representation between normalized and native libraries . for example, a much higher proportion of sequences from the native libraries were rna binding genes  than in the normalized libraries . a higher proportion of sequences from the normalized libraries were involved in several key pathways  than in the native libraries .

p-value significance; * =  <dig> , ** =  <dig> , *** =  <dig> .

go analysis identified  <dig> biological process categories, including translation, muscle cell differentiation, and transport. fifteen of these  <dig>  were represented unequally between the normalized and native libraries . not surprisingly, genes involved in protein translation exhibited the biggest differences in expression;  <dig> % of sequences in the normalized libraries were involved in translation compared to  <dig> % of sequences in the native libraries .

p-value significance; * =  <dig> , ** =  <dig> , *** =  <dig> .

go analysis identified  <dig> cellular components among our ests, including cytoplasm, mitochondrion, and membrane. twelve of the  <dig>  were represented unequally between the libraries . four gene classes  were overrepresented in the native libraries. the other  <dig> were more abundant in the normalized libraries.

p-value significance; * =  <dig> , ** =  <dig> , *** =  <dig> .

snp detection
we identified  <dig> candidate snps from  <dig>  contigs whose sequences spanned  <dig>  bp; this equates to  <dig> snp every  <dig> bp. of the  <dig> snps, only  <dig> were insertion/deletions whereas  <dig> were substitutions. a total of  <dig> snps  were singletons present in one read within a contig. of the  <dig> snps that appeared in multiple reads,  <dig> occurred in different fish . table  <dig> summarizes a subset of the snp data, those snps found in genes of known function, and with a ts/tv ratio of less than  <dig>  these genes could be targets of selection . snp density varied across genes, this may be due in part to strong historical selection, and the ts/tv ratio can help identify such genes  <cit> . a total of  <dig> snps were transitions and  <dig> snps were transversions, giving a mean ts/tv ratio of  <dig>  across the transcriptomes. we estimated the ts/tv ratio for all contigs that blasted to a known gene ; their frequency distribution is shown in figure  <dig> 

the contigs listed below include only those with a significant blast hit and at least one snp and with a ts/tv ratio <  <dig>  . in other words, the snps described in this table are a subset of the  <dig> we identified, but includes all of those associated with a particular gene and with a ts/tv ratio <  <dig> . see additional file  <dig> for information from those contigs that produced a ts/tv ratio ≥  <dig> .

rarefaction and normalization
rarefaction analysis was pioneered in theoretical ecology, where it was used to evaluate species richness  <cit> . it has more recently been adopted in population genetics  <cit>  and it has potential utility in genomics, particularly with regard to gene discovery as a function of effort. figure  <dig> illustrates the difference in gene discovery rates in normalized and native libraries. figure 5a plots our empirical data with the curves truncated at  <dig> reads , whereas figure 5b shows simulated data based on the projection of the curves in figure 5a. when using both empirical and simulated data, the rate of gene discovery is moderately faster in the normalized libraries, but only up to ~ <dig>  sequences.

discussion
gene and snp discovery
sequence assembly
we performed five roche  <dig> titration runs on lake sturgeon cdna samples with the ultimate goal of characterizing  a polyploid vertebrate transcriptome. the lake sturgeon data compare favorably with other  <dig> cdna studies of non-model species, both in terms of read length and contig assembly. mean length of lake sturgeon reads after removing primers, linkers, and substandard bases was  <dig> bp, in between the  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp reported in similar non-model  <dig> studies  <cit> . likewise, our mean contig length  and depth  were similar to the fritillary assembly  and the eucalypt assembly . reads generated by  <dig> sequencing are generally shorter than those produced by dideoxy sequencing, but the base-calling accuracy of the  <dig> is equivalent or even superior to conventional sequencing  <cit> . furthermore, the absolute number of reads produced in a run can help increase overall accuracy.

xenobiotics
in the glanville fritillary butterfly,  <dig> transcriptomics provided evidence of microsporidia, intracellular parasites that affect insect population dynamics  <cit> . thus it is possible that some of the sequences in our data set are from xenobiotics that are commensal with lake sturgeon. however,  <dig> % of our sequences with a significant blast hit best matched a vertebrate, and of these 59% best matched another fish suggesting the vast majority of our sequences originated from lake sturgeon. interestingly,  <dig>  of our sequences blasted to a bacterial species. this could be due to noise  or to true xenobiotics that are lake sturgeon commensals, pathogens, or parasites. of these  <dig> sequences, the average top blast hit had an e-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  an order of magnitude less than the average top blast hits to vertebrates  but still high, suggesting the presence of xenobiotics in our gonad samples. the top blast hits to bacteria were from a variety of species, of which  <dig> % were aquatic. of the reads that blasted to bacteria,  <dig> % were to pathogenic species. because our sequences were derived from reproductive tissues, some of the bacterial sequences could belong to sexually transmitted pathogens or wolbachia-type microorganisms, although our preliminary analyses revealed no hits to sexually transmitted microorganisms. further investigation of lake sturgeon xenobiotics could prove informative regarding coevolution, disease, and infection.

gene ontologies
in principle, go analysis can help gauge the merits and demerits of normalization. by comparing go results from the normalized and native libraries, some interesting trends emerge. for instance, 32% of the annotated genes within the go molecular function category were singletons in the native libraries compared to 6% in the normalized libraries.  results from the biological process category were similar, with singletons comprising 32% of the native libraries compared to 15% in the normalized libraries. in terms of molecular function, the most striking result is the abundance of rrna genes . a total of  <dig> % of all sequences from the native libraries are rna binding genes as compared to  <dig> % from the normalized libraries. in other words, normalization is effective at tempering the signature of abundant transcripts exactly as expected. however, even without normalization more than 60% of transcripts were not rrnas. this suggests that many transcriptomics studies should forego normalization, as native libraries allow one to answer questions regarding gene dosage  whereas normalized libraries do not. clearly, this decision depends on the depth of coverage expected and the design of the study.

snp detection
we identified a total of  <dig> candidate snps in lake sturgeon, about one every  <dig> bp. this compares to one in every  <dig> bp in eucalypt  <cit>  and one in  <dig> bp in maize  <cit> . previous studies have used sanger sequencing to confirm ~80% of snps initially identified via  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . due to the polyploid nature of the lake sturgeon genome, we might have expected more diversity than in the diploids , but as mentioned earlier lake sturgeon are of conservation concern. our source population was established from a few wild fish less than  <dig> years ago  <cit> , and thus our snp data may not reflect broader patterns of genetic diversity in lake sturgeon. the snp frequency estimate of  <dig> per ~ <dig> bp includes all snps identified in all contigs in the data set. however, the snp frequency in contigs that produced a significant blast hit was  <dig> per ~ <dig> bp. this is due to the removal of short contigs that are less likely to both a) contain snps and b) produce a significant blast hit. this bias is especially prevalent in our data as the majority of contigs are ≤  <dig> bps.

our snp discovery requirements were stringent  and our estimates of snp density should be quite conservative. for example, we documented only  <dig> indels despite the susceptibility of  <dig> sequencing technology to indel-type errors  <cit> . sixty-six of the candidate snps we identified were seen in multiple fish; these could be orthologous intraspecific polymorphisms  or intragenomic polymorphisms due to gene duplications . population surveys will be required to discriminate among these alternatives. eighteen candidate snps were unique to one sex;  <dig> were unique to males  and  <dig> unique to female . three contigs that had snps unique to males produced a significant blast hit; contigs  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , which produced a top blast hit to orf <dig>  transposase, and a muscle binding protein respectively. none of these genes are expected a priori to be involved in sexual differentiation, but further research will determine if these candidate snps might play a role in sex determination or will prove useful for sex identification.

we investigated the ts/tv ratio of snps in genes with a significant blast hit to help identify potential targets of selection, as transversions are rarer than transitions in neutral genes  <cit> . the plot of ts/tv ratios  shows that the majority of genes have either a ts/tv ratio near  <dig>  or greater than  <dig> . only seven contigs produced a ts/tv ratio <  <dig> . these contigs produced a top blast hit to orf <dig>  calmodulin, xxc finger  <dig>  ribosomal rrna s <dig>  endonuclease reverse transcriptase, polyprotein, and tc1-like transposase. of these, tc1-like transposase may be of interest as studies on salmon have found similar signatures of selection on this gene  <cit> . tc1-like transposase is co-regulated with other genes implicated in the immune response, signal transduction, and regulation of transcription. moreover, tc1-like domains reside in a number of immune and stress-related salmonid genes  <cit>  and probably perform similar functions in lake sturgeon.

rarefaction and normalization
rarefaction has proven valuable in ecology and population genetics ; in this paper we demonstrate that rarefaction is also useful in the context of gene discovery. in the lake sturgeon, every  <dig>  reads  resulted in a different significant blast hit . to truly evaluate gene expression, sequencing effort must be sufficient to detect each rna species and its dosage. in other words, the absolute depth of sequencing coverage required is a function of the total number of transcripts and their relative abundance. cdna normalization is often employed when gene discovery  is the primary consideration  <cit> . normalization effectively reduces the expression of common genes, thus enhancing detection of rare transcripts relative to a native library. however, in many cases  it may not be clear a priori if dosage is important  <cit> . our data indicate the depth of sequencing coverage provided by next-generation sequencing platforms may obviate the need for normalization. for example, the proportion of singletons following contig assembly was ~65% of the reads in the normalized libraries and ~67% in the native libraries. thus, normalization has little impact on the discovery of rare transcripts when thousands of sequences are considered. the rarefaction curves in figure 5b illustrate this point; after ~ <dig> sequences, there is no real advantage to normalization. given that next-generation pyrosequencing approaches all generate tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences, our data suggest that normalization is not usually necessary and can obscure the relative gene expression data that can be inferred from native pools of cdna.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that it is possible to use  <dig> sequencing methods to rapidly characterize transcriptomes in non-model species of conservation concern, notably a polyploid vertebrate with a large genome. we have identified over  <dig> ests from lake sturgeon that are represented by similar sequences in genbank; we also identified  <dig> candidate snps. we used ts/tv ratios to identify specific ests that might have been targets of selection, and we determined that lake sturgeon snps occur  every few hundred bp in transcribed genes. titration runs indicate that normalization is not normally necessary when thousands of sequences from a single tissue type are considered. finally, we have utilized ecological rarefaction in a genomics context to gauge the relative intensity of sampling required for gene discovery . overall, pyrosequencing has great potential to rapidly identify genes of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists, including those from species of conservation concern.
