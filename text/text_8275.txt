BACKGROUND
cnidarians  are the closest group of animals to the bilateria , and are thus an important taxon to understand the origin and evolution of complex traits such as nervous systems  <cit> . nematostella vectensis is a proven cnidarian model because it is easy to maintain in laboratory culture, its genome is sequenced and annotated, and multiple tools exist for functional genetic approaches .

the nematostella nervous system comprises endodermal and ectodermal nerve nets  <cit> . neuronal cell bodies are arranged in a “salt-and-pepper pattern” such that individual neurons are scattered amongst non-neural cell types. differentiating neurons are first detected in the late blastula stage before invagination of the presumptive endodermal plate  <cit> . salt-and-pepper expression of both nvsoxb and nvath-like  are the earliest known neurally expressed genes and they define proliferative neural progenitor cells  <cit> . shortly after nvath-like and nvsoxb are detected, expression of post mitotic neural markers such as nvasha and nvelav <dig> is detected . nvelav <dig> is broadly expressed in a large number of neurons, though it is still unclear if it is a pan-neuronal marker in nematostella  <cit> . morpholino -mediated knockdown of either nvsoxb or nvath-like results in a loss of expression of both nvelav <dig> and the neural subtype marker nvasha  <cit> . nvasha is expressed in a smaller number of developing neurons at embryonic stages  <cit> . functional characterization of nvasha clearly demonstrated that it is necessary and sufficient to promote expression of the neural marker nvelav <dig> and a number of putative neural subtype markers  <cit> . based on previous work, a reasonable model for nematostella neurogenesis is that notch activity selects nvath-like + nvsoxb + neural progenitors from a pool of naïve cells; daughters of those progenitor cells express additional neurogenic genes such as nvasha, which in turn promote expression of post mitotic markers such as nvelav <dig> and neural subtype markers  <cit> . however, the upstream inductive mechanisms responsible for initiating neurogenic cascades in nematostella remain elusive, as do the molecular programs that give rise to nvasha-independent neural subtypes during neurogenesis.

fgf, wnt, bmp, and mitogen-activated protein kinase  signaling cascades regulate neural induction in multiple species . fgf, wnt, and mapk all promote neural development in other species , whereas bmp activity is best known for its role in suppressing neural induction of the forming central nervous systems of model systems  <cit> . in nematostella the role of these signaling pathways during neural induction is unclear. disruption of wnt signaling does result in neural phenotypes. however, the phenotypes are attributable to disrupted axial patterning . neural phenotypes resulting from loss and gain of bmp activity are complicated in that either manipulation results in loss of neurons, and neural phenotypes are restricted to larval stages  <cit> . fgf-mediated mapk signaling is one of many ways to initiate a receptor tyrosine kinase  cascade. investigation of fgf signaling in nematostella has primarily focused on its role in apical organ formation, and no broad neural phenotypes are reported, with the caveat that the current array of neural markers did not exist at the time of the initial study  <cit> . to date, the impact of mapk signaling on neurogenesis has not been reported in nematostella.

rtk signaling cascades are characterized by a series of kinases that are activated by upstream kinase and in turn activate a downstream kinase. near the end of the cascade, activated mek kinase phosphorylates erk, which can translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate and activate a number of transcription factors. multiple rtk signaling cascades converge on mek. for example, in nematostella, fgf signaling controls apical organ formation at larval stages, and pharmacological inhibition of mek is able to phenocopy gene-specific mo-mediated knockdown of the fgf-receptor nvfgfra  <cit> . the number of mapk-like pathways that could be acting to regulate neural development in nematostella is large. there are at least  <dig> fgf-like ligands and two fgf receptors in the nematostella genome  <cit> . two ligands and one receptor  are expressed in the vegetal hemisphere/apical domain, the ligand nvfgf <dig> is expressed in the animal hemisphere and its descendants, and the receptor nvfgfrb in derivatives of both poles . there are at least  <dig> additional receptors  that could activate mek/erk signaling in nematostella. because the number of possible rtks is relatively high, one strategy to better understand how these genes might be acting to regulate neurogenesis is to inhibit mek. thus, a number of possible signaling pathways can be simultaneously disrupted to determine if mapk signaling contributes to neural development.

here we use u <dig>  a potent and specific inhibitor of mek  <cit> , to test if mapk signaling plays a role in neurogenesis, and to determine if we can use this disruption to identify other putative neural genes in the early embryo. we show that treatment with u <dig> reduces expression of nvath-like, nvsoxb, nvasha, and post-mitotic neural markers. loss of embryonic neurogenesis following u <dig> treatment cannot be rescued by nvasha, suggesting u <dig> treatment desensitizes embryonic cells from responding to proneural cues. we performed a genome-wide expression array to identify new mek downstream targets, enabling us to characterize  <dig> novel salt-and-pepper-expressed genes. we tested the role of the putative fgf receptor nvfgfra, which was the most likely candidate pathway disrupted by u <dig> in regards to neural marker expression. however, we found no evidence suggesting that nvfgfra signaling regulates neurogenesis or any of the salt-and-pepper genes identified in the u <dig> microarray. we also investigated the relationship of these novel salt-and-pepper genes with nvasha-dependent neurogenesis. we confirmed one positive and one negative target of nvasha, nvvsx-like and nvath-like respectively. lastly, we expanded our study to gain insight into whether nvasha regulated one or multiple neuronal subtypes. using transgenic animals and double fluorescent mrna in situ hybridization, we confirmed that nvasha regulates at least two distinct neural subtypes; however, based on its expression pattern at later developmental stages  <cit> , this number is likely much higher. additionally, the identification of ~ <dig> genes that are expressed in the presumptive endomesoderm and aboral pole suggests that mapk signaling plays a key role in multiple aspects of nematostella embryogenesis. taken together, our data and previously published results allow us to incorporate mek, a key regulator, in a preliminary gene regulatory network describing embryonic nvasha-dependent neurogenesis, and provided us with a list of additional likely neurogenic genes, aboral genes, and endomesodermal genes for future studies.

RESULTS
determining ideal dose of u <dig> to inhibit mek inhibition
to determine the most effective concentration of u <dig> to use for our analyses, we treated fertilized zygotes with increasing concentrations of u <dig> and analyzed expression of the previously described u <dig> target nvfgfa <dig> as well as two markers of the animal hemisphere, nvsprouty and nvbra  <cit>  . nvsprouty was expressed throughout a central domain at the animal pole in the presumptive endoderm . these two additional markers were chosen because we observed gastrulation failures in preliminary tests of the u <dig> compound on early embryos and, in bilaterians, expression of sprouty homologs is downstream of fgf signaling   <cit> . u <dig> treatments of 1–10 μm reduced nvsprouty expression, but had little to no impact on the expression of nvfgfa <dig> or nvbra . however, at a concentration of 15 μm, both nvfgfa <dig> and nvsprouty were undetectable in u0126-treated animals . interestingly, treatment with 15 μm u <dig> induced ectopic nvbra expression within the endoderm-forming central domain , suggesting that mek signaling actively represses nvbra in the most central endoderm-forming domain. based on the ectopic expression of nvbra in the central domain as well as the complete inhibition of nvsprouty and nvfgfa <dig> expression in 15 μm treatments , we concluded that 15 μm of u <dig> is an effective dose, and it is unlikely phenotypes are due to toxicity.fig.  <dig> dose-dependent effects of the mek inhibitor u <dig> on embryonic gene expression. control blastula stages at 24 hours post fertilization  and embryos treated with increasing concentrations of u <dig> . in situ hybridization on blastula stages using nvsprouty , nvbrachyury , or nvfgfa <dig>  antisense probes. all images are lateral views with the presumptive endomesoderm  to the top. the insets correspond to animal pole views. numbers in lower left corner correspond to the number of animals with phenotype pictured / total number of animals assayed

inhibition of mek prevents erk phosphorylation and gastrulation
to ensure u <dig> treatment is inhibiting mek, we screened embryos treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide  as a control or u <dig> for the presence of phosphorylated erk    <cit> . perk staining in controls was detected at low levels in most cells of the blastula, but was enriched in the presumptive endoderm cells that undergo invagination . in u <dig> treatments, a positive perk signal above the general ectodermal staining was not detected . we further analyzed the morphological phenotypes induced by the disruption of erk signaling and observed that treated embryos dramatically failed to gastrulate and form a gut  compared to control embryos .

nvasha, nvath-like, and nvsoxb are globally downregulated in u0126-treated embryos
we next tested if u <dig> treatment would disrupt expression of the known neural genes. we treated embryos with u <dig> and scored for expression of known neural genes nvasha, nvath-like, and nvsoxb . mrna in situ hybridization on u0126-treated and control animals during early gastrula stages   revealed that all three genes—nvasha, nvsoxb, and nvath-like—were globally reduced in u0126-treated animals . however, they did not all display the same sensitivity to u <dig>  nvath-like expression was undetectable in 82 % and nvasha expression was undetectable in 96 % of u0126-treated embryos . nvsoxb <dig> expression was dramatically reduced, both in terms of the number of cells expressing it and in the level of expression , but expression was detectable in many more embryos than observed for either nvasha or nvath-like. interestingly, we identified nvsoxb as being maternally expressed using the seabase database of transcriptomes  . to address whether or not u <dig> might have a more severe impact on nvsoxb, we treated animals at late gastrula stages for 24 hours with u <dig> or dmso control. we observed that nvsoxb expression was not detectable in 87 % of u0126-treated cells . we also observed a strong reduction in nvasha expression in animals treated with u <dig> for 24 hours after completion of gastrulation . these data suggest that the earliest known neurogenic transcription factors are globally reduced in u0126-treated animals, which indicates that neurogenesis is disrupted by u <dig> fig.  <dig> u <dig> treatment results in a global decrease in neurogenic transcription factors. mrna in situ expression of nvath-like , nvsoxb , and nvasha  in control embryos treated with in 1/3× artificial seawater  with  <dig>  % dimethyl sulfoxide . expression of nvath-like , nvsoxb , and nvasha  in animals treated with 15 μm u <dig> in 1/3× asw with  <dig>  % dmso. embryos were classified and quantified as the percent having normal expression, weak expression, or no expression. refer to key in figure for classification of phenotypes. the phenotypic class with the highest percentage of embryos is indicated. all embryo images are of early gastrula stage. the main figure panels are ectodermal focal planes of lateral views with the presumptive oral side to the left. the insets show deeper focal planes used to confirm embryonic stage



nvasha misexpression fails to rescue neurogenesis in u0126-treated animals
to test if u <dig> treatment impacted neurogenesis, treated animals were allowed to develop until a time equivalent to the late gastrula stage and screened for expression of the broadly expressed neural marker nvelav <dig> and previously identified nvasha neural target genes by mrna in situ hybridization. u <dig> treatment dramatically reduced expression of neural markers, such that they were essentially undetectable . two exceptions were nvlwamide-like  and nvanthorfamide, which showed staining in a few cells , but both were reduced compared to control dmso-treated animals. we conclude that treatment with u <dig> results in a nearly complete loss of embryonic neural marker expression.fig.  <dig> 
nvasha is insufficient to rescue neuronal loss resulting from u <dig> treatment. mrna in situ expression of each gene is indicated in control embryos raised in 1/3× artificial seawater  with  <dig>  % dimethyl sulfoxide  , compared to embryos treated with 15 μm u <dig> in 1/3× asw with  <dig>  % dmso , and compared to embryos injected with nvasha:venus mrna and treated with 15 μm u <dig> in 1/3× asw with  <dig>  % dmso . genes are referred to by either name or protein id number used in the nematostella genome database v <dig>  . embryos were classified and quantified as the percent having normal expression, weak expression, or no expression. the phenotypic class with the highest percentage of embryos is indicated. treatment with u <dig> strongly reduced all neural gene expression . misexpression of nvasha in u0126-treated animals was not sufficient to rescue neuronal loss induced by u <dig> treatment . all animals in panels a–g, a’–g’, and a–-g” are aboral ectodermal focal planes of 48 hours post fertilization embryos . embryos in panels h, h’, and h” are a lateral view with oral side facing towards the left



we next aimed to determine if loss of neural markers in u0126-treated animals could be rescued by misexpression of neurogenic transcription factors. nvsoxb and nvath-like act upstream of nvasha, both have much broader roles than nvasha in neurogenesis, and both are expressed in neural progenitor cells  <cit> . however, misexpression phenotypes are not reported for either of these genes. we were also concerned that over-activation of progenitor cell markers could result in a loss of neural markers due to an inability to transition from an undifferentiated to a differentiated state  <cit> . thus, observing no rescue with misexpression of either nvsoxb or nvath-like could represent a false negative neural phenotype. nvasha is expressed in differentiated cells, and misexpression of nvasha has already been shown to be sufficient to induce ectopic neural marker expression  <cit> . we injected in vitro transcribed nvasha:venus mrna and treated animals with u <dig>  surprisingly, we observed no rescue of the neural markers . to ensure that nvasha:venus behaves as previously reported  <cit> , we treated animals injected with nvasha:venus mrna with u <dig>  high levels of nvasha:venus were still detectable and localized to the nucleus . we conclude that nvasha is not sufficient to rescue neural marker expression in u0126-treated animals.

the failure of nvasha to rescue u0126-induced loss of neurogenesis might be a consequence of the reduced nvsoxb and nvath-like expression in u0126-treated animals. to address this hypotheses we took advantage of the previous observation that nvasha restores neural marker expression lost in animals with hyperactivated notch signaling even though nvsoxb and nvath-like remain strongly downregulated  <cit> . to compare the downregulation of nvsoxb and nvath-like induced by hyperactivation of notch to the downregulation observed in u0126-treated animals, we performed mrna in situ hybridization experiments in nvnotchicd:venus-injected animals . injection of nvnotchicd:venus mrna resulted in 83 % of animals showing no or weak nvsoxb expression and 88 % of animals showing no nvath-like expression . both genes were more severely reduced in nvnotchicd:venus-injected animals than they had been in u0126-treated animals . taken together with previous reports that nvasha rescues neuronal loss induced by notch hyperactivity without increasing nvsoxb or nvath-like expression, we argue that u <dig> disrupts neurogenesis in two ways. it inhibits the expression of the neurogenic transcription factors nvath-like, nvsoxb, and nvasha, and it disrupts a yet unknown pathway that is also required for nvasha to promote neural fates.

nvasha target genes likely represent multiple distinct neuronal subtypes
we wanted to confirm that nvasha regulates multiple neuronal subtypes. although nvasha is expressed in a subset of the nervous system, subtle differences in the expression domains of nvasha targets suggests that they describe distinct neural subtypes  <cit> . to test if nvasha regulates distinct neural subtypes we performed double fluorescent in situ hybridizations and created stable meganuclease-mediated transgenic reporters for two of the nvasha targets using an approximately 2000-base-pair genomic region immediately upstream of the start codon for both genes to drive expression of mcherry fluorescent protein   <cit> . we chose nvlwamide-like   and nvserum amyloid a-like   because these genes represent nvasha targets with overlapping but slightly different expression patterns during development, and both genes were strongly downregulated in the u <dig> microarray . both genes were expressed broadly throughout the aboral region of the embryo, but the nvlwamide-like expression domain extended more orally and encompassed a larger domain than that of nvserum amyloid a-like   <cit> . nvlwamide-like was expressed in more cells than nvserum amyloid a-like . double fluorescent mrna in situ hybridizations revealed that many of the nvserum amyloid a-like expressing neurons  were also positive for nvlwamide-like . however, there were many examples of nvlwamide-like-only-positive cells and few examples of nvserum amyloid a-like-only-positive cells . thus, it is likely that there are at least three molecularly distinct neural subtypes that require nvasha for development.fig.  <dig> 
nvasha regulates multiple neuronal subtypes. shown are three-dimensional projections of two juvenile polyps shown with the oral side towards the top of the image. a double fluorescent in situ hybridization of nvlwamide-like  and nvserum amyloid a-like  in a late gastrula stage embryo. b the transgenic line for nvlwamide::mcherry expression is shown. neural soma and neurites are observed throughout the body column and tentacles. ectodermal neurons with three projections are observed in the body column , which are not found in the other transgenic line. c the transgenic line for nvserum amyloid a-like::mcherry is shown. there are many fewer neurons compared to nvlwamide::mcherry, but characteristic neurons are present. the u-shaped neuron that has two orally projecting neurites  is specific to this transgenic line. both lines have neurons that are located just over the mesenteries and send projections orally and aborally in neural tracts overlaying the mesenteries . in all images, asterisks indicate relative position of mouth 



we next compared the neurons labeled in each transgene to determine if the neurite projections from nvserum amyloid a-like and nvlwamide-like neurons are similar or distinct. although there were a number of neurons with similar neurites that projected along the oral–aboral axis in each transgene , each transgene also labeled neurons with distinct morphologies . consistent with the mrna in situ hybridization results, the nvlwamide-like::mcherry labeled more cells than nvserum amyloid a-like::mcherry . interestingly, there were distinct cell types present in each line  that could be reproducibly identified in individual transgenic animals. although more extensive characterization is required for each of these transgenic lines, the fact that nvasha targets have distinct expression patterns and that neurons described by the transgenes of two nvasha targets display distinct morphologies support the conclusion that nvasha regulates multiple neuronal subtypes.

identification of  <dig> genes downregulated and  <dig> genes upregulated by u <dig> treatments
to determine if u <dig> regulates other potential neurogenic genes and to identify novel targets of mek signaling, we applied a forward molecular approach using a genome-wide expression microarray. zygotes were treated with u <dig> or dmso until late blastula stage. at that point mrna was extracted and used to generate labeled cdna, which was hybridized to a custom expression microarray  that represents  <dig>  predicted n. vectensis gene models  <cit> . the pearson’s correlation factor between biological replicates was mediocre , however,  <dig> genes were significantly  upregulated and  <dig> genes were significantly  downregulated in u0126-treated embryos . because our focus was to identify early embryonic patterning events, we screened the lists of genes to identify transcription factors, signaling molecules, and signaling modulators. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> genes that were downregulated and  <dig> genes that were upregulated by u <dig> . out of the  <dig> selected genes, the vast majority  possess strong orthology with members of various families of transcription factors . twenty-seven genes potentially encode ligands, modulators, or receptors of signaling pathways , and nine genes show similarities with adhesion molecules, metalloproteases, or rna binding proteins with described developmental functions in bilaterians  . to distinguish between previously published genes and newly identified ones, we used the best blast hit identification followed by “-like”. thus, with the exception of nvhes-like and nvath-like  <cit> , all gene names containing “-like” designate gene products described for the first time in this study.

identification of putative neural genes
neural genes are predicted to have a salt-and-pepper expression pattern, and thus determining the expression pattern of the  <dig> target genes would identify which genes exhibit salt-and-pepper expression associated with neural genes. we performed whole mount in situ hybridizations in the developing embryo at blastula stages  and at the end of gastrulation . we excluded  <dig> genes because their expression patterns are already described at the blastula stage, but we did include genes whose early expression patterns had not yet been described . we were able to obtain clones for  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> genes and synthesized anti-sense probes. all original publications corresponding to a given gene  can be found in additional file 7: table s <dig> and additional file 8: table s <dig>  our in situ screen revealed reproducible patterns for  <dig> of the  <dig> genes we screened. patterns could be grouped into one of three categories:  genes expressed in the animal hemisphere/presumptive endomesoderm of the blastula  ;  genes expressed in the vegetal hemisphere/aboral domain of the blastula  ; and  genes with the characteristic salt-and-pepper pattern consistent with being neural genes  . we found no link between genes that are expressed broadly in the animal and vegetal hemispheres and neurogenesis, and thus will not discuss these genes further here.fig.  <dig> u <dig> targets expressed in individual cells throughout the ectoderm. wild type salt-and-pepper gene expression analysis by in situ hybridization of genes differentially regulated by u <dig> treatments. all animals are either blastula  or gastrula  stages. all images are lateral views with the animal pole to the top. the insets correspond to surface views. antisense probes used as indicated. green stars in zd and zj indicate that this gene was upregulated under u <dig> conditions. all other genes were downregulated



genes expressed in individual cells throughout the ectoderm
the  <dig> genes expressed in individual cells of the presumptive ectoderm at the blastula stage or in ectodermal body wall at the end of gastrulation were nvsox <dig>  nvpea-like <dig>  nvcoup-like <dig> , nv-coup-like <dig>   <cit> , nvelav-like, nvemxlx, nvhd <dig>  nvtailless-like, nvvsx-like, nvgfi-like, nvsox10-like, nvhes-like <dig>  nvfoxq2-like <dig>  nvfoxd3-like, nvdkk-like <dig>  nvvegef-like <dig>  nvhox <dig>  and nvhd <dig> . eight genes . six genes  were expressed in 5– <dig> cells . for four genes , more than  <dig> cells were stained throughout the presumptive ectoderm at the blastula stage .

at the end of gastrulation, we observed gene expression for all above-mentioned genes in individual cells . however, the localization and number of stained cells varied considerably. the only gene that appeared to be expressed in individual cells throughout the entire ectoderm  was nvhes-like <dig> , which is reminiscent of a previously reported gene, nvasha  <cit> . nvsox <dig> and nvcoup-like <dig>  were also expressed in a salt-and-pepper manner throughout all ectodermal domains, except the pharyngeal ectoderm. the largest group of genes  was detected in the body wall ectodermal as well as the sub-apical and apical domains . cells expressing nvfoxd3-like and nvdkk3-like <dig>  were detected in the oral and body wall ectoderm as well as the sub-apical pole domains; however, nvsox10-like, nvfoxq2-like <dig>  and nvvegf-like were only detected in the body wall ectoderm and sup-apical domain . the genes with the most restricted expression domain were nvpea3-like, nvgfi-like, and nvhox <dig>  which were expressed in individual cells either within a circumferential territory  or in a patch within the body wall ectoderm , respectively. the variable expression patterns suggest that many of these genes are putatively expressed in distinct subsets of neurons, while a few broadly expressed genes might play larger roles during neural development.

temporal gene expression analysis of salt-and-pepper genes
in situ hybridization provides crucial spatial information about gene expression but cannot be used quantitatively to determine the presence of maternal transcripts or zygotic upregulation of a given gene. however, this information is crucial for the design of functional studies, to predict potential genetic interactions, and to build gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in order to determine the temporal deployment of putative neural genes during early embryogenesis, we performed fine-scale quantitative reverse transcription pcr  on rna/cdna that was sampled from unfertilized eggs and every 2–4 h during embryogenesis up to the late gastrula stage  additional file 10: figure s <dig>  we analyzed  <dig> salt-and-pepper genes identified both in this and in previous studies, including the known neural genes such as nvath-like and nvasha  <cit> . five salt-and-pepper genes  were detectable in zygotes, indicating that they are maternal genes . however, it is not yet clear what the significance of these genes is because none of these genes have broad expression patterns that might indicate a key early role for them in neurogenesis. the majority of salt-and-pepper genes, including the known neural regulators nvath-like and nvasha, are not components of the maternally contributed mrnas, which suggests that the earliest neural fates are induced in the embryo. as a group, the salt-and-pepper genes display a similar temporal deployment. the earliest zygotically regulated genes are nvath-like , followed by nvhes <dig> , nvfoxd <dig>  nvsox10-like , nvfoxq2-like <dig>  and nvsox <dig> , and then the bulk of genes  are upregulated at either 18– <dig> hpf  or 20– <dig> hpf . our temporal analysis demonstrated two key aspects. nvath-like, which is the first neural gene to respond to treatment with dapt and is thought to be the earliest acting neural gene  <cit> , is in fact upregulated prior to other known neural genes. second, the salt-and-pepper genes all showed strong upregulation between  <dig> and  <dig> hpf. the upregulation of genes is continuous in that different genes are upregulated at different times throughout the 10– <dig> hpf window. this argues that once salt-and-pepper gene expression is initiated there is a steady increase in the expression of distinct salt-and-pepper genes. additionally, temporal differences in expression might reflect a hierarchal organization for their functions. the later concept is supported by the observation that nvath-like  is detected much earlier than nvasha, which is expressed in differentiated neurons  <cit> .

nvfgfra does not regulate salt-and-pepper gene expression in the embryo
erk-mediated fgf signaling can be inhibited by treatment with u <dig> in nematostella  <cit> , and the nvfgfra receptor is expressed broadly in the embryonic ectoderm, which makes it a likely candidate responsible for the u <dig> neural phenotype and/or responsible for regulating some of the newly identified salt-and-pepper genes. we tested if nvfgfra might have an early neural phenotype by injecting the previously described nvfgfra mo into embryos  <cit>  and scoring for changes in nvath-like, nvasha, and the other  <dig> genes with salt-and-pepper gene expression identified in the u <dig> microarray. qpcr analysis comparing control mo and nvfgrra mo revealed that none of the salt-and-pepper genes responded to changes in nvfgfra levels . these data suggest nvfgfra signaling is not the u <dig> target responsible for the loss of salt-and-pepper expressed genes in the early gastrula. however, there is a maternal contribution of nvfgfra signaling genes  <cit> . to confirm that this fgf signaling was unlikely the source of the neural phenotype, we allowed morphant animals to grow to  <dig> hpf at 17 °c. in parallel, we allowed wild-type animals to grow until  <dig> hpf, when they are approximately at the late blastula/early gastrula stage. animals were then treated with u <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf. this treatment regimen allows for the maternal action of fgf components, thus mimicking a potential flaw in the nvfgfra morphant approach. qpcr analysis of nvasha and nvfgfra  demonstrated that nvfgfra mo effectively inhibited known targets, but not nvasha . we saw similar results with su <dig> treatment . however, u <dig> treatment resulted in a strong reduction in all genes assayed . these data argue that fgf signaling is not the source of the neural phenotype. thus, although the neural phenotype observed in u0126-treated animals is robust, it is still unclear what signaling pathway targeted by u <dig> regulates salt-and-pepper gene expression in the embryonic ectoderm.fig.  <dig> 
nvfgfra does not regulate u0126-dependent salt-and-pepper gene expression. relative fold change calculated from quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of triplicate injections of the nvfgfra morpholino  or a control mo is graphed. broadly expressed genes, nvsfrp1/ <dig>  nvotxc, and nvfgfra, are included as controls. the remaining genes are the salt-and-pepper expressed genes identified by the u <dig> microarray. the red box indicates a region  that was defined as the cut off for a significant change in expression. error bars represent standard error



nvasha regulates a small subset of the salt-and-pepper genes
we next wondered if nvasha acted to regulate any of the u <dig> target genes. based on the role of proneural genes in other animals we hypothesized that nvasha might act upstream of or suppress expression of subsets of the salt-and-pepper expressed u <dig> targets. nvasha was knocked down or overexpressed using the previously described nvasha translation blocking mo and in vitro synthesized nvasha:venus mrna  <cit> . we assayed u <dig> salt-and-pepper target expression by qpcr after disruption of nvasha and confirmed any genes that showed a response to nvasha disruption by mrna in situ hybridization . we included six control genes. four negative controls  represented broadly expressed regional patterning genes unlikely to respond to changes in nvasha function  <cit> . two positive control genes, nvlwamide-like  and canalicular multispecific anion transporter , are both confirmed positive targets of nvasha  <cit>  and were both also downregulated in the u <dig> array .fig.  <dig>

we first assayed for positive targets of nvasha. overexpression of nvasha increased the expression of nvvsx-like, nvgfi-like, nvcoup-like <dig>  nvsox <dig>  and nvtailless-like . however, nvvsx-like expression was weakly upregulated following injection of nvasha:venus mrna , but nvvsx-like was the only upregulated gene that decreased after nvasha knockdown by mo injection . these data argue that nvasha is necessary and sufficient for the expression of nvvsx-like . nvasha was sufficient but not necessary to regulate nvtailless-like in the early gastrula. overexpression of nvasha increased the expression of nvtailless-like . however, nvtailless expression was not dependent on nvasha, as its expression level was not decreased in nvasha morphants . nvgfi-like, nvcoup-like <dig>  and nvsox <dig> also all showed increases in expression following injection of nvasha mrna . however, injection of nvasha mo also resulted in increased expression of all three genes . because reciprocal phenotypes are not observed between mrna-injected and mo-injected animals, and both morphant and overexpression phenotypes were similar, it is unclear if changes in expression of nvcoup-like <dig>  nvsox <dig>  and nvgfi-like reflect normal nvasha activity. thus, we exclude these genes as targets of nvasha until nvasha mutant analysis can confirm that they are downstream of nvasha in the early gastrula. we conclude that nvvsx-like is a positive target of nvasha.

we next investigated the  <dig> genes, nvath-like, nvemxlx, nvhes-like <dig>  nvsox10-like, nvpaxa, nvgcm, nvgfi-like, nvhd <dig>  nvcoup-like <dig>  and nvelav <dig>  that displayed changes in expression consistent with being putative negative targets of nvasha. nvhd <dig> and nvcoup-like <dig> expression was reduced in nvasha-overexpressing animals, but no change in either gene was observed in nvasha morphants . these data suggest that although nvasha is sufficient to suppress nvhd <dig> and nvcoup-like <dig>  it does not likely regulate these genes during embryonic stages. nvath-like, nvemxlx, nvhes-like <dig>  nvsox10-like, nvpaxa, nvgcm, nvgfi-like, and nvelav <dig> showed increased expression at early gastrula stages in nvasha morphant animals , which suggests that they might be negative targets of nvasha. only nvath-like and nvemxlx showed reciprocal changes in expression in nvasha gain and loss of function . we were only able to confirm the changes in nvath-like expression by mrna in situ hybridization . in situ hybridizations with the nvemxlx probe on wild-type embryos often took >2 weeks to develop, and even then it was only detectable in very few cells and in only a few of the animals, arguing that it is expressed at low levels and that mrna in situ hybridization is not sensitive enough to verify this gene. relative expression strength can be inferred by the qt value obtained for any given gene during qpcr analysis. essentially, qt values above  <dig> are often associated with genes that are not expressed. we consistently obtained qt values of 32– <dig> for nvemxlx, arguing that it is in fact very weakly expressed. although we could not confirm nvemxlx by mrna in situ hybridization, it is likely a negative target of nvasha because it reproducibly showed reciprocal changes in expression in response to an increase or decrease in nvasha function . the remaining putative negative targets did not show reduced expression levels in nvasha:venus mrna-injected animals, and with exception to nvsox10-like, their increased expression in nvasha morphant animals could not be confirmed by mrna in situ hybridization . the increased expression of nvelav <dig> in nvasha morphants was somewhat surprising, because it has already been shown to be a positive target of nvasha when assayed at later stages  <cit> . however, nvasha only regulates a subset of nvelav1-positive neurons , and thus we suspect that nvasha does not play a significant, if any, role in nvelav <dig> regulation at this early time point. we conclude that nvath-like, nvemxlx, and nvsox10-like are normally suppressed by nvasha at embryonic stages, and that nvasha is sufficient to suppress expression of nvath-like and nvemxlx but not nvsox10-like.

discussion
preliminary gene regulatory network and model describing nvasha-dependent neurogenesis in the embryonic ectoderm
based on previous observations and data presented here, we propose a model for and preliminary gene regulatory network describing nvasha-dependent neurogenesis in the early embryonic ectoderm of nematostella . based on u <dig> phenotypes, we hypothesize that one or more not yet identified kinase signaling cascade acting through mek provides a global cue that is necessary for neural fates. it is not yet clear if all cells are competent to respond to this cue. however, it appears that the number of competent cells is greater than the number of cells that become neuralized, because evidence suggests that notch signaling integrates the global cue to restrict a subset of cells to become nvath-like- and nvsoxb-positive neural progenitor cells . interestingly, we saw no evidence that either nvnotch or nvdelta were affected by u <dig> treatment , which suggests that the refining activity of nvnotch is independently controlled. it is not clear which, if either, transcription factor  is nearer the top of the neural cascade. nvsoxb is expressed maternally , and both genes appear to be upregulated at approximately the same time in normal development . however, increased nvath-like expression accumulates before nvsoxb increases in animals with inhibited notch activity  <cit> . additionally, nvsoxb and nvasha co-expression can be observed in post-mitotic cells, whereas nvath-like and nvasha double-positive cells are never observed  <cit> . post-mitotic neurons do not appear to express nvath-like and they lose nvsoxb <dig> expression. lineage-specific pro-differentiation neural markers such as nvasha are not expressed until post-mitotic stages. the observation that nvasha suppresses nvath-like expression suggests that one of its functions is to inhibit neural progenitor identity. this is contrary to reported interactions for nvath-like and nvasha  <cit> . however, the previous study assessed phenotypes at later time points, and thus cannot account for potential phenotypes arising due to sustained loss of a key neurogenic gene causing system-wide defects. here we look closer at the onset of neurogenesis, which provides less time for potential nonspecific phenotypes to arise. certainly further efforts are needed to clarify this point. nvasha also promotes the expression of distinct individual neuronal subtype markers. the mechanism by which subtype markers are regulated is still unclear, but it is likely that regionally expressed oral–aboral patterning genes and the temporal window in which neural progenitors/neurons are born likely contribute to neural patterning  <cit> .fig.  <dig> model of nvasha-dependent embryonic neurogenesis. a model describing nvasha-dependent neurogenesis at early gastrula stage. boxes represent indicted cell types. solid regulatory lines represent published observations, and dashed lines represent likely regulatory interactions. b biotapestry diagram of grn



it is not clear how only a subset of the nvsoxb and nvath-like double-positive cells give rise to nvasha-expressing cells. nvsoxb, nvath-like, and nvasha expression do not appear to be restricted to a distinct spatial domain  <cit> . one hypothesis is that progenitors give rise to different daughter cells with distinct identities, and that nvasha defines one such identity. this idea would be consistent with temporal patterning observed for neural progenitor lineages in drosophila  <cit> . alternatively, the time and position at which a progenitor is born might determine its identity and subsequently the identity of the neurons it generates  <cit> . regardless, functional studies support a much broader role for the progenitor marker nvsoxb, and suggest that some additional mechanism is acting to restrict nvasha expression to a subset of the nvsoxb-positive progenitors.

additional putative neural genes identified here
we have identified  <dig> new genes expressed early  stages that are candidate neural regulators or neural subtype markers. the earliest expressed gene in our temporal analysis was nvath-like, which had been previously identified as an early-acting neurogenic gene. two genes turned on slightly after nvath-like were nvhes3-like and nvfoxd3-like. previous studies suggest that nvhes3-like is not sufficient to regulate neurogenesis at this stage, but it cannot yet be ruled out as a neural regulator because efficient nvhes3-like knockdowns are not yet reported  <cit> . the next two genes to be expressed were nvsox <dig> and nvfoxq2-like. again, the broad expression of nvsox <dig> was similar to that of nvfoxd3-like and suggests that it may act broadly to regulate neurogenesis. nvfoxq2-like genes displayed limited expression in the aboral region, suggesting their neurogenic potential is limited to neurons arising from that domain. the late-onset genes displayed both broad and restricted expression patterns, suggesting that at least some of these genes have roles regulating distinct neural subtypes. this is supported by the inclusion of nvasha as a late-onset gene. however, it must be noted that neurogenesis in nematostella is a continuous process and late onset alone is not sufficient to suggest that a gene acts at the later steps in neurogenesis. regardless, we have identified a number of putative neural genes, and future work will allow us to both determine which genes are definitively neural, and where each gene fits into the regulatory networks describing the earliest born neural subtypes in nematostella.

neural induction in nematostella
mapk/mek activity is required for the expression of key neural progenitor markers, suggesting that it might be a component of neural induction in nematostella. loss of neurogenesis following treatment with u <dig> implies that a positive neurogenic cue is disrupted by u <dig> treatment. it is tempting to speculate that fgf signaling may be responsible for neural induction, because fgf is a positive regulator of neural induction during vertebrate development  <cit>  and mek activity has been described to be downstream of fgf signaling in other systems. however, we report no phenotype when the broadly expressed nvfgfra receptor was knocked down . however, we still suspect that some mapk signaling through mek is necessary for neurogenesis. α–phospho-erk staining was detected throughout the embryonic ectoderm, and this staining was reduced in u0126-treated animals . recently, mapk signaling was shown to positively promote neurogenesis in salamander animal cap explants, in part by inhibiting bmp responsiveness due to decreased smad <dig> expression  <cit> . however, expression of the putative neural marker nvgata is not sensitive to the level of nvbmp2/ <dig> in nematostella gastrula  <cit> . thus, the potential mechanism by which mapk/mek signaling promotes neural fates is not yet understood in nematostella.

possibly multiple neural inductive events during nematostella neurogenesis
multiple observations raise the hypothesis that distinct mechanisms may be necessary for neurogenesis in different spatiotemporal windows in nematostella. first, nvbmp2/ <dig> does not appear to impact neurogenesis at early embryonic stages, but expression of neural markers such as nvelav <dig> and nvasha are sensitive to the levels of nvbmp2/ <dig> and nvbmp5/ <dig> in planulae  <cit> . second, nvasha was not detected in u0126-treated embryos at early gastrula stages, but animals that were allowed to continue developing in the presence of u <dig> begin to show nvasha expression, albeit in very few cells . third, very few nvlwamide-positive and nvanthorfamide-positive cells were able to form in u0126-treated animals, which suggests that a subset of nvlwamide and nvanthorfamide neurons may be u0126-independent. the potential for multiple neural programs acting in nematostella suggest that efforts to isolate specific neurons born in unique spatiotemporal windows as well developing conditional alleles to investigate later time points in isolation will improve our understanding of neurogenesis in nematostella.

patterning genes identified in the uo <dig> microarray
in addition to the genes with a neural-like expression pattern, our forward molecular approach identified ~ <dig> genes downstream of mek that were expressed at the animal pole, including genes expressed in the presumptive endomesoderm and genes expressed at the aboral pole. these data suggest that mapk acts broadly in the embryo to regulate germ layer specification as well as regional identities associated with axial patterning. uo <dig> treatment has been reported to suppress formation of the apical tuft at the aboral pole of the larva, likely via inhibition of nvfgfra-mediated mapk signaling  <cit> . however, early embryonic patterning of the aboral domain has been largely understudied, and preliminary data suggest that distinct mechanisms act at early  and late  stages of aboral patterning  <cit> . additional fgf receptors and ligands are detected in the oral domain of nematostella, suggesting that fgf-mediated mapk signaling normally regulates u <dig> targets identified that display oral/animal pole expression  <cit> . however, targeted gene-specific knockdowns will be important to further determine exact mechanisms by which mek activity impacts aboral and/or germ layer specification.

CONCLUSIONS
our data indicate mapk signaling is necessary for neurogenesis in the embryonic ectoderm of nematostella. our work also built upon previous observations to improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cnidarian neurogenesis and described two transgenes that describe distinct neural subtypes in nematostella. lastly, we identified ~ <dig> signaling molecules and transcription factors that act downstream of mek in mapk signaling. future characterization of the genes will provide critical cues about the early patterning mechanisms acting during nematostella development, which will be important to allow improved understanding about the origin and evolution of neurogenesis, axial patterning, and endomesoderm specification.
