BACKGROUND
accurate laboratory diagnosis of typhoid fever is mandatory for early antibiotic therapy, which reduces both mortality and morbidity. around  <dig>  million cases of typhoid fever with  <dig>  deaths occur in low and middle income countries in  <dig>  <cit> . this is probably an under estimate due to the lack of availability of suitable diagnostic test and absence of disease surveillance in developing countries. clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever is also confusing due to the overlapping of symptoms with other febrile illnesses such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis etc.  <cit> .

isolation of salmonella enterica serovar typhi  by blood culture provides the most conclusive diagnosis of typhoid and is generally considered as the gold standard for validation of new diagnostic assays  <cit> . but since it suffers from poor sensitivity , use of blood culture as gold standard is challenging for evaluation of more sensitive molecular-based assays  <cit> . additionally microbiological culture requires 7 days for reporting negative result  <cit> . culture of bone marrow aspirates is relatively more sensitive  than blood culture but rarely practiced as the procedure is invasive  <cit> .

over the last decade, s. typhi dna detection by direct blood pcr has shown most promising result for typhoid diagnosis. of different genes  targeted in typhoid diagnostic pcr assays  <cit> , the flagellin gene  of s. typhi was commonly used due to its unique nucleotide sequences in hypervariable region vi of the gene which differ from those in other salmonella serovars . use of nested pcr  and real-time quantitative pcr  significantly improved the detection rate compared to that of conventional pcr   <cit> . but, these pcr diagnostic molecular methods could not be implemented into practice since issues like diagnostic utility of these techniques was neither demonstrated nor standardized under field situation in resource poor countries  <cit> .

keeping the background information in mind, this study was undertaken to determine the performance abilities of flic-d based direct pcr assays for typhoid diagnosis both under laboratory condition and field situation. here we report the results on actual occurrence of the disease among hospital attending clinically diagnosed typhoid fever  children in kolkata by using c-pcr, n-pcr and taqman-based q-pcr.

study population
to assess the performances of direct pcrs for typhoid diagnosis under field situation, blood samples were collected from the study children of 2- <dig> years of age, attending the outpatient department  of dr. b. c. roy memorial post graduate institute of pediatric sciences, kolkata, india in  <dig>  the children, who presented with high fever  for ≥3 days and clinically diagnosed as typhoid fever, were included as study subjects irrespective of history of antibiotic intake and severity/duration of the disease.

sample collection
blood samples  were collected aseptically from the study children and immediately inoculated into bactecpeds plus bottles  for microbiological culture. total dna was extracted from 200 μl of citrated-blood samples from the study children using qiaamp dna blood mini kit  following manufacturer’s instruction. the extracted dna was re-suspended in 200 μl of elution buffer for use as template in pcr assays.

ethical consideration
the present study was reviewed and approved by the institutional ethical committee of niced . blood samples were collected from the febrile children after receiving written informed consent from their parents or guardians.

microbiological culture
the inoculated bactec bottles were incubated at 37 °c for 7 days in bactec  <dig> system  and subcultures were made on the macconkey and nutrient agars  when the system showed alarm signal during the incubation period. non-lactose fermenting smooth colonies was tested by gram stains and other biochemical tests for salmonella following standard protocol  <cit> . confirmed identification of the s. typhi was done by slide and tube agglutination using salmonella o, h and vi factor antisera . the result was read as negative if there was no growth after 7 days of incubation.

primers and probe used for pcr assays
for q-pcr, the primers  and probe  were designed from the flic-d gene of s. typhi ct <dig>  using primer-express software  and synthesized by outsourcing from eurogentec . similar primers have been used for c-pcr and second round of n-pcr to compare the analytical and diagnostic performances of all assays. published primers  were used for the first round of n-pcr  <cit> .

pcr assays for detection of s. typhi
c-pcr
the c-pcr was carried out in 25 μl volume comprising of 1x pcr buffer, 1u of taq dna polymerase, 250 μm of each dntps ,  <dig>  μm of each primer  and 5 μl of template dna. amplification was carried out in a geneamp pcr system  <dig>  using the thermal condition of a pre-denaturation at 94 °c for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 1 min, annealing at 60 °c for 1 min, extension at 72 °c for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °c for 7 min. suitable positive and negative controls were used.

n-pcr
the first round of n-pcr was carried out using the pcr mix same as it was used for c-pcr, except the external primers . the thermal cycling condition used was a pre-denaturation at 94 °c for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °c for 1 min, annealing at 52 °c for 1 min, extension at 72 °c for 1 min and final extension at 72 °c for 7 min. for the second round of n-pcr similar primers and thermal conditions were used like the c-pcr.

q-pcr
the taqman-based q-pcr was performed in 25 μl reaction mixtures containing 1x master mix  ,  <dig>  μm of each primers ,  <dig>  μm probe , 1x ipc mix , 1x ipc dna  and 5 μl of template dna. amplification was carried out in a steponeplus real-time pcr system  using the pre-incubation at 95 °c for 10 min and two steps cycle  of denaturation at 95 °c for 15 s, annealing and extension at 60 °c for 1 min. the universal exogenous q-pcr internal positive control  was used to distinguish true target negatives and false negatives due to pcr inhibition, incorrect pipetting or erroneous cycling conditions.

sequencing of pcr products
the amplicons of three pcr assays were purified by qiaquick pcr purification kit  for direct sequencing using a  <dig> dna analyzer , and analyzed by basic local alignment search tool  database search program of the national center for biotechnology information .

determination of analytical specificity and sensitivity
analytical specificities of the three pcr assays were determined by using genomic dna of different bacterial strains . genomic dna was extracted using the qiaamp dna mini kit  following manufacturer’s instructions. the analytical sensitivities of the three pcrs were determined following the methods shown in fig.  <dig>  dna concentrations were converted to dna copy numbers using the formula; mol/g x molecules/mol = molecules/g via a dna copy number calculator available at http://www.uri.edu/research/gsc/resources/cndna.html.fig.  <dig> flow chart showing methods for determination of analytical sensitivities of c-pcr, n-pcr and q-pcr under laboratory condition. three  categories of extracted dna were used to determine the dna detection limits. bacterial culture showing one od  is equivalent to 8 ×  <dig> organisms/ml



determination of diagnostic performances of pcr assays
diagnostic performances of c-pcr, n-pcr and q-pcr assays were evaluated using dna templates extracted from citrated-blood samples of cdtf cases designated as study subjects.

statistical analysis
the sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values , negative predictive values , positive likelihood ratio , negative likelihood ratio  and efficiencies of the pcr methods were calculated using the computer package spss for windows  considering cdtf cases positive by any of the diagnostic assay methods as true positives. the k-statistics was used to measure the agreement between n-pcr and q-pcr assays as described previously  <cit> . mcnemer  test and student’s t-test were used to determine the significance of difference between the test systems. a p-value of < <dig>  was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
study subjects
a total of  <dig> hospital attending febrile children  with cdtf were included in this study during  <dig>  median age of the patient was 5 years  and median duration of fever was 8 days . on enquiring to the accompanying parents, it was noted that  <dig>  cases had history of prior antibiotic intake,  <dig>  did not have any antibiotic, and  <dig>  were not sure about their status of antibiotic intakes.

twenty-nine children  of  <dig> study subjects were included as negative controls. they were either laboratory confirmed non-typhoid cases  or negative by all assay methods . among  <dig> non-typhoid cases, eight had dengue fever , five were positive for malaria parasites , seven had blood culture positive for bacteria other than s. typhi, e.g, s. paratyphi a , acinetobacter spp. , pseudomonas spp., klebsiella spp. .

determination of analytical specificity and sensitivity
presence of visible bands , confirmed by sequencing, was considered as positive results in the c-pcr and n-pcr assays. both the assays yielded negative result for any bacteria other than s. typhi . in q-pcr, the cycle threshold  value is the number of cycles required at a specific point when fluorescence rises prominently above the background noise. low ct values  were obtained in s. typhi, which increased to > <dig> in other bacteria suggesting 100 % specificity of the q-pcr assay . for blood samples, when the ct was > <dig>  sequencing of the amplicons yielded dimers. in contrast, when ct was ≤ <dig>  the amplicon sequences matched with flic-d gene of s. typhi indicating positive blood samples. hence, we considered a cutoff ct of ≤ <dig> as positive result for blood samples.

dna detection limits of the three pcr assays were determined using serial dilutions  bacterial dna from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> pg/reaction . the detection limit of c-pcr was found 120 pg/reaction , while n-pcr and q-pcr assays could detect as few as  <dig>  pg/reaction  .fig.  <dig>

since the detection limit of c-pcr assay was found 104-fold higher than the other two pcr assays, and showed negative results for all clinical samples, c-pcr was not evaluated further for typhoid diagnosis. n-pcr and q-pcr assays using categories  and  as dna templates  showed that detection limits of both the n-pcr and q-pcr were  <dig> organisms/ml , which corresponded to 10− <dig> dilution of s. typhi culture . in case of spiked blood samples, the detection limits of both n-pcr and q-pcr were  <dig> organisms/ml , which corresponded to 10− <dig> dilution .table  <dig> analytical sensitivities of n-pcr and q-pcr using dna extracted from different dilutions of s. typhi cultures and spiked blood samples

discussion
introduction of pcr into routine diagnostics has rapidly gained a pivotal role for diagnosis of a wide range of diseases, supplanting other conventional microbiological methods. this is true for typhoid fever also, where low bacterial count in the peripheral blood due to their intracellular existence in the reticulo endothelial system does not allow easy diagnosis by blood culture  <cit> . recently loop-mediated isothermal dna amplification  assay has been introduced for typhoid diagnosis which is still under investiagtion  <cit> .

among pcr assays, the q-pcr has been well recognized to offer several advantages over n-pcr including quantification of bacterial load. when both the assays were compared, the q-pcr was reported to show comparable or better result than n-pcr in many infectious diseases, but no such data was available for typhoid fever .

in this study, the analytical and diagnostic performances of q-pcr and n-pcr assays targeting the flic-d gene of s. typhi were evaluated for typhoid diagnosis. since same experimental conditions were used for both the methods, discrepancies in results could be attributed to the differences in detection limits of the respective method. in earlier reports, ct values of ≤ <dig> or ≤ <dig> were regarded as positive for bacterial culture, and ct values of ≤ <dig> or ≤ <dig> were positive for clinical samples  <cit> . similarly, based on the analytical assay results we have considered ct values of ≤ <dig> and ≤ <dig> as positive for bacterial cultures and blood samples respectively.

the analytical specificities of the three pcr assays were found to be 100 % . analytical sensitivities of both n-pcr and q-pcr assays were similar  . but, there was a 10-fold reduction in detection limit when spiked blood sample was compared with the bacterial culture in both n-pcr and q-pcr . presence of human dna or potential pcr inhibitors might be responsible for the decreased sensitivity of the spiked blood pcr. detection limit of n-pcr was reported  <dig>  pg  using blood dna spiked with bacterial dna as samples in earlier study  <cit> . reported detection limits of q-pcr were 1– <dig> dna copies/reaction cloned in a plasmid vector and  <dig> organisms/ml in spiked blood samples  <cit> .

low isolation rate  of s. typhi among the study population indicated that blood culture did no longer reflect the true burden of the disease in a region and therefore should not be used as standard method. hence we have used cdtf cases positive by any of the diagnostic assay methods as true positives and the sensitivity of q-pcr  was found to be higher than n-pcr , but the difference was not statistically significant . pcr-based molecular diagnostics has been adopted as gold standard not only for typhoid, but also for other infectious diseases  <cit> . in this study, the lr+ and lr- of q-pcr were ∞ and  <dig>  which indicated the potential clinical utility of q-pcr for typhoid diagnosis. likelihood ratios  are used to measure and express diagnostic accuracy. lr+ value of ≥ <dig> means that a positive test is good at ruling in a diagnosis, and lr- value of ≤ <dig>  indicates that a negative test is good at ruling out a diagnosis  <cit> .

for typhoid diagnosis, flic-d-based pcr assays has been evaluated by other researchers, who have reported ≥80 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity of n-pcr  <cit> . the sensitivity and specificity of q-pcr were found  <dig> and 100 % in a study from indonesia  <cit> . one study from nepal showed limited sensitivity  of q-pcr targeting a fimbrial-like adhesin gene of s. typhi  <cit> . in this study, few culture confirmed typhoid fever cases showed negative results by n-pcr  and q-pcr . similar observation was also reported earlier by other researchers  <cit> . this may be due to the low number of bacteria in the patient’s blood below the detection limit of pcr assays.

although higher copy number  of bacterial dna was observed by q-pcr assay in blood culture negative cases , the higher rate  of antibiotic intake among the study population might lead to negative results in blood culture mehod . in this study, the difference in dna copy number obtained between blood culture positive and negative typhoid fever cases was not significant ; whereas one earlier study reported significant difference  between the two categories   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates for the first time that taqman-based q-pcr assay performs more favorably than n-pcr for direct detection of s. typhi dna in blood samples. despite of relatively high cost of q-pcr, it may be considered as the method of choice due to its rapidity, less chances of contamination, availability in a single-tube format and ability to obtain reproducible and quantitative results.
