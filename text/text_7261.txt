BACKGROUND
dendritic cells  are among the first antigen presenting cells encountering bacteria at mucosal surfaces and play an important role in maintenance of regular homeostasis in the intestine. stimulation of dc with e.g. tlr agonists leads to activation and maturation of dc by activation of nf-κb and mitogen-activated protein kinase  family members  <cit> . this results in a rapid production of costimulatory molecules, cytokines and pro-inflammatory mediators that affect t-cell differentiation, for instance.

we identified escherichia coli mpk, a commensal e. coli strain which induces colitis in genetically predisposed hosts and bacteroides vulgatus mpk which does not elicit colitis and even prevents the colitis caused by e. coli mpk  <cit> . stimulation of bone marrow derived dendritic cells  with e. coli <cit>  or lipopolysaccharide  at high concentration  <cit>  induced tnf-α, il- <dig> and il- <dig> secretion and expression of activation-markers, whereas stimulation with b. vulgatus or  <cit>  lps at low concentrations  <cit>  only led to secretion of il- <dig> and dc were driven to a semimature state with low expression of activation-markers. those semimature dc were nonresponsive to subsequent tlr stimulation in terms of maturation and tnf-α but not il- <dig> production  <cit> . moreover, the low positive expression of activation surface marker like e.g. cd <dig> on semimature dc, was not overcome by a subsequent stimulus via tlr <dig>  <cit> . this might contribute to the reduced activation of t-cells by semimature dc  <cit>  as binding of the cd <dig> ligand  on naïve t-cells to cd <dig> is a crucial signal for generation of effective cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses  <cit> . cd <dig> ligation results in upregulation of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> as well as mhc molecules on dc. additionally, the expression of adhesion molecules icam- <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit>  is upregulated and survival of dc is supported by cd <dig> ligation  <cit> . furthermore, cd <dig> ligation of mature dc results in secretion of proinflammatory cytokines e.g. il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit>  <cit> .

il- <dig> plays an important role in t-cell polarization by promoting th- <dig> responses. its bioactive heterodimer il-12p <dig> consists of a p <dig> and p <dig> subunit, which are encoded by different genes and therefore independently regulated. il-12p <dig> can also form homodimers  which were shown to inhibit il-12p <dig> mediated immune responses  <cit> .

mitogen-activated protein kinase  signal transduction pathways play a crucial role in many aspects of immune mediated inflammatory responses  <cit> . the mapk erk, jnk and p <dig> are important regulators of host immune responses to e.g. bacterial stimuli. extracellular stimuli induce phosphorylation of mapk–kinase-kinase  which in turn phosphorylate mkk. specific mkk are necessary to phosphorylate and activate mapk, which results in activation of downstream kinases and transcription factors  <cit> . the products of inflammatory genes include e.g. cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules which promote recruitment of immunocompetent cells to inflammatory sites. additionally, the mapk p <dig> enhances the mrna stability of many proinflammatory cytokines, e.g. il- <dig>  tnf-α or il- <dig>  <cit> .

within the present study we analyzed the effects of dc semimaturation on cellular responses to cd <dig> ligation and showed that the semimature differentiation state of dc, induced by stimulation with b. vulgatus or lpslo can not be overcome by cd <dig> ligation.

cd <dig> ligation
to determine the effects of cd <dig> ligation on dc cytokine production and expression of surface markers dc were restimulated using an agonistic anti-cd <dig> mab . therefore, dcs pretreated with e. coli, b. vulgatus or lps were harvested, washed twice and cultured at  <dig> x <dig> dc in the presence of 5 μg/ml anti-cd <dig> mab in dc culture medium at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  as a control, dcs were incubated with 5 μg/ml of the igm isotype control antibody . after 48 h, dc culture supernatants were harvested and analyzed for cytokine concentrations by elisa. the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> on the dc surface was determined by facs analysis.

for determination of cd <dig> expression of dc upon cd <dig> ligation the j558/lcd40l cell line was irradiated with 180 gy in a gammacell  <dig> elite®  prior to co-culture with dc. 5x <dig> j558l/cd40l cells were cultured with  <dig> x <dig> dc in dc culture medium for 48 h at 37°c, 5% co <dig>  dc were harvested and analyzed for expression of cd <dig> by facs.

RESULTS
cd <dig> ligation does not overcome dc semimaturation
stimulation of dc with b. vulgatus or lpslo  leads to induction of dc semimaturation  <cit>  whereas stimulation of immature dc with e. coli or lpshi  induces dc maturation. the semimature dc phenotype is characterized by tolerance towards a subsequent stimulation via tlr <dig> or tlr <dig> in terms of tnf-α and il-12p <dig> but not il- <dig> secretion and a low positive expression of costimulatory molecules like e.g. cd <dig>  cd <dig> cd <dig>  <cit> . herein we investigated whether cd <dig> ligation as a tlr independent dc activation signal can overcome the semimature dc phenotype and induce activation and maturation of semimature dc.

by stimulation of immature dc with b. vulgatus or lpslo we induced semimature dc, and by stimulation with e. coli or lpshi dc maturation was induced. secretion of il-12p <dig> , il-12p <dig>  and il- <dig>  was determined by elisa. cd <dig> ligation of semimature dc led to secretion of il-12p <dig> but not to secretion of the bioactive heterodimer il-12p <dig>  in contrast, cd <dig> ligation of mature dc resulted in significant enhanced secretion of il-12p <dig> as compared to cells treated with the anti-cd <dig> mab isotype control. mature dc revealed a high spontaneous production of il-12p <dig> which was only slightly enhanced by cd <dig> ligation . additionally, cd <dig> ligation of semimature dc resulted in increased levels of il- <dig> compared to immature dc. in mature dc which also showed a high spontaneous secretion rate of il- <dig> cd <dig> ligation only led to a slight further increase of il- <dig> production .

next, we investigated whether cd <dig> ligation can overcome the low positive expression of dc activation markers on semimature dc. therefore, we analysed the expression of cd <dig> , cd <dig> , and cd <dig>  on immature, mature and semimature dc upon cd <dig> ligation in comparison to mock cells or cells treated with the anti-cd <dig> mab isotype control by facs.

on semimature dc the expression of cd <dig> was slightly enhanced upon cd <dig> ligation, as compared to the control cells . however, in comparison to mature dc, in semimature dc the expression of cd <dig> was still significantly reduced after subsequent cd <dig> ligation  . analysis of the expression of cd <dig> on immature, semimature and mature dc upon cd <dig> ligation revealed a slight increase of cd <dig> expression in immature  and semimature dc . however, the expression levels of cd <dig> on semimature dc after cd <dig> ligation did not reach the expression levels of mature dc  .

the mhc class ii expression on immature, semimature and mature dc was slightly increased upon cd <dig> ligation. these changes, however, proved not to be statistically significant .

as anti-cd <dig> antibodies used for ligation assays and anti-cd <dig> antibodies used for facs analysis might compete for binding of cd <dig> we used the j558l/cd40l cell line to analyze the influence of cd <dig> ligation on the expression of cd <dig> itself on dc. in b. vulgatus treated semimature dc we found an increase of cd <dig> expression upon cd <dig> ligation . in lpslo treated semimature dc we observed a similar effect, however, the increase in cd <dig> expression was statistically not significant . interestingly, cd <dig> ligation of semimature dc did not lead to an increase of cd <dig> resulting in as high expression levels as on mature dc  .

in dc semimaturation cd40l induced p <dig> phosphorylation is inhibited
to analyze phosphorylation of the map kinase p <dig> in response to cd <dig> ligation, immature, semimature and mature dc were activated by cd <dig> ligation and pp <dig> levels were determined by western blotting. cd <dig> ligation of immature and mature dc resulted in phosphorylation of p <dig>  whereas in semimature dc p <dig> phosphorylation upon cd <dig> ligation slightly reduced .

to investigate the biological relevance of p <dig> map kinase activation we treated immature, semimature and mature dc with the p <dig> inhibitor sb <dig> prior to cd <dig> ligation. levels of il-12p <dig>  il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> were determined in cell culture supernatants by elisa .

inhibition of p <dig> had no influence on the cd40l induced secretion of il-12p <dig> by dc, independent of the maturation state . however, in mature dc the production of il-12p <dig> upon cd <dig> ligation was inhibited partially by sb <dig>  inhibition of p <dig> did not influence the il-12p <dig> expression pattern in immature or semimature dc as cd <dig> ligation did not induce any il-12p <dig> secretion in these cells . in mature dc, both spontaneous and cd40l induced il- <dig> secretion levels were partially reduced by inhibition of the p <dig> map kinase. in contrast, il- <dig> production of immature as well as semimature dc upon cd <dig> ligation was not significantly affected by inhibition of p <dig> .

in dc semimaturation erk suppresses cd40l induced il-12p <dig> production
to analyze the role of the extracellular signal regulated kinase  we used the erk inhibitor pd <dig>  upon cd <dig> ligation the inhibition of erk resulted in a significant increase of il-12p <dig> in immature and semimature dc but only a slight increase in mature dc . in contrast, inhibition of erk had not the ability to induce il-12p <dig> production in immature and semimature dc and resulted in only slightly enhanced il-12p <dig> secretion levels in mature dc . the cd40l induced il- <dig> production by dc was not affected by erk inhibition, independent of the maturation state . in line with this, analysis of perk levels upon cd <dig> ligation of immature, semimature and mature dc showed similar levels independent of the dc maturation state .

taken together, our data showed that the semimature differentiation state of dc, induced by stimulation with b. vulgatus or lpslo can not be overcome by cd <dig> ligation.

discussion
in order to clarify the impact of cd <dig> expression on the t-cell activation capacity of semimature dc, we examined the effect of cd <dig> ligation on immature, semimature and mature dc. semimature dc were induced by either stimulation with b. vulgatus or lps at low concentration , and are characterized by a low positive expression of costimulatory molecules like e.g. cd <dig>  secretion of only il- <dig>  and nonresponsiveness toward subsequent tlr activation  <cit> .

in brief, we showed that cd <dig> ligation does not overcome dc semimaturation in terms of expression of activation surface markers and results in production of only il- <dig> and il-12p <dig>  but not the bioactive form il-12p <dig>  the slightly reduced p <dig> phosphorylation levels in semimature dc as compared to mature dc might at least partially contribute to this effect. the expression of il-12p <dig> turned out to be limited by perk.

in line with other studies  <cit> , we observed that on mature dcs no significant further increase in the expression levels of the already highly expressed costimulatory molecules cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> could be triggered upon additional stimulation by cd <dig> ligation.

upon cd <dig> ligation immature and semimature dc expressed intermediate levels of cd <dig> cd <dig> and cd <dig>  but did not reach the expression level of mature dc. however, the intermediate expression of costimulatory molecules was not associated with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like il-12p <dig> 

it is known that immature dcs characterized by low expression levels of costimulatory molecules and lacking secretion of proinflammatory cytokines induce tolerance by promoting t-cell anergy, apoptosis or differentiation into treg cells via antigen presentation in the absence of costimulatory signals  <cit> . additionally, cd <dig> deficient dcs or dcs with a suppressed cd <dig> expression were shown to have a reduced potential to activate t-cell proliferation and polarization in th <dig> or th <dig> direction  <cit> . this effect might also contribute to the inhibited t-cell activation induced by the intermediate expression of costimulatory molecules on semimature lamina propria  dc of b. vulgatus monocolonized il-2−/− mice  <cit> . on the other hand it was shown that a high positive expression of costimulatory molecules in absence of pro-inflammatory mediators like e.g. tnf-α or il-12p <dig> favours t-cell tolerance and suppression of t-cell activation. this type of dc is mainly induced by autocrine or paracrine stimulation with inflammatory mediators like e. g. tnf-α  <cit> .

the cytokine secretion pattern upon cd <dig> ligation differed between immature/semimature dc and mature dc. in immature and semimature dc, cd <dig> ligation did not result in induction of il-12p <dig> secretion, in contrast to mature dc where cd <dig> ligation led to increased il-12p <dig> secretion. this is in line with other studies showing that tlr <dig> stimulation and cd <dig> ligation synergize in inducing il- <dig> p <dig> secretion  <cit> . the additive microbial priming signals are necessary to trigger the production of the il-12p <dig> subunit  <cit>  which was shown to be not induced by exclusive cd <dig> ligation  <cit> . additionally, these accessory stimuli have the potential to augment the cd <dig> expression on antigen presenting cells   <cit>  which results in a more effective cd <dig> ligation. however, dc primed with bacteroides vulgatus as a microbial stimulus do not secrete il-12p <dig> upon cd <dig> ligation. this might be one mechanism accounting for the tolerogenic effects of b. vulgatus in maintenance of intestinal homeostasis  <cit> . as porphyromonas gingivalis which is phylogenetically closely related to b. vulgatus signals mainly vial tlr <dig>  <cit> , this might be also the main receptor for recognition of b. vulgatus. in turn, tlr <dig> activation is reported to result in transcription of the p <dig> but not the p <dig> subunit of il-12p <dig>  <cit> . this might account for the induction of il-12p <dig> but not p <dig> upon stimulation of b. vulgatus primed dc via cd <dig> ligation. the production of il-12p <dig> in the absence of the p <dig> unit might result in the formation of il-12p <dig> homodimers which are known to act as potent antagonists at the il-12p <dig> receptor  <cit> . additionally, in il-12p <dig> transgenic mice th <dig> responses are significantly reduced suggesting that also in vivo p <dig> functions as an il- <dig> antagonist  <cit> .

upon cd <dig> ligation semimature dc produced significantly enhanced levels of il- <dig> but not tnf-α  or il-12p <dig>  this is in line with our previous studies showing a crucial role for il- <dig> in induction of dc semimaturation and tolerance  <cit> . this is interesting as the secretion of il- <dig> upon cd <dig> ligation by semimature dc might help to sustain the semimature differentiation state and influence the t-cell activation pattern. il- <dig> plays an important role in t-cell differentiation through two independent molecular mechanisms. first, il- <dig> stimulation of t-cells leads to an upregulation of nuclear factor of activated t cells   <cit> , a transcription factor regulating il- <dig> transcription  <cit>  resulting in il- <dig> expression, and thereby promotion of th <dig> polarized t cell differentiation  <cit> . second, il- <dig> upregulates the expression of silencer of cytokine signaling   <dig> in cd4+ cells which inhibits ifn-γ signaling and thus th <dig> differentiation  <cit> . the presence of il- <dig> may shift the th1/th <dig> balance towards th <dig>  <cit> .

cd <dig> ligation of dc is known to result in phosphorylation of map kinases like e.g. p <dig> and erk  <cit>  and the ratio between pp <dig> and perk is thought to play a crucial role in directing the cytokine secretion pattern of dc towards pro- or anti-inflammatory host responses  <cit> . cd <dig> ligation of mature dc resulted in phosphorylation of p <dig>  inhibition of pp <dig> using the inhibitor sb <dig> partially reduced of il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> but not il-12p <dig> levels. therefore, in mature dc pp <dig> might contribute to positive regulation of the p <dig> subunit of il-12p <dig>  <cit> . this is in line with others showing that pp <dig> is important for production of il-12p <dig>  <cit> . additionally, pp <dig> is known to increase the stability of il- <dig>  tnf-α and il- <dig> mrna  <cit>  which might result in increased secretion of these cytokines. furthermore, via the mitogen and stress activated protein kinase  1 pp <dig> is involved in nfκb activation  <cit> . in contrast, cd40l induced il-12p <dig> secretion from mature dc has been shown to be independent of p <dig> phosphorylation, but dependent on the nfκb inducing kinase   <cit> .

as we observed an only slight reduction of p <dig> phosphorylation in semimature dc we hypothesize that inhibition of p <dig> phosphorylation due to dc semimaturation is only one of many factors that may affect in interaction with others the cytokine secretion pattern of semimature dendritic cells in response to secondary cd <dig> stimulation and thus their reduced pro-inflammatory capability  <cit> . the slight differences in the map kinase phosphorylation pattern in response to cd <dig> ligation might be based on differences in cd <dig> expression of immature, semimature or mature dc. a strong cd <dig> signal is known to preferentially activate p <dig>  whereas weak cd <dig> signals are thought to favour erk phosphorylation  <cit> .

inhibition of perk during cd <dig> ligation turned out to have no significant effect of cytokine secretion in mature dc. in contrast, in semimature dc phosphorylation of erk was at least partially responsible for limiting il-12p <dig> expression. this is in line with others showing similar effects  <cit> . however, the western blot analysis did not reveal significant differences of perk levels in immature, semimature or mature dc. we speculate that in semimature dc the erk activation might probably control the il-12p <dig> production and therefore contribute to the limitation of the il- <dig> p <dig> production. we are aware that this is highly speculative and that further work has to elucidate the role of erk in dc semimaturation.

CONCLUSIONS
we hypothesize that the inability of cd <dig> ligation in overcoming dc semimaturation might contribute to the tolerogenic phenotype of semimature dc and at least partially account for maintenance of intestinal homeostasis.
