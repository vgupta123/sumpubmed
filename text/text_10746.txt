BACKGROUND
fish under intensive culture conditions are exposed to a variety of acute and chronic stressors, including elevated rearing densities, sub-optimal water quality including decreased dissolved oxygen  and high carbon dioxide , and thermal fluctuations  <cit> . during transportation and sorting, several factors may also lead to stress including handling and tank confinement  <cit> . osmoregulatory disturbance may be an outcome of stress, for which altered salinity is routinely used to mitigate negative effects, however high salinity such as in adaptation to seawater induces a stress response  <cit> . these and other stressors which are common to aquaculture production can induce physiological responses which may have adverse effects on traits important to producers and consumers, including those associated with growth, nutrition, reproduction, immune response, fillet quality, and environmental impacts  <cit> . understanding and monitoring the biological mechanisms underlying stress responses will facilitate alleviating their negative effects through selective breeding and changes in management practices, resulting in improved animal welfare and production efficiency.

studies which aim to characterize global gene expression in response to stress often use hybridization-based approaches  to identify differences between challenged and control fish  <cit> . hybridization techniques including those that employ microarrays can be high-throughput and are relatively inexpensive, however they present some limitations  <cit> . for instance: 1) the preparation of custom-made arrays requires previous knowledge of the target transcriptome expected to be represented in a sample; 2) hybridization data often present high background levels due to cross-hybridization; and 3) microarrays are not suitable for genes expressed at very low or very high levels because there is a limited range of detection due to background and saturation  <cit> . sequencing-based methodologies have also been used to characterize gene expression, full-length cdna and est  libraries have been sequenced using sanger technology, however, this method is low-throughput, expensive and usually not quantitative  <cit> . tag-based short sequence reads methodologies like sage  or mpss  are also high-throughput and quantitative, however the sequence reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to the reference genome; the transcriptome is still partially

analyzed; and it is usually not possible to distinguish different gene isoforms  <cit> . recently developed high-throughput sequencing technologies offer a new approach  for characterizing transcriptomes through high-throughput sequencing, mapping and quantification  <cit> . this approach is especially advantageous for non-model species, because it is not restricted by the unavailability of a genome reference sequence. additionally, rnaseq has very low background and sequences can be unambiguously mapped to reference sequences. the quantification is based on the number of sequences obtained, therefore it offers the detection of a higher expression range and it is possible to identify low or highly expressed genes. furthermore, this approach permits additional analysis such as the identification of putative single nucleotide polymorphisms , which can be identified in transcribed regions and have the potential to affect gene function  <cit> . rnaseq has previously been used for transcriptome characterization of non-model species, including butterfly  <cit> , silkworm  <cit> , garter snake  <cit> , coral  <cit> , pearl oyster  <cit>  and several fish species  <cit> , including rainbow trout  <cit> .

in the absence of a genome reference sequence for rainbow trout, we used roche  <dig> pyrosequencing technology to develop a reference transcriptome sequence to be used specifically in gene expression analyses associated with stress, including rnaseq based approaches. the library construction included a normalization process  <cit>  such that the reference transcriptome would constitute a qualitative resource attempting to represent the maximum number of unique transcripts from each of the tissues/treatment combinations as possible  <cit> . although the majority of stress gene expression research in rainbow trout has concentrated on evaluating the effect of only one stressor on one specific tissue  <cit> , our goal was to capture and characterize a collection of transcripts from multiple tissues from fish exposed to one of five stressors. as a result we aim to establish a comprehensive stress transcriptome resource that will facilitate understanding stress responses in this species. to this end we selected stressors that are among those commonly experienced by rainbow trout during aquaculture production and transport including high temperature, low temperature, low do/high co <dig>  seawater transfer, and handling/confinement.

previous studies have evaluated the combined effects of temperature and salinity on physiological condition of rainbow trout. niu et al.  <cit>  transferred juvenile rainbow trout from  <dig> °c to  <dig> °c, held them for two hours, and then transferred them to a 32‰ water at  <dig> °c to observe the effects osmotic stress during transfer from freshwater to saltwater. also, low temperature combined with sea water tolerance was analyzed by findstad et al  <cit>  who transferred fresh water acclimated rainbow trout to sea water at  <dig> and 8°c, and saunders et al  <cit>  who first acclimated the fish to salt water and placed them in floating cages until temperatures fell below 0°c. in this project we used similar parameters for high and low temperature and salinity treatments however we were conducted treatments independently. previous studies have suggested that oxygen concentrations above  <dig> mg/l are not limiting factors for growth  <cit>  and carbon dioxide in culture tanks should range between  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l  <cit>  therefore we combined effects of low do and high co <dig> by supplying fish with re-use water, a common practice in aquaculture production which uses water from rearing sites "upstream" to increase production capacity  <cit> . finally, fish were subjected to a handling and confinement stress routinely used for rainbow trout stress response research  <cit> .

we demonstrate that each stressor produced a physiological response by reporting changes in plasma variables indicative of various phases of a stress response  as well as changes in the expression of genes in gill tissue related to apoptosis  <cit>  and na/k transport. our reference transcriptome created by sequencing rna from multiple tissues of control and stressed fish is inclusive of transcripts expressed within the context of these unique physiological states and typical basal expression from control fish. we characterize the reference transcriptome by conducting an assembly of sequencing reads, assigning gene ontology annotation  <cit>  and identifying putative snps.

RESULTS
water quality parameters
water quality parameters including temperature, do, ph, co <dig>  and ammonia were measured at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours during the challenges and as summarized in additional file  <dig> . the desired parameters for each treatment were obtained within three hours of the beginning of the respective experiments. water ph values varied between  <dig>  and  <dig>  for both treatment and control conditions. concentrations of nitrogenous compounds levels were also within acceptable limits. in the "high temperature" treatment tanks, temperatures were elevated from  <dig> °c to an average of  <dig> °c within three hours  and remained elevated until the six hour  sampling period, at which temperatures averaged  <dig> °c. for the "low-temperature" treatment, water temperature was reduced to  <dig> °c within three hours , and was maintained at an average of  <dig> °c until time  <dig>  do levels are one of the most critical water quality parameters in trout culture and exposure to low levels of do  can result in mortality  <cit> . however, critical levels are directly correlated with other water quality parameters, like water temperature. do levels oscillated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg/l across the experimental tanks. although the average do concentration at sampling time  was lower in the re-use water treatment tanks than the control tank , it remained within acceptable limits for trout production. however, co <dig> levels were significantly higher  in treatment tanks compared to control . recommended upper limits for dissolved co <dig> range between  <dig> and  <dig> mg/l  <cit> .

physiological responses
we measured plasma cortisol as an indicator of primary response and glucose, lactate, chloride and lysozyme as indicators of secondary stress responses to detect if stress responses occurred and to characterize differences in responses that are unique to each stressor or shared among stressors. figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show the response of plasma glucose, lactate, chloride and cortisol concentrations in addition to lysozyme activity, respectively, compared across all treatments and controls. values from all control tanks were pooled and presented as a single mean, which was compared to the mean for each stress treatment. plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower than control in high temperature and re-use water treatments, and significantly higher than control in the low-temperature treatment. plasma lactate concentrations increased greater than 2-fold in high-temperature and saline treatments, and also increased after the handling treatment. in contrast, low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma lactate concentrations. high temperature and saline treatments increased, while low temperature and re-use water treatments decreased plasma chloride concentrations compared to control. lysozyme activity was slightly decreased in the re-use water treatment. finally, plasma cortisol concentrations increased dramatically, between 5- to 12-fold, compared to the controls, across all treatment groups. the magnitudes and directions of the differences of these parameters between treatments and the control groups reflect unique physiological response portfolios that result from each stressor, such that a sequencing a collection of transcripts isolated from tissues from stressed fish would serve as a qualitative representation of various physiological responses.

analysis of gene expression
stress and its resulting increase in cortisol levels have been reported to affect the onset of the apoptosis mechanism  <cit> . the expression of several apoptosis and stress-related candidate genes were analyzed in gill tissue using quantitative real-time pcr  to determine if changes in expression of relevant genes occurs during the stress response.

the caspases are proteolytic enzymes which are the core components of the intracellular apoptosis mechanism. caspases often function in cascades, where an upstream caspase is activated by its interaction with a caspase adaptor  <cit> . caspase  <dig>  is one of the upstream initiators known to trigger apoptosis, while caspase  <dig>  is activated downstream. figure 4a represents the differential expression  of casp <dig> and casp <dig> detected with qpcr. compared to control, the expression of casp <dig> was up-regulated in the high temperature treatment only. expression of casp <dig> increased in the handling, high-temperature, and salinity treatments.

qpcr results for tumor suppressor gene p <dig> , nuclear protein  <dig> , and heat shock protein  <dig> b  are reported in figure 4b. p <dig>  <cit>  has multiple functions, and can be induced by several stressors through different translation mechanisms; its major functions are to regulate apoptosis and growth arrest  <cit> . the expression of p <dig> was reduced in the reuse water and salinity treatments and increased in the high temperature treatment . nupr <dig> is also a multifunctional protein and similar to p <dig>  this protein can be induced by different stressors and takes part in apoptosis regulation  <cit> . momoda et al.  <cit>  studied gene expression in rainbow trout liver after handling stress, and documented an increased expression after  <dig> hours of stress and even higher after  <dig> h. however, in the current study, nupr <dig> expression was not significantly different from the control for any of the stress treatments. heat shock proteins  were initially identified as being induced after stressful thermal conditions; however, it is presently known that this group of proteins also responds to other environmental stressors  <cit> . expression of hsp70b was up-regulated in high temperature and salinity treatments, with a dramatic 600-fold increase in expression with the high-temperature stress.

to compensate for osmotic gain of fluid and diffusive loss of ions, freshwater teleosts developed an active ion transport mechanism. ions like na+, cl-, ca2+ are actively transported across the gill epithelium to maintain high levels of ions in the blood. euryhaline fishes that move from freshwater to salt water transform their gills from ion absorbing mechanisms to an ion-secreting epithelium, resulting in an increase of na+/k+-atpase  gene expression  <cit> . a previous study of nakatp expression in rainbow trout gill  <cit>  found that isoforms nakatpα1c and nakatpα <dig> did not respond to salinity exposure, while isoform nakatpα1a decreased expression within one day after being transferred to salt water and isoform nakatpα1b gradually increased its expression. in this study, expression of the nakatpα1a, nakatpα1b, and nakatpα1c isoforms were significantly reduced by high temperature treatment only. isoform nakatpα <dig> showed increased expression in fish exposed to the salinity treatment .

transcriptome sequencing and assembly
newbler and mira <dig> were used to assemble  <dig> , <dig> high quality reads generated by  <dig> pyrosequencing of the rainbow trout rna samples; this information is available through the short read archive in genbank as accession srx <dig>  detailed information on the assembly results is presented in table  <dig>  newbler aligned  <dig> , <dig> reads  including  <dig> , <dig> base pairs to contigs and  <dig>   reads were identified as singletons. the sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs with an average depth of  <dig> × coverage;  <dig>  of them were at least  <dig> base pairs long. the contigs were linked to form  <dig>  isotigs in  <dig>  isogroups. in addition,  <dig>  contigs were entered in the assembly results of isotigs. those contigs were larger than  <dig> base pairs and did not belong to any isotigs. thus, the total number of sequences assembled into isotigs was  <dig> . additionally,  <dig>  reads that presented a certain level of redundancy were considered singletons by newbler. those sequences were re-assembled using mira <dig>  consequently,  <dig>  more reads were assembled, resulting in  <dig>  mira <dig> contigs. this step improved the prediction of different gene variants. for example, there are two known variants of the apaf <dig> gene, and newbler assembly only predicted one of them, but mira <dig> identified the other variant. sequence and assembly information for contigs, isotigs, and isogroups are available at http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/docs.htm?docid= <dig> 

transcriptome characterization
for the newbler assembly, only isotigs that are longer than  <dig> bp were selected for annotation. to avoid redundancy, all isotigs with 90% or higher identities were grouped in one cluster and only a representative from each group was selected for annotation. this step reduced the number of sequences from newbler assembly from  <dig>  to  <dig> . moreover, the  <dig>  reads listed on mira <dig> results as debris , were masked with repeatmasker using the inra  rainbow trout repeat and cgrasp salmon masker databases, and  <dig>  masked sequences that have more than  <dig> base pairs of continuous non repetitive segments were also included in the annotation process. after adding the  <dig>  mira <dig> contigs;  <dig>  sequences were included used for annotations.

overall,  <dig>  sequences were detected as blastx hits. the top  <dig> distributions of blastx species are shown in figure  <dig>  in which zebrafish  is the most counted species, followed by atlantic salmon , pufferfish , and rainbow trout . in the mapping step, go annotation data for  <dig>  sequences were retrieved from the go database. default settings for blast2go annotation was used in the final annotation step and  <dig>  sequences were annotated, among them,  <dig>  are from newbler isotigs/contigs,  <dig>  are from mira <dig> contigs, and  <dig>  are from the masked reads.

the go term distribution  for the annotated sequences was distributed between level  <dig> and  <dig>  for the molecular function group , the distribution peaked at level  <dig>  the cellular component  and biological process  at level  <dig>  go annotation results of the sequences are presented in additional file  <dig> . in summary, of the  <dig>  sequences that were assigned go terms by b2g;  <dig>  are involved in biological processes,  <dig>  have molecular functions, and  <dig>  are cellular components. most of these sequences  are distributed among two or three general go term domains. in the biological process distribution, cellular process is the most abundant group , followed by metabolic process , and biological regulation . binding , catalytic activity , and molecular transducer activity  are the top three distributed molecular functions. for cellular component, cell  is the most found component, and other abundant cellular components are organelle , macromolecular complex , and membrane-enclosed lumen . these results are presented in additional file  <dig> figure s <dig>  to evaluate the representation of genes associated with stress response in the stress reference transcriptome, we searched the hit description and gene ontology term annotation in additional file  <dig>  for keywords associated with the treatments in our study. results in table  <dig> show that a significant number of sequences were identified from annotation associated with stress responses.

searching blastx hit descriptions and gene ontology terms associated with isotigs from the reference transcriptome reveals significant representation of transcripts expected to be involved in stress responses.

current rainbow trout transcriptome sequence datasets available in ncbi include  <dig>  est sequences in dbest and the 454-pyrosequencing data submitted to sra, which include  <dig> , <dig> sequences of a swanson double-haploid fish and  <dig> , <dig> other rainbow trout cdna sequences submitted by inra. in addition, there are  <dig>  sequence clusters generated from  <dig>  rainbow trout mrna and est sequences in ncbi unigene database and  <dig>  rainbow trout transcriptome reference sequences generated by salem et al.  <cit> . we compared our sequence reads with all of these datasets, and found that  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the reads can be mapped to the rainbow trout sequences in ncbi est, ncbi sra for double-haploid fish, and ncbi sra from inra, respectively. moreover, only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads can be aligned or partially aligned to the rainbow trout cluster sequences in ncbi unigene database, and the transcriptome reference sequences of salem et.al., respectively. these comparisons suggest that significant amounts of new data have been generated in our dataset.

snp discovery
four full sib families were used in this experiment, therefore assembly of the transcriptome data was expected to result in the identification of putative snps. a total of  <dig>  snps were identified from the newbler assembly which represents  <dig>  contigs assigned to  <dig>  isogroups. the average number of putative snps in a contig was  <dig>  and in an isogroup  <dig> . the maximum number of putative snps in a contig was  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs had only one putative snp. on average, one putative snp was found every  <dig> bp. the maximum number of putative snps in an isogroup was  <dig>  and  <dig>  isogroups had at least two snps. similarly, an additional  <dig> putative snps were identified from the mira <dig> assembly. overall, the putative snps would include  <dig>  transitions and  <dig>  transversions, similar to the 2: <dig> ratio observed in some but not all species  <cit> . to determine the potential for sequence variation to influence gene function we identified the location of putative snps in relation to gene sequences based on blastx alignments. overall,  <dig>  putative snps were determined to fall within exons,  <dig> of which were located in the first position of a codon and  <dig> the second, both sets expected to impact amino acid sequence and potentially gene function. we also predicted that  <dig>  putative snps are located in the third position, which as expected is much more than the first and second positions combined. an additional  <dig> snps were determined to be within exons however discrepancies of snp positions across multiple alignments resulted in uncertainty of codon position.

it is likely that some of the putative snps are actually paralogous sequence variants , and therefore are the result of gene duplication events and not sequence variation  <cit> . in salmonids we expect a high frequency of psvs due to an evolutionarily recent genome duplication event  <cit> . however, as all the sequences are transcribed differences may still be relevant to gene function as evolutionarily diverged paralogs sometimes have unique expression profiles  <cit> . these putative snps will be incorporated into a data set previously isolated from a genomic dna reduced representation library  <cit>  for genetic analyses in rainbow trout . although it would be interesting to evaluate these snps for allelic specific expression, our combining multiple tissues from multiple individuals for the creation of a normalized library for this experiment would not produce meaningful quantitative data. however, additional studies of these samples using rna-seq will permit such an analysis, yet we must first determine how to distinguish differential expression of allelic variants from that of closely related genes resulting from the genome duplication events.

CONCLUSIONS
we have generated and characterized a reference transcriptome for rainbow trout that represents multiple tissues responding to multiple stressors, and the unique expression portfolios for each. this resource complements existing public transcriptome data and will serve approaches aiming to evaluate gene expression associated with stress in this species.
