BACKGROUND
endophytes refer to microorganisms that asymptomatically colonise the internal tissues of plants for at least a part of their life cycle. each plant on earth, from the arctic tundra to the tropics, has been estimated to contain at least one endophyte  <cit> . fungi and bacteria are the most common microbes existing as endophytes and presumed to have originated from the external environment, although some endophytes are vertically transmitted to succeeding plant generations via seeds  <cit> . a number of these microorganisms have intimate interactions with their host plants and can promote plant growth as well as enhance host adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress factors  <cit> . in some cases, the beneficial effects of endophytes are exhibited through production of bioactive secondary metabolites, such as plant hormones , adenine ribosides and defence-related compounds .

although endophytes were discovered as early as  <dig>  they did not receive significant attention until the isolation of taxol from an endophytic fungus taxomyces andreanae in  <dig>  <cit> . endophytes have since then been shown to produce several other well-known and important plant-derived compounds, such as camptothecin  <cit> , isocoumarin  <cit>  and podophyllotoxin  <cit> , amongst others . although heinig et al.  <cit>  re-examined and found no evidence of independent taxane biosynthesis in any of the endophytes associated with taxus species in  <dig>  it is believed that endophytes will become alternative sources for pharmacologically important natural products from plants  <cit> . in addition, endophytes can also produce a wide range of novel natural compounds with various biological activities . as a significantly untapped reservoir of functional metabolites, endophytes are fairly under-utilised  <cit> . as such, additional investigations are necessary to discover new endophytes with potential applications  <cit> .

mistletoe viscum coloratum, a semi-parasitic evergreen dioecious shrub, is an important medicinal herb used in traditional chinese medicine mainly for treating rheumatic arthralgia and foetal upset  <cit> . although mistletoe and its active secondary metabolites have been widely studied , research on endophytes from this herb is virtually unavailable. endophytic fungal communities in the semi-parasitic epiphyte v. album and its phorophyte pinus sylvestris were recently compared and studied  <cit> ; however, no viscum endophyte was isolated and screened for active compounds. during a screening program for endophytic microbes hosted by v. coloratum, an endophytic fungus, me4- <dig>  was isolated from the floral parts of the plant. the aim of the present study is to characterise the floral endophyte together with its active compounds. the major metabolites produced by the strain are aromatic compounds, including cyclo- , indole-3-carboxylic acid  , indole-3-carbaldehyde , mellein  and 2-phenylethanol  , all of which are valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and food industries, as well as host close related metabolites.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
identification of endophytic fungus me4-2
six segments of each floral sample were placed on potato dextrose agar  and screened for the presence of endophytic fungi. me4- <dig> was consistently isolated from all samples and selected for further studies. me4- <dig> grew well on pda and czapek’s media. cultures were initially white with moderately dense aerial mycelium and then turned grey after  <dig> d with thick aerial mycelium. the mycelium consisted of smooth, branched, septate and subhyaline hyphae. no conidium was observed under the test conditions employed, including cultivation on water agar  with pine needles or mistletoe twigs for  <dig> d or at room temperature with diffused daylight. the optimum temperature for strain growth was 30°c, and the strain reached 90 mm in diameter on pda and synthetic low nutrient agar  after  <dig> and 96 h, respectively.

to acquire phylogenetic information on the fungus, the dna sequence of the internal transcribed spacer  regions of me4- <dig> was amplified and sequenced. the pcr products included approximately  <dig> base pairs. unreliable sequence data from the ends of the sequences were excluded and  <dig> characters  were used during analysis. a phylogenetic tree was constructed  based on the its sequences of me4- <dig> and closely related strains. me4- <dig> formed a distinct branch within the genus lasiodiplodia and was closely related to l. pseudotheobromae. molecular analysis indicated that me4- <dig> is a new member of the genus lasiodiplodia. previous research  <cit>  showed that lasiodiplodia sp. is one of the more common endophytes found in marketed flowers, consistent with our findings. we note, however, that the use of a single its sequence is insufficient to achieve complete analysis. to establish the taxonomic status of the strain with high precision, three or more genes are necessary to construct phylogenetic trees.figure  <dig>

secondary metabolites produced by strain me4- <dig> in broth culture
to characterise lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig> further, secondary metabolites produced by the strain cultured in czapek’s broth for  <dig> d were isolated and identified. four aromatic compounds with relatively high concentrations were obtained and identified as cyclo- , ica , indole-3-carbaldehyde  and mellein . an additional trace but detectable compound, namely, 2-phenylethanol , was also found using gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry .

compound  <dig> was determined as cyclo-  by nuclear magnetic resonance  analysis and comparison of its date with those reported in the literature  <cit> . the compound is known to be isolated from many microorganisms and shows weak antioxidant activity  <cit> .

compounds  <dig> and  <dig> were identified as ica and indole-3-carbaldehyde, respectively, through comparison with authentic samples . the molecular structures of the compounds were further confirmed through their nmr spectra. both compounds are commonly present in microorganisms and plants and present antimicrobial and antitumor activities  <cit> . the biological role of ica, which is regarded as an inactive auxin  analogue, in plants has long been neglected. recent studies indicate that ica may perform important functions in plant basal defence against biotic stress, and has been identified as a mediator of induced resistance in arabidopsis against plant pathogens  <cit> . endophytes are known to produce bioactive compounds that protect their plant hosts from various pathogens. however, whether or not ica is actually produced in the plant and whether or not the compound produced by me4- <dig> is beneficial to its host have yet to be determined.table  <dig>

compound  <dig> was identified as mellein based on gc-ms and nmr data. the gc-ms spectrum of  <dig> showed a molecular ion peak at m/z  <dig>  which is identical to that of mellein. the uv, 1h nmr and 13c nmr data of  <dig> were also consistent with those reported for the known compound  <cit> . whilst mellein has been previously isolated from various fungi, including plant pathogens and endophytes, the present study is the first to report mellein isolation from a floral endophytic fungus. mellein, originally identified as a phytotoxic compound, is a versatile compound with various biological activities, such as antibacterial, fungicidal, anti-worm and hcv protease-inhibitory  <cit> . interestingly, the compound has been also isolated from various insect secretions as a trail or alarm pheromone  <cit> .

compound  <dig> was determined to be 2-phenylethanol through comparison with a commercially available standard . the fragmentation pattern of the compound in its gc-ms spectrum as well as its behaviour during high-pressure liquid chromatography  were identical to those of synthetic 2-phenylethanol. compound  <dig> was a minor secondary metabolite produced by lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig> cultured in pda and czapek’s broth. supplementing the basic growth medium with precursors can improve the yields of the microbial products  <cit> . to increase 2-phenylethanol production, me4- <dig> was cultured in czapek’s broth supplemented with 6 g/l l-phenylalanine, a well-known precursor of 2-phenylethanol. addition of l-phenylalanine to czapek’s medium significantly increased 2-phenylethanol contents , which reached 226 mg/l. by contrast, a low 2-phenylethanol content of around 7–35 mg/l was obtained when the medium contained yeast extracts, peptone, tryptophan or 2so <dig> as an additional nitrogen source.figure  <dig>

2-phenylethanol, a well-known flavour and fragrance substance with a rose-like odour, naturally occurs in the essential oils of certain flowers, such as rose, narcissi, lilies and jasmine  <cit> . natural 2-phenylethanol has also been isolated from several types of fungi, including yeasts, mushrooms and filamentous fungi  <cit> . it is now generally accepted that some endophytes can produce similar chemical compounds to those produced by their hosts  <cit> . however, few floral endophytes have been screened for essential oil components, such as 2-phenylethanol. consumer preference for natural compounds has recently stimulated the search for microorganisms that can produce 2-phenylethanol. isolation of lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig>  a potential phenylethanol producer, indicates that flower endophytes may be important resources of natural flavours.

ica biosynthetic pathway in lasiodiplodia sp. me4-2
ica is an important intermediate product for pharmaceutical and agricultural industries with an aromatic indole ring  <cit> . interestingly, me4- <dig> can synthesise ica without tryptophan, which is believed to be a precursor of ica. it has been suggested that tryptophan was converted to ica via iaa in microorganisms  <cit> . several holoparasitic dicotyledonous plants, however, can directly metabolise l-tryptophan to indole-3-carboxaldehyde, which is further converted to ica  <cit> . the ica biosynthetic pathway in me4- <dig> was examined by analysing metabolic intermediates. the gc-ms spectrum of the fungal culture extract showed  the presence of a peak at a retention time of  <dig>  min, which corresponds well with standard ica. peaks with retention times of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  min corresponded to the retention times of authentic indole, indole-3-carbaldehyde and tryptophan, respectively. no iaa was detected in the culture medium. whilst these results suggest that de novo ica biosynthesis in me4- <dig> may occur via an iaa-independent route, more studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a fungal endophyte lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig> from mistletoe flowers was isolated and identified using molecular characterisation results. lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig> is a newly isolated endophyte that can produce several interesting aromatic compounds, including cyclo-, ica, indole-3-carbaldehyde, mellein and 2-phenylethanol, which are valuable compounds for the pharmaceutical and food industries. a pooled analysis of published literature together with our results suggests a close relationship between the strain and its floral host. ica, a plant cell wall-bound metabolite that could mediate accelerated callose accumulation in response to pathogens, may enhance the host adaptation to various biotic stress factors. mellein, whether as a phytotoxic compound or an alarm pheromone, may also affect the growth of its host plant. 2-phenylethanol is a common component of flower essential oils. although only small amounts of 2-phenylethanol are produced by me4- <dig> cultured in synthetic media, production of this compound can be significantly increased by addition of l-phenylalanine to the culture broth. interestingly, the major route of ica biosynthesis in lasiodiplodia sp. me4- <dig> does not occur through iaa, which has been considered a precursor of ica except in several rare cases. the present study introduces a fungal producer of several important aromatic compounds and enriches our knowledge of endophytes.
