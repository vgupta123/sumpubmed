BACKGROUND
during pleistocene glaciations, northwest europe, siberia and the northern most regions in north america were covered with ice sheets  <cit> . pleistocene glaciations had extensive impact on phylogeographic patterns within and among closely related species of many vertebrates  <cit> . in europe and north america, various species have been studied to determine the climatic and geological effects on phylogeographic patterns and population structures. in europe and america, species dispersed to southern locations to survive in refugia and then expanded northward again during interglacial periods when climate recovered to or exceeded current mean global temperatures. although there are discussion and debates regarding the degree of pleistocene effects on speciation in north american birds  <cit> , pleistocene conditions appear to have played an active role both in initiating intraspecific and species-level divergences of the most closely related north american taxa  <cit> . however, climate recovery in east asia during interglacial periods did not seem to resemble that of europe or north america primarily due to the continuing uplift of the tibet plateau during late tertiary. in china, the glacial advance was not as extensive as in europe and north america because of the monsoons in east asia. biotic zones of asia were also located at higher northern latitude than on other continents  <cit> . despite the relatively mild climate, species' distribution were affected by climatic fluctuations during pleistocene. however, research on the phylogeography of vertebrates in east asia, especially in china, remains limited both in terms of the number of model species and geological timescales.

the black-spotted frog  is a widespread species found in east asia covering both palaearctic and oriental realms. the wide distribution of this species in northeast, north, east, central and southwest china renders it an ideal model for investigating the palaeoclimatic effects on vertebrates in east asia. p. nigromaculata is variable in size and color pattern over its wide geographic range; but shows no distinct morphological differentiation among populations and no subspecies have been designated. traditionally, the black-spotted frog was treated as a member of genus rana, but was recently placed into pelophylax, a genus reintroduced by fei et al.  <cit> . recent studies on the phylogeny of ranid frogs based on mitochondrial and nuclear dna sequences consistently supported pelophylax as a well resolved monophyletic unit  <cit> .

studies of molecular phylogeography of p. nigromaculata have been independently reported by two groups. yang et al. proposed that during the last interglacial period, p. nigromaculata experienced a rapid population expansion and that its distribution range fluctuated latitudinally in response to climatic oscillations  <cit> . but details of the evolutionary history and population structure were not inferred because of the small number of sampling localities  and the relatively few cyt b sequence data . in a previous study, we examined the genetic structure of this frog in mainland china using 5'control region sequences and detected significant subdivision between jilin-liaoning  populations and other mainland populations  <cit> .

in this report, we tested the hypothesis that the quaternary glaciations were the causes of this significant genetic structure. we analyzed the complete mitochondrial cyt b sequences and generated issr fingerprint data in order to reconstruct the phylogeographic patterns in black-spotted frog populations sampled from  <dig> localities across the chinese range . these data allowed us to assess the evolutionary history  of various chinese populations and to address the hypothesis that the observed phylogeographic divisions are consistent with past range fragmentation by pleistocene glaciations.

for each population sampled , we list collection localities , sample sizes , the unique mtdna haplotype numbers present, genbank accession numbers, and the clade  represented.

RESULTS
cytochrome b variation
of the entire  <dig> bp of cyt b sequences,  <dig> nucleotides are variable and  <dig> are parsimony-informative. nine,  <dig>  and  <dig> variable sites are in the first, second, and third codon positions, respectively. no indels or premature stop codons were observed. this result, together with a strong bias against guanine , implies that the target fragment is mitochondrial cyt b rather than its nuclear homologue. we identified  <dig> haplotypes among the  <dig> p. nigromaculata complete cyt b sequences . eighty-seven of these were unique haplotypes,  <dig> were shared within local populations and  <dig> were shared among local populations . the sequence distances  vary from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  among ingroup taxa, distances among different haplotype clades vary from  <dig> % to  <dig> % . the overall haplotype diversity  and nucleotide diversity  were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

rows: haplotypes and the lineages they belong to; columns: populations. the integers correspond to the number of individuals found with each haplotype.

cyt b phylogenetics
maximum parsimony  analysis from  <dig> ingroup haplotypes resulted in  <dig> most parsimonious trees, each  <dig> steps in length . two major monophyletic haplotype groups were revealed in the chinese population of p. nigromaculata: designated here as clade a and clade b . clade a included all haplotypes present in most sampling regions of this frog species: from northeast china  to southwest china ; clade b was found limited to eastern part of northeast china . clade a was further subdivided into two sub-clades: a <dig>  with a broad geographical distribution and weak phylogenetic structure; a <dig>  with higher bootstrap support of 85% and distributed to mountainous regions of southwest china . when included the korean and japanese haplotypes, this phylogenetic topology showed that the single korean haplotype and clade b clustered with 100% bootstrap support, and that the three japanese haplotypes formed a sister relationship with clade a and showed 100% bootstrap value .

maximum parsimony , maximum likelihood  and neighbor-joining  analysis of our reduced dataset resulted in concordant topologies . ml analysis resulted in a tree with a likelihood score of -ln l =  <dig> ; mp analysis resulted in  <dig> most parsimonious trees, each  <dig> steps in length . the most obvious feature of the three topologies was consistent with those revealed by mp tree based on  <dig> haplotypes . the sequence distances among these haplotype clades also yielded obvious insight of such phylogenetic relationships . the division pattern of haplotypes into several clades  was concordant in three analyses, but support for sub-clade a <dig> was lower in ml  than in mp  and nj  analyses. lower support in ml compared to the mp and nj analyses was likely the result of a more complex model of sequence evolution used for ml reconstruction.

bold values along the diagonal are average distance within lineage.

for all the sequence data, fu and li's d* and f* were negative and not significant, and tajima's d = - <dig> , which was not significantly different from  <dig> . patterns of variation within our mitochondrial data are thus consistent with the neutrality hypothesis.

pcr-rflp analysis
most haplotypes are unique to local populations. haplotypes shared across local populations  occur entirely in geographically adjacent areas except for one case , which is shared between southwest china  and central china . to our surprise, locality  <dig>  is composed of haplotypes grouping of the two highly divergent lineages . this observation suggests that the dongliao area  may represent a secondary contact zone of the two deeply split lineages. accordingly, we widened our sampling scales in this region and collected samples from four contiguous sites of 25-a, 25-b, 25-c, and 25-d with the maximum pairwise distances about  <dig> km . we used  <dig> individuals in the pcr-rflp analysis on cyt b. when the pcr products digested with taq i and xba i, the expected fragment sizes were  <dig> and  <dig> bp for haplotype a, and were  <dig> and  <dig> bp for haplotype b. the pcr product-digestion patterns allow us to readily distinguish which haplotype group each product  belongs to. all  <dig> samples from site 25-a are identified as haplotype a, while  <dig> and  <dig> in 25-b are respectively a and b. in 25-c,  <dig> and  <dig> belongs to a and b respectively and total  <dig> samples from 25-d are all b haplotype. such a distribution pattern strongly supports that secondary contact and introgression between lineages a and b had occurred in this region.

nested-clade phylogeographic analysis
haplotypes separated by up to eight mutational steps were connected following the hierarchical nesting procedure. the two haplotype clades were grouped into two independent networks . one hundred and six haplotypes and  <dig> nesting levels were included in cladogram a ,  <dig> haplotypes and  <dig> nesting levels in cladogram b . for both cladograms, fifteen nested groups showed significant geographical associations in nested contingency test . further, the nested distance analysis showed that  <dig> nested groups in both haplotype cladograms have geographic distributions that differ significantly from random expectations . contiguous range expansion, isolation by distance, long-distance colonization and past fragmentation were inferred at different levels , which facilitated the identification of additional sampling areas.

for both cladograms, range expansion was inferred at higher levels . tip  clades are more widespread geographically than interior  haplotypes, which is characteristic of range expansion  <cit> . for total cladogram a, there was no conclusive inference due to the lack of tip-interior differentiation. restricted gene flow with isolation by distance is a repeated pattern inferred in clade-groups 2- <dig>  3- <dig>  4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  these four groups correspond to lineage a <dig> and distribute most sampling localities. for group 3- <dig> and 3- <dig> which include haplotypes from coastal population , south-western population , and most central or eastern populations, we do not have sufficient evidence to discriminate between long-distance movement and the combined effects of gradual movement during a past range expansion and fragmentation. long-distance colonization  is interpreted for group 3- <dig>  which is located in the south-western plateau and corresponds to lineage a <dig>  inadequate geographical sampling is identified within group 3- <dig> which corresponds to the regions between northeast and north china . allopatric fragmentation is predicted within group 4- <dig> and 4- <dig>  the former group is located across southwest china and eastern most regions, while the latter is composed of haplotypes from north-eastern populations and the east china populations.

numbers in parenthesis are amount of sub-level clades within each group.

historical demography
mismatch distributions for the entire group exhibited two distinct modes . we assume that the left peak represents a stationary expansion corresponding to lineage a, but the "older" peak on the right is unlikely due to demographic expansion. rather, may result from the deep split between the lineages, perhaps caused by bottlenecking and lineage sorting in allopatry . for the three independent lineages, the pairwise differences all show unimodal patterns, which suggests that demographic expansions occurred within each. mismatch distributions for lineage b and sub-lineage a <dig> did not differ significantly  from expectations under the sudden-expansion model  <cit> . whereas, sub-lineage a <dig> was weakly significant , but tajima's d and fu's fs are both negative . our estimated time since expansion for lineage a <dig>  a <dig> and b were different. expansions of sub-lineage a <dig> took place contemporarily about  <dig>  mya, whereas expansion was about  <dig>  mya for sub-lineage a <dig> and  <dig>  mya for lineage b. the sequence variation  of each lineage differs in our estimated h and π. the presence of high h and high π  in the total populations seems to reflect the fact that different mtdna lineages were analyzed together. similarly, the same genetic diversity pattern was observed for sub-lineage a <dig> , which means this lineage is a large population with admixed local populations. relatively low h and extremely low π  were found in sub-lineage a <dig>  suggesting that a prolonged bottleneck was present in this population. in lineage b, π is low  but h is otherwise , which can be explained by rapid population growth from ancestral populations  <cit> .

npop: number of populations; nind: number of individuals; nhap number of haplotypes; h: haplotype diversity; π: nucleotide diversity.

based on the results from the mdiv analysis, the posterior distribution for t revealed a sharp peak at  <dig> . with substitution rate of  <dig> % per myr  <cit> , our estimate of the timing of lineage divergence,  <dig>  mya , supports a pleistocene split. further within the lineage a, divergence time between the two sub-lineages was estimated to be  <dig>  mya , roughly corresponding to the riss glaciation   <cit> .

issr polymorphism and population structure
the  <dig> issr primers generated a total of  <dig> bands, of which  <dig> were polymorphic thus showing  <dig> % polymorphism and an average genetic diversity of  <dig> . the number of bands generated by individual primers varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the average being  <dig> . the genetic variation indices at the species level were ppb =  <dig> , ao =  <dig> , ae =  <dig> , he =  <dig> , and i =  <dig> , much higher than the mean values of all populations, especially the ppb .

the upgma  dendrogram showed similar topology to that of the mitochondrial phylogeny, showing divergence between the mitochondrial clade a and clade b, and also between sub-clade a <dig> and sub-clade a <dig> . as expected, we detected potential gene flow between lineage a and lineage b in dl area. fig.  <dig> was the pcr banding pattern with primer ubc <dig>  as shown , band l. a can be readily recognized as a lineage a-special band, while band l. b was unique in lineage b. in the  <dig> individuals  of the mitochondrial linage b, l. b was detected, while in  <dig> individuals  of lineage a, both bands  were amplified . interestingly, in individual dl <dig> which belongs to mitochondrial lineage a , only band l. b. was detected. this phenomenon was not found in all other local populations, and provided nuclear evidence to support the secondary contact and introgression between lineage a and b at dongliao area.

discussion
evolutionary history and independent refugia
amphibians are known to exhibit a higher degree of population subdivision than any other major animal taxon  <cit> . our analyses revealed that there are two reciprocally monophyletic lineages within chinese range of p. nigromaculata: the mainland lineage  and the northeast lineage . the deep intraspecific split  in cyt b is not of the same magnitude as to some anuran amphibians  and other vertebrate groups . zhang et al. had also detected a deep haplotype split within p. nigromaculata on mitochondrial 5' control region  <cit> . the interpretation was that the relatively long-term hibernation of the north-eastern population limited its ability of gene flow with other mainland populations. in other words, genetic drift under natural selection in northeast china resulted in a deep divergence of this frog species. in such a case, selective sweeps would be expected to affect the evolutionary pattern of cyt b, but this conjecture was not supported by the neutral tests of our dataset which indicated that its patterns of variation were consistent with the hypothesis of neutrality. according to the estimated divergence time of cyt b haplotypes, the two lineages of p. nigromaculata diverged approximately  <dig>  mya , similar to that of other anurans isolation events  <cit> . this divergence time was roughly congruent with the gunz glaciation , which may be the cause of allopatric isolation and the lineage split.

geographically, lineage a  covers almost the entire sampling region of this study. lineage b is restricted to the eastern part of northeast china . the patterns of diversification suggest complex histories involving both allopatric isolation among refugial areas and prominent patterns of dispersal. we proposed that there were two independent refugia during pleistocene glaciations. one refugium was the eastern monsoon region and the lower elevations of the south-western plateau. unlike europe and north america, china was not covered by continental ice sheets during the quaternary  <cit> , even though the climate was cold and dry. the permafrost had expanded southward by about  <dig> degrees latitude to the present day great wall line and the ice-age "mammoth fauna" had roamed in north china and had even reached the yangtze river estuary  <cit> . conversely, the climate in eastern china was relatively moist and warm; therefore, eastern china was likely an alternative for this water-dependent frog to live through the cold periods. zhang also suggested that eastern china was a refugium for temperate and tropical-subtropical faunas during cold stages of the quaternary  <cit> . the fact that most haplotypes from eastern local populations are present in interior clades of the parsimony network a again substantiates our east china refugium contention. although the south-western plateau had been identified with 3– <dig> glaciations that are dated to late and middle pleistocene  <cit> , environmental diversity of tropics and subtropics in lower elevations are still maintained  <cit> . this region has retained many relic floras of tertiary and was also a refugium for temperate and subtropical floras in cold periods of quaternary  <cit> . it is possible for p. nigromaculata to have survived the lower elevations in cold periods and expand afterwards.

we suggest that the other refugium was situated in the present day korean peninsula. this peninsula is situated between 33°–43° n and 124°–132° e, and is adjacent to northeast china. recent studies on the quaternary indicated that there were mountain glaciations developed in the changbai cordillera  <cit> , which lies between china and north korea. but the korean peninsula, characterized by subtropical mountain climate  <cit> , was not deeply affected by the global climate changes starting in the pleistocene. the sustained stable environment was presumably favorable to p. nigromaculata. the korean haplotype clustered with clade b and differed by only  <dig>  on cyt b sequence from b further strengthens the notion of a korean refugium.

expansion of lineage a
using nca on the cyt b data, we obtained further insights into the phylogeographic pattern in lineage a of p. nigromaculata. first, contiguous range expansion was predicted for cladogram a in the highest nesting level , which represents an older event in the evolutionary history of p. nigromaculata. this conclusion helps explain the species' current distribution in the north-eastern areas and in the high elevations of south-western plateau where former glaciations occurred. the tip haplotypes are interpreted as being younger than the interior ones  <cit> . we found that the majority of younger haplotypes distributed in the most peripheral populations of the species' range . this pattern, together with the unimodal mismatch distributions, supports the range expansion inference of lineage a. most ancient haplotypes distributed in eastern china also suggest that this area was the origin of the last interglacial range expansion. from the high genetic variation of this lineage and the fact that most common haplotypes are shared among eastern and south-western populations, we can conclude that the eastern and south-western regions were the ice-age refugium for lineage a. from this refugium, p. nigromaculata expanded in all directions to form the current distribution pattern . following range expansion, restricted gene flow isolation by distance  at lower nesting levels  took place repeatedly, which seems to represent more recent dynamics of this species. these results likely indicate that gene flow decreased with geographic distance, despite the fact that there were rivers distributed across the frogs' range. it also reflects the reduced vagility of amphibian species. the close relationship between japanese and clade a haplotypes might be an indication of its origin. throughout the quaternary, sea level has risen and fallen as continental ice sheets have waned and waxed  <cit> , and it was about 70– <dig> m lower than present during the last glacial period when the eurasia continent was in connection with japanese archipelago by a land bridge  <cit> . additionally, the deepest korean strait makes it controversial of whether a land-bridge connection existed in that place during late quaternary  <cit> . via the land bridge, we suggest, p. nigromaculata colonized japan from chinese eastern coast . however, further samples from the japanese population are required in future studies.

for group 2- <dig>  in lineage a <dig>  we could not distinguish past fragmentation\long-distance colonization from contiguous range expansion due to the inadequate sampling design. again, in group 3- <dig>  the two north-eastern populations and two populations near the shandong peninsula  were included, for which the patterns of fragmentation and isolation by distance were not identified due to sampling gaps. nonetheless, it may imply that, when recolonizing northeast china during the last interglacial period, these peninsula-adjacent populations were founders. the recolonizing route might have been via the shandong region to northeast china . this is also consistent with the topology of mp tree , in which the north-eastern haplotypes are clustered with the peninsula-adjacent haplotypes. the route through which lineage a <dig> recolonized baoshan  is somewhat puzzlings. the baoshan population is an isolated population hundreds of kilometres apart from the nearest p. nigromaculata population in sichuan. it is recognized not only by the specimens we obtained in  <dig>  but also by  <dig> specimens collected in  <dig> by the researchers from chengdu institute of biology, chinese academy of sciences . however, due to the relatively high diversity level , and the relatively few individuals studied, we were unable to unequivocally identify the origin of the baoshan population.

group 3- <dig>  corresponding to lineage a <dig> is composed of all south-western plateau populations characterized by long-distance colonization, and possibly couple with subsequent fragmentation. the unimodal mismatch distribution in this lineage suggests recent rapid colonization. the estimated time since expansion was about  <dig>  mya, after the last glacial maximum . according to the palaeoclimatic records of this region  <cit> , ice sheet on the mountain had shifted vertically in response to the oscillations of ice ages, natural zones have also moved vertically since the pleistocene, but retained environmental diversity of tropics and subtropics in lower elevations. p. nigromaculata likely survived in these areas in ice-ages and rapidly expanded subsequently. based on the dispersal theory of hewitt  <cit> , once a place is occupied by a leading edge expansion population through dispersal, it will be much more difficult for those behind them to follow. the imprint of this is reduced genomic variability. the strikingly low levels of genetic variation, especially the observation that multiple individuals from distant geographic regions share one single haplotype  strongly supports rapid expansion.

recolonization to northeast china of lineage b
contiguous range expansion is also inferred for total cladogram b, which restricted to northeast china. mismatch distribution also lend strong support to the conclusion of population expansion of this lineage. the last global glaciation corresponds respectively to the würm, wisconsin and weichsel glaciation in alps, north america and western europe  <cit> . in china the same period is called dali glaciation, which began at about  <dig>  mya. in europe and north america, the most extensive glacial period was during the last glacial maximum  beginning  <dig>  ~  <dig>  mya, whereas in china the most extensive glacial period was not lgm, but the early stage  of the dali glaciation  <cit>  when northeastern china was cold and the changbai cordillera was covered with ice caps  <cit> . the korean peninsula was assumed to be a refugium not only because the relatively mild climate of the peninsula, but also because of the phylogenetic basal position of the korean haplotype. our estimated time of expansion was about  <dig>  mya for the p. nigromaculata lineage b and it was likely after the early extensive glacial period in dali glaciation, that this lineage colonized northeast china via the changbai cordillera, but not after the last glacial maximum when many lineages in europe and north america underwent expansions. the current distribution of lineage b suggests that after recolonizing northeast china, this lineage remained in situ rather than expanding southward, at least in the present interglacial period.

secondary contact and introgressive gene flow
secondary contact of previously isolated populations after the last glacial maximum in europe and north-america are well established  <cit> . in the present study, we uncovered a population where haplotype lineage a and b of p. nigromaculata coexisted in dongliao area . the dl population, located in northeast china, is the only one composed of both lineages, a conclusion confirmed by nucleotide sequences, pcr-rflp, and issr patterns. hence, the dl region  was likely a rather narrow secondary contact zone during the current interglacial period. the full range of the secondary contact zone remains to be defined.

in general, hybrid or contact zones between populations or species of varying degrees of differentiation provide a potentially important source of information about how taxa diverge and populations interact. we could not conclude that in the area of sympatry, genetic isolation exists between the two lineages based solely on high mtdna sequence divergence of  <dig> %. indeed our nuclear issr data suggest some inter-lineage gene flow in the dl population. two lines of evidence support this contention. first, in  <dig> individuals of mitochondrial lineage a, both bands of l. a. and l. b. were amplified. second, one lineage a individual only possessed l. b band. the former may arise from the hybridization between males of lineage b and females of lineage a, and the later might be caused by backcross of female hybrids of the former with males of lineage b. in other words, these two divergent lineages may have experienced a recent hybridization resulting in introgressive gene flow.

CONCLUSIONS
our phylogeographic study suggests that, two mitochondrial lineages diverged about  <dig>  mya beginning in independent refugia during the pleistocene glaciation. two main clades, a and b, differing by c.  <dig> % sequence divergence were detected. the a clade is further subdivided into two sub-clade, a <dig> and a <dig> differing by  <dig> %. the two refugia seemed to be located in east china and the lower elevations of south-western plateau, and in korean peninsula, respectively. contiguous range expansion from the two refugia during last interglacial period resulted in the current distribution pattern of this frog species. lineage a covers almost the entire sampling region of this study. lineage b is restricted to the eastern part of northeast china. secondary contact was detected in dl area where both lineages coexisted, as confirmed by nucleotide sequences, pcr-rflp and issr analyses. issr results provided further evidence for introgressive gene flow between the two lineages in this area. although climate events of the pleistocene in east asia did not seem to resemble that of europe or north america, they do have had marked effect on the historical distribution and intraspecific divergence of amphibians as in europe and north america.
