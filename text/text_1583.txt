BACKGROUND
iron is a critical element required for normal homeostasis. this fact is best exemplified by the role of iron in diverse physiological processes such as dna synthesis, respiration and oxygen transport. body iron levels must be precisely maintained within certain limits as iron-deficiency and iron-overload result in perturbations of normal metabolism. to achieve appropriate levels of cellular iron and to avoid iron-loading, several mechanisms have evolved; these include the control of iron transport, storage and recycling by regulatory proteins. a key step in controlling overall body iron levels is absorption of dietary iron in the duodenum. iron absorption is a highly regulated process, as mammals have no controlled means to excrete excess iron. recently, several key proteins involved in intestinal iron transport have been identified. these include the brush-border membrane associated proteins duodenal cytochrome b , and divalent metal transporter  <dig> , which together allow dietary iron to be reduced and transported into enterocytes. the combined activity of hephaestin  and ferroportin  subsequently allows oxidized iron to exit the cell and bind to transferrin for distribution throughout the body. intestinal iron transport is in part regulated by the liver-derived, antimicrobial peptide, hepcidin. under conditions of iron excess, elevated hepcidin acts to remove fpn from the basolateral surface of enterocytes effectively creating a mucosal block to iron  <cit> .

iron-deprivation increases expression of genes involved in intestinal iron-transport in laboratory rodents  <cit>  and in humans  <cit> . some of these induced genes are regulated post-transcriptionally via the iron regulatory protein /iron-response element  system. these genes include ferritin, transferrin receptor  and possibly dmt <dig>  <cit>  and fpn  <cit> . despite the large body of work describing these regulatory events, many transcripts encoding proteins involved in iron homeostasis do not have ires and it is thus very likely that transcriptional regulation may also be important  <cit> . despite the wealth of knowledge regarding transcriptional regulation of gene expression in response to iron-deprivation in lower species such as yeast  <cit> , no such regulatory networks have been identified to date in mammals.

our previous studies were the first that utilized a genome wide approach to identify genes regulated during iron-deficiency in the mammalian duodenum  <cit> . we identified a large number of differentially expressed genes , many of which had never been described to be regulated by iron or body iron status. in the current manuscript, we utilized computational and bioinformatics approaches to identify regulatory mechanisms that may mediate the genetic response to iron deprivation. we thus first used clustering algorithms to group genes from our previous genechip® studies to identify groups of co-regulated genes. of particular interest was a group of  <dig> probe sets  that were up-regulated across several different stages of postnatal development. interestingly, of these genes, only the dmt <dig> and tfr genes contained 3' ires, suggesting that analysis of transcriptional regulatory regions could be a fruitful approach to identify common regulatory mechanisms. our subsequent analyses found that sp1-like binding sites were statistically enriched in promoters from these genes in rat and were conserved across  <dig> mammalian species. additional studies suggested that sp and fox transcription factors may work synergistically to regulate some genes during iron-deprivation; in fact, we found conserved fox binding sites in many genes with conserved sp <dig> binding sites. we thus hypothesize that sp and fox family transcription factors are involved in regulating expression of a subset of intestinal genes induced during iron-deficiency. we also found strong induction  of specificity factor  <dig>  by qrt-pcr, suggesting that it may be the sp family member that mediates the genetic response to iron-deprivation. overall, these data suggest the existence of a transcriptional regulatory network which responds to iron intake levels or other physiological signals associated with iron-deficiency in the mammalian intestine.

RESULTS
our overall data analysis approach is summarized in figure  <dig>  briefly, computational analysis of the gene chip data allowed us to identify  <dig> differentially expressed genes across our experimental groups. clustering analysis led to the identification of interesting gene clusters that could represent co-regulated genes. to determine potential regulatory mechanisms that lead to the upregulation of some genes during iron-deficiency, we performed tfbs enrichment analysis of promoters from our experimental genes across  <dig> mammalian species. for background frequency estimation, we used thousands of random promoter sequences from the same species. the final analysis allowed us to predict potential synergistic tf interactions that may be involved in regulating some of our experimental genes.

clustering analysis
 <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified across our experimental groups, including some genes that were up- or down-regulated in all groups studied and some genes that were regulated in as few as one experimental group. these genes are depicted visually in scatter plots shown in figure  <dig>  where up-regulated genes are seen as red dots and down-regulated genes are seen as green dots. from this representation, it is apparent that in suckling rats and in adult rat jejunum, there were no down-regulated genes that met the statistical cut-offs.

two different approaches were utilized to identify groups of potentially co-regulated genes, hierarchical and k-mean clustering. k-mean clustering led to three subsets of genes; one group was predominantly up-regulated, one group was mostly down-regulated and one group showed a mixed response . of particular interest was a group of  <dig> up-regulated probe sets , as this group contained several genes known to be involved in the genetic response to iron-deprivation, including dmt <dig>  cybrd <dig> and tfr. hierarchical clustering led to the identification of many groups of genes ; one cluster, which we called cluster  <dig>  contained  <dig> probe sets, representing  <dig> up-regulated genes. this cluster was contained within the  <dig> cluster and it also contained several genes involved in iron homeostasis . moreover, gene ontology  analysis of both the  <dig> up-regulated cluster and cluster  <dig> revealed statistical enrichment for gene functions related to iron and metal ion homeostasis , supporting the validity of our analyses.

iron-response element  analysis
transcripts representing genes in the  <dig> up-regulated cluster were analyzed for the presence of 3' ires, as ires in this part of the transcript could lead to message stabilization during iron-deficiency . we found 3' ires in only the dmt <dig> and tfr transcripts .

single transcription factor binding site  analysis
5' proximal promoters for available genes in the  <dig> up-regulated cluster were subjected to computational analysis to search for over-represented tfbss. the analysis results revealed a strong statistical enrichment for sp <dig> binding sites in our experimental promoters across  <dig> mammalian species, as compared to thousands of random promoter sequences from the same  <dig> species . four sp <dig> position weight matrices  were identified and all had very high raw scores, which mean that the identified binding sites are very similar to consensus binding sites  <cit> . while other pwms also showed significance in individual species , none except sp <dig> was significant across rat, mouse and human promoters. it should be noted that the transfac program has pwms for  sp <dig>  sp <dig> and  <dig> klf family members; however, there are over  <dig> sp/klf  proteins and many of them have high amino acid sequence homology in the dna binding regions  and they thus bind similar gc-rich regions  <cit> . utilizing a complimentary approach, it was further demonstrated that sp1-like binding sites were also enriched at the gene level, in that our group of experimental promoters had a higher percentage of genes with sp1-like sites than random samplings of background promoter sequences .

furthermore, analysis of promoter regions of genes within the  <dig> up-regulated cluster revealed many highly conserved, putative sp <dig> binding sites ; in many cases, the nucleotide sequence was identical and the spacing between predicted sites was very similar across mammalian species. our observations thus indicate that sp <dig> or a related factor may be involved in regulating a subset of genes in the  <dig> up-regulated cluster during iron-deficiency. in fact, a literature search of genes in this cluster with predicted sp <dig> sites that were conserved across three mammalian species revealed that previous investigation of many of these genes implicated sp <dig> in their transcriptional regulation . go analysis of these genes containing conserved, putative sp <dig> binding sites also revealed enrichment for gene functions related to iron and metal ion homeostasis .

qrt-pcr analysis of sp <dig> mrna expression
the genechip® studies revealed induction of sp <dig>  but not other sp/klf family members; therefore, we designed an experimental strategy to confirm this result. two different, specific sp <dig> primer sets were utilized for real-time pcr analyses, which demonstrated ~30-fold induction of sp <dig> mrna expression in the iron-deficient rat duodenum . we performed standard curves with each primer set, which showed that they were quantitative over a range of template dilutions . furthermore, in some experiments we treated rna samples with dnase  <dig> to remove genomic dna and found that amplification parameters and fold changes were very similar as to when we did not remove the genomic dna. melt curves demonstrated that single products were amplified by each primer set.

synergistic transcription factor binding site analysis
three sp <dig> pwms, v$sp1_q2_ <dig>  v$sp1_q4_ <dig> and v$sp1_q <dig>  were significant in the previous analyses at the binding site and gene levels, so we utilized these matrices to search for other tfs that may work in conjunction with an sp1-like factor to regulate intestinal genes during iron-deficiency. all three sp <dig> pwms gave similar results in that several tfbss were identified that were within the statistical parameters we established, including fox , hnf <dig>  krox, mzf <dig> and roaz . based upon these findings, we propose that sp <dig> or an sp1-like factor may work synergistically with one or more of these other tfs to mediate the genetic response to iron-deprivation. interestingly, we noted that both fox pwms and hnf <dig> binding sites were very similar, and that krox and mzf <dig> were highly similar to the predicted sp <dig> sites. we additionally noted that very few genes in the  <dig> up-regulated cluster contained roaz sites, despite the fact that this cluster contained a strong statistical enrichment for roaz and sp <dig> binding sites. it therefore was apparent that fox was our strongest candidate for synergistic action with sp <dig>  we were subsequently able to identify several genes in the up-regulated cluster with conserved sp <dig> and fox binding sites .

discussion
a well-characterized finding during iron-deficiency in mammals is that genes involved in iron-transport or iron-homeostasis are up-regulated. in some cases, increased gene expression may be mediated post-transcriptionally , but transcriptional mechanisms are also likely important  <cit> . this latter supposition is supported by the identification of iron and metal-responsive transcription factors from a number of lower species that mediate the cellular response to increased or decreased metal ion levels  <cit> .

analysis of a novel genechip® dataset resulted in the identification of  <dig> degs from the duodenum of iron-deficient rats at several postnatal ages, providing us with a unique opportunity to identify groups of induced genes that were potentially coordinately regulated and identify potential mechanisms that could be responsible for this common regulation. only  <dig> genes in our up-regulated cluster contained ires that could potentially mediate increases in steady state mrna levels. it thus emerged that other levels of regulation  were likely responsible for the alterations in the expression of this group of genes. we therefore focused on promoter analysis to identify potential candidate regulatory mechanisms.

gene promoters were identified by a combination of approaches, including manual analysis of probe set ids from the  <dig> probe sets in the large up-regulated cluster and blast searches that allowed us to analyse alternative genbank accession numbers for the corresponding cdnas, which we could link to a promoter sequence in the cold spring harbor database. background sequences were assembled as described in the methods section. transcription factor binding site  analysis utilized the clover program  <cit>  and the transfac professional database. results revealed several enriched tf binding sites, but sp <dig> was the only significant tfbs identified across  <dig> mammalian species. several putative sp <dig> matrices were identified and all had very high raw scores, indicating high similarity to consensus sp <dig> binding sites. we then employed additional approaches to consider whether sp <dig> or a related tf may be an important regulator of duodenal genes involved in the response to iron-deprivation.

testing for evolutionary conservation of tfbss often improves the ability to predict true binding sites from false positives, given that promoters in general show low nucleotide sequence homology across species except in regions that interact with gene regulatory proteins. we therefore determined the locations and specific sequences of the putative sp <dig> sites from the genes used for the enrichment analysis and compared them across rat, mouse and human. strikingly, the nucleotide sequences of the sp <dig> sites were highly conserved and often, multiple putative binding sites existed with the distances between them also conserved across species. this conservation of the sp <dig> sites was identified in ~ <dig> genes from the large cluster; the actual number of genes could be significantly higher though, as the curators of the cold spring harbor gene promoter database acknowledge that perhaps only 60% of their promoter sequences may be accurate.

sp <dig> is one of the first transcription factors to be purified, cloned and characterized from mammalian cells  <cit> , and is one of the most potent transcriptional activators identified to date  <cit> . sp <dig> plays important roles in a wide variety of physiological processes such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, hormonal activation, and angiogenesis, among others. sp <dig> has been shown to interact with gc- rich sites in various gene promoters via three cys2his <dig> zinc-finger motifs  <cit> . it is now clear that sp <dig> is a part of a large family of similar zinc-finger transcription factors  that includes  <dig> identified members in humans,  <dig> in mouse and  <dig> in rat  <cit> . like other trans-acting factors, sp <dig> has three functional domains: 1) a dna-binding domain, 2) a nuclear localization signal and 3) a transactivation domain that mediates protein-protein interactions that control transcriptional initiation. among sp <dig> family members, the dna binding domain is highly conserved  <cit> , while the transactivation domain varies widely between family members  <cit> . this high conservation in the dna binding domains suggests that many of the sp/klf family members bind highly similar dna sequences. our data thus suggests that sp <dig> or a related tf could be involved in regulating some of the genes in the  <dig> up-regulated cluster during  iron-deficiency.

comparison of genechip® data from the experimental animal groups considered in this manuscript along with another series of genechip® experiments performed in the belgrade rat model of genetic iron-deficiency , revealed that sp6/klf <dig> was induced during both dietary and genetic iron-deficiency. in fact, sp <dig> was one of <  <dig> genes that was induced in both models, utilizing stringent statistical analysis approaches. this intriguing observation was confirmed by qrt-pcr analyses that revealed a ~30-fold induction in adult, iron-deficient rats, including experiments performed with  <dig> different sets of sp6-specific primers. sp <dig> is a member of the sp/klf family that was originally identified by a bioinformatics scan of the human genome using the conserved zinc finger dna binding domains  <cit> . a subsequent study demonstrated the role of sp <dig>  in dental development in mice  <cit> . these authors suggested that sp <dig> binds highly gc-rich regions, similar to other members of the sp/klf family of dna binding proteins. besides this study however, very little is known about sp <dig> and its target genes. from the current studies we conclude that sp <dig> is highly induced during iron-deficiency, thus making it a strong candidate for being involved in the genetic response to iron-deficiency.

further analyses suggested that an sp1-like factor and fox tfs may function synergistically to regulate some genes during iron-deficiency. the presence of several genes in  the up-regulated cluster with sp1-like and fox binding sites strengthens this prediction. like the sp/klf transcription factors, the fox family of dna binding protein has multiple members  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, utilizing a unique genechip® dataset and a variety of computational approaches has allowed us to predict that some genes important for the response to iron-deficiency in the rodent intestine are transcriptionally regulated by sp <dig> or a related tf. this prediction combined with the experimental observation that sp6/klf <dig> is strongly induced by iron-deficiency suggests that sp <dig> could be involved in this genetic response. further computational analysis allows us to hypothesize that a fox family dna binding protein may also be involved in this regulation.
