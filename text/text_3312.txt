BACKGROUND
aging is one of the most complex biological processes that are regulated by both genetic and environmental factors, but its molecular basis remains largely unknown
 <cit> . senescence-accelerated mice  are a series of inbred strains developed from the akr/j strain, consisting of  <dig> senescence-prone strains  and  <dig> senescence-resistant strains 
 <cit> . compared with samr strains, which show normal senescence, samp strains exhibit accelerated-senescence phenotypes such as a short life span and early onset of various age-related pathological changes
 <cit> . these sam strains have therefore been used as a model to elucidate the mechanism of aging.

it has remained unknown why sam strains exhibit different phenotypes, even though they were derived from a common ancestor
 <cit> . genetic analyses by use of biochemical and immunological markers and endogenous murine leukemia virus  proviral markers revealed that each sam strain constitutes a genetically distinct group. comparisons of the sam strains with their parental akr/j strain indicated significant differences in genetic background between them, corroborating the hypothesis of the involvement of other strains, which underscores the probability of accidental outbreeding of the akr/j strain in the course of the development of sam
 <cit> .

despite intense characterization of sam strains, the genes responsible for accelerated senescence and pathologic changes in samp strains remain unidentified except for mutations in the apoa <dig>  sfrp <dig>  and fgf <dig> genes
 <cit> . xia et al. performed genotyping for  <dig> microsatellite markers in  <dig> established sam strains, and identified  <dig> loci that were different between the samp and samr strains
 <cit> , although the responsible genes remain unknown. furthermore, genetic analysis of crosses between the samp <dig> and samr <dig> strains also suggested that combinations of multiple gene mutations are responsible for the phenotypes
 <cit> .

recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have made it possible to rapidly determine the dna sequence of the whole genome of individual humans
 <cit> . as an alternative approach to whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing is an efficient strategy with regard to reducing the cost and workload
 <cit> . exome sequencing enables us to obtain information on functionally important coding regions. although this type of sequencing is useful for identification of the cause of mendelian disorders
 <cit> , it is difficult to explore genes responsible for complex traits by using this approach. the difficulty in identification of combined effects of various variants in humans is mainly ascribable to the presence of heterozygosity as well as homozygosity in humans
 <cit> . in contrast, inbred mouse strains such as sam strains are useful models to analyze the combined effects of genes because we can focus on homozygous variations only.

in the present study, we performed whole exome sequencing of  <dig> samp and  <dig> samr strains to identify the single-nucleotide variations  in their entire exomes. we hypothesized that the accelerated-senescence phenotypes and short life span observed in samp strains are caused by coding-region mutations that are present specifically in samp strains but are absent in the samr strains. we obtained a full view of the exome signature of sam strains and report herein several mutations that potentially cause various pathogenic phenotypes. our data demonstrate that this innovative approach, whole-exome sequencing, is paving the way to the unraveling of the genetic mechanisms of accelerated senescence and pathogenic phenotypes in mouse models.

RESULTS
whole-exome sequencing revealed exonic profiles of sam strains
whole-exome capture and next-generation sequencing were successfully performed on  <dig> mouse strains, i.e., samp1/skuslc, samp3/slcidr, samp6/taslc, samp8/taslc, samp10/taslc, samp11/slcidr, samr1/slcidr, samr1/taslc, samr3b/slcidr, akr/j, and c57bl/6j strains, and generated on average  <dig> million, single-end 50-bp reads per sample . the number of aligned reads was about  <dig> million including  <dig>  gigabases of sequence per sample, and the generated sequences achieved a mean read depth of  <dig>  ±  <dig> ×. on average,  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the target base pairs were covered by at least one read; and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the target base pairs were covered by at least  <dig> reads. after removal of low-quality reads, duplicates, and reads mapped out of targeted regions, snv detection was performed by use of avadis ngs ver <dig> . the whole-exome sequencing identified  <dig>  to  <dig>  snvs for samp strains,  <dig>  to  <dig>  for samr strains,  <dig>  for akr/j, and  <dig>  for c57bl/6j on targeted regions from the reference mouse genome sequence grcm <dig> . the number of snvs in c57bl/6j mice was much lower than that of those in the other strains, because the genome sequence of c57bl/6j was used as the reference for the mouse genome. these  <dig>  snvs in the c57bl/6j strain may be attributed to individual variability rather than to sequencing error. actually, several studies reported that minor genetic and phenotypic variations could be observed even among individual c57bl/6j mice
 <cit> . although the targeted regions included non-coding regions, we restricted our analysis to exonic snvs of  <dig>  to  <dig>  variants for samp strains,  <dig>  to  <dig>  for samr strains,  <dig>  for akr/j, and  <dig>  for the c57bl/6j strain. exonic snvs included  <dig>  to  <dig>  non-synonymous snvs for each sample except for c57bl/6j. moreover,  <dig> to  <dig> novel non-synonymous snvs were detected after comparison with the public database dbsnp <dig> and genome sequences of  <dig> inbred strains of laboratory mice
 <cit> . in the same way, novel multiple nucleotide variants , frame-shift mutations, and nonsense mutations were detected in each strain . we calculated the rates of false positive and false negative by validating  <dig> known and  <dig> novel snvs by using the sanger method . although the false-positive rate was 14% for novel snvs, the entire false-positive rate was  <dig> %, indicating that high-quality calls for homozygous snvs were gained.

no novel exonic mutations commonly detected among samp strains
surprisingly, we detected no novel mutations that were present in all of the samp strains, but absent in the other strains . when including the snvs previously reported in other strains,  <dig> snvs  were commonly detectable in all of the samp strains but absent in samr, akr/j and c57bl/6j strains . having examined the effects of snvs on protein function, we predicted ogg <dig> p.r304w to be deleterious by both sift and polyphen- <dig> programs , and mbd <dig> p.d129n to be deleterious only by the polyphen- <dig> program . we performed functional enrichment analysis to confirm whether common features could be detected among these  <dig> genes. go analysis showed that “base-excision repair”  was most significantly overrepresented . ogg <dig> and mbd <dig> genes were included among the entire top  <dig> of overrepresented go categories. only “response to stress” included alox <dig> in addition to ogg <dig> and mbd <dig> . we also checked whether these  <dig> genes had been reported to be associated with the aging process by referring to the genage database
 <cit> , but no such genes were recorded in the database .

*human protein sequence is in conflict with the mouse sequence at the position indicated.

the ogg <dig> p.r304w mutation was previously observed in all of the samp strains, but this same mutation was also detected in nzb/n, nfs/n, sjl/j, and nod/shiltj strains
 <cit> . the ogg <dig> gene encodes the enzyme 8-oxoguanine dna glycosylase, by which oxidatively modified bases are repaired
 <cit> . the methyl-cpg-binding domain protein, encoded by the mbd <dig> gene, is also a dna repair enzyme that is responsible for removing mismatched thymine or uracil within methylated cpg sites
 <cit> . similar to ogg <dig> p.r304w, mbd <dig> p.d129n was previously found in normal mice strains including 129p2/olahsd, 129s1/svimj, 129s5svevbrd, dba/2j, lp/j, nod/shiltj, and nzo/hlltj
 <cit> . it is interesting that all of the samp strains as well as the nod/shiltj strain share these genes that are involved in dna repair, i.e., ogg <dig> and mbd <dig>  nod/shiltj is a mouse model of type  <dig> diabetes, showing a short life span
 <cit> . nevertheless, we should be careful to conclude that the combination of these mutations regulates the accelerated-senescence phenotype of samp, because the short life span of nod/shiltj is generally attributed to diabetes caused by insulitis.

unique deleterious mutations identified in each substrain
we hypothesized that different disease phenotypes among samp strains are caused by deleterious snvs that are unique to each strain or a subgroup of strains. we focused on novel non-synonymous snvs specific to each strain. we extracted samp-specific novel non-synonymous snvs, after excluding mutations in olfactory-receptor and vomeronasal-receptor superfamily genes or in pseudogenes. in addition to nonsense and frameshift mutations, we focused on dysfunctional mutations predicted to be deleterious by sift or polyphen- <dig> programs. as the results, we detected  <dig> deleterious mutations. subsequently,  <dig> of these deleterious mutations were validated by sanger sequencing . among these  <dig> mutations, only  <dig> of them were shared by multiple strains , whereas the other  <dig> mutations were detected in only a single strain. functional enrichment analysis for the genes including these  <dig> mutations showed that “gap junction channel activity”  was the most significantly overrepresented . however, go category “aging” and its subcategories were not significantly overrepresented. we also confirmed that no genes including these  <dig> mutations were recorded in the genage database 
 <cit> .

†human protein sequence is in conflict with the mouse sequence at the position indicated.

*the score is low confidence because the prediction was based on sequences too closely related.

we also detected  <dig> novel deleterious mutations in samr strains . these results are not surprising, because it has been reported that samr strains exhibit several diseases such as non-thymic lymphoma, histiocytic sarcoma, and ovarian cysts
 <cit> , although the samr strains have been used as control groups against the samp strains. novel deleterious mutations including fbxl <dig> p.s734n, sh3bp5l p.r217w, tnrc6a p.a278v, and zkscan <dig> p.c232x were detected among all of the samp strains in addition to being found in several samr strains . these mutations may be associated with susceptibility to diseases in samp strains as well as in samr ones.

prx p.r167c mutation in samp <dig>  samp <dig>  and samp <dig> strains
interestingly, we detected deleterious mutations in several genes that had been earlier reported to be associated with severe genetic disorders in both humans and mice. for example, the prx p.r167c mutation  was detected in  <dig> samp strains . the prx gene encodes periaxin, a protein required for the maintenance of myelin
 <cit> . because myelin is necessary for the conduction of high-frequency and high-velocity nerve impulses by saltatory conduction, its defects lead to severe neuropathy. in humans, nonsense mutations in periaxin cause an autosomal recessive form of cmt4f , which is one of the severe hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies
 <cit> . it was also reported that periaxin-knockout mice exhibit peripheral demyelination, mechanical allodynia, and thermal hyperalgesia
 <cit> . the prx p.r167c mutation is located within the nuclear localization signal , which is necessary for this protein to be imported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm 
 <cit> . localization of periaxin in the nucleus is observed in murine embryonic schwann cells only for a limited period of time
 <cit> . because the arginine at position <dig> is highly conserved among mammalian species, this mutation in nls might disturb the transfer of periaxin into the nucleus, thereby adversely affecting the normal differentiation of schwann cells.

ldb <dig> p.r473w mutation in all of samp strains except for samp8
in the ldb <dig> gene, encoding lim domain-binding protein  <dig>  the p.r467w mutation  was detected in all of the samp strains except for samp8/taslc . ldb <dig> is a component of the sarcomere z disk protein complex expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles, and it is connected to calsarcin- <dig> and α-actinin
 <cit> . mutations in the ldb <dig> gene are responsible for myofibrillar myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy in humans
 <cit> . in addition, ldb <dig> exon  <dig> is aberrantly spliced in myotonic dystrophy type 1
 <cit> . pathological changes in skeletal and cardiac muscles of samp strains, however, have not been fully analyzed.

gja <dig> p.s405p mutation in samp <dig>  samp <dig>  samp <dig>  and samp <dig> strains
we detected the gja <dig> p.s405p mutation  in  <dig> samp strains . gap junction protein alpha  <dig>  encoded by gja <dig>  is specifically expressed in the plasma membrane of lens fiber cells to form gap junctions
 <cit> . gap junctions directly connect the cytoplasm of adjacent cells, and allow various molecules and ions to pass freely between cells, functioning for the maintenance of osmotic and metabolic balance in the avascular lens. a large number of studies have reported the association of mutations of the gja <dig> gene with cataract in humans
 <cit> .

il4ra p.s540fs and zdhhc <dig> p.r112c mutations in the samp <dig> strain
we next analyzed deleterious snvs unique to a single samp strain, i.e., not shared with other samp strains. we detected  <dig> deleterious mutations specific to the samp6/taslc strain, which has been used as a mouse model of osteoporosis or ulcerative colitis
 <cit> . among these  <dig> mutations, we focused on the il4ra p.s540fs frameshift mutation . the il4ra p.s540fs substitution immediately generates a stop codon at this position. osteoporosis is caused by bone resorption in excess of bone formation. the differentiation of osteoclasts is promoted by rankl, a membrane-bound cytokine, as well as by inflammatory cytokines such as tnf-α, il- <dig> and il-6
 <cit> . these proteins are mainly expressed in type  <dig> t-helper lymphocytes . il- <dig>  a th <dig> cytokine suppresses the formation of th <dig> cells to keep the proper balance between th1/th <dig> cytokines. a functional loss of the il4ra protein would lead to activation of th <dig> cells. therefore, both osteoporosis and ulcerative colitis in samp <dig> might be explained by activation of th <dig> cytokines, which would be induced by the il4ra p.s540fs frameshift mutation.

the zdhhc <dig> p.r112c mutation  was also detected uniquely in samp <dig> . zinc-finger dhhc domain-containing protein  <dig>  encoded by the zdhhc <dig> gene, has a predicted dhhc cysteine-rich palmitoyl acyltransferase domain
 <cit> . several gene mutations in the zdhhc family have been implicated in human diseases and abnormal phenotypes of mice. remarkably, zdhhc13-truncated mutant mice develop alopecia, osteoporosis, and systemic amyloidosis
 <cit> ; and the osteoporotic phenotype can be explained by the finding that protein palmitoylation regulates osteoblast differentiation through bone morphogenesis protein -induced osterix expression
 <cit> . thus we speculate that zdhhc <dig> p.r112c mutation might contribute to the osteoporotic phenotype in samp <dig> 

aifm <dig> p.k582n mutation specific to samp8
five detected deleterious mutations were unique to the samp8/taslc strain, which show deficits in learning and memory, emotional disorder, and abnormal circadian rhythm at early ages 
 <cit> . it is remarkable that the k582n mutation in the aifm <dig> gene , encoding apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrion-associated protein  <dig>  was detected in samp8/taslc. although the function of aifm <dig> has not been fully elucidated, it has been reported that aifm <dig> shares 35% homology with aifm <dig> and that overexpression of aifm <dig> induces apoptosis in hek  <dig> cells
 <cit> . because the lysine at  <dig> in aifm <dig> is highly conserved among mammalian species, this p.k582n mutation therefore may alter the function of aifm <dig>  contributing to the mitochondrial dysfunction in samp <dig> mice.

discussion
whole-exome sequencing identified new candidate mutations responsible for age-related phenotypes in samp strains
in the present study, we identified the entire spectrum of the snvs in  <dig> samp and  <dig> samr strains by whole-exome sequencing. we summarized the candidate mutations regulating various pathogenic phenotypes in samp strains in figure
 <dig>  our study has clarified that several disease-causing mutations were common among multiple samp strains. two of these mutations, ogg <dig> p.r304w and mbd <dig> p.d129n, were common among all samp strains and would be involved in the susceptibility to diseases via defects in dna repair. in all samp strains except samp8/taslc, we detected a p.r473w missense mutation in the ldb <dig> gene, which has been associated with myofibrillar myopathy. in  <dig> samp strains , we identified a p.r167c missense mutation in the prx gene, which has been linked to hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. in  <dig> samp strains , we detected a p.s405p missense mutation in the gja <dig> gene, which is a cause of cataract. as the candidate gene mutations responsible for strain-specific phenotypes, we detected  <dig> deleterious mutations specific to a single samp strain, including the il4ra p.s540fs frameshift mutation in samp6/taslc, which is used as a model for osteoporosis, and the aifm <dig> p.k582n mutation in samp8/taslc mice, which display deficits in learning and memory and mitochondrial dysfunction.

we detected ogg <dig> p.r304w and mbd <dig> p.d129n deleterious mutations, which were common to all of the samp strains, but absent in the samr and akr/j strains; although these  <dig> mutations were also detected in other mouse strains. it was already investigated as to whether a defect in ogg <dig> protein would affect the life spans in samp strains. mori et al. reported that hybrid mice with the homozygous mutation in ogg <dig> p.r304w exhibited a complete loss of the glycosylase activity as well as a higher level of 8-oxoguanine in their hepatic nuclear dna
 <cit> . however, the average life span of the samp1×b <dig> br hybrid was not different among the mice homozygous, heterozygous or nullzygous  for the samp <dig> allele. moreover, nzb/n, nfs/n, sjl/j, and nod/shiltj also have the ogg <dig> p.r304w mutation. these results suggest that ogg <dig> p.r304w alone is not sufficient to cause accelerated senescence and a short life span. we assume that the combination of ogg <dig> p.r304w and mbd <dig> p.d129n causes accelerated senescence. both mutations were detected in the nod/shiltj strain, which is a type  <dig> diabetes model
 <cit> . although nod/shiltj mice may live for only  <dig> to  <dig> months due to diabetes under normal food and water conditions
 <cit> , we cannot predicate these mutations to be essential for the accelerated-senescence phenotype of samp because the cause of death is different between samp and nod/shiltj strains. nevertheless, mouse strains that possess ogg <dig> p.r304w mutation are known for their pathologic phenotypes: nzb/n for autoimmune hemolytic anemia; sjl/j for reticulum cell sarcomas, in addition to nod/shiltj for type  <dig> diabetes
 <cit> . somatic mutations have been implicated in various diseases, and the accumulation of such mutations is one of the most accepted theories to explain aging. the ogg <dig> p.r304w mutation might partly contribute to the phenotypes of these mouse strains as well as to the accelerated-senescence phenotypes of samp strains.

in several samp strains, missense mutations were detected in the prx, ldb <dig>  and gja <dig> genes, which mutations have been found in various human degenerative diseases. the pathogenesis of myofibrillar myopathy and peripheral neurodegeneration has not been fully analyzed in samp strains. age-related muscle atrophy and a decline in peripheral neuronal function are assumed to be a common phenomenon that probably occurs in the course of the senescence process
 <cit> . nevertheless, genetic susceptibility to degeneration of skeletal muscle and peripheral neurons may be different among samp strains. prx p.r167c and ldb <dig> p.r473w mutations possibly contributed to the degenerative phenotypes of  <dig> of the samp strains in the course of the senescence process.

in the present study, the gja <dig> p.s405p mutation was detected in  <dig> samp strains , among which only the samp <dig> strain is reported to develop cataract
 <cit> . as a lack of reports of cataract in samp <dig>  samp <dig>  and samp <dig> does not indicate the actual lack of cataract, careful ophthalmologic examinations for cataracts in these  <dig> other samp strains may reveal a pathogenic association. alternatively, because it is suggested that the pathogenic mechanism underlying the development of cataract in samp strains is different from that of murine hereditary cataract, which is generally regulated by single-gene mutations
 <cit> , the gja <dig> mutation alone may not be sufficient to cause cataract. the samp <dig> strain may have additional mutations besides the gja <dig> p.s405p mutation that are responsible for cataract.

the il4ra p.s540fs frameshift mutation can explain the osteoporosis observed in the samp <dig> strain from the viewpoint of osteo-immunology. it is known that il- <dig> signaling inhibits osteoclast differentiation by suppressing th <dig> cytokines such as rankl, tnf-α, and il- <dig>  in fact, il <dig> gene knockout mice are sensitive to rankl-induced bone resorption
 <cit> . a defect in il4ra might thus enhance osteoclast differentiation due to dysregulation of th <dig> cytokines. the il4ra p.s540fs frameshift mutation can also explain the ulcerative colitis found in the samp <dig> strain. although the true cause of ulcerative colitis remains unknown, abnormalities of the immune system are possibly related to its pathogenesis. particularly, a high level of tnf-α was proposed to play an important role in disease progression
 <cit> . in samp <dig> mice, it is expected that up-regulation of tnf-α expression in the colon would occur due to activation of th <dig> cells. thus, both of these pathogenic phenotypes, osteoporosis and ulcerative colitis, may be ascribable to the defect in il4ra in samp <dig> 

we also detected the aifm <dig> p.k582n mutation in the samp8/taslc mice, which display deficits in learning and memory. high oxidative stress derived from brain mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be one of the causes of age-related neurodegeneration in samp <dig> animals. actually, decreased activities of nadh-cytochrome c reductase are observed even in 4-week-old samp <dig> mice, suggesting crucial defects in maintenance of the respiratory chain
 <cit> . aifm <dig> is likely to be related to mitochondrial maintenance, because it induces apoptosis in vitro and has an oxidoreductase domain, as is the case for aifm1
 <cit> , which plays roles in maintenance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
 <cit> . however, the actual roles of aifm <dig> in apoptosis in the senescence process and the actual substrates of the oxidoreductase remain unknown. further investigations are necessary to examine whether the aifm <dig> p.k582n contributes to deficits in learning and memory via dysfunction of brain mitochondria.

overall, it seems that the combinations of different disease-causing mutations specific to each strain cause various degenerative diseases, which combinations are a cause of short life spans of samp strains as far as focusing on the mutations of the coding regions is concerned. actually, it was reported earlier that the life spans of samp strains are susceptible to environmental conditions
 <cit> . these observations may be ascribable to the multifactorial nature of the short life span of samp unlike other progeroid mice whose life span is regulated by single gene mutation. de magalhaes jp et al. also reported that the gompertz mortality curve of the samp was not different from that of the samr prior to age  <dig> year despite the difference in age when 50% of mice died, suggesting that the life spans of the samp strains may not be related to aging per se <cit> . nevertheless, we think that it is premature to conclude that samp strains are degenerative disease models rather than accelerated-senescence models because in vitro studies have shown that primary-cultured cells from several samp strains show accelerated senescence and higher oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction than the samr <dig> strain
 <cit> .

limitation of the present study
whole-exome sequencing using 50-bp single-end reads on the solid <dig> platform is able to detect only single or 2-base nucleotide variations and insertion/deletion. because accelerated senescence and the various pathogenic phenotypes may not be explained completely by the nucleotide substitutions in the coding regions, we cannot ignore the possibility that other types of genetic variations are also involved in common accelerated-senescence phenotypes of samp strain. fairfield et al. succeeded in identifying causative mutations in several enu-induced mutants by exome sequencing, but failed to do so in several spontaneous disease models
 <cit> . they suggested that mutations responsible for spontaneous disease models might reside in the non-coding regions. actually, it has been proven that most of the non-coding regions have some biochemical functions
 <cit> .

carter et al. reported a 15-bp insertion mutation in the fgf <dig> gene in samp10
 <cit> , suggesting the involvement of a small structural variation in an exon of this gene. a long-read sequencing platform, which can generate over 200-bp fragments, would be required to detect them. it has been suggested that not only small structural variations in exons, but also large genomic structural variations such as copy number variations and gene translocations, contribute to the complex traits of humans
 <cit> . furthermore, because complementary rna probes are designed based on reference genome sequences, we were limited to find variants in comparison with the reference sequence. de novo assembly by whole genome sequencing or mate-pair library sequencing and comparative genomic hybridization  array analysis should be performed to detect these sequence variations.

in present study, we focused on only novel deleterious mutations that could be predicted by sift and polyphen- <dig>  although these bioinformatics tools are useful to narrow down the candidate mutations, a recent study indicated that sift and polyphen- <dig> show  <dig> and 79% correct prediction rates, respectively
 <cit> . in the future, functional analyses should be conducted to confirm whether the mutations that were predicted to be deleterious in the present study really affect the functions of these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
our study using whole-exome sequencing provides a list of candidate mutations that are potentially linked with various pathogenic phenotypes. as was shown in figure
 <dig>   <dig> deleterious mutations in the dna-repair genes, i.e., ogg <dig> p.r304w and mbd <dig> p.d129n, were commonly present among samp strains, which mutations would be expected to be involved in the genetic vulnerability to age-related diseases. under such genetic backgrounds, deleterious mutations detected in each substrain may cause various pathogenic phenotypes. we revealed that only  <dig> samp-specific non-synonymous mutations were shared among substrains, although the mechanisms and development of accelerated senescence and short life span have been assumed to be the same among all of samp strains. furthermore, several samp strains had deleterious mutations in the genes associated with hereditary diseases , which mutations have not been previously reported to occur in samp strains. these results suggest that comparison of age-related phenotypes among multiple samp strains and detailed histopathological reexamination are required. phenotypic reports of specific samp strains have been biased by the researchers’ interests. the current exome sequence data will prompt us to scrutinize yet unnoticed pathological features. in addition to the exome database, construction of the comprehensive genome database of samp and samr strains will contribute not only to a better understanding of the fundamental aging process occurring in sam strains but also to elucidation of the mechanisms of age-related diseases in humans as well as to the development of a more effective intervention against them.
