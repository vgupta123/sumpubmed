BACKGROUND
fueled by ever-growing demand, complete human mabs have become one of the most important disciplines for obtaining research and therapeutic leads. currently, the identification of such materials with desired specificities requires either selecting from artificial genetic ig libraries  <cit>  or immunizing transgenic mice that harbored large human ig loci  <cit> . unfortunately, because of their dependence on ig gene shuffling, information about the original pairing of heavy  and light  chains inherent in a single human b cell has been limited. an alternative strategy for obtaining complete human mabs would be to use combined heterotopic b- and t-cell epitopes as an immunogen in human lymphocyte cultures, followed by standard hybridoma and/or cloning procedures. initially, the validity of this site-directed in vitro immunization approach has been established in the procurement of gp120-specific monoclonal igm from seronegative, non-infected lymphocytes  <cit> . viral neutralizing, affinity maturated and isotype switched igg responses were subsequently confirmed in human naïve b lymphocytes  <cit> . however, from prior reports, it was unclear whether b-cell epitopes present on a self-protein would also elicit significant igg responses in the site-directed in vitro immunization regimen; therefore, a molecule with its existence on lymphocytes represents an ideal candidate for such a study.

cd <dig> belongs to a group of immunomodulating receptors, collectively termed as cd <dig> superfamily  <cit> , and represents one of the major inhibitory receptors involved in co-stimulatory pathways regulating both humoral and cellular immune response  <cit> . these inhibitory effects are due in part to a higher avidity of binding by the common endogenous agonists, b7- <dig>  and b7- <dig> , compared with its stimulatory homologue, cd <dig>  <cit> . the lurch toward cd <dig> of these agonists reduces t-cell proliferation and cytokine production, resulting in attenuated immune responses, and thus mediates tolerance and/or anergy  <cit> . cd <dig> has also been demonstrated to promote clonal anergy development by limiting cell cycle progression during the primary response in vivo  <cit> , thus cd <dig> opened up the possibility to study whether the current knowledge in site-directed in vitro immunization allows any generalizations to be made that will consequently be useful in developing human mabs against self ags.

structural findings indicate that the cd <dig> protein is composed of disulfide-linked homodimers of extracellular igv domains. each domain consists of two layered β-sheets with ten strands   <cit> . furthermore, one mutational  <cit>  and two crystallographic  <cit>  studies have independently pointed out that cdr1-like  and cdr3-like  regions in cd <dig> directly bind b <dig> ligands, whereas the role of cdr <dig> was very insignificant, if it played a part at all. in contrast to the harmonized results to the relative contribution of individual cdr's, a severe discrepancy existed even in the span of cdr <dig>  in the mutational model, the extracellular consecutive 51aatym <dig> motif was implicated to be cdr <dig>  <cit>  whereas co-crystallographic structures characterized the c'-c" loop encompassing a single met  <dig> as cdr <dig>  <cit> . to further complicate the picture of functionality, the downstream m <dig>  and m <dig>  epitopes, localized between the c" and d strands, have been revealed to play an important pharmacological role upon ab binding  <cit> . thus not only is the dimension of cdr <dig> controversial but also, additional domains potentially involved in certain functions of cd <dig> are suggested. the suggestion of an important contribution in this area defined by the met  <dig> core  is further strengthened by observing a considerable conservation across all identified cd <dig>  with six of the  <dig> amino acids having identical residues to the human sequence  <cit> .

here we explored the stimulating effect of the met 55-cored sequence by invoking the optimized process of site-directed in vitro immunization and somatic cell hybridization  <cit>  to target this particular area. we showed that human abs that are specific for the cdr2-encompassed met 55-cored region could be regularly generated in vitro from normal donors after sensitization with a heterotopic peptide. moreover, the resultant human igg4λ mab is useful to probe and label cdr <dig> in situ and ex situ during the responses involving such a particular self molecule.

RESULTS
procuring the desired ab response by site-directed in vitro immunization and electrofusion
plasma samples from repeated healthy donors were initially screened for igg and igm against tetanus toxoid, rhcd <dig> and mouse igg2a by elisa. it was found that no donors  had any significant igm or igg responses to cd152; however, anti-tetanus toxoid igg  and some, albeit low, levels of specific igg antibody against mouse igg2a  were found. after primary and secondary in vitro immunization of five pbmc's from individual donors, the respective ebv-activated lymphoblastoid cultures were screened for human igs against cd <dig>  when assayed by elisa, frequencies of specific cultures detected in the lymphoblastoid cells after primary in vitro immunization ranged from 0% to above 3% and were significantly elevated when cd8+ and cd56+cells were simultaneously removed before primary peptide stimulation .

as shown in additional file  <dig>  although there was not a statistically significant increase, the removal of il-10+ cells before secondary peptide stimulation yielded the highest frequency of specific igg-producing cells.

wells containing anti-cd <dig> igg level that was five times higher than anti-murine igg2a were subsequently pooled for electrofusion. one fusion yielded eleven clones secreting anti-cd <dig> abs. three of them were subcloned and found to be of the igg <dig> isotype. to select a mab for further characterization, two parameters were taken into account: the secretory capacity of the trioma, estimated from the elisa titer and the relative specificity, reflected by the reactivities to other unrelated antigens such as tetanus toxoid, bovine serum albumin, and uncoated wells. figure 1b also demonstrates that the selected monoclonal had a near-background reaction with unrelated ags. long-term  stable ab production in a concentration above  <dig> μg/ml/ <dig> trioma cells in spent medium was consistently observed.

presentation of recognized epitope on mitogen-activated human t cells and the immunogen
to investigate whether the specificity observed in elisa was also applicable for the activated human t cells in situ, we used the mitogen-dependent stimulation system, where peripheral t cells were activated with anti-cd <dig>  pha, cona, or the combination of pma/ionomycin or pha/pma. cd152-expressing t cells were numerated in cd3+ population by flow cytometry. after a 72-h culture period, few cd3+ t cells without stimulation were stained by our human mab whilst a large number of cd152+cd3+ t cells were constantly observed after activation with pma and pha . control human igg4λ myeloma protein failed to distinguish among the activation statuses and the present mab did not react with activated murine cd3+ t cells .

to further characterize the nature of mab binding, epitope mapping was performed by the western blotting method with arrays containing the overlapping pendecapeptides, encompassing cdr1-like , cdr3-like  and the met 55-cored sequence localized between the c' and d strands of the cd <dig> extracellular portion. figure  <dig> depicts that only the peptide corresponding to the c-terminus of the met 55-cored sequence  was best recognized by the mab while neither the promiscuous t-cell epitope, nor cdr1-like or cdr3-like region contributes to the binding. from this result, it can be concluded that the ala  <dig>  ala  <dig>  thr  <dig> and thr  <dig> are not essential for mab recognition.

immunological and physicochemical properties of the mab
the mab was isotyped and subtyped by solid phase elisa, utilizing its reactivity with human cd <dig> and appropriate immobilized typing abs. the binding depicts the simultaneous presence of γ <dig> and λ chains in the mab while other ig chains are absent , thus the mab was termed as γ4λhucd <dig>  additionally, to compare the clonal nature with existing human monoclonal igg1λ and igg4λ derived from purified myeloma proteins, the isoelectric focusing  patterns were subsequently visualized. the resolvable bands, as shown in figure 3b, indicate that γ4λhucd <dig> has a slightly lower yet basic pi similar to the igg1λ, but in contrast to the acidic igg4λ myeloma protein or to the anionic  species of proteins commonly described for polyclonal igg <dig>  <cit> . western blot confirmed the purity of the ab samples as illustrated by the anti-λ staining configurations. as shown in figures 3b, the corresponding pi of the myeloid igg1λ, igg4λ and γ4λhucd <dig> obtained with linear regression of ph gradient were  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig> , respectively.

the equilibrium dissociation constant  for the purified intact γ4λhucd <dig> was determined by an iasys analysis. the rate constant was evaluated directly from the sensogram using five cycles of soluble mab binding to the immobilized cd152-muig. figure 3d reveals that, with the analysis of extent and association in single phase, the kd was deduced to be  <dig> × 10- <dig> m.

ig sequences
following elelectrofusion and subsequent clonings, stable trioma cells producing igg4λ were selected and the cdna encoding the ig variable regions were cloned and sequenced. by comparing the vh with the available ig sequences, it was concluded that the vh, being  <dig> %  amino acid identity , is associated with three human vh <dig> germline segments . alignments have also disclosed homology of vl to three existing human vλ germline genes  with a measure of  <dig> % similarity . high similarity to accessible v germline genes of human but not other origins is indicative of complete human ab. moreover, both vh  and vl  regions contained evidence of hyper mutations away from the germline.

little or no competition to b7- cd <dig> binding of γ4λhucd <dig> both ex situ and in situ
although the cdr2-containing epitope does not seem to be involved in the binding of endogenous cognate ligands  and mab engagement would not be antagonistic, the epitope might present an allosteric site for non-competitive inhibition. to investigate this possibility, ctla-4-muig was immobilized onto wells and either biotinylated cd80-muig or cd86-muig was used as a binding ligand in the presence of γ4λhucd <dig> or bni <dig>  i.e., a cd <dig> antagonistic mouse igg2a mab  <cit> . figure 5a shows, in contrast with the expected dose-dependent inhibition of specific receptor binding by the antagonistic bni <dig>  γ4λhucd <dig> could not compete binding significantly with either cd80-muig or cd86-muig ex situ. no clear difference in binding was found when competing cd80-muig or cd86-muig was used in the binding of γ4λhucd <dig> to ctla-4-muig . surprisingly, high doses of γ4λhucd <dig> mab display synergism with the natural ligand cd <dig> but not cd <dig> with a consequence up to 50% enrichment of cd <dig> binding to ctla-4-muig.

in order to investigate the binding effects more thoroughly, and to provide further information on their possible in situ relevance, it was assessed whether labeling of endogenous cd <dig>  a known rare ag expressed only on activated t cells, by different mabs, influences the profile of detection. a well-contrasted cytometric picture of total cd152-binding and a clearly distinguishable concentrated pattern of labeling were evidenced on pha/pma-activated t cells by using γ4λhucd <dig>  indicating a lower nonspecific binding over the antagonistic bni <dig> . hence, non-ligand competitive γ4λhucd <dig> could be used as a new and refined probe which should be useful for sensitive assay and localization of cd <dig> both in situ and ex situ.

discussion
previously published techniques for in vitro immunization required pre-treatment of pbmc with chemotoxic agents, such as l-leucyl-l-leucin methyl ester hydrobromide , in order to prevent the "suppressing populations" dominating the response  <cit> . unfortunately, residual cytotoxicity and relative redundancy of leuleuome interferes with subsequent survival and peptide-driven stimulation and therefore the process requires careful timing for the greatest effectiveness. it was found that when abs were used as more selective reagents to specific removal of cd56+ and il-10+ cells, no leuleuome pretreatment is necessary . advantages of this improved procedure over the conventional procedure are clearly illustrated in the present study, not only in the reduction in sample manipulation, but also in successfully targeting human ab responses to a pre-determined epitope without the use of experimental animals or sensitized donors. we believe this first reported human mab directed against a self physiological receptor also signifies a constructive method for recruiting and unleashing the responses to physiological receptors that may not be recognized by donors' own immune system in vivo.

we found that the ex situ cd <dig> binding of cd <dig> increased with the increasing concentration of γ4λhucd <dig> . whether this observation also applied in situ is yet to be verified. however, human non-antagonistic anti-cd <dig> scfv fragments, obtained from a synthetic phage library, were indeed documented to synergize with cd80–cd <dig> but not cd86–cd <dig> association  <cit> , although to a less extent as compared with the present study. as described above, the cdr2-like met 55-cored epitope, 54ymmgneltflddsic <dig>  on cd <dig> may not be directly involved in the binding of cd <dig> but the f-g  and b-c  loops provide direct contacts and additional stabilization to cd <dig>  respectively  <cit> . thus cd80–cd <dig> binding enhancement by γ4λhucd <dig>  may be attributed to an extended protrusion of the cdr3-like region that facilitates cd <dig> engagement, or to a further segmentation that fixes the relative orientation of the binding domains for an additional spacing selectivity. these possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

despite the fact that the present mab was derived from healthy human donors, several mouse mabs with similar, but not identical, binding specificities were previously available in literature. for example, mabs with agonist- or antagonist-like activities against human cd <dig> were obtained from mice immunized with the recombinant receptor or mitogen-activated human pbmcs in  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> . in the earlier case, the epitopes responsible for the functional activity of the abs were finely identified. this analysis documented that the cdr2-adjacent epitope  and the conformational or cdr <dig> epitope  are responsible for agonist- and antagonist-like activities, respectively. in addition, using a bispecific tandem single-chain variable fragment recognizing 59elt <dig> and 66sict <dig>  another study has revealed a likely cd <dig> inverse agonist of ab nature  <cit> . ultimately systematic studies are needed to clarify the pharmacological effects of the present human monoclonal igg4λ with an epitope of a comparable stride .

a conspicuous feature of the present findings is that it is now possible to screen and construct isotype-switched, high affinity human mabs with pre-defined specificities than previously possible. consequently, mabs are able to mimic ligands action commonly found in small synthetic molecules and to facilitate comprehensive receptor-based drug designs. another peculiarity, as figure 3a shows the simultaneous presence of igg4fc and cλ human ig chains associated with the specificity, is that γ4λhucd <dig> can be described as a comparable if not a fundamentally authentic human igg <dig>  because igg <dig> does not activate the complement cascade and it is much more compact than other igg's  <cit> , accentuating its advantages for acting in the immunological synapse where a spatial limitation is applied  <cit> . although the current example comes from cd <dig>  obviously it can also apply to other biological receptors and their cognate ligands.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we started with an improved, more selective in vitro immunization protocol and worked toward fully human mabs against a representing self ag, cd <dig>  considerable progress has thus been made in this area as a result of a novel human igg4λ mab against cd <dig>  the application of such a mab with designated cdr <dig> specificity may impact upon and favor cd <dig> detection and/or isolation of human cd4+cd25+cd152+ regulatory t cells  <cit> . the present study also opens up the possibility of probing and perhaps controlling t cell activation using highly specific, less immunogenic ig proteins. further deciphering the biological functions mediated by γ4λhucd <dig> may lead to a greater understanding of the regulation and differentiation of immune responses.
