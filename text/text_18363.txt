BACKGROUND
interactions between proteins play an essential role in nearly every cellular process. each protein in a cell is estimated to interact with approximately five other proteins, forming a complex interaction network  <cit> . a better understanding of protein-protein interactions, in particular what regulates rates of formation and dissociation and the molecular basis of specificity, would have applications ranging across fields from protein engineering to drug design  <cit> . numerous protein-protein interactions have been studied and provide details about the roles of shape complementarity, long- and short-range interactions and solvent in binding . however, even with this large accumulation of data, prediction programs often have limited success, largely because of challenges posed by cooperativity between residues, flexibility, and rearrangement at the large, multifaceted interface upon binding  <cit> . some success has been shown for predicting changes upon mutation to alanine; however, predicting the effects of mutations to the other  <dig> amino acids often falls short because residues other than alanine lose interactions and also have the ability to form new ones. it is important to understand how mutations to all possible amino acids modify protein-protein interactions for protein engineering and because mutations other than alanine are frequently seen in nature.

various protein-protein complexes such as blip and β-lactamases have developed into model systems to examine the basic principles underlying protein-protein interactions . studies of a variety of protein complexes indicate that only a subset of residues at the interface contributes substantially to binding affinity and these residues are termed “hot spots” . specificity determinants, i.e., residues where energetic contributions vary depending on the binding partners, were found among the hot spot residues in the blip-β-lactamase interaction  <cit> . specificity determinants are of particular interest because of their ability to exhibit a significantly different effect on binding affinity to different protein binding partners when mutated. for example, when blip tyr <dig> was mutated to alanine it exhibited a 50-fold increase in binding affinity for one binding partner  and a 65-fold decrease in binding affinity for another    <cit> .table  <dig> binding constants of blip and blipy50a for class a β-lactamases

the current study focuses on further examination of the specificity determinant blip tyr <dig> in the interaction of blip with various class a β-lactamases. blip is a  <dig>  kda protein produced from the soil bacterium streptomyces clavuligerus that inhibits class a β-lactamases with varying affinities   . class a β-lactamases hydrolyze the commonly prescribed β-lactam antibiotics rendering them inactive  <cit> . the production of β-lactamases is the most common mechanism of bacterial resistance in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . blip inhibits class a β-lactamases by docking its predominantly polar, concave surface onto the enzyme, burying approximately  <dig>  Å <dig> of surface area  <cit> . blip competitively inhibits class a β-lactamases via two binding loops that occlude the active site of the enzymes   <cit> . the tertiary structures of class a β-lactamases are homologous but the sequences vary in identity from 30-70%    <cit> .fig.  <dig> structural representation of the interaction between blip and β-lactamases. blip is shown as a purple ribbon with tyr50blip shown as stick. tem- <dig> a and kpc- <dig> b β-lactamases are shown as white spheres with the catalytic ser <dig> in yellow and positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  are shown in red. pdb codes: 1jtg and 3e2k. alignment of apo  and bound  tem- <dig> c and kpc- <dig> d structures shown in ribbon with position 105β-lactamase shown as stick. blipy <dig> is shown as a purple stick in the bound form. the measurement provides the distance 105β-lactamase moves upon binding to blip. pdb codes 1btl and 2ov <dig>  and 1jtg and 3e2k . images generated with chimera

blip positions tyr <dig>  glu <dig>  lys <dig> and tyr <dig> were previously identified as specificity determinants in that substitutions at these positions result in large changes in the relative affinity of blip for various class a β-lactamases  <cit> . blip tyr <dig> resides on the 46- <dig> loop that contains two hotspots for binding – asp <dig> and tyr <dig>  <cit> . a concerted rearrangement occurs at both interfaces upon binding of blip and tem- <dig> β-lactamase; of particular interest, tem- <dig> tyr <dig> rearranges upon complex formation to relieve a steric clash with blip tyr <dig>   <cit> . in addition, residue  <dig>  which is tryptophan in kpc- <dig> β-lactamase, is in a similar position as tyr <dig> of tem- <dig> and also undergoes a rearrangement in the blip-kpc- <dig> complex   <cit> . this rearrangement of β-lactamase position  <dig> may be a contributing factor to changes in binding affinity upon mutation of blip tyr <dig>  blip tyr <dig> forms van der waals contacts with the β <dig> strand of tem- <dig> and kpc- <dig>  and also interacts directly with positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> on the β-lactamase interface   <cit> . a structural alignment of the positions on the β-lactamase interface is shown in fig.  <dig> with tem- <dig> and kpc- <dig> from the apo form and bla <dig> from a blip-ii bound form as no apo structure of bla <dig> is available  <cit> . β-lactamase positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have the same sequence and similar structure for bla <dig> and kpc- <dig> while tem- <dig> differs at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . as discussed above and seen in fig.  <dig>  the tyr <dig> and trp <dig> residues of tem- <dig> and kpc- <dig> are in a similar position in apo forms of the enzyme. the tyr <dig> residue of bla <dig> is in an altered position in the structural alignment, however, this is likely due to the structure originating from the blip-ii-bla <dig> complex   <cit> .

in this study, the effect of systematic substitutions at blip tyr <dig> is examined using kinetic analysis to determine how specificity can be modulated for binding tem- <dig>  kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> β-lactamases. these experiments were also performed computationally to assess the current success rate of an available protein binding prediction program. a deeper understanding of the interactions of blip with β-lactamases offers an opportunity to explore how specificity can be introduced into proteins rationally, by design.

RESULTS
determination of inhibition constants for β-lactamases
blip y <dig> was substituted to all  <dig> amino acids to investigate the role of this residue in modulating specificity. the mutant proteins were purified  and assayed with tem- <dig>  kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> β-lactamases to determine the inhibition constants . it was previously reported that the blip y50a substitution alters the binding specificity for β-lactamases; however, the extent to which other substitutions at position  <dig> alter binding specificity is unknown. overall, the results of this study support the hypothesis that blip y <dig> makes important contributions to the binding specificity of blip for class a β-lactamases.table  <dig> inhibition constants of blipy <dig> mutants for class a β-lactamases

blip is a potent inhibitor of each of the β-lactamases studied with ki values of  <dig>  nm for tem- <dig>   <dig>  nm for kpc- <dig> and  <dig>  nm for bla <dig> . the effect of substitutions at blip y <dig> on the binding affinity for the enzymes, however, is widely different. most blip y <dig> substitutions retain tight binding for kpc- <dig> while many substitutions reduce binding to tem- <dig> and the majority of substitutions are detrimental for binding bla <dig> . this is apparent from the finding that only  <dig> substitutions result in a greater than 10-fold loss in affinity for kpc- <dig> while  <dig> substitutions reduce binding by >10-fold for tem- <dig> and  <dig> result in a >10-fold loss in affinity for bla <dig> . the changes in binding constants for the substitutions were normalized by calculating the changes in free energy of the complex using the following equation: ΔΔg = -rt ln  . a negative ΔΔg value is indicative of an increase in binding affinity as compared to wild type while a positive value corresponds to a decrease in binding affinity. using these values, the wide difference in tolerance to blip y <dig> substitutions for binding β-lactamases is clear in that the average effect of substitutions  on binding kpc- <dig> was  <dig>  kcal/mol while that for binding tem- <dig> was  <dig>  kcal/mol and that for binding bla <dig> was  <dig>  kcal/mol . these results indicate that the sequence requirements at blip position  <dig> are significantly less stringent for binding kpc- <dig> compared to the requirements for binding tem- <dig> and bla <dig> table  <dig> ΔΔg values for class a β-lactamases and blip y <dig> mutants

examination of the substitution results in tables  <dig> and  <dig> reveals some common sequence requirements at blip position  <dig> for binding all three β-lactamases. for example, cysteine, phenylalanine and lysine substitutions showed a greater than 10-fold decrease in binding affinity for all three enzymes . cysteine may decrease binding affinity because of the potential of being oxidized, which would disrupt binding. phenylalanine has a similar van der waals volume as the wild-type tyrosine residue but does not have the hydrogen bonding capacity and could potentially interrupt the organization of structural waters at the interface because of its strong hydrophobic properties. the decrease in binding affinity when lysine is substituted at blip position  <dig> is likely due to introduction of an unpaired charge in the interface. although lysine was the only charged residue to globally decrease binding affinity by 10-fold, the general finding is that charged residues at position  <dig> result in a decrease in binding affinity for all β-lactamases tested, although the effect is less pronounced for binding kpc- <dig> . this is supported by the fact that blip containing arginine, glutamate or aspartate at position  <dig> exhibited decreased affinity for tem- <dig> and bla <dig> by greater than 100-fold and also exhibited decreased affinity for kpc- <dig> . a proline at position  <dig> is also generally disruptive in that it decreased the binding affinity of blip for all three β-lactamases, possibly by altering the conformation or flexibility of the y <dig> loop, which includes two hot spot residues for binding  <cit> .

another common trend for binding all three β-lactamases is that substitutions of blip y <dig> by the small amino acids alanine and glycine either does not affect or improves affinity . for example, blip y50a retains affinity for kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> and exhibits 50-fold tighter binding of tem- <dig> while y50g shows a small increase in affinity for all three enzymes. as noted above and shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  tyr <dig> in tem- <dig> and the equivalent trp <dig> in kpc- <dig> change position in the blip-β-lactamase complexes compared to the apo-enzymes in order to avoid a steric clash with blip y <dig>  it is possible that substitution of y <dig> with alanine or glycine avoids the clash and allows β-lactamase residue  <dig> to retain its apo-position in the complex, which may result in improved affinity.

finally, polar residue substitutions at blip y <dig> have quite disparate effects on binding the β-lactamases. for example, serine and threonine substitutions have relatively small effects on binding kpc- <dig> and tem- <dig> but result in greatly decreased binding to bla <dig> . in addition, glutamine at blip position  <dig> does not affect binding to any of the β-lactamases while an asparagine substitution results in decreased affinity for all three β-lactamases, including a greater than 10-fold decrease for binding tem- <dig> and bla <dig> . this result cannot easily be explained because asparagine has similar properties to glutamine, which had little to no effect on binding any of the β-lactamases.

impact of blip y <dig> on binding specificity
because the purpose of this study was to examine the role of blip position  <dig> as a specificity determinant, substitutions that have differential effects on binding are of interest. as indicated above and is apparent in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  many substitutions at blip y <dig> have differential effects on β-lactamase binding, the most clear example being the numerous substitutions that retain or modestly impact binding to kpc- <dig> while greatly decreasing binding to bla <dig> , and the subset of substitutions that retain binding to kpc- <dig> and tem- <dig> while losing affinity for bla <dig> . in contrast, there are no blip y <dig> substitutions that retain affinity for bla <dig> while losing affinity for kpc- <dig> or tem- <dig> . thus, the large differences in stringency of sequence requirements at position  <dig> results in blip variants that bind kpc- <dig> but not tem- <dig> and bla <dig> as well as those that bind kpc- <dig> and tem- <dig> but not bla <dig>  however, substitutions at blip y <dig> do not produce a variant that binds bla <dig> but not tem- <dig> or kpc- <dig> 

it was next of interest to examine a possible structural basis for the observed differences in sequence requirements for blip y <dig> substitutions for binding bla <dig> versus kpc- <dig> and tem- <dig>  the side chain of blip y <dig> is in direct contact with β-lactamase residues  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the crystal structures of the blip-tem- <dig> and blip-kpc- <dig> complexes . these β-lactamase contact residues are identical between kpc- <dig> and bla <dig>  while tem- <dig> differs at  <dig> of the  <dig> positions  . based on these sequences, it would be expected that substitutions at blip y <dig> would have similar effects on binding kpc- <dig> and bla <dig>  the results indicate this is clearly not the case. therefore, a simple comparison of the β-lactamase contact residues for blip y <dig> does not explain the observed differences in effects of substitutions on binding the β-lactamases. although kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> have the same amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the overall sequence identity of all β-lactamase residues at the interface is higher between bla <dig> and tem- <dig> compared to kpc- <dig> . there are a total of  <dig> positions  on the β-lactamase interface where tem- <dig> and bla <dig> have the same sequence and the sequence of kpc- <dig> differs . kpc- <dig> is much better at accommodating changes at blip y <dig> than both bla <dig> and tem- <dig> and has the most sequence differences at the interface. therefore, more widespread differences in the entire interface may influence the effect of substitutions at blip y <dig>  this may be due to changes at the interface induced by mutation of blip y <dig> that propagate outside of its local environment. in fact, previous studies have shown that blip tyr <dig> is energetically coupled to both positions tyr <dig> and glu <dig>  which are not in direct contact with tyr <dig>  <cit> . the hypothesis that changes at position  <dig> are influenced by other sites in the interface and vice versa is consistent with previous observations of structural plasticity and cooperativity of the blip interface upon mutation  <cit> . for example, it has been shown that the blip w150a mutation induces a greater than 4 Å shift in residue asp <dig>  demonstrating both structural flexibility of the loop containing tyr <dig> and long distance coupling at the blip interface  <cit> .

an interesting question is whether there are also more stringent sequence requirements at other blip positions in the interface for binding bla <dig> versus tem- <dig> and kpc- <dig>  a previous alanine-scanning mutagenesis study for  <dig> blip residues that contact β-lactamase in the bound complex evaluated binding to tem- <dig> and bla <dig>   <cit> . the results of this study suggest that the sequence requirements are not generally more stringent for blip binding bla <dig> in that the average ΔΔg effect for the  <dig> alanine substitutions was less detrimental for binding bla <dig>  than for tem- <dig>   <cit> . therefore, the stringent sequence requirements observed here for bla <dig> binding are unique to position  <dig> and not a general property of all interface positions for binding bla <dig> 

comparison of experimental and predicted ΔΔg values
it is appealing to use computational methods to guide engineering of binding specificity in protein-protein interactions. therefore, we were interested to examine how computational methods compared to our experimental results. the same mutagenesis experiment was performed computationally on blip position  <dig> with the beatmusic server, which computes theoretical ΔΔg values based on a set of statistical potentials derived from known protein structures  <cit> . the tem-1-blip  and kpc-2-blip  complexes were submitted for analysis. the blip-bla <dig> interaction was not analyzed because there is currently no crystal structure available of this complex.

the ΔΔg values generated by the beatmusic server and the experimentally determined ΔΔg values are plotted in fig.  <dig>  the average predicted ΔΔg value for the tem-1/blip interaction was  <dig>  kcal/mol while the experimentally determined average ΔΔg value was  <dig>  kcal/mol. for the kpc-2-blip interaction, the average predicted ΔΔg was  <dig>  kcal/mol and the experimentally determined average ΔΔg was  <dig>  kcal/mol. therefore, the beatmusic server was more accurate at predicting ΔΔg values for the blip-tem- <dig> interaction than the blip-kpc- <dig> interaction.fig.  <dig> comparison of experimental and predicted ΔΔg values for blip y <dig> variants. a comparison of the experimental and predicted ΔΔg values of the blip y50x mutants for binding tem- <dig> are shown on the top panel. a comparison of the experimental and predicted ΔΔg values of the blip y50x mutants for binding kpc- <dig> are shown on the bottom panel. the beatmusic server was used to generate predicted ΔΔg values. the predicted values are shown in red and the experimental values are shown in black





discussion
specificity determinants are often identified through alanine scanning of interface residues . whether mutations to other amino acids would also identify these residues as specificity determinants is unknown. here, we present data supporting the role of blip y <dig> as a specificity determinant and furthermore, provide evidence that this position can be targeted to engineer binding specificity of blip for a range of class a β-lactamases.

the beatmusic server did not predict any negative changes in free energy meaning that the energy of the wild-type complex is predicted to be more stable than any of the mutants. however, the blip y50a substitution was shown experimentally to bind tem- <dig> β-lactamase 50-fold tighter than wild type blip. it is known that some residues rearrange upon binding of blip and class a β-lactamases and this could influence the accuracy of the prediction programs  <cit> . these rearrangements could play into the differences seen  between our experimental ΔΔg values and the predicted values. furthermore, blip y <dig> is located on a loop that has two hot spots for binding; therefore, even small alterations in the placement of this loop induced by y <dig> substitutions could result in large changes in binding affinity. in addition, as described above, the effect of substitutions at blip y <dig> may be influenced by positions outside of the direct contact residues through coupled interactions and therefore predictions of effects of substitutions poses a significant challenge for computational prediction programs. however, it may be these same properties that provide blip with its unique ability to bind structurally homologous proteins with a wide-range of affinities.

because blip binds homologous β-lactamase structures that only differ by small changes in sequence at the interface, the blip-β-lactamase system is useful for examining how sequence dictates binding affinity. however, an alignment of the β-lactamase sequences in direct contact with the blip y <dig> residue  suggests that kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> would exhibit the same changes in binding affinity upon mutation of blip y <dig> because they have the same amino acids in similar conformations at these positions; however, this was not the case . although kpc- <dig> and bla <dig> have the same amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that directly interact with y <dig>  the overall sequence identity of all β-lactamase residues at the interface is higher between bla <dig> and tem- <dig> compared to kpc- <dig> . kpc- <dig> was much better at accommodating changes at blip y <dig> than both bla <dig> and tem- <dig> and had the most sequence differences at the interface. this suggests that simply comparing sequence identity of positions that make direct interactions with blip y <dig>  is not sufficient to predict changes in binding affinity upon mutation. therefore, more widespread differences in the entire interface may influence the effect of substitutions at blip y <dig>  this may be due to changes at the interface induced by mutation of blip y <dig> that propagate outside of its local environment due to structural plasticity and coupled interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
properties such as structural plasticity and cooperativity between residues are important for mediating protein interactions and critical for allosteric regulation in various cell processes . understanding how these properties contribute to binding specificity would greatly improve current protein binding prediction programs. this is an active area of investigation in g-protein coupled receptors, the human growth hormone receptor and other proteins . numerous studies such as these have established that the dynamic nature of proteins is critical to binding and proper functioning; however, this dynamic nature is challenging to predict and structurally understand, as flexible proteins are inherently difficult to model and crystallize. here, we demonstrate the complexity of predicting the impact of substitutions using the well-studied blip-β-lactamase protein-protein interaction model. furthermore, we have shown that surveying sequence homology and the structural interface of a complex are not sufficient in predicting the impact of mutations.

currently, protein prediction programs are unable to reliably predict changes in binding affinity upon mutation at the protein interface. systematic studies such as these could improve the current state by providing experimental data to be incorporated into these programs. lastly, there is a pressing need for new detection methods for β-lactamases, which are a widespread source of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. identification of specificity determinants in blip could be useful in the development of blip-based diagnostic reagents that can discriminate between class a β-lactamases and inform treatment options for clinicians.
