BACKGROUND
transposon-mediated germ-line transformation of insects is a powerful technique for investigating gene function  <cit>  and is also being used for the development of insect strains suitable for area-wide control programs  <cit> . piggybac is a type ii  transposon from the cabbage looper moth trichoplusia ni  <cit> . transposons related to piggybac are found in the genomes of almost all eukaryotes  <cit>  and piggybac has recently been shown to be able to transpose in mammalian  cells as well as in the mouse germline  <cit> . vectors based on the piggybac element have been used for germ-line transformation of a wide range of insect species including coleoptera, dipteran, hymenopteran and lepidopteran species  <cit> . an analysis of  <dig>  insertion events into the drosophila genome found that integration was non-random but had a broader distribution than found with the p element  <cit> . in particular piggybac did not show the bias for 5' regulatory regions seen with the p element. the site of integration, however, can influence transgene expression. integration near to a tissue-specific transcription enhancer can lead to transgene expression in tissues and/or stages other than intended  <cit> . additionally, integration into a heterochromatic region can lead to low levels of transgene expression  <cit> . these position effects are particularly problematic for regulated gene expression systems such as those based on the tetracycline-dependent transactivator   <cit>  and in instances where high levels of transgene expression are required. to be effective such systems need a low level of gene expression in the absence of inducer but high levels in its presence.

position effects can be minimized by bracketing the transgene with insulator elements  <cit> . insulators can both block the unwanted effects of a transcription enhancer and also minimize the effects of heterochromatin. in drosophila the most widely used insulators are the specialized chromatin structures scs and scs'  <cit> , part of the gypsy transposon  <cit>  and the chicken β-globin 5' hs <dig> element  <cit> . these insulators appear to achieve their effects by diverse mechanisms. the chicken β-globin hs <dig> insulator contains multiple elements. the enhancer-blocking element contains a binding site for the ccctc binding factor ctcf  <cit> . the anti-silencer function of chicken β-globin hs <dig> likely recruits histone-modifying enzymes as a high level of histone acetylation and methylation of histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig> are localized at the insulator  <cit> . it is proposed that these histone modifications counteract the spreading of a compact heterochromatic structure. the scs and scs' insulators comprise a set of divergently transcribed promoters  <cit> . they may also function by recruiting histone modifying enzymes. the gypsy insulator may function by establishing loop chromatin domains with the paired insulators at the base of the loop  <cit> .

fluorescent proteins have been widely used to identify transgenic insects  <cit> . apart from dsred, however, the reef coral fluorescent proteins have not been used in insects although they function well as transformation markers in plants  <cit> . here we report the development and evaluation of piggybac vectors containing the scs/scs', gypsy and chicken β-globin hs <dig> insulators, some of which carry reef coral fluorescent proteins as markers.

RESULTS
piggybac vectors containing the scs/scs' insulator elements
to effectively minimize position effects the transgene must be bracketed by insulator elements. in this way the insulators can both block transcription enhancers and heterochromatin spreading. we have constructed four piggybac vectors containing the drosophila scs and scs' insulators . in all of these vectors the insulators flank the marker gene. thus both the transgene and the marker gene should be protected from position effects.

three of the vectors contain reef fluorescent protein marker genes controlled by a promoter that has multiple binding sites for both the pax <dig>  and glass  transcription factors . these marker genes are similar in principle to those developed previously that utilized the 3xp <dig> promoter  <cit> . however, the addition of the gmr sequence would be predicted to increase marker gene expression in the eye  <cit>  and may be more active in some non-drosophilid species. the reef coral fluorescent proteins are available either optimized for translation in human cells or not. codon optimization of gfp led to a significant increase in the level of gfp expression in human cells  <cit> . however, in some important insect pest species such as the medfly ceratitis capitata and the australian sheep blowfly lucilia cuprina the protein coding genes have a very different codon bias than humans  <cit> . since codon bias can significantly affect mrna translation efficiency in insects  <cit> , the vectors carry reef fluorescent protein genes that have not been optimized for expression in human cells. the vectors have a unique not i site between the scs' insulator and the reef fluorescent protein marker gene for insertion of the gene of interest.

the fourth scs/scs' vector we have constructed  has the d. melanogaster cinnabar  eye color marker gene that encodes the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase  <cit> . the cn gene has been used for selection of transgenic ae. aegypti  <cit>  but potentially could be used in other insect species where mutations in the corresponding kynurenine 3-monooxygenase gene have been identified. the vector has a unique pac i site downstream from the cn polyadenylation site that could be used for future gene cloning. although all scs/scs' vectors contain only a single cloning site, both not i and pac i have  <dig> bp recognition sequences and so would be unlikely to cut most gene constructs.

all vectors have been successfully used for germ-line transformation of d. melanogaster. three lines were obtained with the dsred marker, five with amcyan, six with zsgreen and two with the cn gene. lines carrying the gmr-3xp3-reef fluorescent protein marker genes were easily identified as the eyes were brightly fluorescent . this suggests that the gmr-3xp <dig> promoter is a strong driver of gene expression and that the zsgreen and amcyan fluorescent proteins can be used as markers in insects. with the cyan filter set significant levels of zsgreen expression were observed . thus this filter set could not be used to separately observe zsgreen and amcyan expression in the same tissue. the frequency of transformation  was comparable to what we obtained previously with non-insulated piggybac vectors  <cit> .

by visual inspection the fluorescence or color intensity appeared to be similar between lines carrying the same marker gene. a representative fly from each of the five amcyan and six zsgreen lines are shown in figure  <dig>  along with the y w parental strain. the low level of variation in marker gene expression between lines is in contrast to that previously reported for lines carrying the uninsulated 3xp3-egfp, 3xp3-eyfp and 3xp3-ecfp marker genes  <cit> . in a recent experiment six transformed lines were obtained with a piggybac vector containing the uninsulated 3xp3-dsred <dig> marker gene described previously  <cit> . these lines also show considerable line-to-line variation in fluorescence intensity . these observations suggested that the scs/scs' insulators are minimizing position effects.

to confirm these visual observations, more quantitative analyses were performed on the expression levels of the insulated amcyan and zsgreen lines and uninsulated dsred <dig> lines shown in figure  <dig>  two methods were used to estimate fluorescence intensities. firstly, flies heterozygous for a marker gene were selected at random and examined under a stereo fluorescence microscope. images were digitally captured and analyzed using software that can quantify color intensity of a selected region of the image . all amcyan, zsgreen and dsred <dig> lines were more significantly more intense than the control y w parental strain . confirming visual observations, all amcyan and most of the zsgreen lines were not significantly more intense than other lines carrying the same marker gene. the two brightest zsgreen lines  were significantly more intense than the three weakest lines . however, the difference in color intensity between the strongest and weakest lines was less than  <dig>  fold. in contrast, pairwise comparisons of the uninsulated 3xp3-dsred <dig> lines found that the brightest line  was significantly more intense than all other lines as was the second brightest line . further, the brightest line had more than  <dig> times the color intensity of the weakest line.

in the second method, the fluorescence intensities of soluble protein extracts prepared from homogenized heads were measured using a fluorometer . in general the results are in agreement with those obtained with the first method although there was more variability between lines, which was reflected in the statistical analyses. all amcyan and zsgreen lines had significantly higher fluorescence levels than the control strain . in pairwise comparisons the amcyan lines were not significantly different from each other with the exception that the two brightest lines  had significantly more fluorescence than the weakest line . the brightest two zsgreen lines  had significantly higher levels of fluorescence than the other four zsgreen lines. other pairwise comparisons found little significant differences except that the a <dig> and a <dig> lines had significantly higher fluorescence levels than the a <dig> and a8m <dig> lines. while a statistically significant difference was found in some pairwise comparisons it is important to note that at most the fluorescence intensities differ by no more than two fold. while insulators do protect against position effects, it would be expected that the expression levels of insulated transgenes would not be identical between lines  <cit> . in contrast the fluorescence levels of the uninsulated 3xp3-dsred <dig> lines differ by as much as  <dig> fold . in pairwise comparisons, the brighter lines  had significantly more fluorescence than all the other lines carrying the same marker gene.

piggybac vectors containing the gypsy or β-globin hs <dig> insulators
the β-globin 5' hs <dig> insulator sequences were introduced into 3xp3-eyfp and 3xp3-ecfp marked piggybac constructs. the resulting vectors, pbac{3xp3-eyfp>>af>>} and pbac{3xp3-ecfp>>af>>} were used to insulate transgene constructs of the tta/tre binary expression system when introducing conditional embryonic lethality into drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . for completeness, maps of these vectors are shown in figure  <dig>  the transgenic lines carrying the insulated tre-responder constructs seemed to work more reliably and to mediate higher gene expression than their non-insulated counterparts  <cit> , which indicates the functionality of the insulator elements in protecting the embedded transgenes from position effects.

the chicken β-globin 5' hs <dig> insulator sequences are relatively long  and seem to work efficiently. however, the tandem repetition of the element on either side of the insulated region causes problems of recombination when growing these plasmid constructs in bacteria. these constructs can only be grown in recombinase-negative bacteria, like stbl <dig> . to avoid this complication in generating insulated constructs, another smaller insulator from the gypsy element was chosen and introduced into a 3xp3-dsred marked piggybac construct  <cit>  resulting in the transformation vector pbac{3xp3-dsred>af>} . this vector has been successfully used in several germ-line transformation experiments in d. melanogaster. more than thirty lines have been generated at an efficiency comparable to that reported previously for piggybac vectors carrying 3xp3-fluorescent protein marker genes  <cit> .

the gypsy and chicken β-globin 5' hs <dig> vectors contain single asci and fsei endonuclease restriction sites, which allow for a described two step cloning procedure using the shuttle vector pslfa1180fa  <cit> . in contrast to the scs/scs' vectors, the gypsy or chicken β-globin 5' hs <dig> vectors were constructed to insulate only the transgene of interest without insulating the transformation marker gene. in this arrangement, the transgene is also insulated from the cis-regulatory sequences driving marker gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described insulated piggybac vectors carrying different fluorescent protein and eye color markers that have been successfully used for germ-line transformation in d. melanogaster. the use of the reef coral fluorescent proteins amcyan and zsgreen is the first report that these proteins can serve as effective transformation markers in insects. it is likely that all of the insulated vectors will provide some protection against position effects in most insect species. the chicken β-globin hs <dig> insulator is of vertebrate origin yet effectively blocks position effects in d. melanogaster  <cit> . although the gypsy and scs insulators are from d. melanogaster they have both been shown to be effective at protecting against heterochromatin silencing in a cultured human cell line  <cit> . thus the vectors described herein should facilitate fine control of gene expression in a broad range of insect species. also, these insulated vectors may be modified by changing the respective promoter to use them in mammalian systems.
