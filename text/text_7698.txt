BACKGROUND
the contamination of cell cultures by mycoplasmas is a serious problem because these bacteria have multiple effects on cell cultures and also have a significant influence on the results of scientific studies. the mycoplasmas are not harmless bystanders and thus cannot be ignored in the cell cultures.

various elimination methods were previously reported  <cit> . these methods are mainly based on four general procedures, physical, chemical, immunological and chemotherapeutic treatment. the physical procedures include heat treatment and filtration. the chemical procedures, treatments to detergents and other chemicals which are effective only against mycoplasmas, but not against host cells. the immunological procedures include in vitro co-culture with macrophages and specific anti-mycoplasmas antisera and in vivo passage thorough mice. the chemotherapeutic procedures are mainly antibiotics treatments that are kills mycoplasmas.

orientia tsutsugamushi, which is the causative agents of scrub typhus is one of the obligated intracellular bacteria  <cit> . the mycoplasmas-contaminations of o. tsutsugamushi is also very serious in the in vitro studies using cell cultures. furthermore the most effective methods for elimination of mycoplasmas can not be applied for decontamination of o. tsutsugamushi strains because these methods also inhibit the growth of o. tsutsugamushi. decontamination methods should have strong effect on mycoplasmas, but have minimum or no effect on o. tsutsugamushi. only the recommended decontamination method is to passage the contaminated o. tsutsugamushi strains through mice. mouse immunity possibly eliminates only mycoplasmas, although o. tsutsugamushi can survive in its target cells, mainly endothelial cells, splenocytes and hepatocytes. in fact, homogenized spleen of infected mice is generally used for the next inoculation. however, this method sometimes does not work especially for low virulent strains of o. tsutsugamushi because they are generally difficult to propagate in mice.

some of the antibiotics, which are used for elimination of mycoplasmas from tissue culture, are supposed to have less effect against o. tsutsugamushi according to the differences of minimum inhibitory concentrations  of antibiotics between mycoplasmas  <cit>  and o. tsutsugamushi <cit> . in this study, we tried to eliminate mycoplasmas from contaminated o. tsutsugamushi strains by repeating passages through cell cultures with antibiotics in vitro.

RESULTS
according to the mics of antibiotics in the previous reports  <cit> , we used two antibiotics, lincomycin and ciprofloxacin for elimination of mycoplasmas from the contaminated o.tsutsugamushi strains . both lincomycin and ciprofloxacin are effective against mycoplasmas. unfortunately there is no available information about the mics of lincomycin against o. tsutsugamushi. however, according to the mics of lincomycin against gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , lincomycin is supposed to be much less effective against o. tsutsugamushi because o. tsutsugamushi is one of the gram-negative bacteria. for the example, the mics of lincomycin against escherichia coli, one of the typical gram gram-negative bacteria are more than  <dig> times higher than those against mycoplasmas. ciprofloxacin was also less effective against o. tsutsugamushi. the mics of ciprofloxacin against o. tsutsugamushi are about  <dig> to  <dig> times higher than those against mycoplasmas .


mics were obtained from previous reports. a) from  <cit>  and b) from  <cit> .

c) gentamycin was not effective against orinetia tsutsugamushi in a mouse model  <cit> .

our result of the direct sequencing showed that ikeda and kuroki strains of o. tsutsugamushi were contaminated with mycoplasma hominis and m. orale respectively. m. hominis and m. orale are  <dig> to 30% of contaminants of cell cultures   <cit> . previous reports showed that m. fermentas, m. hyorhinis, m. arginini and acholeplasma laidlawii are the most common contaminants as well as m. hominis and m. orale. more than 90% of the contaminants were caused by these six mycoplasmas  <cit> . the taqman pcr and the nested pcr can detect not only all the  <dig> most common contaminants also some other mycoplasmas. these facts suggested that the detection methods were very reliable to monitor mycoplasmas-contaminations in this study.


a) upper  <dig> species of mycoplasmas are the most common contaminants of cell cultures  <cit> .

b) this broad-range taqman pcr can detect many species of mycoplasmas  <cit> .

c) this nested pcr is highly sensitive, and it is used to check for mycoplasma contamination in the cell bank of bioresource centre, riken tsukuba institute, tsukuba, ibaraki, japan  <cit> .

d) pcr assay for sequencing of mycoplasmas designed in this study. partial match means that  <dig> or  <dig> of the total of  <dig> nested-pcr primers match to available regions of the tuf gene on the public database.

for elimination of mycoplasmas, we first cultured a contaminated, high virulent ikeda strain of o. tsutsugamushi using l- <dig> cell in the culture medium containing lincomycin and ciprofloxacin and repeated the passages . lincomycin and ciprofloxacin were used at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml. however, ciprofloxacin at  <dig> μg/ml were cytotoxic against l- <dig> cell in the first assay and was omitted from the further analyses. we checked mycoplasma-contaminations and o. tsutsugamushi-growth at each passage by the two pcr based methods and/or an immunofluorescent  staining . from the passage  <dig> to  <dig> with  <dig> μg/ml of lincomycin, the real-time pcr showed that mycoplasmas decreased, whereas o. tsutsugamushi did not decrease. at the passage  <dig> with the same concentration of lincomycin, the real-time pcr did not detect mycoplasmas, however the nested pcr still detected them. at the passage  <dig>  both the real-time pcr and the nested pcr did not detect mycoplasmas, whereas the flourish growth of o. tsutsugamushi was observed by if staining. we continued to culture with lincomycin until the passage  <dig>  during following passages from  <dig> to  <dig> without lincomycin, mycoplasmas did not recover. these results clearly showed that mycoplasmas were completely eliminated from o. tsutsugamushi-infected cells. however, the cultivation with  <dig> μg/ml of lincomycin as well as  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml of ciprofloxacin decreased both mycoplasmas and o. tsutsugamushi-growths, whereas the cultivation with  <dig> μg/ml of lincomycin did not influence the neither growths.


by the same procedure of ikeda strain, we cultured a contaminated, low virulent kuroki strain of o. tsutsugamushi with lincomycin at  <dig> μg/ml . mycoplasmas and o. tsutsugamushi were monitored by the nested pcr and the if assay respectively . at the passage  <dig>  the nested pcr did not detect mycoplasmas. we then continued to cultivate it with lincomycin until the passage  <dig>  during following passages from  <dig> to  <dig> without lincomycin, mycoplasmas did not recover. these results showed that we successfully eliminated mycoplasmas also from the low virulent kuroki strain. the elimination length of kuroki strain was longer than that of ikeda strain probably because numbers and/or antibiotics-susceptibility of the contaminated mycoplasmas were different. for further elimination of mycoplasmas from other strains of o. tsutsugamushi, we should first evaluate a maximum concentration of lincomycin that does not influence o. tsutsugamushi-growth, and then apply it for decontamination because maximum effects against mycoplasmas are necessary to eliminate them for a short time and to avoid producing lincomycin-resistant mycoplasmas  <cit>  during repeating passages. our additional assay showed that lincomycin at  <dig> μg/ml did not affect the growth , whereas  <dig> μg/ml slightly decreased  the growth in the if assay . many previous reports about antibiotics-susceptibilities of isolated mycoplasmas showed that mics of lyncomycin against m. hominis, m. fermentas and a. laidlawii, which are the major contaminants, were less than  <dig> μg/ml   <cit> . in actual, a previous report showed that lincomycin at  <dig> μg/ml successfully eliminated the other major contaminants of mycoplasmas, m. hyorhinis and m. hominis from cell cultures  <cit> . however, a previous report showed that some isolates of m. hyorhinis were highly resistant to lyncomycin   <cit>  and a few reports showed that other species of mycoplasmas but not major species of contaminants were highly resistant to lyncomycin  <cit> . considering these facts, lincomycin at  <dig> μg/ml can possibly eliminate the contaminants from many of other contaminated strains of o. tsutsugamushi, although it might not be effective for all the cases.


a) a virulent ikeda strain was cultivated using l- <dig> cell in the culture medium containing lyncomycin at the indicated concentrations. the growth was observed by the immunofluorescent staining.

CONCLUSIONS
our results showed an alternative method to eliminate mycoplasmas from the mycoplasma-contaminated strains of o. tsutsugamushi in place of in vivo passage through mice. especially this new method works for the decontamination not only from the high virulent strain also from the low virulent strain of o. tsutsugamushi, which is difficult to propagate in mice. for further elimination, lincomycin at the limit concentration, which does not inhibit the growth of o. tsutsugamushi, can possibly eliminate most mycoplasmas from contaminated o. tsutsugamushi strains.
