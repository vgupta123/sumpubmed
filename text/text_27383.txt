BACKGROUND
salmonella enterica, with over  <dig> different serovars, is indigenous to the gastrointestinal tracts of many mammals, birds, and reptiles, usually in low levels. salmonella can be pathogenic in these animals if it reaches certain numbers in vivo. however, moribund animals are usually culled before they reach slaughter. therefore, the food safety problem relative to humans is that salmonella can be carried into the processing plant in healthy asymptomatic animals. if cross-contamination occurs during the slaughter process, salmonella can then be transferred to carcasses that were previously uncontaminated. a significant increase in the number of salmonella positive broilers between exiting the scalding water immersion tank and exiting the crop extractor demonstrates how in-plant cross-contamination can occur  <cit> . when carcasses were sampled at  <dig> points in processing, an increase occurred in the presence of salmonella from 19% pre-scald to  <dig>  % post-chill .

regardless of whether the source of contamination was pre-harvest or during processing, salmonella is difficult to remove from carcasses due to its ability to adhere to chicken skin and endure the stages of processing  <cit> . laboratory research, as well as in-plant trials, has demonstrated this relationship  <cit> . therefore, persistence of salmonella within the processing plant may be partially explained by interactions between chicken skin and salmonella. chemical treatments have been developed and shown to be effective under controlled conditions in the reduction of salmonella levels on broiler carcasses or skin  <cit> . in spite of these efforts, salmonella is yet to be eliminated from the process.

when testing the efficacy of different antimicrobial compounds, conventional cultural techniques are typically used. the product is sampled, microbiological culturing protocols are followed, and  <dig> to  <dig> hours later the results are known. bioluminescence imaging  is a technique that can be used for real-time quantification and tracking of live bacteria in hosts  <cit> . to enable bli, bacteria are tagged with bacterial luciferase, which catalyzes the oxidation of a long-chain aldehyde and fmnh <dig> to cause emission of visible light  <cit> . salmonella strains constitutively expressing bacterial luciferase have no significant alterations in phenotype, including growth kinetics  <cit>  or biochemical, serological, or structural phenotypes  <cit> . advantages of the bacterial luciferase reporter system include negligible background  <cit> , no toxic or phenotypic effects from accumulation of signal  <cit> , real-time detection, and no need for addition of an exogenous substrate. in addition, bioluminescence from bacterial luciferase correlates well with the amount of luciferase protein and lux mrna  <cit> , bacterial plate counts  <cit> , and intracellular numbers of bacteria in cell culture  <cit> .

in this research, our aim was to develop twelve bioluminescent salmonella enterica strains that can be used for real-time monitoring of the pathogen's growth on food products. our study is unique in that it includes multiple salmonella field strains isolated from the broiler production continuum, including post hatchery, prior to harvest, arrival at the plant, pre-chill tank, and post-chill tank.

RESULTS
bioluminescent salmonella strains
paklux <dig> was transferred to twelve salmonella strains that we isolated in a study on the poultry production and processing continuum. the strains represented the twelve most commonly isolated serovars from our study. this result compared favorably with a previous report where transformation of a lux plasmid into salmonella isolates from a poultry processing plant was only successful for one isolate out of seven attempted  <cit> . expression of the luxcdabe operon, which encodes bacterial luciferase, was driven by the lacz promoter on paklux <dig>  because salmonella does not have laciq in its chromosome, it constitutively expresses the lacz promoter on paklux <dig> and hence produces continuous light while it is alive and metabolically active.

we showed that bacteria numbers and bioluminescence correlated well  in all strains used . the minimum detectable numbers for all twelve strains was less than  <dig> cfu/ml, and it was less than  <dig> cfu/ml for a majority of strains . this result was comparable to previous studies  <cit> .

the average theoretical light intensity per cfu was calculated for each strain and revealed a greater than 10-fold difference between some serovars . this difference was not due to lack of viability; bacterial plate counts showed that all the strains were viable at this stage and that viable bacterial densities for all the serovars were within a  <dig> fold range. the difference in luminescence could reflect a difference between serovars in efficiency of luxcdabe expression from the lacz promoter, or it could reflect a difference between serovars in the activity of bacterial luciferase within the bacteria. alternatively, the difference could reflect differences in metabolic activity between the serovars at this stage of growth . bioluminescence is known to correlate well with bacterial metabolism  <cit> .

plasmid stability
the stability of paklux <dig> was determined by subculturing bioluminescent salmonella broth cultures under selective  and non-selective  conditions for  <dig> days. bioluminescence of salmonella strains cultured under non-selective conditions was declining by day  <dig> and continued declining linearly  until the conclusion of the experiment . based on the data, the average half-life of paklux <dig> in salmonella was approximately  <dig> days under the described culture conditions. however, the stability varied between salmonella serovars. among the salmonella strains, plasmid stability was lower in s. kentucky and s. typhimurium as compared to the others. the half-life of paklux <dig> was about  <dig> days in s. kentucky and about  <dig> days in s. typhimurium . s. newport, s. slachua, and s. enteritidis maintained paklux <dig> longer than others, with a half life of about  <dig> days.

paklux <dig> is derived from the broad host range plasmid pbbr <dig>  which is relatively stable in gram-negative bacteria in the absence of antibiotic selection  <cit> . paklux <dig> was stable in the gram-negative species edwardsiella ictaluri for at least  <dig> days without antibiotic selection, and the plasmid caused no alterations in growth kinetics, native plasmids, and pathogenicity as compared to the parent strain  <cit> . data from the current study indicates that the pbbr <dig> replicon is not as stable in salmonella as it is in other gram-negative bacteria. however, bioluminescent salmonella strains labeled with paklux <dig> should be suitable for short term experiments in which antibiotic selection cannot be applied.

characterization of skin attachment properties of salmonella strains
we developed an in vitro skin attachment model for characterization of attachment properties of different salmonella strains using bli. bioluminescence was successfully detected on chicken skin after being exposed to salmonella strains expressing paklux <dig>  using this model, we were able to show that salmonella strains from different serovars vary in their ability to attach to chicken skin . bacteria numbers in s. seftenberg, s. thompson, and s. schwarzengrund were significantly different from each other and from other strains . the s. heidelberg strain had significantly less binding to chicken skin than all the other strains and was  <dig> fold lower than s. seftenberg, which had the highest amount of binding . this result suggests that salmonella strains vary in their ability to bind to chicken skin; this ability may be a discriminating factor determining whether salmonella strains persist through processing or whether they are removed.

the effect of washing on salmonella removal from chicken skin
bioluminescence was an effective tool for measuring the effects of washing for removal of salmonella from chicken skin using our model . bioluminescent salmonella strains have been previously utilized to monitor progress of infection, effect of heat and ph treatments, growth in food samples, and toxicity  <cit> . one study used a single bioluminescent salmonella hadar isolate to investigate the effectiveness of washing for removal of salmonella from turkey skin  <cit> . the current study demonstrates, for the first time, use of bli for real-time monitoring of twelve salmonella strains using a chicken skin model.

as a general trend observed from all strains, washing suppressed the reproduction of salmonella on chicken skin, probably due to physical removal of bacteria . in non-washed skin samples, salmonella numbers increased steadily over the two hour incubation period , with final numbers showing an increase ranging from 143%  to 459%  compared to initial measurement at time zero. in washed skin samples, the increase in salmonella numbers was lower, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple agitation in water for suppressing salmonella growth on chicken skin.

for all  <dig> strains, the washed treatments had a significantly lower change in bioluminescence than the corresponding non-washed treatments after the  <dig> h wash period. however, there was strain variation in the effectiveness of washing . for three strains , washing reduced the number of salmonella present on chicken skin at  <dig> min compared to  <dig> min . for the other strains, although washing did not decrease the number of salmonella on chicken skin, it was effective in significantly reducing the growth relative to non-washed samples.

when the differences in bioluminescence between washed and non-washed treatments at  <dig> min were compared across strains, the decrease in bioluminescence for s. newport caused by washing was significantly greater than the decrease in bioluminescence for s. alachua, s. braenderup, s. enteritidis, and s. schwarzengrund . thus, based on the difference in bioluminescence between washed and non-washed treatments, washing was apparently most effective in removing s. newport and least effective for s. alachua, s. braenderup, s. enteritidis, and s. schwarzengrund. however, it is interesting to note that the two strains that attached to chicken skin most effectively  were also able to increase their numbers in the wash treatment most effectively  over the  <dig> hr incubation.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that paklux <dig> is effective for labeling salmonella enterica strains with bioluminescence. using this tool, we were able to develop twelve bioluminescent salmonella strains that were isolated from the poultry production/processing continuum. however, stability results indicated that paklux <dig> is not as stable in salmonella as it is in other gram-negative species. therefore, this labeling system may not be useful for long-term experiments, and work is already in progress in our group to develop a labeling system for salmonella that is more stable.

our work also shows that bioluminescence is an effective and sensitive method to monitor salmonella on food products. in particular, our study demonstrates that salmonella strains vary in their ability to attach to chicken skin. future research aimed at determining whether the ability to attach to chicken skin correlates with the ability to persist in poultry production/processing environments is warranted. finally, our results indicate that simple washing in an agitated water bath can remove contaminating salmonella from chicken skin, but this method alone cannot eliminate the salmonella completely due to strong bacterial attachment to skin. therefore, additional methodologies should be used in poultry processing to eliminate salmonella from the chicken skin to prevent disease outbreaks. the skin model developed in this study should be very useful for testing alternative strategies in addition to washing procedures.
