BACKGROUND
the intracellular transport vesicles of eukaryotic cells are responsible for ferrying cellular cargoes between membrane-bound compartments of the secretory and endocytic systems. many of these vesicles are formed by a protein coat which functions both to select and trap cargo and to deform the membrane as part of the budding process. copi-coated vesicles are responsible for the retrograde transport of cargo from the cis-golgi back to the er and have a role in intra-golgi transport . the copi coat consists of seven coatomer subunits which are conserved across eukaryotes  <cit> . with high salt treatment the oligomer dissociates into  <cit> :  the f-copi sub-complex, which resembles the adaptin heterotetramers and is composed of β-, γ-, δ-, and ζcop , and  the b-copi sub-complex, composed of α-, β'-, and εcop  with homology to clathrin  <cit> . the genes encoding each of these proteins are essential for cell survival in yeast, with the exception of sec <dig>   <cit> .

f-copi and adaptin tetramers such as ap <dig> are composed of two large subunits , a medium subunit , and a small subunit . the structure of the ap <dig> holocomplex reveals two large subunits composed of helical trunk domains at the nh2-terminus which form the core of the complex together with the medium and small subunits  <cit> . extending from each trunk via ~ <dig> residue unstructured linkers are the cooh-terminal appendage globular domains  <cit> ; these are predicted to be capable of extending from the core to sample the environment, but to spend most of their time in a retracted position  <cit> . the four subunits of f-copi are predicted to associate in a complex resembling the ap <dig> complex. to date, the only known structure for coatomer is of the γcop appendage, and although the sequence identity between γcop and the large ap <dig> subunits is very low, the structural homology is striking  <cit>  and together with consideration of the overall architecture of the complex, hints at a similar appendage in βcop.

the adaptin-family appendages can be divided into two subdomains, an amino-terminal β-sandwich subdomain with a fold resembling that of immunoglobulins, and a cooh-terminal "platform" subdomain. the platforms of the γcop and ap <dig> appendages each contain an fxxxw motif; in ap <dig> this motif has been demonstrated to mediate binding to a number of ligands important in the regulation of clathrin coat formation . a second ligand binding site is present in the β-sandwich subdomain of both ap <dig> appendages  <cit> . other adaptins and related proteins contain similar appendages with ligand binding functions .

copi vesicle formation is controlled by the small gtpase arf1p which, in turn, is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors  and gtpase activating proteins  . the arfgefs belong to the sec <dig> family of proteins  and catalyze the exchange of gdp for gtp by arf1p, causing the activation and membrane recruitment of arf1p. arfgaps have a complex function that is currently a source of active discussion . the hydrolysis of gtp by arf1p is a prerequisite for vesicle uncoating and requires an arfgap as arf1p has no intrinsic hydrolytic activity  <cit> . arfgaps also play roles in cargo packaging and the detection of membrane curvature, in addition to being a component of the vesicle coat  <cit> . there are six identified proteins containing arfgap domains in yeast: age1p, age2p, gcs1p, glo3p, gts1p, and sps18p. of these, the first four have been demonstrated to have arfgap activity on arf1p  <cit> . there is some redundancy among the yeast arfgaps, with glo3p and gcs1p having overlapping function in retrograde trafficking and forming an essential pair  <cit> .

in this study we sought to examine if βcop contained an adaptin-family appendage and if such a domain would be critical for copi-coated vesicle formation. using a combination of structural modeling, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, we provide supporting evidence that βcop does indeed have an adaptin-family appendage and demonstrate that this domain is essential for βcop function. we also identified the arfgap glo3p as a downstream effector of sec26p. this role of glo3p is not dependent on its catalytic gap activity, suggesting that this protein serves distinct functions in copi vesicle trafficking that are independent from its regulation of the nucleotide bound state of arf1p.

RESULTS
an adaptin-family appendage domain is predicted for sec26p
based on the known similarities in size, sequence, and structure of members of copi to the ap2/clathrin coat, we predicted the sec26p cooh-terminus to contain an adaptin-family like appendage domain  <cit> . to evaluate this possibility, we examined the sequence of sec26p using two protein structure prediction servers, psipred and mgenthreader  <cit> . using psipred, we found that the nh2-terminal  <dig> residues are predicted to be primarily α-helical in nature with some unstructured content . the accuracy rate  of psipred is considered to be approximately 78% per residue  <cit> . from residue  <dig> to  <dig>  the protein is predicted to be composed of β-strands, and from residue  <dig> to the end , there is mixed content predicted. this overall domain architecture is similar to α- and β2ap <dig> which are composed of an nh2-terminal helical trunk domain  <cit> , followed by a ~ <dig> residue flexible linker, then an appendage domain which is composed of a β-sandwich subdomain  and a platform subdomain   <cit> . comparison of the secondary structure prediction for sec26p to the known structures of the large ap <dig> subunits appendage domains suggests that sec26p does indeed possess a similar cooh-terminal domain. specifically, the β-sandwich domain is formed from residues 730– <dig>  and the platform domain from residues 841– <dig>  the boundary in sec26p between the trunk domain and the predicted flexible linker region is not clear based on this prediction, but we expect that the trunk terminates at residue number ~ <dig> as with the ap <dig> subunits. whether there is a flexible linker connecting the two domains or if this region forms a distinct domain in sec26p is unclear from the prediction. the output from the psipred secondary structure server is illustrated graphically in figure  <dig> together with an alignment of equivalent regions of β2ap <dig>  αap <dig> and γcop.

mgenthreader is a protein fold recognition server. input of the entire sec26p sequence returns several "certain" hits, i.e. matches with a confidence level > 99%. included in this list are both the ap <dig> and related ap <dig> cores, specifically the αap <dig>  β2ap <dig>  and γap <dig> chains. input of the sequence for residues 700– <dig>  returns a single "certain"  hit with a net score of  <dig> , namely, the αap <dig> appendage, which has  <dig> % primary sequence identity to the sec26p appendage. the next closest match is the γcop appendage with a "medium" certainty level , with a net score of  <dig>  and a percent identity of  <dig> %. third on the list, with a "guess" certainty level , is the β2ap <dig> appendage with a net score of  <dig>  and a sequence identity of  <dig> %. the sequence relationship of the nh2-terminal trunk domain of sec26p with the other adaptin-family trunk domains, has been previously noted  <cit> . these results emphasize the conservation of fold of the trunk domains and additionally suggest a less stringent but still significant preservation of the adaptin-appendage domain fold.

in addition to structural predictive methods, sequence alignments were also performed to predict the appendage domain in sec26p. alignments between βcops and γcops suggest the appendage of sec26p to begin at approximately residue  <dig>  whereas the alignment with αap2s suggests a start residue of  <dig>  closer to that predicted by the secondary structure predictions. the platform subdomain is predicted to start at residue  <dig> based on the alignments with γcops and at residue  <dig> based on alignments with αap2s, both very close to the start site predicted by the secondary structural prediction models. the appendage domains include several residues which are conserved amongst appendage domains  including the fxxxw motif of the platform domain.

in summary, both secondary structure and fold recognition predictors assign the sec26p cooh-terminus to the adaptin-appendage family with a high level of confidence. the combination of predictive algorithms places the start of the platform subdomain at approximately residue  <dig>  the start of the β-sandwich subdomain is less precisely predicted, somewhere between residue  <dig> and  <dig> in sec26p.

the sec26p appendage, specifically the platform subdomain, is essential in s. cerevisiae
to determine if the predicted sec26p appendage domain was a critical functional unit, a truncated construct of sec <dig>  coding for the trunk region alone was created . this plasmid was transformed into the sec26Δ tester strain and plated on 5-foa for plasmid shuffling. the resultant strain was inviable , demonstrating the essential nature of the sec26p appendage domain. a more conservative truncation  of the predicted platform subdomain also resulted in inviability , demonstrating the critical nature of the function of the platform domain of the βcop appendage. this is in contrast to deletion of the sec21p appendage  region which is non-lethal  <cit> .

over-expression of a truncated sec26p missing the platform subdomain is dominant negative
the lethality caused by removal of the βcop appendage or platform domain could be a result of the appendage/platform domain's critical function; however it was also possible that the truncations render the protein misfolded and subject to degradation, effectively the same as a deletion of the entire gene. since the cell cannot function with sec26Δplat at endogenous levels as the only copy of sec <dig>  we wished to test if this construct could provide function when over-expressed. the truncated gene was placed under control of a copper-inducible promoter  for over-expression . the truncated constructs  were transformed into wild type cells, and screened on solid minimal media containing approximately  <dig>  mm cuso <dig>  as depicted in figure 2c, over-expression of sec26Δplat resulted in inviability on solid media. growth curves in liquid media with varying amounts of cuso <dig>  reveal the dose-dependent nature of the dominant negative effect . over-expression of full length sec26p, the appendage domain  alone, or the platform subdomain  alone, did not result in any detectable phenotype . these results suggest that the appendage domain regulates the activity of sec26p in the context of the holocomplex. the ap <dig> appendages are known to bind both unique and overlapping sets of partners, however, over-expression of the platform or appendage domain of sec26p alone is not detrimental as might be expected if these appendage domains were to associate with binding partners and prevent their action on the holocomplex. this may be due to the fact that these interactions are of low affinity as suggested by the equivalent protein-protein interactions of the adaptin appendage domains  <cit> .

random mutagenesis of sec26p appendage domain reveals residues critical for function
the phenotype difference between sec26p and sec21p appendage domain deletion highlighted the essential nature of this region for copi function. we created point mutations of the sec26p appendage domain to further dissect the action of this domain at a molecular level. initially, targeted mutagenesis was performed on a subset of charged residues chosen based on sequence alignments of fungal species. eight residues were mutated to alanine residues, singly or in pairs as listed: k <dig> and k <dig>  n <dig>  d <dig>  e <dig> and d <dig>  and d <dig> and d <dig>  silent restriction enzyme sites were incorporated to facilitate the identification of correctly mutated constructs. constructs were transformed into the sec26Δ tester strain and plated at  <dig> and 40°c on 5-foa media to assess functionality of the mutant allele. none of the mutations resulted in a detectable phenotype . a random pcr-derived error resulted in the trunk domain mutation sec26- <dig> . this construct was temperature sensitive, whereas other constructs containing the d903a d904a mutations were robustly wild type, suggesting that the phenotype was attributable to the t536a mutation.

we next performed random mutagenesis on the sec26p appendage to generate conditional lethal thermosensitive  mutants. error-prone pcr was performed on the appendage domain of sec26p, leaving the trunk domain wild type. tester strain transformants were screened for functionality after plasmid shuffling on 5-foa plates incubated at  <dig> and 37°c. thirty-eight unique ts mutants were generated from approximately  <dig> transformants  and contain between three and twelve point mutations each; two also contain 13-residue deletions at the cooh-terminus, and one contains an additional five residues at the cooh-terminus due to frameshift mutations. the temperature sensitivity profile of each mutant is shown in table  <dig> and ranged from  <dig> to 40°c. in aggregate  <dig> mutations were identified, which occurred at  <dig> positions out of a total of  <dig> potential positions. notably, five of these randomly generated mutants contained mutations in the fxxxw motif and there was a significant cluster of mutations identified that are close to this motif. many of the mutated residues were represented two and occasionally three times. the number of mutations found occurring at each position is illustrated graphically in figure 3a together with the position conservation and solvent accessibility data for residues that could be mapped onto equivalent positions in the γcop structure.

 <dig> restrictive temperature on scgalactose media

 <dig> also contains additional residues at cooh-terminus 974wttls978

 <dig> also contains deletion of cooh-terminal residues 960–973

because each mutant allele contained an average of  <dig>  individual mutations that could potentially be destabilizing, we wished to determine if the temperature sensitive phenotypes of the mutant alleles of sec <dig> were due to loss of expression at the restrictive temperatures. whole cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using an antibody generated against a recombinant fusion protein of the sec26p appendage domain . the mutant strains were incubated at 40°c for one hour prior to lysis, a time period sufficient to observe a block in secretion measured by the accumulation of intracellular invertase . although some variation in expression is apparent in comparison to the loading control, none of the mutant strains exhibited significantly diminished protein levels or evidence of degradation after shift to the restrictive temperature, compared to wild type cells also incubated at 40°c . these results suggest that the conditional temperature sensitive phenotypes are not the result of instability and altered sec26p levels but are due to functional impairment of the sec26p appendage domain.

the arfgap glo3p genetically interacts with sec26ts mutants
one mutant allele identified through random screening, sec26- <dig> , was found to contain  <dig> mutations restricted to the predicted β-sandwich subdomain , with no mutations in the platform subdomain. because both of the appendages of ap <dig> have been identified to have two binding sites  <cit> , one on the platform and one on the β-sandwich subdomain, and because related appendages without platforms  also bind ligands  <cit> , we selected this mutant to work with further, as a useful complement to the platform subdomain mutant, sec26fw.

to seek candidate downstream effectors for the sec26p appendage, we performed suppressor screens on two of the mutants to identify genetically interacting partners. the sec26fw and sec26- <dig> alleles were integrated into the genome as the sole copy of sec <dig> for use in these screens to facilitate recovery of the suppressor plasmids . these mutant strains were transformed with a galactose-inducible promoter  controlled over-expression library  <cit> , and screened for thermoresistance at the restrictive temperature on galactose-containing media after an overnight recovery period at 30°c. wild type sec <dig> was recovered multiple times, and glo <dig> was recovered twice from the sec26- <dig> screen. suppression by glo <dig> over-expression is partial and does not restore full wild type growth. the pgal1/ <dig> glo <dig> plasmid  was transformed into each of the appendage mutants and found to suppress a subset of them .

since over-expression of glo <dig> suppressed several of the sec26ts mutants, we examined the effect of glo <dig> deletion in combination with the sec26ts mutants. results are shown in figure 4c. most of the sec26ts mutant alleles were synthetically lethal with glo3Δ, and a few exhibited impaired growth. evaluation of the pattern of suppression and synthetic lethality for sec26ts mutants with glo <dig> revealed that one set of mutants were suppressed by glo <dig> over-expression and synthetically lethal with glo3Δ , another two sets showed either suppression or synthetic lethality , and a fourth set did not show either type of genetic interaction . we made use of these groups as additional functional information to identify the residues most significantly contributing to function amongst the  <dig> mutated positions resulting from the random mutagenesis screen. only  <dig> residues were shared by at least three groups . using the structure and homology based alignment of figure  <dig>  we mapped each of these residues onto the γcop appendage domain structure . the equivalents of these residue positions in γcop could be identified as a surface, solvent exposed amino acid on either the "back", "side" or "top" view of the domain, suggestive of a function that engages other proteins necessary to regulate or transduce copi function.

the relationship between sec26p and glo3p
our genetic data clearly demonstrate an interaction between sec26p and glo3p. in order to determine if this was mediated by a direct physical interaction with the appendage, we performed in vitro co-precipitation assays with recombinant proteins. his6-tagged sec26p appendage  was co-expressed with gst-tagged full-length glo3p in e. coli however, we were unable to demonstrate the existence of a direct physical interaction between glo3p and the sec26p appendage in vitro .

since in vitro experiments did not reveal a direct physical interaction between glo3p and the sec26p appendage, we wished to determine if an interaction, direct or indirect, could be demonstrated in vivo. a previous immunofluorescence study in mammalian cells, showed that one of the glo3p mammalian orthologs arfgap <dig>  but not arfgap <dig>  could be disturbed from its golgi localization by over-expression of the mammalian γcop appendage, and that this was dependent on an intact fxxxw motif  <cit> . to determine if glo3p's intracellular localization was influenced by the βcop appendage, we co-expressed glo3p-gfp with over-expressed sec26p appendage under control of pcup <dig>  this was performed in glo3Δgcs1Δ double knockout cells to eliminate any contribution from the functionally overlapping arfgap, gcs1p. we first verified that glo3p tagged with gfp at the cooh-terminus is a fully functional construct by testing its ability to act as the only retrograde arf gap in a double knockout of glo3Δ and gcs1Δ, a genetic background where glo <dig> becomes essential for viability . the appendage of sec21p  was also over-expressed to determine its effect on the localization of glo3p. results are shown in figure 5b. we did not detect any difference in the localization of glo3p-gfp in the presence of either appendage domain when over-expressed. therefore, the localization of yeast glo3p, unlike that of its arf gap ortholog arfgap <dig>  is not dictated by the coatomer appendages and is dependent on additional, as yet unidentified factors and may be functionally be analogous to human arfgap <dig>  <cit> .

an additional function to the arfgap activity of glo3p is suggested by genetic interactions with sec26ts mutants
the gap domain of glo3p is found in the first third of the protein; little is known about the function of the remaining two thirds. each known arfgap, including glo3p, contains a zn-finger motif in the gap domain  <cit>  that is essential for its arf-interaction function. a conserved arginine is also part of this domain and is also required for catalytic activity  <cit> . in order to determine what domain or function of glo <dig> was responsible for the suppression activity , we created truncation and point mutants of glo <dig> under control of the regulatable promoter pgal1/ <dig>  the two glo3p truncation mutants: glo31– <dig> and glo31– <dig> respectively includes the arfgap domain only , and the first two thirds of the protein . we also created a full length construct of glo3p with the catalytic arginine mutated to lysine  under control of pgal1/ <dig> . constructs encoding glo <dig> and glo <dig> mutants were transformed into selected sec26ts strains and plated on galactose-containing media for over-expression. suppression required a full length version of the protein, but did not require catalytic activity . this pattern was observed for each of the three mutants tested . these results suggest that glo3p has a second function that resides in its cooh-terminal domain. the cooh-terminus of glo3p contains two repeats of the amino acid sequence issxxxfg  which are critical for its ability to suppress the growth defect of arf1- <dig>  <cit> . we investigated the potential contribution of these motifs to the ability of glo3p to suppress sec26ts  with a glo <dig> 388aaa <dig> 420aaa <dig> construct. together, results show that the cooh-terminal iss motifs in glo3p are necessary for the ability of glo <dig> to suppress sec26- <dig> and sec26- <dig> mutant cells and that this activity is independent of the ability of glo3p to stimulate gtp hydrolysis on arf.

discussion
the appendage domain of the γcop subunit of the copi vesicle coat bears a striking structural resemblance to adaptin-family appendages despite limited primary sequence homology . the adaptin appendages are integral to the regulation of clathrin-coated vesicles via fxxxw and other motifs. both the γcop appendage domain and equivalent region on βcop contain the fxxxw motif; based on the conservation of this motif in βcop, we predicted the existence of a functional appendage domain in βcop   <cit> . we previously identified the thermosensitive allele sec26fw, which contains mutations of the conserved fxxxw motif  in the platform subdomain  <cit>  although mutation of the same motif in sec21p  had no detectable effect. the  <dig> sec26ts appendage domain alleles identified in this study contained a total of  <dig> mutations distributed amongst  <dig> out of a possible  <dig> positions. given that there were three to twelve point mutations in each allele, the set also probably contains "noise", mutations in residues that do not contribute to the phenotype, in addition to individual point mutations and groups of mutations that together contribute to the overall phenotype. to identify a core set of residues that reliably contributed to the phenotype, we considered the subset of residues that appeared to be frequently mutated and intersected in terms of a genetic interaction with glo <dig>  although this is an arbitrary designation, we used this intersection of phenotypes to provide a stringent filter to select functionally important residues from the experimental set of  <dig> mutated positions. these  <dig> residues could be expected to be involved in either receiving or transmitting βcop functionality given that these residues appeared analogous to surface exposed residues of γcop that might be expected to engage in protein-protein interactions.

this collection of mutants represents the first set of conditional lethal sec <dig> alleles and will be a useful tool for dissecting sec26p function in vivo and vitro as we gain more of a mechanistic and structural understanding of copi function. the identification of a core set of  <dig> residues is undoubtedly a conservative underestimation of the mutated positions in the collection that contribute to sec26p domain functions. with additional functional information about the appendage domain, we expect to be able to refine this analysis further and understand the mechanistic basis by which these residues contribute to appendage domain function.

in addition to shared or overlapping functions of the two appendage domains, the severity of effect in sec26p appendage deletion or mutation suggests that its function contains at least one unique aspect that is more critical to cell physiology than for the equivalent domain in sec21p. similar actions have been proposed for the ap <dig> appendage domains suggesting a common mechanistic theme for these types of coat complexes  <cit> . aside from the fw motif, analysis of the sequence and predicted structural alignments reveal that the residues used by adaptin domains to interact with ligands are chemically different in the case of β- and γcop. these considerations highlight the fact that the ig-like sandwich and the platform subdomain scaffolds provide enormous flexibility in the surfaces they offer for directed protein-protein interactions.

does the predicted βcop appendage have analogous function to the ap <dig> appendages, acting as a hub  <cit>  to recruit protein partners essential to the regulation of copi-coated vesicle formation? the mammalian γcop appendage has been suggested to interact with glo3p, an arfgap  <cit> , and during the preparation of this manuscript, the βcop appendage was demonstrated to interact with the calpain ncl- <dig> in stomach cells  <cit> . interacting partners for the appendage domains may require the multiple low-specificity sites provided by oligomerization of the copi coat on the two-dimensional surface of membranes, and may possibly be governed by regulatory modifications. although we have not identified a direct binding partner for the βcop appendage, and demonstrated that appendage domain over-expression was not dominant negative, our studies did reveal an interesting relationship between the βcop appendage and the retrograde arfgap glo3p. we demonstrate that impairment of sec26p appendage domain function can be suppressed by glo3p over-expression, independent of its catalytic activity, suggesting that the action of glo3p is downstream from copi.

retrograde arfgaps such as glo3p and mammalian arfgap <dig> and arfgap <dig> are known to bind to coatomer as demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo assays and genetically interact with genes encoding coatomer subunits  <cit> , however the specific region of glo3p involved has not been clarified and the number of binding sites on coatomer also remains undefined. mammalian arfgap <dig> has been shown to contain two coatomer binding sites, one in the catalytic domain, and one in the non-catalytic domain  <cit> . additional studies to further explore the nature of the relationship between glo3p, coatomer, membranes and cargo will be necessary to resolve these fundamental questions.

our results do not address where coatomer and arfgaps interact physically in vivo, but do provide interesting insights into the multi-functional nature of glo3p. what is most remarkable about this interaction is that glo3r59k over-expression is able to suppress the sec26ts alleles to virtually the same extent as wild type glo <dig>  cells expressing glo3r59k as the only copy of glo <dig> are inviable and display a variety of secretory defects including failure of vesicle budding, accumulation of er membranes, impairment of cpy processing, and mislocalization of retrograde cargo, however the mutant protein is still able to bind coatomer in coprecipitation assays  <cit> . over-expression of glo3r59k in wild type cells does not impair growth  and one attractive possibility is that glo3p combines gap and effector interactions within the same polypeptide. taken together with our suppression data, this strongly suggests that glo3p has critical functions in addition to its gap activity and that this function involves the cooh-terminus of glo3p operating in conjunction with sec26p and copi. glo3p contains two repeats of the amino acid sequence issxxxfg. this motif is critical for its ability to suppress the growth defect of arf1- <dig>  <cit> , and, as demonstrated in this study, for the ability of glo <dig> to suppress sec26ts mutants. the mechanistic underpinnings of this motif are unclear at present; a search of the yeast proteome reveals the issxxxfg motif in other proteins of very divergent function . further studies are required to decipher how this motif functions and if it could play a more general role. it is interesting to note that this motif is conserved in the human orthologs of glo3p arfgap <dig> and arfgap <dig>  <cit> . outside the gap domain, the homology between arfgap proteins varies, a divergence that reflects the fact that their mechanisms of localization and specific functions are also quite disparate. an important goal will be to establish paradigms to understand how the non-catalytic regions of arfgaps contribute to gap activity and respond to the signal transduction pathways that transmit to, and act downstream of arf proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in these studies we sought to determine if βcop contains an adaptin-family appendage domain similar to that determined for γcop. sequence comparisons and structural prediction tools suggest that the fold of the cooh-terminus of sec26p is strongly predicted to closely mimic that of adaptin-family appendages. experimental approaches, using both deletion and mutagenic studies illustrate the critical role of the predicted sec26p appendage domain and in particular the residues in close proximity to the fxxxw motif that are expected to form a platform-like subdomain. the essential nature of the appendage, the presence of a conserved motif  in the predicted platform subdomain, the weak but significant sequence homology with other appendages, and the predicted secondary structure and fold collectively support the existence of an appendage domain on βcop that plays an important regulatory role in copi function.
