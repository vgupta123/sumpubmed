BACKGROUND
basidiomycete biotrophic pathogens are a major threat to cereal crop production world-wide. many of these fungi are obligate biotrophs and not readily amenable to molecular analysis. in contrast, the corn smut fungus ustilago maydis can be cultured in defined conditions, is amenable to biochemical and genetic analysis as well as molecular manipulation, and its genome has been sequenced and annotated  <cit> . to improve the resources available for using this model, we have created and analyzed deep rna-seq libraries that will enhance genome annotation. in other classes of phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, similar analyses have enabled the detection of previously unidentified transcripts, and increased the accuracy and coverage of transcriptome annotations. several studies in the past 2 years alone have employed high-throughput and massively parallel rna-seq approaches to update current genome annotations of phytopathogenic filamentous fungi including those of botrytis cinerea ; colletotrichum graminicola  and fusarium graminearum . these studies and others have been instrumental in correcting annotation errors, gathering information on untranslated regions  and alternative splice sites, as well as identifying novel protein-coding genes and new isoforms, contributing to our understanding of pathogenicity determinants in phytopathogenic fungi. the deep transcriptome analysis presented here involved u. maydis, u. hordei, and sporisorium reilianum and was carried out with a focus on comparative analyses which expanded the genome annotations and identified conserved natural antisense transcripts.


u. maydis was the first biotrophic plant pathogen to have its genome sequenced  <cit> . this initial sequencing study generated a  <dig>  mb genome sequence containing  <dig> protein-coding gene annotations; but, introns were annotated for only 30% of protein-coding genes, and utr data were not provided. very few previously-characterized pathogenesis genes were identified, however  <dig> secreted proteins were predicted. a function could not be ascribed to  <dig>  of these, and  <dig>  were found exclusively in u. maydis. these secreted proteins included potential effector proteins which stimulated their functional analysis and provided tremendous insight into u. maydis pathogenesis . further information on secreted proteins was obtained by comparative genome analyses  <cit> , however these comparisons also utilized the initial u. maydis genome annotation and did not include information from transcriptome analyses. earlier expressed-sequence tag  library investigations  identified novel protein-coding genes, cell-type-specific gene expression profiles, and alternative splicing. they also improved existing gene structure annotations and determined 5’ and 3’ utr lengths  <cit> . together, these transcriptome-focused analyses substantially improved the initial annotation of protein-coding genes in u. maydis, providing an improved dataset for functional analysis.

in addition to improving our understanding of the protein-coding genome, est analyses revealed non-coding transcription in u. maydis. of the  <dig> predicted gene locations identified by  <dig> ests,  <dig>  aligned to regions of the genome not recognized as coding in the original annotation  <cit> . hundreds of non-coding rnas , including natural antisense transcripts , were identified  <cit> . nats are long ncrnas transcribed from the strand opposite to a protein-coding transcript, thus exhibiting sequence complementarity to mrnas. several fungal nats and other ncrnas are developmentally regulated or expressed in a cell-type-specific manner  <cit> , and functional roles for such transcripts have been elucidated . roles in the regulation of pathogenesis and metabolism were revealed by the characterization of a ncrna and several nats  <cit> . the conservation of these transcripts in the related smut species u. hordei and/or s. reilianum, suggested that conservation of ncrna/nat function was also possible  <cit> .

in the past 3 years, transcriptome-wide ncrna detection in phytopathogenic filamentous fungi has surged with the following findings:  <dig> ncrnas in f. graminearum  <cit> ,  <dig> small rnas in puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici  <cit> ,  <dig> ncrnas in c. graminicola  <cit> ,  <dig> ncrnas in rhizoctonia solani  <cit> , and  <dig> ncrnas in zymoseptoria tritici  <cit> . novel nats have been identified in species including b. cinerea  and u. maydis . in u. maydis, altering the level of ncrnas and nats through promoter deletion reduced virulence  <cit> . together these studies indicate that ncrnas and nats contribute to the control of pathogenic development in fungi but provide no information on whether these functions are conserved or unique in different fungal species.


u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum share common characteristics such as the production of pathogenic dikaryotic filaments as a result of compatible saprophytic haploid cell fusion, proliferation within agronomically important crops, and the production of teliospores as protective dispersal agents  <cit> . the three species differ in that u. maydis infects maize, with localized symptom development  <cit> , whereas u. hordei and s. reilianum systemically infect barley/oats and maize/sorghum, respectively, eliciting symptoms only in their reproductive structures  <cit> . investigations into the molecular basis of these host preference and growth form differences have focused on the identification of distinct effector proteins  <cit> . however, it is unlikely that this is the only form of variation leading to these differences; here we focus on deep transcriptome analysis of the best characterized smut fungus, u. maydis, while augmenting the information obtained through comparative transcriptome analyses. one major difference between these fungi is that u. maydis lacks rnai machinery, while u. hordei and s. reilianum retain this machinery  <cit> . given that dicer can process long ncrnas including nats in filamentous fungi , and that long intergenic ncrnas  and nats are known to regulate u. maydis gene expression and pathogenesis  <cit> , it is possible that some of the roles of these transcripts in the respective fungi are distinct. if this was the case, these distinct functions could differentially influence gene expression among the smut fungi and contribute to host specificity differences. it is also possible that subtle differences in conserved antisense functions could contribute to variation in pathogenic lifestyle. to begin to investigate these possibilities, the lincrnas, including nats in these fungi, must be comprehensively identified.

the existing transcriptome data on u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum were not collected in a manner that focused on which dna strands were represented in the transcriptome, nor was there an effort to identify ncrna expression. the smut fungus transcriptome analyses presented herein utilized massively parallel stranded rna-seq to update current annotations and provide comprehensive identification and characterization of novel u. maydis protein-coding isoforms, lincrnas, nats, and their putative orthologs in the other smuts. the identification of a large number of previously unrecognized transcripts provides a critical knowledge base for a more complete understanding of effectors, and the discovery of a large number of lincrnas and nats that could influence gene expression and pathogenesis in u. maydis as well as the related smut fungi.

RESULTS
rna-seq library creation and rna-seq based transcript characterization
compatible haploid cells from each smut species  were grown separately, or incubated together to form dikaryons or, for u. maydis, co-injected into corn where they fused to form the dikaryon and eventually produced diploid teliospores. rna was isolated from haploids, dikaryons and teliospores for rna-seq library creation . strand-specific rna-seq libraries were generated and deep illumina rna-sequencing yielded > <dig> billion paired-end reads .table  <dig> fungal strains used in this study

paired-end reads were pooled for each fungus and transfrags were predicted using trinity  <cit> . existing munich information centre for protein sequences  gene models were updated to include 5’ and 3’ utrs, alternative splice isoforms, and gene model fusions using the program to assemble spliced alignments . predicted gene models were categorized by cufflinks cuffcompare . the numbers of identified annotation features for each fungus are presented in table  <dig>  detailed genome annotation for each fungus is provided in gff3-formatted .txt files . utr annotations were determined for 87% of u. maydis, 79% of u. hordei, and 88% of s. reilianum genes; and a low number of utrs in each of the three fungi contained introns . average utr lengths  were calculated as 289 bp/304 bp for u. maydis, 235 bp/231 bp for u. hordei, and 211 bp/180 bp for s. reilianum genes.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> alternate splice isoforms were predicted using pasa for u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum genes, respectively . the pasa-predicted isoforms differ from those annotated by cufflinks cuffcompare  because by default, pasa was set to ignore alternate splice isoforms whose coding sequence was altered by >30% in length. in an effort to be consistent with previous mips gene formatting, these pasa-predicted isoforms were designated as “gene name -n”, where n = an alphabetized letter starting with “-b” . further, only  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> merged transcripts were predicted for u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum genes, respectively . finally, cufflinks cuffcompare was utilized to categorize the remaining pasa assemblies. novel transcript identifiers were created by combining the code provided by cufflinks cuffcompare  with the corresponding mips gene identifier. for example, transcript x1-umag_ <dig> and x2-umag_ <dig> represent two unique antisense transcripts to the gene umag_ <dig>  for the unknown intergenic transcripts  >100 nt in length, identifiers were created by combining “u1-” with the pasa assembly identifier . the resulting datasets were used to create updated gff3-formatted genome annotation files for the three smut fungi .table  <dig> rna-seq based predicted gene models

for each rna-seq library, paired-end reads were mapped to their corresponding genome and updated gff <dig> annotation file using clc genomics workbench. fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads  values were calculated by clc genomics workbench for each transcript. maximum fpkm values were determined for each transcript across the rna-seq libraries for u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum. these maximum fpkm values were then used to estimate the number of detected transcripts using a range of fpkm cut-off values . similar to other studies , a conservative threshold of fpkm > <dig> was used as the cut-off to indicate whether a transcript was detected by rna-seq and considered to be expressed by u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum cells from which rna was isolated. if the fpkm value for a given transcript was below  <dig>  the transcript was considered to be predicted but not detected. using these designations, rna-seq-predicted gene models and rna-seq-detected gene models were determined for u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum, respectively . for each smut, alternatively spliced isoforms were detected in addition to those predicted by pasa. overall, this study dramatically increases the number of known transcriptional units for each fungus, as highlighted by the observation that the total number of transcripts detected by rna-seq  in this study were  <dig>  times the number of u. maydis,  <dig>  times the number of u. hordei, and  <dig>  times the number of s. reilianum previously predicted gene models.

detection of non-coding intergenic transcripts and previously uncharacterized orfs
a number of intergenic transcripts  were predicted and detected for each smut. using these nucleotide sequences, the trinotate annotation suite predicted full-length  protein-coding orfs, and translated those orfs into peptides for the purposes of identifying similar peptides in known databases using blastp, and for locating putative secretion signals using signalp . a small number of intergenic transcripts are predicted to encode proteins and some of these contain secretion signals; however, it is striking that  <dig> u. maydis,  <dig> u. hordei, and 1776 s. reilianum transcripts represent novel lincrnas. further, rnammer analysis of the detected intergenic transcripts identified only one new s. reilianum rrna prediction . blastn comparisons identified lincrnas with similar sequences among the different smut fungi, indicating some lincrnas are conserved among the smuts examined in this study .table  <dig> trinotate results summary for intergenic transcripts

antisense transcription is prevalent and conserved among smut fungi
natural antisense transcripts  were detected for  <dig> u. maydis,  <dig> u. hordei, and 1949 s. reilianum genes. the predicted nats are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the detected nats in additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, antisense transcripts were consistently longer in u. hordei , compared to u. maydis , and s. reilianum . further,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> antisense transcripts were detected that contain introns for u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum, respectively . there was also cell-type-specific expression of nats in u. maydis. nats complementary to  <dig> genes were detected in the dormant teliospore and  <dig> of these were not detected in haploids or the dikaryon. similarly, nats complementary to  <dig> genes were detected only in the haploid cells and  <dig> only in the dikaryon. comparison analysis identified antisense transcripts that were conserved in two or all three of the smut fungi . gene ontology  term enrichment analyses on the  <dig> genes with nats in u. maydis revealed enrichment of the molecular function category binding  and go analysis of genes complementary to the  <dig> nats conserved among all three smut fungi revealed enrichment in the molecular function categories: binding , dna binding , nucleoside triphosphatase activity , and its sub-category helicase activity .fig.  <dig> antisense transcript targets conserved in smut fungi. the number of non-redundant genes with antisense are reported with average antisense lengths  for  predicted or  detected antisense transcripts. orthologous loci identities were based on reciprocal best simap hits




validation of rna-seq data
a number of u. maydis transcripts detected by rna-seq were chosen as candidates for expression pattern confirmation tests. transcripts with similar annotation features, such as cell-type-specific expression or the presence of an intron, were categorized and independently assessed by rt-pcr in  <dig> distinct u. maydis cell-types. of the  <dig> candidate transcripts tested,  <dig> were detected in at least one cell-type. an intron was detected in at least one cell-type of each candidate antisense transcript tested with predicted introns . annotation of transcripts from class ‘e’, ‘j’, and ‘o’ suggested the presence of two isoforms. of these transcripts tested , two isoforms were detected, with the exception of the j1-umag_ <dig> and j2-umag_ <dig> loci where only a single major isoform was found. examples of transcript confirmations from each category are shown in fig.  <dig>  candidate transcripts and overall rt-pcr expression results are summarized in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> rt-pcr supports rna-seq-predicted transcripts. rna was isolated from haploid cells , dikaryotic mycelia , dormant teliospores , and u. maydis-infected seedlings at  <dig>  or 14dpi and used as template for rt-pcr. oligo- <dig>  depc-treated water or a strand-specific primer was used to prime the reverse transcription reaction. only the transcript-specific reaction is shown above, along with a genomic dna pcr control  and a no template control . a size marker was also included 




discussion
in this study, we present deep rna-seq and genome annotation updates for three closely related smut fungi: u. maydis, which causes common smut of corn, u. hordei, the causal agent of covered smut of barley, and s. reilianum, which causes head smut of corn. these phytopathogens are threats to cereal crop production worldwide and u. maydis has become the model for biotrophic plant pathogenesis. previous genome annotations for these fungi were based on less comprehensive technologies  and lacked extensive data on important annotation features such as utr length, alternative splicing events and non-coding transcription . our massively parallel stranded rna-sequencing experiments update and expand u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum genome annotations by including data for these features and uncovering conserved nats and lincrnas that can influence gene expression on a genome wide level.

updating protein-coding annotations
the genome annotations currently available in the mips database represent  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> protein-coding genes in u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum, respectively. our analyses permitted us to update thousands of these gene models , which included the identification of: transcript isoforms , pre-mrna fragments , transcripts spanning introns , alternatively spliced isoforms , transcripts overlapping exons , and putative polymerase run-on events . table  <dig> contains a summary of the number of predicted gene models. to confirm our in silico predictions, we screened  <dig> candidate transcripts in these categories by semi-quantitative rt-pcr. we were able to detect 5/ <dig> pre-mrna fragments, 3/ <dig> intronic transcripts, 3/ <dig> novel splice isoforms, 5/ <dig> exon overlapping transcripts, and 11/ <dig> putative polymerase run-on transcripts . the “run-on” transcripts were detected by amplification of an rna fragment that could also represent separate transcripts. given that the average intergenic lengths are 1127 bp for u. maydis,  <dig> for u. hordei, and 929 bp for s. reilianum  <cit> , the putative polymerase run-on transcripts that are < <dig> kbp from a neighbouring gene may actually represent separate transcripts. in addition, we updated utr annotations for 87% of u. maydis, 79% of u. hordei, and 88% of s. reilianum mips gene models, for which 5’ utrs average 289 bp, 235 bp, and 211 bp, and 3’ utrs average 304 bp, 231 bp, and 180 bp, respectively.

the identification of alternative splicing events in all three smuts is noteworthy. previous research identified significant rates of alternative splicing across the genomes of several ascomycetes and basidiomycetes including u. maydis, and suggested that there may be links between alternative splicing and pathogenesis  <cit> . the rates of alternative splicing they reported were higher in pathogenic fungi  than non-pathogenic fungi , although not significantly so. also, the pfam domain descriptions of genes undergoing alternative splicing in pathogenic fungi showed their involvement in fungal adaptation to the altered host environment, suggesting a potential role for alternative splicing in fungal pathogenesis. the numbers reported here, as well as the results from recent rna-sequencing of other fungi could expand and update the data used by  <cit> . for example, illumina-based rna-seq has provided the first evidence of alternative splicing in the pathogen f. graminearum, identifying such events at  <dig> loci  <cit> . in addition, alternative splicing events were identified at 59% of cryptococcus neoformans var. neoformans loci, many of which were altered in response to changes in the environment  <cit> . we have previously detected alternative splicing events at  <dig> % of u. maydis mips genes through est-based analyses  <cit> . using the pasa-predicted transcript isoforms, our current dataset, conservatively expands this number in u. maydis to ~11%, in u. hordei to 9%, and in s. reilianum to 7% . these findings open avenues for future research in identifying the role of alternative splicing in smut pathogenesis and the regulation of gene expression as a whole.

in addition to updating current mips gene models, our sequencing experiments have greatly expanded the annotation depth for each of the smut genomes. relative to the original annotations in the mips database, the number of detected unique transcripts was increased by  <dig>  fold for u. maydis,  <dig> -fold for u. hordei, and  <dig>  fold for s. reilianum . the larger increase for u. maydis was likely due to sequencing rna from haploids, dikaryons, and teliospores  while only rna from haploids was sequenced for u. hordei and only rna from haploids and dikaryons for s. reilianum. increased numbers of detected transcripts were also observed by analyses of deep rna-seq data of f. graminearum yielding a  <dig> -fold increase and that of aspergillus nidulans yielding a  <dig> -fold increase  <cit> . among the novel transcripts detected in our study, a small number have putative orfs. we identified  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> putative novel protein-coding genes in u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum, respectively. of these putative orfs, six u. maydis, three u. hordei, and two s. reilianum peptides contain a putative secretion signal as determined by signalp analyses, suggesting these novel orfs could correspond to effector proteins . in identifying potential effector proteins, it is critical to correctly delineate 5’utrs. the 5’ utr data presented here is consistent with earlier 5’ utr determinations from full-length cdna analyses  <cit> ; however, it is possible that the data set is still not comprehensive. if this was the case then some starts of transcription may have been missed and this would mean that some effector genes may not have been recognized. as such, the additional effector candidate genes presented here must be considered a minimum number. even if this was the case, it would not substantially increase the number of predicted proteins or effectors. other comparable transcriptome studies include updating the genome annotation of a. nidulans, in which 29% of the reads mapped to unannotated loci, and of these ~ <dig>  transcripts,  <dig> were predicted to code functional proteins based on pfam/rfam analyses. this corresponded to a protein-coding gene annotation increase of ~ <dig> %  <cit> . similarly, our expansion of the u. maydis protein-coding annotations corresponds to an increase of  <dig> %, while u. hordei and s. reilianum additions correspond to increases of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . the lower numbers for the latter two smuts are likely due to sequencing fewer libraries relative to u. maydis. with more comprehensive rna-seq for these smuts, the number of updated protein-coding annotations and the number of newly identified transcripts would likely increase further.

expansion of the non-coding transcriptome
although only a small number of the thousands of novel transcripts we detected potentially encode functional proteins, the vast majority do not. these transcripts are, therefore, considered ncrnas. there is increasing evidence that ncrnas are functional and there is support for their influence on the expression of other genes. their functions have been linked to key cellular functions, cancer and even aging  <cit> . the large numbers of ncrnas identified here in the smut fungi fall into two categories: lincrnas and nats.

long intergenic non-coding rnas 
through rna-seq analyses,  <dig> lincrnas ≥100 nt were identified in u. maydis,  <dig> in u. hordei, and  <dig> in s. reilianum . all u. maydis lincrnas that were screened for using rt-pcr were detected , providing confidence in their existence. these lincrna numbers are an order of magnitude higher than those identified by rna-seq studies in other filamentous fungi. large-scale rna-seq analyses detected  <dig> lincrnas in neurospora crassa  <cit> ,  <dig> lincrnas in f. graminearum  <cit> ,  <dig> lincrnas in c. graminicola  <cit> , and  <dig> lincrnas in r. solani  <cit> . although these studies detected wide-spread transcription of lincrnas in filamentous fungi, there has been limited functional analysis conducted. in c. neoformans, the lincrna rze <dig> controls yeast-to-hypha morphological transition by regulating a zinc finger transcription factor znf <dig>  <cit>  and in u. maydis, a lincrna  influences level of virulence  <cit> , though the mechanism by which ncrna <dig> functions is not yet known. taken together, these studies indicate that lincrna transcription is pervasive among the filamentous fungi with the number of lincrnas substantially higher in the smut fungi. a comprehensive detection of possible lincrna orthologs among the smut fungi would require complete genome assemblies to enable accurate positional identification of the lincrnas. this is not currently the case, so our searches were restricted to assessing nucleotide sequence similarity. among the thousands of u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum lincrnas identified here, there was sufficient sequence level conservation to identify  <dig> potential lincrna orthologs present in two or all three of the smut fungi. the identification of lincrna orthologs supports the hypothesis that some of these have functions in the smut fungi.

natural antisense transcripts 
this report is the first to utilize strand-specific rna-seq to investigate transcriptomes of smut fungi. the strand-specificity enabled large-scale detection of nats. antisense transcription was predicted/detected at 50%/38% of the u. maydis loci, 36%/22% of the u. hordei loci, and 45%/29% of the s. reilianum loci . these percentages of protein-coding loci with antisense transcripts are higher than those reported for other filamentous fungi. a recent deep analysis of the a. nidulans transcriptome identified at least one antisense read mapped to 72% of annotated loci, however, this was decreased to 14% when only those transcripts with a rpkm values > <dig> were considered  <cit>  and, in n. crassa, antisense transcripts were present at only ~5% of the annotated protein-coding loci  <cit> . the increased percentage of loci with nats in u. maydis relative to the other smuts likely reflects differences in sequence depth; however, it is noteworthy that u. maydis lacks a functional rnai pathway while u. hordei and s. reilianum have retained the rnai machinery  <cit> . given that fungal nats have been shown to undergo cleavage by dicer , we expected that nats in u. hordei and s. reilianum would be smaller, on average, due to the presence of functional rnai machinery. however, the average length of s. reilianum nats  was comparable to average u. maydis nats , and u. hordei nats were longer on average  . these findings suggested that if the detected nats are functional in these species, they likely exert their functions without involvement of an rnai pathway.

the functional characterization of nats in filamentous fungi has identified roles in development, metabolism, and pathogenesis . in the mushroom-forming basidiomycete coprinopsis cinerea, a large number of antisense transcripts were identified, and a substantial subset of these nats have expression patterns consistent with their having a role in fruiting body development, although clear functional analysis remains to be carried out  <cit> . roles for nats in regulating cellular metabolism stem from studies in n. crassa and u. maydis. in n. crassa, light-sensitive nats regulate the circadian rhythm  <cit> . the core oscillator gene frequency  and a long-non-coding antisense to frq, qrf, regulate each other’s expression through transcriptional interference in a negative feedback loop that involves chromatin modifications and premature transcriptional termination  <cit> . in u. maydis, a teliospore-specific nat  to the mitochondrial seryl-trna synthetase  regulates the stability of ssm <dig> mrna through its direct binding, and also influences growth rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxygen consumption rates  <cit> . these data led to the presentation of a model in which as-ssm <dig> expression in the dormant teliospore  contributes to the suppression of mitochondrial function during dormancy through direct binding of ssm <dig> and  preserves ssm <dig> mrnas for rapid translation upon germination. an indication of a role for nats in regulating pathogenesis comes from investigating the bidirectional regulatory region that controls the expression of teliospore-specific nats to a u. maydis xylitol dehydrogenase  and a d-gluconic acid reductase  gene, as well as ncrna <dig>  <cit> . deletion of this regulatory region altered the expression of the nats and ncrna <dig> and significantly reduced pathogenesis. this indicated that proper control of nat expression is required for full pathogenesis. the details of how the altered regulation impacts pathogenesis are under investigation . it is likely that there are other functional antisense present in the teliospore. rna-seq detected  <dig> teliospore-specific nats,  <dig> haploid cell-specific nats, and  <dig> dikaryon-specific nats. confirming cell-type-specific expression of these nats will identify candidates for future functional investigation.

given the widespread existence of nats in filamentous fungi and their emerging functional relevance  <cit> , it is anticipated that a large number of the nats we have detected in this study are functional. interestingly, ~50% of the u. maydis nats are conserved in either u. hordei , s. reilianum  or both  . in vitro analyses confirmed the presence of 18/ <dig> u. maydis nats that were screened, several of which were predicted to contain introns, overlap known effector proteins or be expressed in a cell-type-specific manner. conservation between species and expression in specific cell-types are characteristics which point to functional relevance  <cit> . the identification of such a high proportion  of genes with conserved nats suggests their potential involvement in something of broad influence within the smut fungi. as an initial functional characterization, we conducted go term enrichment analyses on the nats conserved among the smut fungi. the analyses revealed that the nats conserved among all three smut fungi are complementary to genes that are enriched in the molecular function categories: binding, dna binding, nucleoside triphosphatase activity, and its sub-category helicase activity. this indicates that genes in these categories in the smut fungi have homologous complementary antisense transcripts. if the presence of these nats is independently confirmed in all species, it could indicate a common mechanism of modulating the expression of these genes. since the genes in the dna binding and helicase activity categories alone include histones, transcription factors, chromatin modification enzymes, proteins involved in dna replication including polymerase subunits, as well as dna and rna helicases, this enriched group of genes have the potential to influence gene expression at multiple levels. therefore, if the expression of these genes is modulated by antisense, then antisense could influence multiple levels of gene expression control and through this, practically all aspects of fungal development. further, as stated earlier, these conserved nats must be functioning in an rnai-independent manner. interestingly, the go analysis also provides a basis for a hypothesis regarding how this might occur. our initial hypotheses are that 1) nats influence the expression of genes that can modulate gene expression and 2) this nat influence is modulated through a feedback mechanism involving nat control of protein expression and protein control of nat expression. components of these hypotheses are currently being investigated using nats and helicases preferentially expressed in the teliospore. as such, this rna-seq analysis has substantially advanced the knowledge of a model organism and provided the basis for investigating nat-mediated regulation as a new level of gene expression control in phytopathogenic fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have expanded and updated the genome annotations for three closely related smut fungi, u. maydis, u. hordei, and s. reilianum. we have updated incomplete or incorrect mips gene models, and have added information regarding utr lengths and alternative splicing. hundreds of novel putative protein-coding genes have been identified across the three genomes, a handful of which may represent effector proteins. finally, our analyses enabled the detection of thousands of lincrnas and nats in these smuts, and the determination that a high proportion of the nats are conserved among the three fungi. this provides the basis of hypotheses regarding nat function and a starting point for functional analyses, which may reveal important roles for ncrnas in these species.
