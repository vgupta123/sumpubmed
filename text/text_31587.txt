BACKGROUND
plants have emerged as a safe and economical alternative to mainstream protein expression systems based on the large-scale culture of microbes or animal cells or on transgenic animals to produce biopharmaceuticals. diverse, complex macromolecules such as antibodies  <cit>  and vaccine components  <cit>  have been successfully expressed in plant cells. the possibility to produce biopharmaceuticals using plants offers solutions to some of the problems associated to traditional heterologous expression systems. for example, the bacterial production of biologically active, complex multimeric proteins such as antibodies is limited by the absence of the enzymatic machinery involved in post-translational modification of newly-synthesised proteins  <cit> . among eukaryotic expression systems, yeast is not always appropriate as hyperglycosylation of the final product is often encountered, even if several laboratories are in the process of modulating glycosylation pathways to obtain humanized yeast-derived glycoproteins  <cit> . insect and mammalian cell cultures represent complex expression platforms requiring expensive procedures and may be easily contaminated with toxins, viruses or prions, raising concerns on the safety of the final product. the plant secretory pathway, on the other hand, has been shown to be particularly suitable for the production and accumulation of high amounts of heterologous proteins  <cit> .

modern vaccines are becoming increasingly complex, with several constituted by a combination of multiple antigens. most of the current strategies for vaccination against hiv/aids involve targeting a combination of hiv and host antigens  <cit> . plant-based expression of a number of these candidates has already been achieved, including hiv- <dig> gp <dig> envelope glycoprotein  <cit> , p <dig> core protein  <cit>  and the regulatory tat protein  <cit> .

both regulatory and accessory hiv proteins are currently regarded as promising targets for vaccine development as they could provide further protective efficacy in combination with viral structural proteins. for this purpose, hiv- <dig> accessory nef protein is considered a promising target for vaccine development  <cit> .

nef is incorporated into viral particles and expressed in the early stage of infection both in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane of virus-infected cells. nef interacts with multiple host factors in order to optimise the cellular environment for virus replication  <cit> . its critical role for viral pathogenicity is demonstrated by the fact that the infection with nef-defective hiv strains dramatically decreases the rate of disease progression in seropositive individuals  <cit> . moreover, nef is an important component for ctl-based hiv- <dig> vaccines. for this reason immune responses directed against this viral protein could help to control the initial steps of viral infection and to reduce viral loads and spreading  <cit> .

in vitro proteolysis experiments have shown that nef consists of an n-terminal membrane anchor region and a well folded c-terminal core domain  <cit> . the n-terminal membrane anchor domain structure has been solved in its myristoylated and non-myristoylated forms showing a flexible polypeptide chain with two helical structure elements  <cit> .

when translated in vitro, the nef gene yields two main polypeptides: a full-length n-terminal myristoylated form of  <dig> kda  and a truncated form of  <dig> kda  translated from a second start codon of the nef gene and lacking the first  <dig> amino acids. non-myristoylated p <dig> nef mutant and p <dig> nef were both found in the cytoplasm, while the wild-type, presumably myristoylated p <dig> nef was mainly membrane associated  <cit> . both p <dig> and p <dig> have been expressed in different biological systems. while the levels of p <dig> non-myristoylated expression in e. coli are reasonably high  <cit> , protein yield in yeast and insect cells is very poor  <cit> . in particular, from the analysis of subcellular localization of the recombinant protein in yeast, it appears that the myristoylated form of nef causes cell membranes perturbation  <cit> . moreover, it has been shown that nef expressed in transfected mammalian cell lines can be cytotoxic and cytostatic  <cit> .

to explore the possibility of nef expression in plants, we attempted a number of different strategies. we designed a panel of constructs to direct the expression of nef polypeptides to either the cytosol or the secretory pathway. we tested these constructs initially by transient expression in tobacco protoplasts, to rapidly ascertain the most promising strategy for nef production in stable transgenic plants. plant protoplast transfection is an established in vivo approach that allows rapid assessment of heterologous protein expression in plant cells  <cit> . moreover it allows for an accurate assessment of the intracellular fate of cytosolic or er targeted recombinant proteins  <cit> . here, we report the expression of the p <dig> and p <dig> hiv nef polypeptides and of their non-myristoylated p <dig> variants.

RESULTS
nef is stable in the plant cytosol
we set out to evaluate the ability of plant cells to cope with the synthesis of nef. we generated a number of constructs for nef expression in the plant cytosol or secretory pathway . to facilitate immunodetection of the viral polypeptides, all constructs bore the flag and 6× histidine epitope tags at their c-termini, with the exception of wild-type p <dig> nef that only carried the flag tag. we tested these constructs by transient expression in tobacco mesophyll protoplasts followed by pulse-chase analysis. we initially expressed the cytosolic forms of nef: full length, both with  or without  its n-terminal myristoylation signal, and truncated form . transfected protoplasts were metabolically labelled with 35s-methionine and 35s-cysteine and chased for  <dig> hours. protoplast homogenates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti flag antiserum. sds-page and fluorography revealed that all three constructs are successfully expressed, yielding polypeptides of the expected sizes . note that p <dig> is faster migrating than p <dig> mut as it does not contain the additional histidine tag . all proteins appeared to be stable over the course of the 5-hour chase.

we wanted to investigate whether p <dig> was actually myrystoylated and able to interact with membranes. we therefore transfected protoplasts with plasmids encoding p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> mut. after labelling, protoplasts were homogenised in 12% sucrose and total membranes pelleted. most of the immunoselected nef polypeptides were retrieved in the soluble fraction . as a control for microsomal membrane integrity, the endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone bip  was mainly immunoselected from the membrane fractions . a slightly higher proportion of p <dig> was found in the membrane fraction than p <dig> mut . this indicates that a very small amount of p <dig> may indeed be membrane-associated, possibly via myristoylation. in any case, it appears that the vast majority of plant-made nef is soluble and therefore unlikely to bear lipid modifications.

nef is unstable in the plant secretory pathway
having established that nef is stable when expressed in the cytosol, we tested whether it was possible to express nef in the secretory pathway. therefore we fused the cdnas for both p <dig> and p <dig> to the signal peptide  of the pr <dig> protein  <cit>  . we have previously used this peptide successfully to drive the expression of immunoglobulin chains in tobacco cells  <cit> . we expressed the signal peptide fusions in tobacco protoplasts and subjected cells to  <dig> hours continuous labelling followed by homogenisation, immunoprecipitation with anti-flag antiserum, sds-page and fluorography. figure 4a shows that both sp-p <dig> and sp-p <dig> are expressed and that their mobility is significantly reduced as compared to the cytosolic forms . analysis of the nef polypeptide sequence reveals the presence of two sequons that would be recognised as glycosylation sites upon translocation in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. the presence of these glycans could explain the different electrophoretic mobility of the sp-nef fusions. in order to prevent glycosylation – which of course does not occur during hiv infection – from interfering with the folding of the normally cytosolic, unglycosylated nef protein, we inactivated the glycosylation sites by mutagenesis . we expressed these constructs in tobacco protoplasts and subjected cells to a 1-hour pulse labelling, followed by a 5-hour chase . remarkably, both sp-p <dig> and sp-p <dig> resulted highly unstable, with their levels decreasing sharply during the 5-hour chase period . sp-p25Δgly showed increased mobility, as expected by removal of the glycosylation sites , but also disappeared during the chase. expression of p27Δgly was barely detectable from the outset . none of the sp-nef polypeptides appeared with time in the protoplast incubation medium , indicating that sp-nef fusions are capable of entering the secretory pathway  but are not at all secreted. this phenotype – lack of secretion and fast intracellular degradation – indicates that the nef polypeptides may be subject to strict quality control and subsequently disposed of by the secretory pathway  <cit> . certainly the amount of 'secretory' nef recovered after the chase did not compare favourably with the levels of cytosolically expressed protein. targeting of nef to the plant secretory pathway therefore proved to be a less successful strategy than cytosolic expression. for this reason we employed the cytosolic construct to generate stable transgenic tobacco plants.

stable nef expression in transgenic tobacco and affinity purification
the sequences encoding p <dig> and p <dig> mut hiv- <dig> nef variants were cloned into the binary plant expression vector pbi <dig> and the constructs p <dig> and p <dig> mut  used to generate transgenic tobacco plants. the putative transgenic tobacco plants were analysed by polymerase chain reaction  to verify the nuclear integration of nef gene . seventy p <dig> and  <dig> p <dig> mut lines were analysed, among these  <dig> and  <dig> respectively were positive for nef gene .

we analysed the levels of nef protein expression by direct elisa, using as primary antibody the antiserum to hiv- <dig> nef . in these assays e.coli recombinant nef was used as positive control. fifteen p <dig> mut and  <dig> p <dig> lines were found to express nef variants in detectable amounts. among these,  <dig> lines expressing p <dig> mut  and two lines expressing p <dig>  were further analysed to estimate nef expression levels. we estimated the overall amounts of plant recombinant nef – expressed as percentage of total soluble plant protein  – by using a standard curve generated with different concentrations of e.coli-produced recombinant nef. as shown in fig. 5c, the quantitative elisa revealed variable expression levels of p <dig> and p <dig> mut nef variants in tsp from individual transgenic lines ranging between  <dig> % of tsp  and  <dig> % .

in order to assess the integrity of the plant-expressed nef polypeptides, we collected tissue samples from plants expressing p <dig> or p <dig> mut and subjected them to sds-page alongside increasing concentrations of a flag-tagged anti-lysozyme scfv  <cit>  as a quantitative control . immunoblot with anti flag antiserum revealed an immunoreactive polypeptide of the size predicted for both p <dig> and p <dig> mut and showed clear accumulation of the proteins. in addition, a large amount of faster migrating immunoreactive peptides were also detected. as these are not present in samples from control plants containing empty vector, they are likely to be degradation products of the nef polypeptide.

we took advantage of the 6× histidine tag appended to p <dig> mut to perform a small-scale purification of nef by loading homogenates from transgenic leaf sections on a cobalt affinity purification column. immunoblot with anti flag antiserum  shows that the eluate from this one-step procedure yields an anti flag-immunoreactive polypeptide of the size expected for p <dig> mut. no degradation products are detected, indicating that the purified protein is stable.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have assessed a number of strategies for the expression of hiv nef in planta. we initially used tobacco mesophyll protoplast transfection to test constructs encoding full-length nef, with  or without its myristoylation signal , or truncated nef . the use of protoplast transfection, coupled with metabolic labelling and pulse-chase experiments, allowed us to very rapidly determine what intracellular location was most suitable for expression of nef. our results indicate that cytosolic nef polypeptides are correctly synthesised and relatively stable over a 5-hour time course. the same was not true for nef polypeptides targeted to the secretory pathway by virtue of a signal peptide. although the proteins translocated correctly into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, as demonstrated by efficient n-glycosylation, they were not stable. moreover, there was no evidence for secretion of any of the proteins. even the removal of the glycosylation sites did not significantly improve stability, or promote secretion. although redirection of cytosolic proteins into the lumen of the secretory pathway has often achieved high yield of recombinant protein  <cit>  it is possible that nef, which is normally located in the cytosol or in association with the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane  <cit> , does not fold correctly within the milieu of the endoplasmic reticulum. the fact that no polypeptides are secreted and that degradation seems to occur very rapidly indicate that nef may be disposed of by er quality control mechanisms  <cit> .

our data indicate that cytosolic expression is a more promising strategy. we therefore generated transgenic plants expressing full length or truncated nef. expression levels were variable, but in some lines they averaged  <dig> % of total soluble proteins. this is in line with a number of other heterologous proteins expressed in transgenic tobacco  <cit> . moreover, it is possible that the elisa values represent an underestimate. we have indeed found that plant protein homogenates partially interfere with the detection of recombinant nef in elisa assay: by mixing recombinant e.coli hiv- <dig> nef with control plant protein extracts, we often observed a significant reduction in the elisa reading as compared with the nef protein in buffer alone .

interestingly, cytosolically expressed nef is almost completely non-myristoylated, as indicated by poor membrane partitioning of nef p <dig>  this is somewhat surprising, as the n-terminal myristoylation machinery is conserved in plants  <cit> . in any case, the lack of myristoylation is actually beneficial to the immunogenic properties of nef for the application in a multi-component vaccine  <cit> . indeed, deletion or mutagenesis of the n-terminal myristoylation site has been shown to abrogate the capacity of nef to down-regulate both mhc class i and cd <dig> cell-surface molecules  <cit> , which normally prevents ctl-mediated lysis of hiv-1-primary infected cells  <cit> . therefore the lack of myristoylation is likely to elicit enhanced cellular immune responses.

plant-expressed nef could be purified easily from transgenic leaves using a cobalt affinity column. this indicates that the hexahistidine tag is correctly exposed in the plant-made polypeptides. this ease of purification, together with our data showing that cytosolic nef expression levels in planta are satisfactory, constitutes a useful starting point for further optimisation and scale-up of expression. this will allow us to analyse the biological activity and in vitro/in vivo immunological properties of plant-produced nef proteins.
