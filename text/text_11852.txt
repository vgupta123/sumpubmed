BACKGROUND
oligodendrocytes are specialized cells of the central nervous system that produce myelin, a multilayered membrane spirally ensheathing axons and facilitating rapid nerve conduction  <cit> . the development of oligodendrocytes is a gradual process, in which each step of the differentiation process is characterized by stage specific markers  <cit> . oligodendrocytes originate from oligodendrocyte precursor cells that arise from multiple foci along the neuronal tube and migrate into the future white matter of the brain. after reaching their final position, they develop into mature post-mitotic cells that produce the myelin sheaths  <cit> . during the progression through the oligodendroglial lineage, the cells loose their migratory and proliferative capacities and undergo dramatic changes in their morphology by the formation of a highly branched network of processes. this transformation is accompanied by the expression of a number of gene products that are highly enriched or even specific to oligodendrocytes such as the myelin basic protein , proteolipid proteins , myelin-associated glycoprotein , cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase  and the glycolipids, galactosylceramide and sulfatide. the capacity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells to differentiate into oligodendrocytes that express these different gene products is intrinsic to the lineage and occurs even in the absence of neurons  <cit> . oligodendrocytes need to provide specific sorting and transport mechanisms to enable the synthesis of an extensive amount of myelin membrane in a very short time  <cit> . since oligodendrocytes must produce myelin at the appropriate time of neuronal development, a number of reciprocal signalling systems are likely to operate to coordinate the organisation of axonal domains and the biogenesis of myelin  <cit> . a number of recent studies have shown that neuronal-derived signalling molecules control the development of myelin-forming glial cells  <cit> . we have recently shown that neurons regulate membrane trafficking in oligodendrocytes  <cit> . in the absence of neurons, the major myelin protein, plp, is internalized and stored in late endosomes. after receiving an unknown soluble signal from neurons, oligodendrocytes reduce the rate of endocytosis and increase the retrograde transport of plp from late endosomes to the plasma membrane. a fraction of plp is released in association with exosomes  <cit> . our previous work shows that changes in rho gtpase activity were responsible for switching between these two modes of transport  <cit> . inactivation of rho gtpase activity reduced the transport of cargo to late endosomes and at the same time increased the mobilization of membrane from late endosomes. we found that a neuronal soluble factor was responsible for the downregulation of rhoa gtpase activity in the oligodendroglial cell line, oli-neu  <cit> . the downregulation of rhoa function during morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes is supported by a number of other studies  <cit> . in this study, we were interested in the transcriptional changes that occur after differentiation of oli-neu cells by conditioned neuronal medium or by inactivation of rho gtpase function. this effort led to the identification of the transmembrane protein  <dig>  as a novel marker for oligodendrocytes. the transmembrane protein  <dig> is known as tmem10/tmem <dig> in mice, rats and humans, with the synonyms tmp <dig> or htmp <dig>  recently four tmem <dig> homologs of prosimian species  have been named opalin  <cit> . in this work the human, rat and mouse transmembrane protein  <dig> will be referred to as tmem <dig> 

RESULTS
as a cellular model for oligodendrocyte differentiation we use the oligodendroglial cell line, oli-neu. the advantage of this system is that morphological differentiation of a pure oligodendroglial culture can be triggered synchronously by adding conditioned medium from primary neuronal cultures to the cells. to characterize the gene changes that occur after incubation of oli-neu cells with conditioned neuronal medium, we used affymetrix microarrays. oli-neu cells were incubated for  <dig> hours with conditioned neuronal medium and compared to untreated parallel cultures. cell fractions were used to purify mrna for microarray analysis . using a  <dig>  fold cut-off, we found that  <dig> genes were up-regulated, whereas  <dig> genes were down-regulated by conditioned neuronal medium as compared to the control. the eighty most highly induced genes are shown in table  <dig>  we have previously shown that incubation of oli-neu cells with conditioned neuronal medium leads to rhoa gtpase inactivation. we, therefore, performed gene expression profiling analysis after treating cells with the rho kinase  inhibitor, y <dig> for  <dig> hours and compared the transcriptional changes to the ones obtained after incubation with conditioned neuronal medium. interestingly, 70% of the genes that were controlled by both conditioned neuronal medium and by treatment with y <dig> were regulated into the same direction, indicating that these treatments affected the fate of the cells into a common path . some of these genes such as the udp galactosyltransferase 8a and cnp are known to be upregulated during the progression through the oligodendroglial lineage  <cit> , whereas known housekeeping genes such as the atp synthase served as internal controls and were not differentially expressed after incubation with conditioned neuronal medium or y <dig> . one so far not characterized, but highly upregulated gene is the brain-specifically expressed, tmem <dig>  <cit> . for our further study, we decided to focus on tmem <dig> for a number of reasons. tmem <dig> was the strongest up-regulated gene in our analysis of transcriptional changes induced by conditioned neuronal medium and as well highly up-regulated after treatment with y <dig>  the analysis of the average fold up-regulation in both conditions shows that tmem <dig> is the most up-regulated gene together with cyp2c <dig>  . in addition, a previous microarray analysis identified a  <dig>  fold up-regulation of tmem <dig> during oligodendrocyte differentiation  <cit>  and in situ expression data of tmem <dig> in the allen brain atlas  suggested enrichment in the white matter of the brain.

to begin our characterization of tmem <dig> we raised an antibody against the c-terminal part of the protein and performed immunofluorescence analysis on primary cultures of oligodendrocytes. we did not detect tmem <dig> on ng2-positive oligodendrocyte precursor cells, whereas pre-oligodendrocytes that were still ng2-positive, but also contained o <dig> started to express tmem <dig> . higher expression of tmem <dig> was identified on ng2-negative and o4-positive or o1-positive oligodendrocytes . low levels of tmem <dig> expression can be detected in a2b5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors . colocalization studies of tmem <dig> with mbp indicated that tmem <dig> was present in mature oligodendrocytes where it was enriched in the rims and processes of the cells and was found only to a lesser extent in the membrane sheets . comparisons of tmem <dig> expression in o4-positive/mbp-negative and mbp-positive cells shows that tmem <dig> is redistributed to the rims of the membrane sheets, but the expression level does not change significantly compared to o4-positive oligodendrocytes .

interestingly, double labelling of tmem <dig> with gfap or neuron specific βiii tubulin showed that tmem <dig> could not be detected on gfap-positive astrocytes or neurons, which are present as a minor cell population in the same cultures, indicating a specific expression of tmem <dig> in differentiating oligodendrocytes . additionally, we analysed primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia cultures, but could not detect tmem <dig> on either of these cell types .

the analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of tmem <dig> for protein domains and functional sites with interproscan  <cit>  revealed a predicted signal peptide  and a putative transmembrane domain  . to further characterize the protein structure and the membrane orientation of tmem <dig>  we used n-terminal ecfp- and c-terminal eyfp-fusion proteins of tmem <dig>  oli-neu cells were transfected with either of the fusion proteins and live staining was performed at 4°c with anti-gfp antibody to specifically label the proteins at the cell surface. we found that only the n-terminal ecfp-fusion protein was detectable by surface staining, whereas premeabilization of the cells uncovered both fusion proteins . these results show that tmem <dig>  as predicted from its primary amino acid sequence, is a type i membrane protein.

after ectopic expression of both tmem <dig> fusion proteins and an untagged expression construct, we found that it was mainly localized at the plasma membrane with only very little intracellular staining. tmem <dig> appeared to be enriched in actin-rich membrane ruffles at the cell surface as shown by its colocalization with rhodamine-phalloidin . additionally, comparison of tmem <dig> transfected oli-neu with untransfected control cells shows that our anti-tmem <dig> antibody specifically recognizes tmem <dig> .

to investigate the role of the actin cytoskeleton on the lateral mobility of tmem <dig> we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching  experiments in the presence or absence of the f-actin disrupting drug, latrunculin a. the mobile fraction and the half time of fluorescence recovery did not change after treatment with latrunculin a , indicating that the lateral mobility of tmem <dig> within the plasma membrane is not dependent on a functional cortical actin cytoskeleton. interestingly, we did observe a redistribution of a fraction of plasma membrane tmem <dig> into intracellular sites after treatment with latrunculin a , suggesting a role of the actin cytoskeleton in keeping tmem <dig> at the cell surface.

in summary, we have applied an expression profiling approach to identify genes upregulated during oli-neu cell differentiation. we used two different experimental approaches – incubation with conditioned neuronal medium or treatment with the rho kinase  inhibitor, y- <dig>  this procedure led to the identification of tmem <dig>  a protein that appears during oligodendrocyte differentiation. in cultured oligodendrocytes, tmem <dig> was absent from bipolar precursor cells and started to be expressed after the cells had acquired the o <dig> epitope.

a previous comparative genome analysis suggested that tmem <dig> is a mammalian-specific gene  <cit> . interestingly, the comparison of the genome structure of the tmem <dig> gene and its flanking region identified an evolutionary conserved region within the first intron that functions as an oligodendrocyte-specific enhancer. this domain contains binding sites for myt <dig> and camp-response element binding protein  and the treatment of oli-neu cells with camp enhanced the expression of tmem <dig>  <cit> . previous studies have already shown that camp regulates the expression of several other oligodendroglial-specific genes  <cit> , suggesting a general role for camp dependent signalling in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes into myelin-forming cells. another factor that appears to regulate tmem <dig> gene expression was the leukaemia inhibitory factor   <cit> , which seems to be released by astrocytes in response to atp secreted by neurons and to promote myelination by mature oligodendrocytes  <cit> . together, these data suggest a function for tmem <dig> in an oligodendroglial specific process. our finding that tmem <dig> colocalizes with f-actin in plasma membrane ruffles and in f-actin-rich processes, points to a role in the regulation of the oligodendroglial actin cytoskeleton. this is reminiscent to another oligodendroglial-specific protein, ermin, which has been implicated in the regulation of cell morphology by modulating the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the localization of tmem <dig> to the leading edge of myelin sheets in mature oligodendrocytes suggests a role for tmem <dig> in myelin membrane sheet extension. as tmem <dig> localizes to the growing tip of the myelin sheet it could also be involved in the process of recognition or adhesion to potential axonal targets. further analysis will be required to elucidate these issues.

CONCLUSIONS
during the development of the nervous system oligodendrocytes form a highly branched network of processes and several oligodendroglial-specific genes such as ermin, cnp and tmem <dig> are expressed during this process. gene profiling using microarrays is a useful starting point to identify genes relevant to oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination  <cit> . functional analysis of these proteins, as performed for cnp  <cit> , will be required to elucidate their exact biological function in the generation of myelin-forming processes.
