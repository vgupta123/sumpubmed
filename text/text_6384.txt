BACKGROUND
whole genome duplication is one of the most important evolutionary events in plants  <cit>  and many duplicated genes retained as large blocks have been found in the arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and populus  <cit>  genomes. in arabidopsis, a genome-wide similarities search  was done among protein-coding genes and strong evidence for a whole genome duplication event was demonstrated by phylogenetic analysis. the analysis of the genomic duplication blocks revealed that about  <dig> percent of genes lost their sister genes following wgd  <cit> . in rice, analysis using the structural genomic data and phylogenetic analysis suggested that a polyploidization event occurred about 50~ <dig> million years ago, which was before the divergence of the major cereals but after the divergence of the poales from the liliales and zingiberales  <cit> . analysis of the assembled populus genome sequences revealed evidence for a whole-genome duplication event in the genome, where about  <dig> pairs of homeologs survived after the event  <cit> .

research on the genome data from vertebrates and yeast has shown that factors, such as gene expression intensity  <cit> , protein interaction  <cit> , phylogenetic age  <cit> , and dosage sensitivity  <cit>  have influenced the evolutionary rates or the retention of homeologs after gene duplication. recent research on the unicellular ciliate protozoa, paramecium  <cit> , showed that metabolic genes appear more retained than other types of genes after wgd. in arabidopsis, dosage effects were suggested to be an important factor influencing the retention of homeologs. for example, transcription factors, which have roles in regulating other genes, normally show strong dosage sensitivity and genes encoding transcription factors were over-represented amongst wgd-homeologs as shown by go analysis  <cit> . although plants have evolved the ability to synthesize a vast array of metabolites which are essential for adaptation to diverse natural environments  <cit> , the evolution of plant metabolic networks has not been studied extensively. it is of particular interest to know how plant metabolic networks cope with whole genome duplication events.

graph theory provides paradigms to study networks  <cit> . the plant metabolic network is the well-known biological network  <cit> . its enzymes can be represented by nodes and substrate-product metabolite flux can be represented by directional edges . three topological centralities are used to measure the importance of nodes in the control of information transfer. in-degree refers to the number of links forwarded to the considered nodes, out-degree refers to the number of links outwards from the considered nodes and between-ness measures the propensity of shortest paths from any other nodes going through a certain node. in figure 1b, five enzymes provide products for node α, which produces one product for the next biosynthesis step , so the in-degree of node α is assigned by  <dig> whereas its out-degree by  <dig>  node α and node β are the essential nodes for successful information transfer from the blue nodes to the yellow nodes, if either of them is knocked out, the network would collapse. obviously, in-degree and out-degree only consider the partners connected directly to any particular node, whereas between-ness considers a node's position in the network. usually nodes with relatively higher degrees are termed hubs  and nodes with higher between-ness are named bottlenecks  <cit>  .

in this study, we reconstructed the arabidopsis metabolic network according to the recently updated aracyc data  <cit> . by using graph theory for the analysis of the metabolic network, each enzyme was assigned with topological centralities  to measure quantitatively its importance in the network. the observation that homeologs retained following wgd preferentially encode hub-bottleneck enzymes, provides us a first view of the relationship between metabolic networks and the retention of wgd-homeologs in arabidopsis.

RESULTS
hubs and bottlenecks tend to express highly and evolve conservatively
the arabidopsis enzyme-enzyme metabolic network was constructed using the recently updated aracyc database  <cit>  . we retrieved  <dig> directional interactions among  <dig> enzymes, of which  <dig> enzymes are included in a large network  and the other  <dig> enzymes in  <dig> small clusters. the large connected network contains  <dig> directional interactions and  <dig> bi-directional interactions . in directional interaction, metabolite is the substrate or product of particular enzyme, whereas in bi-directional interaction, metabolite can be used as substrate as well as product by the same enzyme. the large connect network is highly modular and the  <dig> separated modules correspond to functional pathways  , confirming that the topological analysis of enzymes can reasonably reveal their functional status in the network. topologically, the highly modular structure of the arabidopsis metabolic network indicates the existence of bottleneck enzymes, which tend to connect different modules/pathways. between-ness , which refers to the centrality of the considered enzymes in control of substrate-product fluxes in the network, was used to quantify this propensity.

a previous study  <cit>  showed that genes encoding enzymes in the same pathway tend to co-express and core-metabolic pathways display tighter levels of transcriptional coordination, but the relationship between the mrna transcription profiles of genes encoding enzymes and their importance in the metabolic network remains unknown. we did a correlation analysis between the expression parameters  and topological centralities  of enzymes. spearman correlation analysis showed that the in-degree, out-degree and between-ness positively correlate with expression intensity . this indicates that genes encoding the hub and bottleneck enzymes tend to express with higher intensity.

# the q-values were obtained by the fdr correction of p values from spearman correlation analysis, 2-tailed.

we further explored whether genes with higher in-degree, out-degree and between-ness evolve conservatively in orthologous gene pairs between arabidopsis and populus. the non-synonymous substitution rate, ka was used to measure the evolutionary rate of the coding region . by correlating the average ka of genes with their topological centralities, we found that the in/out-degree, out-degree and between-ness negatively correlate with the average ka. also, the in-degree and between-ness negatively correlate with the average substitution rate of the 5' upstream and 3' downstream 1000-bp regions . these results show that the genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes tend to be more conservative in their coding, 5'upstream and 3'downstream regions. taken together, genes encoding hubs and bottleneck enzymes tend to express highly and evolve conservatively.

# the q-values were obtained by the fdr correction of p values from spearman correlation analysis, 2-tailed.

hub and bottleneck enzymes prefer to retain homeologs through wgd
the reconstructed arabidopsis metabolic network enabled us to investigate the relationship between the retention of enzyme-homeologs through wgd and their centralities in the metabolic network. we identified enzymes as wgd-enzymes if these enzymes have at least one pair of homeologs, which were retained through the processes of gene gains and losses following wgd. the dataset of homeologs generated by wgd was retrieved from the arabidopsis polyploidy database http://wolfe.gen.tcd.ie/athal/dup, and genes encoding  <dig> wgd-enzymes were identified . comparisons of in-degree, out-degree and between-ness distributions of wgd-enzymes with those of other enzymes show that the wgd-enzymes have significantly higher in in-degree, out-degree and between-ness scores , indicating that the wgd-enzymes are preferentially located in hub and bottleneck positions of the network. in other words, genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes are preferentially retained as homeologs through wgd.

previous research  <cit>  indicated that more ancient enzymes tend to have higher connectivity. so, we investigated whether the observed enrichment of wgd-enzymes involved as hubs and bottlenecks in arabidopsis metabolic network was due to their phylogenetic ages. of the  <dig> wgd-enzymes in arabidopsis,  <dig> were found to have at least one encoding-genes involved in arabidopsis-populus  or arabidopsis-rice ortholog groups . of the other  <dig> non-wgd enzymes,  <dig> were found to have at least one encoding genes involved in arabidopsis-populus or arabidopsis-rice ortholog groups. chi-square test showed that wgd-enzymes and non-wgd enzymes were not different in phylogenetic age . since the genome duplication event in arabidopsis occurred 20- <dig> million years ago  <cit> , significantly later than the split of arabidopsis and populus  <cit> , the significant differences in connectivity  among the metabolic enzymes must have already existed before the genome duplication event in arabidopsis. the enrichment of wgd-enzymes in the hubs and bottlenecks in the metabolic network were not significantly influenced by the phylogenetic ages.

plant genomes contain significant numbers of tandem duplicate genes. we also tested whether tandem duplicate genes tended to encode hub and bottleneck enzymes. the subset of tandem duplicates genes in arabidopsis was retrieved from the tigr database, http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ath1/tandemdups/tandemgenes.html . of the  <dig> metabolic network enzymes, we identified genes encoding  <dig> metabolic enzymes which retained tandem-homeologs . the comparison showed that the tandem-enzymes and the other enzymes have no significant difference in the in-degree, out-degree and between-ness . so gene families encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes are not preferentially enlarged in their copy number by tandem duplication.

wgd-enzymes tend to catalyze consecutive steps
random simulation was adopted to estimate the impact of preferential retention of wgd homeologs in hubs and bottlenecks. the identified  <dig> wgd-enzymes were used to retrieve the connected wgd-enzymes, and  <dig> interactions  were obtained . simulation analysis involved two steps,  the  <dig> enzymes were randomly assigned in the network,  edges connecting two selected enzymes were marked and the number of edges k was recorded. then steps from  to  were repeated  <dig> times, and resulted in a normal distribution n  of k . the observed number of  <dig> interactions obtained from the wgd-enzymes significantly deviated from random expectation / <dig> =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). this indicated that wgd-enzymes tend to be connected, revealing that they tend to catalyze consecutive steps in the pathways .

the simulation analysis indicated the retention of genes encoding enzyme-homeologs was not independent of the retention of the genes encoding their interacting enzyme-homeologs. for a metabolic interaction e1->e <dig>  after the whole genome duplication, the retention of e <dig> could influenced by the retention of e <dig>  or vice versa. obviously, some interactions promote the simultaneous retention of connected enzymes and could significantly increase the number of ibwe. the number of this type of interactions followed a normal distribution because 255-n = n . to investigate how many wgd-enzymes are due to this type of interaction, we first , removed the information of wgd-enzymes in the network. then a number, m, were drawn from a normal distribution n .  by randomly assigning m edges to the network, nodes connected by the selected edges were marked, and then the number of nodes, f, was recorded. repeating two steps from  to   <dig> times, f followed a normal distribution as n, this indicates that this type of interactions render about  <dig> enzymes to be wgd-enzymes with the standard error of  <dig>  in total, approximately one-third  of the wgd-enzymes were attributable to the impact of metabolic interaction.

we applied comparative genomics to explore whether the interactions connected by wgd enzymes in arabidopsis were also likely connected by wgd enzymes in populus. the datasets of populus enzymes from http://genome.jgi-psf.org/poptr1_1/, and the populus wgd-homeologs were retrieved from http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/ <cit> . our analysis identified populus genes encoding  <dig> enzymes which retain at least one pair of wgd-homeologs . among the  <dig> arabidopsis enzyme-enzyme interactions,  <dig> interactions were identified to be connected by arabidopsis wgd enzymes , while  <dig> ortholog interactions  were found to be connected by wgd-enzymes in populus. of the  <dig> arabidopsis ibwe,  <dig> ortholog interactions also are connected by wgd-enzymes in populus. . the propensity  is significantly higher than the expected value  , indicating that the interactions connected by wgd-enzymes in arabidopsis indeed also tend to be connected by wgd-enzymes in populus.

finally, in the process of wgd, genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzyme can be easily retained their homeologs, providing not only one extra copy of individual enzymes but also another set of interconnected enzymes for the consecutive steps in the pathways.

discussion
the gain/loss of homeologs was an important event in the evolution of the plant genome. previous analysis in arabidopsis  <cit>  showed that some chromosome islands of retention contain 'connected genes' following genome duplication. those genes are mainly from families encoding components of the proteasome/protein modification complexes, signal transduction machinery, ribosomes and transcription factor complexes. our analysis indicated that genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes in the arabidopsis metabolic network tend to be highly expressed and more conserved. this results support the previous observations that highly expressed genes evolve slowly in yeast  <cit>  and genes that have a lower propensity to be lost in the evolution accumulate fewer substitutions in their protein sequences and tend to be essential for the organism viability, tend to be highly expressed, and have many interacted proteins based on the analysis of the vertebrate genomes  <cit> .

our further analysis revealed that genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes in the arabidopsis metabolic network tend to preferentially retain homeologs after wgd and the simultaneous retention of wgd-homeologs encoding enzymes which catalyze consecutive steps in a pathway is highly favored. this phenomena can be best explained by the dosage-sensitive relationship in the gene balance hypothesis which has been demonstrated in yeast and humans  <cit> , maize and drosophila  <cit>  and also by the theoretical prediction  <cit> . in brief, this hypothesis presumes that after long term evolution, "connected genes" of multisubunit complexes in the present genomes have been in an optimum balance status and changes of the individual genes in the subunit would display dosage sensitivity, resulting in out-of-balance phenotypes which have disadvantages in fitness in the evolution  <cit> . in the arabidopsis metabolic network, genes encoding hub enzymes are in the important positions and usually connected with many other enzymes, forming a sub-network, and are very likely to be more sensitive to the dosage effects and indeed preferentially retained after wgd.

the simulation analysis revealed that about one-third of the wgd-enzymes were attributable to the impact of metabolic interaction, the comparative genomics analysis demonstrated that 12% of interactions connected by wgd-enzymes in arabidopsis are connected by wgd-enzymes in populus. the results indicate that genes involving in this type of subnetwork-subnetwork connections tend to form an large evolutionary unit, requiring simultaneous retention of interconnected genes. we assume that the metabolism intermediates between the upstream and downstream enzymes are the key biological driving force. maintaining balanced metabolic flux is important for the survival of plants. recent experimental data  <cit>  demonstrated that over-expression of a gene in the osc-cyp <dig> operon-like gene cluster resulted in the abnormal development of the arabidopsis plant. clear dosage effects were observed in the genetic analysis of saponin biosynthesis pathway in oats  <cit> . sad <dig> encodes  <dig> -oxidosqualene to produce β-amyrin, which eventually is used to produce avenacin a- <dig> by sad <dig> and sad <dig>  double mutant analysis revealed that sad1sad1-sad3sad <dig>  sad1sad1-sad4sad <dig> and sad1sad1-sad3sad <dig> have abnormal root development, while sad1sad1-sad4sad <dig> has the normal root development. in many cases, accumulation of metabolic intermediates would be toxic to plants and simultaneous duplication of consecutive steps in the metabolic pathways is required and favoured.

apart from the potential dosage sensitivity of metabolic interaction, simultaneous expression divergence  of both interacting enzymes-homeologs could also promote the retention of homeologs, in which the coordinated expressional divergence has the strongest effect in achieving the simultaneous retention of enzyme-homeologs. four interacting enzyme pairs showed concerted divergence in transcript expression of developmental stages . that is, in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, the interacting enzymes, ec <dig> . <dig>  and ec <dig> . <dig> , were found to be retained as wgd-paralogs, the retained paralogs of at1g52570-at5g <dig> and at3g15730-at4g <dig> have both coordinately diverged and express in different developmental stages for the benefit of the interaction. the other three divergently connected enzymes showing co-expression are ec <dig> . <dig>  and ec <dig> . <dig> , which were found in the gluconeogenesis pathway, ec <dig> . <dig> and ec <dig> . <dig> , which mediate fatty acid metabolism and the citrate cycle, and ec <dig> . <dig>  and ec <dig> . <dig>  which mediate glutamate metabolism and metabolism of amine groups. the concerted divergence of wgd-enzymes may provide an easy route for the retention of consecutive steps. since only four such interacting enzyme pairs were found, this mechanism seems to make only a small contribution to the retention of enzyme-homeologs.

the gene balance hypothesis also predicts that more "connected" genes are less likely to be retained as a tandem or transposed duplicate and are more likely to be retained postpaleotetraploidy  <cit> . it is indeed that genes encoding the hub and bottleneck enzymes in the arabidopsis metabolic network prefer to retain homeologs through wgd but are not preferentially enlarged in their copy number by tandem duplication.

arabidopsis is a good model for plant polyploidization studies. many economically important plants such as cotton, brassica rapa, potato, soybean, maize and wheat are polyploids. through millennia of hybridization and domestication, wheat cultivars that are diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid have been produced. after the divergence from the ancestral sorghum genome, the tetra-ploidization of the progenitor genomes of maize occurred about 5~ <dig> million years ago  <cit> . polyploidization eventually leads to offspring that are distinguished from its progenitors. analysis of the arabidopsis metabolic network shows that both its robustness has been enhanced by the process of wgd. we predicted that the polyploidizations of these main agricultural plants would have increased their environmental adaptability and provided human-needed traits for domestication. hence, polyploid breeding might be worth more attention in plant breeding programs. also in transgenic-based plant breeding, the simultaneous engineering of a set of hub and bottleneck genes/enzymes would be a better strategy than manipulation of a single gene/enzyme. as more plant genomes are sequenced, a deeper view of the evolutionary impact of wgd can help us to develop better breeding strategies in modern agriculture.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we analyzed the arabidopsis metabolic network by assigning the enzymes with three topological measures, in-degree, out-degree and the between-ness. comprehensive analyses were carried out between the three centralities and the characteristics of the encoded genes, such as expression intensity, evolutionary rate, and retention of homeologs through wgd. our results revealed that genes encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes in the metabolic network are preferentially retained after wgd. furthermore the finding suggested that the retention of metabolic genes was influenced by their interactions and validated that the preferential retention of wgd homeologs encoding hub and bottleneck enzymes is due mainly to the potential dosage effect among interacted genes encoding enzymes if exist). our results could help us get a deeper view of the evolution of plant metabolic network.
