BACKGROUND
sequencing of whole genomes reveals the predominant amount of transposable element dna they contain, as well as how transposable elements have shaped the genome. four plant genomes are now fully sequenced: arabidopsis  <cit> , rice  <cit> , black cottonwood  <cit>  and more recently two grapevine cultivars  <cit> . annotation revealed that the amount of repetitive dna depended on the species, with repetitive dna composing ~10% of the arabidopsis genome , ~35% of rice genome , and ~ <dig> % of the grapevine genome . analysis of repeated dna sequences carried out in these genomes, as well as in larger cereal genomes not yet fully sequenced, has shown that insertion of long terminal repeat  retrotransposons of the two main superfamilies, ty3/gypsy-like and ty1/copia-like are the major components of intergenic regions.

retrotransposons are mobile elements that are closely related to retroviruses in their structure and life cycle  <cit> . active retrotransposons begin the process of transposition when rna is transcribed from the original retrotransposon insertion in the genome. the intermediate rna transcript is reverse-transcribed into dna by a retrotransposon-encoded reverse transcriptase enzyme, and the dna is inserted by additional retrotransposon-encoded enzymes into the host genome at a new location, thus increasing the copy number of the retrotransposon family  <cit> . the generation and reverse-transcription of the rna intermediate is what distinguishes retrotransposons from dna transposons such as the ac/ds elements in maize, which are excised by transposon-encoded enzymes from their original insertion site and moved directly to a new insertion site without an rna intermediate  <cit> . the copy-and-paste cycle of retrotransposition in the host genome requires the synthesis of specific proteins encoded by two major retrotransposon genes, gag and pol. the ty1/copia  <cit>  and the ty3/gypsy  <cit>  superfamilies differ from each other in the order of domains within the pol gene, as well as in their degree of sequence conservation. specifically in ty1/copia elements, the pol gene encodes the protease, integrase, reverse transcriptase , and rnaseh domains in that order from the 5' end of the gene. the enzymatic functions encoded in each of these domains are required to synthesize an extrachromosomal dna daughter copy by reverse-transcription from the intermediate rna prior to its reinsertion into the genome. as the process of reverse transcription is highly error-prone due to the lack of proofreading, the daughter copies can differ from the master copy  <cit> . moreover, individual copies can also diverge independently by mutation following their insertion into the genome. therefore, one hallmark of retroelements is the genetic heterogeneity of individual copies belonging to the same family  <cit> .

despite the heterogeneity within retrotransposon families, effective grouping of elements into phylogenetically-supported clusters of related insertions followed by assessment of the level and timing of divergence within those clusters is necessary for informative analysis. the rt domain has the slowest relative rate of change among all retroelement proteins, while the gag domain has a rate of change more than twice as high  <cit> . because of the extent of sequence conservation within the reverse transcriptase protein, the use of sequence comparisons of reverse transcriptase domains i and vii has been proposed to group retrotransposons into a family when the amino acid identity with other members is ≥90% and into a superfamily when their identity is ≥75%  <cit> . while these are effective criteria for grouping individual insertions into meaningful clusters, better methods exist for determining the age of an individual insertion in the genome. because of the mechanism of transposition, the two ltrs at each end of a retrotransposon are theoretically identical at the time of their insertion  <cit> . after insertion, the 5' and 3' ltrs begin to evolve independently and diverge from each other in sequence. thus, the sequence divergence between the 5' and 3' ltrs of an individual element can be used to estimate the time since insertion at a specific locus  <cit> .

various strategies have been employed to identify retrotransposon sequences in genomes. prior to the determination of the complete genomic sequence of the organism, full-length or parts of ty1/copia-like retrotransposon were identified by virtue of their presence within coding sequence being characterized, such as tnt <dig> in the tobacco nitrate reductase gene  <cit>  or vine- <dig> in a grape adhr gene  <cit> . others insertions have been identified through their contribution to an important phenotypic character such as the color of grape skins associated with the presence of the gret <dig> retrotransposon in the promoter region of vvmyba <dig>  <cit> . following the completion of genomic sequencing of arabidopsis, retroelement sequences have also emerged from computer-based sequence similarity searches in genomic databases  <cit> . few techniques exist to identify explicitly retrotransposon sequences in genomes prior to the characterization of the complete genome sequence for an organism. to address this need, pearce et al. developed a pcr-based method to identify experimentally ty1/copia-like retrotransposon ltr sequences of any higher plant, and verified its utility by isolating novel ltr sequences from pea, broad bean and norway spruce  <cit> . following this procedure, riccioni et al. have isolated tmt <dig>  the first ltr-retrotransposon from ectomycorrhizal fungi of the genus tuber that shows relatedness to ty3/gypsy retrotransposons  <cit> .

because retrotransposons make a significant contribution to the size, organization and genetic diversity of genomes, characterization of grapevine retrotransposons is important. three retrotransposons were described prior to the grape whole-genome sequencing: a unique copy of vine- <dig>  a ty1/copia-like element  <cit>  and of gret <dig>  a ty3/gypsy-like element  <cit>  and the tvv <dig> family  <cit> . the grape genome sequence has recently been obtained from two sources: a highly homozygous grape line pn <dig>  <cit>  and the pinot noir cultivar  <cit> . these genomic resources make possible the characterization in silico of grape retrotransposons. annotation of grapevine transposable elements in the sequence derived from both sources revealed a large prevalence of retrotransposons over transposons. in the pn <dig> sequence, the most abundant transposable elements corresponded to ty1/copia-like retrotransposons, with an uneven distribution over the grape chromosomes, and mainly restricted to low gene density regions and introns  <cit> . in contrast, within the pinot noir genomic sequence the most prevalent retrotransposons corresponded to gypsy/athila-like elements  <cit> . in this study, we extend the utility of the pearce technique into organisms with characterized, complete genomes. we first discovered novel ty1/copia-like families in the grapevine genome through analysis of rnaseh-ltr sequences isolated by the pearce technique from genomic dna derived from pinot noir plant material. we then used the isolated sequences as a highly diverse query set to perform a computer-based sequence similarity search against the completed grape genome sequence dataset. supported by phylogenic analysis, we distinguished novel families and identified a canonic representative element for each family. their phylogenic relationship with other reference plant retrotransposons was studied. based on ltr divergence, insertion dating of full-length copies belonging to  <dig> grapevine retrotransposon families was estimated in order to study the dynamics of these families. finally, the sequence-specific amplification polymorphism  profiles  <cit>  of  <dig> retrotransposon families were evaluated in  <dig> vitis accessions.

RESULTS
characterization of ten new ty1/copia-like retrotransposon families of the grapevine genome
our application of the technique of pearce et al.  <cit>  to the grapevine genome resulted in the isolation of  <dig> putative retrotransposon sequences. among these putative retrotransposon sequences,  <dig> contained an identifiable portion of the 3'-end of ty1/copia-like retrotransposons including a putative rnaseh domain, the polypurine tract , and varying amounts of the 3'ltr sequence. eighteen of them were unique and six almost identical . none of the fragments we identified were similar enough to one of the three grapevine retrotransposon families previously characterized to be considered additional insertions within those previously characterized families.

a data mining procedure from the grape genomic sequence using the blast algorithm with the  <dig> unique and  <dig> of the nearly identical sequences as queries yielded  <dig> different full-length retrotransposons harboring an internal domain flanked by ltrs, twelve of them displaying perfect target duplication sites. thus, the 3'-end sequences of the retrotranpsosons identified by the pearce technique could be used to 'tag' a diverse set of full- or nearly full-length retrotransposons within the completed grape genome. a phylogenic analysis was conducted based on the alignment of the amino acid sequence located between reverse transcriptase domains i and vii deduced from the upstream nucleic sequence of the  <dig> elements. tvv1-vb  <cit> , one of the two ty1/copia-like retrotransposons previously characterized in the grapevine genome were added to improve the comprehensiveness of this analysis. the other, vine  <dig>  could not be included in this analysis, as it lacks the rt-domain sequence that forms the basis for this comparison. the neighbor-joining tree clustered the  <dig> elements into  <dig> distinct families, which were also distinct from tvv1-vb . the largest family, gentil, included eight elements, the edel family three elements and two families, huben and rangen, each included two elements. finally, six families, brand, cremant, gans, kastel, noble and wintz were represented by a single element. the domain order inside the pol gene of the amino acid sequence suggested that all the novel families identified by the pearce technique were ty1/copia-like elements. the clustering data were confirmed by evaluating the identity level of the partial rt domains as suggested by bowen and mcdonald  <cit> . this level was ≥79% within elements classified in the same family, and ranged from 35–67% for elements classified into distinct ty1/copia families. the identity level of the partial domains ranged from 12–21% for comparisons between gret <dig>  a ty3/gypsy element, and the various ty1/copia families.

representation of the  <dig> families in the grapevine genome
the blat program was used to extract the paralogous copies of the ten families from the grapevine genome along with tvv1-vb, vine- <dig> and gret <dig>  a total of  <dig> sequence matches were identified, with the copy number per family ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the families with the highest copy numbers were gentil , edel , noble , and gret <dig>  while huben and kastel  had the lowest copy number . for all families except gret <dig>  copies longer than the reference size were found. in particular, one edel element contains a long insertion that extends its size to over 382% of the reference copy. generally, all families had a median length below that of the reference query, indicating that most of the copies were truncated, but with a high sequence identity to the reference sequence . using vine- <dig> as the query, most of the additional insertions also correspond to truncated copies. one larger copy was  <dig> % of the reference vine- <dig> copy length, but the additional sequence in this insertion does not code for the rt-rnaseh domain that is lacking in the reference vine- <dig> element  <cit> .

considering that all retrieved copies likely were equal in length to their corresponding reference sequences at the time of their insertion, they would represent a total theoretical dna quantity of  <dig>  mb added to the genome by their specific amplification. the gret <dig> family, because of a reference copy size of  <dig>  bp, and noble, due to a combination of large reference copy size and high genomic copy number among the ty1/copia families in the grape genome, would likely have contributed the greatest to the retroelement dna content. summing all actual retroelement insertion lengths, a residual amount of  <dig>  mb of retrotransposon dna  remains in the genome, suggesting that 47% of retrotransposon inserted sequence has been removed between the time of insertion and the present day. copies classified into the  <dig> families are scattered around all chromosomes as currently assembled with an overall density of  <dig>  copies per mb . however, this distribution is not uniform. with  <dig> copies, chromosome  <dig>  has the lowest retrotransposon insertion density  while chromosome  <dig>  has a density almost a third higher . most retrotransposon families seem to be rather uniformly distributed on all chromosomes except gans, which is absent from  <dig> chromosomes but present in  <dig> copies on chromosome  <dig> 

identification of the canonical copies
for each family, a canonical copy was identified among elements whose length was at least 80% of the full-length insertions identified by blat with an identity level higher than 75%. the following additional criteria helped to identify the canonical copy:  perfect  <dig> bp-duplication of target sites,  the highest level of identity between 5' and 3' ltr within a single insertion sequence, and  longest, un-interrupted coding capacity within the gag-pol orf. these criteria are likely to identify the most recently inserted and potentially active member of the family. the criteria differ significantly from the consensus approach that identifies ancestral, presumably active sequences within retroelement families  <cit> . the  <dig> canonical elements selected varied in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  bp, with ltrs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp . for eight of the families, ltrs begin and end with the dinucleotide inverted repeat tg...ca as observed for many ltr-retrotransposons and retroviruses  <cit> . more precisely, seven start with the four-nucleotide stretch tgtt, and among them two, brand and rangen, end with the corresponding inverted stretch aaca. huben and wintz ltrs begin with the four-nucleotide stretch tgtg and end with ttca and gtca, respectively. finally, cremant ltrs begin with the four-nucleotide stretch taac and end with gtca.

one cremant,  <dig> edel and  <dig> noble elements showed a single putative orf uninterrupted by a stop-codon before the ppt, corresponding to polyproteins that were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acids long respectively, indicating that they could be autonomous. by comparison with ty1/copia-like plant retrotransposons previously characterized, the general organization of the putative orfs of cremant, edel and noble elements is very similar both in structure and in length, compared to the  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  amino acid-long orf of the barley bare- <dig> , grapevine tvv1-vb , tobacco tnt <dig> , and arabidopsis thaliana atre <dig>  retrotransposons, respectively. the putative orfs of the seven remaining elements were prematurely interrupted by a stop codon or a frameshift in the coding regions. although gans, gentil, huben and wintz canonic copies lack a putative full-length polyprotein, the homology between ltrs  indicates that they moved recently into their current insertion site . the  <dig> noble copies that are putatively active displayed an orf  <dig>  bp-long but differed by their untranslated leader  region located between the 5'ltr and the orf, which ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp-long. moreover, considering the  <dig> full-length noble copies identified by perfect host  <dig> bp-target sites, their utl region varied from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp , and all started with the sequence tggtatcagagcc which corresponds to the pbs. a detailed analysis of the utl sequence within  <dig> noble elements indicated that variations in size of this region have essentially resulted from large single deletions/insertions.

to elucidate the phylogenic relationships among the ten novel families, tvv <dig>  gret <dig>  and  <dig> other plant ty1/copia-like retrotransposons, the amino acid sequences between motifs i to vii of the rt were aligned  <cit> . in some cases, grape retrotransposon families clustered more closely with previously identified retrotransposon families in other species than with other retrotransposon families in grape .

genomic paleontology
the insertion dates for  <dig> retrotransposon copies considered to be full-length and belonging to the  <dig> families of this study  were estimated by aligning the 5' and 3' ltr sequence according to vitte et al.  <cit> . this analysis  revealed that copy age ranged from ≤ <dig> – <dig> million years . one hundred and fifteen copies  were inserted within the last  <dig> my. forty-five copies belonging to  <dig> families  had identical 5' and 3'-ltrs, indicating recent movement at the limit of detection  for this analysis. two types of insertion age patterns within retroelement families were obtained, reflecting distinct evolutionary histories and activities of particular families. some families had a continuous distribution of insertion dates such as edel  or gentil . in contrast, other families show discrete groups of copies inserted at the same date such as tvv <dig>  or noble  possibly reflecting different bursts of amplification.

insertion pattern of  <dig> retrotransposon families within the genus vitis
to visualize the distribution of copies belonging to  <dig> of the retrotransposon families across the vitis genus, a set of  <dig> vitis accessions including a subset of  <dig> accessions of the v. vinifera species was chosen. for each retrotransposon family, s-sap insertion patterns differed both by the number of scored bands and by the polymorphism level for all accessions . in the vitis set, the  <dig> patterns yielded a total of  <dig> to  <dig> scored bands ranging in size from 125– <dig> bp, depending on the family . this number decreased to 19– <dig> scored bands within the v. vinifera subset. in both sets, the lowest number of scored s-sap bands was obtained for edel and the highest for huben. the percentage of polymorphic bands ranged from  <dig> –100% within the vitis set and from  <dig> – <dig> % within v. vinifera subset. the highest number of bands shared by accessions in both sets corresponded to gans insertions while only one edel insertion was common to the  <dig> v. vinifera accessions.

s-sap data were obtained using forward primers designed from  <dig> retrotransposons in combination with the same eco-ag adapter primer.

discussion
identification of the novel retrotransposon families
combining an rnaseh-ltr analysis of sequences isolated using the technique described by pearce et al.  <cit>  with a computer-based sequence similarity search in the whole-genome grapevine sequence, we have identified ten novel ty1/copia-like retrotransposon families. none of the sequences identified in this study belong to a grapevine retrotransposon family previously described. this result demonstrates effective complementation of bench laboratory and in silico techniques, enhancing the benefits of either used alone. if standard laboratory cloning techniques  were used to obtain complete retrotransposon sequence from the 3'-end sequences isolated by the pearce technique, considerable time and expense would have been devoted to the subsequent procedures and necessary reagents. full-length elements were effectively cloned in silico using the sequences identified by the pearce technique as a query for genomic searches. however, if a purely in silico approach had been employed to isolate new retrotransposon sequence from grape using only previously known retrotransposon sequences from other species as a query, the more divergent elements in grape would have been overlooked. thus, our work expands the utility of the pearce technique from plants with little to no available genomic sequence data available through those plants with fully characterized genomes.

among the  <dig> sequences containing an identifiable portion of the 3'-end of retrotransposons,  <dig> were unique and six almost identical . full-length retrotransposon nucleotide sequence was then identified from the grape genome by querying in blast with the 3'-end of the retrotransposon identified by the pearce technique along with pre-determined total length criteria . clustering of the  <dig> different full-length retrotransposons identified by blast into distinct families was based on the alignment of their corresponding amino acid sequences between reverse transcriptase motifs i to vii  <cit> . ten families were identified, with insertion numbers ranging from an single to  <dig> element insertions. the observed level of identity when comparing amino acid sequences was greater than 79% between elements clustered in the same family, while it decreased from 35–67% between elements classified within differing ty1/copia families, and further drops from 12–21% between any member of the ty1/copia families and gret <dig>  a unique grapevine gypsy element. however, within the corresponding amino acid region, the identity values we obtained are lower than those proposed by bowen and mcdonald  <cit>  for grouping a particular element into a family  and into a superfamily . in our study, amino acid identity values alone did not suggest a clear-cut discrimination point sufficient to classify unknown elements, and a neighbor-joining phylogenetic analysis was more informative.

the ten families we identified were all related to ty1/copia superfamily, as expected from a technique employing primers designed to target ty1/copia rnaseh motifs. however, using the same procedure, tmt <dig>  a tuber ltr-retrotransposon was isolated. its relatedness to ty3/gypsy, retrotransposon superfamily was further established  <cit>  showing that the pearce method is also suitable to isolate gypsy elements. the classification into families of the pcr-amplified fragments revealed an over-representation the two families gentil and edel which were further shown to have the highest copy numbers in the grape genome, whereas six families have been identified from a unique fragment among them noble that showed as many copies as edel. finally seven families start with the four-nucleotide stretch tgtt. thus, the pearce technique may have additional biases for sequence isolation within the ty1/copia group.

genomic fraction of the genome occupied by  <dig> grapevine retrotransposon families
the blat program was used to extract from the pn <dig> genome a total of  <dig> copies paralogous to the  <dig> canonical copies representing the families identified in this study at the most stringent criteria for seeding alignments based on sequences of 95% and greater similarity over  <dig> bases of length or more. blat also detected a small number of perfect sequence matches as short as  <dig> bases that we have taken in consideration. because of the stringent identification parameters we used, the copy number of these families could be underestimated. only copies flanked by perfect  <dig> bp-duplication target sites that result from repair of the integration event were considered, in order to eliminate chimerical copies that could have resulted from errors introduced during genome assemblage. no apparent conservation between  <dig> bp-direct repeats flanking the  <dig> canonical elements were observed, only predominance for a-rich sites.

excluding gret <dig>  a total of  <dig>  ty1/copia-like copies belonging to the  <dig> families cover  <dig> % of the pn <dig> genome. this number can be compared to the  <dig>  occurrences  identified in the pn <dig> genome by blastx annotation or to the  <dig>  occurrences  identified by manual annotation of ty1/copia superfamily  <cit> . the  <dig>  occurrences constitute a total dna amount of  <dig> . <dig> kb, which corresponds to  <dig> % of  <dig> . <dig> kb occupied by the  <dig>  occurrences and to  <dig> % of  <dig> . <dig> kb occupied by the  <dig>  occurrences. gret <dig>  the only ty <dig> gyspy retrotransposon considered in this study covers the largest fraction of the genome, probably due to its length. the  <dig> identified copies covering  <dig> . <dig> kb  of the pn <dig> genome are a part of the  <dig>  occurrences of the total fraction of ty3/gypsy superfamily that cover  <dig> . <dig> kb and of the  <dig>  occurrences covering  <dig> . <dig> kb identified by both annotations. thus, the  <dig> occurrences correspond to  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the total ty3/gypsy superfamily depending on the annotation method. overall, these data indicate that these retrotransposon insertions constitute only a small fraction of the total retrotransposon dna content of the grape genome.

genomic distribution of copies belonging to the ten families is not uniform, with chromosome  <dig> having the highest density and chromosome  <dig> the lowest. however, this result has to be cautiously considered since a large number of copies belong to scaffolds that remain to be attributed to a particular chromosome. retrotransposon density seems to be independent of the density of resistance gene analog  markers since these two chromosomes are very poor in mapped rga loci  <cit> . our results are in general agreement with the uneven distribution of transposable elements over the grape chromosomes, with insertions mainly restricted to low gene density regions  <cit> .

regulation and functionality of the different retrotransposon families
a main feature of the novel families, except brand, is their ltr size ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> bp, shorter that most of the plant retrotransposons previously characterized such as ta <dig>  tnt <dig>  and bare <dig> with ltrs of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  bp, respectively. this common feature of relatively short ltrs could then characterize grapevine ty1/copia retrotransposons. seven families begin with tgtt, a four-nucleotide stretch that also starts many ltr-retrotransposons such as tvv <dig>  vine- <dig>  tst <dig>  tto <dig>  pdr <dig>  ta <dig> or copia. however, neither tvv <dig> nor vine <dig> sequences were captured by this application of the pearce technique in spite of their short ltrs of  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively, and starting with the four-nucleotide stretch tgtt.

in the noble family, copies differ by their utl region sized from 269– <dig> bp. a sequence analysis determined that this size variation is essentially caused by large deletions/insertions within the internal utl region. noble family elements are similar to tvv <dig> elements in the source of their size variation within this region  <cit> .

one to eight copies encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol polyprotein were identified for three families, indicating that these families could be still autonomous and active. for the others, no autonomous copies were identified. our in silico analysis ultimately showed that no full-length copies of vine  <dig>  first described truncated in its 3' orf sequence  <cit>  are present in the grapevine genome . a subset of presumably non-autonomous retrotransposons had identical 5' and 3'-ltrs indicating that they were recently inserted at that locus. it is possible that pn <dig>  an accession bred to near homozygosity, has lost the corresponding active copies during the successive cycles of self-fertilization. however, these functional copies could still remain in the heterozygous parent and in other grapevine accessions as well. it is also possible that trans complementation can occur between autonomous and non-autonomous families, resulting in the movement of retrotransposons that do not themselves code for all of the necessary replication enzymatic machinery.

dating of insertion of the different families
s-sap insertion patterns of  <dig> retrotransposon families on  <dig> vitis accessions showed that these retrotransposon families are present across the vitis genus. only a few insertion sites are fixed in all accessions, which should have been maintained during speciation. most of the scored bands are polymorphic, indicating that these families have been active after speciation across the genus. differences in the number of bands shared in both sets can be interpreted in the light of the differences in activity level between retrotransposon families. the lower polymorphism level of gans could indicate that activity of this family was confined to the distant past, whereas the high polymorphism of edel could indicate more recent activity. to provide more precise insights into the evolutionary histories and activities of different families, time since insertion of full-length copies belonging to  <dig> families was estimated. however, the stringent parameters that we used to retrieve full-length copies has probably eliminated the most degenerated, thus the oldest, copies. in our analysis 71% of the full-length retrotransposon copies were inserted within the last  <dig> my, possibly thanks to a burst of retrotransposition. finally, in a chronology of the insertions of the different families, the older kastel copy being ~ <dig> million years old is in agreement with paleo-botanical data that record the first vitaceae fossils from the miocene   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
combining a molecular genetic approach with a computer-based study, we have identified ten novel grapevine ty1/copia-like retrotransposon families, none of them belonging to a retrotransposon family previously described. our study has increased the number of grapevine retrotrotransposons from  <dig> to  <dig>  studying the characteristics of the different families, we show that at least three families could be still autonomous and active with 1– <dig> copies encoding a single putatively functional gag-pol polyprotein. we have further characterized the representation of each of the  <dig> grapevine retrotransposon families in the genome, including in our study tvv <dig>  vine- <dig> and gret <dig>  vine- <dig> and gret <dig> have both been previously represented by only a single copy characterized in the genome. altogether, we have retrieved  <dig>  copies belonging to the  <dig> families in this study. they currently represent  <dig> % of the sequenced genome, but this corresponds to only half of the amount of retrotransposon dna present at the time of insertion. lastly, we show the presence of  <dig> retrotransposon families across the vitis genus, with s-sap insertion polymorphism indicating their activity after speciation. while the amplification history of the  <dig> families varies both in timing and between families, a majority of copies belonging to  <dig> families were inserted within the last  <dig> my. to our knowledge, this study is the first extensive census of ltr-retrotransposons of the grapevine genome.
