BACKGROUND
despite a bilaterally-symmetrical bodyplan, many animals exhibit a consistent asymmetry in the placement and shape of the heart, viscera, and brain  <cit> . the wide-spread conservation of laterality, and the consistent linkage of the orientation of the left-right  axis with the dorso-ventral and anterior-posterior axes , make lr patterning a fascinating problem  <cit> . in addition to its relevance to basic cell, developmental, and evolutionary biology, laterality presents significant implications for normal physiology and a plethora of clinically-important human syndromes  <cit> . errors in lr patterning include loss of asymmetry , complete inversions , and random placement of individual organs .

it is widely accepted that large-scale lr asymmetry derives from the molecular chirality of subcellular structures  <cit> . however, at least two main classes of models have been proposed for how this chirality is propagated, amplified, and imposed on multicellular fields during development. one popular model focuses on the net unidirectional extracellular fluid flow achieved during gastrulation by the movement of cilia  <cit> .

a different model focuses on much earlier stages, prior to gastrulation, when physiological events leverage asymmetry from the chirality of the intracellular cytoskeleton to set up asymmetrical movement of morphogens through cell fields  <cit> . one such morphogen is serotonin : a neurotransmitter of clinical relevance that has interesting roles outside the central nervous system  <cit> . in two vertebrate species , serotonergic signaling has been shown to be required for lr patterning. in the frog embryo, it is known that 5ht accumulates in the right blastomeres in a rapid process dependent on asymmetric voltage gradients across the midline and the presence of open gap junctions through which it traverses  <cit> .

in xenopus embryos, many aspects of this system have been elucidated: the source of the electrophoretic force driving this 5ht gradient has been molecularly characterized  <cit> , and indeed many aspects are known in enough quantitative detail to allow the whole system to be computationally modeled  <cit> . however, one fundamental question has not been addressed: how does this physiological gradient, occurring in the frog at a time when the zygotic genome is mostly quiescent, couple to the later transcriptional cascade of asymmetrically expressed genes that is known to control organ positioning? specifically: how does the arrival of 5ht within the right-side blastomeres control gene expression? well-known 5ht receptor families  <cit>  are not ideal candidates because they are functional on the outside surface of the plasma membrane, while the 5ht arrives through gap junctions, and thus requires an intracellular binding target.

to better understand how intracellular 5ht signaling is transduced into stable gene expression, from early to very late developmental stages, we hypothesized the involvement of epigenetic machinery as a new component of the lr establishment. such a mechanism is attractive because once epigenetic markers are deposited on the chromatin, they remain stable along successive cell divisions carrying the epigenetic signature of an activated or repressed state of the chromatin. more specifically, we sought to determine whether early manipulation of the epigenetic state of the embryo would affect lr-relevant genes expressed at late developmental stages .

changes in the state of the chromatin have a key role for the proper control of gene expression during development. post-translational modifications such as lysine acetylation constitute a code allowing specific interactions between chromatin and dna binding proteins that ultimately will dictate the status of activation of a gene  <cit> . these modifications take place at the chromatin level and involve the acetylation of lysines in the amino terminal tail of core histones  <cit> .

hdacs are important players for epigenetic memory control as they act by decreasing the levels of acetylated histones leading to chromatin compaction and repression  <cit> . hdacs play a critical role in regulating gene expression and aberrant levels of protein acetylation have been associated with cancer  <cit>  and a range of neurological diseases such as fragile x mental retardation  <cit> . indeed, hdacs blockers can reverse silent heterochromatin to an active conformational structure leading to the normal function of genes that are silent in these pathologies  <cit> . despite their prominent role on gene expression, hdacs can not bind to the dna on their own, but are recruited to specific points on the chromatin via interaction with transcriptional repressive complexes such as those containing mad proteins  <cit> .

vertebrate hdacs can be classified into four groups: class i , class iia  class iib  and class iv . xenopus has a maternal form of hdac  that shows sequence homology to other hdac  <cit> . the hdac activity in early embryos appears to be mainly, if not exclusively, of the hdac-a type, that is of the vertebrate hdac i class  <cit> . although hdac function during xenopus development remains unclear, several studies have demonstrated its importance for vertebrate development. genetic deletion of hdacs in mice and embryonic stem cells results in problems in proliferation  <cit> , while the deletion of hdac <dig> in zebrafish leads to defects in skeletal and neuronal development  <cit> . interestingly, in hdac-null es cells, only 3% of genes are downregulated and about 5% are upregulated. this suggests that the epigenetic machinery is directed to specific points of the chromatin, and indicates that hdacs could underlie regulation of specific developmental signals  <cit> .

here, we probe the involvement of hdacs in lr asymmetry establishment. using several molecular and pharmacological tools, we found that hdac activity is a new component of lr patterning that acts very early in embryonic development . in addition, we identified the hdac-interacting protein mad <dig> as a new component during lr development in the 5ht signaling pathway. our results demonstrate how very early physiological signaling can be transduced into a stable pattern of gene expression at late developmental stages, and sheds light on how epigenetic state and chromatin structure orchestrate important events during early stages of axial patterning in animal development.

scoring for organ situs
at stage  <dig>  embryos were anesthetized with 5% tricaine and analyzed for position  of  <dig> organs: the heart, stomach, and gallbladder  <cit> . heterotaxia was defined as reversal in position of one or more organs. only embryos with normal dorsoanterior development  were scored to avoid scoring instances of secondary randomization due to errors in the dorso-ventral  or antero-posterior  axial patterning  <cit> , and only clear left- or right-sided organs were scored. percent heterotaxia was calculated as the number with heterotaxia divided by the number of total scorable embryos, i.e. embryos normal in all other ways. a χ <dig> test was used for further statistical analysis.

xenopus embryo drug treatment
batches of embryos were separated into experimental and control groups and exposed to  <dig> x mmr  or  <dig> x mmr containing  <dig> mm sodium butyrate   during different stages of development. the drug was washed out and the embryos were allowed to develop until stage  <dig> for nr <dig> in situ or until stage  <dig> for organ placement score.

western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation  assay
for western blottings embryos were collected at stage  <dig>  and homogenized in lysis buffer . the lysate was centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at 4°c and the supernatant was collected and frozen. the extracted proteins were subjected to sds-page and blotted onto a pvdf membrane . after blocking with 5% skim milk and  <dig> % tween  <dig> in pbs, membrane filters were incubated with an anti-mad <dig>  or anti-acetyl h <dig>  overnight at 4°c. the membranes were washed in pbt and incubated with secondary hrp conjugated antibody . immunosignals were visualized with chemoluminiscence.

for co-ip assays, embryos were injected at the  <dig> cell stage with mad3wt-flag or mad3-5mut-flag constructs and collected at stage  <dig>  when  <dig> embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer. a total of  <dig> μl of embryo lysate was incubated with  <dig> μg anti-5ht  or rabbit igg for  <dig> hours at 4°c followed by incubation with proteina-agarose for  <dig> hour at the same temperature. the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed in lysis buffer. the samples were then washed in low salt buffer  and high salt solution . proteins were eluted by adding sds-page sample buffer followed by boiling for  <dig> minutes. for western blotting embryo lysates were loaded on 4-12% gradient polyacrylamide gel  in sample buffer and the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked in 5% non- fat milk in pbt  for  <dig> hour at room temperature and incubated overnight with anti-flag . membranes were washed with pbt and incubated with secondary antibody conjugate to hrp. the blotting was developed with a luminescence kit  and the images were acquired with a camera coupled to a gbox system .

to determine whether nab treatment was effective, whole embryo lysates were prepared from embryos exposed to nab at stages 1- <dig>  stages 7- <dig>  and stages 8- <dig>  including also untreated stage-matched controls. the whole lysate from treated and control groups were prepared in the lysis buffer as described above and boiled for  <dig> minutes. the proteins were separated by sds-page and transferred to nitrocelulose membranes. blots were then incubated with anti-acetyl h <dig>  and developed with chemoluminiscence. to determine the relative abundance of acetylated histone h <dig>  membranes were stripped of antibodies in  <dig> mm glycine buffer ph  <dig>  and re-probed with anti-tubulinα . for quantification of acetylated histone h <dig> protein, the luminosity of individual bands was defined using the histogram function of photoshop and normalized against tubulin. only exposures in the linear phase of detection were used for quantification. sem was defined from normalized acetylated histone h <dig> and measured in three independent experiments. statistical analysis was performed with student's t-test.

chromatin preparation for chromatin immunoprecipitation  experiments
embryos were exposed to  <dig> mm nab from stage  <dig> to  <dig>  when the drug was washed out and the embryos were allowed to develop in  <dig> x mmr until stage  <dig>  the chromatin was then collected and the chip was performed following the protocol  <cit> . the purified chromatin from treated and control groups was then incubated with anti-acetyl h <dig>  anti-acetyl h <dig>  anti-h3k4me <dig>  or anti-rabbit igg  as control. amplification of the precipitated dna was carried out in an applied biosystems step one plus pcr machine, using the standard sybr green program with an initial melt stage at 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec and 60°c for  <dig> min. the run was finished by a melt curve from 95°c to 60°c to ensure that no primer dimer artifacts were formed and that cycle threshold  values represent the desired amplicon. primer sequences were designed with primer  <dig> plus program .

qpcr primers set used: nr <dig> intronic region: forward 5' - ttccctattgacaggggttg - 3'; reverse 5'- gccaaatgtcaaaacactcg -3'. nr <dig> promoter region: forward 5' - tccttgatgaggccattagc - 3': reverse 5' - caaacagagcattccctgac - 3'. the ΔΔct method was used to represent the data as in  <cit>  and each experiment was performed in triplicate and combined for further statistical analysis.

chromatographic 5ht affinity capture screening
one gram of sepharose 4bcl powder was activated according manufacturer's instructions, washed and equilibrated in  <dig> ml buffer  plus  <dig> mm sodium metabisulfite to conjugate of 5-ht to the resin. metabisulfite was added to avoid rapid 5ht oxidation at the alkaline ph necessary for the reaction. the 5ht capture was performed in batch and metabisulfite  <dig> mm was added throughout the whole process. two  <dig> ml aliquots of conjugated resin were centrifuged and then loaded with  <dig> ml of  <dig> cell embryo lysate prepared in lysis buffer  plus  <dig> mm 5ht  or  <dig> ml of  <dig> cell embryo lysate. the mixtures were incubated overnight at  <dig> c, after which the resins were washed three times at room temperature for one hour each with  <dig> mm trishcl ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl at 4c to remove loosely bound proteins. elution was performed in both cases by rotating the resin for one hour at room temperature with the same buffer plus  <dig> mm 5ht. the eluates were concentrated by centrifugational filtration with a cutoff of  <dig> kda. the proteins from each fraction were subjected to a 10% sds-page and, after sample preparation and trypsin in-solution digestion, the peptide mixtures from the eluates were analyzed by lc/ms-ms using a dionex  <dig> lc  coupled to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer . the raw data collected on the ltq was analyzed with sequest software  for protein identification using a database for xenopus laevis.

mad <dig> modeling and simulation methods
the protein sequence of xenopus mad <dig> transcription factor  was obtained from swiss-prot repository . to identify a suitable template for modeling the 3d structure, the sequence was queried against the protein databank  sequences using blast search engine  <cit> . based on the results from these analysis, the crystal structure of lipocalin am <dig>  which is a paralog of monotonin, in complex with 5ht  <cit>  was used as a template to model the non-dna binding region of mad <dig>  using the homology modeling program modeller  with charmm force field parameters. the 3d structure of 5ht was obtained from the co-crystal structure of am <dig>  hydrogen atoms were added and the structure was minimized using amber charges and amber force field as adopted in moe program . in the lipocalin structure, 5ht has salt bridge with asp <dig> and ser <dig>  <cit> . among class-a gpcrs , all biogenic amines including 5ht have a conserved salt bridge interaction with either an aspartic acid or glutamic acid residue in the third transmembrane region that is required for agonist and antagonist activity of gpcr ligands  <cit> . based on this evidence, the proposed site for docking 5ht in mad <dig> structure was identified and consisted of asp <dig>  asp <dig>  asp <dig>  gln <dig>  gln <dig>  5ht was docked to the proposed binding site using the docking software gold   <cit> . twenty independent runs were performed to completely sample the ligand conformation and to avoid local minima and all the docked complexes were scored using goldscore  <cit>  and chemscore  <cit> . the best ranking complex was minimized using moe as described above.

mad <dig> and 5ht in vitro interaction assay
recombinant proteins
for use in binding experiments, mad <dig> protein was obtained as a fusion protein with glutathione-s-transferase  by transgenic expression in escherichia coli and subsequent purification using glutathione -agarose affinity chromatography. briefly, the full mad <dig> coding sequence was amplified by pcr using previously cloned mad <dig> cdna from human cell lines as a template. pcr reactions were performed under standard conditions using pfx dna polymerase . pcr products were cloned into pcr-blunt ii-topo  and subsequently subcloned into pgex-5x- <dig>  using bamhi/sali sites introduced by the pcr primers. all constructs were confirmed by sequencing. to express gst-mad <dig>  transformed e. coli bl <dig> were grown overnight at 37°c, diluted 200-fold in fresh medium and grown at room temperature until od <dig> =  <dig> - <dig> . the culture was induced with  <dig>  mm iptg for  <dig> hours at room temperature. to express gst, e. coli bl <dig> were transformed with the empty vector, grown at 37°c to od <dig> =  <dig> - <dig>  and induced with  <dig> mm iptg for  <dig> hour at 37°c. after induction, pelleted cells  were resuspended in  <dig> ml bugbuster protein extraction reagent  per gram of wet cell paste and lysed with  <dig> μg/ml each lysozyme and dnase i for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. lysates were cleared by centrifugation for  <dig> minutes at  <dig>  g and the supernatants were applied directly to a gsh-agarose column. proteins were purified using standard procedures. bound proteins were eluted with  <dig> mm gsh/ <dig> mm tris ph  <dig>  the eluates were concentrated and the buffer changed to hbs-ep  using an amicon ultra- <dig> device. typically, gst was expressed in large quantities in the soluble fraction, while gst-mad <dig> was found mostly in inclusion bodies, with a small percentage in the soluble fraction from which it was purified. protein concentration was determined by the bca method and the purity of the fractions was confirmed by sds-page.

surface plasmon resonance
binding experiments were carried out on a biacore x system . proteins of interest were immobilized on a cm <dig> chip using the amine coupling kit . specifically, two cells on a cm <dig> chip were activated using a 1: <dig> ratio of n-hydroxysuccinimide :1-ethyl-3- carbodiimide  at a flow rate of  <dig> μl/min for  <dig> min. recombinant gst and gst-mad <dig> proteins were prepared as described above at a final concentration of  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml respectively in hbs-ep buffer . prior to injection,  <dig> μl of protein solution were mixed with  <dig> μl of  <dig> mm glycine ph  <dig> , since these were the optimum conditions for capture as determined by pre-concentration experiments. gst was immobilized in the reference cell fc <dig> by one  <dig> μl-injection at  <dig> μl/min. gst-mad <dig> was immobilized in the sample cell fc <dig> by five  <dig> μl-injections at  <dig> μl/min. both fc <dig> and fc <dig> were subsequently blocked with  <dig> m ethanolamine  for  <dig> min at  <dig> μl/min. a total of  <dig>  response units of gst and  <dig>  response units of gst-mad <dig> were immobilized. binding of 5ht was carried out at 25°c at  <dig> μl/min in hbs-ep. the amount of specific analyte bound was monitored by subtracting the response units from the reference cell  from the gst-mad <dig> immobilized cell. after each analyte injection, surfaces were regenerated with  <dig> mm naoh for  <dig>  sec at  <dig> μl/min. all sensorgram data presented are representative of at least  <dig> runs. sensorgrams were aligned to the injection time  using biaevaluation software, and the baselines averaged at response difference =  <dig> ru. curve fitting and binding kinetics parameters were calculated using graphpad prism software.

RESULTS
the epigenetic machinery controlled by hdac is involved in lr patterning upstream of nodal related  <dig> expression
xenopus embryos express a maternal form of hdac mrna that shows sequence homology to other hdacs  <cit> . the hdac activity present in early embryos appears to be mainly, if not exclusively, of the hdac-a type, that is of the vertebrate hdac i class  <cit> . although the biochemical properties of the xenopus hdac are well characterized  <cit> , knowledge about its mrna expression pattern is limited. we processed different stages of early embryos for in situ hybridization. hdac mrna was found to be expressed in all animal-pole blastomeres by the  <dig> cell stage  .

to probe the overall potential involvement of hdacs during xenopus lr patterning, we injected early embryos with mrna encoding a well-characterized dominant negative  form of the xenopus hdac  <cit> . embryos in which the dn hdac mrna was injected at the  <dig> cell stage exhibited a 17-fold increase in heterotaxia compared to controls , demonstrating that hdac is indeed functionally involved in embryonic lr patterning in xenopus. it should be noted that the penetrance of the phenotype is artificially reduced  in these experiments by titering down the reagents to sub-optimal levels . nevertheless, given the very low background incidence of heterotaxia in un-manipulated embryos, the level of laterality disturbance induced by our manipulations is unmistakably significant. moreover, when scoring three organs for situs, the maximum level of heterotaxia is  <dig> %, not 100%, since random independent assortment of  <dig> organs will sometimes result in a wild-type phenotype being mistakenly scored when all three organs randomly land in their correct positions.

next we sought to investigate whether the left and right sides of the embryo require different levels of hdac activity for proper organ situs. to test this hypothesis, we injected embryos at the  <dig> cell stage on the left  or on the right  side with the constructs hdac dn or hdac wt. indeed, embryos injected in either right blasomere with the hdac dn, and embryos injected with hdac wt on the left side, exhibited heterotaxia at stage  <dig> . embryos injected on the dorsal left side with hdac dn or hdac wt did not present significant levels of heterotaxia when compared to un-injected controls.

these data are consistent with a role for histone acetylation during lr development and demonstrate a lr-differential dependence on endogenous hdac activity. importantly, these data are not consistent with involvement of the hdac pathway in cilia-driven events in the gastrocoel roof plate . the ciliated grp cells derive from the dorsal precursors  <cit> , whereas our results show effects on ventral blastomere descendants ; moreover, it is now known that only the left side of the nodal flow is important for asymmetry at neurula stages  <cit> , while our data reveal effects on the descendants of right-side blastomeres.

as nr <dig> is the most upstream gene known in the asymmetric cascade of the frog embryo , we processed injected embryos at the stage  <dig> with a probe for xenopus nr <dig>  <dig>  in order to determine whether the pattern of xnr- <dig> expression was disrupted when early hdac activity was perturbed. indeed, embryos injected on the right side with hdac dn or on the left side with hdac wt exhibited a loss of the normal asymmetry of xnr- <dig> expression .

these results support a role for hdac activity in lr establishment and suggest that the epigenetic status of the chromatin may play a key role in determining the normally left-sided expression of xnr- <dig> 

only early xenopus hdac blockade affects the left right establishment
we next characterized the timing of epigenetic controls of xnr- <dig> expression, probing the function of hdac at the early developmental stages when 5ht signaling takes place  <cit> . we used a hdac blocker, sodium butyrate , capitalizing on the ability to use pharmacological reagents at different developmental stages . xenopus hdac class i activity present in early embryos has already been shown to be sensitive to hdac blockers  <cit> .

embryos at different developmental stages were separated into control groups and experimental groups and the latter were exposed to  <dig> mm nab . incubation of embryos with nab induced heterotaxia when exposures occurred between stage  <dig> and  <dig> . exposure to nab at any stage after stage  <dig> did not induce heterotaxia , confirming that the lr-relevant functions of hdac took place at cleavage stages .

nab treatment affects xenopus left-right patterning.

embryos were exposed to  <dig> mm nab during different stages of development, the drug was washed out and the embryos were allowed to develop until at stage  <dig> for organ placement score. nab treatment induced significant levels of heterotaxia if embryos were exposed to the drug from stage  <dig> to  <dig>  embryos exposed to the drug during xenopus ciliogenesis  or during nr- <dig> asymmetric expression in the lateral mesoderm plate  presented significant malformations and thus could not be used for laterality assessment.

we also processed nab treated embryos for xnr- <dig> in situ hybridization in order to correlate levels of heterotaxia with misexpression of xnr- <dig>  interestingly, a high percentage of embryos exposed to nab lacked xnr- <dig> . this reproduced the loss of xnr- <dig> expression resulting from the hdac dn mrna microinjection .

thus, these results indicate that the time window most sensitive to blockage of hdac overlaps with the developmental window in which the 5ht pathway was shown to be active  <cit> .

hdac blockade increases the levels of acetylated histone h <dig> in the early embryo
given that the normal function of hdac is associated with a loss of immunoreactivity related to acetylated nuclear h <dig>  <cit> , and as histone h <dig> is found in the xenopus egg and early embryos  <cit> , we investigated the impact of nab-induced hdac blockade on global h <dig> acetylation levels. whole protein lysates from embryos exposed to nab were analyzed by western blotting with a specific antibody against acetylated histone h <dig>  this analysis showed that the histone h <dig> acetylation levels were markedly increased by  <dig> mm nab treatment compared with control groups . there was a  <dig> -fold increase in acetylation levels in embryos exposed from stage 1- <dig>  and a  <dig> -fold increase in embryos exposed from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> or from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> .

these results are consistent with hdac functioning in the control of histones' acetylation levels during its regulation of lr asymmetry establishment.

the xnr- <dig> intronic region that contains the asymmetric element is targeted by the epigenetic machinery
our data indicate that very early epigenetic modifications control expression of xnr- <dig> at a much later developmental stage. thus, we tested the prediction that this epigenetic modification was made directly on the xnr- <dig> gene. the xnr- <dig> genomic region is composed of  <dig> main regulatory elements . the re on the promoter region  is located  <dig> bp from the start codon  <cit> . the second re is the ase  in the intron  <dig> of the xnr- <dig> gene. it is known to drive the asymmetric expression of xnr- <dig> in the lateral plate mesoderm   <cit>  .

because early hdac activity is necessary for the expression of xnr- <dig> at stage  <dig>  we asked whether the deposition of epigenetic markers due to early hdac blockade could cause xnr-1's repression later in development. more specifically, we also sought to map which region of the xnr- <dig> gene  was a target for the hdac machinery, and link the deposition of epigenetic markers to the repressed state of xnr- <dig> induced by nab treatment. we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation  assay with chromatin from embryos at stage  <dig> that had been exposed to nab early during development. we focused on three different markers: acetylated histones h <dig> and h <dig> , and h3k4me <dig>  because of the existence of crosstalk between histones' modifications  <cit>  and the fact that h3k4me <dig> modification is also associated with a repressed state of chromatin  <cit> . the h3h4me <dig> marker was particularly interesting because it has been associated with the epigenetic memory that precedes transcriptional control by several hours  <cit> , thus being an attractive candidate to transmit an epigenetic memory from early to late developmental stages in absence of transcription.

embryos were exposed to  <dig> mm nab from stage  <dig> to  <dig> and allowed to develop in plain mmr medium until stage  <dig>  at this stage the chromatin was isolated as described  <cit> . the chip experiment followed by qpcr analysis revealed that the level of acetylation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> and the levels of h3k4me <dig> in embryos exposed to nab early during development presented increased levels only on the intronic region , suggesting that higher levels of acetylated h <dig> due to hdac treatment led to deposition of di-methylated h <dig> on the intronic region.

taken together, these results indicate that nab treatment during early cleavage stages led to a hyperacetylated status of the chromatin and perturbed lr-relevant gene transcription occurring at late developmental stages.

a high-throughput proteomic analysis identified the hdac partner mad <dig> as a new component in 5ht signaling pathway
our evidence for epigenetic mechanisms operating at cleavage stages controlling much later transcriptional readouts in lr patterning led us to investigate how hdac activity could be modulated during early development. our model predicts such controls, because the hdac mrna is expressed symmetrically; thus, an asymmetric signal is needed to confer the observed consistent difference in hdac activity on the l and r sides. because rightward redistribution of maternal serotonin  during cleavage stages has been shown to be necessary for the establishment of lr asymmetry  <cit> , we sought mechanisms by which 5ht could couple to the epigenetic machinery.

we performed a high-throughput proteomic assay to identify novel 5ht binding proteins  present in the cytoplasmic fraction that may interact with known epigenetic machinery. a resin conjugated with 5ht was used for affinity capture analysis from whole protein lysate of xenopus laevis embryos at the  <dig> cell stage. two aliquots of 5ht-conjugated resin were loaded with either frog embryo lysate plus  <dig> mm 5ht  or frog embryo lysate . the eluate from both experiments was subjected to a 10% sds-page and, after proper sample preparation and trypsin in-solution digestion, the peptide mixtures were analyzed by lc/ms-ms.

the raw data collected from the ion trap mass spectrometer was analyzed for protein identification using a database for xenopus laevis. the screen identified  <dig> proteins as possible 5ht interactors. because we were interested in mechanisms by which intracellular 5ht binding proteins could couple to the cytoplasmic epigenetic machinery , we focused on candidate proteins with known interactions with hdac proteins and/or dna-binding domains. we did not recover the classical 5ht transmembrane receptors in this screen, since we focused our analysis on the cytoplasmic  protein fraction. indeed, our screen successfully identified  <dig> candidates with characteristics of cytoplasmic proteins and  <dig> candidate having a dna binding domain. this dna binding-protein was identified as the max-interacting transcriptional repressor mad <dig>  mad <dig> is involved in the control of the epigenetic state of cells, since it can antagonize transcription by recruiting co-repressor complexes that contain hdac i  <cit> . indeed, the repressive activity of mad proteins has been shown to be due to hdac activity and inhibited by hdac blockers  <cit> . mad proteins also interact with max, and this complex has been implicated in different aspects of cell biology and cancer transformation  <cit> .

mad <dig> protein and mrna are present in the early embryo
a role for mad <dig> as a new player in the 5ht signaling pathway during lr patterning requires that mad <dig> protein be already present in early embryos. indeed, mad <dig> mrna is present in the blastomeres at the 4-cell stage by in situ hybridization . by the 32- <dig> cell stage , mad <dig> mrna is found only in the animal cells.

to validate the presence of mad <dig> protein in early embryos, as detected on the ion trap mass spectrometer, we performed two different sets of analysis. in the first strategy we used a monoclonal anti-mad <dig> antibody to detect the endogenous mad <dig> protein in embryos at stage  <dig> . to confirm the specificity of this anti-mad <dig> antibody we injected embryos with the xenopus mad <dig> protein fused to the flag epitope at the  <dig> cell stage. the lysate was collected at the stage  <dig> and used for immunoblotting to detect the exogenous xenopus mad <dig>  indeed, the injected mad3-flag protein was detected migrating at  <dig> kda, the expected molecular size for the xenopus mad <dig> protein . taken together these results confirm that mad <dig> is present as a maternal mrna and protein at the early cleavage stages and thus is potentially available for interaction with 5ht and/or hdac.

mad <dig> is a new player during xenopus lr patterning
to examine a role for mad <dig> during lr patterning, we utilized  <dig> different constructs encoding loss-of-function and gain-of-function reagents for mad3: mad3vp <dig>  and engmad <dig>   <cit> .

to probe the requirement of mad <dig> between the left and right side of the embryo, the single dorsal or ventral, left or right blastomeres at the stage  <dig>  were injected with mrna encoding engmad <dig> or vp16mad <dig> along with the lineage tracer lacz mrna. the embryos were then scored for organ placement at stage  <dig>  whereas dorsal injections led to considerable toxicity, ventral left or right expression of the engmad <dig>  construct induced heterotaxia at a statistically significant level when compared to control eng-expressing embryos . conversely, embryos injected with vp16mad <dig> in the right ventral blastomere presented significant heterotaxia when compared with vp <dig> control injected embryos .

we also analyzed injected embryos with engmad <dig> or vp16mad <dig> by in situ hybridization with a xnr- <dig> probe. indeed, embryos expressing the repressive engmad <dig> construct on the left or right side showed xnr- <dig> absence, and embryos injected with the activating vp16mad <dig> on the right showed a consistent level of bilateral xnr- <dig> expression .

thus, mad <dig> gain-of-function on left  and a mad <dig> loss-of-function on the right  can both control xnr-1's transcriptional status. taken together, these results support mad <dig> as a new lr determinant, and are consistent with a role for mad <dig> as a modulator of xnr- <dig> expression.

the mad <dig> biological activity during lr establishment is dependent on 5ht
next we tested whether mad3's biological activity is dependent on 5ht. the first strategy was to carry out a binding assay using surface plasmon resonance   <cit> . recombinant mad <dig> protein expressed as a fusion with glutathione s-transferase  was immobilized in a biacore chip and a 5ht solution was then passed over the surface. to subtract possible non-specific binding, we used a reference surface in the same chip where gst alone was immobilized. 5ht showed a high association rate and a low dissociation rate . four different concentrations were examined, ranging from  <dig> μm to  <dig> mm. using a 1: <dig> langmuir fitting algorithm, we calculated the equilibrium dissociation constant to be in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> μm . based on the 5ht levels found in early embryos,  <dig>  pmol/egg  <cit> , we measured embryo diameters in order to calculated the endogenous concentration of 5ht. considering the whole embryo as a sphere , 5ht concentration can then be calculated as  <dig>  μm, which is very close to the kd values determined in vitro. it should be noted that 5ht is not homogeneously distributed in the whole embryo but concentrated in the right blastomeres descendants at the stage  <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, the local concentrations could be even higher than the ones calculated here, well above the determined dissociation constant. hence, these in vitro data does suggest that 5ht and mad <dig> form a complex in vivo.

the second strategy was to generate a mad <dig> mutant lacking 5ht-binding sites. to generate this mad <dig> mutant first we mapped the putative 5ht binding sites on mad <dig> by modeling the 3-dimensional structure for mad <dig> using the crystal structure of a lipocalin am <dig>  a well characterized 5ht-binding protein, complexed with 5ht  <cit> . we chose lipocalin because among all known 5ht binding proteins, including class-a gpcrs , a conserved salt bridge interaction exists between the amine group and an aspartic acid or glutamic acid residue on the protein  <cit> . in lipocalin am <dig>  this conserved salt bridge is formed between asp <dig> and the amine group of 5ht. the structural equivalent aspartic acid in mad <dig> is asp <dig>  thus the potential binding site for 5ht in mad <dig> was derived based on the corresponding binding site residues from lipocalin structure.

to gain insight into the physiological relevance of these putative 5ht binding sites on mad <dig>  we performed functional experiments with a mad <dig> mutant generated based on the structural modeling. based on the docking mode of 5ht in the mad <dig> structure, residues d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  q <dig> and q <dig> are proposed to form important components of the 5ht binding pocket on mad <dig> . an evaluation of the binding site residues was performed by designing a mad3-5mut-flag construct harboring mutations on the five amino acids predicted to be involved in the 5ht putative binding site . embryos injected with mad3-wt-flag at the  <dig> cell stage developed significant levels of randomization of the heart, gut and gall bladder  in the absence of other defects and with normal dorsoanterior development at stage 45; in contrast, the mad3-5mut did not induce this phenotype .

to confirm that the lack of biological activity presented by the mad3-5mut-flag was due to the abrogation of the 5ht putative binding site, we performed a co-ip assay with a 5ht antibody. because 5ht is evenly distributed in embryos from stage  <dig>  through stage  <dig> , we injected embryos at the  <dig> cell stage to probe mad's ability to bind to any available 5ht present in the embryo, and in turn, to test if this ability would be lost in mad3-5mut injected embryos. embryos were then injected at the 1-cell stage with mad3wt-flag or mad3-5mut-flag and whole embryo lysate was prepared at the stage  <dig>  and incubated with ati-5ht followed by immunoblotting with anti-flag. as predicted, the mad3-5mut-flag protein was not found in complex with 5ht  when compared to the co-ip performed with mad <dig> wt-flag injected embryos . these results confirm the importance of these  <dig> residues for the mad <dig> biological activity during laterality establishment due to 5ht. we conclude that serotonin binding is a key component of mad3's ability to functionally participate in lr patterning.

discussion
chromatin structure and epigenetic state as a new source of asymmetric information
the importance of chromatin remodeling for cancer and developmental biology is increasingly appreciated  <cit> . the epigenetic state of the cell can be characterized by modifications on histone proteins such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination  <cit> . one important epigenetic state is characterized by the levels of histone tail acetylation that are tightly controlled by hdacs  <cit> .

previous work has shown that the xenopus hdac protein is found at high concentrations in the oocyte nucleus and its levels remain constant through oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early cleavage stages but decreases after the blastula stage  <cit> . measurements of xenopus hdac activity indicate that it also remains constant from oogenesis until early embryogenesis and that it is sensitive to hdac blockers  <cit> , which is consistent with the data we obtained on its role in the early lr pathway. in addition, our study indicates that although hdac mrna is expressed in all animal blastomeres, hdac activity on the right side is important for lr, as hdac dn injections on the right side led to heterotaxia that was correlated with absence of xnr- <dig> expression. in addition, nab treatment shows that the critical hdac activity for lr development overlaps with 5ht signaling  during cleavage stages and takes place before cilia flow . the results of the molecular-genetic loss-of-function  confirm the targeting of the pharmacological reagent , while the latter offers the opportunity of temporally-limited exposure.

our results using the chip and qpcr analyses indicated that hdac inhibition led to accumulation of histones h <dig> and h <dig> and the epigenetic marker h3k4m <dig> in the intronic region of xnr- <dig>  this region is particularly critical for xnr- <dig> asymmetric expression and we propose that hdac activity targets this region of the xnr- <dig> gene. although the h3k4me <dig> marker has been associated with transcriptional activation when it occupies promoter regions  <cit> , it was also shown to be associated with repression  <cit> . interestingly, h3k4me2-enriched regions do not correlate with transcription start sites and have been proposed to control chromatin states over regulatory regions  <cit> . this feature is particularly interesting as h3k4me <dig> was found enriched only on the intronic region of xnr- <dig> that contains the asymmetric regulatory element. one hypothesis is that, after drug removal, the h3k4me <dig> marker remained stably tethered on the xnr- <dig> intronic region and led to its repression due to the recruitment of zygotic hdacs during late developmental stages.

the function of mad <dig> in the lr establishment
in agreement with our result indicating that the hdac block leads to an increase in histone h <dig> and h <dig> acetylation levels, mad signaling was shown to be important in the control of global levels of chromatin structure also characterized by acetylation of heterochromatin regions. indeed, mad proteins have been shown to coordinate chromatin modifications resulting in a significant decrease in acetylated histones h <dig> and h <dig> in cell culture  <cit> .

a key feature of 5ht signaling during xenopus lr development is that it functions during cleavage stages, prior to mid-blastula transition , and thus largely under zygotic transcriptional silence. it was previously shown that early 5ht signaling is important to the correct placement of xnr- <dig> expression on the left side of embryo  <cit> . indeed, constitutive repressive form of mad <dig> protein  can induce heterotaxia and blocks xnr- <dig> expression on the left side , which indicates its endogenous role as a repressor of xnr- <dig>  on the other hand, vp16mad <dig> injections could relieve the repressive state of xnr- <dig> on the right side leading to its ectopic expression at stage  <dig> . in contrast to transcriptional control of xnr- <dig>  we propose that the engmad <dig> phenotype is due to a constitutive recruitment of repressive elements of the cell machinery that can lead to a repressive state of the chromatin that can be maintained throughout development. conversely, the vp16mad <dig> phenotype is compatible with an open chromatin structure leading to the ectopic induction of xnr- <dig>  interestingly, injections with the hdac dn and vp16mad <dig> on the right and hdac wt and engmad <dig> on the left gave rise to consistent heterotaxia, indicating that mad <dig> and hdac functions during lr establishment take place in the same subset of blastomeres and may converge on nr <dig>  this hypothesis is corroborated by the presence of  <dig> putative mad binding sites canntg  <cit>  in the intronic region of nr <dig> . interestingly, the second site is placed in the region that contains the fast binding sites that are important to proper control the asymmetric expression of nr <dig> in the left side of the embryo  <cit> . this interesting feature suggests that mad protein could bind to this region of the nr <dig> gene. this analysis, along with the established status of mad <dig> as a very well-characterized partner for hdacs, indicates that 5ht/mad <dig> signaling could couple to repressive elements belonging to the epigenetic machinery of the early embryo. in addition, hdac and mad <dig> mrna symmetric expression patterns argue in favor of a symmetric distribution for both proteins. in this context, we hypothesize that 5ht binding on mad <dig> would be an asymmetric signal important to confer specificity for hdac activity in the context of lr development, decreasing the levels of histone acetylation on the nr1's intronic region .

indeed, a recent study has demonstrated an antidepressant-like effect for hdacs inhibitors similar to the effects of fluoxetine, an effective inhibitor for 5ht re-uptake,  <cit>  that randomizes lr asymmetry  <cit> . these data suggest a synergistic role for 5ht and hdac pathways, indicating they may be acting in the same pathway and reinforcing our model that brings together 5ht and epigenetic machinery.

how is the early lr signaling pathway transduced into a stable gene expression pattern at a late developmental stage?
in xenopus and many invertebrates, consistent asymmetry is determined by very early biophysical and physiological events taking place long before asymmetric gene expression and ciliary flow  <cit> . while these early mechanisms are mapped onto different embryonic architectures in a variety of ways throughout phyla  <cit> , left-sided xnr- <dig> expression is a well-conserved regulator of the situs of the heart and visceral organs  <cit> . our data on epigenetic modulation provide the first detailed glimpse into the molecular events that allow physiological events during very early stages to be solidified into cascades of gene expression.

analysis of the mouse and xenopus nr- <dig> gene has revealed a regulatory sequence in the coding region that is crucial for the asymmetric expression at the lpm and that is targeted by the complex fast/smads  <cit> . this asymmetric enhancer  sequence is present in the intronic region  <cit> . the transcription factor fast- <dig> mediates tgfβ signaling, and, together with smad- <dig> and - <dig>  has been shown to be necessary to trigger xnr- <dig> asymmetric expression by binding to the xnr- <dig> ase in the lpm  <cit> . however, all signaling molecules that play a role in the asymmetric expression of nr- <dig> characterized so far are symmetrically expressed in the lpm, including the immediate upstream player fast- <dig>  <cit> . thus, it becomes crucial to understand how upstream symmetric events taking place at the cellular levels result in reliably asymmetric nr- <dig> expression. in addition, it is known that the right side of the embryo has an intrinsic ability to express xnr- <dig>  indicating that the cells on the right side have all machinery needed to express xnr- <dig> but are normally repressed from doing so  <cit> .

our results show that the xnr- <dig> intronic region contains high levels of acetylated histone h <dig> and h <dig> and h3k4me <dig> after nab treatment  and this correlates with absence of xnr- <dig> expression. although the biological significance in terms of transcriptional outcomes due to h3k4me <dig> is still under debate, it is becoming clear that this epigenetic marker may prevent aberrant gene expression or modulate transcriptional outcomes  <cit> . in the context of our results, a possible interpretation is that h3k4me <dig> could work as a repressive marker facilitating the efficiency of inhibition by lefty. in normal embryos these results suggest that hdac could target the xnr- <dig> intronic region  early during development leading to a decrease in the levels of acetylated histones h <dig> and as a consequence preventing h2k4me <dig> from being deposited in this region, making this region accessible to fast related proteins. by the time of xnr- <dig> expression initiation, the absence of h3k4me <dig> would increase the efficiency of activation of xnr- <dig> expression, which will not result in significant noise, leading to stable expression of xnr- <dig> 

future experiments addressing the balance in acetylation and methylation levels of histones between left and right sides of the embryo will be necessary to understand how the epigenetic machinery controls different elements during lr determination besides nr <dig>  for instance, the investigation of epigenetic modifications on other left-right genes, such as lefty and pitx will be important to understand how global hdac activity blockade changes the chromatin status and how these changes are transduced into different states of lr genes' activity. for example, lefty is an inhibitor of nr <dig> and any epigenetic change on lefty due to hdac blockade may also affect nr <dig> expression, providing a possible explanation on the absence of xnr- <dig> expression when hdac activity is blocked. this hypothesis is supported by the feed-forward and feedback loop between nr <dig> and lefty that is important to exclude nodal from being expressed on the right side of the embryo. consistent with this rationale, our data implicate hdac activity as important to set nr <dig> expression but also suggest that hdac activity may target lefty, leading to its ectopic expression on the left side that ultimately will repress nr <dig> expression. for this reason, a comprehensive understanding of the epigenetic regulation of the key asymmetric genes, and the upstream components linking the sidedness of transcription to early physiological gradients, will be a crucial aspect of fleshing out a most fascinating aspect of left-right patterning.

CONCLUSIONS
hdac activity is a new lr determinant controlling the transcription of the xnr- <dig> gene. molecular-genetic and pharmacological blockade of hdac activity led to deposition of epigenetic markers on the xnr- <dig> gene that was correlated with misexpression of xnr- <dig> and organ heterotaxia. the known hdac partner mad <dig> is also a new functional lr determinant whose biological activity during lr establishment is dependent on 5ht. taken together these data suggest a model in which epigenetic machinery transduces early physiological gradients into much later transcriptional effectors during establishment of consistent organ situs in vertebrate embryogenesis.
