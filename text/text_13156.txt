BACKGROUND
cytochrome p450s form a huge superfamily of heme-containing monooxygenases present in all domains of life. these are pivotal in detoxification of xenobiotics, drug metabolism, assimilation of carbon sources and formation of secondary metabolites. presently, there are more than  <dig> p <dig> genes that have been identified across all the kingdoms of life  <cit> . the preponderance of p450s is more in plants per species than in animals and their content in angiosperm genomes can reach up to 2%  <cit> . plant cellular and metabolic processes are dependent on p450s to drive the reactions such as hydroxylation, oxidative demethylation, desaturation, epoxidation, oxidative rearrangement of the carbon skeleton and oxidative c–c bond cleavage  <cit> . p450s are endoplasmic reticulum  localised, requiring auxiliary reductases for the activation of molecular oxygen for different reactions. these reductases transfer two electrons in a single step from cofactor nadh to heme centre of p450s  <cit> . p <dig> monooxygenases constitute a highly regio and stereo-specific class of definite substrate-specific enzymes. by gene annotations approximately, 1% of the total genes in arabidopsis thaliana and other model plants are found to be cytochrome p450s. arabidopsis genome contains  <dig> genes and  <dig> pseudo-genes representing cytochrome p <dig>  <cit> . involvement of p450s in diverse physiological processes in vivo, leads to biosynthesis and catabolism of huge array of complex metabolites like lignin, pigments, defence compounds, fatty acids, hormones and signaling molecules .

owing to their regio and stereo-specific catalysing versatility, these are potential targets for industrial biocatalysis. p450s have been applied in industry for the investigation of new drugs, medicine or xenobiotics . remarkable variety of chemical reactions catalysed and enormous number of substrates attacked, have earned p450s the reputation of “the most versatile biological catalysts in nature” . thus, emphasizing identification and characterization of p450s for elucidation of various biosynthetic pathways. plant p450s are presumed to be polyphyletic in their origin and generally classified into two main clades, a-type and non-a-type. a-type p450s are involved in ‘plant specific metabolism’ and are responsible for the biosynthesis of diverse natural products  <cit> .

withania somnifera is a medicinal plant of immense repute known to synthesize a suite of low molecular weight natural products such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, tannins, resins and sterols through secondary metabolism . these metabolites are derived from distinct metabolic pathways. the main constituents reported for significant pharmacological activities are withanolides, a group of naturally occurring triterpenoids. withanolides are synthesized via both mevalonate  and non-mevalonate  pathways  <cit> . recently, we have elucidated the regulatory role of three branch point oxidosqualene cyclases  which showed that repression of β-amyrin synthase and lupeol synthase led to diversion of common precursor flux towards cycloartenol synthase resulting in enhanced accumulation of withanolides  <cit> . we have also characterized two paralogs of cytochrome p <dig> reductase  wherein wscpr <dig> expression was inducible in response to exogenous elicitors  <cit> . two more genes namely squalene synthase and squalene epoxidase were also characterized from same plant species  <cit> . the regulation pattern of squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase, cycloartenol synthase and wscpr <dig> and wscpr <dig> in leaves and roots at various developmental stages in relation to dynamics of withanolides accumulation, indicated towards their tissue-specific biosynthesis  <cit> . in our earlier findings, we have reported that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate  and salicylic acid  increases withanolide content due to the presence of stress regulatory elements within the upstream promoter regions of their genes  <cit> .

we, in present study report isolation, heterologous expression and transcript profiling of two a-type p <dig> monooxygenases viz. wscyp98a  and wscyp76a . these are supposed to be involved mainly in the shikmate and phenylpropanoid pathway biosynthesizing the various defence molecules during biotic and abiotic stress. cyp98a  catalyzes the meta-hydroxylation of p-coumarate derivatives for the biosynthesis of lignins and chlorogenic acid, which constitutes a crucial bottleneck in phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . the members of cyp <dig> gene family characterized from many plant species are known to catalyse various oxidative reactions. for instance, catharanthus roseus cyp76a <dig> converts both iridodial and iridotrial into 7-deoxyloganetic acid. whereas, c. roseus cyp76b <dig> and cyp76c <dig> from a. thaliana execute hydroxylation of geraniol  <cit> .

in present investigation, full length genes of wscyp98a and wscyp76a were cloned and heterologously expressed in escherichia coli. wscyp98a shares maximum homology with reported cyp98a of capsicum annum  and solanum tuberosum  whereas, wscyp76a was similar to cyp76a <dig> of s. tuberosum  and s. melongena . the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that both genes belong to their respective families and are close homologs to other cyp98a and cyp76a genes of solanaceae family. the prediction of three dimensional structures, ligand binding site and conserved amino acid residues of both proteins were done using homology modelling analysis. the transcript profiling of wscyp98a and wscyp76a in different tissues of w. somnifera was performed using quantitative real time pcr . expression profiles in response to exogenous elicitors namely meja, sa and gibberellic acid  were also studied for both the p450s. empirical findings reveal their possible role in defence mechanism via enhanced accumulation of withanolides. purview of literature suggests that this is the only report of type-a wscyp98a and wscyp76a from w. somnifera.

amplification of wscyp98a and wscyp76a
degenerate primers  based on the conserved regions of p450s were designed by multiple sequence alignment of different p <dig> monooxygenases sequences retrieved from the genbank database at national center for biotechnology information . optimization of polymerase chain reaction conditions allowed amplification of cdna fragments of wscyp98a and wscyp76a under following cycling conditions: one cycle of 94°c for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94°c for 30 s, 55–60°c for 30 sec and 72°c for 1 min followed by a final extension of 72°c for 10 min in a thermal cycler . amplicons examined by agarose gel electrophoresis were cloned into ptz57r/t vector , and then transformed into e. coli dh5α host strain. cloned amplicons were sequenced using an automated dna sequencer . the nucleotide sequences obtained were analysed using the similarity search blast program and subsequently used for designing gene specific primers .table  <dig>

RESULTS
molecular cloning of wscyp98a and wscyp76a
p <dig> superfamily contain genes of diverse functions involved both in primary as well as secondary metabolism. these are heme-thiolate proteins containing iron atom coordinated to a proximal cysteine and receive electrons from nadh via a fad-domain of auxiliary reductases. in the present investigation, two monooxygenases from w. somnifera, wscyp98a and wscyp76a have been isolated and expressed in e. coli bl <dig> . quantitative assessment of gene expression pattern in different plant organs and relative transcript abundance in response to exogenous elicitors was also evaluated and corroborated with withanolide production to extrapolate and infer their possible role during biotic and abiotic stresses.

full length cdnas of wscyp98a and wscyp76a genes were obtained from the leaf tissue of ws- <dig> rich chemo-variant by degenerate pcr and race methods . degenerate primers based on conserved regions were designed by employing multiple sequence alignment strategy using clustalw. a 550 bp and 520 bp core fragments were obtained from initial rt-pcr reactions. the amplicons were confirmed as members of cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families by sequencing and similarity searches using blastn. further, extension of both amplified core fragments toward 5′ and 3′ ends by using race-pcr succeeded in amplification of remaining cdna portions. using gsps designed from start codons and stop codons, 1536 bp and 1548 bp open reading frames  were amplified from the pool of leaf cdna designated as wscyp98a and wscyp76a and theses encoded  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues respectively . the first methionine as per first-aug rule was considered as initiator codon. wscyp98a contains downstream untranslated region  at 3′ ends whereas wscyp76a comprises of 3′-utr of 180 bp. similarity search showed wscyp98a shares 65-95% homology with protein sequences of many other species while wscyp76a shares 39-89% homology.figure  <dig>

in silico characterization of deduced wscyp98a and wscyp76a
wscyp98a and wscyp76a have predicted isoelectric points  <dig>  and  <dig>  and molecular masses of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda respectively. multiple sequence alignment with p450s of taxonomically diverse species showed presence of cysteine heme ligand signature which is characteristic signature of p <dig> sequences this motif was detected at positions 434– <dig> aa  and 444– <dig> aa  for wscyp98a and wscyp76a respectively . like all eukaryotic monooxygenases, a string of amino acid residues which helps in anchoring to er membrane was detected at the n-terminal end of each monooxygenase. this membrane anchor region is also essential for normal interaction between p450s and their redox partners. their presence was also predicted by tmhmm and split  <dig>  bioinformatics programs . to ascertain the degree of evolutionary relatedness, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed with mega  <dig>  software from the clustalw alignment of wscyp98a and wscyp76a with a number of homologous p <dig> sequences of different plants retrieved from the ncbi genbank database. wscyp98a and wscyp76a corresponded to two separate phylogenetic clans in accordance with the amino acid similarity among their proteins . prediction of secondary structure of wscyp98a and wscyp76a proteins by sopma program revealed that they consist of α-helixes , β-turns  joined by extended strands , and random coils . three dimensional structural models for wscyp98a and wscyp76a were generated using phyre <dig> with >90% accuracy on the basis of homology based modelling using cytochrome p <dig> 1a <dig>  as template . the amino acid residues involved in ligand binding were also predicted using the 3dligandsite tool as depicted in figure 4b and d. analysis of the evolutionary conservation of wscyp98a and wscyp76a amino acids were performed using consurf program. several residues with high scores were found to be functional and structural residues of the proteins by conseq servers . ramachandran plot analysis of wscyp98a showed  <dig> aa  residues in the most favourable region,  <dig> aa  residues in the additional allowed region and  <dig>  in the outlier region. similarly, in case of wscyp76a,  <dig> aa  residues were in the most favourable region,  <dig> aa  residues in the additional allowed region and  <dig>  in the outlier region .figure  <dig>

heterologous expression in e. coli
for heterologous expression, entire coding sequences of wscyp98a and wscyp76a cdnas were expressed in e. coli using pgex 4 t- <dig> expression vector system. the orfs were released from pjet-wscyp98a and pjet-wscyp76a using bamhi/sali restriction enzymes, and inserted into vector pgex4t- <dig>  the recombinant expression vectors with the inserted wscyp98a and wscyp76a constructs were identified by pcr analysis and restriction digestion using bamhi/sali. heterologous expression of proteins was induced with different concentrations of iptg. sds-page analysis demonstrated that optimum expression of proteins was observed at 25°c using  <dig>  mm iptg after 6–8 h of induction. the fusion protein having molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda and ~ <dig>  kda appeared in the lysate of recombinant e. coli transformed with the expression cassettes pgex-wscyp98a and pgex-wscyp76a, respectively . the apparent molecular masses of these recombinant proteins were in good agreement with molecular mass of gst  and those calculated from the deduced primary structures of wscyp98a and wscyp76a proteins. previously, we were able to optimize the functional expression of wscprs in soluble fraction with its membrane anchor  <cit> . nevertheless, wscyp98a and wscyp76a were not expressed in soluble fraction in ample amount. maximum amount of recombinant protein of two p450s were localized to inclusion bodies which hindered their purification.figure  <dig>

tissue-specific gene expression analysis
to study wscyp98a and wscyp76a gene expression pattern in different tissues of w. somnifera, cdna libraries were prepared separately from rna samples extracted from leaves, stalks, roots, flowers and berries  of four month old plant. tissue-specific cdnas were used as templates for qrt-pcr. the results showed highest expression of wscyp98a in stalk . similar findings have been reported for coumarate 3-hydroxylase in a. thaliana where the distribution of transcripts was more preponderant in stem. high frequencies of cyp98a transcripts have also been observed in poplar and pine xylem, soybean hypocotyl and stem, as well as cotton fibres indicating towards its higher expression in lignin synthesizing tissues . however, two closely related homologs cyp98a <dig> and cyp98a <dig> expressed predominantly in floral tissues which is very distinct from other cyp <dig> members. the higher expression in floral tissue probably helps in pollen coat development  <cit> . wscyp76a transcripts were found predominantly expressing in roots of w. somnifera . likewise, expression of cyp76a <dig> was reported higher in petunia roots. higher expression of wscyp76a in roots possibly protects plant against attack by plant pathogens  <cit> . the comparative analysis of transcriptomes in salvia miltiorrhiza showed abundant expression of cyp76ah <dig> in roots rather than other plant tissues and found to be involved in tanshinone biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . the least expression of both monooxygenases was observed in berries.figure  <dig>

effect of elicitors on wscyp98a and wscyp76a
in vitro cultures established via micro-propagation were used for meja, sa and ga <dig> treatments. micro-shoots were grown for 2 weeks in ms liquid medium. subsequently, micro-shoots were supplemented with meja , sa  and ga <dig>  for 48 h. the untreated were kept as control. samples were harvested after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h of interval. equal amounts of dnase-treated rna  of control and treated samples were converted into cdna. the effect of meja, sa and ga <dig> on expression profile of wscyp98a and wscyp76a was studied using qrt-pcr.

one of the important endogenous plant hormones meja is known to modulate biosynthesis of many of the secondary metabolites that play crucial role in the adaptation of plants to various biotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . meja has been reported to stimulate the biosynthesis of alkaloids by inducing the expression of several genes from the monoterpenoid branch of the monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . in present study, meja induced expression of both p450s post 48 h of treatment. wscyp98a showed 2-fold increase in expression after 48 h of application of meja while wscyp76a showed 6-fold increase in the expression after 48 h of meja application .figure  <dig>

were added to the micro-propagated plantlets pre-cultured for 2 weeks on ms liquid medium. the samples were harvested at time points of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h. actin was kept as internal control. data were compared and analysed with analysis of variance . experiments were performed in triplicate with similar results with standard errors indicated by bars, representing three independent biological samples, each with three technical replicates.



sa has been studied in detail as stress signaling molecule. it is implicated in signal transduction of numerous processes including the biosynthesis of some important secondary metabolites in plants . sa has been demonstrated to induce the accumulation of triterpenoids, ginsenosides in panx ginseng and glycyrrhizin in glycyrrhizaglabra, respectively  <cit> . production of sesquiterpenoids, such as bilobalide in ginkgo biloba and artemisinin in artemisia annua are also stimulated by exogenous application of sa  <cit> . sa treated plantlets showed upto  <dig> - <dig> fold increase in accumulation of wscyp98a and wscyp76a after time points of 24 h and 48 h, respectively . the results obtained are fully in agreement with the previous studies wherein microarray analysis revealed up-regulation of several p450s from a. thaliana in response to sa treatment  <cit> . likewise, enhanced expression of cyp98a <dig> gene has been noticed in physilus vulgaris when leaves were treated with derivatives of salicylic acids  <cit> . the induction of ljc3h in lonicera japonium has been induced by the treatment of meja and uv radiation  <cit> . up-regulation of transcript levels of wscyp98a and wscyp76a in response to elicitors may be due to their possible implication in defence mechanism.

cyp98a is key gene of phenylpropanoid pathway which leads to formation of flavonoids, phenolic and lignin. during pathogens attack and wound healing, deposition of lignin and suberin synthesis occurs in the cell wall  <cit> . thus, the abundance of transcripts of wscyp98a in treated plantlets appears to be a defence response due to elicitor triggered stimulus. the expression of wscyp76a have also enhanced in response to meja and sa treatment. members of same family like cyp76b <dig> is strongly induced by meja treatment along with other terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis genes in c. roseus cell culture. after 48 h of meja treatment the expression of wscyp76a was about 6-fold higher than control. closely related homologs of cyp <dig> family are mainly involved in biosynthesis of phytoalexin and are mostly multifunctional oxidases such as cyp76m <dig>  which seem to be involved in the production of antifungal phytocassanes  <cit> . cyp76b <dig> has been shown to be a highly specialized multifunctional enzyme catalyzing two sequential oxidation steps leading to the formation of 8-oxogeraniol from geraniol  <cit> .

ga <dig> is a diterpene plant growth regulator, controlling various growth and developmental process from seed germination to flower and fruit development. broadly, gas have been implicated in various cross talk mechanisms among different signaling pathways triggered by other plant growth regulators  <cit> . it impinges on a common transcription module of other phytohormones thus promoting many similar developmental responses in plants  <cit> . it has also been contended that ga <dig> orchestrates the metabolite fluxes between the primary and secondary metabolism influencing the production of isoprenoids and carotenoids  <cit> . exogenous application of ga <dig> resulted in decrease in the expression of wscyp98a as well as wscyp76a . lowest transcript levels were observed after 24 h of treatment which indicated that ga <dig> acts as negative regulator of these two genes. after 48 h of treatment the transcript accumulation of wscyp98a was comparable to control while as wscyp76a showed  <dig> -fold higher expression in comparison to control.

effect of elicitors on accumulation of withanolides
elicitor treatment is an efficient strategy to induce de novo synthesis of secondary metabolites. endogenous signal molecules like meja and sa act as key signaling compounds in various stress responses and plants subjected to various vagaries often result in higher accumulation of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolic compounds and phytoalexins  <cit> . to establish a correlation between expression profiles and metabolite flux, withanolides extracted from the treated samples were subjected to hplc analysis . there was appreciable increase in ws- <dig> and ws- <dig> over a period of time in response to elicitor treatments. in meja treated samples, there was a significant increase in ws- <dig>  and ws- <dig>  . sa treated samples showed marked increase in both ws- <dig>  and ws- <dig> with no traces of ws- <dig> . estimation of withanolide accumulation in ga <dig> treated samples demonstrated a gradual decline in ws- <dig>  while as ws- <dig> increased moderately up to 24 h  but after 48 h there was a slight decrease in ws- <dig> . ws- <dig> level also peaked at 6 h  in ga <dig> treated plantlets followed by a decrease at 24 h  and un-detectable concentration after 48 h . absence or low production of ws- <dig> is possibly linked to inherently lower levels of ws- <dig> accumulation even in cultivated accessions of w. somnifera  <cit> . application of exogenously applied phytohormones has been shown to impinge on physiological and metabolic processes in many plant organs and cell cultures. in some of the reports accumulation of anthocyanins, glutathione and flavonoids have shown varied response to ga <dig> treatments  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
time-course effect of elicitor treatments on withanolides accumulation in response to  methyl jasmonate ,  salicylic acid  and  gibberellic acid  at different time points. variation in three key withanolides viz. withanolide a , withanone  and withaferine a  was confirmed by hplc analysis at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h. all values obtained were means of triplicate with standard errors. time course accumulation of ws- <dig>  ws- <dig> and ws- <dig> was statistically significant at *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig>  and ***p <  <dig>  levels.



in our previous reports, meja and sa up-regulated the expression of squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase and wscpr <dig> genes which play an important regulatory role in the phytosterol biosynthesis  <cit> . these elicitors are important components of signal transduction cascades activating plant’s defence response against pathogen attack and often result in increased metabolite accumulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the increased demand of secondary metabolites for medicinal purposes coupled with low yield and supply has spurred the interest in enhanced production of bioactive metabolites. recent developments and upsurge in synthetic biology approach in combination with rapid advances in systems biology and metabolic engineering have enabled the manipulation of genome of microorganisms to produce heterologous molecules in a manner that was previously much more demanding in terms of integrating the metabolic circuitries in heterologous host  <cit> . p450s play a critical role in heterologous and homologous systems as they are able to catalyse regio- and stereospecific hydroxylation reactions that are extremely difficult to carry out using chemical methods  <cit> . these p450-catalysed reactions are pivotal steps in the biosynthesis of variety of compounds and optimization of p <dig> enzyme activities are key targets in yield improvement efforts to render such approaches economically feasible  <cit> . the characterization of p450s and their role in biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites is a fascinating area of investigation. present endeavour was aimed towards identification and characterization of different p <dig> monooxygenases from w. somnifera. we were able to clone two important p <dig> monoxygenases from withania which seem to play an active role in defence mechanism by coping up with biotic or abiotic stresses. it also gets reflected in higher accumulation of withanolides. the full length genes were successfully transformed in e. coli for heterologous expression. time-course study revealed that iptg had positive influence on protein expression in e. coli. expression pattern for wscyp98a and wscyp76a in different plant tissues was studied using qrt-pcr which showed highest expression of wscyp98a in stalk but the expression of wscyp76a was more obvious in roots. in present study, meja and sa acted as positive regulators whereas ga <dig> behaved as a negative regulator for wscyp98a and wscyp76a. to establish a correlation between enhanced transcript levels in response to activation of defence mechanism we also analysed withanolide accumulation. as the elicitors play key role as signaling molecules during stress conditions and enhance production of secondary metabolites, we observed discernible changes in withanolide concentrations. meja elicitation significantly increased the ws- <dig> accumulation over a period of 48 h. these results were in conformity with our earlier studies where meja and sa mediated induction of squalene synthase, squalene epoxidase and wscpr <dig> also led to enhanced withanolide content  <cit> . ga <dig> was found to be a negative regulator and resulted in low levels of mrna transcripts. the accumulation of withanolides in ga <dig> treated samples showed remarkable decrease in ws- <dig> and ws- <dig> accumulation. these results are positively corroborating with some of our earlier findings where the exogenous application of ga <dig> resulted in decrease in the cycloartenol synthase at translational level resulting in the decline of withanolide content  <cit> . possibly, ga <dig> application diverts the flux towards the formation of primary metabolites for cell elongation and development because it has been reported to be associated with the promotion of germination, growth, and flowering  <cit> . for homologous modulation of withanolide biosynthetic pathway, we have successfully incited the induction of transformed hairy roots using agrobacterium rhizogenes. hairy roots provide an excellent experimental system to understand the regulatory role of different p450s with their redox partners for enhanced production of withanolides .
