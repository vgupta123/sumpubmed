BACKGROUND
epilepsy results from the imbalance of excitability and inhibition of neuronal networks  <cit> . patients with different types of epilepsy may experience either daytime sleepiness or nighttime sleep disturbance . the prevalence of sleep disorders, such as excessive daytime sleepiness  <cit> , insomnia  <cit>  and obstructive sleep apnea  <cit>  is higher among patients with epilepsy.

interleukin-1β , one of the somnogenic factors, enhances non-rapid eye movement  sleep by acting at the basal forebrain  <cit>  and the ventrolateral preoptic area   <cit> . two types of il- <dig> receptors  have been identified: the type  <dig> receptor  and the type  <dig> receptor . il-1r <dig> dominantly distributes throughout the brain and carries out the main function of nrem sleep enhancement  <cit> . il-1r <dig> ko mice decrease sleep during the dark period of the light:dark cycle when compared with the wildtype mice  <cit> . il- <dig> is also identified as one of the proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to the pathogenesis of epilepsy during inflammation. the concentrations of il-1β increase and the number of il- <dig> receptors are up-regulated during seizures  <cit> . existing evidence indicates that the increased concentrations of il-1β may affect the seizure threshold, but the role of il-1β in the epileptogenesis is still controversial, as both a proconvulsant and an anticonvulsant have been suggested. growing evidence supports il- <dig> as a proconvulsant substance. seizure activities are inhibited after the injection of the il- <dig> receptor antagonist  and seizures are also suppressed in mice with over-expressed il-1ra  <cit> . on the other hand, the anticonvulsant effects of il- <dig> are also suggested in other studies. il- <dig> augments the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid -a receptors and increases the pentylenetetrazol -induced seizure threshold in mice  <cit> . intracerebroventricular  injections of il-1β suppress the amygdaloid kindling-induced seizures in rats  <cit> . furthermore, il- <dig> exhibits a temporal and dose-dependent influence on sleep regulation. low doses of il- <dig> increase nrem sleep during the night and slow wave activity during the day; in contrast, high doses of il- <dig> suppress nrem sleep during the day and slow wave activity at night  <cit> . the opposite actions of high- and low-doses of il- <dig> may explain the divergent effects. because of the conflicts between those observations, the role of il- <dig> in epileptogenesis needs to be further determined. we herein hypothesized that il-1r <dig> mediates the pathogenesis of epilepsy and the epilepsy-induced sleep disturbances. in this study, we examined il-1r <dig> in the kindling-induced epileptogenesis and sleep disruptions by employing il-1r <dig> −/− mice.

our previous results have demonstrated that epilepsy occurring at different zeitgeber time  points alters sleep differently  <cit> . kindled epilepsy at zt <dig> decreases nrem sleep during the light period; in contrast, kindling stimulation at zt <dig> increases nrem sleep during the dark period  <cit> . at zt <dig>  corticotropin-releasing hormone  mediates kindling-induced nrem sleep reduction, and at zt <dig>  the increases in il- <dig> are attributed to kindling-induced nrem sleep enhancement  <cit> . furthermore, we further found that at zt <dig>  kindling epilepsy shifts the fluctuation of period circadian protein homolog  <dig> protein  in the suprachiasmatic nucleus  of the hypothalamus and alters sleep circadian rhythm  <cit> . these results suggest that epilepsy may alter either homeostatic factors or circadian rhythms to cause sleep disturbances. in this study, we further determined our hypothesis that at zt <dig>  il-1r <dig> mediates kindling-induced sleep disruption by using il-1r <dig> +/+ and il-1r <dig> −/− mice.

methods
animals
male c57bl/ <dig>  mice  were used in present study. the original il-1r <dig> −/− ko mice were obtained from jackson laboratory  and bred in house. the wildtype c57bl/ <dig> mice  were purchased from biolasco taiwan co., ltd. the polymerase chain reaction  analysis of brain tissue was performed to confirm the genotype of il-1r <dig> ko mice used in experiments and to confirm any genetic drift during breeding . all experiments and animal care were performed following the principles outlined in the institutional animal care and use committee  of national taiwan university. mice were anesthetized with zoletil  and xylazine , treated with antibiotics  to prevent infection, and surgically implanted with two electroencephalographic  electrodes  and a bipolar stimulating electrode. the placements of eeg electrodes were at the left frontal lobe and right parietal lobe. the bare ends of the insulated leads from the eeg electrodes were connected to dupont female terminals and a  <dig>  mm 2p dupont connector. bipolar insulated electrodes  were placed in the left basolateral nucleus of the amygdala  as the target of kindling stimuli. the coordinates of the bla were  <dig>  mm caudal to bregma,  <dig>  mm lateral to bregma, and  <dig>  mm ventral to the dura  <cit> . the dupont connector and bipolar electrodes were cemented to the skull with dental acrylic . ibuprofen was added to their drinking water for 5 days after the surgery to reduce pain. five days after the eeg implantation, the dupont connector was connected to the amplifier system for habituation. all animals were housed separately in a recording cage and were housed in a 12:12 h light:dark  cycle in an isolated room where the temperature was maintained at 23 ± 1 °c. food and water were provided ad libitum.

pcr genotyping

for the pcr genotyping analysis in each mouse,  <dig>  cm sections of the tail tips were dissolved in  <dig>  ml of directpcr lysis reagent  and  <dig>  mg/ml of proteinase k  solutions under the following conditions: 55 °c for 6–7 h, 85 °c for 45 min, 25 °c for 5 min , and then precipitated by centrifuging for 10 s. one μl of lysate was used for 50 μl pcr reactions with mytaq hs mix . we used the primers recommended by jackson laboratory for genotyping . the expected pcr band for il1r <dig> +/+ is 310 bps and the band for il-1r <dig> −/− is 150 bps. the heterozygous  mice revealed both bands of  <dig> and 150 bps. pcr was performed by a c <dig> thermocycler . the parameters for reaction temperature cycles were 94 °c for 2 min, and then  <dig> cycles of 94 °c for 20 s, 65 °c for 15 s , and 68 °c for 10 s, followed by  <dig> cycles of 94 °c for 15 s, 60 °c for 10 s, and 72 °c for 10 s. we analyzed 5 μl of pcr reactions by using  <dig> % agarose gel electrophoresis . all samples and dna markers  were mixed with 6× loading buffers  and slowly loaded into the slots of submerged gel in the electrophoresis chamber . the gels were run at 100 v for 20 min. we examined the gel by uv illumination and photographed the gel as shown in fig.  <dig>  the primers are listed in table  <dig>  mice used in this experiment were genotyped to confirm no genetic drift .

kindling manipulation

nine days after surgery, mice were treated with rapid electrical amygdala kindling   <cit>  to develop epilepsy. a 2-channel general-purpose stimulus generator  was used to deliver the kindling stimuli. the after-discharge threshold  was determined for each mouse by giving a series of stimulus intensities, which started from 20 μa and increased by 20 μa every 2 min until epileptiform after-discharge  spikes appeared on eegs within 10 s after the stimulation. ad spikes are defined as spikes of over 2 hz and at least three times higher than the baseline eeg amplitude. mice, not manifesting any ad spikes with a stimulus intensity of 250 μa were excluded from the experiment. the intensity of kindling stimuli depended on individual adt intensity of each mouse. a total of  <dig> stimuli were given through the bipolar electrode into the bla. the stimulus was a train of monophasic pulses  of 100 hz for 3 s, and the stimulation was given every 5 min over a total of 200 min. the severity of seizures was scored according to the  <dig> grade modifications of racine’s classification: stage  <dig>  facial clonus; stage  <dig>  head nodding; stage  <dig>  unilateral forelimb clonus; stage  <dig>  rearing with bilateral forelimb clonus; stage  <dig>  rearing and falling ; stage  <dig>  running or bouncing seizures; stage  <dig>  tonic hind limb extension  <cit> . mice that exhibited epileptiform eegs induced by a single stimulus with the intensity of 300 μa at zt <dig> after the reak protocol were considered as a successful induction of epilepsy by kindling.

experimental protocols
two groups of mice were used in this study. group  <dig>  was used to determine the normal sleep and sleep alteration induced by kindling in wildtype  mice at zt <dig> and group  <dig>  was used to determine the kindling-induced sleep disturbance in the il-1r <dig> −/− mice at zt <dig>  all recordings started at the beginning of the dark period  and continued for 24 h . a 24-h baseline eeg was acquired as the control before the reak protocol, and no electrical impulses were given at any time before and throughout the baseline recording. then,  <dig> stimuli of reak were given through the bipolar electrode into the left basolateral amygdala . mice in all groups received a zt13-kindling stimulus on the next day  after the reak procedure. until epileptiform spikes induced by the zt13-kindling manifested on eegs, the mice were continuously recorded for 2 days  to evaluate their sleep alteration.

statistical analysis for sleep recordings
all values of sleep recordings are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . repeated measures analysis of variance  was performed to analyze the differences in the vigilance states and sleep-architecture parameters across the dark period, light period and specific time blocks. if statistically significant differences were detected, post hoc  multiple range tests were used. an α level of p value < <dig>  was taken as indicating a statistically significant difference between groups.

statistical analysis for seizure threshold
all adt intensities are presented as mean ± sem. two-way anova was performed to evaluate the differences of adt intensities between groups, and between successful-kindled and failure-kindled mice. the successful rate of kindling is presented as the percentage. fisher’s exact test was performed to compare the successful kindling rates between groups. mann–whitney u test was used to examine the differences of racine’s stage seizures in successful-kindled mice. the p value < <dig>  was taken as indicating a statistically significant difference between groups.

discussion
many epileptic patients suffer from sleep disturbances, which enormously reduce their quality of life  <cit> . although the comorbidity of epilepsy and sleep disorders is generally evidenced, the underlying mechanisms have yet to be clarified. this study investigated the roles of il-1r <dig> in the thresholds of kindling-induced epileptogenesis and in the kindling-induced sleep disturbances. an il-1r <dig> ko mouse was the ideal model to explore the role of il-1; the difference in parameters can be examined when there is a lack of il- <dig> signaling.

the theory assumed to interpret the discrepant role of il- <dig> in epileptogenesis derives from the variability of il- <dig> concentrations and the complexity of il- <dig> downstream cytokines. therefore, the transgenic il-1r <dig> ko mouse is an excellent model to examine the significance of il- <dig> when its signal in the brain is completely eliminated. much evidence also supports the proconvulsant role of il- <dig> in epilepsy. in rat models, systemic administration of il-1ra reduces seizures induced by hippocampal kindling or pilocarpine  <cit> . in transgenic mice, bicuculline methiodine-induced seizure decreases in il-1ra over-expressed mice, and the seizure threshold in heating-induced febrile seizure is increased in il-1r <dig> −/− mice  <cit> . il- <dig> may enhance seizures by facilitating ltp in the hippocampus; however, it is also suggested that as the dosage is increased, il- <dig> performs the opposite role and suppresses ltp  <cit> . a recently published paper further describes that the pathogenesis and maintenance of temporal lobe epilepsies are attributed to the activation of p2x <dig> receptors by the release of atp during neurodegeneration, which activates the microglia to release il-1β  <cit> . in contrast, the anticonvulsant role of il-1β has also been suggested in bla-kindling rats, as evidenced by the decrease in seizures after icv injection of il-1β  <cit> . our current results indicate no change in the seizure thresholds in kindling epileptogenesis in mice with a lack of il-1r <dig>  these results suggest that il-1r <dig> is not a critical factor in influencing kindling-induced epileptogenesis. however, our other study demonstrated that il-1r <dig> contributes to the epileptogenesis when epilepsy is induced by pentylenetetrazol  .

il-1β is one of the potent somnogenic factors. it’s been reported that nrem sleep during the dark period is reduced in il-1r <dig> ko mice when comparied to the wildtype mice  <cit> . in our results, we found that both nrem and rem sleep were reduced during the light period, rather than during the dark period. il-1β exhibits circadian fluctuation with higher concentrations during the light period and with lower concentrations during the dark period  <cit> . a lack of il- <dig> signaling should affect sleep during the light period, and our results provided the evidence to support the somnogenesis of il- <dig> signaling. the increase of nrem sleep after zt <dig> kindling stimulus in the wildtype mice, but not in the il-1r <dig> ko mice revealing the importance of il- <dig> receptors in epilepsy-induced sleep alterations. during the first 6 h following zt <dig> kindling stimulus , nrem sleep obtained from the wildtype mice increased. these alterations returned to the baseline value on the 2nd day. in transgenic knockout mice, kindling stimulation did not alter nrem sleep during first 6 h.

during neuronal damage, the expression of il-1β and its receptors are increased, and il-1β signaling pathways are activated when encountering pathological damage  <cit> . the activation of il-1β function may facilitate neuronal excitability by modulating long-term potentiation  and inhibitory gaba receptors in hippocampal areas  <cit> . besides affecting synaptic plasticity, the increase of il-1β influences both nrem sleep and rem sleep. administration of il-1β into the cns, or peripheral circulated system, significantly enhances nrem sleep  <cit> . but when the dose of il-1β reaches a pathogenic concentration, the opposite result occurs in which both nrem sleep and rem sleep are suppressed  <cit> . the common phenomenon that nrem sleep increases and rem sleep is suppressed during inflammation in individual is in accordance with the results of il-1β administration  <cit> . this conjecture explains the close link between sleep and the immune system, and it helps interpret our results that nrem sleep increased after zt <dig> kindling in wildtype mice, but not il-1r <dig> ko mice.

the increases of sleep after seizures have also been reported in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rats. administration of pilocarpine enhances and fragments slow wave sleep in the following night and morning, and returns to normal after 24 h  <cit> . quigg et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that deep nrem sleep increases following one kindling stimulus, and lasts even longer after  <dig> times of accumulated kindling stimuli. in our previous study, the seizure occurrence time is considered as a critical factor in determining the ways to alter sleep; kindling stimulation at zt <dig> decreases nrem sleep, whereas zt <dig> kindling stimulation enhances nrem sleep  <cit> . il- <dig> mrna expression increases in the hippocampus and cortex after zt <dig> kindling stimulus and the increase of nrem sleep is blocked by administration of il-1ra  <cit> . nevertheless, our current study demonstrated that a lack of il- <dig> signals in the il-1r <dig> −/− mice failed to express the zt13-induced sleep enhancement. furthermore, different il- <dig> signals may lead to different outcomes between epilepsy and sleep. for example, il- <dig> activates both p <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase  and nuclear factor κb  pathways in astrocytes, but only regulates p <dig> mapk pathways in the hippocampal neurons  <cit> . particularly, a lower dose of il- <dig> phosphorylates src kinase in the hippocampal neurons  <cit> . furthermore, different isoforms of the il- <dig> receptor accessory proteins also mediate different signal pathways  <cit> ; however, the mechanisms need to be further determined. astrocytes and neurons contribute to both epileptogenesis and sleep regulation. different il- <dig> signaling outcomes could explain why il-1r <dig> plays a role in sleep alteration, but not in epileptogenesis in kindled mice.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results demonstrated the essential role of il-1r <dig> in kindling-induced sleep disturbance by using transgenic il-1r <dig> ko mice. epilepsy-induced sleep disturbances were absent in the il-1r <dig> ko mice, indicating the importance of il- <dig> signals. the knockout of il-1r <dig> did not change the seizure thresholds, suggesting that il-1r <dig> signaling is not in involved in the kindling-induced epileptogenesis.
