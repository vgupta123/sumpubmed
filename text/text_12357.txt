BACKGROUND
dna replication involves the coordinated activity of several enzymes and proteins. these enzymes assist with the unwinding, separation, and copying of double stranded dna to produce new identical dna copies  <cit> . dna helicase translocates unidirectionally along one strand of the nucleic acid to facilitate replication initiation. the helicase utilizes atp hydrolysis to separate the dna double helix into individual strands  <cit> . dna primase catalyzes the formation of short rna oligonucleotides used as primers to begin dna synthesis  <cit> . dna polymerase uses the primers and extends the 3' end of the nucleotide chain by adding nucleotides matched to the template strand  <cit> .

individual genes are usually responsible for encoding each replication enzyme activity. however, bacteriophage t <dig> gene  <dig> protein  and similar proteins from t <dig>  p <dig> and other phages  <cit>  encode a single protein with both dna helicase and dna primase domains. t <dig> phage has two forms of gp <dig> protein that are both required for phage genome replication. the longer form has two zinc motifs and has both dna primase and helicase activity while the shorter one retains only dna helicase activity  <cit> .

most eukaryotic organisms have a homologue of the t <dig> gp <dig> protein that has been named twinkle . this protein shares close sequence similarity with the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> primase-helicase protein  <cit> . twinkle is a hexameric dna helicase at the mitochondrial dna replication fork which unwinds sections of double-stranded dna  <cit> . the twinkle homologue lacks dna primase activity in higher eukaryotes but is suggested to have this activity in plasmodium species  <cit>  and arabidopsis thaliana and other plants  <cit> . this protein is assumed to play a key role in mitochondrial dna  replication as it localizes in the mitochondrial nucleoid and matrix. in maize, twinkle has also been found associated with the chloroplast nucleoid  <cit> , suggesting that this protein may function in both mitochondria and chloroplasts.

mutations in twinkle result in mitochondrial-associated diseases in humans  <cit>  and mice  <cit> . in humans, coding region mutations in this gene have been linked with autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia  and are often associated with multiple mtdna deletions, suggesting a role in mtdna replication  <cit> . in mice, twinkle expression reduction by rnai resulted in a rapid drop in mtdna copy number  <cit>  while overexpression of the protein led to increases in mtdna copy number in muscle and heart tissue  <cit> .

when the amino acid sequences of twinkle homologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species are compared, high homology in the conserved walker motifs for the dna helicase domain of the protein has been observed, as summarized in two review papers  <cit> . critical differences were observed in the primase domain of twinkle in some model organisms when compared to the n-terminal end of the t <dig> gp <dig> protein  <cit> . the location of the  primase domain in human twinkle is at the n-terminal portion of the protein, the same as in phage t <dig> gp <dig> and in dnag-like primases in bacteria and phage  <cit> . but unlike t <dig> gp <dig>  the n-terminal domain of human twinkle lacks several motifs required for primer synthesis in t <dig> gp <dig>  thus leading to the prediction that the twinkle n-terminal region is generally inactive in humans and metazoa in general  <cit> . the t <dig> gp <dig> protein contains a beta sheet structure and cysteine residues forming two zinc fingers  <cit>  in motif  <dig>  the n-terminal end of the primase domain of t <dig> gp <dig> contains a zinc finger motif but twinkle in most metazoan species lacks the zinc-binding domain necessary for dna and amino acid binding for polymerization of the primer  <cit> . also, human twinkle does not contain the conserved cysteine residues of the zinc-finger motif critical for dna binding and primase activity  <cit> . the zinc finger motif in the primase domain synthesizes pppac oligonucleotide primers important for the initial step of sequence-specific primer synthesis at the sequence 5′-gtc-3′ <cit> . the twinkle protein from arabidopsis thaliana contains the conserved sequence elements and is predicted to have both dna primase and dna helicase activities.

the arabidopsis genome contains two homologues of the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> protein. the first  shares homology with the conserved motifs of the dna primase and dna helicase domains  <cit> . the coding sequence predicts a protein of about 80 kda, which is larger than the full-length  <dig>  kda t <dig> gp <dig> protein but similar to the sizes of twinkle homologues reported in eukaryotes. the second arabidopsis homologue is truncated, sharing the n-terminal primase domain but entirely lacking the c-terminal helicase domain, with a predicted size of ~38 kda . the truncated gene will be designated as a primase homologue, while the full-length gene will be designated as a twinkle homologue in this paper.

we show here that the arabidopsis t <dig> gp <dig> homologue has both dna primase and dna helicase activities, the first such report from a higher eukaryote. the gene for this protein is highly expressed in rapidly growing plant tissues and is correlated with organelle dna polymerase gene expression.

RESULTS
expression of the arabidopsis protein in e. coli and demonstration of dna primase activity
the full-length cdna for the arabidopsis twinkle gene was obtained and cloned into a bacterial expression vector to produce protein for enzymatic activity assays. the purified protein showed a predominant band of the proper size by gel staining . its identity as the expressed protein was confirmed by western blot analysis using an antibody against a synthetic peptide from the arabidopsis protein sequence . the recombinant protein product is smaller  than the full-length coding region of the twinkle homologue since it lacks the n-terminal organelle targeting sequence. the purified protein was used for an in vitro assay for dna primase activity. gel analysis of the reaction products indicates that the protein is capable of producing rna primers of ~ 9– <dig> bases from a single-stranded dna template . stronger intensity of the primers of  <dig> and  <dig> bases was consistently observed , and are similar in size to products reported for other dna primases  <cit> . the primers were capable of being extended by dna polymerase into high molecular weight dna , which is a fundamental property of a dna primase that generates primers for dna replication. the primer bands are absent in the control lanes , indicating that this activity is not due to bacterial dna primase contamination of the purified recombinant protein. this provides clear evidence for the function of the arabidopsis twinkle homologue as an active dna primase, the first such report in a higher eukaryote.

dna helicase activity of the arabidopsis twinkle homologue protein
the purified recombinant protein was also assayed for dna helicase activity. the results indicate that the protein indeed has atp-dependent dna helicase activity as predicted . the control protein preparation  lacked dna helicase activity in the presence or absence of atp . the activity is similar to the dna unwinding activity we previously detected in soybean mitochondrial extracts  <cit> . the results from the biochemical assays indicate that the arabidopsis twinkle homologue has both dna primase and helicase activities, similar to the phage t <dig> gp <dig> protein.

western blot analysis of arabidopsis twinkle homologue expression
western blot analysis of twinkle protein expression levels in different arabidopsis tissues shows that the protein is most abundant in meristem and young leaf tissue and nearly undetectable in mature leaves . total rosette leaf tissue from plants was collected at weekly intervals and total protein was recovered from each sample for western blot analysis. the results show relatively high levels of the twinkle protein in weeks 1– <dig> of growth, with a subsequent rapid drop in levels until the protein is nearly undetectable after week  <dig> . these results are compatible with those reported from the different tissues . western blot analysis indicated the presence of twinkle in isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts of arabidopsis .

analysis of arabidopsis twinkle homologue expression in different tissues by qrt-pcr
quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr analysis of cdna generated from different tissues indicate that the arabidopsis twinkle gene is expressed at the highest level in the shoot apex , as expected if the twinkle protein plays a role in organelle dna replication in rapidly growing tissues. twinkle is also expressed at relatively high levels in other developing tissues, especially cotyledons and different parts of flowers including sepals, pistils and the inflorescence . interestingly, expression levels of twinkle are very similar to expression levels of dna pol gamma i , a dual-targeted dna polymerase that has been shown to play a role in plant organelle dna replication and repair  <cit> . the expression of dna pol gamma ii is also generally highest in the same tissues that have high twinkle expression . the similar levels of expression of twinkle and the organelle-localized dna polymerases  <cit>  suggest that twinkle may play a role in replication of organelle dna.

analysis of twinkle dna and protein sequences
two separate research groups have reported on the comparison of the amino acid sequences of twinkle homologues from a wide variety of eukaryotic species, and have shown that there is high homology in the conserved walker motifs for the c-terminal dna helicase domain of the arabidopsis protein  <cit> . the human, drosophila and c. elegans twinkle homologues have dna helicase activity but lack dna primase activity  <cit> . upon close examination of the amino acid sequence encoding the primase domain at the n-terminal end of the protein in the plant and animal proteins, some critical differences are apparent. two zinc fingers formed by cysteine residues in motif  <dig> are present in the t <dig> gp <dig> protein  <cit>  and in homologues from most eukaryotes, but the four cysteines that form the zinc fingers are absent in metazoans, including humans  <cit> . analysis of the amino acid sequence alignment of the twinkle homologues against the t <dig> gp <dig> protein shows that only the arabidopsis and other plant twinkle homologues share all highly conserved elements with the t <dig> gp <dig> protein  <cit> . additional important differences are observed in other conserved motifs within the primase region of the protein in humans, drosophila and c. elegans, while the sequences from a number of lower eukaryotes share the conserved elements with t <dig> gp <dig> protein  <cit> . in particular, the human homologue lacks both zinc finger domains in motif  <dig>  and the human and drosophila sequences lack the highly conserved residues found in motif iv and motif v.

the arabidopsis thaliana twinkle protein contains the conserved sequence elements and is predicted to have both dna primase and dna helicase activities  <cit> . while the previous analysis of the amino acid sequences of these proteins identified critical differences at some conserved sites in the primase domain region of the protein in metazoa, including the absence of the cysteine residues needed to form the zinc fingers  <cit> , we wanted to know if these changes were due to minor mutations in the sequence. however, dna sequence analysis indicates that the differences in amino acid sequence of the homologues in human and drosophila are not due to single base changes but are due to more significant alterations in the dna sequence . the base sequence differences that are present in the arabidopsis twinkle primase domain as compared to the t <dig> gp <dig> protein mostly occur in the third position of the codons and do not alter the amino acid sequence.

phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences of twinkle homologues from several plants and other species shows that the arabidopsis and plant homologues are closely clustered and are most similar to the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> protein . the relationship between twinkle proteins is supported by maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of taxonomic samples of twinkle homologues. this suggests that the twinkle homologues from humans and other animals are most distantly related to the t <dig> gp <dig> protein, supporting the observations from direct dna and amino acid sequence alignments.

discussion
twinkle has been shown to be the replicative dna helicase in mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, and mutations that abolish expression of this gene are lethal in animal cells  <cit> . twinkle is a homologue of the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> protein, which has both dna primase and dna helicase activities and contains the highly characterized toprim domain that is conserved in dna primases, topoisomerases and old family nucleases  <cit> . however, until the present work no twinkle homologue from a higher eukaryote has been shown to have dna primase activity. shutt and gray have analyzed the sequence of twinkle homologues from several eukaryote species and have proposed that in addition to being the dna helicase, twinkle may also serve as the mitochondrial dna primase in most eukaryotes except metazoa  <cit> . as far as we know our present report is the first to show that the twinkle homologue in a plant species  has both dna primase and dna helicase activities. other than the truncated primase homologue already mentioned  no other bacterial or phage-type dna primase homologues have been found in the arabidopsis genome sequence.

sequence analysis provides an explanation of why the plant homologue has both activities while the animal homologues lack dna primase activity . the absence of primase activity in human twinkle is likely due to the lack of the zinc finger motifs formed by  <dig> cysteine residues near the n-terminal end of the protein, as well as other amino acid sequence differences at conserved sequences in the primase domain of the protein which have been shown to be responsible for the primase activity   <cit> . sequence variation occurs in other metazoan species, and while some have the zinc fingers, they have differences at other conserved motifs. the arabidopsis homologue, in contrast, retains all conserved motifs  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis further supports these findings, indicating that the plant twinkle homologues are most closely related to the t <dig> gp <dig> protein, while the animal homologues are quite distantly related. these results suggest that the bifunctional t <dig> gp <dig> homologue may be conserved in higher plants.

the arabidopsis twinkle protein may function both in mitochondria and chloroplasts, as this protein has been shown to be dual-targeted to both organelles  <cit> . these reports are based on the analysis of predicted n-terminal targeting sequences of a number of nuclear-encoded arabidopsis proteins fused with the gfp coding region. however, it has been shown that targeting of fusion proteins can be affected by the context of the n-terminal sequence with the gfp sequence  <cit> . a recent report on the maize plastid proteome has shown the presence of twinkle in the chloroplast nucleoid  <cit> .

mitochondrial genomes range widely in size, from about  <dig>  kbp in vertebrates and invertebrates, to 70– <dig> kbp in yeast and 200– <dig> kbp in plants. the replication of animal mtdna has been characterized in great detail, and in the original model each strand of the duplex dna replicates at a different time, with the initial replication primed by a short transcript synthesized by the mitochondrial rna polymerase  <cit> . the second strand replicates only when it becomes single stranded by progression of the first strand, allowing formation of a characteristic structure to facilitate replication initiation of this strand. in yeast and plants, mtdna replication appears to be more complex, and may involve a recombination-dependent replication mechanism  <cit> . in this case dna priming may not be required if invading strands provide the priming function for dna synthesis. however, even in phage systems that replicate by a recombination mechanism a dna primase is still required for priming synthesis at lagging strands during some phases of dna replication  <cit> .

a distinct mtdna primase activity has been reported in some animal and protist cells and mtdna primase activity has been reported in human cells, but no distinct human protein with this activity has yet been identified. it has been suggested that the dna primase in animal cells is tightly associated with the mtdna  polymerase, and is thus difficult to isolate separately  <cit> . in a trypanosome a mtdna primase of 70 kda has been reported  <cit> , while in yeast a mtdna primase of 67 kda has been characterized  <cit> , which are both close to the size of t <dig> gp <dig> and twinkle. our understanding of animal mtdna replication is complicated by reports of strand-coupled bidirectional replication from a single replication origin, which by its nature should require a dna primase to synthesize primers for the lagging strand  <cit> . it is unclear whether a separate mtdna primase is present or required in species  with highly compact mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . recently it has been shown that in vitro, human mitochondrial rna polymerase is responsible for priming lagging strand mtdna synthesis. it may be possible that priming of replication of the small animal mitochondrial genome is provided by short transcripts synthesized by the mitochondrial rna polymerase  <cit> .

a dna primase has been purified and characterized from pea chloroplasts  <cit> , and primers synthesized by that preparation are similar in size to primers synthesized by the purified arabidopsis twinkle homologue. the pea enzyme is larger  than the arabidopsis twinkle homologue, but it was not characterized for dna helicase activity. ctdna replication involves multiple replication origins and bidirectional dna synthesis  <cit> , which would require dna primase activity for lagging strand synthesis.

organelle dna replication appears to be different in plants , which have very large and complex mitochondrial genomes and likely require multiple sites of lagging strand dna synthesis. the role of recombination-mediated replication  <cit>  may reduce the need for primase-synthesized primers for organelle dna replication, as an invading dna strand could provide the 3′ ends for dna synthesis. however, even in this case it is likely that organelle dna primase is required in plants. bacteriophage t <dig> replicates by multiple mechanisms, including recombination-dependent replication, and requires a dna primase. the observations that the arabidopsis twinkle protein is expressed at highest levels in the shoot apex and other developing tissues including young leaves provides strong support for a role of the twinkle homologue in plant organelle dna replication, similar to its role in other species  <cit> .

mutations in human twinkle have been shown to lead to a drastic reduction in mtdna copy number and disease  <cit> . rnai-mediated reduction of twinkle expression in cultured human cells was found to lead to a rapid drop in mtdna copy number, while overexpression of twinkle in mouse tissue was associated with an increase in mtdna copy number  <cit> . in each of these cases the effect has been associated with the dna helicase activity of the protein. we showed that this single protein from arabidopsis has both dna primase and dna helicase activities in vitro, the same activity as the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> protein.

CONCLUSIONS
the arabidopsis homologue of the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> protein has been shown to have both dna primase and dna helicase activities similar to the phage protein. it is expressed at highest levels in actively growing tissues, suggesting that it could play a role in organelle dna replication. two dna polymerases have been identified in plants, and both have been reported to be dual targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit> . it is likely that this arabidopsis phage t <dig> gp <dig> homologue functions along with one or both of these dna polymerases to accomplish organelle dna replication. even if the mtdna replicates by a recombination-dependent mechanism as suggested by some  <cit> , dna priming may be required for lagging-strand dna replication. this arabidopsis protein may also play a role in control of plant mtdna  copy number as observed in animals  <cit> , but this determination will require additional experiments, which will be the subject of future work in our lab.
