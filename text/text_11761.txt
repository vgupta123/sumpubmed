BACKGROUND
leukocyte infiltration into inflammatory sites is critical for the initiation and progression of a variety of inflammatory disorders and is controlled via the activation and signaling of specific cell-surface chemoattractant receptors by their cognate protein ligands, termed chemokines. chemokines, which are produced by a number of cell types at sites of inflammation, mediate the firm adhesion of leukocytes to activated endothelial cells, their subsequent transmigration and extravasation into the inflamed tissue, and possibly several cellular signaling pathways involved in cell activation and differentiation  <cit> .

cxcr <dig> is a seven-transmembrane g-protein coupled chemokine receptor which has been demonstrated to play an important role in a variety of inflammatory and immunological responses. cxcr <dig> receptor is predominantly expressed on activated t helper  <dig>  cells. its ligands, cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig>  are expressed by endothelial cells, epithelial cells and infiltrating leukocytes following stimulation by interferon -γ or type i ifns and their expression is synergistically enhanced by the key pro-inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor -α  <cit> .

the importance of cxcr <dig> in leukocyte recruitment was first demonstrated in the cxcr <dig> knockout mouse, where the rejection of a cardiac allograft was significantly delayed compared to matched wild type animals, and where treatment of the cxcr3-deficient host with the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine resulted in permanent allograft engraftment  <cit> . transplant rejection is caused by infiltration, activation and expansion of host leukocytes in the grafted organ resulting in destruction of the donor tissue. the marked upregulation of cxcr <dig> ligand expression and the predominant expression of cxcr <dig> on infiltrating t cells during allograft rejection in human and in animal models indicate a critical role for cxcr3-dependent t cell recruitment in transplant rejection  <cit> . similarly, the upregulation of cxcr <dig> ligands and the increased number of cxcr3+ lymphocytes documented in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis   <cit> , multiple sclerosis   <cit>  and psoriasis  <cit>  indicates the potential importance of cxcr3-mediated leukocyte recruitment in the pathology of these conditions, and suggests the potential utility of the selective cxcr <dig> antagonist in the treatment and amelioration of these disorders.

to date, many different classes of small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonists have been discovered  <cit> , and it was reported that cxcr <dig> antagonism reduced inflammation and cartilage damage in mouse and rat models of collagen-induced arthritis , attenuated atherosclerotic plaque formation, prolonged allograft survival, and inhibited lung metastasis  <cit> . in this report, we described the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterizations of a novel and potent cxcr <dig> antagonist sch  <dig>   <cit> . so far, sch  <dig> is reported to have the highest affinity of  <dig>  nm to human cxcr <dig> receptor. sch  <dig> inhibits cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> binding and human activated t cell chemotaxis with nanomolar potency. in vivo, sch  <dig> shows significant efficacy in mouse cia and rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  model. more importantly, we show that combination of ifn-β therapy and cxcr <dig> inhibition has an additive effect on delaying disease onset and attenuating disease severity in the mouse eae model. furthermore, sch  <dig> delays graft rejection and in combination with cyclosporine, permits permanent engraftment in the rat cardiac allograft transplant model. these results demonstrate that sch  <dig> may offer a tool to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of cxcr <dig> antagonism in chronic inflammatory disease and preventing allograft rejection.

radioligand binding assays
a scintillation proximity assay was used for radioligand competition binding assays as described previously  <cit>  with some modifications. for each assay point,  <dig> µg of membrane was preincubated for  <dig> hr with  <dig> µg wheat germ agglutinin  coated spa beads  in the binding buffer  at room temperature. the beads were spun down, resuspended in the binding buffer and transferred to a 96-well isoplate . the indicated concentrations of 125i-hcxcl <dig>  125i-hcxcl <dig> or 35s-sch  <dig> with a series of titrations of sch  <dig> were added to start the reaction. after indicated reaction times at room temperature, the amount of radioactivity bound to the spa beads was determined with a wallac  <dig> microbeta counter .

human activated t cell chemotaxis assays
the preparation of human activated t cells was performed as described previously  <cit> . human peripheral blood lymphocytes were prepared by ficoll-hypaque centrifugation, depleted of monocytes, and stimulated for  <dig> days with  <dig> µg/ml pha  and  <dig> u/ml il- <dig>  in rpmi  <dig> supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> mm l-glutamine,  <dig> µg/ml streptomycin,  <dig> u/ml penecillin, 1% non-essential amino acids and  <dig> mm hepes. following stimulation, peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured in above media containing 5% conditioned media  for up to  <dig> days.

human activated t cell chemotaxis assays were performed using 96-well chemotx® microplates  with a  <dig> µm filter as per manufacturers' instructions. activated t cells were washed with rpmi medium twice, and then resuspended in the medium containing 20% fbs.  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/reaction were mixed with indicated concentrations of the compound and placed on the filter. the compound and chemokines were mixed and placed in the bottom well of the chemotx system. after  <dig>  hours incubation at 37°c/5% co <dig>  the cells were scraped off and the plate system was centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm. the filter screen was then removed and the chemotx plate was inverted into a  <dig> well plate  with a funnel plate. the plate system was centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> rpm. the volume in the wells was brought to  <dig> μl with assay buffer and the plates were rested for approximately  <dig> minutes at room temperature. the number of migrated cells was measured using the cell titer glo luminescent assay from promega  as per vendor's instructions. chemotaxis is expressed as a chemotactic index, which is a ratio versus the one without chemokines .

mouse collagen-induced arthritis
murine collagen-induced arthritis  was established as previously described  <cit> . briefly, 12-week-old male b <dig> riii mice  were immunized intradermally at five sites with bovine type ii collagen  emulsified with an equal volume of complete freund's adjuvant . cfa was comprised of a mixture of incomplete freund's adjuvant  and heat-killed, freeze-dried mycobacteria tuberculosis . each mouse received  <dig> µg/ml bovine type ii collagen and  <dig>  mg/ml complete freund's adjuvant. mice were boosted intraperitoneally with  <dig> µg of bovine type ii collagen on day  <dig>  disease progression was monitored by a standardized visual scoring system with a scale from  <dig> to  <dig> reflecting the degree of swelling/redness of each paw  and the number of paws  involved per individual animal.

histopathological analysis
after euthanasia, front and hind paws of the animals were dissected and fixed by immersion in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin before decalcification. following decalcification with cal-rite , formalin fixed tissues were processed and sectioned at 5µm. paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin . the criteria of histopathological analysis was carried out as described  <cit> . the changes in joint structures, including cartilage destruction, bone erosion/remodelling and pannus formation were scored as follows:  <dig> = normal,  <dig> = minimal,  <dig> = mild,  <dig> = moderate,  <dig> = marked,  <dig> = severe. a grade of  <dig>  was also added to address full-thickness cartilage breach. cellular infiltrates and inflammation in animal joints were scored as the following:  <dig> = normal,  <dig> = minimal,  <dig> = mild,  <dig> = moderate,  <dig> = marked.

mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
female c57bl/ <dig> mice were purchased from jackson laboratory . for immunization,  <dig> μg mog35- <dig> peptide prepared by princeton biomolecules  and  <dig> μg killed mycobacterium tuberculosis  were mixed in cfa  and injected s.c. in two 50-μl injections over the flanks on day  <dig>  also,  <dig> ng of pertussis toxin  was injected i.v. on days  <dig> and  <dig>  the compound was administered orally twice daily. dosing with the compound started at day  <dig>   <dig> h prior to mog35- <dig> immunization . mice were monitored daily and assessed for clinical signs of disease in a blinded fashion according to the following criteria:  <dig>  no signs of disease;  <dig>  tail paralysis;  <dig>  limp tail and hind limb weakness;  <dig>  hind limb paralysis;  <dig>  hind limb plus forelimb paralysis; and  <dig>  moribund or dead. cumulative clinical scores were calculated by adding daily scores from the day of immunization until the end of the experiment. mean clinical scores at separate days and mean maximal scores were calculated by adding the scores of individual mice and dividing with the number of mice in each group, including mice not developing signs of eae. all animals were used in accordance with protocols and guidelines established by institute's animal care and use committee.

rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
male lewis rats challenged by injection of  <dig> µl  of a guinea pig spinal cord homogenate in cfa into one footpad. the animals were treated starting at day  <dig> and oral dosing continued throughout the 3-week disease course, with varying amounts of sch  <dig> in  <dig> % methylcellulose  p.o. animals were scored for disease severity:  <dig>  no clinical signs;  <dig>  flaccid tail;  <dig>  hind limb weakness;  <dig>  complete hind limb paralysis;  <dig>  complete hind limb paralysis, forelimb weakness or paralysis;  <dig>  death.

statistical analysis
for cia and eae models, unpaired t-tests were performed using graphpad instat version  <dig> . <dig> for windows  <dig>  graphpad software, san diego california usa . statistical significance was evaluated by comparing the vehicle-treated group with the experimental group using unpaired t-test. differences were considered significant when p values were < <dig> .

cardiac transplantation in rats
cardiac graft of aci  rats was heterotopically transplanted into the abdominal cavity of lewis  recipients employing a microvascular surgical technique as described  <cit> . the grafts were monitored daily by abdominal palpation, and the complete cessation of heart contraction was defined as graft rejection. sch  <dig> or  <dig> % methylcellulose  was orally administered at the indicated dose  twice a day, starting on the day before transplantation until the day of graft rejection. to test whether sch  <dig> enhanced the effect of conventional immunosuppressive reagent, the recipients were received treatment with subtherapeutic dose of csa for one week combined with treatment with sch  <dig>  graft survival was analyzed using the log-rank test. the parametric data were analyzed by student t test  using graphpad instat version  <dig> . <dig> for windows  <dig>  graphpad software, san diego california usa . p <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
to identify cxcr <dig> antagonists, we have generated a mouse pro-b cell line ba/f <dig> stably expressing a high level of human cxcr <dig> receptor. the membranes were prepared for establishing a sensitive binding assay using hcxcl <dig> based on the scintillation proximity assay  <cit> . from high throughput screening of small molecule compound libraries, several lead compounds were discovered  <cit> . through the optimization of the lead compound, we have found sch  <dig>   <cit>  to be a selective and potent cxcr <dig> antagonist with a good pk for in vivo studies. its structure is shown in figure  <dig> 

affinity of sch  <dig> for cxcr <dig> receptor
the affinity of sch  <dig> binding to human cxcr <dig> receptor was determined by competition binding analysis using 35s radiolabeled sch  <dig>  as a competitive tracer. in multiple experiments, the affinity constant  of sch  <dig> binding to human cxcr <dig> receptor was determined to be  <dig>  nm .

inhibition of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> binding to cxcr <dig> receptor
competition of human cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> binding to human cxcr <dig> by sch  <dig> was determined at various concentrations of hcxcl <dig> and hcxcl <dig> around the kd  for the receptor. the ic <dig> of sch  <dig> is constant  and independent of the input concentrations of either hcxcl <dig>  or hcxcl <dig>  , respectively. these results indicate that sch  <dig> is a non-competitive antagonist of both cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> binding to cxcr <dig>  suggesting that sch  <dig> binds to cxcr <dig> receptor at an allosteric site and change its conformation which prevents the binding of both cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> 

it is important to investigate species specificity of sch  <dig> to design in vivo preclinical studies. as shown in table  <dig>  sch  <dig> has strong cross-species activities with ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm in inhibiting the binding of hcxcl <dig> to cxcr <dig> of monkey, dog, mouse and rat origin, respectively.

ic <dig> 
competition binding assays using hcxcl <dig> were carried out as described in methods with membranes prepared from ba/f <dig> cells expressing human, monkey, dog, mouse and rat cxcr <dig> receptors.

functional inhibition of cxcr3-mediated chemotaxis
the functional activity of sch  <dig> was investigated by cxcr3-mediated chemotaxis assays using human activated t cells. sch  <dig> at fixed concentrations of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> nm was evaluated for its ability to inhibit human activated t cell chemotaxis induced by various concentrations of the three cxcr <dig> ligands cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> and the ccr <dig> ligand ccl <dig> . sch  <dig> at  <dig> nm inhibited t cell chemotaxis induced by all three cxcr <dig> ligands about 90% . in contrast, sch  <dig> did not affect t cell chemotaxis induced by the ccr <dig> ligand ccl <dig>  furthermore, sch  <dig> inhibited t cell chemotaxis induced by the three cxcr <dig> ligand among all tested ligand concentrations in an insurmountable manner, suggesting that sch  <dig> is a non-competitive antagonist, as has been characterized in the competition binding analyses . it is critical to have a nonocompetitive antagonist which will inhibit binding of multiple endogenous ligands and inhibit its function  at any possible high local concentration of the ligand in the disease stage.

biochemical selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties
sch  <dig> was tested at concentrations of 1- <dig> μm against a panel of  <dig> gpcr binding assays. most of the assays were not affected by sch  <dig> . these results indicate that sch  <dig> is a highly selective antagonist of cxcr <dig>  in addition, sch  <dig> has a favourable pharmacokinetic profile in rodents. figure  <dig> shows the plasma concentrations of sch  <dig> in lewis rat and c57bl/ <dig> mouse over  <dig> hr post-dose. the auc  is  <dig>  μm.hr in lewis rat @  <dig> mg/kg  and is  <dig>  μm.hr in c57bl/ <dig> mouse @  <dig> mpk. therefore, sch  <dig> is suitable for in vivo preclinical studies.

sch  <dig> was tested at the indicated concentrations in a variety of gpcr assays according to established protocols.

administration of sch  <dig> attenuates disease in mouse collagen-induced arthritis and protects joint structure
collagen-induced arthritis  was induced in male b <dig> riii mice by immunization with bovine collagen type ii  which resulted in the development of poly-arthritis in the paw. sixteen days later which was  <dig> days prior to receiving a bc ii boost ; mice were randomized into treatment groups with approximately 10% of the animals in each group having developed at least one swollen paw. oral twice daily treatment with sch  <dig> was initiated at this time  and continued through day  <dig>  with a bc ii antigen boost on day  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that sch  <dig> attenuated disease development in a dose-dependent fashion, with significant reduction of the disease score evident at  <dig> mpk on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while it protected significantly on days  <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> mpk. sch  <dig> administration at  <dig> mpk had no statistically significant effect on disease severity.

paws collected on day  <dig> from the vehicle and  <dig> mpk sch  <dig> groups of two independent experiments were analyzed by histopathology. statistical analysis of the combined histopathology scores demonstrated that in animals treated with  <dig> mpk sch  <dig>  both leukocyte infiltration into the joint and the structural damage to the bone and cartilage was significantly attenuated . this data demonstrates that therapeutic treatment with a cxcr <dig> antagonist significantly impairs the development of disease in an animal model of rheumatoid arthritis, and supports the clinical development of sch  <dig> in this disease.

administration of sch  <dig> reduces disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis  is an animal model for human ms and development of disease is dependent on t cell infiltration into the cns. in the murine model of eae, sch  <dig> was tested in combination with interferon-β , a current first-line therapeutic for the amelioration of relapsing-remitting ms. c57bl/ <dig> mice were primed by intravenous injection of pertussis toxin on day  <dig> and day  <dig>  eae was induced on day  <dig> by subcutaneous injection of the myelin peptide mog 35- <dig> emulsified in cfa in the back of primed mice. disease progression was monitored by a scoring system as described in methods. ifn-β administered at  <dig> ng by daily intramuscular injection significantly delayed disease onset and attenuated disease severity at peak of disease compared to vehicle treated animals . similarly, sch  <dig> at  <dig> mpk orally twice daily delayed disease onset and attenuated disease severity on days  <dig> and  <dig> . combination treatment with sch  <dig> and ifn-β had a significant additive effect in delaying disease onset and attenuating disease severity compared to treatment with either sch  <dig> or ifn-β alone  suggesting that a cxcr <dig> antagonist may offer substantial 'add-on' efficacy onto existing ifn-β therapy and further delay the occurrence of relapses in ms patients. in addition, eae was induced in lewis rats by subcutaneous injections of guinea pig spinal cord emulsified in cfa into one hind paw. sch  <dig> reduced the severity of the disease in a dose-dependent manner as well .

inhibition of cxcr <dig> delays graft rejection and in combination with cyclosporine, permits permanent engraftment
published data demonstrated that in the cxcr <dig> knockout mouse rejection of cardiac allografts was significantly delayed  <cit> . based on this observation sch  <dig> was tested at various doses by twice daily oral administration in a rat cardiac allograft model starting at the day of transplantation. sch  <dig> significantly increased the mean survival time of the graft at  <dig> mpk  when compared to the vehicle control , and further delayed graft rejection at a dose of  <dig> mpk  . cyclosporine is the current gold standard in organ transplant therapies in human. a cyclosporine dose response was conducted earlier in a rat cardiac allograft model and  <dig>  mpk of cyclosporine is a low and suboptimal dose . figure  <dig> shows that cyclosporine significantly delayed graft rejection in the rat model at a daily suboptimal dose of  <dig>  mpk and permitted the permanent engraftment of approximately 40% of the grafts . in combination with  <dig>  mpk cyclosporine a suboptimal dose of  <dig> mpk sch  <dig> twice daily increased the rate of permanent engraftment to 100% . these data indicate that the selective inhibition of cxcr <dig> would have a beneficial effect on allograft survival and may offer the possibility of reducing the dose of cyclosporine used in patients, thereby limiting the potential for serious side effects.

discussion
the cxcr <dig> receptor and its three interferon-inducible ligands  have been implicated in several th1-mediated inflammatory diseases. recently, the efficacy of the anti-ip- <dig> antibody mdx- <dig> reported in a phase  <dig> clinical trial for ra  <cit>  reinforced the crucial role of the cxcl10-cxcr <dig> axis in this disease, and the therapeutic potential of small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonists  <cit> . so far, only one of the cxcr <dig> antagonists, amg <dig> , progressed to phase ii clinical trials but has been halted because of lack of efficacy. since this may have been due to variability in drug exposure, it is clear that this failure is not a misrepresentation of cxcr <dig> as a drug target. in this regard, sch  <dig> is a small molecule non-competitive cxcr <dig> antagonist with much higher affinity than amg <dig> and therefore may have better chance to achieve the in vivo efficacy.

in the mouse cia model, sch  <dig> is efficacious in reducing disease development by attenuating leukocyte infiltration into the joint and the structural damage to the bone and cartilage. it is of interest to note that sch  <dig> demonstrated efficacy even though dosing was started after the disease process was initiated and when mice had already started to show signs of paw swelling. it was reported that t <dig> reduced inflammation and cartilage damage in mouse and rat models of cia  <cit> . in rat adjuvant arthritis, blockade of cxcr <dig> by anti-cxcr <dig> mab significantly inhibits t cell infiltration of arthritic joints and reduces the severity of arthritis  <cit> . all these data directly demonstrate an important role of cxcr <dig> in the development of arthritis and cxcr <dig> blockade reduces the disease severity in the arthritis. it is likely that small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonists may achieve the efficacy of the anti-ip- <dig> antibody mdx- <dig> reported in a phase  <dig> clinical trial for ra.

the available functional data for the role of cxcr <dig> and its ligands in eae are contradictory. different investigators have reported conflicting results when using ip-10-/- mice, anti-ip- <dig> antibody, anti-sense rna and vaccines  <cit> . the recent results from cxcr3-/- mice show that cxcr <dig> is not required for the recruitment of immune cells to the cns in mog-eae. the work by liu et al.  <cit>  showed exacerbation of eae disease in cxcr3-/- mice and with neutralizing anti-cxcr <dig> abs. it indicates that the exacerbation in the cxcr3-/- mice correlates with enhanced effector t cell proliferation and reduced peripheral and cns expression of ifn-γ, but with no impact on leukocyte migration to cns. a subsequent study by muller et al.  <cit>  showed that cxcr3-/- mice had more severe chronic disease with increased demyelination and axonal damage, although the number of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells infiltrating the cns were similar in cxcr3-/- and wild type mice. in contrast to mog-eae, cxcr <dig> appears to promote the lymphocyte accumulation inside the cns in some virus-induced demyelinating disease models  <cit> . this may point to disease-specific functions of cxcr <dig> and its ligands, which can vary depending on the nature of the pathogenic insult. these varied results probably reflect the complex and perhaps divergent roles for the chemokine system in the pathogenesis of eae and virus-induced neuroinflammatory diseases. recently, a nonspecific small molecule antagonist of ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and cxcr <dig>  was reported to reduce incidence and severity of eae by decreasing migration of inflammatory cells into the cns  <cit> . our study is the first report that a specific small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist sch  <dig> consistently inhibits both mouse and rat eae clinical disease with no evidence of exacerbation. furthermore, combination of ifn-β therapy and cxcr <dig> inhibition has an additive effect on delaying disease onset and attenuating disease severity in the mouse eae model. at least for small molecule antagonists including sch  <dig>  the beneficial effect of cxcr <dig> blockade has been observed in eae. maybe studies using cxcr3-/- mice and neutralizing anti-cxcr <dig> abs offer some hints as to other possible function of cxcr <dig> receptor and its ligands. beyond leukocyte recruitment, cxcr <dig> may modulate t cell ifn-γ production, regulation between th <dig> vs. th <dig> cells, or control t cells at the perivascular space in the cns. it is not unlikely that a small molecule antagonist, a neutralizing antibody or a genetic deletion can perturb a receptor's activity in different ways, leading to different conclusion about the protein's biological function.

the role of cxcr <dig> in leukocyte recruitment was first demonstrated in the cxcr <dig> knockout mouse in year  <dig>  where the rejection of a cardiac allograft was significantly delayed, and resulted in permanent allograft engraftment with cyclosporine  <cit> . in addition, lack of cxcl <dig> in the graft led to prolonged allograft survival  <cit> . however, two recent studies published in  <dig>  <cit>  questioned the importance of cxcr <dig> in allograft rejection and found moderate to little increase in graft survival using cxcr3-/- mice or small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist mrl- <dig> and anti-cxcr <dig> antibody targeting in human cxcr <dig> knock-in mice. these two studies conclude that cxcr <dig> is not essential for leukocyte recruitment in the cardiac allograft rejection. in contrast, uppaluri et al.  <cit>  demonstrates that a cxcr <dig> blocking antibody significantly prolonged both cardiac and islet allograft survival, and induced long-term graft survival greater than  <dig> days when combined with rapamycin. in  <dig>  one study shows that tak- <dig> attenuates cardiac allograft vasculopathy in part by reducing ccr5+ and cxcr3+ t lymphocyte subset infiltration into the graft  <cit> . the other study by rosenblum et al.  <cit>  shows that small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist amg <dig> prolongs allograft survival; however, it does not inhibit leukocyte recruitment into the graft. the difference in the contribution of cxcr <dig> to mouse allograft rejection observed in similar models in different laboratories can not be explained by current data sets and additional experiments are required to clarify these conflicting results.

in the rat cardiac allograft transplant model, a small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist tlrk-a was reported to prolong graft survival, but was active only in combination with cyclosporine  <cit> . however, another small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist nibr <dig> did not prolong graft survival  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrate that sch  <dig> delays graft rejection and in combination with cyclosporine, permits permanent engraftment in the rat cardiac allograft transplant model.

in summary, our study demonstrates that administration of sch  <dig> attenuates disease in mouse cia, rat and mouse eae, and rat cardiac allograft rejection. combination of ifn-β therapy and sch  <dig> has an additive effect in the mouse eae model. furthermore, in combination with cyclosporine, sch  <dig> permits permanent engraftment in the rat cardiac allograft transplant model.

the findings from our study and others indicate that targeting the cxcr <dig> receptor by small molecule antagonists and antibodies can be a promising approach to ra. since the results from cxcr <dig> inhibition in eae and allograft rejection remains contradictory, we need to better understand the roles of the chemokine system operating in the pathogenesis of eae and allograft rejection that truly reflects the molecular mechanism in human diseases and enhance the chance of success in human clinical trials.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we describe the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterizations of a novel and potent small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist, sch  <dig>  it binds to human cxcr <dig> with an affinity of  <dig>  nm, which is the most potent small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonist reported so far. competition binding studies show that sch  <dig> is able to displace radiolabeled cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> from human cxcr <dig> with high affinity  in a non-competitive manner. in addition, sch  <dig> has strong cross-species activity with ic <dig> of  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm,  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm for monkey, mouse, rat and dog cxcr <dig> receptor, respectively. sch  <dig> potently and specifically inhibits cxcr3-mediated chemotaxis in human activated t cells with ic <dig> about  <dig> nm. sch  <dig> has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in rodents. we utilized multiple preclinical disease models relevant to human rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, transplantation to assess in vivo efficacy of sch  <dig>  we demonstrate that sch  <dig> attenuates the disease development in mouse collagen-induced arthritis model by decreasing both leukocyte infiltration into the joint and the structural damage to the bone and cartilage. sch  <dig> also significantly reduces disease severity in rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, and in combination with ifn-β in mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. furthermore, sch  <dig> alone achieves dose-dependent prolongation of rat cardiac allograft survival. most significantly, sch  <dig> in combination with cyclosporine supports permanent engraftment. taken together, the results show that therapy with potent small molecule cxcr <dig> antagonists may serve as a new strategy for treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and to prevent transplant rejection.
