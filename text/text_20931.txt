BACKGROUND
the thymus is a central lymphoid organ, in which bone marrow-derived t cell precursors undergo a complex process of maturation, eventually leading to the migration of positively selected thymocytes to the t-dependent areas of peripheral lymphoid organs. this differentiation process involves sequential expression of a variety of membrane proteins and rearrangements in t-cell receptor genes. most potentially self-reactive thymocytes are negatively selected by clonal deletion, whereas some are rescued from death through positive selection, eventually yielding the vast majority of the t-cell repertoire  <cit> . in both positive and negative selection events, cell-cell adhesion between developing thymocytes and non-lymphoid microenvironmental cells of the organ is mandatory  <cit> .

the thymic microenvironment which is tridimensional network composed of non-lymphoid cells including thymic epithelial cells  – the most conspicuous cellular elements – dendritic cells, macrophages and, to a lesser extent fibroblasts, as well as extracellular matrix   <cit> . developing thymocytes interact with thymic microenvironment in a defined spatial order. this is evident from the different localization of the individual stages of thymocyte development. the most immature, cd4-cd8- double negative  thymocytes are found beneath the subcapsular epithelium of the thymic lobules, while the more mature, cd4+cd8+ double positive  stages can be detected throughout the cortical region. the more differentiated cd4+ or cd8+ single positive  thymocytes are mainly found in the medulla  <cit> . there is evidence that extracellular matrix  molecules play a fundamental role in localizing the different thymocyte stages in the thymus  <cit> . interestingly, it is possible that supramolecular ecm arrangements function as a conveyor belt, allowing an ordered migration of thymocytes within the organ  <cit> .

fibronectin  is one ecm ligand constitutively expressed in all mammalian thymuses so far analyzed, including mice and humans  <cit> . particularly in the human thymus both fn isoforms were detected within the thymic lobules  <cit> . two integrin-type fibronectin specific receptors are consistently expressed by developing thymocytes: vla- <dig> , which recognizes the rgd-containing fibronectin binding site and vla- <dig>  that identify the cs <dig> segment of fibronectin, derived by alternative splicing of the corresponding pre-mrna  <cit> . vla- <dig> is expressed on almost all human thymocytes . its membrane expression is higher on dn thymocytes, decreases slightly on dp cells, and is 10-fold lower on sp cells. although vla- <dig> is also expressed by the majority of thymocytes , its expression pattern is distinct from that α4β1: it is expressed at high levels on dn cells, decreases on dp cells, but it is up-regulated on mature single positive cells  <cit> .

thymic microenvironmental cells express integrin-type fibronectin receptors  <cit> . in cultured human tec, both vla- <dig> and vla- <dig> were detected  <cit> . in the mouse model, we demonstrated that both epithelial and non-epithelial phagocytic cells of the thymic microenvironment express vla- <dig> at high densities on their membranes  <cit> . in all cases, the interaction between α5β <dig> and fn is essential for thymocyte adhesion to microenvironmental cells, since heterocellular adhesion could be significantly disrupted by using anti-vla- <dig> antibody applied to growing tec prior to co-culturing with thymocytes  <cit> .

herein, we further studied the role of integrin α <dig> subunit in human thymocyte and thymic epithelial cell interactions, through the silencing of the gene coding for cd49e, α <dig> integrin subunit of vla- <dig>  in thymic epithelial cells by rna interference , an approach that has emerged as a convenient and effective tool for loss-of-function studies. using this strategy, we looked for differential gene expression in silenced cells using cdna microarrays. cd49e gene silencing yielded a modulation of more than  <dig> genes, including adhesion molecules and some genes related to integrin pathway. following transfection of cultured tec with cd49e specific rnai, we also found that the reduction in vla- <dig> density on tec membrane significantly decreased thymocyte adhesion. conjointly, our data reinforce the role of vla- <dig> in tec/thymocyte interactions in the process of human thymocyte differentiation.

RESULTS
inhibition of cd49e expression by sirna in human thymic epithelial cells
we first defined if we could effectively silence cd49e mrna and the corresponding protein using small interference rna  in human tec preparations, known to constitutively express α5β <dig> as well as α4β <dig> fibronectin receptors  <cit> . for that, we transfected into the human tec line a cd49e-sirna that is complementary to the cd49e gene or a control scrambled sirna, both conjugated to alexa- <dig> . as assessed after  <dig> hours of transfection in a dose curve by flow cytometry, tecs exhibited 80% of alexa- <dig> expression compared to labeling seen in untransfected cells in  <dig> nm of sirna . the down-regulation of cd49e mrna induced by sirna was determined using real-time quantitative pcr. the total level of cd49e mrna could be reduced as much as 100% on cd49e-sirna compared to control-sirna cells,  <dig> hours following transfection , although the reduction degree could vary from experiment to experiment, in a range between  <dig> to 100% of mrna silencing. to determine whether expression of the cd49e integrin subunit was suppressed on the cell surface of tec line following transfection with cd49e-sirna cells were stained with a monoclonal cd49e-specific antibody conjugated to phycoeritrin. a distinct subpopulation with reduced levels of surface cd49e was clearly resolved using flow cytometry in the cd49e-sirna sample but not in the control sample . the same result was found by immunofluorescence, transfected cells were stained with the same cd49e-antibody used in flow cytometry  <dig> hours following transfection. cd49e-sirna treated cells showed reduction of α <dig> integrin subunit compared to control sirna transfected cells .

a time-course evaluation revealed that cd49e-sirna-triggered down-regulation of membrane cd49e was transient with most efficient silencing at 72h post-transfection . reduced membrane levels of cd49e were not detected earlier than 48h indicating that cd49e specific sirna treatment requires days to effectively suppress protein expression.

specificity of sirna-mediated silencing
we next investigated whether the surface expression of other integrin-type fibronectin receptor was altered in cd49e-sirna transfected cells. for that, we analyzed the cell surface expression of cd49d that together with cd <dig> form the integrin α4β <dig> . three days following transfection, cells were labeled with anti-cd49d and anti-cd49e monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry. a decrease on the surface expression of cd49e receptor was confirmed, but no significant differences in the cell surface expression of cd49d was observed . of note, we also analyzed the gene expression of integrin β <dig> subunit  by real-time quantitative pcr and there was no reduction of gene expression levels when compared scramble-sirna versus cd49e-sirna transfected cells . also, fibronectin expression, at both mrna and protein levels, was not significantly changed .

conjointly, these data tell us that cd49e-sirna specifically repress the expression of the corresponding gene, but does not interfere with the expression of its natural ligand, fibronectin, neither to the expression of the other integrin-type fibronectin receptor, vla- <dig> 

nevertheless, real-time quantitative pcr analysis revealed that members of other adhesion receptor gene families were modulated. this was the case for neuronal cell adhesion molecule, as well as neuropilin- <dig> and its corresponding signaling transducer plexin a <dig>  interestingly, gene expression of another natural neuropilin ligand, vegf, was also down-regulated in cd49e-sirna treated tec, as compared to control scramble-sirna treatment .

finally, we found that gene expression of one member of the integrin signaling cascade, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase , was down-regulated in cd49e-sirna treated tec.

gene expression profile in cd49e rna silenced human tec
the above findings, together with previous data showing that blockade of cd49e with a specific antibody directly stimulated the production of both tgf-β  and pai- <dig>  in human mesangial cells  <cit> , led us to further explore the effect of cd49e gene silencing in cultured tec, using dna microarray strategy. the relative abundance of each transcript was analyzed  <dig> hours after transfection. three independent experiments were performed and the efficiency of cd49e depletion was confirmed by real-time quantitative pcr . the microarray analysis identified  <dig> genes differentially expressed following knockdown of the cd49e gene, when compared with tec cultures treated with scramble-sirna. among these,  <dig> genes were down-regulated and  <dig> genes were up-regulated .

the differential expressed genes were classified in categories according to biological function . among the  <dig> down-regulated genes, 6% corresponded to those reported above, concerning cell adhesion molecules. genes related to signal transduction and transcription factors represented 9% and 6% of the down-regulated genes, whereas 6% were related to protein metabolism, and 5% to intracellular transport. nevertheless, 60% of the down-regulated genes are still not annotated.

as shown in figure  <dig>  among the  <dig> up-regulated genes, 44% are not yet annotated, and 23% belong to the functional category of signal transduction. some of these genes, like phospholipase cγ <dig> , cysteine-rich pak <dig> inhibitor , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog b <dig>  and shc  transforming protein  <dig> , are involved in the integrin signaling pathway, thus suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms taking place within the integrin-related circuitry.

rnai mediated loss of cd49e expression leads to a decrease in tec/ thymocyte adhesion
in a last set of experiments, we addressed the functional consequences of cd49e-sirna-triggered down-regulation of cd49e expression in tec, upon their ability to interact with developing thymocytes. for this purpose, we evaluated thymocyte adhesion in tec transfected with cd49e-sirna versus untreated or scramble-sirna treated. thus, cd49e-sirna transfected cells had decreased number of adhered thymocytes compared to cells transfected with scramble-sirna or untreated cells .

it is noteworthy that, although a precise quantitative analysis was not done, we did not notice any clear-cut change in tec growth, with cultures being rather similar among the various groups.

we then evaluated whether adhesion blockade targeted preferentially a given cd4/cd8-defined thymocyte subset . this was not the case, since all immature and mature subsets were similarly affected after adhesion in cd49e-sirna, when compared to scramble-sirna or untreated cells.

taken together, our observations confirm the importance of the fibronectin receptor vla- <dig> in tec/thymocyte adhesion, affecting interactions with both immature and mature thymocytes.

discussion
during t cell development, bone marrow-derived precursors migrate towards the thymus. developing thymocytes travel within the cortex and medulla through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contacts and also in response to soluble secretory moieties such as cytokines and chemokines  <cit> . during this process, there is a requirement of several time-dependent adhesion events between thymocytes and cells of the thymic microenvironment. among the various molecular mechanisms involved in such heterocellular adhesion, one is represented by fibronectin/integrin mediated interactions. in particular, previous studies using anti-cd49e blocked antibody have shown that such an adhesion is partially under control of the fn/vla- <dig> ligand/receptor pair  <cit> .

herein, we applied the rna interference strategy to silencing the cd49e gene, thus disrupting the integrin vla- <dig> in human thymic epithelial cells. although being transient, in most experiments we got a high efficiency in abrogating the corresponding cd49e mrna, as well as its translation into the α <dig> integrin subunit . moreover, the specificity of the sirna knockdown of the cd49e gene was ascertained by the fact that no effect was seen with a scramble sirna. also, it is interesting that the expression of cd49d  quantified by a specific antibody for the cd49d molecule using flow cytometry, remained unchanged in cd49e-sirna-treated tec. one could argue that another cd49d-containing integrin, namely α4β <dig> integrin might be modulated by cd49e knock down. however, this is not the case, since the vla- <dig> integrin  is actually the only cd49d-containing integrin constitutively expressed by this human thymic epithelial cell preparation, as previously ascertained by immunoprecipitation and cytofluorometry  <cit> . in a second vein, although the expression of cd <dig> mrna  also remain unchanged, we cannot discard the possibility that other members of the vla family , which belongs to the l <dig> family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules, initially discovered in nervous system  <cit> . in this regard, it is been described that nrcam interacts with various integrins including α5β <dig>  and that such interactions can support cell binding and migration  <cit> .

nrcam is part of a growing list of “neural” molecules, also including neuropilins, which are expressed in immune systems, including the thymus   <cit> . in addition to neuropilins, plexin a , and vegf, one of neuropilin natural ligands have been described in the thymus  <cit> . in the human thymus, neuropilins mediate thymocyte migration  <cit> . all these genes are down-regulated following sirna-induced cd49e knockdown in human tec, strongly indicating the existence of a highly complex intracellular molecular circuitry in the thymic epithelium, controlling the expression of various genes involved in physiological guidance of developing thymocytes within the thymic lobules. it is conceivable that the mechanisms underlining such control may comprise direct as well as indirect effects of cd49e gene knockdown, as for example via modulation of specific micrornas that target those genes, down- or up-regulated after cd49e silencing. dissecting this circuitry shall provide a much better understanding of how the tec network controls thymocyte migration and adhesion. in a second vein, the microarray analysis revealed that sirna-induced knockdown of cd49e in cultured human tec also deregulated the expression of signal transduction genes, some of them related with intracellular pathways triggered by integrins. the binding of fibronectin to α5β <dig> activates two major tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways, the focal adhesion kinase  pathway and the shc pathway  <cit> . fak is recruited to the ligand binding site and becomes activated through phosphorilation of tyrosine residues  <cit> . in turn, activation of fak directly phosphorylates src-family protein-tyrosine kinases  <cit> . additionally, fak can form an association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase , and such an association activates pi3k and its signaling pathways  <cit> , regulating, among other functions, the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the regulation of actin fibers by pi3k can be mediated by centaurin α- <dig>  a phosphatidylinositol interacting protein, which directly interacts with f-actin, resulting in a decrease in stress fibers, as ascertained in hela cells  <cit> .

in our microarray data, we noticed that sirna-induced cd49e gene silencing in human tec resulted in up-regulation of the centaurin α- <dig> gene. moreover, the down-regulation of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type i  mrna, that is the predominant kinase that synthesized phosphatidylinositol  <dig> -bisphosphate  <cit>  also indicates a decrease in stress fibers in tec with cd49e knocked down. although we have not directly tackled this issue, such a decrease in f-actin could explain, at least partially, the decrease in the ability of cd49e-sirna-treated tec to promote thymocyte adhesion.

among genes down-regulated in human cultured tec in which cd49e was knocked down by rna interference, we also found the activin receptor-like kinase  <dig> gene , which encodes a type i cell-surface receptor  for transforming growth factor-β <dig> . this cytokine is involved in the control of t cell development through direct effect on both thymocyte and epithelial cell compartments  <cit> . thus, it is conceivable that integrity of vla- <dig> in human tec is necessary to maintain proper levels one tgf-β receptor, thus allowing cross-talk between developing thymocytes and tec.

our results point some genes differential express due the cd49e silencing, however we can’t discard the effect of integrin crosstalk, a mechanism in which one integrin regulates the activation state of a different integrin in the same cell and this phenomenon involve the cytoskeleton associated protein talin  <cit> . in addition, the integrin crosstalk may be at the level of regulation the stability of integrin subunit mrna  <cit> . we are just beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved in regulating the activation state of integrins and the molecular basis of crosstalk.

finally, our data clearly show that knocking down the cd49e in human tec, using rna interference, results in a significant decrease in the ability of these cells to allow thymocyte adhesion. such a decrease comprised all cd4/cd8-defined thymocyte subsets, a finding that is in accordance with the data showing that variable amounts of vla- <dig> are expressed throughout the stages of intrathymic t cell differentiation  <cit> . whether other integrin-mediated tec/thymocyte adhesion interactions are also modulated after cd49e gene knockdown  is presently under investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present study shows that sirna-mediated knockdown of the fibronectin receptor α <dig> integrin chain cd49e in human thymic epithelial cells modulates, directly or indirectly, the expression of multiple genes and decreases thymocyte adhesion. among the genes differentially expressed other cell adhesion related molecules were down-regulated, including neuronal cell adhesion molecule, neuropilin- <dig>  plexin a and vascular endothelial growth factor. additionally, more than  <dig> genes are modulated in human tec following knockdown of cd49e. some of these genes are related to intracellular signaling pathways that can be triggered following fibronectin binding to vla- <dig>  conceptually, these findings unravel the complexity of gene regulation, as regards integrin-integrin crosstalk and key genes involved in the heterocellular cell adhesion between developing thymocytes and the major component of the thymic microenvironment. at biological level, analyses of the effects result from manipulation the expression of an integrin subunit are complicated by the integrin crosstalk. further characterization of the relationship between these genes and their corresponding proteins will offer a more complete understanding of the cellular pathways affected by cd49e gene knockdown and may lead to a better comprehension of the tightly regulated process in which different thymic microenvironmental cells, including tec, support interactions and signals required for the proper intrathymic t cell development.
