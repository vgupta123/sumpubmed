BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia worldwide, affecting approximately  <dig> million people currently  <cit> . by  <dig>  according to some estimates,  <dig> in  <dig> persons worldwide will be affected by ad  <cit> . currently available treatments for ad provide largely symptomatic relief with only minor effects on the course of the disease. the diagnostic neuropathological lesions of ad are the accumulation of aβ as neuritic plaques and congophilic angiopathy, as well as aggregation of abnormally phosphorylated tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles  <cit> . the dominant theory for the causation of ad has been the amyloid cascade hypothesis  <cit> . this theory currently suggests that accumulation of aβ peptides particularly in a highly toxic oligomeric form is the primary pathogenic driver, that downstream leads to tau hyperphosphorylation, nft formation and ultimately to synaptic and neuronal loss. a recent study using oligomers derived from synthetic aβ peptides reported that a high affinity specific binding site for aβ oligomers is the cellular prion protein  and that prpc is a requirement for acute aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices  <cit> . furthermore, it was shown that a monoclonal anti-prp antibody  6d <dig> could block this aβ oligomer mediated toxicity in hippocampal slices  <cit> . in addition it was recently shown that prpc expression is necessary for memory impairment in an ad transgenic  mouse model  <cit> . however, another study, while confirming that prpc is a high affinity binding site for aβ oligomers, suggested that memory impairment induced by acute injection of aβ oligomers derived from synthetic peptides does not require prpc  <cit> . we sought to test the hypothesis that short term treatment using monoclonal 6d <dig> could reverse memory impairment in an established app/ps <dig> tg mouse model of ad  <cit> . such an approach to block in vivo derived aβ oligomer mediated toxicity would represent a novel treatment strategy for ad.

RESULTS
treatment and behavioral studies
cognitive ability was assessed by the number of errors  in consuming all  <dig> rewards using the radial arm maze . statistical analysis by two-way anova revealed a significant treatment effect in tg 6d <dig> treated versus vehicle treated mice  with a bonferroni post-hoc analysis showing no difference between tg 6d <dig> treated and wild-type mice which were injected with either pbs alone or 6d <dig>  app/ps <dig> tg vehicle treated mice and app/ps <dig> mice treated with mouse igg made significantly more errors than wild-type animals and 6d <dig> treated tg mice . the app/ps <dig> tg groups given vehicle  or mouse igg did not show statistically significant differences.

immunohistochemical analyses for amyloid burden by stereology
immunohistochemistry of tissue sections revealed no significant difference in amyloid plaque burden in both the cortex and hippocampus of 6d <dig> treated tg versus vehicle treated tg mice using stereological methods .

immunohistochemical analyses for synaptic density
histological sections showed statistically significant greater synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus among tg mice treated with 6d <dig> monoclonal antibody versus vehicle treated tg animals  .

tissue homogenization and sandwich elisa for aβ levels
elisa results for 6d <dig> treated tg versus vehicle treated tg mice revealed no significant differences in aβ levels for either formic acid  treated  or diethylamine  treated  brain homogenates by two tailed t-test . analysis of plaque-associated amyloid-β levels in fa treated homogenates presented similar levels in both tg mouse groups for both aβ <dig> and aβ <dig>  dea treatment extraction of non-plaque associated soluble aβ from prepared homogenates also showed comparable levels of soluble aβ <dig> or aβ <dig>  there was a slight trend toward lowered aβ40/ <dig> levels in fa-treated brain homogenates, and raised aβ40/ <dig> levels in dea-treated brain homogenates for 6d <dig> treated tg animals; however, the differences were not statistically significant.

western blot detection and quantification of aβ oligomers and aggregated aβ
levels of aβ oligomers in brain homogenates of 6d <dig> treated tg versus vehicle treated tg mice were detected by oligomer-specific polyclonal antibody, a <dig>  <cit> , and then subjected to densitometric analysis. semiquantitation of a <dig> immunoreactive oligomers  shows no significant difference between the groups . the specificity of a <dig> blotting was confirmed by stripping the membrane and probing with anti-aβ 6e <dig> monoclonal antibody  <cit> . there were no significant differences in the levels of aggregated aβ peptides in 6d <dig> treated versus vehicle treated tg mice as determined by elisa .

western blot detection and quantification of prpc
semiquantitative analysis for areas under the curves representing di-, mono-, and non-glycosylated bands of prpc were similar among all three groups . two-way anova analysis showed no significant differences between 6d <dig> treated tg, vehicle treated tg and wild type control mice for all isoforms of prpc.

discussion
we demonstrate that short term administration of anti-prp mab 6d <dig> is able to reverse cognitive deficits in an ad tg mouse model, as determined by radial arm maze testing. previous studies have shown that aβ oligomers made from synthetic aβ peptides bind to prpc and suppression of ltp in mouse hippocampal slice cultures could be abrogated by mab 6d <dig>  due to blocking the binding of oligomers to prpc  <cit> . in addition a recent study has shown that expression of prpc is required for the manifestation of cognitive deficits in an app/ps <dig> tg mouse model of ad, as determined by morris water maze testing  <cit> . in this study app/ps <dig> tg mice were crossed onto a prpc knock-out  background and it was found that these mice behaved similarly to wild-type mice despite having equivalent aβ and amyloid β precursor protein  levels to app/ps <dig> tg mice expressing prpc  <cit> . in the current study we show that just two weeks of treatment with 6d <dig> in vivo can have major cognitive benefits. it is important that this effect occurs without any significant change in the amyloid burden or aβ peptide levels, determined by stereological and biochemical methods. this is not surprising since past studies of amyloid directed therapeutic interventions, such as vaccination, have shown in ad tg mouse models that behavioural benefits often do not correlate with the overall amyloid burden but with aβ oligomer levels  <cit> . in this study, we also have not altered aβ oligomer or aggregated aβ levels. the likely mechanism of action of the behavioural improvement in the 6d <dig> treated tg mice is by blocking the binding of aβ oligomers to prpc. this is consistent with a critical role of prpc for mediating aβ oligomer toxicity. importantly we show using unbiased stereology that the 6d <dig> treatment in the app/ps <dig> tg mice was associated with greater synaptophysin immunoreactivity in the hippocampus compared to vehicle treated tg mice. hence 6d <dig> treatment ameliorated loss of synaptophsin immunoreactivity. synaptic loss is a hallmark of ad which correlates best with the cognitive status of patients, as demonstrated in many studies using immunoreactivity of the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin  <cit> . reduced synaptophysin immunoreactivity has also been detected in app/ps <dig> tg mouse models, which can be prevented by aβ plaque and aβ oligomer reducing interventions such as immunotherapy  <cit> . it is likely that the behavioural rescue in the 6d <dig> treated app/ps <dig> mice is related to a greater synaptic density compared to tg controls, as quantitated by synaptophysin immunoreactivity.

it has been suggested that prpc may be capable of binding other oligomeric species and function physiologically as a general "aggregation receptor"  <cit> . if this is true, application of mabs such as 6d <dig> or other compounds which block oligomer binding to prpc at the 6d <dig> epitope  could have therapeutic effects for a range of neurodegenerative conformational disorders. interestingly, we have recently shown that 6d <dig> is therapeutically active in vitro and in vivo for prion disease using tissue culture and mouse models of prion infection  <cit> . prion infection is dependent on binding between prpc and prpsc, with transmission of the abnormal conformation to the normal prpc. the 6d <dig> epitope is important for this interaction  <cit> , with prpsc having an abnormal conformation with high β-sheet content similar to aβ oligomers. monoclonal antibodies with epitopes to all the different regions of prpc have been screened for inhibition of prion infection  <cit> . of the few anti-prp mabs with therapeutic activity, several of these have an epitope at or near the 6d <dig> epitope  <cit> , highlighting the importance of this region of prpc for binding to protein structures with an abnormal β-sheet conformation.

a recent study suggested that prpc is not essential for aβ oligomer related toxicity, while confirming the high affinity binding between aβ oligomers and prpc  <cit> . this study used very different methods from what is reported here. in the latter study mice which did not have any ad related pathology from human transgene expression were injected directly into brain ventricles using aβ oligomers derived from synthetic aβ peptides. this represents a sub-optimal animal model for ad pathology  <cit> . furthermore, what represents a biologically relevant aβ oligomer preparation is a subject of some debate with aβ peptide assemblies ranging in mass from dimers up to multimers of ~ <dig> mda having been reported as neurotoxins using in vitro assays  <cit> . in our study we demonstrate blocking of cognitive deficits related to in vivo generated aβ oligomers. the balducci et al. studies also used novel object recognition testing in contrast to radial arm maze or water maze spatial memory testing  <cit> . most behavioural studies using ad tg models examine spatial memory with radial or water maze testing  <cit> , with some studies in ad tg mice having shown impairments of spatial memory but not of object recognition  <cit> . in our own past studies of behaviour where we have used novel object recognition in ad tg mice, this has been a less sensitive measure that is more open to confounding variables  <cit> . hence, these significant methodological differences likely explain the contrasting results. in addition, the recent report that crossing an app/ps <dig> tg mouse onto a prpc ko rescues the mice from any cognitive deficit, despite there being no change to the aβ or amyloid precursor protein levels, clearly points to the importance of prpc in mediating aβ related toxicity  <cit> . our findings are consistent with this report, which also showed that the synaptic density in the app/ps <dig> tg mice on a prp ko background was greater compared to controls, using synaptophysin immunoreactivity. however, this is a controversial and complex area of research, since it is likely that aβ oligomers mediate toxicity via multiple, non-mutually exclusive pathways and the results obtained depend on the experimental setting  <cit> .

in our study we used very large doses of 6d <dig>  this was because only a small fraction of peripherally injected mab would be expected to cross the blood brain barrier . prior studies have established that about ~ <dig> % of the injected dose of igg anti-aβ antibodies cross the bbb and that this small faction can have a significant biological effect  <cit> . we presume that a similar percentage of our 6d <dig> was also able to cross the bbb. we controlled for possible non-specific effects on behaviour of injecting such large doses of 6d <dig> or murine igg by including a group of app/ps <dig> mice which were injected with an equivalent dose of murine igg and a group of wild-type mice injected with the same dose of 6d <dig>  the app/ps <dig> tg mice given the murine igg performed similarly on the radial arm maze to the tg mice given vehicle, while the 6d <dig> injections had no demonstrable behavioural effect in the wild-type mice compared to wild-type mice given vehicle injections. future development of single chain variable region  antibodies based on 6d <dig> or peptidomimetics which also block aβ oligomer binding to prpc at the 6d <dig> epitope, may lead to agents which are even more effective and have better pharmacokinetic properties. however, it is striking that a relatively short term administration of 6d <dig> over a period of  <dig> weeks was able to reverse behavioural deficits associated with a high amyloid burden and high aβ40/ <dig> levels. this suggests the significant potential for blocking the prpc-aβ oligomer interaction as a therapeutic intervention in pre-existing ad. this is in contrast to approaches such as vaccination, which are in current clinical trials  <cit> . immunomodulation has been shown in ad tg mouse studies to be much less effective or ineffective with more advanced disease  <cit>  and in more limited studies in ad patients amyloid removal has not been associated with any significant cognitive benefits  <cit> . the limited autopsy data from the initial human active vaccination trial targeting fibrillar aβ plaque deposits showed that patients had partial or near complete plaque removal and a reduction of aβ load compared to age matched non-immunized controls. however, there were no differences between placebo and active immunization groups in the long-term survival outcome, time to severe dementia and in cognitive outcome measurements such as adas-cog, mmse or dad  <cit> . in living patients, part of a passive immunization trial targeting aβ, a 25% amyloid reduction versus controls was documented using pet imaging methods, in the absence of measurable cognitive benefits  <cit> . these studies highlight the importance of developing interventions which directly target aβ oligomers or downstream toxicity related to aβ oligomer interactions, such as the approach described here.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate in an ad tg mouse model that infusion of an anti-prpc mab, produces a significant behavioural rescue in the setting of advanced disease, even with a relatively short treatment regiment. we presume the mechanism of action is by blocking the binding between aβ oligomers and prpc, resulting in an amelioration of synaptic loss. this finding opens a novel therapeutic approach for ad and perhaps for other conformational neurodegenerative disorders.
