BACKGROUND
eukaryotic dna is wrapped around an octamer of four core histones  that form nucleosomes  <cit> . the epigenetic regulation of gene expression can be affected by methylation on the n-terminal tails of the histones of a gene  <cit> . the differences in epigenetic modification between parents, which are known as epialleles, can be transmitted to the next generation  <cit> . epigenetic modifications can be reprogrammed during development and in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . histone modifications have multiple functions and diversity patterns  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that the trimethylation of histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  represses gene expression via the specific enrichment of h3k27me <dig> in the gene body  <cit> . in contrast, the specific enrichment of trimethylated histone h <dig> on lysine  <dig>  in the gene body activates gene expression  <cit> .

epigenetic modifications are not always identical on different homologous chromosomes in diploid organisms. to identify allelic modifications, single-nucleotide polymorphisms  have been widely used to distinguish allele-specific gene expression and epigenetic modifications, which are known as allele-specific gene expressions , allele-specific dna methylations and allele-specific histone modifications . ashms and allele-specific dna methylations have been detected in plants and animals  <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that mono-ase genes, where only one of the alleles in hybrids is expressed, play important roles in development and stress-induced responses  <cit> . the relationship between ase and allele-specific epigenetic modifications, including allele-specific dna methylations and histone modifications, is supported by the allele-specific epigenetic regulation of imprinting genes  <cit> . in mice,  <dig> genes  have ase or allele-specific h3k4me <dig> enrichment with a negative correlation with ashm  <cit> . in a rice f <dig> hybrid,  <dig> ase genes  correlate with ashm in the indica-japonica f <dig> hybrid  <cit> . however, ashms in the indica-indica rice f <dig> hybrid have not been studied.

in this study, allele-specific h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> modifications were analyzed in two rice f <dig> hybrids, guangluai  × 93- <dig> and gl × teqing , and their parents. we used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing  to investigate the ashm patterns of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in gl × 93- <dig> and gl × tq. we found strong correlations between ashm in the f <dig> hybrids and the epialleles from the parents. further studies indicated that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the epialleles were faithfully inherited by the f <dig> hybrid and contributed to  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the ashm genes. importantly,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the monoallelic expression genes had the h3k36me <dig> modification, and ase was strong correlated with ashm. these results indicate that the regulatory effects of ashm-h3k36me <dig> on ase are stronger than those of h3k27me <dig>  our results show that h3k36me <dig> may play an important role in the regulation of ase in rice f <dig> hybrids.

RESULTS
the frequency of ashms in rice f <dig> hybrids
to investigate the ashm profiles in rice hybrids, we used three elite rice indica varieties, guangluai- <dig> , yangdao- <dig>  and teqing , and two f <dig> hybrids  that were generated from these three varieties. these elite varieties represent the breeding objectives at different historical breeding stages in china. the gene repression epigenetic marker h3k27me <dig> and the gene activation epigenetic marker h3k36me <dig> were chosen for this study. sequencing depths of  <dig> - <dig>  million unique mapped reads  for h3k27me <dig> and  <dig> - <dig>  million unique mapped reads for h3k36me <dig> were obtained using chip-seq . a total of  <dig>   and  <dig>   snps were available for ashm analysis from the deep sequencing of the three varieties  <cit> . of the available snps,  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads in gl × 93- <dig> and  <dig>  to  <dig>  reads in gl × tq were available for the allelic histone modification analysis of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> .

a total of  <dig>  h3k27me3-modified genes and  <dig>  h3k36me3-modified genes in gl × 93- <dig> were detected with a threshold of read coverage defined by randomization . a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes that satisfied the criteria of more than nine snps in the gene body region were chosen for further allelic-specific histone modification analysis. in gl × tq,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were modified with h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> modifications, respectively. of these genes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   were available for ashm analysis. we found that  <dig> genes  from gl alleles and  <dig> genes  from 93– <dig> alleles showed preferential allelic h3k27me <dig> modification ;  <dig> genes  from gl alleles and  <dig> genes  from 93– <dig> alleles showed preferential allelic h3k36me <dig> modification in gl × 93- <dig> . a total of  <dig> genes  from gl alleles and  <dig> genes from tq alleles  showed preferential allelic h3k27me <dig> modification , while  <dig> genes  from gl alleles and  <dig> genes  from tq alleles showed preferential allelic h3k36me <dig> modification . our results indicate the genome-wide frequency of ashms in rice f <dig> hybrids is much higher than that of the previous studies  <cit> .figure  <dig>

allelic histone modifications in f <dig> hybrids were correlated with epialleles
previous studies have demonstrated that ashms may be inherited from epialleles of the parents or may be induced during development  <cit> . to determine the inheritance of histone modifications in the heterozygous status, we analyzed the correlation of allelic histone modifications between the f <dig> hybrids and their parents. first, based on the gene body-specific distribution patterns of the h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> modifications , we quantitated the h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> modification levels by normalizing the reads as the number of reads per kilobase per million reads  within the gene bodies. the correlation coefficients between the parent histone modification differences and the ashm in the f <dig> hybrids ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for both h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> . a total of  <dig> h3k27me3-modified genes and  <dig> h3k36me3-modified genes were identified as differently modified genes between gl and 93– <dig> ,  <dig> h3k27me3-modified genes and  <dig> h3k36me3-modified genes were identified as differently modified genes between gl and tq. these differentially modified genes between the parents were designated as epialleles. interestingly, strong correlation coefficients were detected for the epialleles  . furthermore,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the h3k27me <dig> epialleles in the gl versus 93– <dig> and  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the h3k36me <dig> epialleles  in gl versus tq were identified as ashm in their f <dig> hybrids . these results indicate that epialleles mainly contribute to ashm in f <dig> hybrids.figure  <dig>

inheritance and reprogramming of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in f <dig> hybrids exhibited biological functional diversity
in addition to epiallele inheritance from parents, alternative processes could generate allelic histone modifications resulting from the reprogramming of histone modifications in f <dig> hybrids  <cit> . to investigate the epiallele inheritance and reprogramming of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> from parents to f <dig> hybrids, we compared two histone allele-specific modification differences between both of the parents in the f <dig> hybrids. the results showed that  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the allele-specific h3k27me <dig> genes and  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  of the allele-specific h3k36me <dig> genes were modified in the f <dig> hybrids. however, the histone modification levels of these genes did not show differences between the parents . the reprogramming of the ashm genes occurred in the f <dig> hybrid. therefore, we speculate that the inheritance and reprogramming of the ashm genes could present functional diversity in the f <dig> hybrids. to confirm this hypothesis, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis. these results demonstrate that inherited epialleles with either h3k27me <dig> or h3k36me <dig> enrichment were involved in the biological processes of apoptosis and defense response , whereas the reprogrammed ashm genes were involved in the regulation of transcription, metabolic processes, oxidation-reduction and proteolysis . in addition, the reprogramming of biallelic histone modification  or ashm genes in the f <dig> hybrids exhibited functional diversity . our data indicate clear functional diversity between the inheritance and reprogramming of the ashm genes in the f <dig> hybrid, which could help elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of the two types of allelic histone modifications for gene expression profiles.figure  <dig>

differentially modified genes between parents and hybrids are attributed to ashm genes in the f <dig> hybrids
to determine whether ashms contribute to differentially modified genes, we analyzed the rpkm level of the ashm genes. of the analyzed genes,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the genes were ashm genes with either h3k27me <dig> or h3k36me <dig> modifications . to further explore whether ashm genes could lead to differences in histone modification, we analyzed the differential modification genes of h3k27me <dig> or h3k36me <dig> modifications between the f <dig> hybrid and the parents. we found that  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the ashm genes with h3k27me <dig> or h3k36me <dig> modifications contributed to  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the differentially modified genes between the parents and the hybrids  in contrast, only  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the non-differentially modified genes exhibited ashm genes . taken together, our results indicate that ashms primarily contribute to differentially modified genes in f <dig> hybrids.figure  <dig>

ashm-h3k36me <dig> involved in regulating allelic specific gene expression
previous studies have demonstrated that ashms regulate allele-specific expression  in mice  <cit> . to investigate the effect of ashms on ase in rice f <dig> hybrids, we analyzed the relationship between the expression of allele-specific genes and allele-specific modifications in the two f <dig> hybrids. the ase genes that were detected in gl × 93- <dig> and gl × tq were used for this study  <cit> . we found that  <dig> to  <dig> of the ase genes exhibited h3k27me <dig> modification and that  <dig> to  <dig>  of the ase genes exhibited h3k36me <dig> modification in both of the f <dig> hybrids. no significant correlation of the allelic h3k27me <dig> with ase  was detected in either of the f <dig> hybrids . however, a positive correlation of the allelic h3k36me <dig> with ase was detected in both of the f <dig> hybrids  . these results indicate that h3k36me <dig> is involved in the regulation of ase, whereas h3k27me <dig> is not. our data indicate that different histone modifications play different roles in regulating ase.figure  <dig>

monoallelic expression genes are thought to be extremely important for development  <cit> . however, the roles of epigenetic elements in monoallelic expression genes are not fully understood, especially in higher plants. in previous study,  <dig> and  <dig> monoallelic expression genes were identified in gl × 93- <dig> and gl × tq, respectively, and no imprinted genes have been found  <cit> . a total of  <dig> monoallelic expression genes in gl × 93- <dig> and  <dig> monoallelic expression genes with histone modifications in gl × tq were detected. we found that  <dig> of  <dig>  monoallelic expression genes exhibited ashm-h3k36me <dig>  and five of  <dig> monoallelic expression genes exhibited the h3k27me <dig> modification in gl × 93- <dig> . the same results were observed in gl × tq; i.e.,  <dig>  of  <dig> monoallelic expression genes exhibited ashm-h3k27me <dig> , whereas  <dig>  of  <dig> monoallelic expression genes exhibited ashm-h3k36me <dig> . these results indicate that h3k36me <dig> primarily contributes to monoallelic expression in the rice f <dig> hybrids.figure  <dig>

discussion
although global epigenetic modifications have been investigated in japonica-indica hybrids of nipponbare and 93– <dig>  <cit> , a study focusing on indica-indica hybrids in foundation varieties has not been conducted. in this study, we studied global allele-specific epigenetic modifications by performing high-depth chip-seq of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in two indica-indica f <dig> hybrids, gl/93- <dig> and gl/tq. our epigenome data with two histone modifications demonstrate that ashms are widely detected in f <dig> hybrids. our data will be helpful in understanding the relationships between allelic histone modifications and ase in rice f <dig> hybrids.

more than half of the ashm genes in the f <dig> hybrids were equally modified in the parents , and the epialleles were inherited and reprogrammed in the f <dig> hybrids. we detected a large number of epialleles, and those that contributed to ashm caused a large number of differentially modified genes in the f <dig> hybrids. these results indicate that epialleles play important roles in ashm and in differentially modified genes. furthermore,  <dig> % to  <dig> % of epialleles were inherited by f <dig> hybrids, and  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the epialleles were reprogrammed in the f <dig> hybrids . more interestingly, the inheritance and reprogramming of epialleles were involved in different biological processes . the reprogramming of the epialleles in the f <dig> hybrid, derived from genetic polymorphism of snps, provided more options to regulate the global gene expression profile in the f <dig> hybrid. thus, the reprogramming of histone modifications between alleles in the f <dig> hybrids may cause superior fitness under various environmental conditions, including biotic and non-biotic stresses, which may contribute to heterosis.

although histone modifications are generally recognized as epigenetic modifications, not all histone modifications are heritable  <cit> . however, histone methylation is quite stable compared to other modifications, such as histone phosphorylation and acetylation, during the cell cycle. we found strong correlations between the epialleles and ashm . the majority of differentially modified genes were derived from ashm genes . previous studies have demonstrated that differentially modified genes are closely related to differentially expressed genes  <cit> , which are widely recognized as the basis of heterosis  <cit> . our findings of the relationships between ashm, differentially modified genes and differentially expressed genes in f <dig> hybrids indicate that the epialleles could provide a genetic basis for heterosis and general combining ability  <cit> . therefore, epialleles may be used as criteria for screening hybrids with higher heterosis in hybrid rice breeding programs.

in general, histone methylations that are associated with gene silencing  are more stable than are histone methylations that are associated with gene activation   <cit> . in this study,  <dig> % to  <dig> % and  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the analyzed genes exhibited ashm in h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> modifications, respectively. the proportions of allele-specific h3k27me <dig> were much greater than were those of allele-specific h3k36me <dig> in both of the f <dig> hybrids , although the ashm gene numbers were approximately equal, indicating that h3k36me <dig> modification is more effective in ashm than h3k27me <dig> modification. our data indicate that the regulatory effects of h3k36me <dig> modification on ase are greater than are those of the h3k27me <dig> modification, suggesting that different histone modifications may have different roles in the regulation of gene expression in f <dig> hybrids  <cit> .

several types of epigenetic modifications are involved in ase regulation  <cit> . in mice, ase or h3k4me <dig> enrichment ) are negatively correlated with allele-specific dna methylation  <cit> . in indica-japonica hybrid rice, only  <dig> ase genes  have been reported to undergo allele-specific modification  <cit> . in this study, significant correlations were observed between allelic gene expression and allelic h3k36me <dig> but not allelic h3k27me <dig> . the histone modification frequency within the gene body is higher than that of dna methylation in rice  <cit> . in contrast to dna methylation and h3k27me <dig> modification, we found that h3k36me <dig> modification primarily regulates ase. our results indicate that ashm-h3k36me <dig> mainly contributes to ase, suggesting that ashm-h3k36me <dig> could play a more important role in ase than ashm-h3k27me <dig> modifications.

CONCLUSIONS
the profiles of h3k27me <dig> and h3k36me <dig> in two indica-indica f <dig> hybrids were investigated using chip-sequencing technology. a total of  <dig> to  <dig> allele-specific h3k27me <dig> genes and  <dig> to  <dig> allele-specific h3k36me <dig> genes were detected in gl × 93- <dig> and gl × tq, accounting for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total analyzed genes, respectively. the epialleles between parents were highly related to ashms. ashm genes mainly showed differential modification between parents and hybrids. our findings indicate that ashm-h3k36me <dig>  rather than h3k27me <dig>  mainly regulates ase in hybrid rice.
