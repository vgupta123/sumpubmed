BACKGROUND
bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  is an alphaherpesvirus responsible for meningoencephalitis in young cattle, and is antigenically and genetically closely related to bovine herpesvirus  <dig>   <cit> . the origin and geographic distribution of bohv- <dig> infections are largely unknown, mainly due to serological cross-reactivity with bohv- <dig>  <cit> . sporadic cases of meningoencephalitis by bohv- <dig> have been reported in australia  <cit> , usa  <cit> , italy  <cit>  and hungary  <cit> . in contrast, bohv- <dig> infection and disease appear to be more frequent in argentina and brazil, where numerous outbreaks were described in the last decades  <cit> . the rare occurrence of bohv- <dig> neurological disease in areas where bohv- <dig> infection is endemic may be explained by cross-protection induced by natural infection or vaccination  <cit> .

bohv- <dig> infection induces either a subclinical infection or disease of moderate severity in adult cattle  <cit>  and lethal encephalitis in young animals  <cit> .

virological assays are very accurate tools to specifically diagnose bohv- <dig> infections. virus isolation in cell culture can be performed from fresh or frozen nasal secretions, semen or post mortem samples  <cit> . however, in light of recent reports of bovine herpesviruses isolated from different samples, and responsible for both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections  <cit> , classical diagnostic methods are not sufficient for a fast and easy identification and subtyping of the infectious virus.

several assays are available to differentiate bohv- <dig> from bohv- <dig>  including immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies  <cit> , pcr followed by rea  <cit> , nested pcr  <cit> , multiplex pcr  <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna   <cit> , and multiple pcr sequencing assays  <cit> . moreover, bsteii restriction enzyme analysis  of the complete virus genome can differentiate between bohv- <dig> subtypes; but the technique is laborious and needs substantial amounts and quality of viral dna  <cit> . in addition, a recently described ul27pcr-rea  <cit>  assay has been shown to differentiate between bohv- <dig> subtypes a and b but it cannot differentiate the subtype c.

we here describe a molecular technique that allows the detection and differentiation of all bohv- <dig> subtypes. we also report the identification and characterization of two new bohv- <dig> isolates from the argentinean provinces of buenos aires and chaco. one of them corresponds to a symptomatic case obtained during an outbreak of neurological disease in a cattle herd, while the other corresponds to a non symptomatic case isolated from a bovine semen sample.

this development could be epidemiologically relevant in areas where bohv- <dig> infection is endemic, and provides a new tool for the fast diagnosis and subtyping of bohv- <dig> 

RESULTS
differential pcr for bohv <dig> and bohv5
the new virus isolates  <dig> and  <dig> were tested by multiplex pcr  <cit>  and shown to be bohv- <dig> 

rea
one of the new field isolates  showed a bsteii rea pattern similar to reference strain n <dig>  which is the bohv-5a prototype, and the other  showed a pattern similar to reference strain a <dig>  the bohv-5b prototype . a double  <dig> kb band was observed in the first case, but it fell outside of the area used for subtype classification.

determination of a differential restriction site for a and c subtypes
fragments  of the ul <dig> gene from bohv- <dig> subtypes a , b  and c  were sequenced. sequence alignment revealed a point mutation  in the bsteii restriction site for subtype c , as compared to subtype a, responsible for the variation in the rea pattern . this point mutation did not result in an amino acid change.

multiplex ul27/ul <dig> pcr and bsteii restriction analysis
in the new assay developed in this work, the differential expected band pattern for each of the three bohv- <dig> subtypes after multiplex pcr-rea is shown in figure  <dig>  the pcr products after digestion showed different cleaved combinations. the band of  <dig> bp is cleaved into two bands of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. moreover the band of  <dig> bp is cleaved into two bands of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. isolates  <dig> and  <dig> showed band patterns similar to bohv-5b and bohv-5a prototypes, respectively . in addition, when dna of the three different bohv- <dig> subtypes was used as template, amplification products could not be digested by bsteii .

sensitivity of the test
the multiplex pcr assay detected as few as  <dig> to  <dig> ng/μl of purified bohv- <dig> dna or approximately  <dig> to  <dig> genome copies. in the case of dna extracted from infected tissue homogenates the assay detected down to  <dig>  genome copies.

discussion
in countries like argentina and brazil where circulation of bohv- <dig> is high and viral subtypes not described elsewhere in the world occur, there is a need for rapid and easy diagnostic tools which allow the classification of viral species and subtypes. in this work, a new multiplex pcr-rea that easily identifies all bohv- <dig> subtypes was developed and improves previous assay reported by claus  <cit> . the latter can be used as a confirmatory test for the detection of this virus and only allows species differentiation between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig>  while our multiplex pcr – rea permits simultaneous subtyping of the isolates. this method was applied to  <dig> previously characterized virus isolates  <cit>  and  <dig> newly identified ones. results were identical to those obtained with the classical bohv- <dig> subtyping technique . when different bohv- <dig> subtypes were used as template for this multiplex pcr-rea, fragments of different molecular weight, as compared to bohv- <dig>  were obtained. multiplex pcr-rea is more sensitive, faster, less laborious and more economical than the traditional whole genome restriction analysis, and can detect dna both from purified virus and tissues.

the protocol uses two pairs of primers for the simultaneous amplification of ul <dig> and ul <dig> segments. due to the molecular weight differences in the amplified fragments after digestion, it is possible to clearly distinguish the characteristic bands of each subtype by visual analysis of agarose gels. amplicon sequencing allowed to find the point mutation responsible for the change on the restriction site of the enzyme bsteii and thus, for the different profiles obtained for a and c subtypes . this mutation was, until now, only observed in subtype c  strain, isolated in brazil  <cit> . we showed here the analysis of one out of two bohv-5c subtypes reported until now in the world.

the method showed a detection sensitivity of  <dig> bohv- <dig> genome copies of purified virus and  <dig>  ×  <dig> bohv- <dig> genome copies from tissue samples.

nineteen bohv- <dig> field isolates, including two newly identified ones, were subtyped using the described method. one of the two new isolates included in this work was isolated from cryopreserved bovine semen. to our knowledge, this is the first report of bohv- <dig> virus identification from semen in argentina. this sample was classified as subtype b by multiplex pcr-rea, constituting the last and one of the three bohv-5b isolates characterized so far. although no virulence differences between a and b subtypes have been found  <cit> , subtype identification is relevant to understand virus genetic variability and contribute to molecular epidemiology studies. noteworthy, the virally contaminated semen was harvested from an apparently healthy bull. this finding agrees with similar results obtained in brazil and australia  <cit> . whether bohv- <dig> transmitted to a cow via artificial insemination  can cause neurological disorders in the recipient remains to be determined. given the widespread use of ai to diversify cattle stocks, detection of animal viruses in semen, either by virus isolation or pcr, is crucial. in conclusion, the multiplex pcr-rea described in this work provides a new tool for the fast diagnosis and subtyping of bohv- <dig>  this development can aid in the understanding and control of these detrimental bovine viral infections.

CONCLUSIONS
fast and easy tools for the characterization of bohv- <dig> viral isolates are required. since, due to technical limitations, sequencing is not an option, the multiplex pcr – rea system described in this work provides an attractive tool for the improved control of bohv- <dig> viral infections.
