BACKGROUND
cytokines have essential roles in positive, negative and regulatory control of immune responses in every compartment. the biological functions of cytokines mainly depend on cytokine-mediated gene activation or repression. studies on gene induction by different cytokines led to the discovery of several signalling pathways including nf-κb, stat and others  <cit> .

various types of specific or innate stimuli activate and phosphorylate the latent cytoplasmic nf-κb/iκb complex, which is ensued by the proteolysis of iκb. the nf-κb p <dig> sub-unit is then released; it is translocated to the nucleus and binds the genes containing κb sites which in turn, upregulates the expression of these gene products  <cit> . a large variety of molecules are able to activate nf-κb such as pamps, il <dig>  tnf, cd40l, baff  <cit> . among activated transcription factors, the nf-κb family is essential for inflammation, innate and specific immunity, cell proliferation and apoptosis. nf-κb is involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, anti-apoptotic gene expression and cell proliferation, therefore, altered nf-κb expression or regulation is involved in immune defaults resulting in cancer  <cit>  and chronic inflammatory diseases  <cit> .

for the stat signalling pathway, the process is slightly different than for nf-κb. the binding of certain cytokines   <cit>  to cell-surface receptors results in receptor dimerization and subsequent activation of jak tyrosine kinases, which are constitutively associated with these receptors. tyrosine residues on the receptor  tails are then phosphorylated by activated jaks and serve as docking sites for a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as stats. members of the stat family are phophorylated by different jaks   <cit> ; then, the relevant stat dimerizes, subsequently leaves the receptor and translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the corresponding gene transcription. there are to date seven human stats: stat  <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat5a, stat5b and stat <dig>  <cit> .

various solid tumors – as well as malignant hemopathies  – in humans have been shown to possess aberrant stat activation. this property is also found – and can be explored – in cell lines derived from solid tumours or leukemias. for example, among the stat family, stat <dig> is frequently activated in both multiple myeloma cell lines  <cit>  and tumors derived from patient bone marrows  <cit> . stat <dig> activation is required for promotion of tumor cell survival and directly contributes to the malignant progression of multiple myeloma by allowing accumulation of long-lived plasma cells  <cit> .

the present investigation will focus on the two principal intracellular pathways translocating into the nucleus – for the first – the nf-κb activation pathway , and – for the other – jak following activation of the stat <dig> pathway . those signalling pathways represent the majority of cytokine-delivered stimuli on receptors displayed on the surface of hematopoietic cells and, by extention, of immune cells  <cit> . currently, studying nf-κb and stat <dig> is possible in elisa  <cit> , western blot  <cit>  and flow cytometry with purified cells  <cit> . the first disadvantage of these three techniques is the pretreatment before analyzing: nuclear isolation which takes a long time and requires an important vigilance. the second disadvantage is the under-estimation of the relationship between the different cellular types. we thus aimed to examine nuclear factor transcription during in vitro activation; this flow cytometry technique is convenient in most laboratories. this gave several advantages  over other measurements of nuclear factors . thus, we developed a flow cytometry technique that studies transcription factors of different cellular types  in homeostasis conditions, in other words without preliminary cell purification. to validate this technique, we compared our data with other techniques.

we present here an original, convenient, and reproducible technique to study various cell  activation events  through nuclear factor translocation  by means of a novel, specific flow cytometry assay. the stimuli chosen were il1β and scd40l to activate the nf-κb pathway and il <dig> to stimulate the stat <dig> pathway. furthermore, these cytokines play a major role in immune responses. the originality of this new technique consists in studying non-purified cells, like some other studies  <cit>  but various cells  in a likely physiological context.

RESULTS
optimization of culture conditions and stimulation for studying transcription factors
as described, screening procedures to analyse phosphorylated products of the nf-κb or stat <dig> pathways prior to flow cytometry, were performed using elisa and western blot techniques. the aim of those preliminary experiments was double: -i) to set up optimized conditions of cell stimulation; -ii) to obtain-conventional – baseline data to be compared with results obtained in the novel – target – technique using detection by flow cytometry.

firstly, pbmcs were stimulated by various activators  at different times . to determine the optimal concentration of each stimulus, we stimulated pbmcs with each activator at various concentrations , and frozen until use. after, the cytokine il- <dig>  was measured in individual culture supernatants using commercial specific elisa kits  according to the manufacturer's instructions. optimal concentration of pbmcs stimulation was obtained with the following concentration,  <dig> ng/ml of il1β,  <dig> ng/ml of scd40l and  <dig> ng/ml of il <dig>  the optimal concentration for each activator conformed to standards in our laboratory  <cit> . in unseparated cell culture conditions  we could observe – by either elisa or wb technique – that intracellular pnf-κb concentration was increased following pbmc stimulation with il1β  and with scd40l . maximum phosphorylation and subsequent product detection was obtained for a  <dig> min stimulation with  <dig> ng/ml of il1β and scd40l  for  <dig> cells  versus unstimulated cells . these conditions were considered to represent the baseline working culture conditions from which to observe any significant difference of pnf-κb concentration between non-activated pbmcs and pbmcs activated by il1β or scd40l.

a similar screening protocol was set up to standardize an optimal pstat <dig> pbmcs response following il <dig> treatment of pbmcs, using western blot and elisa. we indeed show  that pstat <dig> concentration is amplified with il <dig> stimulation: maximal signal product is obtained after a  <dig> min exposure of pbmcs to il <dig> stimulation used at  <dig> ng/ml  versus unstimulated cells . the same signal intensity is achieved for all of the time exposures tested.

development of an original flow cytometry technique to study nuclear transcription factors
having identified optimal conditions for stimulating unseparated pbmcs for the activation of the nuclear translocation factors pnf-κb and pstat <dig>  we set up a flow cytometry technique allowing the study of these nuclear factors at the level of pbmc cellular subpopulations without being obliged to purify these cellular subpopulations in e.g. t-lymphocytes, b-cells, monocytes/macrophages, as was previously a prerequisite.

we show an example of a cytogram that can be obtained with this novel technique to detect transcription factors by means of flow cytometry . the background signals were determined using relevant isotype control antibodies . 7aad negative/pnfkb positive targets are cellular debris – not e.g cytoplasmic nfkb signal. the blots were not always clearly separated and individualized every time. as each cell was not activated to the same extent or level, we were able to observe the activation level from partially activated cells, and from transiently activated cells or non activated cells  <cit> . as can be seen in figure 2a and 2c, within different unseparated pbmc subpopulations, cd19+ b-cells , cd3+ t-lymphocytes , and cd14+ monocytes/macrophages  were cultured in the presence  or absence , of optimal concentrations of il1β  for  <dig> min at 37°c . il1β induced respectively an increase in nuclear pnf-κb translocation by a magnitude , of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for b-cells, of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for t-lymphocytes and of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for monocytes/macrophages. however, il1β did not induce any significant increase of phosphorylated stat3:  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for b-cells,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for t-lymphocytes and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for monocytes/macrophages. the shown cytogram is representative of seven independent experiments. the integration of the sum of individual results is represented in the histograms shown in figure 2b  and 2d : for all the diverse unseparated subpopulations, the level of nuclear pnf-κb translocation increased significantly  in response of il1β under defined conditions  contrary to the level of nuclear pstat <dig> translocation.

induction of pnf-κb translocation following stimulation with scd40l used as predetermined, optimal concentrations, was observed in b-cells and monocytes/macrophages – but, interestingly – not in t-lymphocytes; phosphorylation of nf-κb was significantly  increased vs baseline levels, by a magnitude of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in b-cells and of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in monocytes/macrophages .

in parallel, figure 3b represents the percentage of phosphorylated stat <dig> of the various pbmc cell types in response of optimal il <dig> stimulation of unseparated cultured cells. there is a significant  increase  of nuclear stat <dig> translocation in each cell type, by a magnitude of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in b-cells, of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in t-lymphocytes and of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in monocytes/macrophages.

discussion
a recent review  <cit>  states that the development of phospho-specific intracellular detection necessitates development of reagents and adapted protocols. nuclear translocation of transcription factors can be usually measured by immunoblotting of isolated nuclei by electrophoretic mobility shift assay , or more recently in flow cytometry on purified cells  <cit> . aubry and coworkers described in  <dig> an original technique to study the nf-κb pathway by multichannel flow cytometry after permeabilisation of dcs stimulated with lps  <cit> . next, our group contributed in  <dig> an original approach to study the phosphorylated transcription factor nf-κb in purified b-cells populations originating from blood or lymphoid tissues, with the need to purify the target cells to homogeneity. the main problem of this technique is the loss of information because of not studying cellular events under physiological conditions. now, we understand the influence of the culture environment on any cell and the importance of studying cells within their context. so scientists need more and more techniques which study specific cells in their environment. in this report, we have developed and validated a flow cytometry to study transcription factors for various cell subpopulations within one cell type or a tissue suspension , because there is a need to study rapidly, commonly and reproducibly such parameters  in blood samples representing steady state or pathological conditions. phosphorylation of proteins in signal transduction is traditionally studied by means of western blot analysis and/or elisa, which carry valuable information regarding homogeneous or purified cell populations. the present study proposes an original method to study phosphorylation of proteins in complex, heterogeneous, cell populations such as unseparated pbmcs. this method could be further validated to be applied to whole blood samples obtained from patients presenting with inflammatory diseases, for example, where there is a need to study cellular events  <cit> . indeed, the nf-κb pathway plays a pivotal role in immune and inflammatory responses and has attracted much interest as a novel target for the treatment of inflammatory states. meanwhile, the major interest resides in the identification of cell subsets displaying altered nuclear factor phosphorylation/translocation, thus to be clearly identified by surface membrane characteristics.

multiparameter flow cytometry offers the valuable advantage of characterising, almost without doubt, certain cell surface markers to identify subpopulations in response of a stimulus. in this study, we used  <dig> labelling conditions: one for each cell type, one for dna gating and one for the intracellular factor of interest. in this manner, we marked only one cellular type and one intracellular factor per tube. however, by using a flow cytometer with more excitation lasers, it could be possible to mark dna, all types of cells and the  <dig> intracellular factors in the same tube. here we confirm that intracellular pathways of nf-κb and stat <dig> can be rather easily monitored by western blot and elisa  and il <dig> , according to a general consensus  <cit> . the development of a multiparameter flow cytometry technique permits us to decipher which of the stimulated cell population studied responded to treatment. we evidenced that il1β and scd40l should be used at  <dig> ng/ml for  <dig> min and il <dig> at  <dig> ng/ml for  <dig> min. from the above experiments – principally aiming at presenting a convenient technique for studying and foremost tracing cellular translocation of – for the time being nf-κb and stat  – we could provide evidence that unseparated monocytes/macrophages responded strongly to scd40l and b-cells to il <dig>  this result is not surprising because the literature showed the activation of pbmcs with these cytokines  <cit> . this study has no real impact on the results but on the technique, itself. the obtained results proved this method is valuable to study activation of cells.

in flow cytometry, only  <dig> hours are necessary to prepare the samples and roughly  <dig> hour to acquire and analyse the data. it is the most feasible technique, however, the use of the cytometer and analyse software require training. flow cytometry is not the most sensitive technique but the sensitivity is largely acceptable . relating to the reproducibility, we observe a difference of the basal rate of activation depending on the individual samples. regulated degradation of specific proteins is part of the intracellular biochemical changes that contribute to the regulation of signal transduction pathways; nf-κb activation thus, requires the rapid degradation of iκbα, the inhibitor of nf-κb. before activation, nf-κb is sequestered in the cytoplasm by forming a complex with iκbα, the nuclear translocation signal of nf-κb being masked by the inhibitor. nf-κb can be activated by a number of stimuli, which trigger the phosphorylation of iκbα and lead to the rapid dissociation of nf-κb from iκbα. once released from the iκbα complex, nf-κb immediately translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it mediates the transcriptional activation of genes. at this point of phosphoprotein translocation, it is difficult to see the effective translocation by flow cytometry. 7-amino-actinomycin d  is a convenient, ready-to-use nucleic acid dye that can be used in flow cytometric assays for exclusion of nonviable cells, or to gate nuclei and label nucleic acids, in replacement of propidium iodide  in flow cytometric assays  <cit> . the advantage of 7-aad over pi is its ability to be used in conjunction with phycoerythrin  – and fluorescein isothiocyanate -labelled monoclonal antibodies in 2-color analysis, with minimal spectral overlap. therefore, the relationship of basal degradation to induced degradation remains uncertain  <cit> . moreover, nf-κb regulation of iκbα transcription represents a delayed negative feedback loop that drives oscillations in nf-κb translocation. transcription of target genes depended on oscillation persistence, involving cycles of rela phosphorylation and dephosphorylation  <cit> . the oscillations in nf-κb signalling can explain the background levels of pnf-κb/pstat <dig> positive cells in unstimulated pbmcs. nevertheless, a similar difference between stimulated and non stimulated cells is always detected.

this paper describes a novel flow cytometry method which allows the detection and quantification of intranuclear levels of the transcription factors nf-κb and stat <dig> in distinct pbmcs subpopulations; this technique enables the identification of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and/or cd <dig> subsets – within unseparated pbmcs  – which actually phosphorylate intranuclear proteins upon appropriate stimulation. these strategies will enable the development of simple though robust blood methods to identify normal signalling pathways as well as impairments in phosphorylating proteins in association with various human disease states , or with other chronic diseases characterized by an alteration of the cytokine homeostatic milieu, as seen in profound allergies or in cancer states  <cit> .

in this way, our data stress the differences that are detectable between lymphocytes and monocytes regarding nf-κb or stat <dig> phosphorylation upon relevant stimulation; an explanation could be because monocytes are associated with innate immune responses faster than, for example, t or b-cells, an issue which would deserve closer examination.

in summary, to determine the optimal conditions of activation, elisa is the most practical technique to study at the same time a large quantity of samples. once the optimal conditions have been identified, the western blot and the flow cytometry technique become the most adequate techniques, although the flow cytometry remains the most rapid method.

CONCLUSIONS
our technology to study transcription factors, such as pnf-κb and/or pstat <dig>  could be applicable to infrequent cell subpopulations such as stem cell progenitors or other cells with various stages of maturation/differentiation  <cit> . moreover, this original technology can be used to detect transcription factor translocation; for example to screen a new molecule that induces a cell response.

this flow cytometry technique is very interesting because it can be applicable to different types of cellular relationship studies, in particular in blood transfusion, immunology and oncology. indeed, this method could quantify the activation of immune cells of a transfused person or of a person who received platelets in order to better limit the response. concerning oncology, the nf-κb and stat pathways play important roles in tumorigenesis  <cit> . thus, these intracellular pathways appear very interesting to study in an oncological context. so, this new flow cytometry technique appears very attractive for signal study in pbmcs or tissue conditions.
