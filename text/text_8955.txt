BACKGROUND
a large fraction of genome variation between individuals is comprised of submicroscopic copy number variation of dna segments   <cit> . genomic disorders are the clinical manifestation of pathological cnv. they are frequent conditions  and often sporadic resulting from de novo rearrangements  <cit> . in a subset of such conditions the rearrangements comprise multiple unrelated contiguous genes that are physically linked and thus have been referred to as contiguous gene syndromes . an increasing number of cgs are being described, each of them presenting a complex and specific phenotype. although several genes are usually present in the segmental aneuploidy; only a small subset of them conveys phenotypes as a function of copy number alteration. these particular genes are referred to as "dosage sensitive genes".

the smith-magenis syndrome, sms,  is a cgs associated with a microdeletion within chromosome  <dig> band p <dig> . sms was first described in  <dig> with a birth prevalence estimated at 1/ <dig> . the clinical phenotype includes craniofacial abnormalities, brachydactyly, self injurious behavior, sleep abnormalities and mental retardation. less commonly reported is cleft palate, congenital heart defects, seizures, hearing impairment and urinary tract anomalies  <cit> . molecular studies revealed a common deleted region of ~ <dig> mb in the majority of sms patients   <cit> . unusual sized deletions  were observed in 20-25% of patients  <cit> . by examining the breakpoints in unusual sized deletions, the sms critical region was redefined to a ~ <dig> kb interval, in which  <dig> genes and eight predicted genes were present  <cit> . retinoic acid induced  <dig> gene  is located in the middle of the sms critical region. point mutations  in rai <dig> were identified in patients with clinical presentation of sms but no molecular deletion found by fish  <cit> , suggesting that rai <dig> is the dosage sensitive gene causative of sms. studies on mouse models  <cit>  and humans  <cit>  indicate that rai <dig> is likely the dosage sensitive gene responsible for clinical features in the potocki-lupski syndrome ,  a neurobehavioral disorder with autistic features that is caused by reciprocal duplication of the 17p <dig>  region  <cit> . the rai <dig> gene consists of six exons  <cit>  that span over  <dig> kb. the third exon contains >90% of the coding region and it is within this exon where all mutations have been identified to date.

little is known about the cellular and developmental role of rai <dig>  expression of gt <dig>  a splice variant of rai <dig> was markedly up-regulated by treatment with retinoic acid in a mouse carcinoma cell line p <dig>  <cit> . a polymorphic cag repeat is present in the n-terminus of the rai <dig> protein, the length of which is associated with the age of onset of spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  <cit>  and the response to neuroleptic medication in schizophrenia  <cit> . moreover, rai <dig> was recently associated with non syndromic autism  <cit> . bioinformatic analyses have suggested that rai <dig> might be a transcriptional regulator  <cit> . rai <dig> contains several patches of 50% similarity with tcf <dig>  a transcriptional cofactor, and these two genes have a similar gene structure. rai <dig>  in both human and mouse, have two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals  predicted in silico, and possesses a zinc finger like plant homeo domain  in the c-terminus, which is also present in the trithorax family of chromatin remodeling transcriptional regulators  <cit> . in vitro studies of the murine rai <dig> protein indicated that it can be transported to the nucleus and has transactivation activity  <cit> . however, no systematic analysis of the human rai <dig> protein has been done. here we describe the characterization of the wild type rai <dig> protein, plus five mutated forms of the protein, including four that have been associated with the sms clinical phenotype. subcellular localization of the resulting proteins and transcription factor activity were studied for the wild type and mutant forms. our results indicate that the transcription factor activity and subcellular localization of the protein are essential for the pathogenic outcome of some of the mutated forms.

RESULTS
the transcription factor activity of the murine rai <dig> protein is dependent on the cell type
human and mouse rai <dig> share more than 80% in dna and amino acid homology sequence. moreover, several mouse models for sms were developed and studied, and they presented similar phenotypes to those found in the sms patients, reinforcing the idea of a comparable function for murine and human rai <dig>  <cit> . a previous report by bi et al.,  <cit>  showed that the murine rai <dig> protein presented a mild transcription factor activity and a nuclear subcellular localization. in order to corroborate previous findings and to set up the optimal conditions for our studies of human rai <dig>  we subcloned the murine rai <dig> full-length cdna kindly donated by dr. james lupski, into different vectors that allowed us to see the molecular weight, subcelullar localization and transcription factor activity of the murine protein . the expected  <dig>  kda molecular weight for the murine protein was similar to the obtained molecular weight  , as well as the nuclear subcellular localization . it was previously reported that rai <dig> has relatively weak transactivation activity in transfected hela cells in comparison to other transcription factors  <cit> . neurobehavioral abnormalities are the prevalent clinical presentation in sms patients. based on this we wanted to examine whether rai <dig> has a different transactivation activity in cells derived from murine neuroblastoma, the neuro-2a cell line. in order to do this, full-length rai <dig> was fused with the gal <dig> dna binding domain  and co-transfected into hela and neuro-2a cells with a luciferase reporter plasmid which contains five tandem repeats of yeast gal4-binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene, plus a plasmid containing the beta galactosidase gene to control transfection efficiency. the results showed that the transcription factor activity in hela cells is  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  folds over the empty vector and in neuro-2a cells is  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  indicating that the murine protein has a transactivational activity several times stronger in the neuro-2a cell line than in hela cells, suggesting that there is a specific machinery in neuronal cells that may be related to rai <dig> transcription factor activity .

human rai <dig> is a nuclear protein with transcription factor activity
in a first attempt to understand and characterize the function of human rai <dig> we generated the full-length cdna coding for the wild type protein. the full-length cdna was obtained as described in material and methods. the final full-length sequence is the same as the one reported in nm_ <dig> with snp a/g at position  <dig>  in order to have an easy way to identify the transfected rai <dig> from the endogenous protein, an ha tag was added in the 3' end . since we found that rai <dig> activity was dependent of cellular type, we performed all our studies in mouse neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. neuro-2a cell line was preferred over the sh-sy5y  cell line despite its murine origin, since the human ones grow at an extremely slow rate and making them very difficult to transfect. in order to determine the molecular weight of the protein, both clones the rai <dig> and rai1-ha cdna were transiently transfected, and  <dig> h post-transfection the cell lysate was run in a 10% sds-page gel. the predicted in silico molecular weight for rai <dig> is  <dig> kda. as can be observed in figure 1b, the molecular weight of both proteins is ~ <dig> kda, and the addition of the ha tag is not inducing instability of the resulting protein. the difference between the molecular weight predicted and the obtained could be explained by post-translational modifications  for example glycosylations. we found several predicted glycosylation sites on the first amino-terminal half of rai <dig>   <cit> .

to prove if the human protein has transcription factor activity, we subcloned the rai <dig> and rai1-ha full-length cdna into a gal4-binding domain vector . it is important to note that the presence of the gal4-binding domain is enough to localize the protein to the nucleus  <cit> . transfection of each clone plus the reporter gene was carried out and  <dig> h post-transfection the cells were lysed and the activity of the luciferase reporter gene was measured. as can be seen in figure 1d, the expression of the wild type rai <dig> and rai1-ha derives in an  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  fold increase of the luciferase activity respectively, indicating that the human protein presented transcription factor activity and that the addition of the ha tag did not interfere with the activity of the resulting protein. rai <dig> has a bipartite nuclear localization signal predicted by informatics analysis  <cit> . nuclear subcellular localization was found for both, the rai <dig> and rai-ha proteins  at  <dig> h post-transfection and this result was confirmed with two different antibodies, one that recognized an epitope within the first  <dig> amino acids in the n-terminus portion of the rai <dig> protein and the anti ha antibody, which recognized the c-terminus end in the rai1-ha clone. these results indicate that the human rai <dig> protein, with or without the ha tag, has a nuclear localization and the ability to activate the transcription of a reporter gene.

the n-terminal truncated rai <dig> polypeptides retain the transcription factor activity but localize in the cytoplasm
most smith-magenis cases present a deletion in chromosome 17p <dig>  that causes the haploinsufficiency of the rai <dig> gene. however, in some patients heterozygous mutations have been found within the rai <dig> coding region. in order to study how these mutations can be detrimental we analyzed two independent deletions of one c within the coding region, the rai <dig> 2687delc  and the rai <dig> 3103delc  <cit>  . theoretically in both cases the deletion of a c within the c tract will result in a frameshift, misincorporation of amino acids and a subsequent premature stop codon. in the case of rai1-ha 2687delc a misincorporation of  <dig> amino acids followed by a stop codon is expected, while in the rai1-ha 3103delc protein the misincorporation will be  <dig> amino acids. in order to avoid the possible interference of the misincorporated amino acids in the following studies we also generated the rai <dig> r960x mutation  <cit> , where an arginine is replaced by a stop codon in the coding sequence generating a truncated protein, with no addition of extra amino acids. in order to determine the molecular weight of the resulting proteins, the three clones were transiently transfected, and  <dig> h post-transfection the cell lysate was run in a 10% sds-page gel. the predicted molecular weights for the proteins originated by rai1-ha 2687delc, rai1-ha 3103delc and rai <dig> r960x are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda respectively. as can be observed in figure 2b, the obtained molecular weight of the three truncated proteins was ~ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda respectively. these differences coincide with the predicted versus observed molecular weight differences found for the wild type protein with or without the ha tag, suggesting that the alleged modifications reside in the n-terminal half of rai <dig> 

we evaluated the transcription factor activity for the truncated products by subcloning the three mutant forms cdna into the pcmv-bd vector and posterior transfection of each clone plus the reporter gene into neuro-2a cells. forty eight hours post-transfection the cells were lysed and the activity of the luciferase reporter gene was measured. as can be seen in figure 2c, all truncated proteins gave an increment of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  ,  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  , and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  , in percentage of activation in comparison with the 100% of the wild type, indicating that the truncated polypeptides retained the transcription factor activity. all the truncated proteins showed a significant increased percentage of transcription activation when compared to the wild type protein . the following step was to evaluate the subcellular localization of the truncated fragments in the absence of the gal4-binding domain since the presence of this domain is enough to localize any protein to the nucleus  <cit> . the resulting truncated polypeptides would not include the hypothetical nuclear localization signals . cytoplasmatic subcellular localization was found for all the

rai1-ha 2687delc, rai1-ha 3103delc and rai <dig> r960x polypeptides . all together these results indicate that rai1-ha 2687delc, rai1-ha 3103delc and rai <dig> r960x are generating truncated polypeptides that retain the transcription factor activity. however, they are not localized in the nucleus but in the cytoplasm of cells.

nuclear localization signals are situated in the c-terminus of the human rai <dig> protein
in order to verify that the c-terminal portion of the rai <dig> protein is the one retaining the nuclear localization signals we generated two different fragments, one beginning at met  <dig> and the other beginning at met  <dig> of the rai <dig> protein. the difference between them contains the sequence that was assigned as the bipartite nls by in silico methods  <cit> . both c-terminal halves were generated as described in material and methods . in order to determine the molecular weight of the resulting proteins, both clones were transiently transfected, and  <dig> h post-transfection the cell lysate was run in a 10% sds-page gel. as can be observed in figure 3b, the molecular weight of both truncated proteins was ~ <dig> kda and  <dig> kda respectively as predicted; and interestingly these results differ from those obtained with the other proteins analyzed further supporting the possibility of a specific ptm in the n-terminal half of rai <dig>  we evaluated the transcription factor activity for the c-terminal halves of rai <dig> by subcloning them into the pcmv-bd vector with posterior transfection of each clone plus the reporter gene into neuro-2a cells. as can be seen in figure 3c, both c-terminal halves of rai <dig> were unable to activate the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene, since no luciferase activity could be measured in any of the assays. to evaluate the subcellular localization of the truncated fragments, both halves were transfected into neuro-2a cells and the subcellular localization assayed with anti ha antibody. as can be observed, both halves were found in the nucleus suggesting the presence of extra nls . altogether these results indicate that the n-terminal region of the human protein has the transcription factor activity and it is in the c-terminal half that the nuclear localization signaling resides.

no alterations were found for rai <dig> q1562r and rai <dig> s1808n mutants
as we mentioned earlier, there are only rare cases with patients with smith-magenis syndrome associated with heterozygous missense mutations in the rai <dig> coding region. in two of these cases, a missense mutation was found: rai <dig> q1562r and rai <dig> s1808n  <cit> . in order to investigate if these mutations were affecting the stability, subcellular localization or transcription activity function of the rai <dig> protein we generated both mutations as described in material and methods . to determine the molecular weight of the resulting proteins, both clones were transiently transfected, and  <dig> h post-transfection the cell lysate was run in a 10% sds-page gel. as can be observed in figure 4b, the molecular weight of both proteins is ~ <dig> kda similar to the wild type protein. moreover, none of the mutations seem to give the protein any instability, since the relative signal for both mutants and the wild type rai <dig> protein utilizing β-tubulin as loading control protein is the same for all of them. although there could be differences between transfection efficiency of the samples, we have found by densitometric analysis of bands from different western blots , that the ratio rai1/β-tubulin is the same for wild type, rai1-ha q1562r and rai1-ha s1808n  .

for both mutants we evaluated the transcription factor activity, in the same way that was previously done for the other proteins. as can be seen in figure 4c, both rai1-ha q1562r and rai1-ha s1808n mutated proteins can give an increment of  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  percentage of activation of luciferase activity respectively, when compared with the wild type as 100%. this is similar to what was found for the wild type rai1-ha protein, indicating that the mutated polypeptides retained the transcription factor activity. we next evaluated the subcellular localization of the mutated proteins, and nuclear localization was found for both of them . all together these results indicate that rai <dig> q1562r and rai <dig> s1808n mutations are not affecting the stability, transcription factor activity or subcellular localization of the protein.

discussion
alterations in the rai <dig> gene have been associated with smith-magenis and potocki-lupski syndromes whose clinical presentation includes autistic features, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, attention deficit, developmental delay, mental retardation, eeg abnormalities, sleep disturbances, self-injurious and maladaptive behaviors, among others  <cit> . in addition to this, rai <dig> gene was associated with spinocerebellar ataxia   <cit> , neuroleptic response in patients with schizophrenia  <cit> , neurobehavioral traits manifested in sms patients with rai <dig> loss-of-function alleles  <cit>  and non syndromic autism  <cit> . despite its relationship with these important traits, there is lack of information about the molecular function of human rai <dig> 

several heterozygous nucleotide variations in rai <dig> gene have been found in sms patients without 17p <dig>  deletions. these mutations include nonsense and missense mutations besides deletions of one or multiple nucleotides  <cit> .

within the rai <dig> gene coding sequence there are several mononucleotide repeats. intriguingly all five single base pair frameshift mutations found in the rai <dig> gene associated with the sms phenotype were in the c-tracts although the number of g-tracts in the rai <dig> coding region is comparable with the c-tracts  <cit> . interestingly, in our laboratory a spontaneous deletion of a c in a four c-tract at the position  <dig> occurred, providing further evidence that polyc-tract may be a preferential target for frameshift mutations in rai <dig> 

here we generated and studied the full-length cdna of human wild type rai <dig> and five mutated forms of the protein. four of them previously associated with sms. as deletions appear to be a very frequent event in the rai <dig> coding region, we also included in this study the spontaneously generated 2687delc. in order to complement these studies, we have constructed two smaller proteins corresponding to the residues 1038- <dig> and 1229- <dig> 

it was previously reported that mouse rai <dig> has moderate transactivational activity in hela cells  <cit> . here we confirmed those previous findings and showed that rai <dig> has a stronger transactivation activity in neuro-2a cells, the neuronal derived cell line. these results suggest specificity in the transcription machinery that rai <dig> could be part of and further indicate the importance of its role in neuronal derived tissues, since rai <dig> is a dosage sensitive gene involved in neurobehavioral phenotypes.

here we report that the wild type human rai <dig> protein has transcription factor activity. our studies of truncated proteins associated with 2687delc and 3103delc frameshifts plus r960x mutant, showed transcription factor activity significantly higher than the wild type protein for the resulting polypeptides. moreover, the analysis of the two smaller proteins corresponding to the residues 1038- <dig> and 1229- <dig> showed no capability of activating transcription themselves. according to our results, the human rai <dig> showed that the most important region of the protein for stimulating transcription is the n-terminal half, until residue  <dig>  from the residue  <dig> to the end of rai <dig> a fragment able to regulate the transactivational activity of the protein or the machinery associated may be present, since all truncated proteins showed a significant increase in transcription activity when compared to the full-length protein. in the n-terminal region, corresponding approximately to the first half of the protein, there is a homology of ~84% between human and murine rai <dig>  for the murine rai <dig> protein, putative transactivation domains were mapped by fusion of different regions to gal4-bd  <cit> . the polypeptides containing residues 1- <dig> or encompassing residues  <dig> to  <dig> have been shown to have transactivation activity while no transactivation activity was found in the region containing the remaining half; consistent with what is reported here for the human protein.

by bioinformatics analysis two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals  were defined for rai <dig> at positions  <dig> and  <dig> aa respectively  <cit> . despite that we cannot discard the participation of the previously described nls in the nuclear localization of the rai <dig> protein, our results indicate that there is a nuclear localization signal that resides between  <dig> aa to the end since the two smaller proteins 1038- <dig> and 1229- <dig> were able to localize in the nucleus; while the two n-terminal polypeptides were retained in the cytoplasm. these results suggest the presence of another fragment within the c-terminal half of rai <dig> that modulates the nuclear localization of the protein. accordingly, in vitro studies of the murine rai <dig> protein indicated that it can be transported to the nucleus and that the nuclear localization signals reside between the 1134- <dig> and 1203- <dig> aa. besides, on the c-terminal half of rai <dig> there are other regions that are also able to transport the protein to the nucleus  <cit> .

taking these results together, we can define two clear domains in rai1: an n-terminal half critical for its transactivational activity and a c-terminal half responsible for its nuclear transportation. in addition, to the c-terminus of both human and mouse rai <dig>  a zinc finger like plant homeo domain , which is also present in the trithorax family of chromatin remodeling transcriptional regulators was defined  <cit> . all these different domains are depicted in figure  <dig> 

the truncated proteins generated by mutations 2687delc, 3103delc and r960x showed to be functional and moreover, they have an increased capability for activating the transcription when compared to the wild type protein. however, none of the resulting polypeptides were able to localize in the nucleus, suggesting that this inability  would be the main pathological way of action for these mutations.

finally, there are spare cases of sms patients with mutations in the rai <dig> gene. we generated two independent mutations, rai <dig> q1562r and rai <dig> s1808n. no abnormal molecular weight, subcellular localization or transcription factor activity were found for any of these mutants, suggesting that they may be implicated in the association with other proteins or some other functional role of rai <dig> that is not known to date.

CONCLUSIONS
we were able to demonstrate that the human wild type protein has transcription factor activity, and is able to localize to the nucleus. moreover, we could define a transcription factor domain within the first  <dig> aa and that the nuclear localization signals reside in the second half the protein. altogether the analysis of the mutant proteins indicates that both halves are necessary for the correct subcellular localization and function of the protein, and that other molecular/functional role of rai <dig> remains unknown.
