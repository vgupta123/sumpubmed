BACKGROUND
cytolethal distending toxin  was discovered in an escherichia coli strain isolated from diarrheal patient in 1987
 <cit> . since then, expression of cdt has been reported from a variety of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, including aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., escherichia albertii, haemophilus ducreyi, helicobacter spp., providencia alcalifaciens, and shigella spp.
 <cit> .

the cdt operon contains three adjacent genes, cdta, cdtb and cdtc, and expression of all the genes is necessary for maximum toxin activity. while cdtb acts as an active subunit with dnase i activity, cdta and cdtc facilitate binding of cdt to a yet-to-be-identified receptor molecule on susceptible cells and entry of cdtb into the cytoplasm. as a result, cdt induces distention and eventual death of certain cultured eukaryotic cell lines by causing an irreversible arrest of the cell cycle at the g <dig> or g <dig> phase
 <cit> .

in cdt-producing e. coli , five subtypes of cdt  have been reported based on the amino acid sequences and the genomic location of their genes
 <cit> . although ctec strains have been isolated from children with diarrhea
 <cit> , case control studies conducted in children up to  <dig> years of age in brazil 
 <cit> , bangladesh 
 <cit>  and nigeria 
 <cit>  failed to demonstrate significant association of ctec with acute diarrhea. however, animal experiments with recombinant cdt of shigella dysenteriae and campylobacter jejuni cdt knockout mutants indicated that cdt is involved in diarrhea and inflammatory response
 <cit> . moreover, pandey et al.
 <cit>  reported that high titer cdt-i-producing enteropathogenic e. coli  were isolated from patients with bloody diarrhea in india while low titer producers were isolated from patients with acute watery diarrhea. we also demonstrated that an e. coli strain isolated from a child with bloody diarrhea in japan, which was initially suspected to be shiga toxin-producing e. coli , did not possess the stx genes rather it produced cdt-i by a retrospective analysis
 <cit> . furthermore, we have recently reported presence of various subtypes of the cdtb  genes in diarrheal stool specimens of children at a high rate . moreover, out of  <dig> ctec isolates, which produced any of the  <dig> subtypes of cdt ,  <dig> were isolated as a sole pathogen
 <cit>  suggesting possible association of ctec with diarrhea in children.

e. coli normally resides in the intestine of warm-blooded animals which are suspected to be the reservoir and possible source of human infection of pathogenic e. coli. for example, major natural reservoirs for stec, one of the most important groups of food-borne pathogens, have been established to be domestic ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats
 <cit> . during the processing of carcasses, fecal contamination or transfer of bacteria from animal’s skin to the carcass can facilitate transmission of stec to the meat
 <cit> . indeed, on a number of occasions, ctec also have been isolated from various farm animals
 <cit> , and these were associated with diseased animal.

in this study, we attempted to detect cdtb gene in stool specimens of apparently healthy domestic animals including cattle, swine and chickens from nara prefecture in japan. we further isolated and characterized ctec strains from these farm animals by serotyping, phylogenetic grouping and virulence gene profiling and compared with the strains of human origin.

RESULTS
detection and isolation of cdtb gene-positive bacteria
for analyzing the presence of ctec in healthy farm animals,  <dig> stool specimens collected from cattle in a farm and  <dig> rectal swabs collected from swine and chickens in another farm were subjected to pcr-rflp analysis which can specifically amplify so far known e. coli cdtb genes followed by subtyping them as cdt-i to cdt-v based on restriction site polymorphism. as shown in table
 <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> samples from cattle and swine, respectively, produced a 588-bp long pcr fragment containing the cdtb gene, while no pcr product was obtained using samples of chicken origin. the  <dig> cdtb gene-positive amplicons obtained from cattle stools were found to be comprised of  <dig> cdt-i,  <dig> cdt-iii/v and  <dig> cdt-iv. although same number of bacterial strains carrying the cdt-i and cdt-iv genes was successfully recovered, in the case of cdt-iii/v,  <dig> bacterial isolates were obtained out of  <dig> pcr-positive cases. similarly, the  <dig> amplicons derived from swine samples were identified as  <dig> cdt-ii and  <dig> cdt-iii/v. analysis of bacterial cells allowed us to recover  <dig> and  <dig>  as cdt-ii and cdt-iii/v, respectively . the cdtb-positive isolates were confirmed to carry cdta, cdtb and cdtc genes by colony hybridization using corresponding gene probes .

discrimination of cdt-iii/v-positive bacteria
we attempted to further discriminate cdt-iii/v-positive bacteria by type-specific pcr assays as reported previously
 <cit> . however, the type-specific pcr failed to differentiate cdt-iii and cdt-v genes in  <dig> cdt-v gene-positive e. coli  out:h <dig>   <dig> both cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive e. coli  of cattle, and  <dig> ctec-v o98:h <dig> and  <dig> out:hut of swine as indicated by asterisk in table
 <dig>  therefore we developed new type-specific pcr primers for cdt-iii and cdt-v genes in this study as shown in figure
 <dig>  using these primers all cdt-iii/v positive isolates were clearly differentiated according to the subtypes of cdt, except for one isolate in which both cdt-iii and cdt-v genes were detected as given in table
 <dig>  finally, among  <dig> cdtb gene-positive isolates of cattle origin,  <dig> were found to harbor cdt-i,  <dig> cdt-iii,  <dig> cdt-iv,  <dig> cdt-v and  <dig> both cdt-iii and cdt-v, whereas  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> cdtb gene-positive isolates from swine contained cdt-ii and cdt-v, respectively.

identification of ctec
all cdtb gene-positive isolates from cattle and swine were confirmed as e. coli by biochemical tests except for a cdt-ii gene-positive strain from swine . by api 20e testing, the strain sw- <dig> was identified as e. coli  with a doubtful api profile of  <dig> . however, unlike typical e. coli, strain sw- <dig> was nonmotile at 37°c and indole-negative, did not ferment lactose and sucrose, and did not produce β-glucuronidase. partial 16s rrna gene sequence of strain sw- <dig> was identical  to that of e. albertii , but also highly similar to those of shigella boydii  and e. coli . sugar utilization tests of dulcitol, d-mannitol, d-melibiose, l-rhamnose and d-xylose also suggested that strain sw- <dig> was e. albertii and not as e. coli <cit> . multilocus sequence  analysis based on the nucleotide sequence variation at  <dig> housekeeping loci  in the genome revealed that strain sw- <dig> belongs to the e. albertii lineage , consistent with the data of biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequencing. considering these findings together, the strain sw- <dig> was identified as e. albertii.

serotyping and phylogenetic grouping
to characterize the ctec strains further, their serotype and phylogenetic groups were determined . the  <dig> cattle isolates were grouped into  <dig> different o serogroups and  <dig> o:h serotypes. two cdt-i gene-positive e. coli  isolates were identified as o112ac:h <dig>  and out:h <dig> , respectively. three cdt-iii gene-positive e. coli  isolates were identified as o2:hut ,  <dig> as out  and  <dig> out , whereas one each of the  <dig> ctec-iii isolates belonged to serotype o2:nm , o7:h <dig> , o88:h <dig> , o88:h <dig> , and o88:h <dig> , respectively. one cdt-iv gene-positive e. coli  isolate was identified as o169:h <dig> . the ctec-v isolates belonged to divergent serotypes and phylogenetic groups, including o2:h <dig> , o8:hut , o22:h <dig> , o22:hut , o113:h <dig> , o113:nm , o118:nm , o154:h <dig> , o156:hut , o163:hut  and out , as shown in table
 <dig>  one isolate which was positive for both cdt-iii and cdt-v genes was identified as o2:hut . five and one ctec-v isolates from swine were identified as o98:h <dig>  and out:hut , respectively. interestingly, the e. albertii strain sw- <dig> showed cross reaction with the e. coli o <dig> antiserum.

virulence gene profile
to analyze the virulence gene profile of the ctec and e. albertii strains isolated in this study, genes for dec, ntec and putative adhesins reported in stec  were investigated by colony hybridization assays . in agreement with the previous report
 <cit> , all the ctec-iii strains possessed the cnf <dig> gene, indicating that cdt-iii of these strains could be located on pvir-like plasmid. surprisingly,  <dig> of the ctec-v strains also possessed cnf <dig> 

the eaea gene that encodes an outer membrane protein called intimin, which is necessary for intimate attachment of epec and ehec strains to epithelial cells, was detected in the e. albertii strain sw- <dig> from swine and all of the  <dig> ctec-v o156:hut  strains from cattle . the intimin subtype of three ctec-v o <dig> strains was determined as θ/γ <dig> by pcr-rflp, but the amplicon was not obtained in e. albertii strain sw- <dig>  sixteen ctec-v isolates  were positive for the stx <dig> and stx <dig> genes, while  <dig> ctec-v strains  were positive for only stx <dig>  cytotoxicity assay using vero and cho cells, which are susceptible and unsusceptible to stx intoxication, respectively, indicated that all the stx gene-positive ctec strains produced functional stx  and cdt  . however,  <dig> strains caused unexpected morphological change to cho cells, indicating that these strains might produce a third toxin. since the observed morphological change resembled to that induced by subab, an ab <dig> toxin discovered in lee-negative stec
 <cit> , the  <dig> strains were subjected to pcr analysis specific to the suba and subb genes and all the strains were positive for both the genes. collectively, these data indicate that the  <dig> e. coli strains produced cdt-v, stx and subab toxins.

stx gene-positive ctec strains harbored the putative adhesin genes of stec such as saa, lpfa
o113
, ehaa and iha, among which lpfa
o113
 and ehaa may be linked with long-term persistence in cattle
 <cit> , taguchi et al. unpublished]. in addition,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the ctec-iii isolates from cattle and  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the ctec-v isolates also harbored the lpfa
o113
 and ehaa genes, respectively . all the  <dig> ctec-v strains from swine also harbored both of the lpfa
o113
 and ehaa genes.

sequencing of the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes
to confirm the cdt subtyping, a total of  <dig> strains were selected and subjected to cdt-gene sequencing as shown in table
 <dig>  including  <dig> cnf2-positive ctec-v strains,  <dig> strains which were negative in cdt-v-specific pcr using p2-a <dig> and cdta-f, and cdtc-f and p2-c <dig> primer sets , ctec-iii and v, a ctec-v strain from swine, and  <dig> additional strains randomly selected from bovine ctec-v strains. strains bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig> and bv- <dig> were found to contain the identical  cdt-v genes to those in human clinical strains 9282/ <dig> , 5249/ <dig> , and ah- <dig> . the cdt-v genes in strains bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig>  bv- <dig> and bv- <dig> also showed high sequence similarity  to the cdt-v genes . the cdt-iii genes in the strain bv- <dig> were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % identical to the cdt-iii , cdt-v  and cdt-ii  genes, respectively, whereas the cdt-v genes in the same strain were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % identical to cdt-v, cdt-iii and cdt-ii, respectively. p <dig> phage-related sequence was found in the flanking sequences of all the cdt-v genes examined. the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes in strain bv- <dig> were  <dig> % identical to each other. strain bv- <dig> may have both cdt-iii genes located on the pvir-like plasmid encoding cnf <dig> and cdt-v genes located on bacteriophage.

although cdtb  and cdtc  in the strain sw- <dig> were highly homologous to those of cdt-v , the cdta was most homologous to that of s. boydii cdt , followed by e. albertii cdt , cdt-ii , cdt-v  and cdt-iii . the cdta genes in other ctec-v strains sw- <dig>  sw- <dig>  sw- <dig>  sw- <dig> and sw- <dig> were also identical to that of strain sw- <dig>  these data suggest that the ctec-v from swine in this study might harbor chimeric cdt genes consisting of sbcdt-a or eacdt-a, cdt-vb and cdt-vc.

discussion
clinical importance of ctec in humans including intestinal and extra-intestinal infections is not yet fully understood. several studies, however, showed that on several occasions ctec strains were isolated from patients with diarrhea, septicemia, or urinary tract infection
 <cit> , suggesting that ctec might be associated with human diseases. to understand the possible reservoir and potential source of ctec infection, we have screened feces of healthy farm animals  for the presence of e. coli cdtb gene by a pcr-rflp assay, which can detect and differentiate  <dig> subtypes of the e. coli cdtb gene
 <cit> . in addition, we isolated ctec strains from the cdtb gene-positive samples and characterized them for serotypes, virulence gene profiles and phylogenetic groups to compare with those of ctec strains from diarrheal patients. there is a report regarding the isolation of cdt-v-producing e. coli o <dig> from healthy cattle by tóth et al.
 <cit> . in most of the previous studies, however, ctec strains were isolated from diseased animals with various symptoms
 <cit> . in this study, to avoid any bias, we have isolated ctec strains from cdtb-positive fecal sample of apparently healthy cattle and swine.

a total of  <dig> and  <dig> ctec strains have been isolated from  <dig> and  <dig> cdtb gene-positive fecal samples of cattle and swine, respectively . the  <dig> strains from cattle samples were grouped into  <dig> o serogroups and  <dig> o:h serotypes . in our previous work, we showed that ctec-i belonging to the o <dig> serogroup and b <dig> phylogenetic group was most predominant among the ctec strains isolated from children with diarrhea in japan
 <cit> . although  <dig> ctec strains belonged to the o <dig> serogroup and b <dig> phylogenetic group were isolated in this study, none of them were cdt-i producers . this may be because of different geographical background between clinical and animal samples collected. alternatively although cattle and swine carry a variety of ctec strains, all the ctec strains in cattle and swine may not be associated with human diseases. since all types of ctec have been isolated from patients with diarrhea, ctec strains found in cattle and swine in this study might be associated with human diseases in future. results obtained in this study indicate that further studies on prevalence of ctec in food animals in several farms and meats are needed.

tóth et al.
 <cit>  reported the isolation of cdt-v-producing e. coli o <dig> from healthy cattle in hungary. however, all the ctec strains isolated in the present study did not belong to o <dig> serogroup. it might be due to difference of the strategies. in their study, they tried to isolate only e. coli o <dig> from healthy cattle samples by using cefixime-tellurite-sorbitol-macconkey agar and also by following the international organization for standardization reference method  using an o157-specific immunomagnetic beads. on the other hand, we targeted ctec by using pcr-rflp for detection of all five subtypes of the e. coli cdtb gene. we further characterized only one strain from each cdtb gene-positive sample. thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that ctec o <dig> was present in our samples, but we could not isolate ctec o <dig> 

presence of the cdt-i and cdt-iv, and cdt-iii genes were reported to be strongly associated with that of the cnf <dig> and cnf <dig> genes, respectively
 <cit> . it has also been reported that the cdt-iii genes were located on a plasmid harboring the cnf <dig> gene
 <cit> , whereas cdt-v was chromosomal and carried by bacteriophage
 <cit> , suggesting that detection of the cnf <dig> gene could be one of the genetic markers to differentiate cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive strains. indeed, all the  <dig> strains with cdt-iii were also positive for cnf <dig>  however,  <dig> out of the  <dig> cdt-v gene-positive strains from cattle also contained cnf <dig> and this gene arrangement has not yet been reported. since homology between cdt-iii and cdt-v genes is very high 
 <cit> , it is difficult to differentiate the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes by pcr, suggesting that some of the cdt-iii and cdt-v genes might have been misidentified. in the present study, three pcr primer sets, cdt-iiiabc, cdt-vup, cdt-vdown, each targeting the internal region of cdt-iii <cit> , the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions of cdt-v <cit> , failed in producing specific amplicon in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> strains, respectively, out of the  <dig> ctec-v and  <dig> ctec-iii and v . however, the type-specific pcr developed in this study using two primer sets each targeting cdt-iii or cdt-v  could produce specific amplicon either for cdt-iii or cdt-v. the cdt-iii- and cdt-v-specific pcr designed in this study is more reliable to differentiate these genes and to generate more precise epidemiological data. in fact, using the type-specific pcr, we identified a both cdt-iii and cdt-v gene-positive e. coli strain. to our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the isolation of ctec-iii and v strain.

since reservoir for stec has been identified to be ruminant such as cattle and this study also indicates that reservoir for ctec could be the same, similar genes for adhesion might be associated with colonization of both stec and ctec. in addition to the eaea gene, saa, iha, lpfa
o113
 and ehaa genes have also been reported to encode putative adhesins in stec o <dig> and non-o157
 <cit> . recently wu et al.
 <cit>  described a probable association of these  <dig> genes, in particular lpfa
o113
 and ehaa genes, with the long-term stec shedding from cattle. when virulence gene profiling, in particular, for adhesin were analyzed in this study,  <dig> and 83% strains from cattle and swine, respectively, were found to be positive for lpfa
o113
 and ehaa genes, while 100% stx gene-positive ctec isolates were all positive for saa, lpfa
o113
, ehaa and iha genes. furthermore, almost all of them were positive for cdt-iii or cdt-v whereas  <dig> strains were positive for cdt-i genes. in this study, 97% of cdt genes detected in the feces of cattle was cdt-iii or cdt-v whereas only  <dig> and 1% of cdt genes were cdt-i and cdt-iv, respectively. clark et al.
 <cit>  also reported that the cdt-iii genotype was more prevalent in animal strains although the majority of cdt genotypes isolated from humans was cdt-i and cdt-iv <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that lpfao <dig> and ehaa could be associated with adhesion of ctec in cattle intestine, especially ctec-iii and ctec-v.

strain sw- <dig> initially identified as ctec-ii o84:nm by biochemical test was re-identified as e. albertii, a newly emerging diarrheagenic pathogen
 <cit> , by a mls analysis and sugar utilization tests. this may be the first report showing isolation of e. albertii from swine in japan. furthermore, this finding prompted us to reinvestigate if previously identified ctec-ii strains were of e. albertii or not. indeed the ctec-ii strain ah- <dig>  previously identified as out:nm
 <cit> , was found to be e. albertii . ooka et al.
 <cit>  recently reported that  <dig> out of  <dig> eaea gene-positive e. coli strains, isolated from humans, birds and the environment in japan, were identified as e. albertii by mls analysis and cdtb gene of cdt-ii/iii/v subtypes group was detected by pcr in all the e. albertii strains except  <dig> strain. epec isolates, previously identified as e. coli o86:k <dig> and contained the cdtb gene, were also identified as e. albertii <cit> . the cdt genes of e. albertii strain  <dig>  are highly homologous to the cdt-ii genes present in e. coli strains. these data suggest that e. albertii might have been misidentified as not only epec but also ctec-ii. since there is no reliable method to identify e. albertii other than mls analysis to date, the development of simple and reliable identification method of e. albertii is required. the cdt-ii genes could be one of useful genetic markers for this purpose although discrimination of e. albertii from true ctec-ii is still necessary.

CONCLUSIONS
we could isolate a number of ctec strains from cattle and swine, which had diverse variations in serotype and genotype. some of the ctec strains possessed virulence genes associated with human diseases and serotype that are frequently detected among human clinical strains. thus, cattle and swine could be possible reservoirs of ctec and serve as potential sources of infection to human. to the best of our knowledge, this might be the first report regarding comprehensive surveillance and characterization of ctec strains isolated from healthy food animals. because of the limited number of animals and farms examined, further studies are of course needed to verify the probability that these animals are indeed the source of ctec infection to humans.
