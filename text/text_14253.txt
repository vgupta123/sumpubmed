BACKGROUND
juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis , or batten disease, is a recessively inherited childhood-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive blindness, seizures, motor and cognitive decline, and early death  <cit> . the primary genetic defect  leading to jncl is a  <dig>  kb genomic dna deletion in the cln <dig> gene, which eliminates exons  <dig> and  <dig> and surrounding intronic dna, predicting a non-functional protein product  <cit> .

the pathological hallmark of jncl is autofluorescent ceroid lipofuscin deposits within autolysosomes that are enriched in subunit c of the mitochondrial atp synthase complex  <cit> . remarkably, these deposits are not only found in cns neurons but are also abundant in non-neuronal cells outside of the nervous system. the relationship of subunit c deposits to the jncl disease process, and the underlying reason for the neuronal specificity of the disease remain poorly understood.

the cln3-encoded protein  is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed, multi-pass membrane protein  <cit>  that localizes to the lysosome and other vesicular compartments  <cit> . battenin function remains to be elucidated, although studies of btn <dig>  the yeast cln <dig> ortholog, have implicated battenin in lysosomal ph homeostasis and amino acid transport  <cit> .

to explore jncl pathogenesis and battenin function, we previously generated a genetically precise jncl mouse model. cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice harbor the ~ <dig> kb common jncl mutation and express a non-truncated mutant battenin isoform that is detectable with antibodies recognizing c-terminal epitopes. homozygous cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice exhibit a progressive jncl-like disease, with perinatal onset of subunit c deposition in many cell types and later onset of neuronal dysfunction and behavioral deficits  <cit> . these findings suggest that the major jncl defect leads to abnormal turnover of mitochondrial subunit c, in a manner that selectively compromises cns neurons.

currently, there is no suitable neuronal cell system to investigate the impact of the common jncl mutation on biological processes. therefore, we have established cerebellar neuronal precursor cell lines from cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice. homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells exhibit pathological hallmarks of the disease, and a survey of membrane organelles revealed membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction in homozygous mutant cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells.

RESULTS
generation of a genetically precise cerebellar jncl cell model
to generate a precise genetic, neuron-derived jncl cell culture system, we immortalized granule neurons cultured from postnatal day  <dig>  cerebella of homozygous and heterozygous cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice, and wild-type littermates. primary cell cultures enriched for granule neurons were transduced with retroviral vector bearing a selection cassette and temperature-sensitive tsa <dig> sv <dig> large t antigen. growth in g <dig> containing medium at the permissive temperature  allowed for selection and isolation of multiple clonal nestin-positive , and gfap-negative , cell lines for each genotype. no genotype specific differences were observed in cellular morphology or doubling time  . as expected, sv <dig> large t antigen expression was rapidly lost and cell division ceased when cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature  . upon addition of neuronal differentiation cocktail, precursor cells became neuron-like in morphology and exhibited decreased nestin expression  and increased map <dig> and neun expression , but not expression of the purkinje marker, calbindin .

homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells express mutant battenin and display jncl-like pathology
homozygous cb cln3Δex7/ <dig> cells were first examined for jncl-like characteristics. homozygous cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice express multiple cln <dig> mrna splice variants and mutant battenin protein that is detectable by batp <dig> antibody recognizing c-terminal epitopes  <cit> . to assess this molecular phenotype in cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, rt-pcr and anti-battenin  immunostaining were performed. as shown in figure  <dig>  cln <dig> mrna isoforms in wild-type and homozygous cells were similar to those observed in total rna isolated from wild-type or homozygous cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in brain, respectively . in addition, batp <dig> immunostaining detected mutant battenin product in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, in a similar albeit reduced cytoplasmic, vesicular staining pattern as that seen in wild-type cells. batp <dig> signal exhibited some overlap with the lysosomal marker, lamp <dig>  but had more significant overlap with early endosome antigen  <dig>  and the late endosomal marker, rab <dig> . only limited overlap was observed with recycling endosomes, as determined by transferrin receptor co-staining . intriguingly, lamp <dig> and eea <dig> immunocytochemical distribution were altered in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, with less perinuclear clustering than in wild-type cells, and rab <dig> staining was frequently less intense in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells . heterozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells contained a mixture of cln <dig> mrna products from both the wild-type allele and the mutant allele, and batp <dig> signal was similar to that seen in wild-type cells .

during sub-confluent growth conditions, neither wild-type nor homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells displayed autofluorescence or subunit c inclusion formation . however, when cells were aged at confluency , homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cellular subunit c levels were elevated beyond normal wild-type levels by immunostaining  and immunoblot analysis . autofluorescent signal sometimes overlapped with subunit c signal, but also was elevated more diffusely . moreover, although multilamellar "fingerprint" profiles were not detected, confluency-aged homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells displayed numerous ultrastructural abnormalities including electron dense inclusions characteristic of lipofuscin and large autophagosomes that contained dense core structures, degenerating mitochondria, and many smaller vesicles . inclusion bodies and autophagosomes were infrequently observed in confluency-aged wild-type cultures .

homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells and cln3Δex7/ <dig> knock-in mice process cathepsin d abnormally
we next investigated the basis for subunit c accumulation, testing the hypothesis that cathepsin d is abnormal since it is required for atp synthase subunit c degradation in the lysosome  <cit> . we first tested cathepsin d transport and processing in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells and cln3Δex7/ <dig> mice using anti-cathepsin d antibody that recognizes unprocessed and processed cathepsin d isoforms. immunostaining of wild-type and homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells revealed a perinuclear and punctate vesicular cathepsin d distribution, consistent with its transport and processing through the secretory pathway and delivery to the lysosome . however, in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, cathepsin d distribution was less vesicular and more perinuclear-clustered than in wild-type cells. immunoblots of homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cell and cln3Δex7/ <dig> tissue extracts also showed altered relative levels of cathepsin d isoforms . cathepsin d isoforms, identified by relative molecular weights, represent the ~ <dig> kda precursor, the ~ <dig> kda intermediate single chain form of the enzyme, and the  <dig> kda heavy chain of the double-chain form of the mature enzyme  <cit> . in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cell and cln3Δex7/ <dig> tissue extracts, the precursor and heavy chains were reduced, and the single chain was slightly elevated compared to wild-type extracts. the cellular growth media did not contain altered levels of cathepsin d, indicating enzyme secretion was not affected. heterozygous cln3Δex7/ <dig> mice and cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells were indistinguishable from wild-type, as expected for a recessive disease phenotype .

the impact of the altered cathepsin d processing on enzymatic activity was next tested to determine if altered enzymatic activity accounts for inefficient subunit c turnover. in a fluorogenic in vitro assay, cathepsin d activity in total cellular extracts was not significantly altered in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells , versus wild-type cells , although a consistent trend towards increased enzymatic activity in mutant cells was observed. thus, cathepsin d transport and processing are disrupted in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells in a manner such that enzymatic activity appears to be relatively unaffected.

homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells show abnormal membrane organelles
the abnormal transport and processing of cathepsin d suggested membrane trafficking disruptions in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells; therefore, we surveyed the subcellular distribution and morphology of membrane organelles. components of the secretory pathway, including the er, cis-golgi, and trans-golgi, did not appear altered from wild-type appearance when labeled with the respective markers, protein disulfide isomerase , gm <dig>  and vvl . by contrast, the lysosomal markers, lysotracker and lamp  <dig> had significantly altered signal in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, versus wild-type cells. wild-type cells exhibited brightly stained lysosomes that were large and clustered in the perinuclear region whereas homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> lysosomes were lightly stained, smaller vesicles that were more diffusely scattered in the cytoplasm of the cell . lamp  <dig> distribution was also altered, as previously noted . however, lamp  <dig> and lamp  <dig> total protein levels were similar in wild-type and homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells by immunoblot analysis, indicating the altered signal likely reflects dispersed lysosomes or altered localization and/or epitope availability . it is noteworthy that lysotracker dye, which selectively accumulates in acidic compartments, exhibited the most marked reduction in lysosomal labeling. this observation may reflect altered lysosomal ph, an established finding in jncl  <cit> .

consistent with the altered early endosome marker  signal observed by immunostaining , fluid-phase endocytosis was also altered in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, as measured by dextran-fitc uptake . following a 15-minute incubation in media containing dextran-fitc, wild-type and heterozygote cells displayed brightly stained, large endocytic vesicles that were clustered in the perinuclear region. however, homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells were less brightly stained with most dextran-fitc signal localizing to smaller vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the cell.

finally, because subunit c is a mitochondrial protein and its turnover proceeds through autophagic engulfment of mitochondria  <cit> , we analyzed homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cell mitochondrial morphology and function. mitochondrial distribution in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells was indistinguishable from wild-type and heterozygous cells; however, homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> mitochondria appeared more elongated by grp <dig> marker immunostaining and tem analysis . 72% of homozygous mutant mitochondria were greater than  <dig>  μm in length , while fewer wild-type mitochondria  reached this length . mitochondrial width was not altered in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells . moreover, compared to wild-type or heterozygous cells, homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells had significantly reduced cellular atp levels  and exhibited reduced survival following hydrogen peroxide treatment , suggesting impaired energy metabolism and oxidative stress response. taken together, these data support impaired mitochondrial function in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells.

discussion
cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cerebellar precursor cells represent the first genetically accurate neuron-derived culture model of jncl. homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells express mutant battenin and jncl-hallmark mitochondrial atpase subunit c accumulation, upon aging of cells at confluency. moreover, this is the first study to indicate recessive endosomal/lysosomal membrane trafficking defects and mitochondrial dysfunction that precedes subunit c deposition in an accurate jncl model. importantly, these defects are likely to be early events in the jncl disease process and may particularly impact neuronal function.

abnormal cathepsin d localization and processing in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells and cln3Δex7/ <dig> mice likely reflects altered vesicular trafficking and/or lysosomal ph, which is known to impact cathepsin d processing  <cit> . indeed, cln <dig> overexpression in hek- <dig> cells altered lysosomal ph and cathepsin d processing  <cit> , and lysosomal ph homeostasis is disrupted in jncl  <cit> . it is noteworthy that cathepsin b and the cln2-encoded enzyme, tppi, are also altered in jncl  <cit> . nevertheless, despite the cathepsin d protein alterations that are observed in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, cathepsin d enzymatic activity does not appear to be reduced. thus, decreased cathepsin d activity is unlikely to account for subunit c accumulation in jncl.

aging of homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells at confluency is necessary to induce significantly accumulated subunit c protein. however, membrane organelle disruptions precede subunit c accumulation in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells, since they are observed without aging at confluency. lysosomal and endosomal size and distribution are altered, and mitochondria are abnormally elongated and functionally compromised in sub-confluent homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cultures. these observations argue that membrane trafficking defects do not result from excessive subunit c accumulation compromising the lysosome, but rather are early events in the disease process preceding subunit c accumulation. mitochondrial abnormalities, which have also been reported in jncl patients and other animal models  <cit> , may result from ineffective turnover by autophagy, a lysosomal-targeted pathway  <cit> . alternatively, or simultaneously, battenin deficiency may impact mitochondrial function upstream of turnover, affecting mitochondrial biogenesis and/or altered transport and processing of mitochondrial proteins.

in wild-type cbcln <dig> neuronal precursor cells battenin primarily co-localizes with early and late endosomes. battenin immunostaining in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> neuronal precursors is significantly reduced in abundance, but mutant signal also co-localizes with endosomal markers suggesting mutant battenin protein with c-terminal epitopes is trafficked similar to wild-type protein. in other studies, cln3/battenin protein localization has been reported to partially overlap with late endosomes and lysosomes in non-neuronal cells  <cit> , and to lysosomes, synaptosomes  <cit>  and endosomes  <cit>  in neurons. these data jointly indicate that battenin resides in a subset of vesicular compartments linking multiple membrane trafficking pathways, perhaps functioning in vesicular transport and/or fusion. endocytic and lysosomal-targeted pathways, including mitochondrial autophagy, are specifically implicated in this study.

CONCLUSIONS
the membrane trafficking and mitochondrial deficits uncovered in homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cells are likely to particularly impact neuronal function. neurotransmission heavily relies on membrane vesicle transport, and a high-energy metabolism may further sensitize neurons to the loss of battenin activity. thus, our panel of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous cbcln3Δex7/ <dig> cerebellar cells provide an ideal model system to further elucidate battenin function and jncl pathogenesis.
