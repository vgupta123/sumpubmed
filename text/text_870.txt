BACKGROUND
β-lactam antibiotics are an important arsenal of agents used against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. resistance to this class of antimicrobials is therefore of immense clinical significance. it is important to investigate the epidemiology of strains that are resistant to β-lactam antibiotics especially in sub-saharan africa where treatment with alternative or more effective agents may be beyond the reach of majority of patients. before treatment using β-lactam antibiotics is initiated, proper and timely identification of the β-lactamase phenotype is of critical importance. failure or delay to do this may lead to therapeutic failure and death of patients  <cit> . in order to guide therapy and in order to understand the molecular epidemiology of β-lactamase-producers, a combination of susceptibility profiling, pcr and sequencing techniques may be required  <cit> . these techniques are not always available or affordable in resource-poor settings. therefore, the prevalence of β-lactamases in developing countries is largely undetermined and the use of β-lactam antibiotics in such countries remains largely empiric.

based on resistance to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor antibiotics, bacteria strains may be conveniently categorized into various resistant phenotypes  <cit> . strains exhibiting narrow spectrum β-lactamase phenotypes  normally produce tem- <dig> and/or shv- <dig> enzymes that effectively degrade penicillins but are susceptible to other classes of β-lactams  <cit> . however, mutations on the promoter region of the gene encoding tem- <dig> may result to over-production of these otherwise narrow-spectrum enzymes. this overproduction may in turn confer resistance to other classes of β-lactams besides penicillins  <cit> . point mutations on these enzymes may also generate inhibitor resistant enzymes such as the inhibitor resistant tems  that degrade penicillins but are not impeded by β-lactamase inhibitors such clavulanic acid or sulbactam  <cit> . extended spectrum β-lactamases  may also be derived from tem- and shv-type enzymes. esbls exhibit a wide hydrolytic ability to different generations of cephalosporins but remain susceptible to β-lactamase inhibitors  <cit> . complex mutant tems  are also derived from tem- <dig> or tem- <dig> and degrade most β-lactams but are susceptible to β-lactamase inhibitors including tazobactam. the cmts are also susceptible to cephamycins and carbapenems  <cit> . plasmid–encoded ampc  such as cmys mediate resistance to most classes of β-lactams except to fourth generation cephalosporins and carbapenems  <cit> . the β-lactamases with the worst clinical implications are those that degrade carbapenems, the most potent class of β-lactam antibiotics available today. some carbapenemases such as the klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases  degrade virtually all classes of β-lactams  <cit> . some carbapenemases such as metallo-β-lactamases  are however susceptible to aztreonam, a monobactam  <cit> . it is therefore clear that determination of β-lactamase phenotypes may not only aid the choice of agents to treat patients but may also guide the screening of bla genes and therefore save costs in surveillance studies. understanding molecular epidemiology of bla gene is also important because majority of broad-spectrum resistant enzymes, especially the esbls and cmys are encoded in conjugative plasmids that may be acquired across species barrier. therefore, such genes have a high potential for spread via horizontal gene transfer mechanisms  <cit> .

the phenotypic diversity of β-lactamase-producers in kenya is poorly described and the diversity of bla genes has not been properly investigated  <cit> . the aim of the current study was to determine the β-lactamase phenotypes and carriage of bla genes of critical importance in e. coli obtained from blood, stool and urine obtained from hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients seeking treatment in kenyan hospitals during an 18-year period .

RESULTS
phenotypic diversity of β-lactamase-producers
none of the  <dig> isolates tested in this study were resistant to carbapenems. cefepime, , cefoxitin , and piperacillin-tazobactam , were effective against majority  of these isolates. the nsbl-like phenotype was the most dominant phenotype in our collection and was observed in  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates compared to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of isolates found to exhibit irt-, esbl-, cmt and pampc-like phenotypes respectively, table  <dig>  based on resistance phenotypes,  <dig> esbl-producers fit into two sets. the first set comprised of  <dig> isolates exhibiting resistance to combinations of aztreonam and multiple cephalosporins including ceftazidime. the other set of  <dig> isolates were resistant to the same panel of antibiotics but not to ceftazidime. the  <dig> isolates with a cmt-like phenotype were resistant to all generations of cephalosporins but were susceptible to cephamycins and carbapenems. resistance to all β-lactamase inhibitors including tzp was observed in  <dig>  of the cmt-producers. among  <dig> isolates with a cmt-like phenotype that had intermediate resistance to tzp, tiny ghost zones  were observed between amoxicillin-clavulanic acid  and ceftazidime  and/or cefotaxime . these isolates therefore exhibited a combination of both esbl- and cmt-like phenotypes. the most resistant strains were those exhibiting a pampc-like phenotype. these  <dig> isolates comprising about 10% of all the isolates in our collection were resistant to most generations of cephalosporins and β-lactamase inhibitors including tzp but were susceptible to carbapenems.

resistance phenotypes of the  <dig> isolates investigated.

a: β-lactamase phenotypes observed in different isolates were defined as follow:- narrow spectrum β-lactamases  were resistant to penicillins but were susceptible to other classes of β-lactam antibiotics. isolates exhibiting the inhibitor resistant tem phenotype  were those capable of degrading penicillins, were not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors but were susceptible to other classes of β-lactam antibiotics. the esbl-producers were resistant to penicillins, 2nd and most 3rd generation cephalosporins, and exhibited intermediate resistance to 4th generation cephalosporins and were fully susceptible to cephamycins, carbapenems and β-lactamase inhibitors. the complex mutant tems  were resistant to most β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors including tzp but were susceptible to cephamycins and carbapenems. isolates with the pampc phenotypes were resistant to all generations of β-lactam antibiotics, were susceptible to carbapenems and were either susceptible or exhibited intermediate resistance to 4th generation cephalosporins.

distribution of β-lactamase-producers
all the β-lactamase phenotypes reported in this study were observed in isolates from all specimen-types obtained during the 1990s and 2000s and from both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, table  <dig>  while majority of isolates from stool exhibited the relatively susceptible nsbl-like phenotype, isolates from urine accounted for 55%, 53%, 57% and 72% of strains with complex resistances such as irt-, esbl-, cmt- and pampc-like phenotypes respectively. majority of isolates from hospitalized patients, especially those diagnosed with utis, exhibited such complex phenotypes compared to those obtained from patients seeking outpatient treatment. these complex resistances were also more common among isolates obtained in recent years .

carriage of bla genes
carriage of blatem- <dig> or blashv- <dig> was associated with the nsbl-like phenotype in 54% and 35% of the  <dig> isolates exhibiting this phenotype respectively. the two genes were also found together in 11% of the nsbl-producers, table  <dig>  the only irt-encoding gene identified in this study was blatem- <dig> that was detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig> isolates with an irt-like phenotype. the other  <dig>  of isolates with this phenotype carried a combination of blatem-1+blaoxa- <dig> genes. majority  of the  <dig> isolates with an esbl-like phenotype tested positive for ctx-m-type esbls. while blactx-m- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> were detected in 29% and 24% of these isolates respectively, blactx-m- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig>  blactx-m- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> were detected in lower frequencies of 6%, 11%, 2% and 4% respectively, table  <dig>  isolates which carried blactx-m- <dig> alone exhibited intermediate resistances to aztreonam and cefotaxime and were fully susceptible to ceftazidime. the blatem- <dig> that was detected in  <dig>  of esbl-producers was the only tem-type esbl identified in this study. the carriage and diversity of shv-type esbl genes was also low in which case, only blashv- <dig> and blashv- <dig> esbl-encoding genes were detected in 3% and 5% of the esbl-producers respectively. resistance to ceftazidime among the esbl-producers was attributed mainly to carriage of blactx-m- <dig> or a combination of blactx-ms + blaoxa-1 + blatem- <dig> genes. a significant proportion  of isolates containing blactx-ms or blashv-type esbls in the absence of blaoxa- <dig> or blatem- <dig> were susceptible to ceftazidime.

the blatem- <dig> was detected in 29% of the  <dig> isolates exhibiting a cmt-like phenotype and was therefore the most common cmt-encoding gene detected in this study. other cmt genes: - blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig>  blatem- <dig> and blatem- <dig> were detected in much lower prevalences of 8%, 7%, 11%, and 8% respectively, table  <dig>  carriage of cmt genes did not account for cmt-like phenotypes in 30% of isolates with this phenotype. nine of such isolates tested positive for a combination of blatem-14 + blaoxa-1+blatem- <dig> while  <dig> strains carried a combination of blatem-15 + blaoxa-1+blatem- <dig>  another  <dig> isolates tested positive for a combination of a blatem- <dig> , and blaoxa- <dig>  production of oxa- <dig> and tem- <dig> enzymes in the presence of ctx-m enzymes apparently masked the esbl-phenotype that is otherwise conferred by ctx-m enzymes. therefore, isolates producing a combination of such enzymes could hardly be distinguished from genuine cmt-producers. the blacmy- <dig> that was present in  <dig>  of all isolates in our collection was the most common pampc-encoding genes detected in this study. the cmys were also detected in strains co-producing tem- <dig> and shv-type esbls suggesting a possible co-evolution of penicillinases, esbls and ampcs genes in the same isolate. while majority of blaoxa- <dig> genes were detected in strains bearing esbl genes such as blactx-ms or blatem- <dig>  the blaoxa- <dig> were detected in strains carrying blacmys table  <dig>  none of the isolates investigated tested positive for bla-per-like, blaacc-like, blaveb-like, or bladha-like genes.

distribution of bla genes
we also analyzed for the distribution of bla genes among strains obtained from different specimen-types and among those obtained from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients, figure  <dig>  majority of bla genes were present in all specimen-types regardless of their clinical backgrounds. however, blactx-m- <dig> was only detected in isolates from urine while blatem- <dig> was not detected among isolates from blood. blatem- <dig> and blactx-m- <dig> on the other hand, were exclusively detected among isolates obtained from hospitalized patients. all bla genes described in this study were found in isolates obtained from both the 1990s and 2000s except blacmy- <dig> that was exclusively detected among isolates obtained during the 2000– <dig> period.

discussion
in this study, we describe the diversity of β-lactamase genes in a large collection of e. coli from different types of clinical specimen obtained from hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients in kenya. this study suggests that carbapenems and to a less extent, cefepime, cephamycins and piperacillin-tazobactam may still be potent against majority of the isolates investigated. although we do not rule out that the panel of bla genes in our strains is wider than what is reported in this study, there was a general agreement between phenotypic data and the panel of bla genes detected in the strains analysed. the diversity of bla genes encountered in isolates from blood, stool and urine specimen of hospitalized patients was almost identical to the panel of genes encountered in corresponding specimens from non-hospitalized patients. this partially suggests a possible exchange of strains between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients or a flow of genes among strains from different clinical backgrounds. based on the resistance profiles, we identify esbl-, cmt- and pampc-producers as the most important set of strains whose spread in hospital and community settings should be closely monitored. if the prevalence of isolates with such highly resistant strains continues to rise, majority of β-lactam antibiotics may cease to be effective agents for management of community- and hospital-acquired infections in kenya.

it is highly likely that heavy use of antibiotics to treat different infections, and urethral tract infections  in particular, has selected for isolates carrying multiple bla genes such as those encountered in this study. since the antibiotic-use policy is rarely enforced in kenya, and since most prescriptions are issued without culture and susceptibility data, β-lactam antibiotics are likely to be glossily misused. this may partially explain why complex phenotypes such as esbl-, cmt- and pampc-like phenotypes were observed even among isolates from stool. the current study also shows that 41% of the isolates were resistant to at least one β-lactamase inhibitor. high resistances to inhibitor antibiotics may emerge as a result of over-reliance on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid to treat different infections in kenya even without a valid prescription. it is however interesting to note that the prevalence of inhibitor resistant bla genes is still very low among strains exhibiting an irt-like phenotype. similar studies conducted in spain reported a similar low prevalence of irts  <cit> . the only true irt reported in this study was tem- <dig> while majority  of isolates with an irt-like phenotype carried a combination of blatem-1 + blaoxa- <dig>  these two genes were also frequently detected in isolates exhibiting a combination of an esbl- and cmt-like phenotypes. however, blaoxa- <dig> and blatem- <dig> were also detected in isolates susceptible to inhibitors. we speculate that besides conferring resistance to narrow spectrum penicillins, some tem- <dig> and oxa- <dig> may be implicated in resistance to other classes of antimicrobials such as various generations of cephalosporins and possibly, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. these hypothesis is partially based on findings from a recent study conducted in kenya that described novel blaoxa- <dig> enzymes in salmonella strains that contain promoter mutations that confer resistance to broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics including β-lactamase inhibitors  <cit> . furthermore, studies conducted elsewhere have also reported resistance to multiple β-lactam antibiotics due to promoter mutations that result to over-production of tem- <dig> enzymes  <cit> . it is therefore important to further investigate genetic basis of resistance and the role of these otherwise narrow-spectrum β-lactamases  in mediating resistance to advanced classes of β-lactam antibiotics in developing countries.

in the current study, we found a high diversity of cmts, yet these enzymes have been reported only in a few countries  <cit> . it is possible that the ease of access to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in kenya without valid susceptibility data has selected for strains with cmt genes that are rarely reported from other countries. in contrast, majority of ctx-m- and shv-type esbls and cmy-type pampcs genes identified are those with a global-like spread pattern  <cit> . similarly, tem- <dig>  the only tem-type esbl reported in this study, is frequently reported in usa  <cit>  and europe  <cit> . the wide dissemination of genes encoding these esbls and pampcs is attributed to physical association between these genes and mobile genetic elements such as isecp <dig>  transposons and conjugative plasmids  <cit> . such genetic affiliations further underline the potential of these genes described in this study to spread to susceptible strains through horizontal gene transfer mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates the need to combine phenotypic and molecular methods in order to understand important aspects of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in developing countries. we recommend that measures be put in place to minimize possible exchange of strains between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. prudent use of β-lactam antibiotics in developing countries should be advocated and in such countries, the existing empiric treatment regimes should be revised occasionally in order to reflect prevailing resistance phenotypes. such measures may help to preserve the potency of β-lactam antibiotics and improve success of chemotherapy. finally, the diversity of bla genes described in this study is relatively high and majority of genes in circulation among e. coli strains investigated have a global-like spread. we recommend that attempts be made to investigate the role of africa and other developing countries as sources or destinations of β-lactamase-producing strains.
