BACKGROUND
severe systemic diseases such as infections, inflammatory disorders, septicemia, endotoxemia, and colic can be associated with an activated coagulation state and predispose horses to develop thrombophlebitis or thrombosis. risk of clot formation at the site of venepuncture is enhanced by frequent venepuncture of the jugular vein, or the administration of irritant pharmaceuticals, or by insertion of catheter systems
 <cit> . treatment of thrombosis is directed against further thrombus formation and commonly performed with unfractioned heparin
 <cit>  or low-molecular weight heparin
 <cit> . although recombinant hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor that dissolves thrombi, has been investigated experimentally
 <cit> , thrombolytic agents are not commonly employed in equine medicine.

tissue-type plasminogen activator  is an endogenous enzyme that induces lysis of intravascular thrombi by the activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin components of blood clots
 <cit> . alteplase is a recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator. it is frequently used as a thrombolytic agent in human patients with cardiac infarction or stroke
 <cit> . in veterinary medicine, experience with rt-pa is limited
 <cit>  and derive mainly from experiences with cats suffering from aortic thromboembolism and case reports in dogs
 <cit> . there are also few case reports for the use of rt-pa in horses. in one case report a foal with aorto-iliac thrombosis received a 2 mg dose of rt-pa intravenously
 <cit> . recombinant t-pa was also used locally to treat a fibrinous pericarditis in a horse
 <cit> . an intrapleural instillation of alteplase and the newer generation plasminogen activator tenectoplase was used in a fibrinolytic treatment of septic pleuropneumonia
 <cit> . recently, enecteplase was also used locally to treat hyphema in a horse after ocular trauma
 <cit> . however, to the author’s knowledge, pharmacokinetic data of rt-pa in horses have not been reported yet.

combined with commonly used anticoagulants, for example heparin, rt-pa extends/augments thrombolytic therapy options for humans and potentially for animals as well
 <cit> . maximum plasma concentrations in humans during the infusion  of  <dig>  mg/kg t-pa are in the range of  <dig> to 1300 ng/ml
 <cit> . these concentrations were taken as approximate target values for the in vivo study in horses. thus, in the present study, the in vitro capability of rt-pa on equine thrombi was tested and the pharmacokinetics were evaluated in vivo in  <dig> adult horses.

methods
in vitro study
blood was collected from six mares and one gelding  aged between  <dig> and 25 years. horses were owned by the clinic for horses, university of veterinary medicine, hannover. all horses were clinically healthy and haematological variables  were within normal ranges. they had no systemic diseases and were not involved in research projects 4 weeks prior to the study. the horses were kept in individual box stalls, fed hay and grain and were on pasture daily. the animal experiment was approved by the german government . blood was obtained by venepuncture of the jugular vein and collected into 50 ml vials containing sodium citrate  to prevent clotting. subsequently, blood was centrifuged  and plasma was stored at 4°c until used.

siliconized glass vials  were filled with 4250 μl  <dig> % nacl, 200 μl ca-thromboplastin solution , and 500 μl cacl2-solution  and incubated at 37°c for 20 min. sodium citrate blood  was added, and the vials were sealed with parafilm  and inverted several times. for coagulation the vials remained at 37°c for four hours. the thrombi had a mean  weight of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  g. from each horse  <dig> to  <dig> thrombi were generated. the thrombi were transferred to petri dishes  and the thrombi were fixed with a cotton wire.

thrombolysis was performed in a water bath pre-warmed to 37°c. glass insets contained 20 ml autologous horse plasma. thrombi fixed with cotton fibres were submerged in plasma. plasma was continuously stirred by means of a magnetic stirrer . effects of rt-pa on equine thrombi were tested at concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 5 μg/ml. four horses were used for the complete dose range  and three additional horses were taken for  <dig> and  <dig>  μg/ml rt-pa. for each concentration three to four thrombi obtained from each horse were tested. for each time point and concentration the average of these three to four thrombi was taken.

thrombolysis was determined by weight loss. every hour thrombi were transferred to a glass beaker filled with 15 ml  <dig> % nacl and weighed. for the determination of the fibrin degradation product d-dimer, 200 μl of the supernatant was collected every hour and stored at −20°c until determination. d-dimer was detected with a reflectometer  according to the manufacturer’s protocol with in house- validation for horse samples.

in vivo study
four mares and two geldings  were included in the main in vivo study . they were  <dig> to 17 years old and weighed between  <dig> and 680 kg. the study was approved by the german government .

two horses were used for dose finding studies and  <dig> horses were used for pharmacokinetic data analysis. the general health status  was monitored frequently at the beginning of rt-pa infusion and the frequency was reduced over the 24 h observation period.

the horses received catheter systems  in the right and left jugular veins. one for administration of alteplase and one for blood sampling. before infusion of alteplase samples for hematological examination were collected  into different vacutainers . after collection, blood samples were centrifuged  and plasma was stored at −80°c until analysis. additionally, coagulation status was checked every hour after infusion started.

the rt-pa alteplase  was freshly prepared by dissolving the dry substance with the appropriate accompanying solvent to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. alteplase was administered intravenously over a 30 min period by means of an infusion pump . in a pilot study one horse received  <dig>  mg/kg and another received  <dig>  mg/kg. in the main study, six horses received 1 mg/kg alteplase. blood samples were taken directly before infusion , and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 300 min after infusion of alteplase. samples were collected into a vacutainer . the first 10 ml of blood obtained were discarded and the following 10 ml were collected. the permanent-catheter systems were immediately flushed with 10 ml  <dig> % nacl solution following insertion.

analysis of hemostasis and rt-pa in plasma
activated partial thromboplastin time  siemens healthcare diagnostics products gmbh, marburg, germany), the prothrombin time , the thrombin time, tt  and fibrinogen  were determined by means of a coagulometer .

hematocrit, erythrocyte count, leukocyte count and thrombocyte count were determined on an automated analyser . agglutination of thrombocytes was excluded microscopically. total protein was analysed by means of a refractometer .

the determination of rt-pa was performed via enzyme linked immunosorbant assay  . the standard calibration was carried out in horse plasma diluted 1: <dig> with dilution media, as the instructions of the test kit required dilution of at least 1: <dig> to minimize plasma matrix interactions with the elisa. the calibration with rt-pa used for the study and with the rt-pa provided with the kit were both highly linear between  <dig>  and 1 ng/ml, when plasma was diluted to at least 1: <dig>  calibration curves with higher concentrations of horse plasma led to non-linear curves. all samples were thus diluted to at least 1: <dig> and plasma samples were diluted after pilot measurements to fit the linear area of  <dig>  and 1 ng/ml. the intra-assay variance was  <dig> %, inter-assay variance, however, was up to  <dig> %. inter-assay variance might be due to repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the samples during the validation. it was therefore decided to aliquot the samples of the main experiment to avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles. additionally, crucial time points  were measured on two different elisas and and the mean of the two determinations was taken for analysis.

statistical analysis
the results were analysed to determine whether there was a significant difference between thrombus weights after four hours of incubation. analysis was performed by one way anova followed by an adjusted dunnett’s post hoc test for unequal sample sizes. changes in haematological parameters over time were analysed by t-tests for multiple comparisons using bonferroni’s adjustment.

the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a two compartment model . the following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: plasma concentration at the end of infusion , area under the curve , total plasma clearance  and plasma half lives .

RESULTS
in vitro study
to determine the thrombolysis, the weight of the thrombi and generation of d-dimer were measured every 60 min over a period of four hours. there was a time dependent decrease in thrombus weight and an increase in d-dimer generation for equine thrombi . an addition of  <dig>  μg/ml rt-pa to the autologous horse plasma led to nearly 90% weight reduction of thrombi 4 hours after incubation, whereas  <dig>  μg/ml and 5 μg/ml increased this thrombolytic activity only marginally.

there was a time dependent increase of fibrin degradation product d-dimer by incubation with rt-pa, whereas no such increase was observed with control thrombi . the  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/ml concentration led to highest d-dimer formation, whereas the effect was less pronounced at the higher concentrations .

in vivo study
infusion of rt-pa alteplase was well tolerated in the different dosages by every horse. none of the horses showed adverse drug reactions. in a pilot study, one horse received a dose of  <dig>  mg/kg alteplase. the maximal plasma concentration was 199 ng rt-pa/ml. by administration of  <dig>  mg/kg rt-pa cmax was 779 ng/ml. in order to achieve plasma rt-pa concentrations consistent with those demonstrated to be thrombolytic in vitro and in line with target concentrations in humans  a dose of 1 mg/kg was used for the main experiment. when administered over 30 min via infusion, the mean maximal plasma concentration measured was  <dig>  ng/ml rt-pa . the plasma clearance was  <dig>   ml/min/kg and t1/2α was  <dig>   min followed by a delayed β phase . the high standard deviation is due to the extremely prolonged t1/2β in one horse . the median t1/2β was 171 minutes with a range of 85–1061 min.

the auc was quite high due to the prolonged t1/2β . mean blood and coagulation parameters were within the reference range . however, activated partial thromboplastin time at hour  <dig> observation time was significantly reduced compared to the basal value.

discussion
the aim of the present study was to characterize the human recombinant plasminogen activator alteplase  for use as a possible thrombolytic agent in equine patients suffering from thrombosis. after determining the in vitro thrombolytic activity in equine thrombi, pilot pharmacokinetic data were obtained in healthy horses. present data indicate a dose dependent decrease in thrombus weight induced by rt-pa in in vitro generated equine thrombi. interestingly, addition of more than  <dig>  μg/ml did not result in a significant increase of thrombolytic activity and thus might be taken as a breakpoint and maximal plasma concentration to be achieved by infusion. additionally, higher concentrations may increase the risk of hemorrhage without increasing the efficacy. a meta-analysis reveals that treatment of humans suffering from pulmonary thromboembolism with rt-pa is associated with hemorrhage in  <dig> % of cases
 <cit> .

when comparing the present results with those published for human in vitro generated thrombi , there seems to be a difference in thrombolytic activity between human and equine thrombi. in human thrombi, as little as 150 ng/ml was sufficient to reduce the human thrombus weight by 50% within four hours and a nearly complete lysis of the thrombus was achieved by approximately 600 ng/ml
 <cit> . this difference in efficacy might be due to a slight difference in homology between equine and human t-pa. two isoforms are described for the equine tissue type plasminogen activator  and according to blast  the homology to the human alteplase is approximately 85%. thus, equine plasminogen is not the perfect substrate for human rt-pa, which has already been demonstrated in an in vitro enzyme activity study
 <cit> . there is approximately a 95% homology for the catalytic side of plasminogen between horse and man . however, the catalytic activity is less pronounced for human rt-pa
 <cit>  and for streptokinase
 <cit> . it is thus speculated that there might be differences in the tertiary structure between human and equine plasminogen
 <cit> .

the in vivo study complements the finding that rt-pa might be suitable as a thrombolytic agent in horses, as maximal blood concentrations similar to those required for thrombolysis in humans are achieved reliably. by an administration of 1 mg/kg alteplase over a period of 30 min, mean maximal concentrations of  <dig>  ng/ml were reached. this infusion was well tolerated by the horses, and adverse effects were not observed. only minor changes in blood parameters were noticed in some individuals. the reduced activated partial thromboplastin time at hour  <dig> observation time might not be of clinical significance as such changes are commonly observed in ill patients or under medication.

this is in accordance with observations in humans. no effects on fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time and thrombin clotting times were observed after infusion of up to  <dig>  mg/kg within 30 min in healthy human subjects. an infusion of  <dig>  mg/kg resulted in comparable maximal blood concentrations of rt-pa to 1 mg/kg administered to horses in the present study
 <cit> . the clearance rate is similar to findings in other species such as the approximate  <dig> to 20 mg/ml/min reported in man
 <cit> , but the apparent volume of distribution is higher compared to that determined in man
 <cit> . results obtained in humans showed that the distribution of rt-pa, a protein with a molecular mass of  <dig> , is restricted to the intravascular space and well perfused tissues. it is assumed that most rt-pa is removed from the circulation by specific uptake and degradation in the liver
 <cit> . the higher volume of distribution found in horses may be explained by the comparatively long terminal half life. nevertheless, the concentrations found between 90 min and 300 min are unlikely to play a clinically relevant role.

there are established methods for therapy of thrombi in horses. for example, the coagulation inhibiting potential of heparin is due to accelerating the complex formation between antithrombin and various activated coagulation factors, among which factor xa and thrombin are the most pivotal ones leading to a prevention of further clot formation
 <cit> . in contrast, recombinant hirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor acts independently of anti-thrombin activity and also inhibits fibrin bound thrombin
 <cit> . the mechanism of action of plasminogen activator alteplase is advantageous in that it activates the thrombus associated plasminogen to plasmin leading to a direct induction of the fibrinolytic system
 <cit> . with these properties rt-pa is an agent that is suitable for an initial thrombolytic therapy that is indicated in early phases of thrombosis, and should be combined or followed by a heparin therapy to be most effective
 <cit> . due to the initial thrombolytic effect it could be expected that a similar therapeutic regimen in horses is superior to commonly performed anticoagulative therapies.

recombinant t-pa has been used in dogs and cats with varying results. the dosing regimen differs from study to study . cats received total doses of  <dig> to 10 mg/kg with variable success. in one case report, a dog with acute distal aortic thrombosis received a bolus injection of 1 mg/kg rt-pa every 60 min  <dig> times in succession. after six days the dog received another  <dig>  mg/kg as boluses given 60 min apart, followed by two  <dig>  mg/kg boluses the next day. this procedure led to significant clinical improvement
 <cit> .

results obtained by the in vitro thrombolysis indicate a thrombus reduction by approximately 86% when thrombi are incubated with  <dig>  μg/ml rt-pa. based on the in vitro findings it seems that at least 1 mg/kg alteplase should be administered to achieve maximal concentrations that lead to optimal lysis of the thrombi.

collectively the results provide a basis for future therapeutic investigations of thrombotic diseases using rt-pa. the most promising results are anticipated for the treatment of acute jugular thrombi as rt-pa might induce complete thrombolysis. for chronic thrombi  the success might be more limited if results from human patients can be transferred to the horse
 <cit> . in one case report a foal with aorto-iliac thrombosis received a 2 mg dose of rt-pa intravenously. the foal developed a severe coagulopathy and was euthanized
 <cit> . however, considering the pharmacokinetic data obtained in the present study, a 2 mg infusion of rt-pa might be too little to show any efficacy.

CONCLUSIONS
from the in vitro and in vivo data it is suggested that rt-pa applied via intravenous infusion over a period of 30 minutes at a dose of 1 mg/kg might be suitable for the treatment of thrombotic diseases in horses. this dose regimen was not associated with severe adverse effects which would have led to limitations for the use of rt-pa in thrombotic horses.
