BACKGROUND
piezophiles are microorganisms adapted for optimal growth at hydrostatic pressure greater than  <dig>  mpa   <cit>  and a large number of these organisms has been isolated from deep-sea. since the ocean depths constitute the largest portion of the biosphere  <cit>  this environment has a great importance both for the total microbial mass and for the number of species that are present.

in the ocean, vertical transport of microorganisms may be accomplished in regions of upwelling and downwelling as well as through association of bacteria with sedimenting particles or with animals  <cit> ; for this reason deep-sea organisms may experience pressure differentials during their normal life. since many biological processes and cell structures are susceptible to pressure changes  <cit> , a counteracting action is expected to occur, most likely by controlling gene expression in a pressure-dependent way.

p. profundum ss <dig> is a piezophilic bacterium member of the vibrionaceae family, isolated at a depth of  <dig> m  <cit> ; it has an optimal growth pressure of  <dig> mpa, but it is also able to grow at atmospheric pressure . this organism is only moderately piezophilic, thus offering some advantages over obligate piezophiles, for example it can be manipulated at atmospheric pressure and its response to pressure variations can be easily monitored. furthermore, it is amenable of genetic manipulation and its genome has been completely sequenced  <cit> . one of the most interesting characteristics of this bacterium is its ability to modulate the abundance of several outer membrane proteins  in response to pressure  <cit> , in particular omph and ompl. omph increases its abundance 10– <dig> times as the hydrostatic pressure rises from  <dig>  to  <dig> mpa, while ompl decreases its abundance in the same pressure range  <cit> . these genes are under the control of toxr, a transmembrane regulatory protein present in all vibrionaceae so far sequenced. toxr was first identified in vibrio cholerae in which it regulates several virulence factors in response to changes in environmental parameters like osmolarity, ph and external amino acid abundance  <cit> . the toxr regulon of vibrio cholerae is very complex and, in conjunction with toxs, tcpp, tcph and toxt, is involved in the regulation of a large number of genes  <cit> . interestingly, the toxr orthologous gene in p. profundum ss <dig> is required for pressure-dependent regulation of omph and ompl in response to hydrostatic pressure changes  <cit> .

numerous studies indicate that transcriptome reconstruction may be very useful to understand bacterial adaptation to different environments. also small and compact genomes like that of helicobacter pylori revealed an unexpectedly complex transcriptional landscape  <cit> , while transcriptome reconstruction has helped in unravelling unclear phenotypes and in identifying complex srna regulatory networks  <cit> . in the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus rna-seq analysis led to the identification of significant rho-independent transcription terminations resulting in interesting transcriptional structures  <cit> .

in this paper we describe a study based on rna-seq, performed in order to compare the transcriptional profile of the p. profundum toxr mutant  with the parental strain db <dig> . these two strains were grown at two different pressures  in order to perform a detailed analysis of pressure-regulated genes. the high-resolution potential offered by rna-seq analysis allowed a complete characterization of bacterial transcriptional architecture at a level of detail that was previously not possible, highlighting many genes that are directly or indirectly regulated by toxr. moreover, the genomic annotation of this bacterium has now been considerably improved and includes many previously unidentified genes as well as a better characterization of the 5′ and 3′-utrs and several hundred untranslated small rna genes .

RESULTS
the photobacterium profundum transcriptome
global expression of chromosomes  <dig> and 2
we have analyzed the p. profundum transcriptome structure in db <dig> strain and toxr mutant  both grown at  <dig>  mpa  and  <dig> mpa . in table  <dig> we have reported the number of reads aligned on the reference genome for each sample, only 18-35% of the reads have a single alignment. a large fraction of the remaining sequences were obtained from rrna transcripts. despite the sample obtained from db <dig> strain grown at  <dig>  mpa gave a high number of reads, the number of those having a single alignment is quite low; we hypothesize this could be due to a lower efficiency in rrna depletion during the preparation of this sample. in fact the design of the capture oligos of the microbexpresstm kit  do not take into account the p. profundum rrna sequences and probably for this reason the rrna depletion efficiency is not very high. in the first column of table  <dig> are reported the strains  and the conditions  analysed, in the second column the throughput obtained for each sample, in the third column the total number of reads aligned on the reference genome  and on the fourth column only the reads having a single match on the p. profundum genome. in the fifth and sixth columns are reported the ratios between the number of reads obtained in the conditions analysed in comparison to the reads in the reference condition.

the analysis of the  <dig> genes  showed that a large portion of the genome is expressed, in fact, depending on the condition examined, approximately 91-92% of the chr.  <dig> and 85-87% of the chr.  <dig> genes have at least two reads mapped . obviously this calculation is only a rough indication because it depends from the total number of reads and growth conditions examined. despite this, our findings are not too different from those calculated for other bacteria with different methods. for example, toledo-arana and colleagues  <cit>  analyzed lysteria monocytogenes using tiling arrays and found that ∼ 98% of the genes are expressed.

statistical analysis indicates that some cog classes “j” , “d” , “o” , “m” , “f” , “s”  have an expression significantly higher compared to the global gene expression , while classes “h”  and “l” and genes that are not assigned to a specific cog class  have on average a lower expression . results are reported independently for chrs.  <dig> and  <dig> in additional file 1: table s <dig> these results are to a certain extent expected because class “j” contains genes coding for ribosomal proteins, “o” includes highly expressed chaperons like groel, dnak, “d” includes a small number of very highly expressed proteins like ftsz and ftsa. cog class “m” is of particular interest for deep-sea adaptation  because of the relevance of outer membrane proteins  to the uptake of nutrients present in low concentrations in the oligotrophic abyssal environment.

the percentage of genes having a medium/high expression on chr.  <dig>  is extremely high  in comparison to the chr.  <dig> , this confirmed the data previously obtained with microarrays  <cit>  and was verified for all the strains and the conditions examined .

in all vibrionaceae examined, the distribution of cog classes on chr.  <dig> is very different from that of chr.  <dig>  <cit> , for example in p. profundum cog classes  are overrepresented on chr.  <dig>  while “g”  is overrepresented on chr.  <dig>  <cit> . cog classes containing highly expressed genes largely overlap those that have more representation on chr.  <dig>  since replication of bacterial chromosomes increases copy numbers of genes located near origins, highly expressed show a clear tendency to locate near the origin of replication  <cit> . such differential gene dosages may be particularly important for vibrios as they harbour two chromosomes of different size  <cit>  resulting in increased gene dosage differences within the larger chromosome relative to the smaller one. in fact the relative abundances of origin proximate dna with respect to the terminus proximate dna appear to be higher for the large vibrio chromosomes than the small one  <cit> . this indicates that the higher gene expression on chr.  <dig> is mainly determined by the tendency of genes highly expressed  to be localized near chr.  <dig> origin.

as suggested by dryselius and colleagues  <cit>  cog category “l”  in vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus, vibrio fischeri and vibrio parahaemolyticus is over-represented on the early replicated part of the large chromosome, and only p. profundum deviates from this pattern. p. profundum genome harbours a large number of transposable elements that belong to the “replication, recombination and repair” category, this can explain its peculiarity. as reported in figure 1a, genes belonging to “l” group have a low expression in p. profundum and, despite the repetitive nature of these genes make them difficult to analyse using rna-seq, this is a possible explanation for the different gene distribution in p. profundum with respect to other vibrio species.

operon structure
as described in the materials and methods section, alignment of the rna-seq reads on the p. profundum genome allowed to identify transcripts boundaries and the p. profundum global operon structure.

this analysis was performed independently on the two strains and the two conditions examined in order to identify putative differences in operon structure. we identified a number of operons that are quite similar in structure regardless of the conditions and strains examined, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  and representing from  <dig> to  <dig> genes . since operon identification was performed only for genes having median coverage higher than two, variations in number of transcriptional units  among different growth conditions could be influenced by the number of sequences obtained for each sample. for this reason we normalized the data considering only the genes expressed. in this respect, the percentage of genes in operons range from  <dig> % to  <dig> % but this analysis emphasizes a strong difference between chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig>  in chr.  <dig> the percentage ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> %, while in chr.  <dig> it is comprised between  <dig> % and  <dig> %, clearly showing that genes located on chr.  <dig> are “less transcriptionally organized” and are normally expressed as monocistronic transcripts. it is known that genes subjected to horizontal gene transfer  are not particularly prone to be in operons  <cit>  but this can be only a minor determinant because hgt regions are only slightly overrepresented in the chr.  <dig>  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the percentage of genes transcribed as polycistronic rnas  in chr.  <dig> is very close to that predicted in the archeon halobacterium salinarum  using tiling arrays  <cit>  but completely different from those predicted using rna-seq in helicobacter pylori where  <dig> % of the genes are expressed as polycistronic elements  <cit> .

the number of genes belonging to the same operon ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> and the more abundant operons are those containing a lower number of genes , this is a general trend previously reported in other bacteria  <cit> .

the primary methods for operon identification in bacteria and archaea are based on computational approaches that take into consideration intergenic gene distance and co-occurence in different species, as well as whether or not the genes participate in the same biological process  <cit> . since our results are based also on gene expression, we have compared them with those obtained with computational methods, finding that  <dig> - <dig> %  of the gene couples predicted with our method are confirmed by the computational method of price and colleagues  <cit> . the very close agreement between the two methods suggests that our approach is reliable.

analyses of the polycistronic transcripts revealed a trend for genes belonging to certain cog classes to be organized in operons . we found statistically significant results for genes belonging to class “c” , “d” , “h” , “j” , “m” , “n” , “o”  and “u” . some of these results can be easily explained by the presence of some large operons such as those coding the ribosomal proteins  , the nadh ubiquinone reductase   and flagellar genes  . since all these classes are overrepresented on chr.  <dig>  <cit>  this can partially explain the higher number of operons identified on this chromosome.

identification of small protein-coding genes
analyses of the p. profundum transcriptional profiles indicate that intergenic regions  are frequently expressed. a comparative analysis among these putative new transcripts, the localization of the orfs predicted using four different bioinformatics software   <cit>  and the genomic position of the putative ribosome binding sites   lead to the identification of  <dig> “new” protein coding genes. most of these genes were missed in previous annotation due to their small size ; in fact, their average length is  <dig> aa and during the gene finding process, orfs shorter than  <dig> aa are frequently not considered as bona fide protein coding genes. orfs identified using rna-seq were further verified and annotated using blast search and cog . notably, bioinformatics software cannot predict  <dig> of these small genes, but in  <dig> of these we were able to find a rbs in the correct position with respect to the putative start codon and  <dig> more have similarity with proteins identified in other bacteria. among the  <dig> orfs identified,  <dig> are hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins, while  <dig> have similarity with proteins having known function.

some of the proteins that were missed in the previous annotation are of particular interest. for example the chi subunit of dna polymerase iii, the cell division atp-binding protein ftse, two trna synthetases, the heat shock protein htpx, the outer membrane chaperone skp , and some components of the flagellum system.

some of these proteins were identified as differentially expressed in the comparisons performed  providing a first glimpse of their functional properties. for example,  <dig> of these transcripts were found differentially expressed more than two times  in the experiment performed on parental strain grown at different pressures. in some cases we found a relevant expression change, for example the transcript coded by pbpra0243a gene  increases its abundance more than seven times increasing hydrostatic pressure from  <dig>  to  <dig> mpa.

a comparative analysis performed considering rna-seq coverage, the position of the putative rbs and the structure of the putative protein coding genes identified using the four software mentioned above, led to the identification of  <dig> genes with a wrong start codon prediction in our previous annotation . in  <dig> of these orfs the tss identified using rna-seq was located downstream of the predicted start codon  and a careful analysis of the rbs position allowed the identification of a new start codon that agree with the transcript structure. the  <dig> corrected orf were translated in aa sequences and compared with the ncbi complete microbial genome database using a blastp search. our predictions were confirmed by identifying orthologous genes in  <dig> cases .

massive number of small rnas
the vast majority  of the new transcripts identified in p. profundum do not have the characteristics to be considered as bona fide protein coding regions. the main features that we have considered to classify transcripts as putative srnas are the absence of a rbs, low similarity with proteins identified in other bacteria and the absence of likely protein coding regions.

these putative srnas could be divided in different classes depending on their localization with respect to the flanking known protein-coding genes . the first class comprises  <dig> transcripts localized in irs, while the second class consists of  <dig> transcripts that are partially overlapping with the 5′ or 3′-end of protein coding genes.  <dig> of the transcripts belonging to the second class overlap with the rbs of known protein-coding gene and this suggests that they could influence ribosome binding and thus possess a role in post-transcriptional regulation.

analyses performed to define the coverage uniformity of the rna-seq into known protein coding genes, indicates that a small fraction shows a marked coverage difference between the 5′ and the 3′ part of the gene. a careful manual analysis of these transcripts led to the identification of distinct regions having different coverage with respect to the rest of the orf, that could represent cis-encoded srnas involved in determining the stability of the protein-coding transcript. we have classified these srnas in a third separate class comprising  <dig> putative transcripts .

only a small fraction  of these three classes of putative srnas have a similarity in rfam database.

 <dig> of the transcripts belonging to these three classes are localized in repeated regions. despite the ambiguous assignment of these transcripts to a specific genomic region, some of these are of great interest. similarity search performed in rfam database indicates that a large region located on chr.  <dig> between the gene pbprb <dig> and pbprb <dig> contains a cluster of  <dig> putative crispr-dr <dig> elements . moreover in the region located between pbpra <dig> and pbpra <dig> we found four trnas that were not identified using bioinformatic analysis.

it is widely known that trans-acting srnas localized in irs have different roles with respect to the cis-encoded antisense srnas whose function remains largely unknown  <cit> . we have calculated the free energy of these different classes and of the 5′-utrs using rnafold software of the vienna package  <cit>  and we have compared our results with those obtained by random sequences having similar length and base composition. our data confirmed that 5′-utrs have higher free energy with respect to random genomic sequences and that this is mainly due to the low fraction of bases in secondary structures located close to the ribosome binding sites  <cit> . for this reason only 5′-utrs longer than  <dig> bases tend to have a lower free energy with respect to random sequences . putative srnas localized in irs tend to have a lower free energy  and this probably reflects their different role and underlines the importance that secondary structures recover for the function of trans-acting srnas. the function of most of the putative cis-encoded antisense rnas remains unknown, but gene ontology analysis of the corresponding protein-coding genes revealed that  <dig> go classes are overrepresented: transcription with  <dig> genes  and signalling processes with  <dig> genes  . this finding is of great interest since it has been demonstrated that two-components systems and srnas are interconnected in order to form networks that integrate and transduce information from the environment into fine-tuned changes of gene expression  <cit> . although two-components systems usually act by modulating the expression of trans-acting srnas, it is also of great interest that putative cis-acting srnas are able to modulate expression of their cognate antisense genes.

in our experiment we found  <dig> genes out of  <dig> belonging to the signalling process are differentially expressed, two are slightly up-regulated in parental strain at high pressure ; while three are down-regulated in mutant strain when compared to the parental at high pressure .

a very interesting point is that expression level of some putative srnas identified can change in response to hydrostatic pressure. among the unknown srnas the more interesting are pbpra0833b, pbpra2131b, pbprb0423a and pbpra3306a, that are more expressed at  <dig>  mpa  while pbpra2336a, pbpra2818a, pbpra3027a and pbprb0103a are more extensively expressed at high pressure . among the srnas having similarity in the rfam database, the putative untranslated 6s gene  is more highly expressed at low pressure, while the putative untranslated rfn  and the putative untranslated csrb  are more highly expressed at high pressure. the rfn riboswitch  <cit>  is located upstream of pbprb <dig>  involved in the biosynthesis of riboflavin. the biologically active forms of thiamin  and riboflavin  are tpp and fmn/fad, respectively. these cofactors participate in numerous metabolic pathways in all organisms. this could suggest a possible role of riboflavin in deep-sea adaptation.

p. profundum utrs
rna-seq allows the analysis of 5′and 3′-utr regions. using a self-written perl script the coverage of the regions upstream of the start codon and downstream of the stop codon were searched for a sharp signal reduction of the coverage value . since the transcript structure of genes having a small number of sequences could not be reliably determined, this analysis was performed grouping together the reads of the four experiments and considering only the transcripts with an average coverage higher than  <dig>  after manual verification of the data obtained and a comparison with predicted operons, we identified  <dig> tss  and  <dig> transcript ends .

nearly 8% of the 5′-utrs of the genes are shorter than  <dig> nucleotides and should be considered leaderless transcripts. this percentage is a little higher than that found in h. pylori where  <dig> % of the protein coding transcripts are leaderless  <cit>  but lower than that of s. elongatus that has 16% of leaderless transcripts.

in general the size of p. profundum 5′-utrs are very large in comparison with data obtained from other studies    <cit>  and there are not clear differences in size distribution between chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig> . we have identified  <dig> transcripts with 5′-utr longer than  <dig> nucleotides, since these could harbour novel cis-regulatory rna structures  <cit> . there is a great potential for cis-regulation, at least if compared with the  <dig> long utrs identified for example in h. pylori. despite this, a similarity search performed in rfam database using  <dig> 5′-utrs longer than  <dig> bases leads to the identification of only  <dig> known rna elements, suggesting that in p. profundum and probably in other bacteria the number of riboswitches with unknown function is very high. 

we have compared the size distribution of the 5′-utrs with those determined using tiling arrays and rna-seq both in bacteria  and archaea   <cit>   and we have found that p. profundum have longer 5′-utrs, particularly in the range 50– <dig> bp. 

irs in bacteria are under selective pressure to minimize their size while maintaining the necessary regulatory sites. this is also supported by the observation that double-regulatory regions, localized between two divergently transcribed genes  are larger than single-regulatory  regions. it is also evident that different bacterial genomes have widely different average intergenic region sizes  and this is independent from genome size  <cit> . to explain this point we have recovered irss for the six prokaryotes considered in the analysis of the 5′-utr size . we followed the same procedure reported by molina and colleagues  <cit>  considering only irs located between operons predicted using bioinformatics  <cit> . comparison between median irss and median 5′-utr size revealed that they are slightly correlated  . this suggests that in bacteria  utr region size is a relevant factor determining the great variability of the irs observed between different species.

we performed an analysis considering only p. profundum irs and utr regions. we have classified irs as suggested by molina and colleagues  <cit>   and we grouped them in classes according to their size . figure 4d highlights that utr size is roughly proportional  to the length of irss. to verify this result we have selected all the  <dig> irs where both the utrs of the flanking genes are known. all the ir classes  gave similar results with utr regions accounting for 38-43% of the ir. these findings support the hypothesis that large irs have also a higher regulatory potential as described by molina and colleagues  <cit> , tending to harbour transcripts with larger utrs that can have higher cis-regulatory potential.

we have determined length distribution of utrs for different functional categories  and we detected significant correlations . genes belonging to the cog group “h”  have both longer 5′ and 3′-utrs, those belonging to the “c”  class have longer 5′-utrs and shorter 3′-utrs, those of the “i”  group have longer 5′-utrs and those of the “o”  group have shorter 3′-utrs. these results suggest that genes belonging to “h”, “c” and “i” groups require complex regulation. the “energy” group is of particular interest here because of its role in high-pressure adaptation . in general the 3′-utr regions are shorter and contain a smaller amount of regulatory information in bacteria then the 5′-utrs .

global analyses performed on chr.  <dig> and chr.  <dig> using rnamotif  <cit>  and recog  indicated the presence of  <dig> rho-independent terminators , while our rna-seq analyses identified  <dig> transcription terminator sites corresponding to  <dig> protein-coding genes  .

we were able to identify that  <dig> transcription terminator sites  corresponding to a specific rho-independent terminator, while  <dig> of the sites  identified in our analyses do not have a correspondent rho-independent terminator predicted. 78% of the  <dig> transcription terminator sites are within  <dig> bp of the terminator site, while  <dig> % are within  <dig> bp , this finding indicates that in general our prediction of the terminator sites agrees with those derived from bioinformatic analyses, but the size of the 3′-utrs are slightly underestimated . we can speculate that the presence of secondary structures in the terminator region could reduce the efficiency of retrotranscription resulting in a small underestimate of transcript length.

the toxr regulon and deep-sea adaptation
analyses of the genes differentially expressed was performed considering only solid reads mapping to one location in the p. profundum genome. this procedure prevented the analyses of repeated regions  but it allowed a more reliable analysis of the remaining regions.

general discussion on differentially expressed genes
one of the aims of this procedure was the identification of genes differentially expressed in p. profundum cultures grown at low   versus high pressure   and to clarify the role of the toxr transcription factor in high pressure adaptation.

in general, the impact of hydrostatic pressure variation on the parental strain transcriptome is quite strong, resulting in  <dig> % of the genes  being expressed more than twice as much  at high pressure , while  <dig> % of the genes  are induced two-fold or higher at low pressure. the pressure effect is even stronger on the toxr mutant strain with  <dig> % of the genes , the total number is lower because plasmid is absent in the mutant strain induced at high pressure and  <dig> %  induced at low pressure. the major role played by the toxr transcription factor in pressure-responsive gene expression was highlighted by the fact that the gene sets influenced by pressure changes in the db <dig> and tw <dig>  strains only partially overlapped .

these general data bring out a clear alteration of the transcriptional profile in strain tw <dig>  with a dramatic expression increase of numerous genes influenced by high hydrostatic pressure in strain db <dig> 

cog and go analysis
statistical analyses performed on cog and gene ontology of the differentially expressed genes gave a general overview of the biological processes involved.

the comparison performed between the parental strain at low and high pressure identified four cog categories statistically enriched : “c” , “f” , “m”  and “p” . as previously found  <cit>  these results reflect the fundamental role of transport process in high pressure adaptation. noteworthy, two of these four cog categories  were also identified in the comparison between parental and mutant strains highlighting the basic regulatory role of toxr on gene classes involved in high pressure adaptation.

cog analyses were performed considering two gene expression thresholds  and two p-values thresholds  . despite the more stringent threshold reduced the number of genes under analysis, we obtained very similar cog results .

analyses performed considering gene ontology biological processes had substantially the same goal as the cog analyses but allowed the identification of more specific classes. to further refine the identification of specific classes involved in this mechanism, we performed different go analyses for up and down regulated genes .

in the comparison performed between the parental strain grown at high and low pressure, we found  <dig> differentially expressed genes involved in transport of different compounds . some of these processes were also statistically enriched in genes identified comparing the mutant and the parental strains and particularly in genes more expressed in the mutant strain at low pressure and in the parental at high pressure .

genes located on chr.  <dig> and coding for atp-synthase  were the main determinant of the go categories and included “atp synthesis coupled proton transport” and “energy coupled proton transport down electrochemical gradient” .

finally one of the genes involved in go class “response to superoxide”  belongs to a large gene cluster more expressed at high pressure in db <dig> strain and localized on chr.  <dig>  although their expression is strongly decreased in the mutant strain , they maintain their “pressure-dependent regulation” in mutant, indicating that these genes sense and respond to pressure using a toxr-independent pathway. this gene cluster has been analyzed in detail in a previous work  <cit> . the genes of this cluster belong to the stickland reaction pathway responsible for amino acid fermentation through an amino acid reductase containing selenocysteine. in this region we have also identified two small orfs encoding proteins missed in previous annotation . also these small orfs are differentially expressed and both are annotated as “putative glycine reductase complex component a, selenocysteine-containing”. we have excluded the possibility that these small orfs derived from sequencing errors by comparing their gene arrangement in both strains db <dig> and 3tck  .

analysis of the toxr regulon
the deletion in the tw <dig> strain  <cit>  was clearly identified analyzing the distribution of the short reads on the toxr gene  . in the rna-seq experiments performed on tw <dig> strain we did not find sequences aligned in the region located between  <dig> and  <dig> bp of the toxr gene  . this is a clear demonstration of the specificity of our rna-seq approach. it was previously inferred that toxr activity is regulated by a dimerization process that occurs at low-pressure, accompanied by an increase of protein level  <cit> . our data indicates that there is also a control at the transcription level with a slight  increase of the toxr expression level. the toxs gene, localized downstream of the the toxr gene in the same transcriptional unit, has a similar transcriptional behaviour.

as previously reported omph  and ompl  porins expression is controlled by toxr transcriptional regulator   <cit> . rna-seq experiments corroborate these results at transcriptional level confirming that toxr is necessary for hydrostatic pressure regulation of these two genes and that omph maintains its high expression level also in the mutant strain, while ompl expression is strongly reduced . 

our data indicate that these two porins have a very high absolute expression level and this suggests their importance in membrane transport processes. omph is the fourth most expressed protein-coding gene at high pressure in the parental strain  and ompl is the fourth most expressed at low pressure  ; obviously we did not consider genes coding for rrna transcripts because large parts of these transcripts have been removed before library construction .

another interesting point is that the number of genes having an “omph-like” expression profile is larger than those having an “ompl-like” expression. this is visible from the venn diagram reported in additional file 17: figure s <dig> but the global behaviour of the genes differentially expressed is also represented by the hierarchical clustering in figure  <dig>  in this clustering diagram we have highlighted the main gene clusters, reporting also the behaviour in the four comparisons in the small figure insets. from this image it is evident that the ompl gene is under the control of a fairly unique regulatory scheme, whereas many more genes exhibit “omph-like” control . results obtained from hierarchical clustering and euclidean distance calculation performed comparing each p. profundum transcript with omph and ompl expression profiles indicates that  <dig> genes have an expression profile similar to omph . proteins encoded by these genes have very different biological functions and this may reflect the complexity of high pressure adaptation. for example pbpra <dig> encodes ferritin, a protein involved in iron storage. various papers have recently demonstrated the competitive advantage conferred by the ability to cache iron, enabling certain bacterial species to dominate areas of the world’s oceans that are typically iron-poor, such as in the expanses around the antarctic  <cit> . interestingly large-scale iron fertilization might affect also deep-sea ecosystems as suggested by the microscopic pyrite particles emitted by the deep sea vents  <cit>  and this indicates the importance of the iron in the deep sea. the ferritin expression control performed by toxr could confer an important advantage to deep sea environments where iron is one of the limiting factors.

one of the more interesting genes identified encodes the ompc porin protein  . the orthologous gene in e. coli is necessarily required for hyperosmotic adaptation in the alkaline medium  <cit>  and it was previously demonstrated that this gene is controlled by ompr  <cit> . this led us to hypothesize that some similarities exists between the role of ompr in e. coli and of toxr in p. profundum and also between the osmotic stress response and high pressure adaptation. ompr protein of e. coli has high similarity with various transcriptional regulators of p. profundum, in particular with ompr- <dig>  that is strongly up-regulated at  <dig> mpa. ompr- <dig> is differentially expressed both in parental and in mutant strains, this indicates that it can influence expression of genes in response to hydrostatic pressure independently from toxr. this finding suggests that the transcriptional response to hydrostatic pressure is complex and, as previously explained, genes regulated by toxr are only a fraction of the high number of genes influenced by pressure changes .

finally we have compared the putative toxr regulon determined in v. cholerae <cit>  and, curiously we found very small overlap with our results . out of  <dig> differentially expressed genes identified comparing n <dig> strain and toxr mutant in v. cholerae, we were able to identify  <dig> orthologous genes in p. profundum. analysis of results obtained in ss <dig> indicates that only  <dig> genes are differentially expressed in at least one of the two comparisons performed between db <dig> and tw <dig>  these genes are ompl, nlpe , the sigma- <dig> modulation protein coded by pbpra <dig> and the gene coding the outer membrane porin-like protein ompt . in these two vibrionaceae, toxr has quite different roles, in fact in v. cholerae it coordinates expression of two critical sets of genes involved in bacterial virulence, while in p. profundum it regulates gene expression in response to hydrostatic pressure changes. the small number of regulated genes shared by these two microorganisms suggests that only those genes having a role in both of these two different adaptations  are regulated by the toxr transcription factor in both v. cholerae and in p. profundum.

genes having expression profile different from omph
the deep-sea is a very complex environment, characterized by a peculiar combination of chemical-physical parameters and nutrient sources. this raises the question whether organism adaptation to the abyssal environment requires complex gene regulation.

as previously mentioned clustering depicted in figure  <dig> indicates that behaviour of differentially expressed genes identified in rna-seq experiment is heterogeneous and could be grouped in various clusters. besides the “omph” or “ompl-like” gene clusters, the four other groups highlighted in figure  <dig> are characterized by specific gene functions: the second cluster from top contains numerous rrna genes, the third one includes genes localized on chr.  <dig> and coding for the f0-f <dig> atp-synthase, the fifth cluster comprises genes involved in sulphate transport and utilization and the sixth cluster includes genes up-regulated at low pressure but not regulated by toxr .

as previously mentioned, go analysis reveals the presence of genes belonging to the “hydrogen transport” category  . this result is due to the differential expression of the chr.  <dig> genes coding for f0-f <dig> atp-synthase . previous annotation indicates that this multiprotein complex is composed by eight subunits, while pbprb <dig> was annotated as a hypothetical protein. a blastp similarity search performed against “nr” and “microbes” databases  found similarity only with hypothetical proteins. despite this, both the results obtained from the transcriptome structure and also gene expression clustering indicates that pbprb <dig> is part of the “atp-synthase gene cluster” . using string database  <cit>  we found that pbprb <dig> is part of the same multiprotein complex  and finally, using the smart database  <cit>  we found that it has an atp-synthase i domain.

interestingly, “chr.  <dig> atp-synthase” genes increase their expression when hydrostatic pressure decreases from  <dig> to  <dig>  mpa, moreover at low pressure its expression is higher in tw <dig> strain respect to db <dig> . in contrast, expression of the chr.  <dig> atp-synthase  is not influenced by pressure, and its absolute expression level is very high  with respect to the chr.  <dig> atp synthase .

similarity searches performed using blastp indicates that p. profundum, vibrio splendidus and vibrio harveyi have two different copies of the f0-f <dig> atp synthase, one located on chr.  <dig> and one on chr.  <dig> while vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus and vibrio fischeri have only one copy on chr.  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis performed using homogenom database  <cit>   clearly indicates that the gene clusters localized on chr.  <dig> are similar among all of these species and clearly distinct from those localized on chr.  <dig> 

taken all together these data indicate that the f0-f <dig> atp synthase is duplicated only in a small number of vibrionaceae species, the two copies are clearly different and possibly have evolved some specialized functions. our gene expression data suggest that the two different complexes have a distinct role in p. profundum and are possibly related to high pressure adaptation. pressure changes have a dramatic role in membrane organization and subsequently they have a strong effect on proteins involved in energy production and more generally on membrane proteins  <cit>  . we can speculate that p. profundum, and possibly other vibrionaceae, evolved the ability to control expression of the genes coding the “chr.  <dig> atp synthase” to compensate reduction of functionality determined on the “main” atp synthase by suboptimal environmental conditions. to our knowledge the other vibrio species having two different atp-synthase copies are not adapted to high pressure growth but vibrio harveyi has been isolated both from shallow water and deep sea  <cit> . further analysis will be performed in the future to understand if the two f0-f <dig> atp synthase copies could be involved in high pressure adaptation in other vibrio species.

in the p. profundum genome we have identified  <dig> porin genes. we have discussed above the role of three porins regulated by toxr transcription factor omph , ompl  and ompc . expression of two hypothetical maltoporin genes  is influenced by pressure but, curiously, the pbprb <dig> transcript is more abundant at  <dig> mpa in the parental strain, while the pbprb <dig> transcript is also more abundant at  <dig> mpa but only in the mutant strain. moreover pbprb <dig> transcript displays a very high expression with respect to pbprb <dig>  finally, the gene pbpra <dig>  belonging to the gram-negative porin superfamily has a higher expression at  <dig>  mpa  but only in the parental strain. this gene class is a clear example of the complexity of gene expression at different pressures as revealed by the comparison between parental and mutant strains at different hydrostatic pressures.

it has been suggested that omph provides a larger diffusion channel in the outer membrane respect to ompl  <cit>  and this could enhance growth and survival in nutrients-limiting environments like ocean depths, because of dissolved organic matter reduction with increasing depth  <cit> . piezophiles could experience fluctuations in nutrient availability  <cit>  and porins that are more expressed at high pressure  could play the same role as the one suggested for e. coli ompf in dilute nutrient environments. ompf has a larger pore diameter with respect to ompc allowing at least 10-fold higher diffusion rate than that provided by an equivalent amount of ompc porin. this is particularly important in the case of large molecules, such as disaccharides  <cit> . this suggests that the ability to modulate porin abundance, especially those involved in the diffusion of large compounds, could be relevant in the survival strategy of the piezophilic bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
our results highlight the potential of rna-seq in transcriptome structure analysis, both for the identification of differentially expressed genes and for the reconstruction of the transcriptional landscape. this study made it possible to increase the known number of p. profundum protein-coding genes by more than 5% through the identification of small genes missing in our previous bioinformatic analyses. the transcriptome study also revealed a high number of srnas and indicated that their expression can be modified in response to hydrostatic pressure changes.

the identification of utrs pointed out the high complexity of the p. profundum transcriptome. p. profundum harbors  <dig> genes having long 5′-utrs; this indicates a high potential for novel cis-regulatory rna structures, much higher that generally found in other prokaryotes. on the other hand, the application of rna-seq analysis to more bacteria will probably change our general understanding of utrs and their distribution.

the correlation between utr length and irs was determined by comparing p. profundum with other bacteria and archea and suggests that prokaryotes with very large irs could have an extremely high cis-regulatory potential.

we have expanded and strengthened the role of toxr in high pressure adaptation. data obtained from the comparison of parental and toxr mutant strains provided new insights into the toxr regulon of p. profundum, while a comparison with v. cholerae revealed very little overlap between the toxr-regulons identified in these two organisms. these results indicate that, even within closely related bacteria, evolution can dramatically modify regulons in order to enable the adaptation to widely different environments. since toxr can sense different environmental parameters, vibrio species can use this sensor/transcription factor to respond to different stimuli, but this requires concomitant deep modification of the regulated gene cluster.

finally, our data suggest that while toxr plays a major role in regulating genes involved in high pressure adaptation the expression of many genes can change in response to hydrostatic pressure independent of the presence of toxr; this suggests that other transcription factors, for example ompr- <dig>  may also have a role in deep-sea sensing and adaptation.
