BACKGROUND
heat-induced browning is a phenomenon caused by high temperatures which discolor the seed coats of many legumes. the brown discoloration affects the visual appearance and quality of seeds which reduces its commercial value. the heat-induced brown discoloration affects the seed coats of soybean  <cit> , common bean , cowpea  <cit> , faba bean  <cit>  and lentil  <cit> . the genetic determinants underlying heat-induced brown discoloration of seed coats in cowpea as well as other legumes is currently unknown.

in cowpea, the brown discoloration only appears on the seed coat and does not affect the underlying cotyledons  <cit> . in general, heat-induced browning can appear as patches or blotches, at the ends of the seed or over the entire surface of the cowpea seed  <cit> . hall and patel  using microscopic and visual inspection noted that the tissue in the center of the brown discoloration appeared to be sunken and the seeds that were affected had rough textured seed coats. the brown discoloration of the seed coat has been observed in green seeds of fully matured cowpea pods, however, the brown discoloration is more distinct on dry matured seeds  <cit> .

hall and patel  studied the genetic inheritance of heat-induced browning in three cowpea populations derived from crosses with the heat-induced browning genotype, tvu 4552; tvu  <dig> x cb <dig>  tvu  <dig> x bambey  <dig> and tvu  <dig> x pi  <dig>  it was confirmed with backcross populations that the hbs trait is controlled by a single nuclear gene dominant to normal non-browning seed coat phenotype   <cit> . the rate of the brown discoloration can be temperature controlled  <cit> . an increase in night temperatures especially during pod-filling produced more browning of seeds with rough textured seed coats  <cit> .

molecular genetic tools and genomic resources have been developed for cowpea with an objective of enhancing breeding programs for the improvement of cowpea varieties for the united states, india, brazil and numerous countries in africa and asia. these genomic resources have been integrated by using a 1536-snp genotyping platform and include an est-derived snp consensus genetic map , known syntenic relationships between cowpea, medicago truncatula, glycine max, phaseolus vulgaris and arabidopsis thaliana, and a cowpea est sequence collection housed in harvest:cowpea database  <cit> . the cowpea physical map has been anchored to the consensus genetic map using the same snp genotyping platform and sequenced bac clones  <cit> . in addition, more than  <dig> diverse cowpea accessions have been snp genotyped and a first draft of the cowpea genome sequence has been assembled  <cit> . these resources will enable dissection of underlying genetic components of target agronomic traits using genetic and physical mapping.

in this study, we identified three qtl, hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig>  associated with heat-induced browning of seed coats using the cowpea ril populations it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> and it84s- <dig> x tvu <dig>  snp markers were identified which co-segregated with the heat-induced browning of seed coats phenotype in the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci, and could be used for indirect selection in breeding a higher quality cowpea grain. additionally, ethylene forming enzymes were identified as a cowpea candidate gene for the hbs- <dig> locus and an acc synthase  <dig> gene was identified as a cowpea candidate gene for the hbs- <dig> locus.

RESULTS
qtl analysis
qtl analysis of two phenotypic datasets for the it93k-503- <dig>  x cb <dig>  population identified two loci for the heat-induced browning phenotype. we designated the major locus as hbs- <dig> and the minor locus as hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> spanned  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on linkage group  <dig> of the it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> individual genetic map . the most significant region  spanned  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm  . snp markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> were the most significant markers for both experiments . marker 1_ <dig> had the highest association with the heat-induced browning phenotype and accounted for  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the phenotypic variance in the two experiments, respectively . the corresponding hbs- <dig> locus was positioned on the cowpea consensus genetic map where it spanned  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on linkage group 5; the most significant region  spanned from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . the minor locus, hbs- <dig>  spanned from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on linkage group  <dig> of the individual map . snp marker 1_ <dig> accounted for the highest percent phenotypic variance of  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  . hbs- <dig> was positioned on the cowpea consensus genetic map where it spanned from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on lg <dig> . hbs- <dig> overlapped snp markers 1_ <dig>  and 1_ <dig>  which were previously identified within the stage ii heat-tolerance qtl cht- <dig> <cit> . heat shock proteins , dna j heat shock family protein  and hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family  were identified as potential candidate genes within the syntenic loci of cht- <dig> in soybean  <cit> . the overlap of the hbs- <dig> locus with the cht- <dig> locus does not concur with the findings of hall and patel  in which the heat-induced browning of seed coats trait was not linked with heat tolerance in early floral bud development. however, this qtl mapping study and lucas et al.  used different cowpea populations than the study by hall and patel .figure  <dig>

marker-trait association within the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci
cowpea genotypes which differ in their phenotype to heat-induced browning of seed coats were chosen for a marker-trait association to narrow the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci. it93k-503- <dig>  it84s- <dig>  it93k- <dig>  tvu- <dig>  tvx- <dig>  tvu- <dig> and tvu- <dig> were positive for the heat-induced browning phenotype and are referred to as hbs . tvu- <dig>  cb <dig>  cb <dig>  cb <dig>  524b and bambey  <dig> were negative for the heat-induced browning phenotype and are referred to as hbs . within the most significant region of the hbs- <dig> locus, which extended from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm on lg <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> snp markers co-segregated with hbs  and hbs  genotypes . the hbs positive genotypes had the adenine nucleotide at the 1_ <dig> locus, while the hbs negative genotypes were associated with the guanine nucleotide . the adenine/guanine snp in marker 1_ <dig> is at position  <dig> of cowpea unigene  <dig> and can be viewed in harvest:cowpea  <cit> . for snp marker 1_ <dig>  the hbs positive genotypes had the thymine nucleotide which is color-coded blue while the hbs negative genotypes had the adenine nucleotide and were color-coded green . the thymine/adenine snp in marker 1_ <dig> is position  <dig> of cowpea unigene  <dig> and can be viewed in harvest:cowpea  <cit> . snp markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> could both be used as molecular markers to screen against the heat-induced browning of seed coats trait in cowpea.figure  <dig>

theoretically, these three “tagged snps” could be used to genotype the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> haplotype blocks to determine the phenotype, rather than the sixty-six snp markers within the hbs- <dig> qtl and eleven snp markers within the hbs- <dig> qtl. however, a larger and more diverse set of cowpea germplasm would be needed to test and validate this approach.

synteny of hbs- <dig> with soybean, medicago and common bean
the hbs- <dig> locus was examined for synteny with the soybean genome and a high co-linearity was observed for soybean chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . soybean orthologs for eleven out of twenty-three snp markers were identified in the co-linear region of soybean chromosome  <dig>  spanning from glyma02g <dig> to glyma02g <dig>  which corresponded to  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm of the hbs- <dig> locus . the region surrounding the soybean orthologs to snp markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> was examined on the soybean genome browser on the phytozome website  <cit>  for genes associated with heat stress. several soybean loci were closely linked with the soybean ortholog for cowpea snp 1_ <dig> and were considered candidate genes for the heat-induced browning of seed coats phenotype; glyma02g <dig> was annotated as an aterf3/erf <dig>  and glyma02g <dig>  glyma02g <dig> and glyma02g <dig> were annotated as ethylene-forming enzymes  . the syntenic locus on soybean chromosome  <dig> spanned from glyma14g <dig> to glyma14g <dig> which corresponded to  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm of the hbs- <dig> locus on the cowpea consensus genetic map . soybean locus glyma14g <dig> was annotated as an aterf3/erf <dig>  and was considered a putative candidate gene for the hbs- <dig> locus . other putative soybean candidate genes for the hbs- <dig> locus included glyma14g <dig>  glyma14g <dig> and glyma14g <dig>  which were annotated as efes .

the hbs- <dig> locus was syntenic with m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> where it spanned from medicago locus medtr5g <dig> to medtr5g <dig>  which corresponded to  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm of the hbs- <dig> locus on the cowpea consensus genetic map . several medicago genes were observed in the region of medicago orthologs to snps 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> and were considered as putative candidate genes for the hbs- <dig> locus; medtr5g <dig>  medtr5g <dig> and medtr5g <dig> were annotated as ethylene response factor  <dig> , medtr5g <dig> was annotated as erf <dig> and medtr5g <dig> was annotated as an efe .

snp markers for the hbs- <dig> locus were examined in the common bean genome to determine if a syntenic relationship existed; the hbs- <dig> locus was highly co-linear with common bean chromosome  <dig>  extending from locus phvul.008g <dig> to phvul.008g <dig> . the marker-order between cowpea and common bean was conserved, although the gene order was inverted . phvul.008g <dig> and phvul.008g <dig> were slightly upstream from co-segregating snp marker 1_ <dig> and were annotated as ethylene-forming enzyme and acc oxidase  <dig> .

hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> on the cowpea physical map
the cowpea physical map  <cit>  which has been anchored to the cowpea consensus genetic map via snp markers and sequenced bac clones was used to identify a contig which overlapped the hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci. significant markers from the qtl analysis and closely linked markers from the cowpea consensus genetic map identified cowpea bac contigs and clones which overlapped the heat-induced browning qtls. snp markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> which were identified in bac clone cm018c <dig> of contig <dig> positioned the hbs- <dig> locus on the physical map . bac clone cm018c <dig> has  <dig> fingerprint bands which estimated its size as  <dig>  bps  <cit> . annotations for bac clone cm018c <dig> revealed the presence of three ethylene-forming enzymes  . the fact that efes and other genes involved in the biosynthesis of ethylene were identified in the syntenic loci of hbs- <dig> in cowpea, soybean, medicago and common bean reinforces the utility of syntenic relationships in identifying candidate genes between the legume species.table  <dig>

the length of the hbs- <dig> qtl was quite extensive and many contigs overlapped the region. the most significant marker from the qtl analysis, snp 1_ <dig> was imbedded in bac clone ch082b <dig> of contig <dig> . however, no genes of interest were identified in the clone.

the hbs- <dig> locus was also positioned on the cowpea physical map where bac contigs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> incompletely spanned the hbs- <dig> locus . snp marker 1_ <dig> which co-segregated with the heat-induced browning phenotype in the hbs- <dig> locus was not identified in the cowpea physical map. however, snp 1_ <dig>  shared the same marker bin as snp 1_ <dig>  on the cowpea consensus genetic map, so it was considered the closest marker to the hbs- <dig> locus . snp 1_ <dig> was identified in bac clone cm042f <dig> of contig  <dig>  but no genes associated with heat stress were found in the annotations. snp marker 1_ <dig>  which is  <dig>  cm away from snp 1_ <dig>  was identified in bac clones ch047m <dig> and cm014k <dig> which are also contained within contig <dig> . annotations for ch047m01and cm014k <dig> revealed the presence of two 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthase  <dig> genes as possible candidate genes for the hbs- <dig> locus .table  <dig>

discussion
candidate genes for the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci
synteny between cowpea, soybean, medicago and common bean as well as the integrated genomic resources for cowpea were used to identify ethylene forming enzymes  as the cowpea candidate gene for the hbs- <dig> locus and an acc synthase  <dig> gene for the hbs- <dig> locus. the plant hormone ethylene has long been associated with plants’ ability to systematically relay information regarding abiotic and biotic stress. the biosynthesis of ethylene is dependent on the rate-limiting step; conversion of s-adenosylmethionine  to acc by the enzyme  synthase   <cit> . thus, acs is considered to be the most important enzyme in this pathway. efes are involved in the secondary reaction forming ethylene; oxidation of acc to ethylene  <cit> .

the importance of ethylene closely associated with heat stress has been indicated by several studies. researchers examining heat-induced oxidative damage in arabidopsis showed that ethylene, abscisic acid  and salicylic acid  were key to protecting against heat-induced stress; an ethylene-insensitive mutant ethylene resistant  <dig>  showed an increase of susceptibility to heat  <cit> . in another study, arabidopsis insensitive mutants to ethylene signaling, etr- <dig> and ethylene insensitive  <dig> , showed a significant reduction in tolerance to basal-thermotolerance compared to wild-type  <cit> . munne-bosch et al.  sought to determine if airborne ethylene such as found in highly polluted areas affected plant stress tolerance. they observed that ethylene-fumigated holm oak trees showed much less tolerance to heat stress and heat stress combined with drought stress than controls  <cit> . ethylene treated oak trees showed oxidative stress at 35°c whereas the controls showed a heat tolerance up to 50°c  <cit> . additionally, ethylene treated trees showed more visual leaf area damage than controls  <cit> . investigators of a heat-susceptible hard red winter wheat found that there was a 6-fold increase of ethylene in wheat kernels vs. no change in a heat-tolerant wheat cultivar ‘halberd’  <cit> . similarly, a 7-fold increase of ethylene was produced in embryos and a 12-fold increase of ethylene was found in the flag leaf of the heat-susceptible wheat genotype  <cit> . the fact that ethylene is involved in heat stress regulation in many plant species makes acc synthase and efes plausible candidate genes for regulating heat-induced browning of seed coats in cowpea. it is interesting to note that the two candidate genes for heat-induced brown discoloration in cowpea are two enzymes intricately involved in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the identity of three loci, hbs- <dig>  hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig>  associated with heat-induced browning of seed coats in cowpea. the major heat-induced browning locus, hbs- <dig>  was observed in both ril populations, it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> and it84s- <dig> x tvu <dig>  hbs- <dig> was a minor locus identified in the it93k-503- <dig> x cb <dig> population, while hbs- <dig> was a minor locus observed in the it84s- <dig> x tvu <dig> population. parental lines it93k-503- <dig> and it84s- <dig> both exhibited the heat-induced browning of seed coats trait. the genetic and physical mapping and identity of candidate genes for the hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> loci were conducted utilizing integrated cowpea consensus genetic and physical maps as well as syntenic relationships with soybean, medicago and common bean. the major locus, hbs- <dig>  was narrowed to cowpea bac clone cm018c <dig> of bac contig  <dig> on the cowpea physical map, where ethylene-forming enzymes  were present and considered as putative cowpea candidate genes. the minor locus, hbs- <dig> was positioned on bac clones cm042f <dig>  ch047m <dig> and cm014k <dig> of contig <dig> of the cowpea physical map where acc synthase  <dig> genes were present and considered as potential candidate genes.

the practical outcome of this study was the identification of molecular markers 1_ <dig> and 1_ <dig> co-segregating with the hbs- <dig> phenotype and snp marker 1_ <dig> which co-segregated with the hbs- <dig> phenotype. the heat-induced browning phenotype is present in about 20% of the elite iita breeding lines. since the hbs phenotype is not manifested unless the breeding material is exposed to the appropriate heat conditions, having markers to screen against the trait at the seedling stage would limit the number of plants needed to be grown to maturity. this would enable an efficient selection process to ensure that cowpea cultivars being bred do not carry the heat-induced browning trait. these approaches should expedite variety development by at least halving the current traditional breeding selection process which relies on time-consuming and costly phenotyping under heat stress conditions. future goals include functional analysis of cowpea hbs- <dig> and hbs- <dig> candidate genes, which enhance our understanding of the heat-induced browning phenomenon as well as provide a ‘perfect marker’ which would further improve marker-assisted breeding efficiency.
