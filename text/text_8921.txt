BACKGROUND
brassinosteroids  are plant steroid hormones involved in many processes including cell expansion and division, pollen tube growth, vascular tissue development, senescence and modulation of stress responses  <cit> . plants deficient in brassinosteroids display characteristic phenotypes including severe dwarfism, shortened hypocotyls and round shaped dark green leaves. an analysis of arabidopsis thaliana mutants showing such phenotypes revealed a number of enzymes crucial for production of brs. depending on the affected pathway these enzymes can be divided into two groups: the first is involved in general sterol biosynthesis  and includes dwf <dig>  <cit> , ste1/dwf <dig>  <cit>  and dwf1/cbb <dig>  <cit> . the second group includes dwf <dig>  <cit> , cpd  <cit> , det <dig>  <cit> , rot <dig>  cyp90d <dig>  <cit> , br6ox <dig> and br6ox <dig>  <cit> . these enzymes are involved in the br biosynthesis pathway that starts from the bulk sterol campesterol as a precursor and ultimately yields brassinolide , the most active br . the expression of most enzymes of the br synthesis pathway is negatively regulated by br signalling while transcript levels of enzymes involved in general sterol biosynthesis are not br responsive.

bl is perceived by the receptor kinase bri <dig>  <cit>  and its co-receptor bak <dig>  <cit> , which, unlike animal steroid receptors, localise to the cell membrane. the signal is transduced by the bsk group of receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases  <cit>  and the phosphatase bsu <dig>  <cit>  to asks, a. thaliana gsk-3/shaggy-like kinases, which are inactivated in response to bl. asks are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that can be grouped into four classes  <cit> . several asks are involved br signalling  <cit> , some asks have been shown to play a role in stress responses  <cit> . in the absence of bl the asks are active and can phosphorylate a number of transcription factors including bes <dig>  <cit> , bzr <dig>  <cit>  and their homologues beh <dig> to beh <dig>  <cit> , mybl <dig>  <cit> , spch  <cit>  and presumably also ces  <cit> . interestingly, bin <dig>  and some other asks can also phosphorylate and thereby inactivate yoda  <cit>  and mkk <dig>  <cit> , two protein kinases acting in the map-kinase cascade that regulates spch activity. similar to yoda and mkk <dig> most transcription factors are inhibited by bin2-mediated phosphorylation. for instance, bes <dig> and bzr <dig> can only bind dna in their unphosphorylated form to regulate gene expression  <cit> .

although a number of enzymes involved in sterol and br synthesis and br signalling are known, specific inhibitors are available only for a few of them . recently, the triazole derivative voriconazole was shown to be a potent and specific inhibitor of plant cyp51s. plants treated with this compound showed significantly reduced sterol and brassinosteroid levels and exhibited the typical signs of br deficiency  <cit> .

the observation that the gibberellic acid biosynthesis inhibitor uniconazole has a slight inhibitory effect on brassinosteroid biosynthesis led to the development of brassinazole  <cit>  and brz <dig>  <cit> , two triazole derivatives  that target the heme iron of cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenase dwf <dig>  <cit> . brassinazole has widely been used to study the synthesis and effects of brassinosteroids  <cit> . furthermore, brassinazole was employed in genetic screens to isolate mutants that do not respond to this compound, which enabled the identification of the transcription factor bzr <dig>  <cit> . several other inhibitors of sterol/br biosynthesis are also known including brz <dig>  <cit> , propiconazole  <cit> , ketoconazole  <cit>  and itraconazole  <cit> . however their molecular targets have remained elusive.

high concentrations of lithium ions  are used to inhibit the mammalian kinase gsk3β  <cit>  and plant asks  <cit> . however, lithium lacks specificity  <cit>  and induces severe ion toxicity in plants  <cit> , thus limiting its value for in vivo studies. bikinin was identified by a chemical genetics approach as a compound that mimics bl treatment  <cit> . bikinin is a non-steroidal compound that acts as an atp-competitive inhibitor for plant gsk-3/shaggy-like kinases and thereby induces constitutive brassinosteroid responses. bikinin is the monoamide of succinic acid with 2-amino-5-bromopyridine. the bromine in position  <dig> of the pyridine ring and the carboxylic acid group were recognised as being important for its activity  <cit> . however, a more detailed structure-activity relationship study to reveal the contribution of specific structural elements, for instance length of the aliphatic side chain and position of the heterocyclic nitrogen, is lacking and preliminary data indicated that substitution of bromine by other halogens might lead to more active compounds  <cit> .

here we studied the structural elements necessary for bikinin activity in more detail, which allowed us to isolate derivatives with enhanced activity and, importantly, increased cell-permeability. moreover, we present evidence for the catabolic fate of bikinin and its derivatives after cellular uptake and identify a novel pathway for modification of xenobiotic compounds.

RESULTS
synthesis
to gain more insight into the structural elements important for bikinin activity and to further improve bikinin inhibitor potency, we synthesised a set of bikinin derivates. bikinin and other derivatives were prepared by formation of amides from substituted aminopyridines and cyclic carboxylic acid anhydrides or chlorides of dicarboxylic acid monomethyl esters . in the last case the methyl group was subsequently removed by alkaline hydrolysis, if required. determination of the pka of selected compounds revealed that they are weak acids .

in vitro inhibitor potency
bikinin is a potent inhibitor of group i and group ii asks. askθ, a group iii ask is moderately inhibited. the second kinase of this class, askβ, and the group iv kinase askδ are not inhibited  <cit> . to investigate the inhibitor activity of the set of bikinin derivates on ask activity, representatives of all four ask groups were expressed as recombinant gst fusion proteins in e. coli and the potency of the synthesised compounds  on the selected asks was assayed by in vitro kinase assays using the commonly used artificial substrate myeline basic protein  .compounds  <dig> to  <dig> were assayed to investigate the effect of length variation of the aliphatic side chain. the most active compound, no.  <dig>  had a chain consisting of  <dig> carbons . the glutaryl  and the adipoyl  derivatives clearly had a lower potency while the shorter derivatives  had almost no effect. introduction of a double bond into a side chain of optimal length abolished potency completely  indicating that the steric conformation is highly important. to test whether the carboxy group of the aliphatic chain is essential for activity or if an oxo group is sufficient, we included compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  which are the methyl esters of compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. compound  <dig>  a structural isomer of compound  <dig>  was also tested . as shown in figure  <dig>  the methylated variants showed dramatically reduced inhibitory effects confirming that a terminal carboxy group is essential.

having identified the optimal side chain, we next investigated the influence of the heterocyclic ring in more detail. compounds  <dig> and  <dig> both have an amido succinyl side chain but differ in the position of the heterocyclic nitrogen. in vitro kinase assays revealed that compound  <dig> is more potent , demonstrating that the heterocyclic nitrogen must be adjacent to the position carrying the amido succinic acid substituent.

previous data indicated that a bromine substituent on position  <dig> of the pyridine ring is critical for biological activity of bikinin  <cit> . compounds  <dig> to  <dig> were synthesised to test the effect of other substituents. as indicated in figure  <dig> the chloro, bromo and especially the iodo derivative were highly active while the fluoro compound exhibited a very low potency. the unsubstituted and the nitro derivatives were inactive. quantification of residual kinase activities showed that the inhibitory effect on bin <dig> increased with the atomic number of the halogen substituent while an opposite but less pronounced effect could be observed for askθ .

in summary, active derivatives inhibited askα, bin <dig> and askζ strongly while askθ was moderately inhibited and their effects on askβ and askδ were negligible. active compounds were characterised by an aliphatic c <dig> side chain with a terminal carboxy group and a heterocyclic nitrogen next to the amido group. in addition, a halogen substituent of the aromatic system was crucial. a fluoro residue had only a slightly promotive effect while the chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives were highly active.

in vivo effects of the inhibitors
brassinosteroid deficient plants are severely dwarfed and display dark green, epinastic leaves and shortened hypocotyls. application of 24-epi-brassinolide, a synthetic brassinosteroid, can partially rescue br biosynthesis mutants like cpd <cit>  but does not change the phenotype of br signalling mutants like bri1- <dig> <cit> . in contrast, bikinin can rescue both mutants partially  <cit> . to investigate the in vivo potency of the synthesised derivatives cpd and bri1- <dig> mutants were transferred to media supplemented with these compounds. seedlings treated with active compounds showed expanded leaves, increased hypocotyl lengths and were light green. the potency to rescue the phenotype correlated with the results of the in vitro assay except for compounds  <dig>  and  <dig> , which showed little potency in vitro but were highly active in vivo. because of this unexpected result we compared the bioactivities of compound  <dig>  which has a free carboxy group terminal at its aliphatic side chain, and of compound  <dig>  which is the methylated counterpart. in addition, we also synthesised compound  <dig>  which is the methylated counterpart of bikinin . to obtain quantitative data we measured the impact of these compounds on hypocotyl elongation of a. thaliana, an assay frequently used to investigate br action  <cit> . the methylated compound  <dig> already showed a clear effect on hypocotyl length at  <dig> μm, while approximately  <dig> μm of compound  <dig> were necessary to obtain comparable effects . at such high concentrations compound  <dig> already showed toxic effects that impeded full hypocotyl elongation. similarly, methylated compounds  <dig> and  <dig> showed a much higher biological activity than their unmethylated counterparts  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively . we also compared compound  <dig>  the most active inhibior, and bikinin . compound  <dig> and bikinin had ic <dig> values  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm, respectively , showing that compound  <dig> is  <dig>  times more active in the hypocotyl eleongation assay than the original bikinin.

next we wanted to investigate the potency of the methylated compounds at the molecular level. asks involved in br signalling downregulate the activity of bes1/bzr1-family transcription factors by phosphorylation. this modification causes an electrophoretic mobility shift allowing convenient detection of in vivo ask activity by western blot analysis  <cit> . a. thaliana seedlings expressing bzr1-cfp were treated with different concentrations of compound  <dig> and  <dig> and the bzr <dig> phosphorylation pattern was compared by western blot analysis with that of mock treated plants . both compounds were capable to inducing a shift of bzr1-cfp to its de-phosphorylated form. a comparable result was also obtained for plants expressing bes1-cfp . a similar shift was also seen in a. thaliana protoplasts co-transformed with constructs of cfp-tagged bzr <dig> and myc-tagged askζ after treatment with different concentrations of compounds  <dig> and  <dig> .

thus, surprisingly, the methylated derivatives  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed similar or even higher activities in vivo than their free acid counterparts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, although in in vitro kinase assays the methyl esters had a weaker effect on ask activity.

methylated bikinin derivatives are rapidly hydrolysed in planta
to investigate these conflicting results in more detail, we analysed the fate of compound  <dig> in vivo. seedlings were infiltrated with compound  <dig> and plant extracts subsequently analysed by hplc. only trace amounts of  <dig> could be observed but a novel peak, designated p <dig>  appeared . this peak could be identified by its retention time and its uv spectrum as compound  <dig>  indicating that compound  <dig> is rapidly converted to the highly active compound  <dig> in planta and explaining the different potency of compound  <dig> in vitro and in vivo. prolonged incubation led to formation of two additional peaks, designated p <dig> and p <dig> . the spectra of these two compounds indicate that they are derived from  <dig>  most likely by modification of the aliphatic side chain. similar results were obtained for the pairs 3/ <dig> and 14/ <dig> .

tissue permeability of bikinin derivatives
the previous result that the methylated compounds are rapidly hydrolysed to their corresponding active free acid forms provided an explanation for the observation that the methylated compounds showed little or no activity in vitro while they were highly active in vivo. however, this result could not explain why the methylated derivatives  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed significantly higher in planta activities than their free acid counterparts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively .

the cell-permeability of a substance is an important characteristic for its in vivo potency. thus, we determined the uptake of compounds  <dig> and  <dig> by treatment of a. thaliana seedlings with the compounds and subsequent quantification of their internalised concentrations . since compound  <dig> is rapidly converted to  <dig>  only the in situ concentration of the cleavage product, compound  <dig>  was measured. uptake of both compounds was rapid and the highest in situ concentrations were observed after 3 hours of treatment. it is important to note that the plant internal concentrations exceeded those of the medium. while 50 μm were present in the medium, in situ concentrations of about 90 μm were measured after treatment with compound  <dig> and more than 180 μm after treatment with compound  <dig>  these data show that the methylated inhibitor has an increased cell-permeability as compared to its unmethylated analogue, thus providing an explanation for the increased biological activity of the methylated inhibitors.

catabolic fate of bikinin derivatives
after prolonged inhibitor treatment the in situ concentration of compound  <dig> declined , concomitant with the appearance of additional peaks that had already been observed in the previous experiment . according to the retention times and uv spectra, the same end products, p <dig> and p <dig>  were obtained for compound  <dig> and  <dig> .

organisms can inactivate biologically active xenobiotic compounds by a number of reactions including hydrolysis, oxidation or conjugation with metabolites. however, it has also been reported that modification can activate a previously inactive compound  <cit> . in order to investigated whether the observed modification products of compound  <dig>  namely p <dig>  which according to the previous results represents compound  <dig>  and the two unknown compounds p <dig> and p <dig>  are potent to inhibit asks, we purified the products by solid phase extraction and two fractionations by hplc. as expected from the previous results , the uv spectra of the isolated products p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were nearly identical to that of the compounds  <dig> and  <dig>  indicating that the chromophore, the pyridine ring including the halogen substituent and the amide bond, are still present in the products. this allowed quantification of p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> by hplc and uv detection. the potency of the isolated compounds was subsequently investigated by in vitro kinase assays . as previously determined, modification product p <dig> of compound  <dig> was highly potent to inhibit the kinase activity of bin <dig>  this was expected since p <dig> represents compound  <dig>  in contrast, the modification products p <dig> and p <dig> had no impact on the activity of bin <dig> 

a possible modification mechanism that could explain at least one of the additional peaks would be shortening of the side chain by β-oxidation, a pathway which was first recognised by feeding experiments with synthetic ω-phenyl fatty acids  <cit> . it has also been reported that the plant growth regulator indole-3-butyric acid is activated in planta to indole-3-acetic acid  by a process similar to β-oxidation  <cit> . to investigate whether p <dig> or p <dig> originate from such a process we synthesised compound  <dig>  the expected β-oxidation end product of compound  <dig> . however, the retention time and the uv spectrum of compound  <dig> were distinct from that of p <dig> or p <dig> , ruling out this possibility.

to identify the metabolic products of compound  <dig>  we analysed them by high resolution mass-spectrometry. based on the obtained masses  the only possible chemical formula are c9h9in2o <dig> for p <dig>  c13h13in2o <dig> for p <dig> and c14h16in3o <dig> for p <dig>  this confirms that p <dig> is nearly identical to compound  <dig>  since p <dig> and p <dig> are formed from p <dig>  and their uv spectra are identical to that of compound  <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> are presumably the conjugates of compound  <dig> with glutamic  and malic acid , respectively . the observation of a conjugate with glutamic acid was not surprising since the reaction of amino acids with the carboxyl group of xenobiotics is a widespread reaction in plants  <cit> . to provide additional evidence for the composition of p <dig> we hydrolysed an aliquot and performed amino acid analysis. in the chromatogram a peak corresponding to glutamic acid was clearly visible , confirming that p <dig> is the conjugate of compound  <dig> with glutamic acid.

sng <dig> catalyses conjugation of bikinin derivatives with malate
intriguingly, besides the glutamic acid derivative we could also detect a conjugate of compound  <dig> with malic acid. while conjugates of xenobiotic compounds with malonic and pyruvic acid are common, conjugates with malic acid are less frequently observed  <cit>  and the pathway for their formation remains elusive.

the structure of the malic acid derivative of compound  <dig>  resembles that of sinapoylmalate, one of the major soluble phenolic compounds present in a. thaliana. sinapoylmalate is synthesised by glucosylation of sinapic acid by ugt84a <dig> and its homologues  <cit>  and the subsequent exchange of the glucosyl residue to malate in a reaction catalysed by sng <dig>  <cit> . because of functional redundancy sinapoylglucose is still formed in ugt84a <dig> knock out plants  <cit> . in contrast, biosynthesis of sinapoylmalate is blocked in sng <dig> mutants. to assess whether the malate transferase sng <dig> is necessary for generation of p <dig>  we treated sng <dig> seedlings with compound  <dig> and analysed the plant extract by hplc. while the glutamic acid derivative p <dig> was still present, the malate derivative p <dig> was absent in plants deficient in sng <dig> function , confirming that sng <dig> catalyses formation of the latter. in the chromatogram of the sng <dig> plants another peak appeared close to that of p <dig> while the pronounced peak present at a retention time of  <dig>  min in extracts of col- <dig> plants  was absent. these peaks showed strong fluorescence  and represent sinapoylglucose  and sinapoylmalate . in summary, this result demonstrates that sng <dig> catalyses the conjugation of malate with compound  <dig> 

discussion
mutants are widely and successfully used to investigate different biological processes. the application of specific inhibitors is an interesting alternative approach that may offer several advantages compared to mutant analysis. inhibitors can be used in different genetic backgrounds without the necessity for time consuming crossings. often they are active in a wide range of organisms allowing investigation of species where no mutants are available. in addition, the application of inhibitors can be limited to a specific developmental stage. this is especially important if a mutant is lethal. for instance, cyp <dig> knock out plants die in early seedling stages  <cit>  impeding dissection of the role of cyp <dig> at later developmental stages. this problem could be circumvented by using the specific cyp <dig> inhibitor voriconazole, which revealed that cyp <dig> is highly important for providing precursors for br biosynthesis  <cit> . another remarkable advantage of inhibitors is that they can provide an opportunity to overcome functional redundancy since homologous proteins are often targeted by the same compound. this is especially important for analysis of polyploid organisms but also for gene families. for instance, a. thaliana encodes  <dig> asks  <cit>  with several of them involved in br signalling  <cit> . while dominant gain of function mutants show severe dwarfism  <cit> , knock out mutants of single or even several asks display no or only very slight phenotypes  <cit> . in contrast, plants treated with the ask inhibitor bikinin show the typical signs of constitutive br response including elongated hypocotyls and light-green leaves  <cit>  indicating that most or all asks crucial for br signalling are inhibited. as a consequence, bikinin has become a widely used and valuable tool for studying br signalling. bikinin was originally identified in a chemical genetics screen for compounds mimicking br responses. in vitro kinase assays revealed that it inhibits ask activity by competing for the kinase binding site with atp. docking simulations suggested that the heterocyclic nitrogen may form a hydrogen bond with the backbone amide nitrogen of a conserved valine residue  located in the atp binding site  <cit> . this suggests that the heterocyclic nitrogen is crucial for bikinin activity, which is in perfect agreement with our results. compound  <dig>  which differs from the highly active compound  <dig> only in the position of the heterocyclic nitrogen, was inactive as revealed by in vitro kinase assays. previous results indicated that the activity of the compounds decreases with the atomic number of the halogen substituent in position  <dig> of the pyridine ring  <cit> . however, we found that the fluoro derivative  showed little activity to inhibit any ask while the chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives were highly potent . interestingly, the inhibitory activity of the compounds on bin <dig> increased slightly with the atomic number of the halogen substituent while an opposite although weaker effect was seen for askθ . with respect to that it is important to note that previous docking predictions indicate that the residue interacting with bikinin is a methionine in bin <dig> but a leucine in askθ, which may explain the different potencies of the chloro, bromo and iodo derivatives for these asks.

analysis of a series of compounds differing only in the length of the aliphatic side chain revealed that the inhibitory effect was highest with a side chain of  <dig> carbon atoms and a terminal carboxy group . previous docking simulations indicated that the carboxy group is necessary for interaction with an arginine conserved in the asks   <cit> . since the carboxy group of the aliphatic chain of bikinin has a pka of  <dig>   it is negatively charged at the intracellular ph. thus it likely interacts with the positively charged arginine residue by ionic interactions. in agreement with that the methylated derivatives  <dig> and  <dig>  which are uncharged at a physiological ph, showed little activity in vitro. in sharp contrast to in vitro assays, the methylated derivatives  <dig> and  <dig> were highly active in vivo and partially rescued br mutants. hypocotyl elongation, a typical response to brs, was even more strongly induced by compounds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> than their free acid counterparts  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in addition, dephoshorylation of bzr <dig>  a widely used read out for br signalling, was induced by the methylated compound  <dig> to a similar or higher extent than by the free acid compound  <dig>  although only the latter was capable of inhibiting asks in vitro. the low in vitro effectiveness of the methylated inhibitors on the one hand and their high in vivo potency on the other hand is likely due to their high cellular permeability and the rapid cleavage of the methyl residue in planta, probably by a lipase .

cellular uptake is a key factor determining inhibitor potency. tissue permeability assays revealed that uptake of the compounds, especially methylated ones, was rapid. interestingly, the in situ concentrations exceeded that of the surrounding medium several fold. this can be explained by the pka values of the compounds . for instance, derivative  <dig> has a pka value of  <dig> , which means that at ph  <dig> , the ph of the medium used, 50% of the compound are dissociated and therefore negatively charged while 50% are undissociated. at the intracellular ph of approximately  <dig>   <cit>  less than 3% of the compound is undissociated. since only the undissociated, lipophilic form is expected to pass biomembranes efficiently, the compounds are trapped in the cell and accumulate to concentrations exceeding that of the surrounding medium. this ph-dependent uptake resembles that of the plant hormone auxin, where ph-driven diffusion has been suggested to contribute to transport into the cell  <cit> . the esterified compounds, for instance compound  <dig>  are independent of the ph, highly lipophilic and can pass membranes. in the cell they are rapidly hydrolysed to the corresponding acids, which deprotonate to hydrophilic anions. it is interesting to note that the uptake rate of compound  <dig> was roughly double that of compound  <dig>  which correlates with the portions capable of diffusion through the membrane: while 100% of compound  <dig> are lipophilic, only 50% of compound  <dig> are undissociated and therefore sufficiently lipophilic.

after prolonged incubation the in situ levels of compound  <dig> declined, which was accompanied by the appearance of two peaks designated p <dig> and p <dig>  the uv spectra of these peaks were nearly identical to that of  <dig>  indicating that they contain the same chromophore, namely the pyridine ring with the amido bond and the halogen substituent. this, together with chemical formulas determined by high resolution mass spectrometry, revealed that p <dig> and p <dig> represent the glutamic and malic acid derivatives of compound  <dig>  respectively. while conjugation of xenobiotic compounds with amino acids is a common phenomenon  <cit> , the formation of a conjugate with malic acid was intriguing. the structure of the produced conjugate shows similarity to that of sinapoylmalate and thus we speculated that both compounds might be formed by the same enzyme. indeed, formation of the malate conjugate of compound  <dig> was abolished in the sng <dig> mutant . sng <dig> is a transferase catalysing the formation of sinapolymalate from sinapoylglucose by exchange of the sugar residue for malic acid. this suggests that compound  <dig> is glucosylated in planta prior to conjugation with malic acid  although we could not observe glucosylated compound  <dig> in the chromatogram. in this respect it is worth noting that sinapoylglucose is hardly detectable in col- <dig> plants since, once formed, the glucose residue is immediately exchanged to malate by sng <dig>  indicating that, in a similar manner to sinapoylglucose, glucosylated compound  <dig> might be rapidly metabolised.

CONCLUSIONS
the compounds  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were highly potent in vitro with the iodo derivative  showing the highest inhibitory effect on bin <dig> and the chloro derivative  being most active against askθ. in vivo the methylated counterparts were more active, since they were significantly better taken up by plants and were immediately hydrolysed in planta to the active compounds. thus, we propose the methylated derivatives of bikinin as inhibitors of choice for in vivo studies, especially if a rapid inhibition of asks is desired. bikinin and its derivates are only temporarily active in plants which might be useful to dissect the role of ask in a defined time window. the inactivation of the inhibitors by conjugation with malate involving sng <dig> represents a novel pathway for modification of xenobiotic compounds and opens up new directions for studying the fate of xenobiotics in plants.
