BACKGROUND
human behaviours are characterised by marked differences on both the population and individual level. the two evolutionary-conserved neurohypophyseal hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin and their receptors play key roles in modulating cognition and social behaviours in mammals  <cit> . the corresponding genes are expressed mainly in the hypothalamus and secreted from the posterior pituitary gland. the main hormonal activity of oxytocin is to regulate parturition and lactation. vasopressin, in contrast, regulates salt and water homeostasis. the neurophysiological effects of oxytocin are shown in facilitating social communication, affiliative behaviours, and social cognition. accordingly, oxytocin has been reported to influence maternal behaviour, trust, generosity, empathy, eye contact, face memory, and also to reduce anxiety  <cit> . vasopressin expressed in the brain modulates social behaviours in sexually dimorphic ways, including anxiety-related behaviour as shown in animal studies, and may act to enhance social recognition and the emotional response to stress . similar effects have also been reported in humans, especially with regard to aggression and the perception of anger  <cit> . for instance, cerebrospinal fluid levels of vasopressin are directly correlated with general aggression and aggression against persons  <cit> . vasopressin may influence aggression in males by priming individuals to respond to emotionally ambiguous social stimuli as if they were threatening or aggressive  <cit> . additionally, genetic variation within the avpr1a gene, particular in the 5′ upstream region  in both humans and chimpanzees, has been linked to relationship quality and pair bonding  <cit> , personality traits  <cit> , and autism disorders  <cit> . in particular, polymorphic microsatellites in the 5′ flanking promoter region have been associated with species-specific and individual variation in social behavior in mice  <cit> . furthermore, two snps  have been identified in the promoter region of the human avpr1a gene, which were significantly associated with autism in korean subjects  <cit> .

the physiological effects of these two neuroactive peptides are mediated via their specific receptor molecules, encoded by the oxytocin receptor gene  and arginine vasopressin receptor 1a gene . these two genes share a feature unique to the g protein–coupled receptor genes: an intron located before the seventh transmembrane domain of the receptor encoding sequences  <cit> . in several species, polymorphisms in these genes, mainly in the non-coding regions, have been linked to inter-individual variation in cognition and social behaviours  <cit> .

recently, it has been reported that polymorphisms in the oxtr gene are associated with the development of psychopathy, for example in children with conduct problems or with callous and unemotional traits  <cit> . intronic snps on oxtr are further associated with autistic spectrum disorder . nonetheless. alleles appear to have opposite effects in asian compared to caucasian populations . polymorphisms in and near the 3′utr is also involved in asd risk  <cit> . a recent meta-analysis including  <dig> individuals from  <dig> independent samples and  <dig> snps on oxtr, however, found a significant association with asd for only  <dig> snps   <cit> . in addition, specific sequence variants of oxtr are associated with the asperger syndrome  <cit> . finally, an allelic variation of rs <dig> on oxtr apparently influences human empathy  <cit> , and various snp variations are associated with maternal sensitivity  <cit>  and parental touch provision  <cit> ; rs <dig> on oxtr plays also a role in pair-bonding  <cit> .

additionally, support seeking is associated with rs <dig> on oxtr as well, but again different in caucasian americans compared with koreans  <cit> . rs <dig> is also associated with pro-sociality: kogan et al.  <cit>  reported that individuals homozygous for the g allele on rs <dig> were rated more pro-social than carriers of the a allele. moreover, rs <dig> influences trust behaviour  <cit> , stress reactivity  <cit> , and lower self- reported affect  <cit> . there is also evidence that oxtr snps  help process social information from the emotion expression of faces and the voice  <cit> .

in economic games, snps on oxtr play a role, too: israel et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the snps rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> on oxtr intron  <dig> are associated with performance in the dictator game and the social value task. although this association also holds true in an independent female sample  <cit> , in a swedish population  neither associations reported by isreal et al.  <cit> , nor any association with rs <dig>  could be confirmed. extensive reviews of oxtr associations can be found in  <cit>  and  <cit> .

thus, oxytocin and its specific receptor are crucial for a range of social behaviours and disorders associated with social dis-functioning. moreover, oxytocin-related cultural differences in social behaviour exist among different human populations  <cit> .

in summary, these studies suggest that genetic variation, particularly in the non-coding dna, of both neuroreceptor genes significantly influences social behaviour in humans. little, however, is known about whether positive selection may have shaped sequence variation at loci involved in social cognition. in most studies, genes that show signatures of positive selection usually include loci involved in host–pathogen interactions, reproduction, dietary adaptation, and skin and hair coloration  <cit> .

only two studies have so far reported positive selection for genes involved in human behaviours. ding et al.  <cit>  suggested that the seven-repeat variant of the dopamine receptor gene d <dig>  originated as a rare mutational event, but increased to high frequency in human populations due to positive selection . the allele drd <dig> 7r is reportedly associated with certain psychiatric phenotypes such as the attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder   <cit> . the other study reported an excess of high frequency-derived haplotypes for the monoamine oxidase a gene , perhaps reflecting recent positive selection  <cit> . this gene shows association with borderline mental retardations, depression, and psychopathy .

in the present study, we thus examined whether positive selection has shaped the polymorphism in the oxtr and avpr1a genes. we utilized large snp datasets released by the  <dig> genomes project   <cit> . we used the degree of genetic differentiation  over many worldwide populations as a proxy for positive selection at the snp level. this approach enables detecting the signature of recent positive selection in human populations. we further investigated whether any snps identified under selection are known to be associated with human behavioural traits.

the snp rs <dig> also unfolds the regression tree  and is characterised by an fst

the snp rs <dig>  which is under balancing selection, is located within a ctcf  transcription factor binding sequence. the ctcf protein acts as a transcriptional regulator and is implicated in genomic imprinting. in addition, fdist detected the upstream gene snp variants rs <dig> and rs <dig> to be under balancing selection .

detecting selection in the avpr1a gene
even though some snps on the avpr1a gene unfold the regression tree , no snps were detected under directional selection by the fdist and bayescan approaches. the flk test, however, detected the snp rs <dig>  which is located in the promotor region of avpr1a, as being under directional selection .fig.  <dig> regressions tree of the  <dig> snps of the avpr1a regressing on the  <dig> human populations from 1000genomes. the regression trees shows the snps  according to which the  <dig> population do separate from each other

this result should be treated with caution because only flk detected this snp as being under positive selection. nonetheless, fdist and bayscan identified the snp rs <dig>  and the snp rs <dig>  to be under balancing selection . the apvr1a upstream snp rs <dig> is located within the transposable element hat-charlie family dna transposon , which is an element found only in mammals and plays an important role in gene regulation  <cit> . furthermore, fdist also identified several other snps as being significantly  under balancing selection. the bayescan approach detected at the level of log  <dig> 1 →  <dig>  , congruent with fdist, the following snps as being under selection: rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  fst values and detailed results from fdist and bayescan for all loci on oxtr, respectively on avpr <dig> are displayed.fig.  <dig> detection of outlier snps of the avpr1a gene using fdist. fdist suggests the snps rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  rs <dig>  and rs <dig> are under balancing selection. x-axis: estimated heterozygosity values; y-axis: f

discussion
this study shows that, the oxtr intronic snp rs <dig> detected as being under balancing selection is associated with reactions to betrayal  <cit>  as well as the autism spectrum disorder . interestingly, this snp is located within a ctcf  transcription factor binding motif, which is recognised by the ctcf ) transcription factor. this transcriptional regulator protein, which can activate or repress transcription, is associated with diseases that include mental retardation  <cit> . it remains unknown whether this transcription factor influences the gene expression of the oxtr gene.

in the avpr1a gene, at least two of the three approaches detected the snps rs <dig> and rs <dig> as being under balancing selection. for the snp rs <dig>  no phenotypic associations are reported yet. the snp rs <dig>  however, is located in a dna transposon sequence region  found only in placental mammals  <cit> . this transposon family a) has the epigenetic signatures of enhancers, insulators, and repressors, b) directly binds transcription factors essential for pregnancy, and c) coordinately regulates gene expression in response to progesterone and camp  <cit> . the latter study concluded that this transposable element contributed to the origin of a novel gene regulatory network dedicated to pregnancy in placental mammals.

on avpr1a the signature of balancing selection could be adaptive because of the pleiotropic function of this gene. in addition, fdist  1 →  <dig> , i.e., ‘strong evidence’ for selection) detected congruently several more snps under selection in the avpr1a gene. from these snps under selection, rs <dig> and rs <dig> are located in important regulatory sequences. the snp rs <dig> is located in potential microrna binding sites  <cit> . studies suggest that microrna binding sites in the 3′utr are potent regulators of gene expression in animals. indeed, this snp has been found to be associated with expression levels of the avpr1a gene in human brain tissue  <cit> . interestingly, this locus is associated with risk of drug use disorders in humans  <cit> . the snp rs <dig> is located within several transcription factor binding sequences, such as for the enhancer and for the transcriptional repressor that repress neuronal genes in non-neuronal tissues. it remains unknown whether this snp influences the expression of this gene. nonetheless, as we had access to snp data only from  <dig> genomes, we were unable to include the repeat regions in the promotor of avpr1a, previously identified as being related to social behaviour, in our analysis. this prohibits drawing definitive conclusions about a particularly directional selection of avpr1a .

besides balancing selection, we also found strong evidence of positive directional selection. this was detected by all three used approaches in the intron  <dig> of the oxtr gene , indicating adaptive evolution at this locus. very recently, myers et al.  <cit>  found evidence that rs <dig> modulates the relationship between early life stress and the risk of anxiety later in life. additionally, rs <dig> is in high ld  with an array of snps of known social behavioural associations including: mind-reading, empathy , psychopathy , autism spectrum disorder , adhd ,  and pro-social behaviour in cooperation games .

interestingly a comparison among primate species reveals that, in humans, the reference allele of rs <dig> is g, but a in the chimp, orang-utan and the macaque. among these latter species, rs59190448seems to be in an area of accelerated evolution .

the regression tree of the genotype regressing on the ethnical affiliation for the oxtr gene may hint at actual population differentiation. the snp rs <dig> splits the regression tree at its root into the african populations lwk and yri on one branch and all the other populations on the other branches. the branch with the other non-african populations is consecutively split, separating the two chinese populations  from the others, by rs <dig>  recently found to be associated with reactions to betrayal  <cit> . this is followed by the japanese population , then the european populations  and the mexican population  – suggesting a further differentiation into populations  according to allele frequencies. the question now is whether the branching is reflected in population differences in behaviour. although the direct link between behaviour and variation in the oxtr gene is still missing, one hint might come from population differences in human socio-spatial behaviour: interpersonal proximity and touch varies between so-called contact cultures  and non-contact cultures  .

although we found no signs of positive selection for the intronic snp rs <dig>  we did find that it is in ld’ at  <dig>  with rs <dig> in europeans, and in ld’ at  <dig>  with rs <dig> and rs <dig> in east asians. and indeed, rs <dig> on oxtr has been identified as having a different allelic association depending on the cultural context. this was already exemplified in the introduction section: according to  <cit> , the emotionally sensitive g allele carriers seek more social support than the aa genotypes, but only in european americans. in east asians, in contrast, where emotional support seeking is not the cultural norm, this behaviour is not related to rs <dig>  kim et al.  <cit>  further found that different alleles of rs <dig> are differently associated with emotional suppression in european americans and koreans: among koreans, emotional suppression was associated with the rs <dig> gg genotype, which is characterized as more socio-emotionally sensitive, but not with the aa genotype. in contrast, americans with the gg genotype were less engaged in emotional suppression compared to those with the aa genotype. ethnic differences between east asians and europeans have also been found for an autistic spectrum disorders risk allele on oxtr . finally, oxytocin influences the inter-individual distance between men and women. in an experiment including only female participants, oxytocin-treated women significantly reduced the “comfortable distance” to a male experimenter but not to a female experimenter  <cit> . based on this result, it could be speculated – and tested by future studies – that the differences on the oxtr gene also contribute to the known cultural differences in body contact and individual space  <cit> . nonetheless, these cultural differences do not preclude that second-generation immigrants adopt local norms if they are well-integrated into their host societies.

additionally, differences in oxtr alleles could result in different regulation of social behaviours and emotions among diverse human cultures. for example, facial expressions are important cues used in social interactions and interpretations of emotional states  <cit> . interestingly, the perception of facial signals is not universal among human societies  <cit> . jack et al.  <cit>  found differences in the organization of the conceptual space of emotions between east asians and western caucasians. interestingly, a very recent study showed, for oxtr, a relationship to emotional empathy, whereas avpr1a was associated with cognitive empathy  <cit> . accordingly, our results suggest that molecular biological differences in oxtr alleles may also be related to different perception or cognition of emotions among different socio-ecologically adapted societies. we may therefore speculate that directional selection processes on oxtr are also associated with the ability to perceive different emotional states  in diverse human societies. the cognitive part of emotional perception mediated via avpr1a, however, could be universal for all human societies. as noted above, conclusions on selection on avpr1a might be limited because the repetitive sequences in the promotor region were not included in our analysis.

cultural differences are also found in asd, which is associated with a preference for greater inter-individual distance  <cit> . asd has a lower prevalence in afro-american children than in children with caucasian ancestry  <cit> . nonetheless, any conclusions that ethnic differences in asd are associated with selection on the oxtr gene would be premature: despite several snps on oxtr having been identified as being associated with asd , the association of oxtr with asd is weaker than the association of asd with other genes. the simons research foundation for autism research  identified  <dig> human genes associated with asd. compared with other genes involved in asd, oxtr scores only with “suggestive evidence” . at least in african populations, however, rs <dig> is in high ld’  with rs <dig>  the snp, for which an association with autism has been primarily described by wu et al.  <cit>  and confirmed in a meta-analysis by  <cit> .

of special interest are our results of the positive directional selection of one snp located in intron  <dig> and the balancing selection in cis-regulative sequences in the 1receptor. these selection processes might reflect adaptations to diverse climate environments or climate changes per se. darwin noted the challenges of climate changes for the behaviour and survivorship in human evolution in relation to natural selection and compared theses challenges with other animals  <cit> . such climate changes have a tremendous influence on terrestrial habitats and therefore on resource availability and body physiology  <cit> . while major genetic changes in body metabolism could have lethal results, behavioural changes for better adaptation to survive in different environments seem to be less risky. our results could reflect such adaptation processes in humans living under different environmental conditions, i.e., signatures of balancing selection stabilize metabolic processes, and directional selection processes enable these populations to develop adaptive behavioural strategies. both processes would improve survivorship and reproductive success.

we used very stringent criteria to test for positive selection in the present study to minimise false positives. we might therefore actually underestimate the level of positive selection acting on regulative sequences in both genes. indeed, a recent study suggests that balancing selection, as a natural consequence of frequent adaptation, is a crucial force maintaining genetic variation  <cit> . many functionally important sequence variants are located in this cis-regulatory sequences, playing an important role in the evolution of species-specific expression of genes, and very likely also in individual-specific variation within species. transcription factor binding sites and other cis-regulatory sequences can be particularly important in the evolutionary adaptation of humans. this is because regulatory elements apparently contribute substantially to both adaptive substitutions and deleterious polymorphisms, with key implications for human evolution and disease  <cit> . adaptation-driven balanced polymorphisms could therefore be an important source of consequential genetic variation at genes involved in social cognition.

balancing selection could be particularly beneficial in fast-changing environments in which diverse human social behaviour patterns might provide an evolutionary adaptive advantage. however, certain variants under selection are linked to detrimental behaviours in humans. these genes with their pleotropic function may therefore maintain balanced polymorphisms that become deleterious in a certain environmental context. the identification of specific positive selection forces on snps relevant to gene expression and social behaviour is a promising novel direction for formulating hypotheses about driving forces and constraints in the evolution of human behaviour and social bonding. likewise, this new approach can provide explanations and context-dependent predictions about within- and between-culture variation in non-verbal behaviour such as interpersonal proximity.

to date, research has strongly concentrated on identifying the genetic basis of social cognition, behaviour, and mental diseases on an individual basis. we assume that the evidence that particularly positive selection has been acting at a snp on the oxtr gene highlights the importance of a “population perspective”. here, differences between populations due to evolutionary processes should be kept in mind when investigating the genetic predisposition of human behaviour, cognition, and mental diseases. a hint about such differences could be the culturally dependent effects of rs <dig> and rs <dig> on emotional support seeking, empathy, and asd  <cit> , both in high ld’ with rs <dig>  this call for taking potential selection pressures during the relatively recent evolution of homo sapiens into account.

more generally, the detection of selection in human genes relevant to behaviour could be a starting point for investigating phenotypical associations. this would involve searching for behavioural and cognitive associations with snps detected as being under selection as well as snps being in high ld’ with a snp under selection.

CONCLUSIONS
this study investigates – based on  <dig> genomes data and using three established methods of selection detection – if a positive selection pressure has been acting on the oxytocin receptor gene  and vasopressin receptor gene . only for one snp on the oxtr gene  was a sign of positive directional selection detected with all three methods of selection detection. for rs <dig>  however, only one phenotypical association is known, but rs <dig> is in high ld’ , with variants associated with important pro-social behaviours and mental disorders in humans. we also detected various signatures of balancing selection on both neuroreceptor genes. possible causes for these findings during the evolution and migration of homo sapiens are discussed, ranging from climate adaptations to social behaviour.
