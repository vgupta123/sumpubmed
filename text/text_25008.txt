BACKGROUND
bdellovibrio bacteriovorus  is an intra-periplasmic predator of diverse gram-negative bacteria. in “attack phase”, the small, vibroid and uniflagellate b. bacteriovorus cells collide with and invade bacterial prey wherein they replicate. despite this provision of nutrition by prey, b. bacteriovorus retains a large  <dig>  mb genome, as the sequence of the terrestrial type-strain hd100
 <cit>  shows. the gene content is large for two main reasons:

firstly, entry into and digestion of another bacterium requires coding of an arsenal of hydrolytic enzymes and sensor regulator systems. the evolutionary pay-off is the opportunity to exclusively use the internal contents of another bacterium as food, without competition from other bacteria; the outer membrane of the prey is resealed and macromolecules do not leak from it. in addition, the invaded prey cell, known as the “bdelloplast”, forms a protective barrier against potential environmental insults while the bdellovibrio replicate.

secondly, lifestyle switching by bdellovibrio to grow prey-independently on conventional carbon sources may also contribute to the large genome size, but this switching has been found rarely in cultivated “attack phase” bdellovibrio. a small fraction of cells  from predatory laboratory cultures of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> can be isolated and shown to grow slowly prey-independently on complex peptone-yeast extract based media
 <cit> . these  cells grow as long filaments which septate into multiple progeny, some of which are of attack phase size and some are longer serpentine cells. this suggests that some genes for cell elongation, regulatory and alternative degradative-enzymes may be retained in the hd <dig> genome to allow this alternative, non-predatory lifestyle. the low frequency of isolation host-independently growing b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> or 109j suggests a mutational event is required to activate such prey-independent growth. the site of such mutations has been reported to be in gene bd <dig> which has homology to part of a typeivb pilus operon
 <cit> . however, it has been impossible to measure the extent to which prey-independent growth of bdellovibrio happens in natural environments, or whether it is a laboratory phenomenon. thus bdellovibrio are seen as “versitalists” because they prey on diverse bacteria and, at least in the lab, have some prey-independent growth potential after mutational events
 <cit> .

predatory life brings with it an unusual degree of interaction between bdellovibrio and other bacteria, and thus potential sources of lateral gene transfer . however, the degradation of the prey also includes the degradation from complex polymers  and re-use of prey nucleic acids. thus a range of nucleases are employed by bdellovibrio and possibly act against lgt during predator–prey interactions
 <cit> . initial observations, based on a simple examination of gc skew of genes in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome, suggested that horizontal transfer of foreign dna was not readily occurring in this bacterium. however, later in silico studies of nearest bdellovibrio gene homologues by the doolittle lab found evidence of ancient lgt from outside the delta-proteobacteria clade
 <cit> . more recently pan and co-workers used a codon bias analysis of the b. bacteriovorous hd <dig> genome to suggest that at-rich genes were recently transferred from other bacterial species to bdellovibrio <cit> . to date no other b. bacteriovorus genome sequences have been published, although wurtzel and co-workers have described the partial sequence of b. bacteriovorus 109j
 <cit> . therefore in this study, we have analysed the genome of a different strain of b. bacteriovorus, which has been freshly isolated from an organically polluted and diversely-bacterially populated river - the river tiber in rome
 <cit> . the river tiber is geographically distant from the german terrestrial site of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> isolation
 <cit>  and has high historic inputs of faecal bacteria, dissolved carbon from sewage, industrial chemicals, plus aquatic and marine bacteria
 <cit> . in this river environment the opportunity for lgt between bacterial species should have been quite high.

here we provide the first full comparative genomic analysis for bdellovibrio bacteriovorus. we discover that, unlike the lab strain hd <dig>  b. bacteriovorus tiberius can simultaneously grow predatorily and prey/host-independently, extending its previous “versitalist” designation
 <cit>  to new extremes. we discuss the impacts on lgt that this has had and provide experimental evidence that concurs with previously published in silico evidence from hd <dig> genome analysis, for the extent of ancient and more recent lgt in shaping the bdellovibrio bacteriovorus genome.

RESULTS
in contrast to other bdellovibrio, b. bacteriovorus tiberius grows both prey-independently and predatorily simultaneously
predatory cultures of well-studied b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> and 109j form clear plaques on prey lawns ) and are composed solely of vibroid attack-phase cells. however, pure, predatory cultures of the tiberius strain formed plaques on e. coli lawns each containing a central zone where a small bdellovibrio micro-colony was seen ). b. bacteriovorus tiberius from the plaques and the predatory liquid cultures derived from them, contained a mix of vibroid and long serpentine morphotypes the latter with spherical regions . the long cells resembled axenically-growing prey/host-independent  bdellovibrio, reported by friedberg
 <cit>  and reiner and shilo
 <cit> . the distinctive colony-centred plaques continued even after serial passage of the strain, derived from single plaques, predatorily, repeatedly on prey showing that pure cultures contain both cell types. that a pure strain had been isolated was backed up by examination of restriction digest and southern blot hybridisation patterns for dna derived from multiple cultures of the tiberius strain  no variation was detected which would have indicated two strains rather than one. the 16srrna gene amplified from the genomic dna of the tiberius strain cultures gave a single uniform sequence which was used to position the bacterium on a phylogenetic tree  where it clustered with bdellovibrio bacteriovorus  strains, including the type strain hd <dig> and the well-characterised lab strain 109j
 <cit> .

despite the presence of large serpentine cells in cultures; the b. bacteriovorus tiberius were also clearly preying upon, and reducing, e. coli prey numbers. time lapse microscopy  showed simultaneous growth and division of the long serpentine b. bacteriovorus tiberius cells in predatory cultures  at the same time as e. coli prey in the cultures were being invaded by the small vibroid b. bacteriovorus tiberius cells. the unusual predatory & prey-independent growth behavior of this bdellovibrio was confirmed in three further experimental approaches: these included: , timelapse microscopy of septating bdellovibrio within a maturing bdelloplast while a prey-independent cell elongated adjacently;  increasing cell number of a spontaneous streptomycin resistant derivative of b. bacteriovorus tiberius, taken directly from a predatory culture into py medium, ; , evidence by viable counts that e. coli were killed and that, concomitantly, b. bacteriovorus tiberius cells increased in number. thus the processes of predation and hi growth which are separate in previously studied b. bacteriovorus strains such as hd <dig>  were occurring simultaneously in b. bacteriovorus tiberius, even when the b. bacteriovorus tiberius was in buffer with prey cells, rather than suspended in a medium rich in organic nutrients, as is required for hi growth by typical hi strains of bdellovibrio .

the coexistence of prey-independent and predatory cells raises the possibility of cannibalism, with predatory bdellovibrio possibly attacking prey-independent bdellovibrio. this could have explained the sphaeroplast structures observed in many hi cultures
 <cit> , so to investigate this possibility, we tagged the abundant nuclear binding protein huaa with both mcherry and tfp and co-incubated the resulting tiberius and hd <dig> strains for several days, both as predatory cultures, hi cultures, and mixtures of the two. despite this, we saw no convincing evidence of co-incidence of mcherry and tfp within any structures. we therefore conclude that the sphaeroplast structures observed are a normal feature of hi morphology, possibly sometimes caused by damage and not  the result of cannibalism. that neither hd <dig> nor tiberius strains used each other as prey, is consistent with previous observations for other bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strains. this suggests that bdellovibrio have outer-membranes different to those from the broad range of other gram- negative outer membranes which they attach to, and invade
 <cit> .

tiberius and hd <dig> genomes are highly conserved despite different growth cycle switching controls, but diversity reflective of lgt and different selective pressures in diverse habitats was detected
we had initially chosen to compare the genome of a bdellovibrio bacteriovorus from an environment with many sources of potential lgt, to that of the previously sequenced hd <dig> strain, to see if the in silico predictions of lgt in the hd <dig> genome were in evidence. our hypothesis was that predicted “ancient lgt genes” would be more conserved between the two strains and that “recent lgt genes” may differ more between strains. as we discovered experimentally that the tiberius strain also had differences to hd <dig> in its predatory versus prey-independent growth control, we also noted genes associated with those phenotypes .

despite the differences in predatory versus prey-independent lifestyle regulation and terrestrial versus aquatic environments; there was extensive synteny , approximate conservation of genome size , codon usage and conservation of the number and loci of rrna and trna genes  . there were however differences in genomic content which were analysed further.
 <cit>  was used to compare the genomes of the  tiberius and  hd <dig> strains. the circles represent : cds on plus strand; cds on minus strand; trnas  and rrna operons ; regions of homology between the two genomes ; % gc plot ; and gc skew .

manual blastp analysis  was used initially to compare the gene families of each of the predicted proteins encoded by each genome, this would identify genes as “conserved” if they belonged to the same gene families or were paralogous genes. a cut-off of an e-value of 10- <dig> was used as described in materials and methods section. this manual analysis predicted that there were  <dig> genes present in the tiberius genome that were not present in the hd <dig> genome and that there were  <dig> genes in the hd <dig> genome that were not present in the tiberius genome . manual blast analysis might have been underestimating the number of differences between strains by calling paralogs as if they were orthologs.

reciprocal smallest distance analysis 
 <cit>  was used to identify true orthologs in both genomes as this identified paralogs miscalled manually as orthologs. rsd predicted that there were  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs present in both genomes.  this inferred that there were  <dig> genes present in tiberius but not in hd <dig> and  <dig> genes present in hd <dig> but not in tiberius . the sets of unique genes identified by rsd included all  <dig> genes identified by manual blast as unique in the tiberius strain and all except  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes identified by manual blast as unique in strain hd <dig>  these different genes were either not inherited from the last common ancestor of tiberius and hd <dig> and so could represent paralogs on a divergent evolutionary path or examples of lgt, or have been subjected to differential gene loss since the last common ancestor, although this is less likely when the small evolutionary distance between the two strains is considered.

the loci of the genes present only in the tiberius genome or the present only in the hd <dig>  were generally evenly positioned around the bdellovibrio genomes, without strong positional bias for proximity or distance from origin or termination regions with some evidence of gene clusters as well as single insertion-deletions. in the cases of large gene insertions, the differences were obvious on the dnaplotter map of each genome by the difference in g+c %, with most areas of insertion corresponding to areas with below average g+c content .

mobile dna elements, translocated genes and gene islands at trnas
the tiberius strain contained more phage and is element dnas than the hd <dig> strain and, suggestive of mobile dna actions, these may well have contributed to some of the extra gene content in tiberius versus hd <dig> although there were no obvious complete phage sequences .

trnascan
 <cit>  showed the presence of  <dig> trnas  in tiberius; one less  than in the hd <dig> genome. examination of the codon usage of tiberius versus hd <dig> for pro codons did not show a significant difference, suggesting that “wobble” base pairing by other trnas allows translation of pro codons. the ribosomal rna database  shows that this number of trnas is comparably low for a  free-living bacterium, as those with similar numbers are typically parasites or symbionts. the number of rrna genes was conserved between strains and they occurred in two sets whose genomic position appeared conserved between strains.

there was a strong locus-association of strain-specific genomic differences with trnas, with unique gene islands being found at several trnas , but also at other loci . there were also  <dig> single different genes with hypothetical annotations inserted uniquely at the following trnas: bdt <dig>  bdt <dig>  bdt <dig> and bdt <dig> in strain tiberius and at trna <dig>  trna <dig>  trna <dig> and trna <dig> in strain hd <dig>  the prevalence of gene insertion at trnas suggests that integrative and conjugative ice-like elements, which have significant preferences for insertion at trna loci
 <cit> , could be shaping the evolution of genome diversity in b. bacteriovorus by lgt. there were  <dig> insertions into the tiberius genome at genes bdt <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  of an identical transposase gene. this encoded a transposase that was homologous  to those from integrative conjugative elements  which are associated with genome evolution in enteric pathogens
 <cit> . a region of diversity between strains in the tiberius genome around bdt2597-bdt <dig> had to be closed by manual sequencing due to assembly of the  <dig> sequencing being poor due to the two proximal identical ice elements.

in silico predictions of ancient and modern lateral gene transfer in hd <dig> are supported by genomic comparisons between hd <dig> and tiberius strains
gophna and coworkers identified  <dig> genes in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome that, although their codon usage was not aberrant, had highest homology with genes from other bacterial genera, outside the deltaproteobacteria. they highlighted strongest homology for  <dig> of these and starred  <dig> in the som to their paper as having potential relevance to predatory activity
 <cit> . they suggested that the lateral transfer of these genes into the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome may have been anciently associated with its predatory evolution. in support of this suggestion we observe  that only 52/ <dig>  of these  <dig> “anciently laterally transferred genes” found in the hd <dig> genome were not also present in the tiberius genome. of the subset of  <dig> “ancient lgt” genes which gophna starred in the hd <dig> genome as having predicted “predatory relevance”, only  <dig>  were found by blast  and by rsd analysis these  <dig> and a further  <dig>   were found not to be conserved in tiberius. the finding of ~91-92% of such “anciently acquired” hd <dig> genes present also in the tiberius genome suggests, as the doolittle lab predicted, that they may contribute to shaping the evolution for predation of bdellovibrio and thus that genome flux has not led many of them to be lost, because they employ useful roles and thus their codon usage has become ameliorated to that of the bdellovibrio core codon usage.

in contrast, a more recent study of codon bias in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome by pan and co-workers predicted that  <dig> genes with at rich codon bias, had been potentially recently laterally transferred from other bacteria
 <cit> . of these  <dig>  we found  that only  <dig>  were present in the b. bacteriovorus tiberius genome, and this was refined by rsd analysis  to only  <dig> genes  of the pan and co-workers “recent lgt” list being conserved in both tiberius and hd <dig> strains. these genes were bd <dig>  bd <dig> and bd <dig>  this finding lends support to the idea that these  <dig> genes may have been laterally acquired more recently in evolution in b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> and thus are not necessarily found in the tiberius strain.

thus the experimental isolation and sequencing of the tiberius strain, from a different environment to strain hd <dig>  does support the in silico predictions
 <cit>  garnered from analyses of phylogeny and codon usage in the genome of the single type strain hd <dig> by evolutionary geneticists.

potential significance and lgt sources of genes present in b. bacteriovorus tiberius, but not hd100
the tiberius strain genome contains 312/ <dig> genes that manual blast/rsd analysis  defines as not present in the genome of hd <dig>  approximately half of these are designated hypothetical and  <dig> -15% conserved-hypothetical. some of these gene products  may be associated with the degradation, by prey-independently growing b. bacteriovorus tiberius, of molecules from a river that is reported to be polluted with aromatic hydrocarbons, industrial and farming effluents and sewage
 <cit> . other tiberius-only genes  are predicted to encode transporters that may efflux toxic compounds found in the river.

more than twenty tiberius-only genes are suggestive of mobile dna transfer events including the  <dig> identical is element genes mentioned above and the additional phage/nuclease genes , nucleic acid modifying genes and toxin antitoxin genes . of the tiberius-only genes from the manually examined blast analysis, there were  <dig> putative regulatory genes whose products may have roles in the simultaneous predatory and prey-independent growth of tiberius: two with sigma factor homology and  <dig> with marr, fur, lysr, arac or other regulator homologies.  <dig> genes were predicted to encode proteins with modifying  or hydrolytic activities against proteins and carbohydrates, including peptidoglycan deacetylase and lytic transglycosylase activities which may facilitate new pathways of cell wall growth.

 <dig> tiberius-only genes had predicted products that may modify the bdellovibrio cell surface including putative adhesions, lps modification or pilus fibre modification genes and secreted and membrane proteins, including a single pas domain putative sensory protein. these gene products would reflect different surfaces present in the river environment for adhesion. there was a single gene, bdt <dig>  with rela/spot homology that may encode the alteration of ppgpp levels- this is worthy of future investigation as ppgpp signals bacterial amino-acid starvation and the abnormal co-growth of both prey-independent and predatory b. bacteriovorus tiberius in dilute buffers plus prey cell debris only, could be affected by this.

lgt will account for the presence of some of these tiberius specific genes and evidence in support of this came from looking at the microbial source of the highest similarity homologue. these included aquatic and marine bacteria: cyanothece , acaryochloris , anabaena , nostoc, roseiflexus , rhodospirillum , lutiella , hahella , marinomonas , microscilla , marinobacter , and natronamonas, , an archaeon from high salt, ammonia rich environments. this totals  <dig> of the  <dig> tiberius-only genes  with homology to genes from members of other bacterial species.

there were a few examples of evidence of transfer from soil and plant associated bacteria into tiberius, including rhizobium and pseudomonas . there was evidence suggestive of transfer  occurring with genes from some pollutant bacteria, reported to be in the tiber such as clostridium and others including vibrio, eggerthella and shewanella species , which would be common in a faecal pollutants or anaerobic sludges
 <cit> . these include bacteria that bdellovibrio do prey upon, but did not include salmonella and e. coli which are known to colonise the tiber
 <cit>  and which are commonly used bdellovibrio prey in the lab.

the tiberius-only gene set will also include some ancestral genes, shared with a common deltaproteobacterial ancestor, which have been lost by genome flux from the hd <dig> genome but retained as they confer fitness to tiberius. evidence suggestive of these was seen by highest scoring blast homologues being from the deltaproteobacteria, including the myxobacteria such as myxococcus, stigmatella and others and the metal reducing deltaproteobacteria including geobacter and desulfovibrio. some of the genes in this category may encode products relevant to prey-independent growth in the polluted environment of the tiber
 <cit> . they include bdt <dig>  a polyhydroxybuturate depolymerase gene whose highest homologue is from myxococcus- this might allow degradation of recyclable plastic pollutants. in addition the gene bdt <dig> with rela/spot homology mentioned above has highest homology with a gene from geobacter and a tetr transcriptional regulator gene has highest homology with desulfuromonas, both deltaproteobacteria.

potential significance and lgt sources of genes present in hd <dig> but not in tiberius
again these genes  will fall into categories of ancestral genes lost by tiberius or genes laterally transferred into hd <dig>  genes present in hd <dig> but absent from tiberius include two associated with cyclic-digmp signalling function- a ggdef diguanylate cyclase-synthase gene bd <dig> and an hd-gyp-family gene, bd <dig>  predicted to encode c-digmp degrading or binding function; however  <dig> other ggdef genes and  <dig> other hd-gyp genes were also in the tiberius genome, allowing for c-digmp signalling; furthermore, studies on the bd <dig> ggdef gene product in hd <dig> showed that unlike the other four ggdef genes, bd <dig> does not produce a strong growth phenotype when deleted from strain hd100
 <cit> .

a large group of genes running from bd1677-bd <dig>  predicted to be associated with outer membrane and capsular polysaccharide synthesis, were present in strain hd <dig> only. these differences likely reflect different habitats of hd <dig> possibly binding to other micro or macro-organism surfaces in soil. these interactions would be are absent in the aquatic niche and so the nature of the surface capsule would be different. another category of genes present in hd <dig> but absent from tiberius appear to be associated with encoding alternative electron transport. these include some cytochrome biogenesis genes, including bd <dig>  bd <dig> and, bd2597-bd <dig>  a small putative nitric oxide reductase gene cluster. this difference is suggestive of alternative electron transport to nitrogen compounds probably relevant to the nitrogen cycles of the hd <dig> terrestrial and rhizosphere niches.

four hd <dig> genes bd1723-bd <dig> and bd <dig> associated with carotenoid synthesis are not conserved in tiberius, suggesting that free radical protection in terrestrial and aquatic environments is achieved by different pathways. this carotenoid gene content seems to correlate with the appearance of b. bacteriovorus tiberius cells which are white, compared to the yellow colour of the hd <dig> strain . the absence in tiberius of the hd <dig>  kdpa-e genes bd1755-bd <dig> may fit with different “compatible solute” adaptation strategies to changes in osmolarity between aquatic and terrestrial strains.

more typical examples of “mobile dna”, present in hd <dig> but not tiberius include phage genes and also bd3694-bd <dig> genes for a restriction-modification system. in contrast to tiberius where a diverse range of bacteria were potential sources of lgt, the most common blast top hits for products of genes present in hd <dig> but not in tiberius were other deltaproteobacteria which are terrestrial, such as myxococcus, geobacter and stigmatella, followed predominantly by other terrestrial bacteria such as hyphomicrobium and plant associated bacteria such as pseudomonas syringae and azocarus sp, rarely there were bacteria of a less certain habitat, including: flavobacterium and serratia. the hd100-only genes with deltaproteobacteria blast top hits may represent ancestral genes, or lgt from soil bacteria.

rates of synonymous, non-synonymous substitutions in orthologous gene pairs
the rsd analysis allowed us, for  <dig> orthologous pairs of genes in the two strains, to compare the rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, and omega the ratio of dn/ds . while population genetics theory predicts that genes with dn/ds >  <dig> would be under positive selection, in reality positive selection is likely to be acting only on a limited number of sites in a gene. thus some gene pairs with high dn/ds  values  are discussed in this section.

consistent with findings for other bacterial species
 <cit>  the pairwise comparison of orthologs from bdellovibrio hd <dig> and tiberius suggest that these genomes are evolving under strong purifying selection . exceptions to this include a number of genes with high omega values, which may be experiencing positive selection due to adaptive evolution or relaxed purifying selection due to differences in functional requirements arising from the different niches. gene pairs discussed below with high omega values  also have dn >  <dig>  and ds <  <dig> , , which allowed meaningful estimates of omega.

genes with high rates of non-synonymous substitutions may be: 1) ancestral genes that are subject to evolutionary pressures in one strain, because the encoded products confer a different fitness in bdellovibrio in the terrestrial niche versus the aquatic one. an example of this category is the pila gene ; the product of which  is subject to external environmental selective pressures  and so is typical of a gene that would be fast evolving in the different aquatic versus terrestrial environments of the two bdellovibrio strains. 2) genes acquired by lgt, which are subject to ongoing amelioration. the cina homologue bdt0498/bd <dig> gene pair are an example of this as the gene lies immediately upstream of reca in each genome but has different codon usage from the surrounding 5’ and 3’ regions. 3) paralogous genes where there has been a duplication event such that one paralog is able to be changed by random mutagenesis to encode a paralogous rather than orthologous function in a new niche. an example of this latter category is the bd2572/bdt <dig> tata gene pair, which encode a structural component of the folded-protein secretion- apparatus called the tat system. gene tata has a paralog tate ,
 <cit>  likely allowing more rapid sequence divergence of tata as evidenced by the high omega score.

a comparison of the hd <dig> strain hit locus gene bd <dig> to tiberius gene bdt <dig> in light of the tiberius prey-independent growth phenotype
when b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> or other strains convert to prey-independent growth in the lab, often, , a concomitant mutation in gene bd <dig> can be detected
 <cit> . such mutations often abolish expression of the bd <dig> gene product , or commonly involve the deletion of a  <dig> bp region flanked by repeat elements. the tiberius genome contains a same-length homologue of bd <dig>  gene bdt <dig>  although there are  <dig> amino-acid differences between the predicted gene products: vhd10031atiberius, a86t and the less conservative substitution g97s; none of these substitutions have been reported in other bdellovibrio to cause prey-independent growth. thus, although we do not have absolute proof; bd <dig> substitutions are not likely to be the cause of the simultaneous predatory and prey-independent growth observed in the tiberius strain. as the tiberius source dna which was used for the genome sequence contained mostly attack phase cells, with some of the longer prey-independently growing cells; it seems unlikely that mutations in the bdt <dig> gene were required for this dual growth mode. this was confirmed by isolating , hi growth phase tiberius cells. this was done by screening and selection, in the absence of prey cells, on py medium
 <cit>  and re-sequencing the bdt <dig> gene. for  <dig> separate hi isolates of tiberius, the bdt <dig> sequence was unchanged from the wild-type. this suggests that hi growth may be regulated by different mechanisms in the tiberius and hd <dig> strains. it is a possibility that these differences are associated with the above described snps in these genes, but testing this would be the subject of a further study.

conservation of encoded functions in the tiberius genome relevant to prey location in the hd <dig> strain
motility and chemotaxis have both been shown to be important in efficient prey location by b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> when analysed in a laboratory setting
 <cit> . all hd <dig> flagellar-related genes are conserved in the tiberius genome, including the multiple copies of genes encoding the structural flagellin flic , the motor proteins mota and motb  and the rotor protein flig . the two key flagellin genes for motility, bd <dig> encoding flic <dig>  and bd <dig> encoding flic <dig>  are predicted to encode products 100% identical at the amino-acid level in hd <dig> and tiberius.

the chemotaxis system “directs” flagellar motility to prey-rich regions, and all tactic signalling proteins, including the multiple copies of key phospho-relay signalling components  are conserved. the number and diversity of the mcp tactic sensor genes differs between the two strains.  <dig> mcp genes and the single aerotaxis gene are conserved in both strains. a pair of mcp genes from hd <dig>  are fused into a single gene in tiberius . the hd <dig> genome contains an additional  <dig> mcp genes  that are not found in tiberius, whilst the tiberius genome also contains a further  <dig> mcp genes not found in hd <dig> . the different aquatic and terrestrial environments from which the two bdellovibrio strains have been isolated may have required chemotactic responses to different input stimuli, resulting in alterations to genes encoding the mcp-stimulus sensor complement of chemotactic sensory array components.

type iv pili have been shown to be essential for predation by b. bacteriovorous hd100
 <cit>  and in strains 109j and b. exovorus jss
 <cit> . all genes predicted to be involved in the synthesis of type iv pili in hd <dig>  were conserved in the tiberius genome. both b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> and tiberius have an incomplete  set of flp-pilus-associated genes, yet neither have a significantly convincing homologue for the structural flp fibre subunit. the hd <dig> genome contains none of the genes required for fimbrial production, whilst the tiberius genome contains inserted genes coding for the chaperone bdt <dig> papd and bdt <dig> – papc; but again no homologue to encode the structural fibre subunit fima. it may be that novel fimbrial fibre subunit proteins are encoded in these genomes but bear no resemblance to those previously studied in other bacteria. four operons encoding tol-pal-tonb-like proteins for gliding motility are conserved in both tiberius and hd <dig> strains and the tiberius strain was observed to glide on agarose surfaces as does hd <dig> .

conservation of genes in tiberius whose transcription in hd <dig> is associated with predatory or prey-independent bdellovibrio lifestyles
previously we profiled by microarrays the proportion of the hd <dig> genome that was expressed in conditions of early predatory invasion of prey, versus prey-independent growth or non-replicative life in buffer seeking prey 
 <cit> . this revealed, for strain hd <dig>  subsets of genes predicted to be associated with each lifestyle. comparing the extent of genome conservation for tiberius with each hd <dig> transcriptome shows that of the 256– <dig> manual blast-rsd predicted  genes not conserved between tiberius and hd100:

154– <dig>  of the non-conserved genes were found to be associated with “attack phase” life in hd <dig> . it is not surprising given the different terrestrial versus polluted aquatic environments from which the two strains were isolated, that the major gene differences lie in genes expressed in hd <dig> while it was in predatory mode, hunting prey as viability to encounter prey would be enhanced by repelling negative influences in the terrestrial environment. it must be remembered though that for hd <dig> the majority of the population cannot grow and divide in such a state, without prey entry, unlike the tiberius strain. of these 154– <dig> genes, 21– <dig> are predicted  to localize to the inner membrane and  <dig>  are predicted to localize to the outer membrane supporting the idea that at least some have functions associated with the differing external environments encountered by the two strains.

only 16– <dig>  of the non-conserved genes were found to be transcriptionally profiled in hd <dig> as “predatory invasion associated” . this means that  <dig> by blast- <dig> by rsd, of the  <dig> predatorily associated genes found in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> “predatosome”
 <cit>  are conserved between the two different bdellovibrio strains and likely encode products vital to predatory processes.

31– <dig>  of the non-conserved genes were found to be “hi or growth associated” . this shows that 1063– <dig> genes  of  <dig> identified in hd <dig> transcriptomics as hi growth associated  are conserved between the two strains.

the remaining 55– <dig>  of the  <dig> hd <dig> genes, not conserved in tiberius, were not differentially regulated in the hd <dig> transcriptomic studies to date and may be associated with stages of the lifecycle not transcriptionally profiled in our previous study .

thus the genomic comparison of tiberius and hd <dig> genomic content does show conservation of predatorily associated genes as would be expected by their conserved prey invasive life styles, albeit in environments where the prey and the physico-chemical environments differ.

CONCLUSIONS
the novel b. bacteriovorus tiberius strain grew simultaneously predatorily and prey-independently which may be related to the highly polluted niche containing, in addition to river and esturine bacteria, industrial effluents, organic carbon and bacteria from human sewage
 <cit> .

the genome of aquatic b. bacteriovorus tiberius showed significant conservation with that of terrestrial b. bacteriovorus hd <dig>  especially in the case of  <dig> genes profiled by transcriptional studies in strain hd <dig>  to be specifically associated with early events during prey invasion. as there have not been extensive genomic sequencing studies of the predatory bdellovibrios, this conserved subset of  <dig>   <dig>  “predatosome” genes illustrate which is required for predatory invasion and may be worthy of further mutagenesis and study. only one of these genes, bd <dig>  predicted to encode an actin-binding protein, is also predicted by gophna and doolittle to have been acquired by ancient lateral gene transfer
 <cit> . it is possible that this gene could encode binding of bdellovibrio to prey mreb  cytoskeletons for predatory invasion. however this speculation requires experimental verification. it is likely that amelioration & co-evolution of the bdellovibrio genome has masked the identity of some anciently acquired predatory genes.

the diverse bacterial microbiota of the tiber afforded the b. bacteriovorus tiberius strain many chances for predation, but also for lgt from bacteria that it may not have preyed upon. the differences and similarities in gene content between the two bdellovibrio strains, map well onto the conclusions of pan et al. and gophna and doolittle who made in silico predictions of, respectively, modern and ancient lgt into the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome. only 8% of genes predicted to have a modern lgt source in b. bacteriovorus hd100
 <cit>  were conserved in b. bacteriovorus tiberius, but far more, 92%, were conserved in both strains from the group predicted to be as a result of ancient lgt into strain hd100
 <cit> .

when considering possible lgt in each strain it was found that genes present in strain hd <dig>  but not tiberius, commonly encoded products with blast top-hits from terrestrial or plant-associated bacteria. in contrast those genes found in tiberius but not hd <dig>  commonly had blast top-hits from aquatic and marine bacterial sources, but not from e. coli and salmonella, which are experimentally documented by bonadonna and co-workers
 <cit>  to be in the river tiber, as sewage pollutants, in ranges from  <dig> -  <dig> ml- <dig>  this is an interesting finding as although e. coli and salmonella are readily preyed upon by b. bacteriovorus tiberius, the predation efficiency or even capability on the marine and aquatic bacteria has not been determined, but should be in future environmental microbiology studies. any differences in predation efficiency could suggest that lgt occurs into bdellovibrio from bacteria which are sub-optimal prey. bdellovibrio invade other bacteria using their non-flagellar “nose” pole only. non-predatory contacts by other bacteria at points elsewhere on the bdellovibrio cell, do allow conjugation to occur  and thus this could be a source of lgt via plasmids in the wild. the fact that a percentage of b. bacteriovorus tiberius populations spend their lives in prey-independent, rather than predatory growth, unlike the dominantly predatory hd <dig> strain, might contribute to a greater propensity for lgt into the tiberius strain . however the diverse dissolved solutes of the tiber also may place a selective pressure on the b. bacteriovorus tiberius strain to retain more genes encoding efflux pumps and detoxifying enzymes that hd <dig> 

this study shows that there is a balance between predatory and prey-independent growth in some bdellovibrio such as strain tiberius, from natural environments. self recognition of bdellovibrio does occur across strains and the hd <dig> and tiberius strains did not prey upon each other.

despite their predatory nature, and efficient degradation of prey bacterial nucleic acids, aquatic and terrestrial b. bacteriovorus do acquire dna from bacteria in the wild. in this study lgt into b. bacteriovorus tiberius came more from natural microbiota of the aquatic-marine niche of the river tiber than from sewage pollutant bacteria.
