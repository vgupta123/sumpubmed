BACKGROUND
a fundamental characteristic of all cancers is cell cycle deregulation  <cit> . although diverse factors such as point mutation, gene amplification, activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressors, and hypermethylation are involved in cancer development, their influence ultimately is on the cell cycle machinery. therefore, various methods of cell cycle phase estimation have been developed. the m phase indicator mitotic index, the number of mitotic bodies in a microscopic field, and the s-phase fraction, a dna flow cytometry determination, are used to measure the tumor proliferation rate and are predictive for breast cancer prognosis  <cit> . immunohistochemistry  against cell cycle markers is another tool. for example, the expression of g1-s transition marker cyclin e, s-g <dig> marker cyclin a, or s-g2-m marker geminin are predictive of poor prognosis of breast cancers  <cit> . however, these methods rely on one or few measurements and consequently provide a limited scope of information. there is a need for more systematic methods of cell cycle phase analysis, such as microarray-based techniques  <cit> .

gene expression signatures, which are capable of predicting the state of a sample from a given microarray dataset, are the emerging technology for developing cancer therapeutics. the "70-gene signature" from a breast cancer dataset has shown predictive power for the risk of recurrence  <cit> . the "pathway deregulation signature" has shown the ability to predict pathway status and to characterize breast, lung and ovarian cancers  <cit> . the "chemotherapy response signature" has accurately predicted clinical response to cytotoxic drugs for breast and ovarian cancers  <cit> . here, we report the development of the "cell cycle signature " which indexes the cell cycle phase distribution from microarray profiles considering both cycling and non-cycling cells. the ccs method depicted "buried" cell cycle phase distributions that were oncogenic-event specific in a mouse tumor model dataset and were associated with patients' prognosis in human breast cancer datasets. the method has a potential to be of value in the characterization and diagnosis of cancers.

RESULTS
algorithm
to analyze cell cycle phase distribution, a series of ccss were created as described in methods . the ccs masterset,  <dig> genes that express preferentially in cycling cells and in a cell cycle-regulated manner, represents the entire cell cycle and is henceforth denoted as ccscycling. eighteen ccs subsets, each composed of genes whose expressions peak at a specific stage of the cell cycle, represent the phases of the cell cycle and are denoted using the subscript naming convention of ccsphase. for example, the ccs subsets for the g <dig> phase are expressed as ccsg <dig>  for the g2-m phase as ccsg2-m, and so on.

solid tumors are composed of various proportions of cycling and non-cycling cells  <cit> , and cell cycle phase distributions can be assessed as per total cells or as per cycling cells. since microarray measurements are the net expression of all cells in the sample, the data is generally per total cells. to obtain data per cycling cells from a given microarray dataset , a subdataset is created by extracting the expression values of ccscycling genes . then, both the total and the cycling gene datasets undergo quantile normalization which gives the same expression value distribution for each sample  <cit> . in the total gene dataset, normalization is done on all genes. on the other hand, in the cycling gene dataset, normalization is done only on the cycling genes. because genes in the ccscycling preferentially express in cycling cells, the influence of non-cycling cells would be limited for the cycling gene dataset. scores for each ccs are calculated for both datasets. ccscycling and ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset could index the proportion of cycling cells and of cells at the designated cell cycle phase per total cells, respectively. similarly, ccsphase scores for the cycling gene dataset could index the proportion of cells at the cell cycle phase per cycling cells. ccscycling scores for the cycling gene dataset could index the proportion of cycling cells per cycling cells and thus would show constant values.

validation
in the preliminary analysis of the whitfiled et al. cell cycle dataset  <cit> , ccs indexed cell cycle phase distribution as expected . to confirm that the ccs method is valid for independent datasets, a cell cycle dataset of synchronized hct <dig> cells was prepared and analyzed. as shown in fig. 2a, similar heat map patterns were observed for the total and the cycling gene datasets. differences in the ccscycling scores for both the total and the cycling gene datasets were slight in the situation where most cells were expected to be in the cell cycle. peaks in the ccsphase scores shifted according to cell cycle progression , and peaks ceased around the m phase in cells treated with the mitosis inhibitor nocodazole , consistent with dna flow cytometry measurements . the ccs method was able to index cell cycle phase distribution even for an independent cell cycle dataset derived from a different cell line and a different platform.

solid tumors are not solely composed of cycling cells but contain various numbers of non-cycling cells  <cit> . theoretically, changes in the proportion of cycling cells in the sample are expected to evenly change the proportion of cells in all cell cycle phases. to examine the influence of changes in the proportion of cycling cells on ccs scores, analysis was conducted on the fournier et al. dataset  <cit>  of profiles of human mammary epithelial cells  cultured in leucine-rich extra cellular matrix. in this system, hmecs grow exponentially and then enter a quiescent state  <cit> . as shown in fig. 2c, ccscycling and ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset uniformly decreased as the hmecs transitioned from cycling  to non-cycling state  . according to the dna flow cytometry estimation in the original report, the s phase and g2+m phase fraction size decreased from 15% ±  <dig>   to  <dig> % ±  <dig>  , and from 12% ±  <dig>   to 7% ±  <dig>  , respectively   <cit> . on the other hand, the g0+g <dig> phase fraction size increased from 73% ±  <dig>   to 86% ±  <dig>  . due to the inability of dna flow cytometry to distinguish cells in g <dig> from cells in g <dig>  decisive conclusions cannot be made. however, from two situations in which 1) 3d cultured hmecs gradually underwent growth arrest and 2) ccsg <dig> scores decreased at day  <dig>  this increase can be regarded as an increase in the number of cells at the g <dig> phase as well as a decrease in the number of cells at the g <dig> phase. to our surprise, the heat map for the cycling gene dataset showed increasing ccsg <dig> scores towards day  <dig> . this increase in ccsg <dig> scores could be due to the g <dig> phase prolongation which is known to occur under g0-inducing conditions, such as serum starvation and development  <cit> . for further confirmation, we analyzed the cam et al. dataset  <cit>  of profiles of growing and serum starved t <dig> breast cancer cells. similar to the results for hmecs, a uniform decrease in ccscycling and ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset was observed in serum-starved cells . in addition, an increase in ccsg <dig> scores for the cycling gene dataset was observed , indicating prolongation of the g <dig> phase. taken together, these results suggested that changes in the proportion of cycling cells in the sample can be presented as uniform changes in ccscycling and ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset.

the mammalian cell cycle is a highly regulated and conserved process  <cit> . to investigate whether ccs derived from human datasets can be used to closely related species, the yamamoto et al. dataset  <cit> , cell cycle profiles  of nih3t <dig> mouse fibroblasts, was analyzed. the heat map showed changes in the proportion of cycling cells  as well as cell cycle progression from g <dig> to s phase , as quiescent cells  re-enter the cell cycle, progress through g <dig> phase and enter s phase . these results showed that the human ccs created in this study can be applied for the analysis of mouse datasets.

analysis on mouse tumor model dataset
the ccs method was applied to the herschkowitz et al. dataset  <cit>  which contains  <dig> profiles of  <dig> different mouse mammary carcinoma models and normal samples. the authors reported that some models developed similar tumors  of gene expression and histological phenotype while other models showed heterogeneity  and gave "randomness of the molecular basis of tumor initiation" as the reason for the heterogeneity. as shown in fig. 3a, ccscycling and ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset for the normal samples were consistently very low, while scores for tumors were varying degrees higher, indicating variation in the proportion of cycling cells. it is reasonable that heterogeneous models show variation in ccscycling and ccsphase scores. however, variation was also seen in each homogeneous model, although tag models had a tendency towards higher scores and the neu model had a tendency towards lower scores. in contrast, ccsphase scores for the cycling gene dataset were similar within the same homogeneous models, except in the myc model . to illustrate this in detail, ccsphase scores of several models for both datasets were plotted as shown in fig. 3b. it can be seen that each model has a specific cell cycle phase distribution. high ccsg <dig> and low ccss-g2-m scores were seen in the neu model. the opposite pattern was seen in one of the tag models. the myc model showed two different cell cycle phase distributions  and the reason is not clear. however, because myc has been reported to induce genomic instability and to contribute to tumorigenesis through a dominant mutator effect  <cit> , additional oncogenic events may have been induced. in all cases, plots for the total gene dataset were vertically shifted in varying degrees which would be due to the influence of non-cycling cells, as presented in hmecs and t <dig> cells. on the other hand, plots for the cycling gene dataset showed minimal variation in alignment. these results indicated two findings:  the cell cycle phase distribution reflects the oncogenic events in tumors, and  the cell cycle phase distribution can be better indexed when the influence of non-cycling cells is taken into account. the advantage of the ccs method can be underscored considering that the current cell cycle phase estimation methods relying on one or few measurements are not sufficient to depict cell cycle phase distribution or to distinguish non-cycling cells.

analysis on human breast cancer datasets
the ccs method was applied to the ivshina et al. dataset  <cit>  from a panel of  <dig> human breast cancers. the heat map for the total gene dataset showed various ccscycling scores, indicative of variations in the proportion of cycling cells in the sample . the ccsphase scores were not uniformly changed in some patients, suggesting that cell cycle phase distributions were also altered. the heat map for the cycling gene dataset displayed a rolling wave pattern . patients with high ccscycling scores for the total gene dataset had high ccss-g2-m and low ccsg <dig> scores for the cycling gene dataset, but several exceptions existed , reminding the influence of non-cycling cells found in the analysis of mouse tumor models. clinical annotations were available for this dataset and so the relevance between ccs scores and patient prognosis were tested. patients were dichotomized by the median of each ccs score and then the risk differences between the two groups for disease free survival  were assessed using log-rank test and cox univariate analysis . the ccscycling score for the total gene dataset was significantly predictive of poor prognosis  , consistent with the common view that a larger number of cycling cells correlates with worse clinical outcome. the ccss-g2-m and several ccsg <dig> scores for the total gene dataset were also predictive of poor prognosis. on the other hand, ccsg <dig> scores for the cycling gene dataset had an adverse prognostic power and gave the highest prognostic value among the tests  .

to exclude the possibility of dataset specificity, the ccs method was also applied to the langerød et al. dataset  <cit>  from a panel of  <dig> breast cancers. similar results were obtained . for the total gene dataset, variations in ccscycling scores and non-uniform changes in ccsphase scores in some patients were observed. patients with high ccscycling scores for the total gene dataset had high ccss-g2-m and low ccsg <dig> scores for the cycling gene dataset with some exceptions. ccsg <dig> scores for the cycling gene dataset were predictive for dfs as with the ivshina et al. dataset and gave the highest prognostic value  . taken together, these results indicated that:  variations in the proportion of cycling cells exist among tumors,  the proportion of cycling cells correlated to the cell cycle phase distribution per cycling cells with several exceptions, and  the cell cycle phase distribution per cycling cells better associated with patients' prognosis.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we developed a signature-based method to index cell cycle phase distribution from microarray profiles under consideration of cycling and non-cycling cells, providing two sources of valuable information on cancers.

one source of information is the proportion of cycling cells in the sample. the rationale of most current cell cycle phase estimation methods, including mitotic index, s phase fraction and ihc against cell cycle markers, is that the high proliferative tumors leading to poor prognosis contain more cycling cells. in the analysis of the human breast cancer datasets, higher ccscycling scores for the total gene dataset, indicative of a larger number of cycling cells in the sample, did associate with poor prognosis. naturally, it can be thought that an increase in the number of cycling cells leads to a uniform increase in the number of cells at all cell cycle phases. however, some patients showed non-uniform changes in ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset , suggesting that each cell cycle phase was not evenly changed. similarly, whitfield et al. observed that some cell cycle-regulated genes did not express in correlation with proliferation status in some breast cancers  <cit> . furthermore, although the g <dig> phase is a part of the cell cycle, g <dig> phase marker cyclin d <dig> often negatively correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancers  <cit> . therefore, considering only the proportion of cycling cells seems insufficient.

the other source of information is cell cycle phase distribution. a number of oncogenic events are known to perturb the duration of cell cycle phases. for example, activation of oncogenes such as v-h-ras, v-src, v-raf, cyclin d <dig>  cyclin e, and c-myc shortens the g <dig> phase  <cit> . loss of tumor suppressor pten shortens the g <dig> phase  <cit>  and loss of lzts <dig> and lats <dig> shortens the m phase  <cit> . viral infections such as sv40-tag and htlv- <dig> tax also shorten the g <dig> phase  <cit> . such perturbations in the cell cycle phase duration subsequently alter the cell cycle phase distribution. thus, the cell cycle phase distribution per cycling cells would reflect the biology of cancers. actually, in the analysis of mouse tumor models, oncogenic-event specific cell cycle phase distributions were observed. this suggests that the cell cycle phase distribution under consideration of both cycling and non-cycling cells has a potential for cancer characterization.

a model of tumors with different cell cycle phase distributions is proposed in fig.  <dig>  oncogenic events perturb the cell cycle each in a unique way which in turn alters the cell cycle phase distribution as well as the proliferation rate. high proliferative tumors grow rapidly and thereby produce a large number of cycling cells. the opposite is the true for low proliferative tumors. however, high proliferative tumors with a small number of cycling cells or low proliferative tumors with a large number of cycling cells would exist at a low probability. this model would account for non-uniform changes in ccsphase scores for the total gene dataset found in some breast cancer patients, the whitfield et al.'s observation, and the adverse prognostic value of cyclin d <dig>  current cell cycle phase estimation methods are insufficient for detecting such cancers. mitotic index and s-phase fraction do not recognize non-cycling cells. combinatorial ihc  <cit>  still needs improvement and validation. shetty et al. reported a relationship between breast cancer grade and g <dig> phase length estimated from the ratio of geminin and ki <dig> ihc measurements; however, it was not significant  <cit> . the ccs method, on the other hand, indexed the cell cycle phase distribution under consideration of cycling and non-cycling cells, and showed a potential for characterizing cancers.

previously, as an alternative microarray-based cell cycle analysis technique, lu et al. introduced the "expression deconvolution" method  <cit> . to predict the cell cycle phase distribution of yeast, they prepared about  <dig> equations with  <dig> variables representing  <dig> cell cycle phases and searched for the optimal solution. the method has comparable or even better potential to improve cancer characterization than the ccs method. however, it requires a tremendous amount of computational resources to find the optimal solution and avoid the local minimum, especially as the number of variables increases . there are some hurdles that need to be overcome before high resolution cell cycle phase analysis is practical and we are currently tackling some of them.
