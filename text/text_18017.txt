BACKGROUND
prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the world and the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in men  <cit> . early prostate cancer  can undergo radical surgery or radiation therapy, the curative effect is good. for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer , endocrine therapy is the preferred method. unfortunately, after 1– <dig> years, the tumors ultimately progress and become castration resistant prostate cancer . this is the end stage of prostate cancer and is the bottleneck of treatment. the mechanism of crpc advance, why the tumor is not sensitive to chemotherapy, was not completely clear.

more and more evidence indicate that the cancer stem cells  exist objectively and play an important role in the tumorigenesis and progression of the tumors  <cit> . this part takes up only a small percentage of all cancer cells, but is closely related to tumor recurrence and metastasis. many research has shown that cancer drug resistance to chemotherapy is associated with csc, which have the potential for self-renewal, differentiation, strong migration and invasion ability  <cit> . cell signaling pathways related to maintain stem cell self-renewal and proliferation include pi3k/akt, wnt, stat3/ <dig>  egf/egfr and so on  <cit> . preliminary works from our research group showed that after endocrine therapy, the prostate cancer stem/progenitor  cells increased in tumor tissue of the patients, which further confirmed the role of s/p cells in prostate cancer progression  <cit> .

the epithelial- mesenchymal transition  is the process that in a particular physiological and pathological conditions, the epithelial cells transfer to mesenchymal cells, involving in multiple genes and multi-step, the intercellular adhesion weakening and cell movement strengthening. emt provides such a basis for epithelial tumor cells. lue’s research  <cit>  had shown that a zinc transporter liv <dig> could promote emt and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. this procedure is mediated through erk signaling pathway. other studies have found that bmp <dig> and sirt <dig> could induce emt in prostate cancer pc- <dig> cells, and pi3k and erk signaling pathway was involved in this process. this promoted invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer  <cit> . in addition, the emt markers can be detected in prostate cancer patients, with primary tumors and bone metastases. immunohistochemical study showed that the expression of emt markers was higher in the edge location cells of primary tumors and metastatic lesion than that of the cells in the center of the tumor. notch <dig> expression in bone metastases is significantly higher than that in primary tumorsand, and may play an important role in the bone metastasis of prostate cancer  <cit> . these data suggest that emt plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer. consistent with this, our preliminary data showed the cancer cells with emt phenotype increased after endocrine therapy in human pca tissue  <cit> .

it was shown that emt phenotype tumor cells had certain features of stem cells, and some stem-like cells had emt features, and these two types of cells were associated with tumor drug resistance  <cit> . androgen receptor , a member of the nuclear receptor super family, can be activated by its ligands, androgens, to regulate its target gene expression. androgen/androgen receptor  signaling plays pivotal roles in the prostate development and homeostasis as well as in the progression of prostate cancer   <cit> . whether prostate cancer stem cells have the features of emt and roles of ar in this process was unclear, in this study, we would investigate emt characteristics in prostate cancer s/p cells, and the roles of ar in regulating emt and characteristics of s/p cells.

RESULTS

ar was a suppressor in emt of s/p cells from lncap cell line
s/p cells were infected with lentivirus carrying either vector or ar and grown in two different androgen concentrations, charcoal stripped -fbs +  <dig> nm dht, and cs-fbs +  <dig> nm dht. western blot assay was used to test ar, e cadherin, n cadherin, vimentin and snail expression using cell extracts of vector s/p and ar s/p cells. as shown in figure 3a, the expression of emt markers decreased, when ar was overexpressed in s/p cells. then how ar affected s/p cells proliferation, was investigated. cells were incubated in  <dig> well dishes . at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 days, mtt assays were performed. the ars/p cells proliferation was inhibited during different dht concentration, compared to that of vector s/p cells. but ar played an opposite role in non s/p cells . soft agar colony formation assay was used to test tumorigenicity. after incubated for 21 days, colonies larger than 1 mm in diameter were counted. the ars/p cells tumorigenicity was inhibited under different dht concentration, compared to that of vector s/p cells . similarly, the self-renewal ability was inhibited, when ar was overexpressed in s/p cells . moreover, the migrative potential of ars/p cells was inhibited in different dht concentration, compared to that of vector s/p cells. meanwhile, ar played an opposite role in non s/p cells .figure  <dig> ar is a suppressor in emt of s/p cells from lncap cell line. s/p cells were infected with lentivirus carrying either vector or ar and grown in two different androgen concentrations, charcoal stripped -fbs +  <dig> nm dht, cs-fbs +  <dig> nm dht.  western blot analysis of ar, e cadherin, n cadherin, vimentin and snail using cell extracts of vector s/p and ar s/p cells.  mtt assay. cells were incubated in  <dig> well dishes . at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 6 days, mtt assays were performed.  soft agar colony formation assay. the plates were incubated at 37°c in a humidified incubator for 21 days. colonies larger than 1 mm in diameter were counted.  sphere formation assay. cells  were mixed with matrigel  and placed in rim of well of 24well culture plates. after solidified, 1 ml of medium was added and grown for 21 days. pictures were taken under microscope.  migration assay. the migrative potential of different cells was assessed using the 8 μm pore transwell system. cells  were resuspended in 100 μl serum free medium and added in the upper compartment. 600 μl of 20% cs-fbs medium was placed in the lower compartment. after 24 hours, cells that had not migrated were removed from the upper face of the membranes with cotton swabs. the average number of cells per field of view  was counted at ×  <dig> magnification. all experiments samples were plated in triplicate.



the signaling pathways activation related to self-renewal/proliferation in lncap s/p cells
it was known that pi3k/akt, bcl- <dig>  c-myc, mapk , tgf-ß, and stat <dig> cell signaling pathways might involve in s/p cells proliferation and apoptosis. the probably related signaling pathways in parental, s/p, and non s/p cells of lncap cell line were examined using western blot analysis. it was found that p-akt, bcl- <dig> and c-myc were expressed higher in s/p cells, compared to those of non s/p cells . when lncap s/p cells were infected with lentivirus carrying ar, the expression of p-akt, bcl- <dig>  and c-myc were inhibited . then to confirm the signaling pathways related to s/p cells proliferation, the s/p cells of lncap cell line were transfected with ar, oligo bcl- <dig> sirna, or/and c-myc sirna plasmids indicated. at the end of 4 days of culture after transfection, cells were used to do mtt assay. it was found ar, sibcl- <dig>  or/and sic-myc all could inhibit s/p cells proliferation. combining use of si bcl- <dig> with si c-myc could show stronger inhibition .figure  <dig> activation of self-renewal/proliferation related signaling pathways in lncap s/p cells.  the probably related signaling pathways in parental, s/p, and non s/p cells of lncap cell line were examined by western blot analysis, such as akt, bcl- <dig>  c-myc, mapk  and stat <dig>   cells  were infected with lentivirus carrying v/ar and the levels of ar, p-akt, bcl- <dig>  and c-myc were examined by western blot analysis.  the s/p cells of lncap cell line were transfected with ar, oligo bcl- <dig> sirna, or/and c-myc sirna plasmids indicated. at the end of 4 days of culture after transfection, cells were used to do mtt assay.

discussion
it’s believed that cancer stem/progenitor cells and emt played very important roles in prostate cancer development  <cit> . emt is closely related to pca drug resistance. emt and stem-like cell markers expression of the docetaxel-resistant pca cells had increased. zeb <dig> sirna transfection reverted docetaxel resistance and reduced cd <dig> expression in du-145r and pc-3r  <cit> . it was shown that pcaradio resistance is associated with emt and enhanced csc phenotypes via activation of the pi3k/akt/mtor signaling pathway  <cit> . after androgen-deprivation therapy , the s/p cells increases, which have low ar expression. it was reported that adt could lead to emt in both normal prostate and prostate cancer tissues  <cit> . sethi  <cit>  found that the cancer cells emt marker expression was different at the edge of human primary tumors and bone metastasis of prostate cancer. the expression of emt marker vimentin, nuclear factor-кb , notch- <dig> and zeb <dig> increased. meanwhile, epithelial markers e cadherin expression level was low. this study suggested emt was closely related to invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer. another study showed that emt phenotype could be detected in arcapm and pdgf-d overexpression pc-3prostate cancer cell lines. compared with the arcape and pc- <dig> cells, the tumor formation and self-renewal capacity of these cells significantly increased. stem cell markers sox <dig>  nanog, oct <dig>  lin28b and/or notch <dig> expression significantly increased and the cells had some characteristics of stem cells. mir <dig> could inhibit notch <dig> expression, and cells tumor formation capacity and self-renewing ability decreased. through notch <dig> signaling pathway, mir <dig> regulated characteristics of stem cells of emt phenotype prostate cancer cell  <cit> . all these results indicated that emt has some relationship with csc.

our preliminary data show that both tumor cells with emt markers and tumor cells with csc markers increase after adt in tumor tissue of prostate cancer patients  <cit> . stem-like sp cells acquired more complete emt molecular features and exhibited stronger aggressive capability  <cit> . in this research, our group made it clear that csc of prostate cancer had some emt characteristics. compared with those of non s/p cells, the emt markers expression of s/p cells increased, tumorigenesis ability and migration and invasion capacity wre enhanced in s/p cells. these two kinds of cells increased, after adt and these may common led to the failure of traditional endocrine treatment and disease progress.

androgen/androgen receptor  axis cancer  <cit> . now it was considered that prostate cancer cells varied, and are mainly luminal cells, but there are also some basal cells and intermediate cells. some basal cells with csc markers may be the origin of the tumor. recent studies have shown that ar expression level was different in prostate cancer cells, played a different role  <cit> . the current research and our work showed that ar expression was low in prostate cancer s/p cells. transferring arintos/p cells could inhibit their proliferation. ar’s roles in emt characteristics of s/p cells and related regulatory mechanism were not clear. in this study we transfered ar into s/p cells with lentivirus. compared with that of vector s/p cells, using different methods of immune detection, it was found that the expression of emt markers decreased, and epithelial markers e cadherin expression increased. cell proliferation, self-renewal ability, tumorigenesis and the ability to migrate were all restrained in ar-s/p cells. the characteristics of emt were restrained too. these data suggest that ar played a dual inhibition effect on s/p cell proliferation and emt features.

signaling pathways regulating prostate cancer cell emt included akt, wnt, stat <dig>  bcl- <dig>  c-myc, tgf-ß, egf/egfr, notch, mapk and so on  <cit> . it was shown that emt and csc characteristics could be regulated simultaneously. erismodegib  could inhibit emt and human prostate cancer stem cell growth in nod/scid il2rγ null mice by regulating bmi- <dig> and microrna- <dig> <cit> . in this study we tested a large number of cell signaling pathways. p-akt, bcl- <dig> and c-myc expression were higher in s/p cells than those in non s/p cell. when ar was transferred into s/p cells, these three proteins expression were significantly suppressed. then we designed sibcl- <dig> and si c-myc and they could well restrain s/p cell proliferation. so it was suggested that p-akt, bcl- <dig> and c-myc were involved in this procedure.

ar and the three signaling pathways can regulate s/p cells proliferation. so to intervene of these pathways, ly  <dig>  an inhibitor of akt signaling, γ-tt, and 5-aza, a de-methylating agent, were used. it was showed that γ-tt suppressed s/p cells through the interruption of targeting molecules including bcl- <dig>  <cit> . in addition, γ-tt has also been reported to inhibit pi3k/akt signaling  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that γ-tt might be able to suppress s/p cells via inhibiting both pi3k/akt signaling and bcl- <dig> expression. the other strategy to suppress s/p cells is to target ar directly via reversing the low expression of ar in s/p cells. it was reported that the cpg islands in the promoter and exon  <dig> of ar gene in s/p cells were highly methylated, compared to that of the non s/p cells  <cit> , and treatment of s/p cells with the de-methylating agent, 5-aza, led to significant suppression of s/p cells proliferation via inducing ar expression. combining two or three of the reagents could inhibit s/p cells tumorigenicity and growth efficiently. so, it was suggested that targeting ar or related cell signaling pathways could inhibit prostate cancer s/p cells proliferation, which could be a new strategy to treat castration resistant prostate cancer .

CONCLUSIONS
our data showed that ar played a negative role in emt of pca s/p cells, by regulating akt cell signaling pathway, which could be a new strategy to treat castration resistant prostate cancer .
