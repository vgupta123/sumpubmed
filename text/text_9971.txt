BACKGROUND
photoperiod sensitivity is an important trait that enables crops to adapt to diverse latitudinal environments. in particular, absence of or low sensitivity to photoperiod is necessary for short-day  crops, such as rice and soybean, to adapt to high latitudes. in soybean  merr.), nine major genes, e <dig> through e <dig> and j, have so far been reported to control time to flowering and maturity . photoperiod insensitivity is controlled by at least two genetic systems, in which dysfunctional alleles at three maturity loci—e <dig>  e <dig>  and e4—are involved. one control system is ascribed to the double-recessive genotype for e <dig> and e <dig> <cit> , which encode the phytochrome a  proteins gmphya <dig> and gmphya <dig>  respectively  <cit> . together with gmphya <dig>  which is encoded by a homoeologous copy of e <dig>  these two phya proteins redundantly or complementarily function in floral induction and de-etiolation responses under various light conditions  <cit> . e <dig> and e <dig> direct different flowering responses to long-day  conditions with different red-to-far–red  quantum ratios  <cit> . e <dig> controls the response to light with a high or low r:fr ratio; plants homozygous for the recessive e <dig> allele can initiate flowering under the ld conditions generated by fluorescent lamps with a high r:fr ratio  <cit> . e <dig> is involved in the response to light with a low r:fr ratio; plants homozygous for the e <dig> allele need a recessive e <dig> allele to flower under ld generated by incandescent lamps with a low r:fr ratio  <cit> . the e <dig> allele itself cannot confer the insensitivity to ld conditions induced by both fluorescent and incandescent lamps under the e <dig> genetic background  <cit> . the phya protein is not only an effective fr sensor but also acts as an r-light photoreceptor under r light with high-photon irradiance  <cit> , which is involved, either directly or via interactions with other photoreceptors, in various developmental processes . the e <dig> and e <dig> genes therefore may participate in a non-additive manner in different aspects of phya functions, which are controlled by a single phya gene in arabidopsis. another phya gene in soybean, gmphya <dig>  has been suggested to function redundantly with e <dig> in the de-etiolation response of hypocotyls and floral induction under fr light  <cit> . owing to the lack of genetic variants causing phenotypic differences, the function of gmphya <dig> has not yet been determined.

among the major genes and qtls that have been reported so far, the e <dig> gene has the most prominent effect on flowering time in soybean . cober et al.  <cit>  used an early-maturing cultivar harosoy and its near-isogenic lines  for e <dig>  e <dig> and e <dig> loci to reveal their photoperiod responses to lds with different r:fr ratios. they found that a nil with e1/e3/e <dig> was insensitive to r-enriched ld conditions but still retained sensitivity to fr-enriched ld conditions with the low r:fr ratio of  <dig> , although the nil with e1-as /e3/e <dig> lost the sensitivity across the wide range of r:fr ratios  <cit> . this result indicates that e <dig> has a marked inhibitory effect on flowering, particularly under ld conditions with the low r:fr ratio.

positional cloning revealed that e <dig> encodes a protein that contains a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal and a region related to the b <dig> domain, a highly conserved domain found in transcription factors in plants  <cit> . the abundance of e <dig> transcripts is under the photoperiodic control regulated by the e <dig> and e <dig> genes and is negatively correlated with that of two soybean orthologs of arabidopsis flowering locus t, gmft2a and gmft5a <cit> . e <dig> expression was suppressed under sd conditions regardless of genotype and induced under ld conditions in plants containing either e <dig> or e <dig> but not in those with the double-recessive e3e3e4e <dig> genotype  <cit> . furthermore, e <dig> over-expression in transgenic t <dig> soybean plants suppressed the expression of two gmft genes, thereby markedly delaying flowering, suggesting that e <dig> is a direct repressor of gmfts  <cit> . taken together, the weakened function of phya caused by the double-recessive genotype at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci may ablate or weaken sensitivity to photoperiod, at least partly, through the down-regulation of e <dig> 

the other system controlling photoperiod insensitivity in soybean acts through involvement of dysfunctional alleles at the e <dig> locus itself. photoperiod insensitivity in the japanese landrace ‘sakamotowase’ has been suggested to be controlled by a different genetic mechanism from phya dysfunction, because this landrace has a dominant functional allele at the e <dig> locus  <cit> . quantitative trait locus  mapping using testcrosses with a photoperiod-sensitive harosoy nil whose genotype was e1-as/e3/e <dig> indicated that the photoperiod insensitivity in sakamotowase was controlled mainly by an allele at or a gene tightly linked to the e <dig> locus, although a minor qtl was detected in linkage group l   <cit> . analysis of the e <dig> sequence of sakamotowase revealed that it contained a dysfunctional allele, e1-fs, that produced a loss-of-function truncated protein due to a premature stop codon, which arose as a consequence of a single-base deletion  <cit> . in contrast, the recessive allele e1-as possessed a nonsynonymous substitution in the putative nuclear localization signal, leading to reduced localization specificity of the e <dig> protein in nucleus and thereby reducing the ability of e <dig> to suppress expression of the gmft genes  <cit> . these findings strongly suggest that the molecular basis of the photoperiod insensitivity of sakamotowase is due, at least in part, to a complete lack of e <dig> function caused by a dysfunctional allele at the e <dig> locus itself. the dysfunctional allele e1-fs therefore may provide, singly or together with other unknown genes, another mechanism in the control of photoperiod insensitivity under the presence of e <dig> in soybean.

photoperiod responses of soybean involve not only pre-flowering growth, such as time to flowering, but also post-flowering vegetative and reproductive growth, such as duration of pod filling, development of the terminal inflorescence, and leaf senescence; ld conditions increase reproductive periods and delay leaf senescence and seed maturation of photoperiod-sensitive cultivars  <cit> . han et al.  <cit>  revealed that the post-flowering growth of a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar was influenced by exposure to r light and reversed by exposure to fr light during the dark period, suggesting that phytochromes control the photoperiod responses of post-flowering growth. however, understanding of the genetic and physiologic bases of post-flowering photoperiod sensitivity is still far from comprehensive.

soybean maturity genes control not only the time of flowering but also the time to maturation  <cit> . several qtls in various linkage groups have been identified to control features of the reproductive period, such as time of maturity and duration of pod filling  <cit> . however, only a few qtls for post-flowering photoperiod responses have been identified. cheng et al.  <cit>  found two qtls that controlled the duration of the post-flowering period under ld conditions. these two qtls, which appear to correspond to the e <dig> and e <dig> <cit>  genes, also were involved in the control of time to flowering  <cit> .

to survey the diverse mechanisms underlying photoperiod insensitivity in soybean and to search for novel genetic factors involved in this process, we first used allele-specific dna markers to catalog the genotypes of four maturity genes  in photoperiod-insensitive cultivars and breeding lines introduced from various geographic regions. we also tested the association of these various genotypes with pre- and post-flowering photoperiod responses. here we report that soybean has gained the trait of photoperiod insensitivity independently and repeatedly through diverse mechanisms. in addition, e <dig> and e <dig>  together with e <dig>  play important roles in not only floral initiation but also post-flowering photoperiod responses, such as maturation and stem termination, in soybean.

RESULTS
effects of photoperiod insensitivity on flowering
as in our previous studies  <cit> , we evaluated photoperiod sensitivity according to the difference in the time to flowering  between artificially induced ld and natural daylength  conditions. harosoy is a photoperiod-sensitive, early-maturing indeterminate cultivar: it possesses a maturity genotype of e1-as/e2/e3/e <dig>  and a dominant dt <dig> gene  <cit> . during the 2-year study period, this cultivar flowered at an average of  <dig> days after sowing  under nd conditions of sapporo, japan  but did not produce any flower buds during ld until the end of the artificially induced condition . similarly, harosoy nils for e <dig>  or e <dig>  did not form any flower buds until the end of the artificially induced ld condition, and they flowered slightly earlier during nd conditions than did harosoy; the average flowering time was  <dig> das for h-e <dig> and  <dig> das for h-e <dig>  in contrast, the harosoy nil for both e <dig> and e <dig>  flowered at  <dig> das under both nd and ld, and this line produced pods of  <dig> cm or longer  by the end of the artificially induced ld condition. all  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive accessions used in the current study flowered under ld conditions within  <dig> days after the date that they flowered under nd conditions.

classification of genotypes by use of allele-specific dna markers
the molecular bases of four maturity genes  have been determined  <cit> . to determine the allelic constitutions at the four loci, we genotyped the  <dig> genes in each of the  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive accessions by using previously reported allele-specific dna markers  <cit> .

four alleles have been identified at the e <dig> locus  <cit> . these alleles include two null alleles: one lacking a 130-kb region harboring the entire gene  and the other having a single-base deletion that leads to a frameshift mutation that generates a premature stop codon . the conventional recessive allele e <dig>  differs from the dominant allele  by a single amino acid substitution in the putative nuclear localization signal; this substitution abolishes nuclear localization of the protein. eight  of the  <dig> accessions had the e <dig> allele,  <dig> had e1-as, and  <dig> had e1-nl; only the japanese landrace ‘sakamotowase’ had the e1-fs allele .

two alleles of the e <dig> gene, a soybean ortholog of arabidopsis gigantea , have been identified: a functional dominant allele  and a recessive null allele   <cit> . all of the  <dig> accessions we tested had the e <dig> allele .

two and six alleles have previously been identified at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci, including one  and five  null alleles of the e <dig> and e <dig> loci, respectively  <cit> . of the  <dig> accessions,  <dig> had the e <dig> allele, and the remaining  <dig> accessions had the e <dig> allele. fifteen accessions had e <dig>  and the remaining  <dig> accessions had one of four dysfunctional alleles: e4-sore <dig> , e4-kam , e4-oto , and e4-kes  . only  <dig> accessions were double-recessive homozygotes for the e <dig> and e <dig> loci, whereas  <dig> accessions had either of the two dominant alleles, and  <dig> had both.

sequencing of the e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> genes
genotyping of the four maturity genes by using allele-specific markers indicated that, despite their photoperiod insensitivity,  <dig> accessions had dominant alleles at either or both of the e <dig> and e <dig> loci. this result suggests that a novel allele or gene may be involved in the control of this trait. we then sequenced the accessions having at least one dominant e <dig>  e <dig>  or e <dig> allele to examine whether these alleles were truly functional. no sequence variation was detected in the coding region of e <dig> in the eight accessions of the e1/e3/e <dig> genotype; all showed the same sequence as the published dominant e <dig> allele  <cit> . sequence analysis of the e <dig> gene similarly revealed no deviations from the published sequence  <cit>  in the  <dig> accessions tested. however, we found two novel dysfunctional alleles for the e <dig> gene among the  <dig> accessions initially scored as having the e1/e3/e <dig> or e1/e3/e <dig> genotype . one of these novel alleles was a nonsense mutation, in which a single-nucleotide substitution from c to t at position  <dig> from the adenine of the first codon in exon  <dig> created a stop codon in place of a codon encoding glutamine. the other novel allele had a premature stop codon in exon  <dig> that was generated by frameshifting due to the insertion of t at position  <dig> in exon  <dig>  we designated these dysfunctional alleles e3-ns and e3-fs, respectively, and renamed the conventional e <dig> allele as e3-tr , because it lacks the 3′ region of the gene, including exon  <dig>  <cit> .

we then developed allele-specific cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  or derived caps  markers to reliably identify these dysfunctional alleles . the e3-fs allele can be distinguished from the others after treatment with alei, which cleaves the 758- or 759-bp amplified product flanking the mutation site into fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp for the e <dig>  e3-ns, and e3-tr alleles but not e3-fs . the e3-ns allele can be distinguished from the others after treatment with mfei, which uniquely digests the 163-bp amplified e3-ns product into fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. most of the accessions, which were originally thought to contain the e <dig> allele, had dysfunctional alleles and thus produced truncated gmphya <dig> proteins.

we classified the  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive accessions into  <dig> multi-locus genotypes, and then grouped the alleles by function to subcategorize the accessions into  <dig> genotypic groups , where e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> refer to loss-of-function alleles at the respective locus . of these, a combination of dysfunctional alleles at both the e <dig> and e <dig> loci was predominant:  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions shared this genotype. of the  <dig> accessions with either the e <dig> or e <dig> allele,  <dig> had e1-fs or e1-nl at the e <dig> locus. the remaining seven accessions had the allelic combination of e1-as/e3/e <dig>  the same genotype as that of h-e <dig>  which is sensitive to the long days generated by an fr-enriched light source  <cit> , such as the incandescent lamps we used in the current study.

1) lower-case letters  indicate loss-of-function alleles at each locus, collectively.

collectively, all of the  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive accessions analyzed had a recessive allele at either the e <dig> or e <dig> locus. when one of these loci had a dominant allele, the e <dig> locus always had a loss-of-function e1-fs or e1-nl allele or the hypomorphic e1-as allele.

post-flowering photoperiod sensitivity associated with e <dig> and e4
the  <dig> accessions we tested were considered to be photoperiod insensitive in terms of time to flowering, because the difference in flowering dates between nd and ld conditions was small . however, these accessions differed markedly in their post-flowering vegetative and reproductive growth characteristics, such as reproductive period and stem growth after flowering . two-way analysis of variance, in which a combined mean square for interactions by years was used as an error mean square, revealed highly significant  differences for both traits among accessions, daylength conditions, and their interaction.

the date of maturation  was delayed more than  <dig> days during ld in  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions tested. this delay was accompanied by slower development of pods or by extension of the flowering period  due to the persistent vegetative activity of apical meristems at the main stem and branches during ld. the difference in reproductive period between nd and ld conditions, evaluated as the number of days from r <dig> to r <dig>  ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> days and varied with the multi-locus genotypes of the accessions . among the accessions of the e3/e <dig> genotype, the delay of maturation during ld was a maximum of  <dig> days, with an average of  <dig>  days. in contrast, the reproductive period was elongated by  <dig> days or more during ld compared with nd in  <dig> of the  <dig> accessions having either the e <dig> or e <dig> allele, with an average of  <dig>  days. the difference in reproductive period between nd and ld was, on average across accessions and years,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  days in the genotypic groups of e1/e3/e <dig>  e1/e3/e <dig>  and e1-as/e3/e <dig>  respectively . this result suggests that e <dig> and e <dig> were involved in photoperiodic control not only of time to flowering but also of time to pod maturation.

daylength also influenced stem termination after flowering in soybean . stem termination in soybean is known to be controlled by at least two genes, dt <dig> and dt <dig>  of which the former has a much greater effect  <cit> . the dt <dig> gene is an ortholog of arabidopsis terminal flower <dig> , gmtfl1b <cit> . four dysfunctional alleles  have been identified at this locus; all of these mutant alleles produce proteins containing single amino acid substitutions  <cit> . genotyping using allele-specific markers revealed that, of the  <dig> accessions,  <dig> had the dt <dig> allele, and  <dig> had the dt1-bb or dt1-tb allele .

determinate cultivars typically terminate stem growth shortly after flowering, whereas indeterminate ones continue stem growth until vegetative growth of the shoot apical meristem  ends  <cit> . as expected, our  <dig> determinate accessions that had the dt1-bb or dt1-tb allele produced almost the same number of nodes on the main stem during nd and ld . in contrast, the  <dig> indeterminate dt <dig> accessions produced more nodes during ld than during nd, and the differences in node number on the main stem between nd and ld varied with the multi-locus genotype . the difference was less than  <dig>   nodes among indeterminate accessions with the e3/e <dig> genotype and was independent of the e <dig> genotype ; that is, stem growth terminated shortly after flowering under both nd and ld conditions. in contrast, accessions with the e <dig> allele tended to produce more nodes during ld than during nd, and this response appeared to be dependent on the genotype  at the e <dig> locus . accessions having the e <dig>  allele  terminated stem growth similarly between nd and ld; the difference in node number between nd and ld was, on average,  <dig>  nodes across accessions and years . in contrast, accessions having the e1-as allele  produced at least  <dig>   more nodes during ld than during nd. therefore, post-flowering photoperiod growth in soybean, assessed as maturation and stem termination, varied among the accessions tested and with the maturity genotype.

control of post-flowering stem termination and pod development by e <dig> and e4
han et al.  <cit>  revealed that the post-flowering growth of a photoperiod-sensitive cultivar is influenced by the photoreaction that can be induced by exposure to r light and reversed by subsequent fr light exposure during the dark period. this pattern implies that phytochromes are involved in the photoperiod responses for post-flowering development in soybean. to confirm the different responses of post-flowering growth to photoperiod that we observed among the maturity genotypes in the field experiment, we analyzed pod development, stem termination, and the expression pattern of dt <dig> in stem tips under ld for harosoy  and its nils for e <dig>  e <dig>  and dt <dig>  we induced flowering in these lines as described in the methods section; sd treatment until  <dig> days after emergence  is sufficient to initiate and maintain flowering of harosoy under non-inductive ld conditions  <cit> . the soybean maturity genes, e <dig> and e <dig>  have been characterized in detail for the responses to long days with different r:fr ratios  <cit> . we thus used two ld conditions with different light sources, r-light-enriched and fr-light-enriched, to discriminate the functions of e <dig> and e <dig>  harosoy and its nils for e <dig>  e <dig>  and dt <dig>  flowered at almost the same time  under two lighting conditions. stem growth terminated at the 6th to 8th node in the harosoy nil for dt <dig> ; indeterminate lines produced more nodes than did h-dt <dig>  and the number of nodes produced until the end of experiment  varied with the maturity genotype . compared with h-dt <dig>  harosoy and h-e <dig> produced, on average,  <dig>  and  <dig>  more nodes under the r-light–enriched condition and  <dig>  to  <dig>  nodes more under the fr-light–enriched condition, respectively. h-e3/e <dig> and h-e <dig> terminated stem growth earlier than did harosoy and h-e <dig> under both conditions. in addition, stem growth terminated earlier in h-e3/e <dig> than in h-e <dig> under the fr-light–enriched condition, and h-e3/e <dig> produced almost the same number of nodes as did h-dt <dig> 

pod development showed a pattern slightly different from the results observed for stem growth . under the r-light–enriched condition, harosoy, h-e <dig>  and h-dt <dig> did not produce any pods longer than  <dig>  cm until  <dig> days after flowering, although they flowered at almost the same time as did h-e <dig> and h-e3/e <dig>  in contrast, h-e <dig> and h-e3/e <dig> produced, on average,  <dig>  and  <dig>  3-cm or longer pods under the r-light–enriched condition. in contrast, under the fr-light–enriched condition, h-e <dig> and h-e3/e <dig> produced  <dig>  and  <dig>  pods, respectively, whereas harosoy yielded only a few pods , and h-e <dig> made no pods; h-dt <dig> produced an average of  <dig>  pods . the pod development of h-dt <dig> in the fr-light–enriched condition may indicate that an r-light–enriched condition has a larger effect in controlling the development of pods after flowering than does the fr-light–enriched condition.

dt <dig> expression in determinate soybean plants rapidly decreases concomitant with floral induction, whereas this expression is maintained for a while after flowering starts in indeterminate accessions  <cit> . here we found that the expression of dt <dig> in the stem tips of 12-day-old plants grown in sd was very low under both r- and fr-enriched conditions, regardless of the genotype at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci . in addition, the expression level in h-dt <dig> remained very low at later growth stages. in contrast, the indeterminate lines  exhibited rapid increases in dt <dig> expression at  <dig> days after conversion to ld . thereafter, harosoy and h-e <dig> maintained dt <dig> expression at relatively high levels until  <dig> days after conversion to ld under the r-light–enriched condition , but dt <dig> expression decreased rapidly at  <dig> days and afterward under the fr-light–enriched condition . h-e <dig> had a similar but slightly lower level of expression than did harosoy and h-e <dig> under the fr-light–enriched condition , but the abundance of dt <dig> transcripts decreased rapidly at  <dig> days after conversion to ld in the r-light–enriched condition . in contrast to that in harosoy, h-e <dig>  and h-e <dig>  dt <dig> expression was low  in h-e3/e <dig> throughout all growth stages. these results therefore suggest that dt <dig> expression is under the control of two phya genes, e <dig> and e <dig>  for control of post-flowering growth, although a direct causative relationship between dt <dig> expression and the two phya genes should be addressed in a further study. this notion is in accordance with phya-regulated signal transduction of dt <dig> expression, which was expected given the presence in the dt <dig> promoter region of a sequence identical to the sorlip <dig> . the cis-element sequence found in dt <dig> is the most common cis-element in sorlips in arabidopsis genes that are induced or repressed by fr light  <cit> .

discussion
three major genetic groups confer photoperiod insensitivity in soybean
in the current study, we assessed the genotypes of  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive soybean cultivars at four maturity genes and a determinate growth-habit gene by using allele-specific dna markers that distinguished each of the recessive alleles from the others. these accessions have been introduced from various high-latitude geographic regions. our first goal was to determine whether there was any association between the genotypes at four major maturity loci  and photoperiod sensitivity. our second goal was to reveal any novel genetic factors that controlled photoperiod insensitivity in these diverse genetic resources. the photoperiod-insensitive cultivars and breeding lines we tested were classified into three genotypic groups according to the functions of the alleles at the respective loci: the e3/e <dig> group; the group containing e <dig>  and either e <dig> or e4; and the e1-as/e3/e <dig> group.

all of the  <dig> photoperiod-insensitive accessions tested had the dysfunctional allele at the e <dig> locus. the e <dig> gene is a soybean ortholog of arabidopsis gigantea   <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, gi regulates ft expression through multiple mechanisms: 1) gi binds to flavin-binding, kelch repeat, f box protein  <dig>  leading to degradation of a key co repressor , upregulation of the expression of constans , and subsequent activation of ft expression  <cit> ; 2) gi regulates the expression levels of mirna <dig>  whose targets encode repressors of ft, such as target of eat  <dig> and schlafmutze  <cit> ; and 3) gi modulates the stability or promoter accessibility of various ft repressors  <cit> , including short vegetative phase  <cit> , tempranillo   <dig>  and tem <dig>  <cit>  accordingly, the dysfunctional allele at the e <dig> locus likely is required for photoperiod insensitivity in these soybean accessions.

one of the three genotypic groups consisted of accessions that possessed the double-recessive genotype  at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci. these accessions accounted for approximately 70%  of the photoperiod-insensitive accessions tested, suggesting that dysfunction of phya is the most common mechanism underlying photoperiod insensitivity in soybean.

another genotypic group comprised the accessions having the dysfunctional e <dig> alleles  in combination with either a dominant e <dig> or e <dig> allele. this group contained sakamotowase, which has the e1-fs allele that yields a nonfunctional e <dig> protein, as has been revealed through transient expression assays  <cit> . in addition, the major qtl for photoperiod insensitivity in this line is tightly linked to the e <dig> locus  <cit> . these observations suggest that the photoperiod insensitivity of sakamotowase can be ascribed to the complete lack of e <dig> function. another dysfunctional allele, e1-nl, which lacks the entire e <dig> gene  <cit> , occurred fairly frequently  among the photoperiod-insensitive accessions we tested. the dysfunctional alleles e1-fs and e1-nl may have similar roles in abolishing or weakening the photoperiod responses regulated by the e <dig> or e <dig> allele. additional research is needed to determine whether these dysfunctional alleles at the e <dig> locus can singly lead to photoperiod insensitivity in the presence of the e <dig> or e <dig> allele.

the remaining genotypic group consisted of the accessions with the allelic combination of e1-as/e3/e <dig>  the harosoy nil for e <dig> also has the same allelic combination. however, this nil is sensitive to the ld conditions generated by using an fr-enriched light source , although it did not respond to the r-enriched ld condition  <cit> . therefore, the allelic combination of e1-as/e3/e <dig> is not sufficient to confer photoperiod insensitivity. it is conceivable that a novel gene—different from the dysfunctional alleles at the e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> loci—may be involved in the control of the photoperiod insensitivity of accessions of this genotype under the fr-enriched ld condition. gmphya <dig>  a homoeolog of e <dig>  is a possible candidate for this photoperiod-insensitivity controller: gmphya <dig> has been suggested to function in a redundant manner to the e <dig> allele in the de-etiolation responses of hypocotyls and in flowering under the fr-enriched ld condition  <cit> . the dysfunctional allele at the e <dig> locus has adverse effects on plant morphogenesis, such as an impaired de-etiolation response under fr light  <cit>  and the production of longer internodes under ld conditions relative to the e <dig> allele  <cit> , making the plant susceptible to lodging. accordingly, the use of the dominant e <dig> allele may contribute to the lodging tolerance of photoperiod-insensitive cultivars if another factor conditions the insensitivity. an appropriate combination of alleles should therefore be selected from among those representing diverse genetic mechanisms to adapt soybean cultivars to the conditions of the target environment.

multiple dysfunctional alleles have been detected for all of the e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> loci  <cit> , including two novel alleles at the e <dig> locus . our previous studies indicated that five loss-of-function alleles at the e <dig> locus originated recently and independently in different soybean landraces from east asia  <cit> . these results suggest that photoperiod insensitivity in soybean has arisen redundantly through multiple combinations of independently generated alleles at the e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> loci.

two phya genes, e <dig> and e <dig>  control post-flowering responses in soybean
another finding of the current study is that vegetative and reproductive growth characteristics after flowering, such as maturation and stem termination, were influenced by photoperiod responses regulated by the e <dig> and e <dig> loci. our findings are therefore in good agreement with previous observations regarding an association between photoperiod sensing and post-flowering responses  <cit>  and involvement of phytochrome in post-flowering responses  <cit> . we found that soybean accessions with different photoperiod-insensitive multi-locus genotypes responded differently to the photoperiod after flowering. despite their photoperiod insensitivity in regard to time to flowering, accessions that had either the e <dig> or e <dig> allele matured at least  <dig> days later under ld than nd conditions . furthermore, vegetative activity of the sam during ld persisted through late growth stages in the indeterminate accessions with allelic combinations of e1/e <dig> or e1-as/e <dig> to produce more nodes than did those grown under nd condition . these behaviors are in sharp contrast to those of the accessions of the e3/e <dig> group, which, independent of the type of allele or genotype at the e <dig> locus, matured without notable delays during ld relative to nd and terminated stem growth similarly under these two conditions .

the different photoperiod responses of post-flowering vegetative and reproductive growth that we observed among the various maturity genotypes were further confirmed through analyses with harosoy and its nils for e <dig>  e <dig>  and dt <dig>  plants among the nils in which we induced flowering by sd treatment for  <dig> dae exhibited different stem and pod growth under subsequent ld conditions. in particular, the nils with the e <dig> allele retained the vegetative activity of the sam of flower-induced plants and inhibited the pod development after flowering during ld conditions, whereas those with a recessive e <dig> allele terminated stem growth shortly after flowering to produce fewer nodes and developed pods under both of the light regimens . we also detected a slight effect of e <dig> only in the genetic background of e <dig> under the light regimen in which only fr-enriched lights were used to provide four hours of additional daytime subsequent to the 16-hour daytime period . our present results strongly suggest that post-flowering photoperiod responses in soybean are controlled by the e <dig> and e <dig> genes.

a proposed gene regulatory network for pre- and post-flowering photoperiod responses in soybean
we have summarized our current results as a gene network involving three maturity genes , a determinate habit gene , and two gmfts , that regulates the pre-flowering and post-flowering photoperiod responses of soybean under ld . in photoperiod-sensitive plants having the e <dig> or e1-as allele and a dominant allele at either the e <dig> or e <dig> locus  , we propose that flowering is not induced under fr-enriched ld  <cit>  because the e <dig> and e1-as alleles inhibit the gene expression of gmft2a and gmft5a <cit> . when those plants are exposed to a short period of sd, flowering is induced and persists even after the transfer to non-inductive ld, but subsequent seed maturation is delayed through the influence of an as yet unknown factor , and vegetative activity at sam is retained to produce more nodes due to dt <dig> expression. both factor y and dt <dig> are under the control of phya encoded at the e <dig> or e <dig> locus .

we propose that flowering in photoperiod-insensitive plants of the e3/e <dig> group, which has dysfunctional alleles at the e <dig> and e <dig> loci, is induced through the upregulation of gmfts in the absence of e <dig> expression  <cit> . flowering in e3/e <dig> plants is followed by normal seed maturation and stem termination, possibly due to downregulation of y and dt <dig>  respectively . the delayed maturity in some of the e3/e <dig> accessions in ld compared with nd  may be ascribed to the presence of a copy of the phya gene at a different locus   <cit>  or other photoreceptors.

in contrast, in photoperiod-insensitive plants that have a functional phya gene at either the e <dig> or e <dig> locus, we suggest that flowering is induced under ld either by loss-of-function alleles at the e <dig> locus in the e1/e3/e4–e1/e3/e <dig> group  or by an unknown genetic factor  in the e1-as/e3/e <dig> group . in contrast to the e3/e <dig> group, seed maturation in these two groups is delayed similarly under ld due to regulation by a functional phya gene . however, stem growth under ld differs between these groups: stem growth terminates earlier in the e1/e3/e4–e1/e3/e <dig> group than in the e1-as/e3/e <dig> group . in e1-as/e3/e <dig> plants, phya-mediated dt <dig> expression under ld may preserve vegetative activity at sam to produce more nodes, as indicated by the post-flowering responses of harosoy and its nils for e <dig> or e <dig> in ld .

these models prompt two questions regarding post-flowering growth in soybean. first, how does the e <dig> gene influence stem growth after flowering? apart from its effect on flowering and maturity, the role of the e <dig> gene in morphogenesis has not been determined, although it indeed influences various morphologic traits, yield, and other traits such as tolerance to chilling temperature  <cit> . the e <dig> and e1-as alleles inhibit the expression of gmft2a and gmft5a, which are under the control of phya genes  <cit> , whereas the loss-of-function alleles e1-fs and e1-nl do not. in arabidopsis, ft protein binds to flowering locus d  and promotes the expression of apetala <dig> and leafy, flower meristem genes  <cit> ; reviewed in  <cit> , which, in turn, suppresses tfl <dig> transcription and terminates stem growth  <cit> . therefore, the different effects of the alleles at the e <dig> locus on post-flowering stem growth might be ascribed not to a direct effect but rather to an indirect effect through suppression of gmft expression.

another question is whether flowering itself is a direct trigger for seed development in soybean. the findings we obtained in the current study indicate that phya-mediated photoperiod responses may regulate seed maturation directly or indirectly via an as yet unknown factor: only when two phya genes were dysfunctional did seed maturation after flowering under ld proceed without any marked delay . additional research therefore should explore key factors  in promoting seed development. comparing expression profiles during early seed development between sd-grown plants and those whose reproductive growth has reverted to a vegetative pattern may advance our understanding of the molecular bases of seed development in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study revealed diverse genetic mechanisms underlying photoperiod insensitivity in soybean. at least three multi-locus genotypes comprising various allelic combinations at the e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> loci can confer pre-flowering photoperiod insensitivity. these genotypes responded differently to photoperiod during post-flowering reproductive development, indicating involvement of the phya genes e <dig> and e <dig>  our results further indicate that flowering itself may not necessarily be a direct trigger for seed development. e <dig>  e <dig>  and e <dig> control the photoperiod responses for pre- and post-flowering development, which directly influences final seed yield in soybean.
