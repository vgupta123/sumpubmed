BACKGROUND
plexins are a highly conserved family of single pass transmembrane receptors which, in mammals, comprises nine genes grouped into four subfamilies  based on sequence homology  <cit> . they are characterized by a conserved sequence, the "sema domain", a structural domain that mediates protein-protein interaction, and phylogenetically links the plexins to the semaphorins and the scatter factor receptors  <cit> . the intracellular domain is highly conserved among the plexins but does not share striking homology with other known proteins. although the mechanisms of plexin-mediated signalling have not been well understood, they are known to impinge on cytoskeletal dynamics and on cell adhesion, e.g. by regulating monomeric gtpases of rho and ras families  <cit> .

plexins were initially characterized for their role in axon guidance, where they function, either alone or in complex with the neuropilins, as semaphorin receptors. subsequently, plexins were shown to control immune response and angiogenesis, and more recently were proposed to orchestrate tissue morphogenesis and cancer progression  <cit> . we have previously identified plexinb <dig> as the receptor for sema4d. upon ligand binding, plexinb <dig> regulates cytoskeletal remodeling , integrin activation , mapk signalling  <cit> , cytosolic tyrosine kinases   <cit> , and can trigger the activation of the tyrosine kinase receptors met and erbb- <dig>  <cit> .

it was also demonstrated that plexinb <dig> can mediate axon outgrowth  <cit>  and endothelial cell migration  <cit> . in addition, its ligand sema4d is a potent angiogenetic factor  <cit> , possibly involved in tumour induced angiogenesis  <cit> .

plexinb <dig> mrna expression has previously been shown in the nervous system  <cit>  and in diverse tissues at e <dig> of murine development  <cit> ; on the other hand, detailed information on the expression of sema4d mrna outside the nervous system is missing. notably, plexinb <dig> and sema4d expression at protein level by immunohistochemistry has not been reported yet. furthermore, little is known about the expression of sema4d and plexinb <dig> in the adult tissues.

in spite of extensive studies performed on plexins of a subfamily, molecular genetic studies to address the functional relevance in vivo of plexins-b are currently lacking. here we report our analysis of plexinb <dig> deficient mice, including functional studies to test the relevance of this semaphorin receptor in tumour induced angiogenesis.

RESULTS
plexinb <dig> and sema4d expression during embryo development and in the adult
in order to get insights to their physiological function, we investigated the tissue distributions of plexinb <dig> and sema4d in embryonic and adult tissues. initially, we explored plexinb <dig> mrna expression by dot blot analysis of human tissue  and by whole mount in situ hybridization of mouse embryos . taken together, these data revealed a wide expression of plexinb <dig> in various tissues, including nervous system, lung, kidney and liver.

in order to gain further evidence of plexinb <dig> expression at the protein level, we generated specific anti-plexinb <dig> antibodies , which we used to analyze further embryonic and adult tissues.

the immunohistochemical analysis of plexinb <dig> and sema4d expression revealed an intriguing distribution in developing organs characterized by epithelial branching morphogenesis, including the kidney, the lung and the pancreas. during epithelial branching morphogenesis, tissues are shaped by the outgrowth and branching of tubular epithelial structures, which invade the surrounding mesenchyme under the control of growth factors and guidance cues. we found that, at an early stage, plexinb <dig> is expressed in the mesenchyme surrounding epithelial tubules in kidney and lung  and in the pancreas , while sema4d is expressed by epithelial cells .

the developmental expression of this ligand-receptor pair appears to be dynamically regulated. for instance, in the lung at e <dig>  plexinb <dig> was expressed in cells of putative smooth muscle lineage recruited to wrap the differentiating airways ; conversely, in the adult, plexinb <dig> expression was mostly localized to bronchial epithelium . notably, while sema4d expression was clear in developing epithelia , it was undetectable in the adult lung .

in the adult kidney, we found an elevated expression of plexinb <dig> in distal tubules and collecting ducts , while sema4d displays a complementary expression in the pars convoluta of proximal tubules .

in the mouse liver, we could not clearly detect plexinb <dig> expression during early embryonic stages , though we found a high expression of plexinb <dig> in adult hepatocytes . surprisingly, we could not detect sema4d expression in the liver at any stage , suggesting sema4d-independent activities of plexinb <dig> in this tissue.

consistent with previous reports  <cit> , in the nervous system we detected plexinb <dig> expression in sensory and motor neurons, but were particularly attracted by the distinctive expression of plexinb <dig> and sema4d during cerebellar development. during postnatal development, purkinje cell  dendrites expand into the nascent molecular layer, to form extensive connections with granule cell axons . in the p <dig> cerebellum, plexinb <dig> is exclusively expressed in purkinje cells, being distributed in the perikaryon, dendritic tree and axon, up to the terminal branches in the deep cerebellar nuclei . at the same developmental stage it was shown that sema4d is expressed by myelinating oligodendrocytes in the folial white matter  <cit> . in the mature cerebellum plexinb <dig> expression remains selectively confined to pk cells. moreover, labelling intensity of pk axons now reveals a clear cut rostro-caudal gradient, with higher levels of expression in the posterior cortical lobules . in addition, analysis of frontal sections shows differential expression along parasagittally oriented pk cell subpopulations . at this age, anti-sema4d antibodies show a diffuse distribution pattern in the molecular layer, suggesting expression in parallel fibres .

generation of plexinb <dig> null mutant
to investigate the functional relevance of plexinb <dig> in vivo, we undertook the genomic targeting of the murine gene to obtain plexinb1-deficient mice. to this end, we generated a targeting construct in which we placed exon  <dig> and  <dig> of the plexinb <dig> gene  between two loxp sites . furthermore, we inserted a neo cassette, flanked by two frp sites and followed by a lacz reporter fused to the first exon of the intracellular portion of the plexinb <dig> gene; this allowed us, upon flp recombination, to also obtain knock-in plexinb <dig> mutants. the correct targeting of the construct in the genome of es cells was confirmed by southern blot analysis . chimeric mice, obtained from a positive es cell clone, were mated with a cre deleter strain to achieve gene inactivation, and eventually backcrossed into c57bl/ <dig> genetic background. the actual deletion of exons  <dig> and  <dig> in mouse genome, encoding for the transmembrane region of plexinb <dig>  was confirmed by pcr analysis .

by crossing heterozygous mice, we obtained plexinb <dig> homozygous mutant mice, which were born and developed normally into adulthood. the genotypic analysis revealed the expected mendelian ratios in littermates . we confirmed the absence of plexnb <dig> mrna in homozygous mutant by rt pcr analysis . moreover, we analyzed tissue extracts of mutant and control mice by western blotting by means of an antibody directed to the intracellular domain of the receptor, and confirmed that the expression of plexinb <dig> was abrogated in homozygous mutant mice at the protein level .

the genotyping of littermates born from heterozygous Ã— heterozygous breeding pairs showed the expected mendelian ratio.

plexinb <dig> deficient mice do not display major developmental defects
plexinb <dig> mutant mice did not show any detectable difference in size and were undistinguishable from their wild type  littermates; in addition, their feeding behaviour and weaning appeared to be regular, they developed normally and did not show defects in reproduction or fertility. moreover, we measured some of the main blood parameters  and found them to be normal . thus we undertook a histological analysis of embryonic and adult tissues in plexinb <dig> null mice.

lung development provides a prototypic example of branching morphogenesis and semaphorins and plexins were shown to play a role during this morphogenetic process  <cit> . however, upon histological examination we failed to reveal any obvious abnormality in the morphology of lung epithelium or in the septation of the airways in plexinb <dig> null mice . besides, the alveoli were properly inflated and the respiration occurred normally in all the animals analyzed.

in the kidney plexinb <dig> is highly expressed; however, the histological analysis of mutant mice did not reveal any gross defect or abnormality in tubules or nephrons . these specialized structures develop as the result of an intricate dialogue between the epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchyme, and these results implicate that plexinb <dig> is not essential during nephrogenic induction. furthermore, the number of renal glumeruli were counted and found to be similar in wt and mutant mice . because significant defects in kidney function may not implicate gross histological abnormalities and because plexinb <dig> is also expressed in the adult, we performed blood tests on two major indicators of renal function, creatinine and urea levels, which turned out to be comparable in normal and mutant mice .

we furthermore examined the liver parenchyma, where plexinb <dig> is strongly expressed in wt mice. the haematoxylin/eosin staining revealed no sign of fibrosis, steatosis or other particular abnormality in mutant mice . we performed blood tests to check two major indicators of liver function: i.e. plasma concentration of fibrinogen and total proteins. in addition, we measured blood levels of hepatic transaminases , which are elevated in the presence of liver disorders, and we assessed the integrity of biliar tree by measuring the blood levels of gamma-glutamil-transferase and alkaline phosphatase. none of these analyses revealed significant differences between wt and mutant mice .

crea: creatinine

got: glutamic oxalacetic transaminase

gpt: glutamic piruvic transaminase

ggt: gamma-glutamil-transferase

fib: fibrinogen

tp: total protein

as mentioned above, we found the highest plexinb <dig> protein expression in the central nervous system within the cerebellum. however, in plexinb <dig> null mice, the overall cerebellar morphology of the cerebellum appeared normal and we could not reveal any abnormality in the foliation of lobuli or in the number of pk cells . in the cerebellum, myelin formation starts from the first postnatal week, in a period in which sema4d is expressed by the olygodendrocytes  <cit> . this prompted us to scrutinize the myelination process of pk axons by means of confocal analysis. in fact, anti-myelin basic protein  staining showed a correct wrapping of pk axons by the glial cells . in addition, pk axons were immunolabeled with anti-calbindin  in the mutant mice, revealing a normal axon patterning. furthermore, the collateral branching of pk axons in the infraganglionic plexus, which is normally confined in the most superficial portion of the granular layer  <cit> , did not show any abnormality . also, the dendritic arborization of pk cell in the molecular layer appeared normal in the mutant mice . these data suggest that, although plexinb <dig> is abundantly expressed in pk cells, its function doesn't seem to be essential for proper development of cerebellar pk cells.

axonal growth cones from plexinb <dig> mutants fail to collapse in response to sema4d
we thought to exploit these mutants as a genetic tool to investigate the functional requirement of plexinb <dig> in assays previously used to study sema4d signalling. for instance, it was demonstrated that the axonal growth cones of cultured hippocampal neurons undergo collapse in response to sema4d in vitro, and it was proposed that this response is mediated by plexinb <dig> receptor  <cit> . we observed that plexinb <dig> is expressed by hippocampal neurons, although at a lower level compared to pk cells ; however, the evidence that plexinb <dig> is responsible for the transduction of sema4d repulsive signals in these neurons is still lacking. thus, to verify whether this functional response is abrogated in plexinb <dig> deficient mice, hippocampal neurons derived from wt or mutant mice were cultured for  <dig> hours ex vivo and then incubated with sema4d for  <dig> hour. while the number of collapsed growth cones in wild type neurons was strongly increased upon sema4d stimulation, plexinb <dig> -/- hippocampal neurons did not collapse and underwent normal axonal outgrowth and differentiation, irrespective of sema4d treatment . this establishes a functional requirement for plexinb <dig> in the repelling activity of sema4d in hippocampal neurons. we then examined the overall histology and the cellular composition of the hippocampus in plexinb <dig> knock-out mice. moreover, we analysed the cytoarchitectonic and the connection pattern of hippocampal neurons  and interneurons . however, we did not observe obvious abnormalities of this neural structure in mutant mice , consistent with a compensation of sema4d function in the development of the hippocampus.

plexinb <dig> is dispensable for tumour-induced angiogenesis
sema4d is a potent angiogenetic factor in vivo  <cit>  and it is released by many tumour cells . furthermore, it was shown that inhibiting the expression of sema4d in human head and neck carcinoma cells leads to reduction of tumour burden and vascularity in a mouse xenograft model  <cit> .

in fact, the so called "angiogenic switch", i.e. the ability of tumour cells to recruit new vessels in order to provide blood supply, is a basic step in solid tumour growth and metastatic dissemination. without overcoming this rate-limiting step, most tumours cannot grow over  <dig> mm in diameter, nor metastasize. plexinb <dig> is known to transduce sema4d signals in vitro and it is expressed in huvec endothelial cells and in the tumour vessels in vivo  <cit> , however its requirement in tumour angiogenesis has not been clearly established.

we reasoned that, if plexinb <dig> would play a major role in this process, its ablation would impact on tumour angiogenesis, leading to reduced growth rate and metastatization of cancer cells. to test this, we exploited the well established b <dig> melanoma model, which is syngenic with the c57bl <dig> background of our mutants, and that we found to produce sema4d . melanoma cells were injected orthotopically in the subcute of wt, heterozygous and homozygous plexinb <dig> mutant; tumour growth was followed over time, and tumour explants were eventually weighted at the end of the experiment after  <dig> days. we did not observe any significant difference between the slope of tumour growth curve or in the final weight of the tumours grown in wt or plexinb <dig> null mice . moreover, we counted the number of lung metastases formed by tumours in normal and homozygous mutant mice and we did not observe significative differences .

to scrutinize further vessel growth within the primary tumours, we stained tissue sections with an antibody against cd <dig> endothelial marker, and analyzed them by fluorescence microscopy. we could not reveal morphological differences between tumour vessels in mutant and wt mice. in addition, we quantified total vessel area and vessel density  in tumour sections. in both cases, we did not measure a significant change in plexinb <dig> -/- compared to wt mice.

discussion
plexins were originally characterized for their role in the wiring of neural network as receptors for semaphorin guidance cues. however, accumulating lines of evidence later prompted the investigators to reappraise and revise the biological role of these molecules. first, it was found that many plexins are widely expressed outside the nervous system. moreover, as the signal transduction mechanisms start to be uncovered, it is now clear that plexins can impinge on a range of signaling pathways potentially regulating cell adhesion, cell proliferation and differentiation.

here we demonstrate, by immunohistochemical analysis, the expression of plexinb <dig> receptor and of its ligand sema4d in diverse epithelial tissues and in the nervous system, suggesting that plexinb <dig> might play multiple functional roles in vivo, during development and in the adult stage. in fact, this is the first extensive analysis, in the mouse embryo and in the adult, of plexinb <dig> and sema4d tissue distribution undertaken so far.

previous expression studies and experiments in vitro had highlighted a potential role for secreted semaphorins and their receptors during tubular morphogenesis in the lung  <cit>  and in the kidney  <cit> , and it was hypothesized that these guidance cues may define permissive and restricted regions for cell migration. interestingly, based on our expression analysis, sema4d-plexinb <dig> signaling might have a role in this function, for instance at the boundaries between different cell populations. moreover, plexinb <dig> can regulate the activation of met  <cit> , a tyrosine kinase receptor known to mediate tubular morphogenesis in fetal lung and kidney  <cit> . in spite of these facts, the genetic deletion of plexinb <dig> did not lead to morphological or functional abnormalities, indicating that the function of this semaphorin receptor is redundant in development. notably, developing kidney and lung also express plexinb <dig>  <cit> , another putative sema4d receptor  <cit> . although we observed that plexinb <dig> binds to sema4d with lower affinity than plexinb <dig> , it is conceivable that plexinb <dig> can compensate for the lack of plexinb <dig> in these organs. in fact, by measuring plexinb <dig> mrna levels in tissues with real time pcr, we found significant expression in liver and kidney, which did not increase in plexinb1-deficient mice .

these findings are in line with that found in previously reported mouse mutants of semaphorins or plexins expressed in developing lung , which also lack to show obvious abnormalities of these organs  <cit> . thus, this scenario suggests a high level of redundancy in semaphorin signaling during branching morphogenesis and in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in lung and kidney. moreover, since additional guidance cues are known to regulate these developmental processes, it is conceivable that the absence of semaphorin signals may be compensated by functionally related morphogenetic factors such as the netrins and the slits .

in contrast to the lung and the kidney, plexinb <dig> expression in the liver is not consistent with a function as receptor for sema4d, since we could not detect significant expression of this semaphorin in the mouse liver at any stage. this may suggest that hepatocytes or other liver cells express as yet unidentified alternative ligands for plexinb <dig>  furthermore, since it was shown that plexins can associate in receptor complexes on the cell surface  <cit>  or regulate homophilic cell-cell adhesion  <cit> , it is also possible that plexinb <dig> acts in the maintenance of liver tissue architecture by functionally regulating other receptors or homologous plexins.

it was previously shown that sema4d-plexinb <dig> signalling can collapse the growth cone of hippocampal neurons in culture  <cit> . interestingly, we have observed loss of responsiveness to sema4d in plexinb1-deficient neurons derived from our mutants. on the other hand, our histological analysis revealed that the overall morphology, cell composition and neural connections in the hippocampus do not display obvious abnormalities in the absence of plexinb <dig>  suggesting a compensation of sema4d function in development.

in the cerebellum, plexinb <dig> is highly expressed in purkinje  cells during the postnatal development. notably, these neurons do not express plexinb <dig> or cd <dig>  which are lower affinity receptors for sema4d  <cit> . incidentally, it was shown that pk cells express plexinb <dig>  <cit> , but we previously demonstrated that this receptor cannot bind sema4d  <cit> . plexinb <dig> distribution in the cerebellum appears consistent with the traditional role of plexins as receptors for neurite outgrowth inhibitory cues. in fact, during the first postnatal days, purkinje axons show exuberant sprouting of collateral branches that are eventually pruned during cerebellar development  <cit> . the final shaping of pk axons is associated with the axonal myelination mediated by the olygodendrocytes that express sema4d  <cit> . however, our analysis shows that pk axons are correctly myelinated and the pruning of excessive branches occurs normally in the plexinb <dig> mutant mice. it is noteworthy that plexinb <dig> in pk cells is also present in the perikaryon and dendrites. in addition, the protein shows different levels of expression in pk cell subsets, corresponding to morphofunctional modules of the cerebellar cortex  <cit> . together with the precise distribution of sema4d in the molecular layer, these observations suggest that sema4d-plexinb <dig> signalling may play a role in regulating the patterning and plasticity of intracortical connectivity, although this may be compensated during cerebellar development by alternative pathways.

the absence of clear developmental defects in plexinb <dig> mutants is consistent with that reported for sema4d-deficient mice. in fact, the latter were only found to have minor defects in the immune response, likely attributed to defective cd <dig> signaling  <cit> , which is an alternative low-affinity receptor for sema4d expressed in lymphocytes.

our expression analysis had revealed that plexinb <dig> is importantly expressed in a number of adult tissues, potentially suggesting a physiological role beyond embryo development. to address this point, in addition to study tissue histology, we have performed blood tests to investigate major functions in plexinb1-deficient mice. our data show that liver and kidney functions were normal. in addition, we found that hematopoiesis and coagulation parameters were not affected .

furthermore, it was proposed that plexinb <dig> expressed by endothelial cells may mediate the pro-angiogenic activity of sema4d released by tumour cells  <cit> . tumour-induced angiogenesis is of fundamental importance in cancer progression; in fact, hampering the formation of new vessels is now a popular strategy to restrain tumour growth. in order to test the functional requirement for plexinb <dig> in this process, we exploited b <dig> melanoma transplants, which are commonly used to study tumour growth and angiogenesis in the context of syngenic c57bl/ <dig> mouse models. we found that b <dig> cells produce sema4d and tested their ability to grow and induce angiogenesis in plexinb1-deficient mice. our results suggest that the angiogenic activity of sema4d may be mediated not only by plexinb <dig>  but also via other receptors expressed in endothelial cells . future studies will tell whether other tumour models are equally capable to grow in a plexinb1-deficient tissue microenvironment.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our data concerning plexinb <dig> and sema4d expression suggest that plexinb <dig> may carry out multiple functions during development and in the adult. nonetheless, our analysis of plexinb <dig> mutant mice did not show any major impairment in embryo development or differentiated functions in the adult, including the neo-angiogenetic response induced by tumour growth. we conclude that plexinb <dig> plays a redundant role during development, in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and in tumour angiogenesis.
