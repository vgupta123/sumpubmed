BACKGROUND
in eukaryotic cells the confinement of the genetic material and the transcriptional machinery to the nucleus allows the regulation of central processes including gene expression, signal transduction and control of the cell cycle. one of the key features of such regulation is the selective bi-directional transport of several proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. such transport happens through large membrane structures termed nuclear pore complexes , comprised of approximately  <dig> proteins collectively termed nucleoporins 
 <cit> . the mechanism of translocation through the pore is not well understood, but is facilitated by a number of nuclear transport factors or carrier proteins termed karyopherins
 <cit> . in higher eukaryotes, as well as in the yeast s. cerevisiae, the karyopherins that mediate nuclear import of proteins and rnas are generally known as importins
 <cit> , whereas those mediating nuclear export are known as exportins
 <cit> . importins associate with their macromolecular cargo in the cytoplasm, either directly or indirectly via adaptor proteins
 <cit> . cargo release is achieved by association of the importins with the gtpase ran  in the gtp-bound form 
 <cit> . nuclear export is essentially the reciprocal process, with cargo recognition occurring in the nucleus in the presence of gsp <dig> and cargo complexes dissociating in the cytoplasm upon gtp hydrolysis. gsp <dig> is present at high concentrations in the nucleus in the gtp-bound form, and mainly in the gdp-bound form in the cytoplasm
 <cit> . this compartmentalization depends on the localization of the proteins that regulate the nucleotide state of gsp <dig>  gtp hydrolysis requires a gtpase-activating protein  that is present in the cytoplasm. conversely, the exchange of gdp to gtp is catalyzed by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor  that is bound to the chromatin
 <cit> . importin-β  was first identified as the transport factor for proteins carrying classical nuclear localization signals , such as those of nucleoplasmin or the sv <dig> t antigen
 <cit> . importin-β hardly ever binds these classical nlss directly, but binds importin-α , which in turn binds these nlss
 <cit> . while this pathway is termed the classical nuclear import pathway, several alternative import pathways have been characterized. most karyopherins bind their cargos directly, and even importin-β, in some cases, is able to recognize cargo substrates without the need for an importin-α  adaptor protein, as in the case of ribosomal proteins

mig <dig> was identified several years ago as a repressor that collaborates with mig <dig> to cause glucose-induced repression of the suc <dig> gene
 <cit> . a genome wide expression profiling survey of the yeast genome revealed that all the genes regulated by mig <dig> are also regulated by mig <dig>  thus, it was postulated that mig <dig> always works in conjunction with mig1
 <cit> . however, mig <dig> appears to be the essential component, since its presence is necessary and sufficient to cause full repression of most genes even in the absence of mig <dig>  mig <dig> is a zinc-finger protein that binds to the promoters of many genes repressing their transcription
 <cit> . mig <dig> promoter binding is regulated by hxk <dig> and snf <dig> proteins. hxk <dig> has a regulatory role in glucose repression and this is dependent on its interaction with mig <dig>  together, they form a repressor complex located in the nucleus of s. cerevisiae. in high glucose, nuclear hxk <dig> stabilizes the complex by blocking mig <dig> s <dig> phosphorylation by snf <dig> protein kinase and this is important for glucose repression signaling
 <cit> . in low-glucose, hxk <dig> serine- <dig> and mig <dig> serine- <dig> phosphorylation trigger their export from the nucleus by the xpo <dig> and msn5-dependent pathways, respectively
 <cit> . thus, hxk <dig> and mig <dig> become mainly cytoplasmic
 <cit>  and this initiates the expression of several genes regulated by glucose repression.

recently, it has been described that mig <dig> moves between the nucleus and mitochondria in a glucose-dependent manner
 <cit> . however, the mechanisms by which mig <dig> enters into and leaves the nucleus are largely unknown. since mig <dig> is too large to translocate through the npc by diffusion, its transport across the nuclear envelope is probably mediated by carrier proteins. in this study, we show that the mig <dig> protein is an import cargo of the importin-β  carrier in s. cerevisiae. we also show that mig <dig> interacts with kap <dig> in the presence of gsp <dig> without the participation of other auxiliary proteins. moreover, mig2-kap <dig> interaction depends on a mig <dig> nls motif located between lysine- <dig> and arginine- <dig>  the observed mig2-kap <dig> interaction is not required for mig <dig> entry into the nucleus and does not require the nls motif of the mig <dig> protein. we also demonstrate that mig <dig> is recognized by kap <dig> in the cytoplasm in the presence of gsp1-gdp and cargo complexes dissociate in the nucleus upon the gdp/gtp exchange in the gsp <dig> protein.

fluorescence microscopy
yeast strains expressing the mig2-gfp, mig2nls1-gfp and mig2nls2-gfp were grown to early-log phase  in yepd medium. half of the culture was shifted to yepgly medium for 1 h. cells  were loaded onto poly l-lysine-coated slides, and the remaining suspension was immediately withdrawn by aspiration. one microliter of dapi  was added, and a cover slide was placed over the microscope slide. gfp and dapi localization in cultures was monitored by direct fluorescence using a leica dm5000b microscope. to avoid the non-linear range of fluorescent signals, cells highly overexpressing gfp-tagged fusion protein were excluded from further analyses. the localization of proteins was monitored by visual inspection of the images. at least  <dig> cells were scored in each of at least three independent experiments. the distribution of fluorescence was scored in the following way: n, denotes a nuclear fluorescence signal; m, mitochondrial fluorescent signal without nuclear fluorescence signal. images representative of the results obtained are shown. images were processed using adobe photoshop cs <dig> 

statistical analysis
data were obtained from at least  <dig> independent experiments. results are shown as the mean ± standard error .

preparation of crude protein extracts
yeast protein extracts were prepared as follows: yeasts were grown in  <dig> to 20 ml of yepd  at 28°c to an optical density at 600 nm of  <dig> . half of the culture was shifted to yepgly  for 1 h. cells were collected, washed twice with 1 ml of 1 m sorbitol and resuspended in 200 μl pbs buffer  containing roche protease inhibitor plus 1 mm dtt and  <dig> % triton x <dig>  the cells were broken using a fastprep homogenizer . two pulses of 20s at  <dig>  m/s were given in the presence of glass beads. then, 200 μl of pbs buffer were added to the suspension. after centrifugation at  <dig>  x g for 30 min at 4°c, the supernatant was used as crude protein extract.

enzyme assay
invertase activity was assayed in whole cells as previously described
 <cit>  and expressed as micromoles of glucose released per minute and 100 mg of cells .

immunoblot analysis
mutant or wild-type yeast cells were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of  <dig>  in yepd medium containing high-glucose  and shifted to low-glucose conditions for 1 h. the cells were collected by centrifugation  and crude extracts were prepared as described above. for western blotting,  <dig> to 40 μg of proteins were separated by sds-12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and transferred to an enhanced chemiluminescence pvdf transfer membrane  by electroblotting. the membrane was then incubated with anti-gfp , anti-kap <dig>  or anti-kap <dig>  as primary antibodies and the appropriate secondary antibody later. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-a was used as secondary reactant. west pico chemiluminescent system  was used for detection.

co-immunoprecipitation assay
immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using whole cell extracts from different strains. the extracts were incubated with anti-kap <dig>  anti-kap <dig> or anti-pho <dig> polyclonal antibodies for 3 h at 4°c. protein a-sepharose beads  were then added and incubated for 3 h at 4°c in a spinning wheel. after extensive washing with pbs plus  <dig> % deoxycholate buffer, immunoprecipitated samples were boiled in sds-loading buffer . the proteins were separated in a 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel , transferred to an enhanced chemiluminicence pvdf membrane and immunobloted as described above using anti-gfp monoclonal antibodies. values shown are representative results from individual experiments.

gst pull-down experiments
e. coli cells from the bl <dig> plyss strain were transformed with the fusion protein expression vectors pgex/mig <dig> and pgex/mig2nls <dig>  cells were grown to a600nm  <dig> - <dig> , induced with  <dig>  mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37°c for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. the pellet was resuspended in pbs buffer  and sonicated. insoluble material was removed by centrifugation . the soluble extract was incubated with glutathione-sepharose 4b  for 1 h at 4°c, washed extensively with pbs buffer and resuspended in the same buffer. the mig2-gst and mig2nls1-gst fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-sepharose were incubated with yeast whole cell extracts from the wild-type strain  for 1 h at 4°c in pbs buffer. the cell extracts were obtained from yeast cells grown in yepd medium containing high-glucose  and shifted to  <dig> % glucose plus 3% glycerol  for 1 h. beads were gently washed five times with  <dig>  ml of pbs buffer, boiled in 25 μl sample-loading buffer, and analyzed by sds-page followed by western blot using anti-kap <dig> or anti-kap <dig> antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein-a. bound antibodies were detected using the west pico chemiluminescent system .

gst fusion protein expression vectors pgex-kap <dig>  pgex-kap <dig> and pgex-gsp <dig> were transformed into e. coli strain bl <dig> plyss. cells were grown to a600nm  <dig> - <dig> , induced with  <dig>  mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37°c for 3 h, and collected by centrifugation. cell pellets were resuspended in pbs buffer and sonicated. the gst-kap <dig>  gst-kap <dig> and gst-gsp <dig> fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-sepharose beads were incubated with  <dig>  units of thrombin  for site-specific separation of the gst affinity tag from kap <dig>  kap <dig> and gsp <dig> proteins. affinity-purified gsp <dig> was immediately loaded with gtp or gdp by adding 30 mm k2po <dig> , 1 mm gtp or 1 mm gdp and 10 mm edta . then, it was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, supplemented with 20 mm magnesium acetate, incubated on ice for 30 min, and frozen at -80°c
 <cit> . gsp1-mediated kap95/kap <dig> interactions with mig <dig> were analyzed by incubating purified kap <dig> or kap <dig> with gst-mig <dig> bound to glutathione-sepharose beads in the presence of gsp <dig> or gsp <dig> for 1 h at 4°c in pbs buffer. beads were washed and analyzed as described above.

RESULTS
the karyopherin msn <dig>  is not essential for mig <dig> nuclear import
the karyopherin msn <dig> is required for nuclear export of mig <dig>  a transcriptional repressor of s. cerevisiae <cit> . since the msn <dig> protein functions both as a nuclear importin and exportin carrier
 <cit>  and mig <dig> and mig <dig> proteins have several common structural motifs and functions, we first tested for a possible role of msn <dig> in mig <dig> nuclear import.

thus, nuclear accumulation of mig2-gfp was determined in Δmsn <dig> mutant cells by fluorescence microscopy, as compared to wild-type cells. the fmy <dig>  and fmy <dig>  strains showed identical nuclear distributions of mig2-gfp growing in high and low glucose conditions. in high glucose conditions, nuclear accumulation of mig <dig> was observed, although cytoplasmic background fluorescence was also detected and after a 5 min shift to low glucose-glycerol medium, strong green fluorescence of the characteristic branched tubular mitochondrial network was observed .

these results demonstrate that mig2-gfp enters and exits from the nucleus both in the presence and absence of the msn <dig> protein. this suggests that msn <dig> is not implicated in either mig <dig> nuclear import or export.

nuclear import of mig <dig> is altered in a kap95ts mutant strain but not in kap60ts mutant cells
kap <dig> normally binds proteins through a highly basic stretch close to its n-terminus, resulting in the recruitment of kap <dig> and formation of a heterotrimeric complex that facilitates nuclear import
 <cit> . the carrier kap <dig> recognizes two classes of nlss matching the consensus kx1-31- <dig> and x1-3x10-123- <dig>  the first class, known as monopartite nls, has a single cluster of basic amino acid residues and the second class, known as bipartite nls, has two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10- <dig> amino acid linker
 <cit> . since mig <dig> presents two monopartite nls motives 32kkrhlr <dig> and 75rrlkk <dig>  we hypothesized that the kap60/kap <dig> complex may mediate the nuclear import of mig <dig>  to test this, we analyzed the subcellular localization of mig2-gfp in temperature-sensitive kap60ts and kap95ts mutant cells. the kap60ts and kap95ts mutants were grown at the permissive temperature  in high glucose conditions and then shifted to low glucose conditions for 1 h. then, the high and low glucose cultures were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature  for 1 h. as can be seen in figure 
 <dig>  a similar accumulation of mig <dig> was detected in the nuclei and mitochondria of wild-type, kap60ts and kap95ts mutant cells grown at permissive temperature . in high glucose conditions mig <dig> mostly accumulates in the nucleus  but in low-glucose conditions, mig <dig> rapidly moves to the mitochondrial network . rfp fused to the presequence of subunit  <dig> of the mitochondrial fo-atpase protein was used as a mitochondrial marker and, as seen in figure 
2a, mig2-gfp largely colocalized with su9-rfp protein. thus, under nutritional stress, mig <dig> is essentially a mitochondria associated protein. moreover, mig <dig> translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria is reversible, because mig <dig> localizes back to the nucleus after a shift from low to high glucose conditions
 <cit> .

however, in kap95ts mutant cells incubated at the non-permissive temperature  and both in high and low-glucose conditions, 98% of the mig <dig> protein was located in the mitochondrial network and no nuclear accumulation of mig <dig> was observed in high glucose conditions after 1 h of culture . in contrast, in kap60ts mutant cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature  in high glucose conditions, 80% of cells showed nuclear accumulation of the mig <dig> protein , whereas if we used a positive control such as hxk2
 <cit> , in kap60ts mutant cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, no nuclear accumulation of hxk2nes <dig> was observed after  <dig> and 5 h of culture . these results suggest that the kap <dig> protein is necessary for nuclear import of mig <dig>  but the kap <dig> protein does not participate in this process.

mapping residues necessary for nls function
we next determined whether the two putative mig <dig> nls sequences are necessary for the entry of mig <dig> into the nucleus. in order to investigate this, the putative nls sequences were mutated and tested for their function. the presence of basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine appears to be an important feature of the nlss
 <cit> . thus, we created two mig2gfp mutants in which three basic residues of either nls <dig> or nls <dig> were replaced by alanine residues to generate mig2k32ak33ar37agfp  and mig2r75ar76ak79agfp . analysis of the intracellular localization of the different mig2-gfp variants by fluorescence microscopy showed that the mig2nls2-gfp fusion protein accumulated in the nuclei  in high-glucose conditions . however, in high glucose conditions the mig2nls1-gfp protein was excluded from the nuclei and a mitochondrial  accumulation was detected . thus, the nls <dig> mutation causes a strong defect in the nuclear import of mig <dig> 

accordingly, we hypothesize that consistent with the inability of the mutant mig2nls <dig> protein to enter into the nucleus in vivo ; the mutants lacking the nls <dig> must be unable to signal glucose repression in a Δmig <dig> mutant strain. thus, we investigated the mig2-dependent glucose signaling function in the presence and absence of the mig <dig> protein . the cells were grown in yepd complex medium to an a600nm of  <dig>  and the exocellular invertase activity was determined in whole cells as a glucose repression marker. the specific activity of invertase shows identical strong derepression in both Δmig1Δmig <dig> and Δmig1mig2nls <dig> mutant strains. however, in the Δmig1mig2nls <dig> mutant strain a derepression level similar to the Δmig <dig> strain was observed. these results confirm the above finding, that the strain expressing mig2nls <dig> has lost nuclear import capacity and thus cannot exert its function as a transcriptional repressor.

mig <dig> interacts with kap <dig> and kap95
to test whether mig <dig> binds to kap <dig> and kap <dig> in vivo we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay on cells expressing mig2-gfp and gfp as control. cell extracts from fmy <dig>  or tetr-gfp were immunoprecipitated with anti-kap <dig> and anti-kap <dig> antibodies. the resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for the presence of mig2-gfp or gfp by immunoblot analysis with anti-gfp antibodies. as shown in figure 
4a, specific signals of mig2-gfp were observed with samples immunoprecipitated with both anti-kap <dig> and anti-kap <dig> antibodies in the strain expressing mig2-gfp either in high and low glucose conditions. however, no signals were observed when the experiment was done using the strain expressing gfp although similar amounts of gfp were detected in the immunoprecipitates when anti-gfp antibody was used . these results indicated that the glucose levels do not affect the affinity of mig <dig>  since the mig2-gfp interaction with kap <dig> and kap <dig> proteins was similar with samples from high and low glucose-grown cultures. thus, our data suggest that the glucose levels do not affect the affinity of mig <dig> for the importin-α and β.
4c and
4d was determined by western blot using anti-kap <dig> and anti-kap <dig> antibodies respectively. the western blots shown are representative of results obtained from four independent experiments.

to confirm the in vitro interaction of mig <dig> with kap <dig> and kap <dig>  we also performed a gst pull-down assay. we used crude protein extracts from a wild-type strain and a gst-mig <dig> fusion protein expressed in e. coli. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  a clear retention of kap <dig> protein  and kap <dig>  was observed both in high and low-glucose conditions. when a control with gst protein in the reaction mix was used, no kap <dig> or kap <dig> signal was observed. these results also confirm that the interaction between mig <dig> and both importins is similar under high and low-glucose conditions and suggest that both proteins interact in a glucose independent manner.

to analyse the interaction of mig2nls <dig> mutant protein with kap <dig> and kap <dig>  we also performed a gst pull-down assay. we used crude protein extracts from a wild-type strain and purified gst-mig2nls <dig> fusion protein expressed in e. coli. as shown in figure 
5a, a clear retention of kap <dig> protein was observed both in high and low-glucose conditions in the sample containing gst-mig2nls <dig> and crude extract from the wild-type strain. however, a very weak or no retention of kap <dig> protein was observed for the sample containing gst-mig2nls <dig> and crude extract from the wild-type strain . together, these data suggest that the mig2-kap <dig> interaction strongly depends on the nls <dig> motif, whereas the latter has no influence on the interaction with kap <dig> 
5a and
5b was determined by western blot using anti-kap <dig> and anti-kap <dig> antibodies respectively. the western blots shown are representative of results obtained from four independent experiments.

the interaction between kap <dig> and mig <dig> requires auxiliary factors other than kap <dig> protein
as indicated above, kap <dig> is required for efficient nuclear import of mig <dig>  in order to address the question of if this function is direct or indirect, we determined if kap <dig> is needed to mediate the interaction with mig <dig>  for this purpose, again purified proteins from e. coli were employed. we used gst-mig <dig>  gst-mig2nls <dig>  gst-kap <dig> and gst-kap <dig> fusion proteins. the gst fusion proteins were immobilized with glutathione-sepharose and released with thrombin. first, we immobilized gst-mig <dig> on glutathione-sepharose beads and analysed the binding of purified kap <dig> and kap <dig> proteins. our results confirmed that purified kap <dig> has a strong affinity for mig <dig>  and that this interaction was not nls1-dependent . however, no interaction of mig <dig> or mig2nls <dig> with kap <dig> was detected using purified proteins either in the presence or absence of kap <dig> .
5c was determined by western blot using anti-kap <dig> antibodies. the western blots shown are representative of results obtained from four independent experiments.

these results indicate that auxiliary factors other than kap <dig> protein are required for the mig2-kap <dig> interaction. in order to investigate if the gsp1-gtp/gdp cycle controls the formation and/or the transport direction of the mig2-kap <dig> complex
 <cit> , we tried to reconstruct the import complex in vitro using purified proteins. to study how the different factors affect the mig2-kap <dig> interaction affinity, we performed gst pull-down experiments with purified proteins. we used gst-mig <dig>  gst-gsp <dig> and gst-kap <dig> fusion proteins from e. coli lysates. the gst fusion proteins were immobilized with glutathione-sepharose and released with thrombin. first, we immobilized gst-mig <dig> on glutathione-sepharose beads and analysed the binding of kap <dig>  our results indicate that purified kap <dig> has no affinity for mig <dig> . however, as expected for an importin-type receptor, the complex formation between kap <dig> and mig <dig> is regulated by the guanine nucleotide-binding protein gsp <dig>  our data indicate that the mig2-kap <dig> complex is not formed in the presence or absence of gsp1-gtp . however, the presence of gsp1-gdp facilitates the formation and increases the stability of the mig2-kap <dig> complex .

this experiment suggests that a ternary complex between kap <dig>  gsp <dig> and mig <dig> is formed in vitro. moreover, the complex formation is controlled by the gdp/gtp-bound state of gsp <dig>  because loading of gsp <dig> with gtp disrupts the formation of the import complex and gsp <dig> loaded with gdp acts as an auxiliary factor required for mig2-kap <dig> interaction and for complex stabilization.

discussion
glucose levels regulate mig <dig> translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria
 <cit> . in high-glucose conditions, nuclear mig <dig> interacts with mig <dig> and hxk <dig> to participate in the suc2-mig <dig> repressor complex. in low glucose conditions, mig <dig> s <dig> is phosphorylated by snf <dig> kinase
 <cit> . once phosphorylated mig <dig> leaves the nucleus
 <cit> . nuclear hxk <dig> loses its anchoring protein and also moves into the cytosol
 <cit> . this process leads to suc <dig> repressor complex dissociation and suc <dig> gene derepression. in these conditions, the vast majority of mig <dig> accumulates in the mitochondria. the mitochondrial targeting of mig <dig> in low glucose conditions is ups1-dependent
 <cit> . while it is essential for mig <dig> to enter the nucleus to perform its role as transcriptional repressor, the mechanism by which the protein transverses the nuclear envelope has not been investigated until now. in the current study, we have extended our knowledge of the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of mig <dig> by showing that its nuclear translocation is mediated by the importin-β  and regulated by the ran gtpase protein .

in this study, we provide evidence that nuclear import of mig <dig> is independent of the yeast msn <dig> karyopherin and that kap <dig> is the carrier responsible for the nuclear accumulation of mig <dig> under high-glucose conditions. we observe that mig <dig> protein in kap95ts mutant cells is not efficiently imported into the nucleus and accumulates in the mitochondrial tubules during high-glucose growth. however, in kap60ts mutant cells mig <dig> is efficiently imported into the nucleus in high-glucose conditions. these data suggest that kap <dig> is the karyopherin responsible for nuclear import of the mig <dig> protein, either independently or as part of a larger complex from which kap <dig> is excluded.

taken together, our results demonstrate that the lys <dig>  lys <dig> and/or arg <dig> are critical amino acid residues in the mig <dig> nls <dig> sequence. moreover, since the nls <dig> mutation does not affect mig <dig> import because it does not decrease significantly its nuclear accumulation and glucose repression signalling, our data suggest that only the nls <dig> motif is necessary for efficient nuclear import of mig2-gfp in vivo. these results are surprising because it has not been previously described that kap <dig> directly recognizes a conventional nls. however, the results are consistent with the idea that only kap <dig> protein participates in mig <dig> nuclear import. moreover, the mig2nls <dig> mutant protein lacks repressor function, while, the mig2nls <dig> mutant protein complements the Δmig <dig> mutation in a double Δmig1Δmig <dig> mutant and exhibits predominantly nuclear localization. our pull-down assays employing purified proteins suggest, that the mig2-kap <dig> complex is stable and does not require kap <dig> for association in the presence of gsp <dig>  as happens in the cytoplasm. however, in the nucleus the complex is disrupted in the presence of high levels of gsp <dig>  thus, efficient dissociation of the mig2-kap <dig> complex is mediated primarily by gsp <dig> which displaces mig <dig> from the importin-β receptor. these experiments, also exclude the possibility that some unknown protein/s in the yeast extract could mediate the interaction between the mig <dig> protein and the kap <dig> protein.

importin-β  has two distinct mechanisms by which it associates with transport substrates: indirect and direct. the more conventional import pathway takes place by the indirect association of cargo with the kap60-kap <dig>  complex. while kap <dig> binds to a classical nls present in the cargo, kap <dig> associates with kap <dig> and is primarily responsible for translocation of the complex across the nuclear pore. conversely, direct association involves kap <dig> directly binding to its cargo. several examples of this direct mechanism have been described in mammalian cells
 <cit> , implying that the importin-β  may be able to function independently of kap <dig> as a nuclear import receptor. the findings of the present study not only establish that mig <dig> is similar to the above mammalian proteins in being recognized by kap <dig> alone but also demonstrate conclusively for the first time in yeast that kap <dig>  in concert with gsp <dig>  is sufficient to mediate nuclear import of mig <dig> in the absence of kap <dig>  the mig <dig> protein has been shown to bind directly to kap <dig> in the presence of gsp <dig> without requiring kap <dig> for association. thus, our results are in accordance with previous publications describing kap <dig> as an essential karyopherin in the nuclear import of several proteins without requiring importin-α
 <cit> .

although the details are not fully understood, there are novel nls-dependent nuclear import pathways exclusively mediated by kap <dig> that are presumably analogous to those mediated by other importin-β homologs. the kap <dig> protein has been described as contributing to the nuclear import of cargos by recognizing import signals different from the classical nls
 <cit> . surprisingly, a classical nls-mediated transport mechanism is required for mig2-kap <dig> binding and mig <dig> nuclear accumulation in the absence of a functional kap <dig> protein.

our results also indicate that kap <dig> interacts with mig2-gfp both in high and low-glucose conditions as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation and gst-pull down experiments. however, this interaction is not required for mig2-gfp nuclear import. moreover, the nls <dig> sequence of mig <dig> is not involved in the kap60-mig <dig> interaction. thus, the physiological significance of mig2-kap <dig> is unknown at the current stage. while a number of nuclear import pathways have been identified, the definition of general rules of what constitutes the targeting signal and the role of kap <dig> has only been possible for the classical nuclear import pathway. for other pathways, such rules have not yet been identified probably because an insufficient number of cargos are known, the recognition of cargo by the carrier requires further characterization by structural and interaction analyses or no common rules exist and the recognition is specific to specific cargos. the key to progress is to integrate seemingly disparate types of information, using structural, and sequence information and protein-protein interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
the current study has identified a new pathway for mig <dig> import into the nucleus. here we provide data that support a model for mig <dig> nuclear import that includes kap <dig> as the predominant karyopherin and the nls <dig> of mig <dig> as essential for efficient mig2-kap <dig> interaction and nuclear import. mig <dig>  in the presence of gsp <dig>  directly binds importin-β , and together they form a complex to allow the passage of mig <dig> through the nuclear pore. thus, we found that kap <dig> forms a stable complex with mig <dig> in the cytoplasm where the level of gsp <dig> is high. after translocation into the nucleus, where the gsp <dig> level is low and the gsp <dig> level is high, this complex is dissociated via a mechanism that includes gdp/gtp exchange in the import complex.
