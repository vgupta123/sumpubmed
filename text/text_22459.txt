BACKGROUND
novel high-throughput dna sequencing technologies have allowed the generation of millions of short reads and have empowered a wide variety of studies such as genome-wide analysis of transcriptomes   <cit> , transcription factor binding sites   <cit>  and whole-genome sequencing and analysis  <cit> . however, these studies have often been limited by a high cost per sample and low throughput. a typical sequencing run on an illumina genome analyzer ii currently costs about $ <dig> in reagents per flowcell lane and requires ~ <dig> days to complete both the sequencing and illumina analysis pipeline phases. moreover, the number of mapped reads  is often significantly higher than required for the experiment, especially for organisms of small genome sizes such as yeasts, worms and flies.

multiplex dna sequencing has been pursued since the beginning of sanger sequencing  <cit>  and has been applied to roche's  <dig> platform  <cit> . here we describe a multiplexing strategy for illumina sequencing to process multiple dna samples simultaneously. the strategy was applied to analyze the targets of three yeast dna binding proteins  using chromatin immunoprecipitation  and was shown to yield accurate and high quality results. we also included a reference sample for chip-seq termed input dna.

chip followed by high-throughput sequencing  has been developed to map the protein-dna interactions at a genome-wide level  <cit> . it allows characterization of transcription factor binding and other dna-binding proteins during development  <cit> , under different environmental conditions  <cit>  or in different cell types or tissues. chip-seq has also been used to study the epigenome by mapping the distribution of histone modifications and chromatin-modifying complexes  <cit> . combination of multiple chip-seq experiments can help to determine transcriptional networks  <cit> .

cse <dig> is a centromeric variant of histone h <dig>  <cit>  and its human homolog is the centromeric protein a   <cit> . yeast centromeres span  <dig> base pairs and are divided in three centromeric dna elements ; cse <dig> binds cdeii  <cit> . cse <dig> participates in the formation of a specialized hexameric nucleosome with histone h <dig> and scm <dig> that diverges from the standard h2a-h2b-h3-h <dig> octamer  <cit> . the kinetochore assembles at the centromere and cse <dig> is required for normal kinetochore assembly and function  <cit> . cse <dig> mutants display strong chromosome missegregation due to incorrect kinetochore structure  <cit> .

ste <dig> is a transcription factor that regulates two sets of genes: those involved in invasive growth  and those implicated in the mating response   <cit> . pseudohyphal growth is a polarized invasion of media by s. cerevisiae upon nitrogen starvation. it integrates signals from a map kinase cascade and the camp-dependant pathway  <cit> . during pseudohyphal growth, ste <dig> associates as a dimer with tec <dig> on transcription factor binding sites  upstream of invasive genes  <cit> . during the mating response, tec <dig> is phosphorylated by fus <dig> upon pheromone stimulation, leading to its degradation and the binding of ste <dig> on the pheromone response elements  <cit> . thus, the dual role of ste <dig> depends mainly on different phosphorylation events  <cit> .

rna polymerase ii  transcribes most protein-coding genes and is conserved among metazoans. it is recruited to a particular transcription start site depending on the chromatin structure and the presence of preinitiation complexes and transcription factors. in budding yeast, the polii holoenzyme consists of  <dig> subunits   <cit> . rpb <dig>  rpb <dig>  rpb <dig>  rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> are shared with the two other major rna polymerases and rpb <dig> contacts dna to promote transcriptional activation  <cit> . polii directly interacts with the mediator complex, histones, transcription factors, elongation factors and many other proteins  <cit> . although yeast rna polymerase iii genome-wide distribution has been studied extensively using microarrays  <cit> , only one similar study has been performed to characterize polii distribution across the yeast genome  <cit> .

using multiplex chip-seq, we mapped the targets of cse <dig>  ste <dig> and polii across the yeast genome. we found a large number of binding sites for each factor. cse <dig> localized predominantly to centromeres and we also observed other cse <dig> binding sites with lower signal intensity elsewhere in the genome. ste <dig> and polii binding sites were found in close proximity to genes.

RESULTS
the barcoded chip-seq workflow is illustrated in figure  <dig>  we first generated standard illumina genomic dna adapter sequences augmented with one of four barcodes . the first three bases uniquely tag or "barcode" a given sample preparation and are separated by a hamming distance  <cit>  of three which will prevent one barcode being miscalled as another barcode when allowing for one- or two-base sequencing errors. the final 't' at the fourth base anneals with the 'a' overhang from the end-repaired dna sample for ligation of chip or other dna fragments. illumina pcr primers for genomic dna are used without any changes after adapter ligation to generate the sequencing libraries. four libraries are pooled together in equimolar ratios and sequenced in a single lane. after sequencing, four distinct sequencing profiles are obtained by parsing the barcodes into distinct bins for subsequent analyses.

similar barcode behavior with the same dna sample
to first test whether barcodes generate similar results when added to the same population of dna fragments, we divided an input dna sample into five aliquots. the input sample consists of saccharomyces cerevisiae dna prepared from crosslinked and sonicated chromatin without immunoprecipation and it represents breaks at open chromatin regions . four of the samples were differentially barcoded and the libraries were mixed together in the same flowcell lane. as a control, standard non-barcoded illumina genomic dna adapters were added to the fifth aliquot and this library was sequenced in another lane. after sorting reads by barcodes, the barcode sequences were stripped and  <dig> base pairs were aligned back to the yeast genome. similar numbers of reads were obtained for each barcoded library. as shown in figure  <dig>  signal tracks are very similar for the five aliquots. the normalized average tag counts in  <dig> bp windows are also highly comparable among aliquots . the results for each barcoded library were scored against the control without a barcode to find significant differences; only  <dig>  out of  <dig> , <dig> unique bps  from the s. cerevisiae genome differ significantly for all four barcoded libraries . in addition, comparison of peaks among the different libraries revealed high degrees of similarity. these characteristics highly resemble those of a non-barcoded input library analyzed in two different sequencing reactions. thus, overall biases are not observed in efficiencies of various barcoded libraries and barcoding does not appear to induce differences relative to non-barcoded libraries.

correlation coefficients on the average tag count in  <dig> bp bins between two experiments among barcoded and non-barcoded input dna samples from the section "similar barcode behavior with the same dna sample" , among barcoded and non-barcoded polii replicates  and among barcoded and non-barcoded ste <dig> replicates . p-values are inferior to  <dig> e- <dig>  the lowest p-value that r can calculate. see methods for details of the analysis.

experimental design for multiplex yeast chip-seq
we next analyzed the distributions of three diverse dna-binding proteins across the yeast s. cerevisiae genome using three to four biological replicates per factor. this study allowed us to 1) further examine the reproducibility of a specified barcode using a different biological replicate 2) determine whether there was crossover signal between barcodes and 3) use the technique to map the binding distributions of three dna-binding proteins. the proteins selected were the centromeric histone h <dig> variant cse <dig>  <cit> , rna polii  and the transcription factor ste <dig>  <cit>  . cse <dig> is expected to have a very distinct binding distribution from that of ste <dig> which binds near promoters. we also included input dna as a reference for chip-seq as a fourth sample. initially we compared three biological replicates for each factor using barcoded sequences for two of the replicates and non-barcoded sequences for the third one. each biological replicate was made into its own dna library. the barcoded libraries were pooled and sequenced with one pool per lane  whereas the non-barcoded libraries were sequenced in individual lanes. two lanes were run using the barcoded adapters: pol ii-acgt, input-catt, cse4-gtat and ste12-tgct  and input-acgt, cse4-catt, ste12-gtat and polii-tgct . to compare reproducibility of alternative barcodes relative to reproducibility between biological replicates, we sequenced another replicate of pol ii chip dna in a separate pool using the same barcode as one of the other replicates  . after sorting reads by barcodes, the barcodes were stripped and  <dig> base pairs were aligned to the yeast genome. we scored chip samples against  <dig> million input reads derived equally from barcoded and non-barcoded input dna. rank-order comparisons between the top targets for two different biological replicates were performed to assess similarity. we obtained  <dig> targets for cse <dig>   <dig> targets for ste <dig> and  <dig> targets for polii .

comparison of polii biological replicates
by comparing two biological replicates of polii chip dna with the same barcode  we found a close correlation between the target lists . a similar close correlation was observed by comparing the targets of the individual biological replicates using different barcodes among each of the different factors . furthermore, comparison of normalized average tag counts in  <dig> bp windows between biological replicates for polii and ste <dig> revealed strong correlations . these values are similar to the correlation coefficients between biological replicates found in a recent yeast rna-seq study   <cit> . thus, consistent with barcoded input dna, the different barcodes give similar results when analyzing similar libraries. our results strongly suggest that the barcode has negligible impact on binding site detection.

comparison of chip-seq data to previously published chip-chip data
we also compared the binding site distributions for ste <dig>  cse <dig> and polii to previously published data  <cit> . our ste <dig> chip-seq targets overlap with 67%  of the targets found in borneman et al.  <cit>  while our polii chip-seq targets overlap with 72%  of the polii chip-chip targets from the steinmetz et al. data  <cit> . these overlaps between chip-seq and chip-chip do not differ significantly from those determined in other studies  <cit> , typically in the 64–71% range. however, we observe 2- to 4-fold more targets using chip-seq as compared to chip-chip, consistent with the observation that chip-seq is more sensitive than chip-chip  <cit> .

non-overlapping binding profiles among samples sequenced simultaneously
by comparing binding profiles obtained from a single lane containing four different barcoded libraries, we observed that many targets belong uniquely to a single signal track and their distributions are consistent with the biological roles of the factors studied . this is particularly the case for ste <dig> and cse <dig> which have highly dissimilar binding patterns and almost no target overlap . note that some peaks are present in both chip and input samples and are removed after scoring. thus, analysis of different chip samples with distinct barcodes indicates that the signal from one barcoded library does not crossover to those of other barcoded libraries . we define signal crossover as the erroneous assignment of a barcoded read from a particular chip sample to the wrong chip sample during multiplex chip-seq, generating a signal profile for one barcoded sample with reads from other chips sequenced simultaneously.

ste <dig>  polii and cse <dig> binding distributions
analysis of the binding targets of ste <dig>  pol ii and cse <dig> reveals expected and novel results. ste12p binds upstream of genes implicated in pseudohyphal growth such as tec <dig>  mga <dig>  phd <dig> and flo <dig> . as expected, ste <dig> targets are enriched for go categories including pseudohyphal growth, cell wall organization, and stress response , which is consistent with the role of ste12p in regulating the pseudohyphal pathway. the polii distribution in mid-log phase intersects ~ <dig> genes, which is fewer than that reported by recent rna-seq studies  <cit> . this may be due to differences in the analysis of chip-seq and rna-seq data. enriched regions in chip-seq data are determined using a threshold for a minimal read count difference at a particular region between the chip sample and input dna while rna-seq data is analyzed using a global threshold for a minimal number of mapped reads. overall, we recapitulated all the binding profiles displayed in the genome-wide polii chip-chip study by steinmetz et al.   <cit> . as expected, polii targets are overrepresented in go categories such as translation, transcription, rna processing and primary metabolism, which are crucial for exponential growth in rich media . cse4p binds strongly to all yeast  <dig> centromeres as shown previously . our data indicate that cse <dig> tightly occupies a narrow region around the centromere. in addition, we also detected significant binding relative to background at  <dig> novel non-centromeric sites; cse4p is less abundant at these sites relative to centromeric regions . these non-centromeric sites are enriched for metabolic genes, in particular those involved in glucose metabolism , which are highly expressed under our conditions . in addition, nearly all non-centromeric cse <dig> target genes are present among the  <dig> highest ranked polii targets. to explain this novel finding, we hypothesize that cse <dig> transiently integrates at regions of high histone turnover which could now be detected using chip-seq. cse4p might temporarily integrate at these non-centromeric sites before being outcompeted by histone h <dig> since it has been demonstrated by chip-qpcr that a cse <dig> mutant protein can localize to non-centromeric locations when the stoichiometry between histone h <dig> and cse4p is perturbed  <cit> .

artifacts absent in barcoded libraries but present in non-barcoded libraries
finally, we did observe one set of differences between barcoded and non-barcoded libraries. a curious rare artifact was found in non-barcoded libraries and excluded in barcoded libraries. ~ <dig> abnormally-shaped peaks were present in non-barcoded chip libraries in which the same sequences was obtained many times resulting in block-shaped peaks . this artifact was not observed in barcoded libraries.

although the source of this artifact is not clear, it might be due to specific priming from the non-barcoded adaptor on yeast dna. regardless, these artifacts are readily eliminated by removing non-unique reads. we did not find additional areas of dissimilarity between barcoded and non-barcoded libraries.

CONCLUSIONS
our multiplex strategy for chip-seq allows reliable and accurate analysis of multiple samples simultaneously. we processed four times as many samples in the same amount of time and reduced our cost per sample by 65% . barcoded chip-seq will greatly facilitate large-scale studies in organisms with large genomes for which smaller numbers of reads are required and will be particularly valuable for organisms with small genomes such as bacteria, viruses, other yeasts, algae such as chlamydomonas reinhardtii and plants such as a. thaliana. the relatively small genomes of two model organisms, the worm c. elegans and the fruit fly d. melanogaster, are under intensive characterization by the modencode consortium  <cit> . modencode  aims to identify all functional elements, including transcription factor binding sites and transcribed regions, in the genomes of c. elegans and d. melanogaster. thus the application of barcoded chip-seq to globally map transcription factor binding sites in c. elegans and d. melanogaster will be valuable for cost-effective completion of this project. we estimate for yeast that we would need  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mapped reads to saturate transcription factor binding sites, given fold-enrichments of 5×, 10× and 50× respectively . with an enrichment of 10-fold,  <dig>  mapped reads would be needed for c. elegans,  <dig> , <dig> reads for d. melanogaster and  <dig> , <dig> reads for a. thaliana . these numbers can be easily achieved with barcoded chip-seq. moreover, considering the high degree of chip-seq target overlap between different biological replicates , we estimate that two biological replicates are sufficient to achieve statistical significance for a particular chip-seq experiment if the biological replicates are very similar. otherwise, three biological replicates should be used if there is a higher level of divergence among different biological replicates.

our general multiplexing approach is expected to be useful for a variety of other applications including bacterial genome re-sequencing and rna-seq; it will also be valuable for other short read dna sequencing platforms. using the current technology, genome re-sequencing in yeasts, with a 25× coverage for snp detection, is not amenable to multiplexing as it would require about  <dig>  m mapped reads of length  <dig> . this is equivalent to one or two illumina flowcell lanes. rna-seq experiments could also be multiplexed in the future although considerable sequencing depth is required to detect at a significant level low-abundance transcripts or rare splice variants. in general, to detect binding sites or transcripts that are present in low abundance by barcoded chip-seq or rna-seq, it is important to determine by calculations or computer simulations the minimal number of mapped reads per sample to establish the appropriate level of multiplexing. with the new illumina genome analyzer ii, there is an increase in the number of reads that can be obtained  and it will be possible to further multiplex chip-seq by creating many other different barcoded adapters, ligating them to individual samples and pooling all of these barcoded libraries in the same flow cell lane. sequencing reagent costs per sample would further decrease from 65%  to 76% , 80% , 82%  and 85% , in comparison to non-barcoded samples .

to maintain base balance at any given sequencing cycle, indexing adapters should be designed in increments of four. we prefer to keep the barcodes distinct from one another to avoid crossover due to sequencing errors; for a 3-base barcode this leads to  <dig> different combinations. to increase multiplexing beyond this figure one can either use barcodes with one base difference and correct for sequencing errors or increase the size of the barcode. massively barcoded chip-seq, bearing constant improvements in ultra-throughput sequencing technologies, will become widely accessible and is expected to supplant array-based technologies for gene regulation and expression studies in organisms with both small and larger genomes.
