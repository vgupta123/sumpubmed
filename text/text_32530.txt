BACKGROUND
recent genome-wide studies have revealed far more extensive transcription of mammalian genomes than previously recognized  <cit> . one consequence of this pervasive transcription is the occurrence of widespread bidirectional transcription that results in overlapping transcripts antisense to most known mrnas  <cit> . such antisense transcription takes several forms. both long and short non-coding antisense transcripts have been described overlapping either the 5' or 3' ends of mrnas. in other instances two mrnas encoded on opposite strands share such an overlap. although regulatory implications of antisense transcription are unclear, many studies suggest that the mechanisms associated with expression of antisense rna in eukaryotes are remarkably diverse and mechanistically complex  <cit> .

one of the first examples of an antisense overlap between two mrnas involves two nuclear receptor genes, the α-type thyroid hormone receptor gene  and the rev-erbα gene   <cit> . these genes share an antisense overlap that reflects the presence of a novel alternatively spliced mrna that is highly conserved in most mammals but is absent in non-mammalian vertebrates  <cit> . alternative processing of trα pre-mrnas yields two functionally distinct proteins. one is the canonical thyroid hormone  receptor, trα <dig>  that activates target genes in a thyroid hormone -dependent manner. the other, trα <dig>  has a novel c-terminal sequence encoded by an exon antisense to rev-erbα. trα <dig> mrna lacks both the hormone-binding domain and a critical activation domain present in trα <dig> and may function as a weak dominant negative repressor, repressing expression of genes activated by trα <dig> in the presence of t <dig>  <cit> . rev-erbα has a dna-binding specificity distinct from trα <dig> and trα <dig>  like trα <dig>  rev-erbα possesses a canonical ligand binding domain but, like trα <dig>  it lacks the af- <dig> activation domain. thus, both rev-erbα and trα <dig> are constitutive repressors, although they bind distinct sets of target genes.

trα <dig> and rev-erbα play important roles in metabolic and developmental regulation  <cit> . trα <dig> mediates t <dig> activity critical for vertebrate development and homeostatic metabolism. rev-erbα plays critical roles in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism, while occupying a specific node in the mammalian circadian clock  <cit> . while previously considered a ligandless orphan receptor, rev-erbα has recently been shown to bind heme specifically within its canonical ligand binding domain   <cit> . interactions of rev-erbα with its co-repressors are enhanced in the presence of heme and, with heme bound, may respond to physiological regulators such as nitric oxide  <cit> . thus, rev-erbα has emerged as an important integrator of inputs from multiple physiologic pathways  <cit> .

the overlap architecture of the region encoding trα and rev-erbα  and the physiological importance of these nuclear receptors raise important questions relating to the function, evolution and regulation of this locus. the evolutionary constraints imposed on such a bidirectional coding sequence argue that it is highly unlikely that such an overlap would occur without some functional benefit. several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that expression of rev-erbα mrna may affect the balance between trα <dig> and trα <dig> through inhibition of trα <dig> splicing  <cit> ; however, such an interaction has not been demonstrated under physiological conditions.

in this study we first analyze the structure of the trα/rev-erbα locus in monodelphis domestica, the gray short-tailed opossum, the first published marsupial genome  <cit> , and compare it with that of other marsupials. individually, trα and rev-erbα genes and transcripts are highly conserved in the opossum in comparison with those of eutherian mammals. however, the region corresponding to the rev-erbα/trα <dig> overlap in eutherian mammals displays several divergent features. most of the c-terminal coding sequence unique to trα <dig> is missing in m. domestica due to the introduction of an in-frame stop codon that eliminates the bidirectional coding overlap with rev-erbα. furthermore, expression of trα <dig> mrna was not detected in the opossum in any of a variety of tissues or developmental stages. these results are surprising given the remarkable conservation of trα <dig> and its abundant and developmentally regulated expression in eutherian mammals. analysis of chimeric minigenes comprised of opossum and rat sequences demonstrated that opossum sequences homologous to the trα2-specific splice site  are very poorly utilized in comparison with similar rat minigenes. these studies thus document the evolution of a novel alternatively spliced exon in mammals and the creation of antisense overlap between two important regulatory proteins.

RESULTS
structures of eutherian trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas are conserved in marsupials
inspection of the genome of monodelphis domestica  <cit>  reveals a single locus on chromosome  <dig> in which the trα and rev-erbα genes are arrayed in a convergent orientation similar to that in rat and other mammalian genomes . the coding regions for trα <dig>  and rev-erbα are separated by only  <dig>  kb, similar to the close spacing of the coding regions in the rat genome . furthermore, the non-coding sequence extending across and between the 3' ends of these genes is also very well conserved . the most striking conservation is located at the extreme 3' end of trα <dig> mrna, in which a sequence of  <dig> bp is almost identical to that in the rat and other eutherian mammals. the region surrounding the 3' end of rev-erbα is also highly conserved and is flanked upstream and downstream by homopolymeric runs of  <dig> or more c  and g  residues, respectively, as is the case in other mammals .

closer inspection of the sequence for m. domestica trα, however, reveals that the first coding exon of trα <dig> mrna is entirely missing in the genome assembly due to a  <dig> kb gap  <cit> . also, apparent sequencing errors at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of exon  <dig> disrupt the reading frame for trα <dig> by introducing, respectively, a one-base insertion and a stop codon. the complete coding sequence for m. domestica trα <dig> was obtained by sequencing cdna using primers complementary to conserved sequences in the 5' utr and at intervals throughout the coding sequence. the trα <dig> coding sequence for m. domestica from this analysis was identical in all other respects to the current genome assembly . as shown in figure  <dig> the amino acid sequence of opossum trα <dig> is closely similar to that of rat, with 93% identity at the amino acid level. rev-erbα is also well conserved with 84% identity. the 3' ends of trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas from opossum were mapped via rnase protection assays and 3' race, respectively , and were found to coincide precisely with the sites previously reported for rat  <cit>  as indicated in additional file  <dig>  to confirm these observations, mrna sequences for trα <dig> and rev-erbα were determined for a second marsupial, potorous tridactylus . the opossum and potoroo amino acid sequences, representing the two largest marsupial orders, didelphia and diprotodontia, about  <dig> my diverged  <cit> , are very similar: 99% and 96% identity for trα <dig> and rev-erbα, respectively .

in contrast to the strong conservation of trα <dig> and rev-erbα, sequences corresponding to the alternatively spliced exon  <dig> of trα <dig> mrna display a puzzling mix of conserved and non-conserved features. sequences corresponding to the core 3'ss elements for this exon are nearly identical in rat and m. domestica, including the intronic polypyrimidine tract and the non-consensus aag immediately preceding the 3'ss . sequence at the 5' end of exon  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig> codons in rat trα <dig>  is also well conserved but at that point the similarity between marsupial and eutherian sequence ends abruptly until reaching the coding sequence for rev-erbα. the divergent region includes a  <dig> nucleotide insertion in opossum and an in-frame stop codon immediately preceding the stop codon for rev-erbα on the strand antisense to trα. these adjacent stop codons, present in both species of opossum but absent in wallaby and potoroo, as described below, precisely eliminate the bidirectional coding overlap between trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas seen in rat and other eutherian mammals  <cit> . finally, the rev-erbα amino acid sequence encoded by its terminal exon is identical in opossum and rat. however, there are  <dig> synonymous substitutions in rev-erbα sequence, almost all of which alter the coding potential of the trα strand in opossum.

to further explore the significance of this sequence comparison, we examined  <dig>  kb of genomic sequence that span the 3' end of trα <dig> and extend across exon  <dig> and part of exon  <dig> of rev-erbα in three other marsupial species: didelphis virginiana , p. tridactylus, and macropus eugenii . alignment of all four marsupial sequences with those of rat shows a high level of conservation of marsupial features similar to that shown in figure 1b and additional file  <dig>  as expected, since both are of the order didelphimorphia, the sequence of the opossum d. virginiana is very similar to that of m. domestica . both include a 12-nucleotide insertion and in-frame stop codon in the region adjacent to the stop codon for rev-erbα . sequences for wallaby and potoroo  are similar to those from the opossums in the region homologous to exon  <dig> of trα <dig>  furthermore, the amino acid sequences encoded by the 3' exon of rev-erbα in all four marsupials are identical to that of rat except for a single residue change in the potoroo, although each sequence contains many substitutions which are silent with respect to rev-erbα .

despite their high degree of similarity overall, the potoroo and wallaby sequences differ from those of the opossums in one notable respect: there is a two-basepair deletion immediately downstream of sequences homologous to the 3'ss of exon  <dig> in trα <dig> mrna. this deletion disrupts the reading frame corresponding to the c-terminus of trα <dig> and creates a novel open reading frame that extends past the rev-erbα stop codon, overlapping the rev-erbα coding region by  <dig> codons .

expression of trα and rev-erbα mrnas in marsupials
given the conservation of so many features within the trα/rev-erbα locus in marsupials, it seemed likely that marsupials might express an alternatively spliced mrna yielding a truncated version of trα <dig>  to characterize expression of mrnas from rev-erbα and trα genes we examined rna from multiple tissues from m. domestica at six different ages ranging from newborn animals  to weanlings  and young adults .

expression of both trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas was readily detected at all stages by rt-pcr. since newborn and one-week animals are only  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm in length, respectively, these animals were simply divided into two parts, heads and bodies, for extraction of rna. beginning with two-week animals, six different tissues were collected: cerebral cortex, cerebellum, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and heart. for each tissue at each stage, both trα <dig> and rev-erbα expression were readily detected by realtime rt-pcr and expression of both mrnas was confirmed by sequencing pcr amplification products. results of these assays are summarized in figure 3a for heads and bodies of newborn , and cerebral cortex and livers of older animals . similar results are shown for four other tissues in additional file  <dig>  increasing expression of rev-erbα correlates strongly with increasing age . the highest levels of rev-erbα expression were observed in liver and skeletal muscle; the lowest levels were in heart. in all tissues except liver rev-erbα showed a large, 4- to 6-fold increase in expression between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks . in fact, trα <dig> expression also showed a strong, if less pronounced, correlation with increasing age in all tissues except heart  .

in contrast to trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrna expression, both realtime and conventional rt-pcr assays for trα <dig> were consistently negative. to confirm this result, multiple pairs of primers were tested, including forward primers in exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and reverse primers annealing to different sites within the region homologous to trα <dig> exon  <dig> and rev-erbα exon  <dig>  while the threshold values obtained for trα <dig> were highly reproducible, typically varying by < <dig>  cycles for a given set of replicas, replica samples run with primers for trα <dig> were highly variable, either displaying large threshold values or altogether failing to cross the threshold. melt-curves  and gel electrophoresis of these products revealed a heterogeneous array of non-specific products, as illustrated in the replica lanes shown in figure 3d. additional file  <dig> summarizes threshold values from realtime rt-pcr for trα <dig> across all tissues and ages  and shows parallel values for trα <dig> for comparison. two different downstream primers for trα <dig> were used for most of these assays. in none of the assays was a product obtained consistent with splicing of trα <dig> mrna in opossum.

to test the efficiency and sensitivity of the trα <dig> primers, realtime rt-pcr was carried out with a short synthetic dna template matching the predicted amplicon sequence of opossum trα <dig> mrna. serial dilutions of this template were assayed in the presence of a fixed amount of a negative cdna preparation of m. domestica total rna from cerebral cortex. the plot in figure 3e indicates that these trα2-specific primers have a high efficiency, >99%  <cit> , and a sensitivity at ct =  <dig> of less than  <dig> copies of trα <dig> cdna.

expression of trα and rev-erbα mrnas was also measured by rnase protection assays on total rna from the head  or cerebral cortex  as shown in figure 3b. from the specific activity of the probe, the level of trα <dig> mrna was determined to vary between  <dig>  and  <dig>  amol/μg rna  with no clear stage-specific trend. on the other hand, rev-erbα increased steadily from less than  <dig>  amol/μg rna in day  <dig> animals to about  <dig>  amol/ug rna in  <dig> week animals , a trend paralleling the increase observed by realtime rt-pcr in cerebral cortex and several other tissues . trα <dig> expression was assayed with a probe that extended across the 3' and 5' splice sites for exon 9a. the length of the protected fragment for trα <dig> reveals efficient splicing of the former but not the latter site. in older opossums  a faint band corresponding in size to that expected for use of the 5'ss of trα <dig> was observed. the presence of this band raises the possibility that an alternatively spliced product with a similar 5'ss to trα <dig> is expressed in older animals. however, further efforts to identify such a product were unsuccessful.

requirements for splicing of trα2
although we found no evidence of trα <dig> expression in m. domestica, the possibility remained that its expression is tightly restricted to some tissue, developmental stage or particular set of physiological conditions. to examine the intrinsic competency for splicing of conserved sequences corresponding to the 3'ss of exon  <dig> of trα <dig>  an opossum minigene was constructed based on the structure of a rat minigene that efficiently expressed trα <dig> mrna in transfection assays  <cit> . the construct consisted of exons 7- <dig> of trα, extending downstream to exon  <dig> of rev-erbα, with all the intron sequences except for a large deletion within intron  <dig> that eliminated the competing trα <dig> polyadenylation site and much of the preceding 3' utr . this minigene was efficiently expressed in transient transfection assays in hek  <dig> cells. rna processing was assayed for both spliced  and partially spliced  rna by conventional pcr  and realtime rt-pcr , as well as rnase protection assays . bands corresponding to spliced trα <dig> were evident for the rat minigene  in all three assays. real-time pcr and rnase protection assays yielded quantitative measures of trα <dig> splicing relative to unspliced trα <dig> of 64-77%, consistent with earlier results for this minigene construct. conventional pcr employing larger amplicons reveals a minor amount of a second spliced product corresponding to the minor spliced isoform, trα <dig> . in contrast, no spliced product could be detected from the opossum minigene . the larger band evident in figure 4b  corresponds to readthrough sequence, while the heterogeneous bands in figure 4c represent non-specific amplification products observed after  <dig> cycles of amplification. close examination of the rnase protection assays  revealed no bands corresponding to splicing of exon 9a. figure 4e summarizes the results of each of the assays. a low level of residual background activity was routinely detected with rnase protection assays and real-time pcr yielding heterogenous amplification products, as indicated by asterisks in figure 4e.

given the efficiency of trα <dig> splicing in the rat construct , the complete lack of expression of trα <dig> splicing with the opossum minigene  was surprising. both the 5' and 3' splice sites corresponding to trα <dig> are highly conserved in the rat and the opossum , as are intronic sequences adjacent to 5' and 3' splice sites. despite the high conservation of these sequences in marsupials and eutherians, the opossum trα gene may lack cis-acting elements required for trα <dig> expression  <cit> . to extend this analysis chimeric minigenes were constructed and assayed for their ability to express trα <dig>  one construct, o-r, consisting of opossum exons 7- <dig> upstream of the rat trα <dig> 3' splice site and exon <dig>  expressed trα <dig> transcripts at levels similar to the rat minigene . sequencing of the rt-pcr product obtained from transfected cells confirmed that this product was accurately spliced from the homologous 5' splice site in exon  <dig> of opossum to exon  <dig> of rat. in contrast, the reciprocal construct  with rat sequences upstream  and opossum sequences downstream  was apparently unable to express spliced trα <dig> mrna. in all of the constructs tested, the upstream exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are efficiently and accurately spliced, but only in o-r, not o-o or r-o, is the downstream splice site corresponding to exon  <dig> efficiently used. these results demonstrate that sequences homologous to the trα <dig> 5' splice site in exon  <dig> of opossum are fully competent for splicing, while those homologous to the trα <dig> 3'ss in exon  <dig> are not.

to more precisely define cis-acting elements required for trα <dig> splicing, two additional minigenes were tested. the first of these, designated o/rx <dig>  was constructed from the o-r chimera by replacing the rat sequence upstream of the trα <dig> 3' splice site but downstream of intron  <dig> deletion with the opossum sequence present in the o-o minigene. the other chimeric minigene, o/rpa, was constructed by incorporating opossum sequences into the length of exon  <dig>  thus eliminating the rat 3'ss for trα <dig> while retaining the rat trα <dig> polyadenylation site . when these chimeric minigenes were transfected into hek  <dig> cells the efficiency of trα <dig> splicing was greatly reduced or eliminated. careful analysis revealed that the o/rx <dig> minigene expressed a small amount of correctly spliced chimeric trα <dig> mrna, as indicated by both rpa and rt-pcr assays, but with greatly reduced efficiency, strongly suggesting that opossum sequences in the intron upstream of exon  <dig> are incompatible with trα <dig> splicing.

post-run analysis of both r-o and o/rpa real-time products yielded a weak band in the region expected for correctly spliced product as indicated by the asterisks in figure 4c. however, the difference between trα <dig> and trα <dig> ct values  was comparable or less than that observed for the o-o minigene. correct splicing of these transcripts could not be confirmed by other assays. cryptic splicing within the opossum sequence in o/rpa,  <dig> nt from the chimeric junction of opossum and rat sequence, was detected by sequencing a band obtained by conventional pcr. conventional pcr also demonstrated that r-r, o-r and o/rx <dig> all express a small amount of spliced trα <dig>  a minor variant of trα <dig> that uses an alternative 3'ss  <dig> bp downstream of the trα <dig> 3'ss in exon  <dig>  <cit> . for r-r and o-r this represents a minor product, slightly smaller than that for trα <dig>  for o/rx <dig>  however, this band is proportionately more intense, indicating a loss of specificity as well as a greatly reduced efficiency of trα <dig> splicing for the o-rx <dig> minigene.

the analysis described above strongly suggests that opossum sequences upstream of the 3'ss are incompatible with trα <dig> splicing. the discrepancy between trα <dig> splicing of o-r and o/rx <dig> indicates that the trα gene of m. domestica lacks upstream cis-acting elements required for efficient splicing of trα <dig>  furthermore, inclusion of the rat trα <dig> polyadenylation site, which is not conserved in marsupial species , is insufficient to restore accurate and efficient splicing in chimeric constructs o/rx <dig> and o/rpa.

expression of endogenous and transfected mrnas in ptk <dig> cells
analysis of the splicing of chimeric minigenes demonstrates that the opossum sequences homologous to the 3'ss of trα <dig> splicing are not used efficiently. this most likely reflects the lack of cis-acting elements in opossum that are necessary for trα <dig> expression  <cit> . it is possible, however, that the failure of opossum tissues to express trα <dig> reflects the presence or absence of a factor that specifically affects trα <dig> processing. to test this possibility we examined the processing of the rat trα minigene in potoroo ptk <dig> cells. these cells, derived from kidney epithelium, endogenously expressed both trα <dig> and rev-erbα, but not trα <dig> . ptk <dig> cells were then transfected with three previously characterized full-length rat minigenes  <cit> : a wildtype minigene extending uninterrupted from exon  <dig> through exon  <dig> of trα <dig> ; a mutant with a single base replacement at the 5'ss of exon 9a , which overexpresses trα <dig> mrna; and a second mutant at that 5'ss with substitution at the adjacent site , which results in a decrease in trα <dig> mrna. when transfected into ptk <dig> cells, each of these constructs expressed trα <dig> and trα <dig> mrnas at levels expected from previous expression studies in rodent and human cells   <cit> . these results demonstrate that marsupial cells expressing only endogenous trα <dig> are fully capable of splicing rat trα <dig> 

discussion
results of these studies show that trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas are widely expressed in opossum in a manner similar to that in rodents, where both receptors are readily detectable in most tissues throughout development  <cit> , with expression peaking in post-natal, pre-weanling mice and rat. since marsupials are born at a relatively early stage of development and mature more slowly than rats and mice, the ages used here correspond roughly to late pre-natal through post-weanling stages in rats. the striking increase in the expression of rev-erbα in most tissues with increasing age is also consistent with that reported for rat  <cit> . however, the failure to detect expression of trα <dig> in a broad range of tissues at ages ranging from day  <dig> newborns to  <dig> month-old young adults contrasts strongly with the co-expression of all three of these mrnas from this locus in rats, mice and other mammals.

the expression of any one of these mrnas, trα <dig>  trα <dig> or rev-erbα, is almost always accompanied by expression of the other two, although the relative ratios vary widely  <cit> . our analysis focused on the expression of these receptors in the central nervous system, as trα <dig> mrna is expressed at much higher levels than trα <dig> in both cerebral cortex and cerebellum  <cit> . for example, in newborn rat brain trα <dig> mrna is more than 30-fold more abundant than trα <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, trα <dig> expression in rats is several fold greater than trα <dig> expression in brain, liver and kidney at all ages examined   <cit> , a striking contrast to the total absence of trα <dig> mrna observed here in opossum and ptk <dig> cells.

conservation of sequences in trα and rev-erbα
the conservation of sequence spanning the 3' ends of trα <dig> and rev-erbα has several features of interest with respect to the evolution of trα <dig> and the antisense overlap with rev-erbα. the amino acid sequence encoded by the 3' exon of rev-erbα is nearly identical in marsupial and eutherian mammals , suggesting that the coding sequence of rev-erbα accommodated the evolution of its antisense overlap with trα <dig> within its functional constraints as the coding sequence for trα <dig> threaded through  <dig>  codons of rev-erbα and into the final intron of the rev-erbα gene. interestingly, the one specific function ascribed to the unique c-terminal sequence of trα <dig>  that associated with phosphorylation of certain serine residues  <cit> , maps to positions in trα <dig> that are encoded antisense to the final intron of rev-erbα and are therefore not constrained by requirements for rev-erbα coding as shown in figure 2a.

the region in which the 3' ends of trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas converge is framed by exceptionally conserved sequences within the 3'utr of each mrna , suggesting the presence of numerous functional elements important for the expression and regulation of both nuclear receptor proteins. the apparent conservation of core splice site elements important for trα <dig> expression is puzzling, given the apparent absence of trα <dig> mrna in marsupials, and raises the question of whether these elements correspond to trα <dig> or have other functions. in particular, several features are consistent with conservation of the alternatively spliced trα2-specific exon in marsupials:  conservation of the non-canonical aag trinucleotide identical to that found in all known eutherian genomes at the 3' end of exon  <dig> for trα2;  the conservation of adjacent sequences corresponding to the 5' end of exon 10; and  the conservation of the polypyrimidine tract that is an essential feature of the core sequence of the 3'ss. in fact, the marsupial polypyrimidine tract appears a better match to the mammalian consensus sequence than that found in rat: a g at position - <dig> is replaced with t in all four marsupials and a somewhat higher proportion of t/c residues is present in the marsupial polypyrimidine tracts  <cit> .

however, other features of this region are consistent with the absence of trα <dig> in opossum:  the open reading frame corresponding to the extended c-terminus of trα <dig> is not conserved in four marsupials except for the first  <dig> codons of trα <dig> exon  <dig> in the opossums;  the bidirectional coding overlap with rev-erbα present in all eutherian species is eliminated in both opossums;  the trα <dig> orf is disrupted in wallaby and potoroo by a frame-shift deletion adjacent to the presumptive splice site;  a conserved polyadenylation signal corresponding to exon  <dig> of trα <dig> is absent, and there is overall poor conservation of sequence within the final intron of rev-erbα ; and  there is poor conservation of intronic and exonic splicing enhancer sequences required for trα <dig> splicing  <cit> . these include the seα <dig> enhancer downstream of the coding sequence for trα <dig>  <cit> , an intronic splicing enhancer near the 3' splice site of exon  <dig> and a exonic enhancer located within the bidirectional coding sequence of exon  <dig>  <cit> . taken together, these differences suggest that the conservation of the elements associated with trα <dig> mrna processing may reflect other functional requirements at this locus unrelated to trα <dig> expression.

splicing of trα <dig> mrna in chimeric minigenes
analysis of splicing of opossum and rat minigenes corroborated our finding that alternatively spliced trα <dig> mrna is missing in marsupials. most telling was the o/rx <dig> construct, which includes the entire length of rat exon  <dig>  identical to that in o-r, except for replacement of  <dig> bp of rat sequence upstream of the trα <dig> 3'ss with  <dig> bp of opossum sequence. the longer opossum sequence closely corresponds to a previously tested construct  which was spliced as efficiently as the shorter sequence  <cit> . the overall level of splicing of o/rx <dig> was <10% that of o-r and the predominant spliced product corresponded to trα <dig>  a minor splice variant isoform, not trα <dig>  as shown by sequencing of rt-pcr products . these experiments demonstrate that opossum sequences homologous to the trα2-specific 3'ss are almost completely inactive in splicing transfected minigenes. in addition to the role of these intronic sequences in blocking trα <dig> splicing, the opossum sequences also lacked a conserved polyadenylation signal hexanucleotide  that is conserved in all known trα <dig> mrnas. however, the inclusion of this element  in the o/rx <dig> and o/rpa minigenes was not sufficient to rescue efficient splicing.

evolution of trα <dig> mrna in mammals
a number of studies suggest that the evolution of new alternative exons provides an important pathway for the creation of novel proteins and regulatory pathways in eukaryotic cells  <cit> , reviewed in  <cit> . given the prominence of trα <dig> as an abundant isoform in eutherian mammals  <cit> , its proposed role as a dominant negative modulator of thyroid hormone activity  <cit>  and the possible regulatory implications of its overlap with rev-erbα  <cit> , the evolution and function of trα <dig> in mammals are of particular interest.

three distinct evolutionary scenarios or models may account for similarities and differences of this locus in marsupial species as summarized in figure  <dig>  the first scenario, in which trα <dig> expression is restricted to the eutherian lineage, suggests that some features of the marsupial trα/rev-erbα locus are intermediate between those of eutherian mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. for example, the poly sites of trα <dig> and rev-erbα are nearly identically spaced in rat and opossum and much closer than in the amphibian xenopus tropicalis, where they are more than  <dig> kb apart  <cit> . on the other hand, marsupials, like non-mammalian vertebrates, appear to lack an authentic trα <dig> isoform. also, the amino acid sequence of the marsupial trα <dig>  shows striking similarities to that of chicken. the opossum trα <dig> amino acid sequence differs from chicken in only  <dig> positions as compared to  <dig> positions in rat , despite a slightly greater similarity between the opossum and rat nucleotide coding sequences. in  <dig> of the  <dig> positions where opossum and rat trα <dig> differ, the opossum sequence is identical to that of chicken. most of these sites are also conserved in frog, a more distantly related vertebrate . these observations suggest that the marsupial trα locus has retained several characteristics reminiscent of non-mammalian vertebrates.

the second scenario, in which a truncated form of trα <dig> is expressed in some limited  fashion, also suggests that the marsupial locus may represent a stage intermediate between the more complex eutherian locus, with its extended antisense overlap with rev-erbα and abundant expression of trα <dig>  and the non-mammalian vertebrates, which entirely lack trα <dig>  support for this model is found in the fact that many features characteristic of the marsupial trα/rev-erbα locus are associated with the creation of novel alternatively spliced exons, according to several recent studies  <cit> . these include inefficient splicing coupled with restricted or low levels of expression, as posited in the second model, and the absence of an extended open reading frame.

the third scenario, that trα <dig> evolved early but was lost in the marsupial lineage, suggests that features characteristic of trα <dig> that are shared by marsupial and eutherian mammals are vestiges of this loss. these vestigial features may have acquired other secondary functions within this locus. although this scenario may appear overly complex and hence unlikely, careful analysis of nuclear receptor evolution throughout multiple metazoan phyla reveals that loss within a particular lineage is not at all uncommon  <cit> . among approximately  <dig> nuclear receptor proteins that appear to have been present in the last common ancestor of vertebrate and bilaterian invertebrate species, a number of nuclear receptors, including both thyroid hormone receptor genes, are missing entirely from major groups of animals such as nematodes or arthropods while specific orthologs for both thyroid hormone receptors and rev-erb are found in more distantly related animals, such as mollusks, tunicates and flatworms  <cit> .

although none of the three models can be definitively ruled out, on balance, the first scenario might be judged most likely. the failure to detect trα <dig> expression in tissues and stages where it is abundantly expressed in eutherians, the poor efficiency of trα <dig> minigene splicing, the absence of a discernible trα <dig> polyadenylation signal element and differences between the presumptive coding sequence for trα <dig> in two marsupial orders weigh against the second model. the differences and similarities among the marsupial sequences within the 3' utr of rev-erbα , including strict conservation of 3' processing sites for trα <dig> and rev-erbα, seem most consistent with the first model, in which sequence conservation reflects regulatory requirements for these convergent mrnas rather than vestiges of a once functional, alternatively spliced mrna, as suggested in the third model.

if the first scenario is correct, apparent similarities between marsupials and eutherians in the region corresponding to the trα <dig> 3' ss and exon  <dig> must reflect other conserved functions. the first model thus suggests core elements of the trα <dig> splice site were coopted   <cit>  during the evolution of trα <dig>  what, then, are the possible functions of these sequences? it is likely that they reflect the overlay of elements involved in regulating expression of trα and rev-erbα, as well as other possible roles. accumulating evidence suggests that sequences at the 3' ends of genes play multiple roles in regulating gene expression. these include target sites for microrna binding  <cit> , sites for binding of proteins regulating transcription termination, 3' end processing, turnover and translation  <cit> , and promoters for expression of non-coding transcripts that are often found within the 3' utrs of transcripts  <cit> .

physiological correlates of nuclear receptor function
the physiological role of trα <dig> has remained elusive since its discovery more than two decades ago, despite numerous genetic and molecular investigations of its function  <cit> . although many studies have focused on its role as a weak dominant negative competitor of trα <dig> or trβ isoforms  <cit> , other studies have pointed to its phosphorylation-dependent rna-binding activity and cytoplasmic localization  <cit> . these properties, along with the developmental regulation of its expression, suggest a role for trα <dig> in developmental regulation of t <dig> activity  <cit> . the present study strongly indicates that its function is specific to the eutherian lineage, and thus may ultimately be resolved by comparative analysis of relevant aspects of marsupial and eutherian physiology.

the multiple roles ascribed to rev-erbα and trα <dig> in metabolic, circadian and developmental signaling  <cit>  require a diversity of regulatory inputs that determine the expression and physiological activity of these receptors  <cit> . the evolution of the antisense overlap between trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas in eutherian mammals is likely to be associated with additional mechanisms that affect the expression or activity of both receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the trα/rev-erbα locus in four marsupial species strongly suggests that the alternatively spliced trα <dig> isoform, which is widely and abundantly expressed in all known eutherian mammals, is not present in marsupials. three observations support this conclusion: first, we can find no evidence for trα <dig> expression in any of multiple tissues or developmental stages surveyed; second, the coding sequence specific to trα <dig> is severely truncated in opossums and completely altered in the wallaby and potoroo; and third, opossum sequences homologous to the 3'ss specific for trα <dig> are utilized very inefficiently for splicing of chimeric minigenes. the antisense overlap between trα <dig> and rev-erbα mrnas, which is tightly conserved in eutherian mammals, appears to have evolved within the constraints of the conserved c-terminal coding sequence of rev-erbα. these results suggest that comparative analysis of these genes in marsupials and eutherian mammals will provide further insight into the evolution, function and expression of trα <dig> and the regulatory implications of its antisense overlap with rev-erbα.
