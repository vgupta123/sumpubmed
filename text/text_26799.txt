BACKGROUND
plants produce a great variety of secondary metabolites. it is estimated that between  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> metabolites per species can be expected  <cit> . this great biochemical diversity reflects the variety of environments in which plants live, and the way they have to deal with different environmental stimuli. the production of specialized secondary metabolites is assumed to protect plants against biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . although arabidopsis is a small plant with short generation time and highly reduced genome, it has a set of secondary metabolites that is as abundant and diverse as those of other plant taxa  <cit> . in recent years, this model plant was extensively used towards identification of genes and enzymes working in a complex network involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis and regulation  <cit> .

currently, genetic variation found between natural arabidopsis accessions is an important basic resource for plant biology  <cit> . arabidopsis with its extensive genetic natural variation provides an excellent model to study variation in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in natural populations. recent genetic analysis of natural variation in untargeted metabolic composition uncovered many qualitative and quantitative differences in metabolite accumulation between arabidopsis accessions  <cit> . numerous studies  <cit>  proved the presence of abundant genetically controlled variation for various classes of secondary metabolites. coumarins  are one of the secondary metabolite classes found in arabidopsis’ roots  <cit> . but up to now, nothing is known about natural variation in coumarins content between arabidopsis accessions.

coumarins are a group of important natural compounds that provide for the plant antimicrobial and antioxidative activities, and are produced as a defence mechanism against pathogen attack and abiotic stresses  <cit> . importantly, coumarins are widely recognized in the pharmaceutical industry for their wide range of therapeutic activities and are an active source for drug development. numerous coumarins have medical application in the treatment of burns and rheumatoid diseases. furanocoumarins, which are coumarin derivatives, are used in the treatment of leucoderma, vitiligo and psoriasis  <cit> , due to their photoreactive properties. moreover, they are used in symptomatic treatment of demyelinating diseases, particularly multiple sclerosis  <cit> . furanocoumarin-producing plants that are currently studied are non-model organisms  <cit>  and many approaches to identify the genes underlying genetic variation in coumarins accumulation are not yet available in those species. scopoletin, which is a major coumarin compound of arabidopsis, has been found in many plant species  <cit> , and was clearly shown to have antifungal and antibacterial activities important for medical purposes  <cit> . all these properties make coumarins attractive from the commercial point of view.

coumarins are derived from phenylopropanoid pathway, which serves as a rich source of metabolites in plants  <cit> . it was suggested that in arabidopsis several branch pathways leading from phenylpropanoid compounds to coumarins are probable  <cit> . scopoletin and scopolin biosynthesis was shown to be strongly dependent on the cyp98a <dig>  <cit> , which is the cytochrome p <dig> catalyzing 3′-hydroxylation of p-coumarate units in the phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> . the feruloyl-coa was suggested to be a major precursor in scopoletin biosynthesis  <cit> . a key enzyme involved in the final step of scopoletin biosynthesis, which is the conversion of feruloyl-coa into 2-hydroxy-feruloyl-coa, is encoded by a member of the iron  ii- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase  family, designated as f6′h <dig>  <cit> . despite the advances that have been made in previous years  <cit>  , many questions with regard to coumarins biosynthesis are still open  <cit> . in particular, the regulation of the biosynthesis of coumarins is not well understood. up to now, all studies investigating coumarins biosynthesis in the model plant arabidopsis were done with one laboratory accession col- <dig>  which was used as the genetic background of all mutant and transgenic plants.figure  <dig>

to gain an understanding of the genetic architecture of coumarins biosynthesis, we screened a set of arabidopsis accessions for variation in scopolin and scopoletin content, and subsequently conducted a quantitative trait locus  mapping. our study addressed the following questions. is there a natural variation in accumulation of scopolin and scopoletin between arabidopsis accessions and what are genetic regions responsible for the observed differences? what are candidate genes possibly underlying qtls involved in scopolin and scopoletin biosynthesis?

RESULTS
phenotypic variation between accessions
a set of seven natural arabidopsis accessions, which are the parents of existing ril populations and represent accessions from different locations, were used in the initial screening for variation in scopolin and scopoletin accumulation. accessions were grown in vitro in liquid cultures in order to obtain the optimal growth of plant roots. under these conditions, most of the scopoletin is stored in root cells in vacuoles as its glycoside form, scopolin. in order to reveal the content of both scopolin and that of scopoletin, a subset of the methanol extracts made from arabidopsis roots were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis in order to hydrolyze the glycoside forms of coumarins. using high-performance liquid chromatography , we detected in the roots scopoletin , as well as scopolin . the identification of scopoletin in hplc fraction  was further confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  by comparison to spectrum library . the quantification of coumarins in methanol root extracts made from seven arabidopsis accessions clearly showed the presence of natural variation in scopolin content before enzymatic hydrolysis  and scopoletin after hydrolysis . in spite of the fact that scopolin standard was not available and in order to unify further analysis, we measured the amounts of both scopolin and scopoletin as area% of total chromatogram signals. the statistically significant differences between group means for scopolin and scopoletin accumulation were determined by one-way anova . values that are not significantly different based on the post hoc test  are indicated by the same letters . based on the obtained results we have selected an advanced intercross recombinant inbred lines  mapping population derived from the cross between col- <dig> and est- <dig>  because these parents significantly differed in coumarins content. further genetic analysis was performed using values for the accumulation of scopolin before enzymatic hydrolysis and the content of scopoletin after hydrolysis of methanol extracts.figure  <dig>

genetic analyses of scopolin and scopoletin accumulation
the scopoletin and scopolin content values were determined for three biological replicates of ai-rils  and parental lines, which were grown in independent flasks in liquid cultures. a set of lines  showed a wider range of scopolin  and scopoletin  values than the ones observed for both parental lines , which indicated the presence of transgressive segregation and suggested that multiple loci contribute to variation in the estc population. the lowest scopolin content within ai-rils was  <dig>   that corresponds to 20% of the minimum col- <dig> value. the maximal relative value of scopolin was  <dig> , which corresponds to 159% of the maximal est- <dig> value. for scopoletin content, these values were respectively  <dig>   and  <dig>   . having a commercially available scopoletin standard, we were able to quantify the scopoletin contents as μg/g fresh weight  in both parental lines of the ai-rils mapping population  before and after enzymatic hydrolysis. the scopoletin levels in root samples not subjected to hydrolysis were ~3 μg/gfw and ~10 μg/gfw in col- <dig> and est- <dig> respectively, and ~16 μg/gfw and ~86 μg/gfw in samples after hydrolysis. these values correspond to ~ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 449 nmol/gfw respectively that is in the range found in the literature data, which vary from ~ <dig> to 1200 nmol/gfw depending on plant culture being used  <cit> . the calculated quantities of parental lines  can be used as references for the overall quantity of the products in the whole mapping population.figure  <dig>

in order to identify the fraction of variation that is genetically determined, the broad sense heritability  for scopolin and scopoletin content was estimated as described in methods section. in the ai-ril population, the broad sense heritability ranged from  <dig>  for scopoletin to  <dig>  for scopolin content . to explore the relationship between scopolin content in methanol root extracts before enzymatic hydrolysis and scopoletin levels in extracts subjected to hydrolysis, the mean values of coumarins for each ai-rils were used as phenotype values in trait correlation analysis. a relatively strong genetic correlation  was observed between the level of coumarins measured before and after hydrolysis in the ai-rils population, indicating genetic co-regulation of scopolin and scopoletin biosynthesis .figure  <dig>

mapping qtls for scopolin and scopoletin accumulation
six qtls were identified, with one qtl being detected for scopolin and five qtls for scopoletin accumulation . the qtl effect sizes ranged from the  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance explained by the qtl , with three of the six qtls having effect sizes below 10% pve. one qtl  was detected for scopolin accumulation at the bottom of chromosome  <dig>  explaining the  <dig> % pve , and five qtls  for scopoletin accumulation were identified on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . no qtls were detected on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  to improve the qtl model explaining variation in a scopoletin content, the mqm approach was performed using two qtls  as cofactors. we have included in the model qtl on chromosome  <dig> , despite its lod score was slightly below the threshold . the whole model explains  <dig> % variance for scopoletin content. no epistasis between the main effect loci were detected.table  <dig>

qtl mapping identifies known and new loci for coumarins biosynthesis
some of the mapped qtls underlying variation in scopolin  and scopoletin  accumulation in the ai-rils population, co-localize with the genes annotated to be involved in coumarin biosynthetic process . we detected seven cloned and characterized genes encoding enzymes for scopoletin and scopolin biosynthesis that co-localize with detected qtls . within the scl <dig> interval, which is characterized by one of the highest lod score values, there are two very good candidates. one of them is at5g <dig> encoding a shikimate o-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase , while the other one  encodes caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid o-methyltransferase . importantly, both genes are expressed in roots . within the sct <dig> and sct <dig> intervals underlying variation in scopoletin content more possible candidate genes were detected: at1g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  encoding proteins from o-methyltransferase family; at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> encoding isoforms of 4-coumarate:coa ligase ; at1g <dig> encoding acyl-coa synthetase ; and at1g <dig> encoding feruloyl coa ortho-hydroxylase  <dig> .table  <dig>

the selected intervals are associated with scopolin  and scopoletin  accumulation and are characterized by the highest percentage of phenotypic variance explained by each qtl and the highest lod score values. most of selected genes  are novel loci.



in order to reveal other candidate genes possibly underlying detected qtls, two qtls for scopoletin content  and one qtl associated with scopolin  accumulation were chosen for further in silico analyses. the selected intervals are characterized by the highest percentage of phenotypic variance explained by each qtl and the highest lod score values. the annotated functions for all genes located in the selected qtl intervals were checked. as a result, we selected genes encoding transcription factors that might be induced by environmental stresses and enzymes that according to the annotation functions could be possibly involved in scopolin and scopoletin biosythensis. subsequently, we performed in silico analysis of the tissue distribution and level of expression of selected genes. only genes that were expressed in roots were selected as possible candidates for further studies. as a result, we selected a set of genes that deserve close attention as possible new loci underlying variation in scopolin and scopoletin accumulation . among candidates possibly involved in scopoletin accumulation, a particularly interesting one is a cyp81d <dig> gene  encoding a member of the cytochrome p <dig> family, which is located within the qtl on chromosome  <dig> . according to the  <dig> genomes project database  and re-sequencing data of est- <dig> from our laboratory , the cyp81d <dig> gene contains several snps and one indel in the coding sequences of the parental lines of estc mapping population and in the other accessions tested in this study . other interesting candidates are three genes  located within the qtl interval on chromosome  <dig> , which encode members of the myb and wrky transcription factor families. these genes are relatively highly expressed in roots and their expression is induced by various environmental stresses  <cit> . a particularly interesting candidate that could be possibly linked to scopolin accumulation was detected within the qtl on chromosome  <dig> . it is at5g <dig> encoding a udp-glycosyltransferase, which is relatively highly expressed in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . according to the  <dig> genomes project and our re-sequencing data of est- <dig>  this gene contains several snps in the coding sequences of tested accessions including the parental lines . interestingly, the cyp81d <dig> and udp-glycosyltransferase sequences originating from est, est- <dig>  and est-1* that was re-sequenced in our laboratory are not identical . this needs to be further verified.

discussion
here, we report a qtl mapping study of variation in scopoletin and scopolin accumulation between two arabidopsis accessions and thereby we demonstrate the usefulness of arabidopsis natural variation in elucidating the genetic and molecular basis of coumarins biosynthesis.

a large number of arabidopsis recombinant inbred line  populations are available and extensively used for identification of numerous qtls controlling various traits such as growth, development or resistance to different biotic and abiotic stresses as well as the content of chemical compounds  <cit> . in most studies, the average number of qtls identified is between one and  <dig> and at least one major qtl is detected  <cit> . here, one qtl for scopolin and five qtls for scopoletin accumulation were detected, which is in agreement with the average result in the field. using an ai-rils mapping population has the advantage in comparison to rils due to the fact that the opportunity for recombination is increased before genotypes are fixed upon selfing  <cit> . as a result, using ai-rils mapping population that captures an increased number of recombination events  <cit> , enabled us to detect qtls with effect size as low as  <dig> % pve.

once qtl has been identified, the next challenge is to identify the gene underlying detected qtl. in most cases, a large number of genes that are present in the qtl interval cannot be directly tested for candidacy. in order to reduce the mapped region, a fine-mapping is performed in which many individuals are genotyped for markers around the qtl. more accurate qtl localization might lead to the selection of candidate genes. nonetheless, performing a fine mapping may be practically difficult if the qtl effect is relatively small  <cit> . when multiple data sets are available, which is the case for arabidopsis, it is possible to improve accuracy and to test the candidacy of genes within mapped qtl intervals  <cit>  based on the available information. therefore, it seems like a realistic possibility to identify candidate genes underlying a qtl by using the high throughput expression data and the complete genome sequences of numerous arabidopsis accessions that were used to construct mapping populations. there are successful examples of using expression arrays in identifying genes causally associated with quantitative traits of interest, both in plants and animals  <cit> . in this study, possible candidate genes were found within mapped qtl intervals for scopolin and scopoletin content, including known and novel loci. further functional analysis, including re-sequencing, characterization of loss-of-function alleles and conducting gene complementation either by crossing or genetic transformation, are required to prove the role of selected possible candidate genes in coumarins biosynthesis and their regulation.

expanding molecular understanding of coumarins biosynthesis at an ecological level will be beneficial for the future discovery of the physiological mechanisms of action of genes involved in coumarins biosynthesis. it was suggested recently that some members the 2′-og dioxygenase family, including the f6′h <dig> that is a key enzyme in scopoletin biosynthesis, may be involved in fe deficiency responses and metabolic adjustments linked to fe homeostasis in plant cells  <cit> . other latest studies showed that fe deficiency induces the secretion of scopoletin and its derivatives by arabidopsis roots  <cit> , and that f6′h <dig> is required for the biosynthesis of coumarins that are released into the rhizosphere as part of the strategy i-type fe acquisition machinery  <cit> . previously, the existence of natural variation in root exudation profiles was clearly detected among eight arabidopsis accessions  <cit> . the above mentioned findings make a study of coumarins biosynthesis in arabidopsis using naturally occurring intraspecific variation even more promising and up-to-date.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have presented here for the first time a presence of naturally occurring intraspecies variation in scopoletin and its glucoside, scopolin, accumulation among seven arabidopsis accessions. even though, these accessions do not completely represent a wide genetic variation existing in arabidopsis, it is assumed that these accessions should reflect genetic adaptation to local environmental factors  <cit> . a qtl mapping study of scopoletin and scopolin variation within estc mapping population was conducted leading to the identification of new loci. the results presented here suggest that natural variation in coumarins content in arabidopsis has a complex molecular basis. importantly, they also provide a basis for fine mapping and cloning of the genes involved in coumarins biosynthesis.
