BACKGROUND
plants possess an innate immune system that protects them from microbial pathogens, but lack the adaptive immunity of mammals  <cit> . each plant cell is capable of sensing non-self entities and mounting immune responses, demonstrating remarkable functional plasticity. recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  results in pamp-triggered immunity  that prevents pathogen colonization. in turn, pathogens have evolved effectors to dampen pamp-triggered signals and thereby attenuate pti. the plants can only activate a weak response known as basal immunity. some host plants have evolved resistance  proteins to detect the presence of pathogen effectors, inducing effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . activation of pti or eti leads to the generation of a blend of signal molecules, which move to distal tissues for the establishment of systemic acquired resistance . sar is a long-lasting immunity against a broad spectrum of pathogens  <cit> .

salicylic acid  is a key signal molecule for plant immunity against biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. it is not only required for the activation of sar  <cit> , but also plays an important role in plant basal immunity and eti  <cit> – <cit> . in plants, sa can be made through two metabolic pathways, the phenylalanine ammonia lyase -mediated phenylalanine pathway and the isochorismate synthase -mediated isochorismate pathway. although knockout of pal genes significantly reduces sa production  <cit> , the isochorismate pathway is thought to be more important during plant defense  <cit> . increasing cellular sa levels induces profound transcriptional changes that are largely governed by the transcription coactivator npr <dig>  genes). similarly to sa, npr <dig> is not only required for sar activation, but also plays a significant role in plant basal immunity and eti  <cit> – <cit> . interestingly, npr <dig> is also a feedback inhibitor of sa biosynthesis. after pathogen infection, npr <dig> plants accumulate significantly higher levels of sa  <cit> . hyperaccumulation of sa causes chlorosis in juvenile leaves and inflorescences of npr <dig> plants  <cit> . when grown on media containing high concentrations of sa, npr <dig> seedlings fail to develop beyond the cotyledon stage, while wild type displays tolerance to sa cytotoxicity  <cit> .

in eukaryotic cells, rna polymerase ii  catalyzes the transcription of protein-encoding genes. the elongator complex was first identified as an interactor of hyperphosphorylated rnapii in yeast  <cit> , and subsequently purified from mammalian and plant cells  <cit> . elongator consists of six subunits  with elp1- <dig> forming the core subcomplex and elp4- <dig> the accessory subcomplex  <cit> . among the six subunits, elp <dig> is the catalytic subunit, harboring a c-terminal histone acetyltranferase  domain and an n-terminal cysteine-rich motif that resembles an iron-sulfur  radical s-adenosylmethionine  domain  <cit> . elp <dig> alone has intrinsic hat activity and is capable of acetylating all four histones, whereas the six-subunit holo-elongator predominantly acetylates lysine- <dig> of histone h <dig> and lysine- <dig> of histone h <dig>  <cit> . consistently, the levels of acetylated histones h <dig> and h <dig> are reduced in yeast, mammalian, and plant elp mutants  <cit> . the radical sam domain of yeast elp <dig> is a structural motif required for the integrity of the complex  <cit> , whereas the archaea methanocaldococcus jannaschii elp <dig> binds and cleaves sam, a co-substrate involved in methyl group transfers, suggesting that m. jannaschii elp <dig> may have another catalytic function other than hat activity  <cit> . indeed, a recent study indicated that the radical sam domain of mouse elp <dig>  but not the hat domain, is required for zygotic paternal genome demethylation  <cit> .

elongator is involved in diverse cellular processes including histone modification, trna modification, exocytosis, α-tubulin acetylation, and zygotic paternal genome demethylation  <cit> . mutations in yeast elongator subunits lead to resistance to the zymocin γ-toxin subunit, sensitivity to salt, caffeine and temperature  <cit> . elongator deficiency in humans causes familial dysautonomia, an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by abnormally low numbers of neurons in the autonomic and sensory nervous systems  <cit> . in addition, elongator has been shown to regulate tumorigenicity and migration of melanoma cells  <cit> . in plants, mutations of elongator subunits result in pleiotropic effects including hypersensitivity to abscisic acid, resistance to oxidative stress, severely aberrant auxin phenotypes, disease susceptibility, and altered cell cycle progression  <cit> – <cit> .

in order to identify new components in sa signaling, we performed a genetic screen for suppressors of the npr <dig> mutation based on restoration of sa tolerance on half-strength ms medium supplemented with  <dig>  mm sa. a total of  <dig> gns  mutants showing restored sa tolerance have been isolated. we have previously described the gns <dig> mutant, which harbors a mutation in atelp <dig>  <cit> . here we report the isolation and characterization of the gns <dig> mutant, in which a frameshift mutation was identified in the arabidopsis elongator complex subunit  <dig> . our results indicate that, like atelp <dig>  atelp <dig> is required for plant basal immunity and eti but not for sar, and demonstrate that the hat and radical sam domains of atelp <dig> are essential for its function in plant immunity.

RESULTS
the gns <dig> mutation suppresses hyperaccumulation of sa in npr1
similarly to the previously characterized gns <dig> npr <dig> <cit> , the gns <dig> npr <dig> mutant not only exhibited partially restored sa tolerance , but also accumulated significantly less sa than npr <dig> after infection by the virulent bacterial pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola  es <dig> , suggesting that gns <dig> suppresses sa hyperaccumulation in npr <dig>  to test whether gns <dig> affects pathogen susceptibility, the growth of psm es <dig> was determined in gns <dig> npr <dig> plants. as shown in figure 1d, while psm es <dig> grew ~32-fold more in npr <dig> than in the wild type, its growth was further increased by ~10-fold in gns <dig> npr <dig> plants, indicating that the gns <dig> mutation compromises npr1-independent disease resistance.

the leaves of gns <dig> npr <dig> plants were a lighter shade of green than npr <dig> . the gns <dig> npr <dig> mutant was backcrossed to npr <dig> three times before further characterization. the f <dig> progeny were not sa tolerant and displayed npr <dig> morphology. of 72 f <dig> plants,  <dig> were gns2-like. the 1: <dig> gns2-like to npr1-like ratio , together with the f <dig> phenotypes fit the expectation that gns <dig> is a single, recessive mutation. to determine the co-segregation of gns <dig> morphology and sa tolerance, progeny from f <dig> plants with npr <dig> or gns <dig> morphology were examined. progeny from gns2-like parents were nearly all sa tolerant, while none or only a fraction of the progeny from npr1-like plants were sa tolerant, suggesting that the morphology and sa tolerance of gns <dig> co-segregate and are caused by the same mutation or two closely linked mutations.

the gns <dig> locus encodes the elongator subunit 3
to map the gns <dig> locus, homozygous gns <dig> npr <dig>  which is in columbia  background, was crossed with the polymorphic ecotype landsberg erecta . linkage analysis of 100 f <dig> plants with gns <dig> morphology placed the gns <dig> locus in the middle of the lower arm of chromosome  <dig>  between the molecular markers ciw <dig> and ciw <dig> . recombination analysis of 1352 f <dig> light green plants located the gns <dig> locus in between markers at the genetic loci at5g <dig> and at5g <dig> . one gene within this interval was atelp3/elongata <dig>   <cit> , which encodes the third subunit of the elongator complex. since gns <dig> resembled the previously characterized gns1/atelp2- <dig> mutants in sa responses  <cit> , gns <dig> might be atelp <dig>  the atelp <dig> coding region was therefore amplified from gns <dig> npr <dig> and sequenced. a deletion of a guanine  was detected in the first exon of atelp <dig>  which allowed the development of a dcaps marker to genotypically distinguish the mutant from the wild type . this mutation caused a frameshift, likely resulting in a truncated and non-functional protein.

to confirm that gns <dig> is atelp <dig>  the atelp <dig> cdna under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus was introduced into gns <dig> npr <dig>  the 35s::atelp <dig> transgene complemented all the phenotypes caused by the gns <dig> mutation in gns <dig> npr <dig>  including partially restored sa tolerance, light green coloration, reduced sa accumulation after psm es <dig> infection, and enhanced susceptibility to psm es <dig> . these results indicate that the mutation in atelp <dig> is responsible for the morphological and defense phenotypes of the gns <dig> npr <dig> plants. the gns <dig> mutant was therefore renamed atelp3- <dig> 

atelp <dig> positively contributes to salicylic acid responsiveness
compared with npr <dig>  atelp3- <dig> npr <dig> exhibited delayed and reduced expression of pr <dig> and pr <dig> during psm es <dig> infection . to test the function of atelp <dig> in the presence of npr <dig>  atelp3- <dig> npr <dig> was crossed with wild type, and atelp3- <dig> single mutants were identified in the segregating f <dig> population based on their morphology  and confirmed by the atelp3- <dig> and npr <dig> dcaps markers . the atelp3- <dig> single mutant displayed decreased and/or delayed pr gene expression and enhanced susceptibility to psm es <dig>  and these phenotypes were all completely complemented by a 35s::atelp <dig> transgene , confirming that atelp3- <dig> is a loss-of-function mutation.

when treated with sa, atelp3- <dig> exhibited delayed pr gene expression , supporting the conclusion that elongator plays a role downstream of sa in plant immune responses  <cit> . on the other hand, sa treatment substantially protected both atelp3- <dig> and wild type against psm es <dig> . we further analyzed the interaction between sa treatment and genotype with a linear mixed-effects model  <cit> , and found that the atelp3- <dig> mutation did not significantly affect sa-induced resistance against psm es <dig> .

atelp <dig> positively regulates effector-triggered immunity
to test whether atelp <dig>  like atelp <dig>  plays a role in eti, we examined the expression profiles of nine defense genes that are rapidly induced during eti  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, after infection with the eti-inducing bacterial pathogen p. s. pv. tomato  dc3000/avrrpt <dig>  induction of all nine genes was delayed in atelp3- <dig> compared with that in the wild type, though expression of some genes eventually reached wild-type levels. furthermore, pst dc3000/avrrpt <dig> growth was ~10-fold more in atelp3- <dig> than in the wild type but lower than in the fully susceptible rps <dig> mutant   <cit> . in the double mutant atelp3- <dig> npr <dig>  however, pst dc3000/avrrpt <dig> growth was ~35-fold higher than in either atelp3- <dig> or npr <dig>  and about sevenfold higher than in rps <dig> . these results are consistent with the conclusion that both elongator and npr <dig> positively regulate eti  <cit> . using a linear mixed-effects model to statistically analyze the data in figure 5b, we found that the atelp3- <dig> and npr <dig> mutations did not have statistically significant genetic interaction in resistance against pst dc3000/avrrpt <dig> ; therefore, atelp <dig> and npr <dig> appear to function largely independently of each other in eti-mediated resistance to pst dc3000/avrrpt <dig>  however, since the p value is very close to the significance threshold , we cannot rule out the possibility of genetic interaction between atelp <dig> and npr <dig>  indeed, our recent work indicated that atelp <dig> regulates both npr1-dependent and -independent defense gene induction  <cit> .

atelp <dig> is not required for biological induction of systemic acquired resistance
we next analyzed the induction of sar in atelp3- <dig> plants. three lower leaves were injected with 10 mm mgcl <dig>  or psm es <dig> . after two days, sar treatment-induced gene expression in the upper, untreated leaves was examined. six genes that are induced during sar  <cit>  were strongly npr1-dependent, but only required atelp <dig> for their full expression . expression levels of these genes were significantly higher in atelp3- <dig> plants than in npr <dig> plants . when the upper, untreated systemic leaves were challenge-inoculated with psm es <dig>  atelp3- <dig> exhibited similar levels of resistance as the wild type . using a linear mixed-effects model to statistically analyze the data in figure 6b, we found that the atelp3- <dig> mutation did not have statistically significant effect on sar treatment-induced resistance to psm es <dig> . therefore, sar induction restores pathogen resistance to atelp3- <dig> plants, which supports the conclusion that elongator is not required for sar activation  <cit> .

both hat and radical sam domains of atelp <dig> are required for its function in plant immunity
elp <dig> is the catalytic subunit of the elongator complex, containing a hat domain and a radical sam domain. both domains are required for elongator’s function in yeast, whereas only the radical sam domain is essential for mouse paternal genome demethylation in zygotes  <cit> . to test whether the hat and the radical sam domain of atelp <dig> are required for elongator’s function in plant immunity, we introduced point mutations into the atelp <dig> cdna to generate a hat domain mutant, in which two conserved tyrosine residues  were changed to alanine, and a radical sam domain mutant, in which two conserved cysteine residues  were changed to serine   <cit> . mutated atelp <dig> cdnas were put under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter and transformed into atelp3- <dig> and atelp3- <dig> npr <dig> to test the functionality of the hat and the sam mutant. multiple transgenic lines were generated and characterized for both constructs, and one representative transgenic line for each construct was shown in figure  <dig>  neither the hat nor the sam mutant complemented any of the atelp3- <dig> phenotypes, including partially restored sa tolerance , reduced sa accumulation after psm es <dig> infection , delayed/decreased defense gene expression , and enhanced susceptibility to psm es <dig> , indicating that both the hat and radical sam domains of atelp <dig> are essential for its function in plant immune responses.

discussion
the multiprotein complex elongator functions in diverse biological processes in yeast, animals, and plants likely by accelerating the induction of genes required for development or adaptation to changing environmental conditions. in arabidopsis, elongator regulates transcriptional changes induced during pathogen infection  <cit> . these transcriptional changes are accompanied by changes in dna methylation, a hallmark of transcriptional suppression  <cit> , and histone acetylation, which is generally associated with transcriptional activation  <cit> . since the elongator complex subunit atelp <dig> contains both hat and radical sam domains, it seems possible that the enzymatic activities of elongator are directly involved in altering the chromatin status of defense genes to facilitate their induction. fortuitously, we were able to isolate an atelp <dig> mutant in our genetic screen for suppressors of the npr <dig> mutation based on restoration of sa tolerance   <cit> . the atelp3- <dig> mutant displays similar deficiencies in basal immunity and eti as atelp <dig> , and like atelp <dig> has normal sar , suggesting that the elongator complex itself, but not atelp <dig> individually, is the functional unit of action for its role in plant immunity. indeed, t-dna insertion mutants of other subunits of the arabidopsis elongator complex exhibit atelp2- and atelp3-like morphology  <cit> . the function of these subunits in plant immunity will be a subject of further inquiry.

transgenic complementation of atelp3- <dig> with the atelp <dig> gene lacking conserved residues in the hat domain did not restore wild-type levels of sa tolerance, sa accumulation, defense gene induction, and pathogen resistance . although elongator’s hat activity has not been demonstrated in plants, it has been proven in yeast  <cit> . consistent with this, the levels of acetylated histones are reduced in yeast, mammalian, and plant elp mutants  <cit> . previously we found reduced histone acetylation levels at several defense genes in atelp <dig>  which was correlated with delayed and/or decreased induction of these genes  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that elongator-dependent histone acetylation may maintain an inducible state at defense loci in arabidopsis.

conserved residues in the radical sam domain proved equally important for atelp3’s function in plant immunity . although these data demonstrate the importance of the domain, since the enzymatic activity of this domain is currently unknown, the reason for this importance remains elusive. one possibility is that the radical sam domain is important for the structural integrity of the protein complex, and in yeast, this has been shown to be the case  <cit> . alternatively, elp <dig> may bind and cleave sam, as seen in the archaea m. jannaschii <cit> . indeed, a recent study indicated that the radical sam domain of mouse elp <dig>  but not the hat domain, is required for zygotic paternal genome demethylation  <cit> . previously we found altered dynamic dna methylation changes induced by pathogen infection at some defense loci in atelp <dig>  which was also correlated with delayed and/or decreased induction  <cit> . therefore, elongator may also modulate chromatin at defense loci in arabidopsis through dna methylation.

another, non-mutually exclusive possibility is that the role of elongator in plant immunity depends on its function in the modification of wobble uridine trna. in yeast and plants, elongator is essential for these modifications  <cit> . using overexpression of hypomodified uridine-containing trnas, all phenotypes of yeast elp mutants were shown to stem from reduced formation of fully modified trnas  <cit> . most yeast mutations in the radical sam domain result in complete loss of the modified nucleoside 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine , while mutations of the hat domain result in the loss of the majority of mcm5s2u. loss of mcm5s2u is closely correlated with the elp mutant phenotypes  <cit> . in yeast, mutations of conserved amino acids in the sam domain do not abrogate hat or rna binding activity  <cit> ; therefore, for all elongator roles examined including plant immunity, with the exception of zygotic paternal genome demethylation  <cit> , both the hat and radical sam domains of elp <dig> are essential, but neither is sufficient. since plant elongator is also essential for wobble uridine trna modifications  <cit> , it is possible that the immune phenotypes, as well as other elp phenotypes, including altered histone modification and dna methylation profiles, could be indirect effects of trna modification defects in these mutants. future investigations in plants should address this important question.

accumulating evidence from diverse organisms is starting to paint a picture where the transcriptional role of elongator is to facilitate the induction of genes in general. indeed, previous work performed in our lab and elsewhere has shown that elongator influences the inducibility of thousands of genes  <cit> . in this study we established that the hat and radical sam domains of the arabidopsis elongator subunit atelp <dig> are essential for elongator’s immune function. elongator has also been implicated in diverse stress responses including oxidative and drought stress in arabidopsis  <cit> . it would be interesting to determine the role of the hat and radical sam domains of atelp <dig> in these processes. in this regard, the hat and radical sam domain mutants generated in this study provide a useful tool for dissecting the role of these domains throughout development and under diverse stress conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we isolated the gns <dig> mutant and cloned the gns <dig> gene using a map-based cloning approach. we found that gns <dig> encodes the elongator subunit atelp <dig>  characterization of gns2/atelp3- <dig> indicates that atelp <dig> is required for basal immunity and eti, but not for sar, suggesting that elongator as a whole is likely involved in basal immunity and eti, but not in sar. furthermore, we demonstrate that atelp3’s function in plant immunity requires both the hat and radical sam domains, which is consistent with a role of elongator in facilitating the transcriptional induction of defense genes through alterations to their chromatin.
