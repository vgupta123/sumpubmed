BACKGROUND
cucurbita maxima including pumpkin, hubbard, turban and buttercup squash, is native to south america and belongs to the genus cucurbita l. with n =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> . pumpkin is one of the most economically important crops within this species  <cit> , and commonly known as winter squash with its mature fruits consumed as vegetables in most of the world, especially in asia  and africa. even in developing countries, pumpkin is a staple food and a rich source of fat, iron, calcium and vitamins  <cit> . in addition, pumpkin seeds are also used as food, because they are excellent sources of proteins , oil  and vitamin e  <cit> . the interspecific hybrids of c. maxima × c. moschata are important rootstocks of cucumber and watermelon to increase crop disease resistance, stress-tolerance and yield, and improve fruit quality .

despite its economic importance, there are very limited genomic and genetic resources available for c. maxima; unlike other cucurbits, such as cucumber, watermelon and melon, even c. pepo and c. moschata, for which dense genetic maps , microarrays  <cit> , reverse genetic platforms , transcriptomes  and even whole genome sequences  have been developed and generated. these resources have provided powerful tools for genetic and genomic analysis in exploring gene functions and genetic diversities, and facilitating classical linkage mapping and association mapping, and breeding new varieties .

saturated genetic linkage maps are critical for assembled genome scaffold anchoring and orienting, quantitative trait locus  mapping and efficient molecular breeding  <cit> . however, genetic mapping of c. maxima is still in its infancy, with only three low-resolution genetic maps reported . recent advancements in high-throughput genotyping technologies, such as genotyping-by-sequencing   <cit> , have provided rapid, efficient and cost-effective genotyping approaches, which have proven their efficiency in saturated genetic map construction and gene/qtl mapping in a variety of different species  <cit> .

dwarf vine is an important agronomic trait targeted for selection in pumpkin breeding due to its contribution to yield and labor-saving in management and harvesting. in tropical pumpkin  and squash , the bush type  is controlled by a dominant gene, and some bush-type related genes and tightly linked markers have been reported . in c. maxima, the dwarf vine is possibly mainly controlled by two recessive genes which are orthologous to the dwarf genes in c. pepo, and might also be regulated by other minor genes  <cit> . recently, a c. maxima dwarf mutant was reported and the underlying gene was roughly mapped using aflp markers to a region with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm  <cit> . four dwarf-related transcript derived fragments , which were involved in cytokinin or indole acetic acid signaling, were identified  <cit> . the genes controlling dwarf traits in other cucurbitaceae crops such as melon and cucumber have also been fine mapped recently  <cit> . although many studies have been reported on dwarf traits in cucurbitaceae, to date no dwarf genes have been cloned.

in this study, a c. maxima population with 186 f <dig> individuals was generated from a cross between an inbred line with long vine , rimu, and a line with dwarf vine , sq <dig>  the vine length in the f <dig> population showed a continuous phenotypic variation. the vine length trait was found to be quantitative in nature and the dwarf-type was gibberellin-responsive. the population was then genotyped using the gbs approach, resulting in a total of  <dig> recombinant bin markers, which were used to create the first high resolution genetic map in c. maxima that comprised  <dig> linkage groups. the map was further used to assist in anchoring and orienting the assembled c. maxima genome scaffolds. moreover, the vine length was measured for individual plants in the f <dig> population and an association analysis was then performed to identify qtls for the dwarf vine trait. the high-density genetic map we constructed provided an invaluable new tool for genetic research and molecular breeding in c. maxima.

RESULTS
sequencing, genotyping, and genetic map construction
two 96-plex gbs libraries were constructed for the two parents  and 186 f <dig> plants of the cross rimu × sq <dig>  a total of  <dig> million cleaned reads were obtained, and the number of reads per sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million, with an average of  <dig>  million reads for each individual, which was equivalent to ~ <dig> -fold coverage of the c. maxima genome which was estimated to have a size of approximately  <dig>  mb based on the k-mer analysis of the large-scale illumina genome sequences. of these reads,  <dig>  million  were mapped to the c. maxima genome assembly and used for snp calling. the resulting snps were filtered if there was no homozygous variation found between the two parents. a total of  <dig>  snps were obtained, among which  <dig>  snps had less than 20 % missing data and a minimum allele frequency  ≥  <dig> . these  <dig>  segregating snps were used for genetic linkage map construction and scaffold anchoring, which yielded a genome-wide snp density of ~ <dig> snp/ <dig>  kb.

due to the relatively small size of the mapping population , many of the  <dig>  snps co-segregated in the f <dig> population, suggesting that these loci were in close proximity and had not been resolved by recombination events. therefore, these snps were further concatenated into  <dig> bin markers, with snps in one bin considered as a single haplotype. finally, a total of  <dig> of the  <dig> bin-markers were mapped to create the  <dig> linkage groups  that corresponded to the  <dig> chromosomes of pumpkin, with a mean of  <dig>  markers per lg. the lgs had an estimated total genetic length of  <dig> .8 cm and an average of approximately  <dig>  cm per bin . the distance between neighboring bin markers ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. based on the estimated size of the pumpkin genome , the map defined herein represented an average physical interval of  <dig>  kb per marker, making it the most saturated genetic map of c. maxima to date. the size of lgs ranged from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  with the number of bin markers per lg ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  in this map eight large gaps  between scaffolds in lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were detected .fig.  <dig> anchoring of the c. maxima assembled scaffolds to the rimu × sq <dig> f <dig> genetic map. open bars represent the  <dig> c. maxima linkage groups ; snps are located on the lgs according to the genetic distance . pumpkin genome scaffolds  are positioned in each lg with corresponding genetic markers. blue, scaffolds in positive orientation; green, scaffolds in negative orientation ; black, scaffolds that were anchored but not oriented



segregation distortion plays a dominant part in the plant genome evolution  <cit> . in our map two segregation distortion regions  were detected in lgs  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  . the sdr in lg  <dig> spanned relatively large fraction of the lg, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm , with marker alleles associated with the rimu parent. marker alleles within the sdr of lg  <dig> skewed toward the sq <dig> parent.

scaffold anchoring and orienting
the map was further used to anchor and orient the assembled genome scaffolds of the maternal parent of the f <dig> population, rimu, to the  <dig> lgs. altogether,  <dig> scaffolds with a total length of  <dig>  mb, accounting for  <dig>  % of the assembled  <dig>  mb sequences were successfully anchored . the number of scaffolds anchored per lg ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with sizes ranging from  <dig>  mb  to  <dig>  mb . on average, each scaffold contained eight markers, and  <dig> scaffolds  were anchored by at least two different markers, which could be oriented with high confidence on the genetic map . for the remaining  <dig> smaller scaffolds  that had only one genetic marker, their orientation on the map could not be determined. although the average marker distance was  <dig>  kb, large gaps were present on the physical map, e.g., a  <dig> -mb gap in scaffold s <dig> on lg  <dig> between s13_ <dig> and s13_ <dig> and a  <dig> -mb gap in scaffold s <dig> on lg  <dig> between s32_ <dig> and s32_ <dig> table  <dig> anchoring of c. maxima genome assembly to the genetic map



qtl identification for dwarf vine
the maternal line rimu and the male parent sq <dig> had mean vine length of 256 cm and 73 cm at the 25th internode, respectively, and the f <dig> plants presented an intermediate vine length of 154 cm . the dwarf sq <dig> plants produced shorter vines, as well as fewer and shorter internodes than the vine type rimu and f <dig> plants at 30th and 60th day after sowing  . transgressive segregation was observed in the f <dig> population for vine length and the average value skewed toward the long vine parent. frequency distribution of vine length among the test lines is presented in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  using joint analysis , three qtls associated with dwarf vine were detected on lgs  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively , with additive effects ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and r <dig> values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. as expected, the elite parental cultivar  contributed the dwarf vine alleles at all loci. qcmb <dig>  the qtl with the largest effect on vine length, explained  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation and mapped to a region between s5_ <dig> and s5_ <dig>  which spanned a genetic distance of about  <dig>  cm and corresponded to a physical distance of about  <dig>  mb . the other two minor qtls explained  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation, respectively. in addition, when the f <dig> individuals were arbitrarily divided into three groups with short, median and long vines, these three qtls could still be identified based on a permutation determined lod threshold of  <dig> fig.  <dig> vine length of the two parents and the f <dig> and f2: <dig> lines. a, the inbred line rimu; b, the inbred line sq026; c, f1; d, the representative f2: <dig> bush type line; e, the representative f2: <dig> vine type line. red arrows point to the vine tips; f-h, vine length, internode number and the average internode length at  <dig> and 60 days after sowing . bars show mean ± se . different letters indicate significant difference at p <  <dig>

a candidate gibberellin biosynthesis gene in the major qtl region controlling vine length
the small physical interval of qcmb <dig>  encompassed  <dig> predicted protein-coding genes . many studies have shown that most dwarf or semi-dwarf type varieties were caused by the deficiency of genes involved in the gibberellin  biosynthesis or signaling . the dwarf lines in c. maxima were ga-sensitive as their vine length was increased significantly after treated with ga . among the genes in the genomic region of qcmb <dig>  three genes  encoding 2-oxoglutarate  and fe-dependent dioxygenase superfamily proteins, which are possibly involved in the ga biosynthesis  <cit> , were identified. we then performed genome resequencing for the male parent, sq <dig>  and obtained a total of  <dig>  million paired-end reads with length of 100 bp. by aligning these reads to the assembled genome of rimu, the maternal parent, we identified a  <dig> -bp insertion/deletion   and two snps in the promoter region and a 3-bp indel and  <dig> snps in the intronic region of cma_ <dig> . these sequence variations were further verified by pcr cloning and sequencing. two pcr-based molecular markers targeting this  <dig> -bp indel, named indel <dig> and indel <dig>  were developed . all f <dig> individuals were genotyped using these two markers , and the  <dig> -bp indel polymorphism was found to completely co-segregate with the dwarf vine in the f <dig> and the f2: <dig> populations without any recombinants . validation of this indel polymorphism in  <dig> pumpkin varieties which are either bush or vine habits showed that the marker could accurately identify the phenotypes . the physical position of the cma_ <dig> gene in the pumpkin genome is  <dig> - <dig>  bp on the scaffold s <dig>  which is very close to the peak of lod curve for the vine length qtl qcmb <dig> .fig.  <dig> structure of the gene cma_ <dig> and genotyping of the f <dig> population. a, schematic diagram of gene structure of cma_ <dig>  solid boxes represent coding regions; open boxes with diagonal lines denotes the deleted fragment of the promoter region of cma_ <dig> in bush type lines; bold lines, introns or 5′, 3′- utrs. locations of the indel-markers indel <dig>  amplified using the primers p1/p <dig>  and indel <dig>  amplified using the primers p3/p <dig>  are shown. b, genotyping of the f <dig> population by the two indel markers. m, dna marker; p <dig>  maternal parent rimu; p <dig>  paternal parent sq026; 1– <dig>  individual f <dig> lines; ge, genotypes; v, vine type; b, bush type



we further investigated the expression pattern of cma_ <dig> with semi-quantitative pcr and qpcr in two parental lines to check whether the expression level was affected by the sequence deletion in the promoter region and contributed to the variance of vine length . the cma_ <dig> transcripts were highly abundant in elongated vines  and flowers , also present in leaves and tips of the vines, and almost undetectable in roots and fruits. the expression level of cma_ <dig> was significantly increased during the vine elongating process , and was significantly higher in the vine type lines than in the bush type lines  . in transient expression assays, the activity of the promoter of cma_ <dig> in bush type line was much weaker than that in the vine type line . the expression of another ga 20-oxidase gene in the region of qcmb <dig>  cma_ <dig>  was restricted to roots, and another gene, cma_ <dig>  was expressed at the similar level in all tested tissues.fig.  <dig> expression profiles of cma_ <dig> in c. maxima. a, rt-pcr analysis of cma_ <dig>  cma_ <dig> and cma_ <dig> mrna in various tissues. r, roots; v, vines; tv, tip of the vines; l, leaves; fb, flowers before anthesis; fa, flowers after anthesis; fr, young fruits; das, days after sowing. p <dig>  maternal parent rimu; p <dig>  paternal parent sq026; the right side shows the pcr amplification cycles. ef-1a was used as the internal control. b, analysis of cma_ <dig> gene expression in vines by real-time pcr. each bar represents an average of three independent reactions, including both biological and technical replicates. error bars indicated sd. c, analysis of the activities of the cma_ <dig> promoters by transient expression in tobacco leaves. a, promoter of the vine type; b, promoter of the bush type



phylogenetic analysis showed that cma_ <dig> was the ortholog of mtga20ox1-b, the gibberellin  <dig> oxidase 1-b gene in medicago truncatula , suggesting cma_ <dig> is a possible enzyme that catalyzes the last three steps of the synthesis of active gas in c. maxima. all data present here provides evidences supporting that cma_ <dig> could be a candidate gene controlling vine length in c. maxima.

discussion
in this study, we described the construction of the first high-density genetic map in c. maxima using the bin-markers developed using the gbs technology. this linkage map was further used as a reference to successfully anchor and orient the full genome assembly and to map qtls for dwarf vine in this species. this map will be valuable for future gene cloning, qtl mapping and marker assisted breeding, and provide a basis for comparative analysis among cucurbit genomes. in addition, the identified qtls for dwarfism also provide a solid foundation for the characterization of the dwarf gene and uncovering the molecular mechanisms of the dwarfism in pumpkin.

high-density genetic map construction and genome assembly anchoring in c. maxima
the genetic linkage map reported herein is the first map developed using bin markers derived from snps in c. maxima. compared to previously reported cucurbita maps , this map had much higher marker density and fewer gaps, making it the most saturated genetic map in cucurbita species reported to date. furthermore, all bin markers used here possess their unique physical locations in the c. maxima reference genome, and are potentially highly transferable among species and even genera, which will facilitate the development of an integrated cucurbita map by merging different maps  <cit> . the map will also allow comparative genetic studies within this genus and may further elucidate the evolution of different species in the genus. however, several large gaps still exist in this genetic map; therefore, additional markers need to be developed in order to get a better covered map.

distorted segregation was observed in  <dig> bin markers, which was lower than that reported in maps constructed in c. pepo and from interspecific crosses  <cit> . biological segregation distortion can affect a cluster of loci, and form a sdr, which should contain at least three adjacent loci  <cit> . based on this criterion, two sdrs were found, one on lg  <dig> and the other on lg  <dig> , and both were located near the end of lgs, possibly due to gametic, zygotic or other selections. other distortion loci scattered along the lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were likely a result of non-biological factors, including the bias introduced in the gbs library construction  and missing data points in snp calling. marker inconsistency was also observed in a few regions, mostly caused by duplicated marker loci or segregation distortions  <cit> .

using this map we successfully anchored  <dig> scaffolds  and oriented  <dig>  mb  of the assembled sequences. compared to the percentages of anchored and oriented genome sequences in other crop species such as watermelon   <cit> , melon   <cit> , cucumber   <cit> , cacao   <cit> , apple   <cit> , grape   <cit> , soybean   <cit>  and strawberry   <cit> , the percentages of anchored and oriented scaffolds in this study were not high. the major factor that limits successful anchoring and orienting of scaffolds is the map density, which depends on the snp density and the size of the mapping population. low sequencing coverage and probably the non-optimal restriction enzyme used in the gbs experiment would result in sparse snp markers. therefore, additional markers and a larger mapping population would help to generate a higher density genetic map, which can be used to further facilitate anchoring and ordering of the remaining sequences.

qtl analysis for the bush type vine
using the map, a major qtl qcmb <dig> for dwarfism in c. maxima was identified and delimited to a 420-kb physical interval. the qtl contributed to  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variation, suggesting the high efficiency in qtl detection using this approach . among the  <dig> predicted genes within the qtl region, cma_ <dig> encoded a putative gibberellin 20-oxidase and shared  <dig>  and  <dig>  % amino acid sequence identity with arabidopsis gibberellin 20-oxidase  <dig> and medicago truncatula gibberellin 20-oxidase 1-b, respectively. the physical position of cma_ <dig> was very close to the peak of lod curve for vine length qtl qcmb <dig> . the sq <dig>  allele of cma_ <dig> perfectly co-segregated with the dwarf phenotype across the f <dig> and f2: <dig> populations and a broad range of c. maxima germplasm. the large sequence deletion identified in the promoter region of cma_ <dig> possibly caused the decreased expression of cma_ <dig>  which could further decrease the gibberellin level and result in the dwarf phenotype  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that cma_ <dig> is the candidate gene for dwarfism in c. maxima. however, further experiments are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. in addition, the other two minor qtls  also need to be further characterized.

dwarf gene in c. maxima
dwarf and semi-dwarf characteristics are important agronomic traits in crop breeding for higher yield. in cucurbitaceae, dwarf mutants in cucumber  <cit> , melon  <cit> , squash  <cit> , tropical pumpkin  <cit>  and c. maxima  <cit>  have been reported, but little is known about the underlying genetic basis of dwarfism. incomplete dominance or developmental reversal of dominance was observed in the present study. f <dig> plants of the cross between bush and vine plants resembled the bush parent at the early developmental stages while become more like the vine parent at the late stages . this is consistent with previous observations in c. pepo and c. maxima, the two species possibly possessing the same dwarf gene  <cit> , while it is contradictory to other previously published reports  <cit> , which indicate that the phenotype of bush habit is a completely dominant trait. singh  <cit>  reported the length of vine was controlled by two pairs of common dominant genes in c. maxima. these inconsistent results are probably due to the fact that bush habits are controlled by multiple different genes or due to the different genetic background of the plant materials used for the studies.

alternatively, these differences in c. maxima could be caused by developmental dominance reversal of the dwarf gene. we provide support for cma_ <dig>  which encodes a ga 20-oxidase, as a candidate gene for dwarfism in c. maxima. gibberellin  deficiency always leads to dwarf or semi-dwarf phenotype . the defective ga 20-oxidase genes in rice and arabidopsis result in the semi-dwarf phenotypes, suggesting that other gene members could supplement ga 20-oxidase activity and contribute partially to the active ga in stem elongation  <cit> . therefore, we propose that the developmental reversal of dominance of dwarf gene is caused by the partial overlapping redundancy of ga20-oxidase genes in c. maxima. cma_ <dig> is probably critical for active ga at the early developmental stages, but its function could be compensated by other gene members at the late stages , resulting in behaving dominantly during the early vine development while recessively during the late vine development. further evaluation of the ga contents in the bushy plants at different development stages and functional characterization of cma_ <dig> and its closely related genes should facilitate uncovering the regulatory mechanisms underlying this trait.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we report the construction of the first high-density linkage map in c. maxima with bin markers developed using the gbs method, which represents the initial reference map of this species. this map successfully assisted in anchoring and orienting the assembled genome scaffolds, and was further used to detect the quantitative loci controlling vine length in c. maxima. a highly possible candidate gene for the major qtl qcmb <dig> was identified. this study provides deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying vine variation in c. maxima and will be helpful in accelerating crop improvement in a cost-effective manner through selecting the useful alleles.
