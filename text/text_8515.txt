BACKGROUND
neutrophils are the most numerous granulocytes in blood and are responsible for the first line of host defence. however, neutrophils have frequently been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases because they can produce various cytokines, chemokines and other proinflammatory mediators  <cit> . numerous studies have been performed on the mechanisms that regulate the bioactivity of neutrophils. understanding patterns of expressed genes may provide insight into complex regulatory networks and help to identify genes implicated in diseases. quantitative real time pcr is one of the most powerful quantification methods for gene expression analysis. similar to other methods used in expression studies, data from samples are usually required to be normalized against a set of data or references to correct for the difference in the amount of starting materials. the genes used as references are often referred to as housekeeping genes, assuming that those genes are constitutively expressed in certain tissues and under certain circumstances. however, the literature shows that the expression levels of the so called "housekeeping genes" may vary in different tissues, different cell types, and different disease stages  <cit> . therefore, the selection of the reference genes is critical for the interpretation of the expression data.

in this study, we investigated  <dig> commonly used housekeeping genes , and found  <dig> genes could be preferential reference genes for gene expression studies in human neutrophils.

RESULTS
rna quality and quantity
rna analysis by an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer provided the size profiles and the concentration of the samples. all the rna samples used in this study were of good quality despite the long neutrophil isolation procedure. intact rrna subunits of 28s and 18s were observed on both the gel electrophoresis and electrophotogram, indicating that the degradation of the rna was minimal .

expression patterns of the candidate genes in neutrophils
initial screening for the gene expression pattern suggested that the  <dig> candidate housekeeping genes were differentially expressed in neutrophils . based on the band intensity of the pcr products, the two lowest expressed genes, two medium expressed genes and the three highest expressed genes were chosen for real-time pcr analysis. abl <dig>  pbgd and tubb were excluded from further evaluation due to their extremely low expression level.

standard curve and real-time pcr
standard curves were generated by using copy number vs. the threshold cycle . the linear correlation coefficient  of all the seven genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . based on the slopes of the standard curves, the amplification efficiencies of the standards were from 91%~100%, which were derived from the formula e =  <dig> 1/-slope - <dig>  the ct values of all the  <dig> genes in all the unknown samples were within  <dig>  to  <dig>  cycles, covered by the range of the standard curves. electrophoresis analysis of all the amplified products from real-time pcr showed a single band with the expected sizes, and no primer dimer was observed. the dissociation plots provided by the abi prism 7900ht also indicated a single peak in all the reactions.

the stability and expression level of reference genes in the neutrophils
the gene expression levels were measured by real-time pcr, and the expression stabilities were evaluated by the m value of genorm. the ranking of the expression stability in these genes was : gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, b2m, gapd and tbp . the m values of gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, and b2m were lower than  <dig> , and therefore these genes were concluded to be stably expressed housekeeping genes in neutrophils.

a normalization factor  was calculated based on the geometric mean of the copy numbers of these  <dig> selected reference genes in each sample. after normalization against the nf, the ranking of the relative expression levels was : b2m, actb, gapd, rpl <dig>  gnb2l <dig>  tbp, and hprt <dig> .

based on both the expression stability and expression level, our data suggested that b2m and actb can be used as a reference gene for high abundance gene transcripts, rpl <dig> and gnb2l <dig> for medium abundance transcripts, and hprt <dig> for low abundance transcripts in gene expression studies.

discussion
real-time pcr is one of the most sensitive and flexible quantification methods for gene expression analysis. it provides simultaneous measurement of gene expression in many different samples for a number of genes. however, many factors in real-time pcr may affect the results, including the selection of the reference genes. an ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level among different tissues of an organism, at all stages of development, and should be unaffected by the experimental treatment. however, no one single gene is expressed at such a constant level in all these situations  <cit> . for example, actb, gapd, 18s and 28s rrna are the most commonly used reference genes, but a number of studies have provided solid evidence that their transcription levels vary significantly between different individuals, different cell types, different developmental stages, and different experimental conditions  <cit> . therefore, thorough validation of candidate reference genes is critical for accurate analysis of gene expression.

it is also well known that rna quality and quantity are critical for successful gene expression analysis. degraded and inaccurately quantified rna would give misleading results. in this study, the total rna was extracted from isolated human neutrophils, and usually it takes 2â€“ <dig> hours from drawing the blood to obtaining the pure neutrophils. rna degradation is frequently observed. for this reason we performed careful rna analysis by using an agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer  before the gene expression study. the results indicated our rna samples were of good quality. other quantification methods which need a microgram-level of rna were not practical for our study because the amount of rna extracted from the neutrophils from  <dig> ml blood was very limited .

dna contamination is another important factor that affects the accuracy of gene expression analysis. in this study, the following steps were taken to prevent and monitor dna contamination:  rnase-free dnase i treatment on all the rna samples;  the primers were designed to be able to distinguish the pcr product derived from mrna or genomic dna ;  dissociation analysis by abi prism 7900ht;  gel electrophoresis of all the amplified pcr products. with all these precautions in place we were confident that there was no detectable dna contamination. the signal from sybr i was specifically from the desired amplicons, not from artefacts .

for the reasons discussed above, we have confidence that our gene expression results were accurate and reliable, and we further analyzed the expression stability and expression level. the principle that the expression ratio of two ideal reference genes should be identical in all samples is well established. based on this principle we found gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, and b2m were stably expressed in the neutrophils, and they were used for the calculation of a normalization factor . after normalization we found b2m was the most highly expressed, followed by actb, rpl <dig>  gnb2l <dig>  and hprt <dig> was the lowest expressed. as the expression level of the reference genes may be an additional factor for consideration in the process of reference gene selection, this ranking of the relative expression level of the candidate reference genes may be informative for future gene expression studies in neutrophils.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first detailed study of the stability and level of reference gene expression in neutrophils. we found gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, and b2m are good choices for reference gene selection. b2m and actb can be used for high-abundance mrna, rpl <dig> and gnb2l <dig> for medium-abundance mrna, and hprt <dig> for low-abundance mrna in expression studies of neutrophils. for more accurate normalization, as suggested by other authors  <cit> , we recommend a combination of the stably expressed genes gnb2l <dig>  hprt <dig>  rpl <dig>  actb, and b2m as a panel of reference genes for the normalization.
