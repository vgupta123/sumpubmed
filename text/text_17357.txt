BACKGROUND
α-amylase  is an endo-acting enzyme which catalyzes random hydrolysis in the interior of the starch molecules  <cit> . α-amylase has broad applications in various industries including pharmaceutical, detergent, textile, paper, and of course, the food field . in order to meet the increasing demands of biocatalytic tasks, considerable efforts have been made to isolate enzymes produced by organisms living in extreme physicochemical conditions. although numerous mesophilic and thermophilic amylases have been well studied, cold-adapted enzymes, which possess improved catalytic efficiency at low temperatures that compensates for the inherent reduction in reaction rates, still receive little attention. only a few bacterial cold-adapted amylases have been successfully expressed in e. coli  <cit> , but there have been scant studies on enzymes from cold-adapted fungi  <cit> .

fungal amylases are more preferred in the food industry, especially in relation to bread and baking due to their generally recognized as safe status. among them, cold-adapted fungal amylases are particularly used in industrial processes as energy savers. geomyces. pannorum, isolated from victoria land , is a psychrophilic and psychrotolerant saprophytic fungus. it produces abundant cold-adapted α-amylases, indicating its significant role as a desirable candidate in food processing. however, previous studies mainly focused on strain screening and its enzyme-producing ability  <cit> , a rare report intensively researched its biochemical properties and applications.

several attempts have been made to improve the cost-effectiveness of fungal enzymes. immobilization is suggested to be advantageous, since it facilitates the recovery and reuse of the expensive enzymes  <cit> . recently, iron oxide nanoparticles with uniquely large surface-to-volume ratio and quantum size effects provide an economical and convenient method for immobilization and separation of biomacromolecules  <cit> . fe3o4-pva was prepared and applied in immobilization of transaminase  <cit> . fe3o4–κ–carrageenan nanoparticles were produced and adhered to pullulanase  <cit> . nanoparticle fe3o4@sio2–nh <dig> carrier was also developed, and alkaline pectinase was successfully coupled on it  <cit> . a. oryzae α-amylase was also magnetically immobilized, and its parameters for hydrolysis of sweet potato starch were investigated  <cit> . however, the comparison of free and immobilized α-amylase was not studied in detail. thus, we tested the nanoparticles immobilization in order to compare and improve the enzymatic properties and expand the potential value of fungal α-amylase in various industrial applications.

in this study, we constructed an a. oryzae expression system based on the pyrg nutritional selection marker. meanwhile, we reported cloning of a novel fungal, cold-adapted amylase, expressed in a newly constructed a. oryzae system. here, we also examined the recombinant enzyme  in baking by exploring the role of amya <dig> in bread production. furthermore, to widen application of amya <dig>  we immobilized α-amylase onto magnetic nanoparticles, and investigated the detailed biochemical characters.

methods
strains, plasmids, and media

e. coli dh5α  was used for construction and routine propagation of plasmids. aspergillus oryzae auxotrophic host  was derivatived from the wild strain a. oryzae rib <dig>  by gene recombination. geomyces pannorum ak07kgi1001r1- <dig>  was kindly donated by university of malaya  <cit> . the plasmid pane and pbc12anh were preserved in our lab. the pbluescript ii sk  vector was used as the skeleton for constructing expression vectors.

development of fungal transformation system
the Δpyrg strain was initially derived by deleting the orotidine-5-monophosphate decarboxylase gene  through targeted gene replacement  <cit> . subsequently, the Δligd strain was generated by homologous recombination with the pyrg marker gene. then the selected marker pyrg was removed by self-deleting and the ΔpyrgΔligd strain was obtained and used as host for further experiments  <cit> .

a shuttle vector was constructed for expression of recombinant α-amylase in the ΔpyrgΔligd strain. firstly, pbc12anh was used as a template to obtain the elements. fragment i  consisting of a. oryzae α-amylase  promoter, signal peptide and his-tag was amplified using primers fif/fir with kpn i and xho i restriction sites respectively . secondly, fragment ii  including taa terminator and fragment iii  containing the pyrg of a. nidulans were obtained by pcr using pbc12anh and pane as template with primers fiif/fiir and fiiif/fiiir, respectively . after digestion by kpn i/xho i, fragment i was reclaimed and connected with pbluescript ii sk , generating shuttle vector psknh. then psknh was digested with sma i/xba i. the linearized vector psknh, fragment ii and fragment iii were integrated by peasy-uni seamless cloning and assembly kit  to create recombinant expression vector psknhg, which was validated by dna sequencing.table  <dig> primers used in this study

primers amya2f/amya2r , with nhe i and sma i restriction sites respectively, were synthesized to amplify the complete orf of amya <dig> gene. the purified pcr products were digested, reclaimed and cloned into plasmid psknhg, generating recombinant expression vector psknhg-amya <dig>  afterwards, peg-cacl <dig> mediated transformation was completed as previously described  <cit> . transformants were selected according to their growth capability on mm plates, and then confirmed by pcr. transformants were cultured for  <dig> days with an inoculum  in fermentation medium at 20 °c, 200 rpm.

the supernatant was separated by vacuum filtration and subjected to a histrap hp column  pre-equilibrated with buffer a . then the column was washed with 10 ml of buffer a, and 10 ml of buffer b  in order to wash out completely the unbounded protein. subsequently, the target protein amya <dig> was eluted with buffer c . eluted protein showing α-amylase activity was pooled, desalted using desalting column , and determined by enzyme assays and sds-page. protein concentration was calculated by the lowry method using bovine serum albumin  as the standard.

enzyme assays and biochemical characterization
the amylolytic activity was assayed using the dns method  <cit> . the optimum ph and temperature of recombinant α-amylase  was determined by incubating enzyme with 1%  starch in a range of buffers  at 40 °c, or at different temperatures  in  <dig>  m citrate buffer . in order to evaluate the thermostability of amya <dig>  purified α-amylase was incubated at different temperatures . samples were withdrawn at different time intervals and residual enzymatic activity against control was determined. the ph stability was studied by preincubating amya <dig> in various buffers ranging from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  at 30 °c for 30 min. residual activity after incubation was assayed using standard procedures.

to assess the effects of metal ions and chemical reagents on enzymatic activity, amya <dig> was preincubated with the individual reagents in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer  at 30 °c for 60 min. the residual activity was then determined in a standard assay medium. the enzyme with no metal ions was tested as the control. additionally, the purified amya <dig> has been dialyzed at 4 °c for 12 h against 5 mm egta or 5 mm edta, respectively. the residual enzyme activity was checked with or without 5 mm calcium ions. the substrate specificity of amya <dig> was studied using soluble starch, potato starch, maize starch, glycogen, amylopectin, amylose, pullulan and maltooligosaccharides as substrates through the dns method. the hydrolysis products arising from the action of amya <dig> on soluble starch were analyzed by hplc. the conversion was evaluated on series  <dig> hplc system  using an nh <dig> column , eluting with acetonitrile/water  at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min. the average of triplicate measurements was used as each value.

max values of the purified amya <dig> toward soluble starch were determined by lineweaver-burk double reciprocal plot at ph  <dig> , 40 °c.

effects of amya <dig> on bread quality
the dough mixture was added with the enzyme preparation  in a ratio of  <dig> u/g of dough. the flour and enzyme were manually mixed for 20 min until homogeneous dough was achieved  <cit> . control dough was prepared without the addition of enzyme. afterwards, doughs were kept for panning and proofing for 75 min at 38 °c and 85% relative humidity. baking was performed in electric oven for 20 min at 180 °c  and 200 °c . subsequently, bread loaves were cooled at room temperature and packaged in polyethylene bags. the crumb texture of the loaves  was measured by texture profile analysis  on a texture analyzer  using a 35 mm flat-end plate with an aluminum compression disk . an acrylic cylindrical probe was used to compress the samples  by 40% of their original height  at a speed of 1 mm/s, with a 30 s delay between the 1st and 2nd compression. all values are means from three independent experiments.

magnetic immobilization of amya1
magnetic nanoparticles  were synthesized by the solvothermal method  <cit> . briefly,  <dig>  m fecl <dig> and  <dig>  m feso <dig> were dissolved in 100 ml ultrapure water and blended together. the solution was vigorously stirred with drop wise addition of 50 ml of 10% naoh until black precipitates were obtained. the resultant precipitates were washed a couple of times using ultrapure water and separated by magnetic decantation. precipitates were dispersed in 50 ml tris-hcl buffer  and ultrasonicated for 15 min, after which large precipitates were removed. α-amylase was mixed with dried ionps in the ratio of 1: <dig> in phosphate buffer  and shook for 30 min. gluteraldehyde  was then added and shaken continually for 2 h. finally, the amya1-ionps were collected through magnetic decantation.

RESULTS
cloning and sequence analysis of the α-amylase gene from g. pannorum
based upon the genome sequence of geomyces  pannorum vkm f- <dig> , the amya <dig> gene, encoding a putative α-amylase, was obtained from g. pannorum 1- <dig>  the cdna of amya <dig> consisted of  <dig> nucleotides, corresponding to a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues . comparing the genomic dna  and cdna of amya <dig>  two introns with lengths of  <dig> and 56 bp were identified, which are less than that of mesophilic α-amylases such as α-amylase  from a. oryzae containing  <dig> introns. however, the gu-ag classical rule of exon/intron splice junctions in filamentous fungi was strictly followed.

according to the homology search of the deduced amino acid sequences by blast, amya <dig> attaches to the gh  <dig> family of glycoside hydrolase. it shares the highest amino acid identity of 66% with that from geomyces pannorum , and only  <dig> and 44% identity with the α-amylases from lipomyces kononenkoae  and aspergillus kawachii , respectively, suggesting that amya <dig> is a novel α-amylase .fig.  <dig> multiple-sequence alignment of amino acids of amya <dig>  the sequences of the mature proteins from g. pannorum , lipomyces kononenkoae , aspergillus kawachii ifo  <dig> , neofusicoccum parvum ucrnp <dig> , penicillium sp. 3- <dig>  have been aligned by introducing gaps to maximize the similarity. regions  are the four conserved sequence regions within α-amylase family. the structures are denoted as follows: three proposed catalytic residues , the potential active sites for substrate binding 




visual inspection of the alignment indicated seven common conserved regions  associated with catalytic activity and characteristics the of α-amylase family   <cit> . the first  <dig> residues of amya <dig> encoding a potential canonical signal peptide coincides with the prediction online. the putative catalytic active site asp <dig>  glu <dig>  and asp <dig> are correlated well with those in the α-amylase family. the calculated pi/mw of the amya <dig> was estimated to be  <dig> / <dig>  and  <dig> / <dig>  for the native protein  and mature peptide, respectively.

expression and purification of amya <dig> in a. oryzae
the a. oryzae auxotrophic host  was obtained by homologous recombination and used as the host. the general vector designed for heterologous protein expression was then constructed . the produced vector, psknhg, contained a complete expression cassette together with a signal peptide, his-tag and pyrg gene as the selectable marker. the expression vector psknhg harboring the amya <dig> gene was introduced into the ΔpyrgΔligd strain. the positive transformants were fermented at 20 °c and a superior strain  was selected by enzymatic activity assay. the recombinant α-amylase was purified by affinity chromatography and the purified enzyme showed a clear band of 52 kda according to sds-page analysis , which is similar to that of taa . the specific activity of purified amya <dig> was  <dig>  ×  <dig> u/ml. the kinetic parameters were evaluated, and the k
m and v
max values of purified amya <dig> were  <dig>  mg/ml and  <dig>  × 10− <dig> mg/ towards soluble starch, respectively.

biochemical characterization of amya1
the temperature activity and stability profiles of the purified amya <dig> are illustrated in fig. 2a and b. the enzyme was optimally active at 40 °c and exhibited over 20% of its maximal activity at 0–20 °c. the activity declined sharply when temperature exceeded 50 °c. amya <dig> maintained over 70% of initial activity after incubation at 40 °c for more than 30 min, while losing most activity when incubated above 50 °c. the optimum ph of amya <dig> was determined over a ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . according to the ph-activity profile shown in fig. 2c, maximum activity was observed at ph  <dig>  and more than 70% activity was retained at ph  <dig> – <dig> . amya <dig> was relatively stable during treatment in neutral and basic buffers. the residual activities were nearly 80% of the control value after incubated in the ph range of  <dig> – <dig>  for 30 min .fig.  <dig> effect of temperature and ph on purified recombinant α-amylase. a temperature dependence of amya1; b thermostability of amya <dig>  incubation at 40 °c , 50 °c , 60 °c . c relative activity profile of amya <dig> at different ph conditions; d relative stability of amya <dig> at different ph conditions. the values shown are the means of three independent experiments and the error bars represent the standard deviations




the effects of different metal ions and reagents at a final concentration of 5 mm and  <dig> %  on amya <dig> activity were analyzed . the activity was slightly enhanced by ca2+, mg2+, and mildly decreased by edta, which was not consistent with previous reports that most α-amylases require calcium or magnesium for activity or stability  <cit> . additionally, the catalytic efficiency of amya <dig> was negligibly effected in the presence of zn2+, cu2+, and slightly inhibited by co2+, mn2+, fe2+, and isopropanol, dmso , but strongly reduced by ni2+, tween- <dig>  tween- <dig>  triton x- <dig>  and methanol. moreover, the activity of dialyzed amya <dig> was investigated with or without ca2+. in accordance with our previous result, edta and egta did not affect the activity of amya <dig> significantly, and ca2+ had mildly effect on the enzymatic activity .table  <dig> effect of different metal ions and chemical reagents on recombinant amya1

the hydrolyzed products were detected by hplc with standard sugar solutions. as presented in fig. 3a, the soluble starch was converted into glucose, maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose and maltopentaose. during the early phase of the reaction ,  <dig> %  glucose,  <dig> % maltose,  <dig> % maltotriose,  <dig> % maltotetraose and  <dig> % maltopentaose were obtained, demonstrating that amya <dig> preferentially cleaves at the internal a- <dig>  linkage between adjoining glucose units. as the reaction time prolonged, the amount of glucose, maltose and maltotriose increased, but the amount of maltopentaose decreased. interestingly, the amount of maltotriose almost stayed the same . the highest hydrolysis yield of  <dig> % was achieved at 48 h, and the soluble starch was catalyzed into glucose, maltose and maltotetraose accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % respectively. subsequently, different substrates were tested to confirm the type of amylases of amya <dig>  the catalytic rate enhanced according to the increase in substrate length, indicating a higher affinity for longer substrates. besides, hplc analysis illustrated that amya <dig> could hydrolyze different polysaccharides and maltooligosaccharides into glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and small amounts of maltotetraose and maltopentaose . these data confirmed that amya <dig> was an α-amylase.fig.  <dig> hplc analysis of end products catalyzed by amya <dig> on soluble starch.  reaction time: 1 h  and 48 h ; control: reaction for 48 h without amya <dig> ; standards: glucose , maltose , maltotriose , maltotetraose , maltopentaose . the retention time of major peaks represented glucose , maltose , maltotriose , maltotetraose , maltopentaose  respectively;  effect of reaction time on hydrolysis products, abbreviations: g <dig> , glucose; g <dig> , maltose; g <dig> , maltotriose; g <dig> , maltotetraose, g <dig> , maltopentaose

effects of amya <dig> on bread
acidic amylases, which could produce fermentable sugars and dextrin for further use by yeast, are applied in the baking industry to improve bread quality. supplementation of amya <dig> and taa had a significant effect on bread, which is clearly visible in the bread slices . in comparison with the control, addition of amya <dig> and taa improved bread specific volume of  <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively. besides, crumb structure was more uniform with homogeneous small cells when adding amya <dig>  the quality of bread was illustrated directly by tpa evaluation . these mechanical characteristics are correlated well with the sensory perception of bread and can define bread quality  <cit> . table  <dig> shows that significant changes were observed in all the tested parameters of bread: the hardness and springiness increased notably, the cohesiveness increased by  <dig> %, and the gumminess decreased by  <dig> % as compared with the control. in particular, the effect was more pronounced with amya <dig> than that of taa, indicating the potential value of amya <dig> in the food and starch fields.fig.  <dig> crumb structure of the loaf supplemented with: control  ; amya <dig> ; α-amylase taa from a. oryzae

magnetic immobilization and characterization of amya1
magnetic separation of the amya1-ionps aggregates was achieved by placing a magnet adjacent to a vial, in which the immobilized enzyme was suspended . the amya1-ionps were completely accumulated near to the magnet within 5 s, and the solution became clear and transparent, demonstrating the simple and rapid method to effectively collect aggregated immobilized enzyme and reuse. in addition, removal of the magnet followed by agitation resulted in resuspension of the aggregates.fig.  <dig> 
a amya <dig> immobilized on pretreated ionps; b amya1-ionps under magnetic field




the surface characteristics of magnetically immobilized amya <dig> were investigated by sem . most of the magnetite particles obtained have a nearly spherical shape and uniform size. the diameter of the spheres was generally under 100 nm. the surface of amya1-ionps was found to be porous in nature, which might reinforce the catalytic activity of α-amylase. results of eds analysis illustrated the elemental composition of amya1-ionps as shown in fig. 6b. the presence of carbon, oxygen and iron was confirmed, proving the magnetic effect of the nanocomposite of amya <dig>  the identification of material phases was studied by xrd analysis . six high peaks in the diffraction angles of  <dig> °,  <dig> °,  <dig> °,  <dig> °,  <dig> °, and  <dig> °, mirrored typical fe3o <dig> crystal plane , demonstrating the pure inversed spinel fe3o <dig> and crystalline amya1-ionps in structure. the average diameter of the crystal plane was about 40 nm, which was calculated by debye-scherrer formular  <cit> .fig.  <dig>  sem analysis of ionps and amya1-ionps ;  eds analysis of ionps and amya1-ionps ;  xrd analysis of ionps and amya1-ionps




the effect of temperature on the activity and stability of free and immobilized amya <dig> was investigated. both free and amya1-ionps had an optimal temperature of 40 °c. however, the immobilized enzyme showed comparatively higher activity when the temperature increased or decreased. the amya1-ionps kept more than 40% of the optimal activity at  <dig> and 70 °c, whereas the free amya <dig> maintained only  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively . the stability of free and immobilized amya <dig> at various temperatures suggested that amya1-ionps were obviously more stable than free amya <dig> after being incubated at temperatures ranging 20–60 °c for 2 h . the magnetic immobilized α-amylase retained nearly 20% of the optimal activity at 60 °c, but the free amya <dig> lost its activity within 15 min. the effect of ph was also investigated. the immobilized amya <dig> exhibited higher activity in neutral and basic conditions, with an optimal ph of  <dig> – <dig> , which is higher than that of free amya <dig>  . meanwhile, amya1-ionps displayed better ph tolerance and maintained its vitality slightly better .fig.  <dig>

discussion
alpha-amylase, one of the most versatile enzymes, holds a large market share with applications in a broad range of industrial processes. diverse α-amylases from various genera have already been cloned and well characterized. to date, cold-adapted amylases from bacteria have drawn attention, such as thermolabile α-amylase from pseudoalteromonas arctica and cold-adapted α-amylase from alteromonas haloplanctis  <cit> . however, the amylases from psychrophilic fungi have been poorly investigated at the molecular level. g. pannorum, a psychrotolerant fungus thriving in antarctica, secretes many kinds of hydrolytic enzymes, like amylase, protease, cellulase, and esterase. in this work, a cold-adapted amylase gene amya <dig> was successfully cloned from g. pannorum r1- <dig>  sequence analysis showed that amya <dig> shares relatively low homology with α-amylase from other genera, revealing its research significance as a novel enzyme.

note that no enzymatic activity was detected when amya <dig> was expressed in e. coli and pichia pastoris. however, amya <dig> was functionally heterologous expressed in a. oryzae and efficiently secreted into the medium, demonstrating that the a. oryzae system we constructed has distinct advantages for fungal genes expression. subsequently, the amya <dig> was purified for enzymatic properties exploration. similar to fungal α-amylases from a. oryzae, a. niger, and rhizopus oryzae, amya <dig> exhibited the highest activity at neutral environment  with a sharp peak in ph curve. generally, lower optimum temperature and greater thermosensitivity than most reported fungal amylases indicate broad potential in industrial applications, such as additives in processed food, waste-water treatment, cold-washing detergents, cold-climate bioremediation, molecular-biological applications. the optimum temperature of amya <dig> is slightly lower than that of other α-amylases, and its thermolabile feature  are consistent with the cold-adapted amylases  <cit> , thus providing an opportunity of amya <dig> for further use. it is worth mentioning that the wild strain g. pannorum r1- <dig> could not present α-amylase activity above 30 °c, but the amya <dig> showed its optimum temperature at 40–50 °c, indicating the abundant enzyme reserves of microorganism, and its powerful resistance to harsh environment.

generally, the main products of starch catalyzed by fungal α-amylase were maltose with a small amount of glucose  <cit> . however, our study revealed a high-degradation rate and high-glucose product catalyzed by amya <dig>  which could simplify the syrup industry by eliminating the saccharification process. meanwhile, amya <dig> also produced abundant maltotriose as well as certain amounts of maltotetraose and maltopentaose, suggesting that amya <dig> could serve as a potential candidate for functional oligosaccharide production. in addition, substrate specificity experiments demonstrated that amya <dig> had broad substrate scope and could act on diverse kinds of starch. note that amya <dig> could catalyze glycogen effectively, which is distinct from other α-amylases  <cit> .

nowadays, bread quality received a particular attention on account of its high consumption. thus considerable efforts have given rise to improve breads that combine health benefits with good sensory properties. for instant, addition of glycogen branching enzyme led to bread volume increase, while adding esterase resulted in a decreased bread volume  <cit> . the water and sucrose src values of flour reduced with the increasing level of endoxylanases  <cit> . amylase action and properties also significantly affect starch structure in bread. the supplementation of bacillus subtilis α-amylase caused an increase in hardness, gumminess, and a decrease in springiness, cohesiveness  <cit> . in comparison, addition of amya <dig> led to decrease in gumminess and increase in springiness and cohesiveness, which favor better bread quality. furthermore, lower optimum temperature, greater thermosensitivity, and its neutral optimal ph indicate that amya <dig> would be more favored in the baking industry or related applications, because its characteristics coincide well with the condition of dough fermentation  <cit> .

easy separation and repeated reuse perform significant roles in utilization of enzymes. recently, a convenient and economical method using iron oxide nanoparticles is thriving for separation of biomacromolecules  <cit> . several successful applications on proteins as well as cells were reported . in order to expand the potential value of this enzyme in other areas, the purified fungal α-amylase amya <dig> was efficiently immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles and the characteristics of immobilized amya <dig> were investigated. the amya1-ionps displayed more stability than free amya <dig>  mainly due to the fact that ionps made the conformation of α-amylase more rigid and lead to less denaturation of protein. moreover, fixing the enzyme on a matrix could also decrease the protein autolysis  <cit> . compared with the free enzyme, the immobilized enzyme exhibited better ph tolerance and stability under neutral conditions. this notable shift of optimum ph may be owing to the difference between h+ and oh− concentrations in the microenvironment, which is formed by the electrostatic interactions with the carrier  <cit> . meanwhile, the binding interaction between ionps and amya <dig> could reduce drastic conformational changes during ph shifting  <cit> . the magnetically immobilized amya <dig> can be effectively separated, recovered and reused for maximum utilization. the immobilized α-amylase showed good stability over cycles and 60% of its initial hydrolytic activity was retained after the eighth cycle. the favorable stability and longer service life of the magnetically immobilized amya <dig> provide an opportunity for large-scale application and cost reduction.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented study described the gene cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of a novel α-amylase from antarctic mycelial fungus g. pannorum. the detailed report of the enzymatic properties of amya <dig> gives new insights into fungal cold-adapted amylase. moreover, different application prospects of α-amylase are investigated. application study showed the potential value of amya <dig> in traditional baking and food industry. by the means of magnetic immobilization, the improved thermostability and favorable reusability of amya <dig> could potentially support industrial production.
