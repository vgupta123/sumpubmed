BACKGROUND
to defend attack from potential pathogens, plants have evolved to possess multilayer of immune responses  <cit> . the first layer is triggered upon the detection of pathogen- or microbial-associated molecular patterns  by pattern recognition receptors on the external face of plant cells and is called pamp-triggered immunity   <cit> . to circumvent pti, pathogens evolve to produce a large number of effectors, which are delivered into plant cells to suppress pti and facilitate pathogenesis  <cit> . as a counter measure, plants have acquired additional intracellular receptors called resistance  proteins to recognize pathogen effectors, resulting in initiation of the second layer of defense, known as effector-triggered immunity  . generally, eti is quantitatively stronger and longer-lasting than pti; however, initiation of both pti and eti often requires expression reprogramming of a plenty of genes . recently, extensive genetic and biochemical studies have shown that ubiquitin-mediated protein modification plays critical roles in plant immune responses .

ubiquitin-mediated protein modification has been demonstrated to play critical roles in regulation of growth, development, senescence , abiotic stress responses  <cit> , hormone signaling , and immune responses against pathogens . ubiquitination can be classified into two major types, namely monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination, depending on whether a single ubiquitin moiety or a polymerized ubiquitin chain is attached to target proteins  <cit> . polyubiquitination generally leads to the degradation of the target proteins through the 26s proteasome  <cit>  while monoubiquitination of target proteins does not lead to degradation by the proteasome. instead, monoubiquitination functions as an endogenous signal  <cit> .

histone monoubiquitination together with other types of posttranslational modifications can modulate nucleosome/chromatin structure and dna accessibility and thus regulate diverse dna-dependent processes . monoubiquitinated histone h2b  was detected widely throughout eukaryotes spanning from yeast to humans and plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, h2bub <dig> is associated with active genes distributed throughout the genome and marks chromatin regions notably in combination with histone h <dig> trimethylated on k <dig>  and/or with h3k36me <dig>  <cit> . during early photomorphogenesis, gene upregulation was found to be associated with h2bub <dig> enrichment  <cit> . recent studies have suggested the involvement of histone monoubiquitination <dig> - and athub2-mediated histone h2b monoubiquitination in arabidopsis growth and development. it has been demonstrated that athub <dig> and athub <dig> act nonredundantly in the same pathway and play important roles in regulation of early leaf and root growth  <cit> , cuticle composition  <cit> , seed dormancy  <cit> , vegetative and reproductive development  <cit> , photomorphogenesis  <cit> , flowering and floral transition .

it was recently demonstrated that the histone h2b monoubiquitination acts as an important type of chromatin modifications with regulatory roles in plant immune responses. the arabidopsis athub <dig> mutant plants showed increased susceptibility to botrytis cinerea and alternaria brassicicola, two typical necrotrophic fungal pathogens, but did not alter the response to pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  dc <dig>  <cit> . both of athub <dig> and athub <dig> mediated histone h2b monoubiquitination directly at snc <dig>  the suppressor of npr1- <dig>  constitutive <dig> gene, and loss of athub <dig> or athub <dig> function reduced the upregulation of snc <dig> expression and suppressed the bon <dig> autoimmune phenotypes  <cit> . it was found that the function of athub <dig> was independent on jasmonate, but ethylene  responses and salicylic acid  was involved in the resistance of athub <dig> mutants to necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . furthermore, athub <dig> interacted with atmed <dig>  a subunit of the arabidopsis mediator complex, and rnai-mediated supression of atmed <dig> expression also led to increased susceptibility to b. cinerea and a. brassicicola, suggesting an essential role for atmed <dig> in athub1-mediated immune response against necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . more recently, it was also shown that athub <dig> and athub <dig> are involved in plant defense response to verticillium dahliae toxins through modulating the dynamics of microtubule  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined the involvement of the tomato slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  orthologues of the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig>  in disease resistance against b. cinerea and explored the possible molecular mechanisms. we found that virus-induced gene silencing  of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> in tomato plants resulted in increased susceptibility to b. cinerea and led to thinner cell wall, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species  and callose around the infection sites, demonstrating that both of the slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are positive regulators of defense response against b. cinerea most likely through modulation of cell wall strengthen and ros balance. although slmed <dig>  a subunit of the mediator complex, interacted with slhub <dig>  silencing of slmed <dig> did not affect the disease resistance response to b. cinerea, indicating a different mechanism for the function of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in defense response against b. cinerea from that for athub <dig> in arabidopsis.

methods
plant growth, treatments and disease assays
tomato  cv. suhong  <dig> was used for most of the experiments in this study except that cv. microtom was used for the whole plant inoculation assays. seeds were scarified on moist filter paper in petri dishes for 3 days and then transferred into a mixture of perlite: vermiculite: plant ash . tomato plants were grown in a growth room under fluorescent light  at 22 ~ 24 °c with 60 % relative humidity in a 14 h light/10 h dark regime. for analysis of gene expression, 4-week-old tomato plants were treated by foliar spraying with 10 μm methyl jasmonate , 100 μm 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid , 100 μm sa or water as a control and samples were collected at indicated time points after treatment.

inoculation of b. cinerea was performed using two different methods, whole plant inoculation and detached leaf inoculation, as previously described . briefly, b. cinerea was grown on 2 × v <dig> agar  at 22 °c and spores were collected and resuspended in 1 % maltose buffer to 2 ×  <dig> spores/ml for the whole plant inoculation and 1 ×  <dig> spores/ml for the detached leaf inoculation. the concentrations of spore suspension were widely used in previously reported studies . in the whole plant inoculation assays, 4-week-old plants were inoculated by foliar spraying with spore suspension or buffer. in the detached leaf inoculation assays, fully expanded leaves were inoculated by dropping 5 μl of spore suspension onto leaf surface. the inoculated leaves and plants were kept in a humidity condition by covering with plastic film in trays or tans at 22 °c to facilitate disease development. leaf samples were collected from the whole plant inoculation assays at different time points after inoculation for analysis of gene expression and in planta fungal growth. fungal growth was measured by qrt-pcr analyzing the transcript of b. cinerea actina gene as a growth indicative  <cit>  using a pair of primers bcactin-f and bcactin-r . disease in the detached leaf inoculation assays was estimated by measuring the lesion sizes.

disease assays for pst dc <dig> were done as described previously  <cit> . pst dc <dig> was grown overnight in king’s b liquid medium and resuspended in 10 mm mgcl <dig> at od600 =  <dig> . four-week-old plants were vacuum infiltrated with bacteria suspensions and then kept in a growth chamber with high humidity. for measurement of bacterial growth curve, leaf punches from six individual plants were surface sterilized in 70 % ethanol for 10 s, homogenized in 200 μl of 10 mm mgcl <dig>  diluted in 10 mm mgcl <dig>  and plated on kb agar plates containing 100 μg/ml rifampicin. colonies were counted after incubation at 28 °c for 3 days.

rapid amplification of cdna end  experiments were carried out using the smarter race cdna amplification kit  with nested primers  to obtain the 5’ end sequence information. the race products were cloned by t/a cloning into pmd19-t vector  and sequenced. based on the sequencing results, pairs of gene-specific primers were designed  and the full-length cdnas of slhub <dig>  slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> were amplified and cloned into vector pmd19-t, yielding plasmids pmd19-slhub <dig>  pmd19-slhub <dig> and pmd19-slmed <dig>  respectively. these plasmids were confirmed by sequencing and used for all experiments described below.

construction of vectors and vigs assays
fragments of 300-400 bp in sizes for slhub <dig>  slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> were amplified using gene-specific primers  from pmd19-slhub <dig>  pmd19-slhub <dig> and pmd19-slmed <dig>  respectively, and were cloned into ptrv <dig> vector  <cit> , yielding ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> and ptrv2-slmed <dig>  these constructs were then introduced into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain gv <dig> by electroporation using gene pulser ii electroporation system . agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-gus , ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-slmed <dig> were grown in yep medium  for 24 h with continuous shaking at 28 °c. cells were centrifuged and resuspended in infiltration buffer . agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-gus, ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-slmed <dig> were mixed with agrobacteria carrying ptrv <dig> in a ratio of 1: <dig> and adjusted to od600 =  <dig> . the mixed agrobacteria suspension was infiltrated into the abaxial surface of 2-week-old seedlings using a 1 ml needleless syringe. efficiency of the silencing protocol was examined using phytoene desaturase  gene as a marker of silencing in tomato plants according to the protocol described previously  <cit> .

purification of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> protein
the coding sequences of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> were amplified using gene-specific primers  and cloned into pet-32a  at noti and xhoi sites. meanwhile, truncated mutants slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring with deletion of the ring domain in slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  respectively, were amplified using gene-specific primers  and cloned into pet-32a at noti and xhoi sites. the slhub <dig>  slhub <dig>  slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring fusion proteins were expressed in the e. coli rosetta cells  and induced by 1 mm isopropyl-a-thiogalactoside at 30 °c for 4-6 h. the his-tagged slhub <dig>  slhub <dig>  slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring fusion proteins were purified using ni-nta his-bind resin following the manufacturer’s protocols . the purified proteins were refolded by dialysis in a refolding buffer  at 4 °c for 2 days. protein concentration was determined with the bio-rad protein assay kit .

in vitro histone monoubiquitination assay
assays for in vitro monoubiquitination were performed as described previously  <cit> . briefly, the refolded proteins were incubated with  <dig>  μg e <dig> ,  <dig>  μg rad <dig> , 10 μg ubiquitin proteins  and 1 μg recombinant h2b  in 30 μl buffer . reactions were incubated at 37 °c for 3 h and then terminated by adding sds-page loading buffer, followed by separation on a  <dig>  % sds-page. signals were detected by immunoblotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody , followed by chemiluminescence with the ecl kit  according to the manufacture’s recommendations.

yeast two-hybrid assays
interactions between slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> were examined using the matchmaker gold yeast two-hybrid system according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the coding sequences of slhub <dig>  slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> were amplified using gene-specific primers  from pmd19-slhub <dig>  pmd19-slhub <dig> and pmd19-slmed <dig>  respectively, and cloned into pgadt <dig> and pgbkt <dig> vectors. the resultant plasmids were transformed into yeast strains y <dig> and y2hgold and confirmed by colony pcr. the transformed yeasts were cultivated on sd/trp− and sd/trp−his− medium for 3 days at 30 °c, followed by addition of x-α-gal . interactions between slhub1/slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> were evaluated according to the growth situation of the transformed yeast cells on the sd/trp−his− medium and production of blue pigments after the addition of x-α-gal. co-transformation of pgbkt7- <dig> and pgadt7-t were as a positive control.

detection of ros accumulation
detection of h2o <dig> and superoxide anion in leaf tissues were conducted according to previously described procedures  <cit> . for staining of h2o <dig>  samples were dipped into  <dig>  3-diaminobenzidine   solution  and incubated for 8 h in the dark at room temperature. for staining of superoxide anion, leaves were dipped into the 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer  containing 10 mm nan <dig> and  <dig>  % nitroblue tetrazolium   for 1 h at room temperature. to remove the chlorophyll, leaves were placed into 95 % ethanol and boiled in a water bath, followed by several changes of the solution. the leaves were then maintained in 50 % ethanol and the accumulation of h2o <dig> and superoxide anion in leaves was photographed using a digital camera.

callose staining
callose staining was performed as describe previously  <cit> . leaves were cleared in alcoholic lactophenol solution for 30 min at 65 °c, transferred to fresh alcoholic lactophenol solution and then incubated overnight at room temperature. cleared leaves were rinsed briefly in 50 % ethanol, then water, and stained with  <dig>  % aniline blue  in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer for 45 min in the dark, followed by washing with fresh sodium phosphate buffer. the leaf samples were examined under a leica ctr <dig> microscopy  with an excitation filter of 365 ± 25 nm, a 400-nm dichroic mirror and a 450-nm longpass emission filter and callose deposits were visualized as light blue spots against a dark blue background  <cit> . pictures showing callose deposits surrounding the infection sites were taken at a similar exposure. the quantification of callose in inoculated tissue was done using imagej software . the same threshold defining a fluorescent and a nonfluorescent area was used for all the infected samples and controls, respectively. the area  showing fluorescence in the infected tissue above the mock-inoculated control was calculated.

transmission electron microscopy

RESULTS
identification of tomato slhub <dig> and slhub2
to characterize putative orthologues of arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> in tomato, we performed blastp searches against the tomato genomic database  using the amino acid sequences of athub <dig> and athub <dig> proteins as queries and obtained three predicted loci  with high levels of sequence similarity or identity. further analyses led to the identification of the locus solyc11g <dig> as putative slhub <dig> whereas both of the predicted loci solyc01g <dig> and solyc01g <dig> as putative slhub <dig>  the full-length cdnas of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> were cloned and confirmed by sequencing. slhub <dig> encodes an  <dig> amino acid protein while slhub <dig> encodes an  <dig> amino acid protein. sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the tomato slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> show 56–76 % of identity to yeast bre <dig>  <cit> , human rnf <dig> and rnf <dig>  <cit>  and arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig>  <cit>  , and both of them contain a conserved c3hc <dig> ring domain at c-terminus  . therefore, the cloned slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are putative arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> orthologues in tomato.fig.  <dig> slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are functional histone h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligases. a phylogenetic tree analysis of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> with yeast bre , arabidopsis athub <dig>  and athub <dig> , and human rfn <dig>  and rfn <dig> . sequence alignment was performed using clustalx  <dig>  program and phylogenic tree was created and visualized using mega  <dig> . b amino acid alignments of the slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> ring domains with ring domains of the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> and yeast bre. filled triangles indicate the conserved cysteine residues, while asterisk indicates conserved histidine residue. c recombinant slhub <dig>  and slhub <dig>  proteins have histone h2b monoubiquitination activity in vitro. recombinant slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> and their mutants slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring were incubated with e <dig> enzyme, e <dig> enzyme , h2b substrate and ubiquitin, separated on sds-page and detected by western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody. the absences of each one of h2b, e <dig>  e <dig> or ubiquitin were included as negative controls



slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> had histone h2b monoubiquitination activity in vitro
to determine whether slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> have histone h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligase activity, the slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> were expressed prokaryotically and the recombinant his-tagged slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> proteins were purified. to examine the importance of the ring domain in e <dig> ligase activity, truncated mutants of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring, in which the ring domains were deleted, were also generated . in the presence of histone 2b, e <dig> enzyme, e <dig>  enzyme and ubiquitin  <cit> , both of the recombinant slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> could ubiquitinate the histone 2b, as revealed by the two bands of ~ <dig> kd and ~ <dig> kd, responsible for free ubiquitin and ubiquitinated histone, respectively, that were reactive to ubiquitin-specific antibody, while only one ~ <dig> kd bind, referring to free ubiquitin in the reactions, was detected in the absence of e <dig>  e <dig>  or slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> . the truncated mutants, slhub1Δring and slhub2Δring, did not show e <dig> ligase activity in the reactions . these results indicate that both of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> act as functional histone h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligases and that the ring domains in slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are essential to their histone h2b monoubiquitination activity.

expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> was induced by pathogens and hormones
to explore the possible roles of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in tomato disease resistance, we first analyzed the expression patterns of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in response to pathogens and defense signaling-related hormones. the expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in mock-inoculated plants maintained unchanged during the experimental period . however, the expression levels of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> increased after b. cinerea infection, showing approximately 4-fold increases over that in mock-inoculated plants at 48 h after inoculation . similar expression dynamics of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> were also observed in plants inoculated with pst dc <dig> but the induction was much faster than that in b. cinerea-inoculated plants . the expression levels of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> increased markedly at 24 h and showed further increases at 48 h after inoculation, leading to ~3-fold of increases over that in the mock-inoculated plants, although increases of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> expression were also observed at 48 h in mock-inoculated plants . the expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> was induced at different levels by the defense signaling-related hormones. sa drastically induced the expressions of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  showing ~10-fold and  <dig> -fold of increases for slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  respectively, over those in the control plants at 12 h after treatment . the expression level of slhub <dig> in acc-treated plants showed  <dig> -fold of increase at 24 h after treatment over that in the control plants whereas the expression levels of slhub <dig> were increased significantly in the acc-treated plants, giving  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -folds of increases over those in the control plants at  <dig> and 24 h after treatment . however, no significant induction in the expression levels of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> was observed after treatment with ja, as compared with the expression in the control plants . these results indicate that the expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> can be induced by b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> and by defense signaling-related hormones, such as sa, ja and acc.fig.  <dig> expression of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in responses to pathogens and defense signaling-related hormones. four-week-old plants were inoculated by spore suspension of b. cinerea , vacuum-infiltrated by suspension of pst dc <dig>  or treated by foliar spraying with 1 mm sa, 100 μm meja, 100 μm acc solutions or sterilized distill water as a control . leaf samples were collected at indicated time points after treatment. relative expression was shown as folds of the actin transcript values. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> resulted in increased susceptibility to b. cinerea
to explore the possible function of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in disease resistance to b. cinerea, we used the trv-based gene silencing system to knockdown the expression levels of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> in tomato plants and compared the phenotype between the silenced and the control plants after infection with b. cinerea. in our standard vigs experiments, the vigs procedure efficiency was confirmed as >80 %, as judged by the appearance of bleaching phenotype in the ptrv-pds-infiltrated plants . using the standard vigs procedure, the silencing efficiency was estimated, by comparison of the transcript levels in the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, respectively, to be ~80 % for slhub <dig> and ~70 % for slhub <dig> . importantly, the transcript levels of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants, respectively, were comparable to those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, indicating that silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> did not affect the expression of another one. only when vigs procedure efficiency was >80 % in the same batch and the silencing efficiency for the target genes  was >70 %, the ptrv-slhub1- or ptrv-slhub2-infiltrated plants were used for all experiments at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration.fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> resulted in reduced resistance to b. cinerea. two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-gus constructs and disease assays were carried out at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. a silencing efficiency of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in vigs construct-infiltrated plants. the transcript levels of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> in ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were analyzed by qrt-pcr and compared to that in ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, which was set  <dig>  b, d disease phenotype  and lesion size  on detached leaves of ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after drop-inoculation with b. cinerea, respectively. photographs were taken at 4 days post-inoculation . lesion sizes were measured at  <dig> dpi and on a minimum of  <dig> leaves in each experiment. c, e disease phenotype  and fungal growth  of ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after spraying with b. cinerea, respectively. photographs were taken at  <dig> dpi. growth of b. cinerea in planta was measured at  <dig> dpi by analyzing the transcript level of bcactina gene with the slactin gene as an internal control. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



we first examined whether silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> affected the disease resistance against b. cinerea in tomato. detached leaf assays were first performed with fully expanded leaves collected from the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants. under our disease assay conditions, typical disease symptoms, e.g. necrotic lesions, were observed in the leaves from the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants at  <dig> dpi; however, the lesions in the leaves from the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants expanded rapidly and were larger than those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . at  <dig> dpi, the lesion sizes in the leaves from the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were measured as  <dig>  mm and  <dig>  mm in average, respectively, leading to  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of increases over that in the ptrv-gus-infiltrated plants  . whole plant inoculation assays were also performed to confirm the results obtained from the detached leaf inoculation assays. as shown in fig. 3c, the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated cv. microtom plants suffered much serious disease as compared with the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated cv. microtom plants and, at 6 days after inoculation, approximately 90 % of the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants died while most of the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants were still alive. quantification of in planta fungal growth by qrt-pcr analysis of the transcript of the b. cinerea bcactina gene as indicative of the growth rate showed that the fungal biomass, as judged by the folds of bcactina/slactin in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants was significantly higher than that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, leading to  <dig>  and  <dig>  folds of increases, respectively . collectively, these data indicate that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> attenuated the disease resistance in tomato against b. cinerea and thus demonstrate that both of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are required for resistance against b. cinerea in tomato.

slmed <dig> interacted with slhub <dig> but silencing of slmed <dig> did not affect the resistance to b. cinerea
in arabidopsis, atmed <dig> was shown to interact strongly with athub <dig> and have a function in the defense response against necrotrophic fungal pathogens  <cit> . we therefore cloned slmed <dig>  a tomato orthologue of arabidopsis atmed <dig> gene , and examined whether tomato slmed <dig> also can interact with slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> and thus play a role in resistance to b. cinerea. in our yeast two-hybrid assays, a strong interaction between slmed <dig> and slhub <dig> was detected when the slhub <dig> in the bait vector  and slmed <dig> in the prey vector  were co-expressed in yeast. when co-expressed with the pad or pbd empty vector, neither slhub <dig> nor slmed <dig> activated the transcription of reporter genes, indicating that slhub <dig> or slmed <dig> does not have autoactivation activity. in addition, no significant interaction between slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> was detected . we next examined whether slmed <dig> plays a role in resistance against b. cinerea by the vigs-based functional analysis. the silencing efficiency of slmed <dig> under our experimental condition was estimated to be ~80 % , as examined by qrt-pcr analysis of the transcript level of slmed <dig> in the ptrv2-slmed21-infiltrated plants compared with that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. the disease severity on leaves from ptrv2-slmed21-infiltrated plants were comparable to that from ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . the lesion sizes and the rate of fungal growth in leaves of the ptrv2-slmed21-infiiltrated plants were also similar to those in leaves of the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results indicate that silencing of slmed <dig> did not affect the resistance of tomato plants against b. cinerea, although slmed <dig> did interact with slhub <dig> fig.  <dig> slmed <dig> interacts with slhub <dig> but did not affect the resistance to b. cinerea. a slmed <dig> interacted with slhub <dig> in yeast two-hybrid assay. yeasts carrying the slmed <dig> in the prey vector and the slhub <dig> in the bait prey vector were assayed for growth on selective medium  and β-galactosidase activity after addition of x-α-gal. the positive control pgadt7-t + pgbkt7- <dig> and other indicated combinations between empty vector and slhub1/slmed <dig> were assayed in parallel. b silencing efficiency of slmed <dig> in vigs construct-infiltrated plants. the silencing efficiency was calculated by comparing the transcript levels of slmed <dig> in ptrv2-slmed21-infiltrated plants to that in ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, which were set as  <dig>  c disease symptom on detached leaves at  <dig> dpi. d disease phenotype on whole plants at  <dig> dpi, respectively. e lesion sizes on selected leaves in detached leaf inoculation assays at  <dig> dpi. lesion sizes were measured on a minimum of  <dig> leaves in each experiment. f growth of b. cinerea in inoculated plants from the whole plant inoculation experiments at  <dig> dpi. relative fungal growth was shown as folds of transcript levels of bcactin compared to slactin. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level

to explore the possible involvement of slhub <dig>  slhub <dig> and slmed <dig> in defense response against other pathogens, we further examined whether silencing of slhub <dig>  slhub <dig> or slmed <dig> affects the resistance to pst dc <dig>  in our experiments, necrotic lesions were observed in the inoculated leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, ptrv2-slmed21- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. however, the lesions on leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1-infiltrated plants were less and smaller than those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, while no significant difference was observed between the ptrv2-slhub2-, ptrv2-slmed21- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after vacuum inoculated with pst dc <dig> . at  <dig> dpi, the bacterial population in the inoculated leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1-infiltrated plants  showed about 10-fold lower to that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants  while there are no significant difference in bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves of the ptrv2-slhub2- , ptrv2-slmed21-  and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these results indicate that silencing of slhub <dig> resulted in increased resistance against pst dc <dig>  but silencing of either slhub <dig> or slmed <dig> did not affect the resistance against pst dc <dig>  implying an involvement of slhub <dig> in defense response to pst dc <dig> fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> resulted in increased resistance to p. syringae pv. tomato dc <dig>  two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slmed <dig> or ptrv2-gus conducts and disease assays were performed by vacuum infiltrating with pst dc <dig> at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. a representative symptom of disease caused by pst dc <dig> at  <dig> dpi. b bacterial growth in inoculated leaves of ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, ptrv2-slmed21- or ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. leaf samples were collected at  <dig> and 4 days after inoculation and bacterial growth was measured. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> resulted in reduced cell wall thickness through modulating the phenylpropanoid pathway
mutations in the arabidopsis athub <dig> were previously found to be involved in the regulation of cell wall thickness and callose deposition  <cit> . we thus investigated whether slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> act through a similar mechanism in tomato as athub <dig> in arabidopsis by examining the differences in the cell walls and callose deposition in leaves of slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants. transmission electron microscopy examination showed that the cell wall in leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants was significantly thinner than that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . the thickness of the cell walls in leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1- or ptrv2-slhub2- infiltrated plants were measured as  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  nm, showing  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of reduction, respectively, compared with that  in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . we compared the callose deposition in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants with that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before and after infection by b. cinerea. no significant callose deposition was observed in mock-inoculated plants and no difference in callose deposition was found among ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . infection of b. cinerea significantly induced callose deposition in cells surrounding the infection sites in the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants ; however, callose depositions in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were much evident than that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these data indicate that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> resulted in thinner cell wall but triggered more callose deposition in response to b. cinerea.fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> resulted in reduced cell wall thickness but increased callose accumulation after b. cinerea infection. two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slmed <dig> or ptrv2-gus constructs. a, b representative tem photos showing the cell wall  and the thickness of cell wall  in ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2- or ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. leaf samples were collected for tem assays at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. bars = 200 nm. the data represent mean ± se from  <dig> samples. c callose accumulation. the vigs construct-infiltrated plants were inoculated with b. cinerea and at least  <dig> leaves from  <dig> individual plants were collected at 0 h and 24 h after inoculation for detection of callose accumulation. upper row represents callose staining in mock-inoculated leaves whereas lower row represents callose staining in b. cinerea-inoculated leaves. bars = 100 μm. the callose data shown in  were quantified using an image analysis program as described in methods




it is well known that the phenylpropanoid pathway is involved in the cell wall biosynthesis  <cit> . we therefore analzyed and compared the expression changes of genes coding for phenylalanine ammonia lyase   <cit> , cinnamate 4-hydroxylase   <cit>  and cinnamoyl alcohol dehydrogenase  in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants with that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before and after infection by b. cinerea. in healthy  and in mock-inoculated plants , the expression levels of tested slpals , slc4h and three slcad  genes were comparable among the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . notably, the expression level of slpal <dig> in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants was significantly reduced by 60–84 % as compared to in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants without infection of b. cinerea . after b. cinerea infection, the expression levels of slpals, slc4h and slcads were markedly upregulated in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants as compared to those in the mock-inoculated plants; however, the b. cinerea-induced expression of slpals, slc4h and slcads were significantly decreased by 40–80 % in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these data indicate that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> attenuated the b. cinerea-induced expression of a set of genes in the phenylpropanoid pathway.fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> attenuated the expression of phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes after b. cinerea infection. two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slmed <dig> or ptrv2-gus constructs and were inoculated with spore suspension of b. cinerea at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. at least  <dig> leaves from  <dig> individual plants were collected at  <dig> and 24 h after inoculation and used for analysis of gene expression. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> increased ros generation upon b. cinerea infection
considering that reactive oxygen species  has been involved in susceptible responses of plants to infection from necrotrophic fungal pathogens such as b. cinerea  <cit> , we also examined whether silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> affects the balance of ros in tomato plants upon infection of b. cinerea. in healthy  and in mock-inoculated plants , no significant difference in accumulation of h2o <dig> and superoxide anion was detected in leaves of the ptrv-slhub1-, ptrv-slhub2- and ptrv-gus-infiltrated plants , indicating that silencing slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> did not affect the accumulation of ros in tomato. in contrast, at 24 h after inoculation with b. cinerea, accumulation of superoxide anion and h2o <dig> in leaves of the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants was markedly increased, as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants . however, the accumulation of ros in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants was much evident than that in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . we further compared the expression changes of genes involved in ros generating and scavenging system. the expression levels of a ros generation-related gene, slrboh <dig>  <cit> , and several ros scavening-related genes such as slsod <dig> , slcat <dig> , slgr <dig>  and slapx <dig>  were comparable among the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated healthy and mock-inoculated plants . two distinct expression patterns for these genes were observed in the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-, and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants after inoculation with b. cinerea . at 24 h after inoculation with b. cinerea, the expression levels of slrboh <dig>  slcat <dig> and slapx <dig> were significantly increased by 75-120 %, whereas the expression levels of slsod <dig> and slgr <dig> were markedly reduced by 1 ~ 2-fold in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants, as compared to the corresponding levels in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . these data indicate that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> could potentiate the generation and accumulation of ros through affecting the expression of genes associated with the ros generating and scavenging system upon b. cinerea infection.fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> resulted in accumulation of ros and affected the expression of ros generation- and scavenging-related genes after infection with b. cinerea. two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig> or ptrv2-gus constructs and were inoculated by spraying with spore suspension of b. cinerea or with buffer as mock-inoculation control at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. at least  <dig> leaves from  <dig> individual plants were collected at  <dig>  and 24 h after inoculation. a accumulation superoxide anion. b accumulation of h2o <dig>  representative nbt- or dab-stained leaves are shown and similar results were obtained from repeated experiments. c expression of ros generation- and scavenging-related genes before and after infection with b. cinerea. relative expression levels were shown as folds of the actin transcript values. data presented are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> attenuated the ja/et-mediated signaling and defense response but activated the sa-mediated signaling and defense response upon b. cinerea infection
to explore the signaling pathways that were associated with the function of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in the disease resistance to b. cinerea, we further analyzed and compared the expression changes of the ja/et- and sa-mediated signaling genes and their corresponding defense-related genes in the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2- and ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants before and after infection of b. cinerea. four genes, e.g. slnpr <dig>  slics <dig>  slpr1b and slpr2b, that are associated with sa biosynthesis and signaling or regulated by the sa-mediated signaling  <cit> ; four genes, e.g. slmyc <dig>  sljaz <dig>  slpii and sllapa <dig>  that are involved in or regulated by the ja-mediated signaling , and four genes, e.g. sleil <dig>  slerf <dig>  slnr and slaco <dig>  that are involved in or regulated by the et-mediated signaling  <cit> , were chosen. in the healthy  and mock-inoculated plants, the expression levels of the tested genes in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were similar to but the expression levels of slics <dig> was higher than those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . after inoculation with b. cinerea, the expression levels of slnpr <dig> and slpr2a were increased slightly but the expression level of slpr1b was dramatically increased by >100-fold and slics <dig> was significantly decreased by ~5-fold in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants, as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants . however, the expression levels of the four sa-mediated signaling genes slnpr <dig>  slics <dig>  slpr2a and slpr1b in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were significantly increased as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants . notably, the expression level of slics <dig> in the ptrv2-slhub1- and ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants was also decreased by ~3-fold after inoculation with b. cinerea compared with it in the mock-inoculated plants but still significantly higher than it in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants. by contrast, the expression of the ja-mediated signaling-related genes slmyc <dig>  sljaz <dig>  slpii and sllapa <dig> and the et-mediated signaling-related genes sleil <dig>  slerf <dig>  slnr and slaco <dig> in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated plants were drastically induced upon infection of b. cinerea, as compared with those in the mock-inoculated plants . however, the expression levels of all these genes in the ptrv2-slhub1-, ptrv2-slhub2-infiltrated plants were markedly decreased, showing  <dig>  ~ 10-fold of reduction, as compared with those in the ptrv2-gus-infiltrated control plants, at 24 h after inoculation with b. cinerea . these results indicate that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> significantly attenuates the ja/et-mediated signaling and defense response but selectively activated the sa-mediated signaling and defense response upon infection of b. cinerea.fig.  <dig> silencing of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> affected the expression of sa-, ja- and et-mediated signaling and responsive genes after botrytis infection. two-week-old seedlings were infiltrated with agrobacteria carrying ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slhub <dig>  ptrv2-slmed <dig> or ptrv2-gus construct and were inoculated with spore suspension of b. cinerea at 4 weeks after vigs infiltration. at least  <dig> leaves from  <dig> individual plants were collected at  <dig> and 24 h after inoculation and used for analysis of gene expression. a expression of sa-mediated signaling and responsive genes,  expression of ja-mediated signaling and responsive genes and  expression of et-mediated signaling and responsive genes. relative expression levels were shown as folds of the actin transcript values. data presented in  are the means ± sd from three independent experiments and different letters above the columns indicate significant differences at p <  <dig>  level



discussion
differential requirement and different functions of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in disease resistance against b. cinerea and pst dc3000
recent studies have demonstrated that the arabidopsis histone h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligases athub <dig> and athub <dig> play critical roles in regulating growth and development  as well as in modulating immune response against pathogens and pathogen-derived toxin  <cit> . in the present study, we characterized the tomato orthologues of the arabidopsis athub1/athub <dig>  slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> . both of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> exhibited histone h2b monoubiquitination e <dig> ligases activity in vitro  and their expression could be induced by pathogens such as b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> and by defense-signaling related hormones . in arabidopsis, it was recently demonstrated that the arabidopsis athub <dig> is required for disease resistance against b. cinerea and alternaria brassicicola, another necrotrophic fungal pathogen, whereas the function of athub <dig> in disease resistance remains unclear  <cit> . we found in the present study that silencing of either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> resulted in increased disease severity and in planta fungal growth . in our study, sequences of the vigs fragments for slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> were quite divergent at nucleotide level and the transcript levels of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in the slhub2- and slhub1-silenced plants were similar to the control plants , indicating that the increased disease phenotype observed in the slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants is not caused by a simultaneous co-silencing of both slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  therefore, it is likely that both slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> are required for resistance to b. cinerea in tomato. on the other hand, unlike the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> that do not have function in resistance to pst dc <dig> and the obligate fungal pathogen erysiphe cichoracearum, the causal agent of powdery  <cit> , silencing of slhub <dig> led to a reduced severity of disease caused by pst dc <dig> , indicating that at least slhub <dig> plays a role in resistance to pst dc <dig>  this is further supported by the observation that the sa-mediated signaling, which is considered to regulate disease resistance to pst dc <dig>  could be activated in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants upon infection of b. cinerea . evidence presented in this study suggests that the tomato slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> positively regulate resistance against b. cinerea while only slhub <dig> negatively regulate resistance against pst dc <dig>  in addition, the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> were found to regulate the expression of some r genes such as suppressor of npr1- <dig>  constitutive <dig>  and resistance to peronospora parasitica <dig>  indicating an impact of athub <dig> and athub <dig> on immune responses in arabidopsis  <cit> . collectively, it is likely that the plant hub1/hub <dig> and the hub1/hub2-mediated h2b monoubiquitination play differential roles in disease resistance against pathogens.

it was recently reported that the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> can form both homodimers and heterodimers in vivo  <cit>  and does not have overlapping function in regulating the expression of snc <dig>  <cit> . this nature might partially explain the differential requirements of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in disease resistance to b. cinerea and pst d <dig>  that is, formation of heterodimers or homodimers of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in response to different stimuli or signals from invading pathogens may play different roles in resistance against pathogens. another, the arabidopsis atmed <dig>  a subunit of an evolutionarily conserved mediator complex that is thought to play a key role in regulating rna polymerase ii activity  <cit> , was found to interact with athub <dig> and play critical roles in disease resistance to necrotrophic fungi and embryo development  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the tomato slmed <dig> did interact with slhub <dig> but not with slhub <dig>  and that silencing of slmed <dig> did not affect the phenotypes of diseases caused by b. cinerea and pst dc <dig> . thus, it is likely that slmed <dig> does not function in resistance against b. cinerea and pst dc <dig>  providing a distinct mechanism for action of slhub <dig> in disease resistance from that of the arabidopsis athub <dig>  <cit> . however, whether slhub <dig> interacts with other subunits of the mediator complex is worthy to be further examined because the interaction with mediator complex was proposed as an important mode required for functions of athub <dig> in disease resistance  <cit> .

slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> regulate multiple defense responses in tomato plants upon infection of b. cinerea
during infection process, necrotrophic fungi like b. cinerea often secrete a series of cell-wall degrading enzymes to destroy the cell wall barrier of plant cells and cause leakage of nutrients that can be extracted by the invading pathogen for growth and reproduction . in this regard, the integrity and strength of the cell wall in plants are thought to play an important role in resistance to b. cinerea  <cit> . it was found that inoculation of tomato leaves with b. cinerea induced a reinforcement of the cell wall at the site of fungal entry  <cit> . in the present study, we found that the cell wall thickness of the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants was markedly reduced compared with the control plants . similar observation was also obtained in the arabidopsis athub <dig> mutant plant, which showed reduced cell wall thickness  <cit> . most importantly, upon infection of b. cinerea, the pathogen-induced expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway  and cell wall formation  in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants were significantly suppressed , indicating that silencing of slhu <dig> and slhub <dig> may lead to defects in the effective responsiveness of these cell wall-related genes and thus in cell wall formation during pathogenic infection. another, it was also found that the cuticle layer in leaves of the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> mutant plants was irregularly disorganized and the expression of some genes involved in cutin and wax biosynthesis was downregulated in the athub <dig> and athub <dig> mutants  <cit> . given that the cell wall formation is closely linked to phenylpropanoid pathway  <cit> , which was responsible for lignification to strengthen the cell wall  <cit> , we thus conclude that defects in cell wall in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants may account for, at least partially, the reduced resistance to b. cinerea. in addition to cell wall biosynthesis, pal genes are also important for sa biosynthesis  <cit> . however, the majority of pathogen-induced sa production occurs via a distinct pathway, isochorismate synthase   <cit> . whether pal genes here are involved in sa biosynthesis need to be investigated further.

it is well documented that ros play important roles in the establishment of infection by some necrotrophic pathogens such as b. cinerea  <cit> . previous works showed that b. cinerea can utilize ros for establishment of infection , although it was also reported that resistance to b. cinerea in sitiens, an aba-deficient tomato mutant, involves timely production of h2o <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we observed that significant accumulation of h2o <dig> and superoxide anion in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea, although the accumulation of h2o <dig> and superoxide anion in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants without infection had no obvious difference with the control , indicating that silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> may loss the control of ros generation and scavenging upon pathogen infection. this hypothesis is supported by the expression changes of the genes involved in ros generation and scavenging in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants. for example, the expression levels of slrboh <dig>  which can reduce the accumulation of h2o <dig> when silenced  <cit> , were significantly increased while the expression levels of slsod <dig> and slgr <dig>  which are involved in ros scavenging, were decreased in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea . the upregulated expression of slcat <dig> and slapx <dig> in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea might be due to their feedback regulation by the excess accumulation of ros in the cells . it seems likely that silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> promotes the b. cinerea-induced accumulation of ros through a perturbation on the expression of genes in ros generation and scavenging and thereby attenuates disease resistance to this pathogen.

consistent with previous observation in tomato-b. cinerea interaction  <cit> , we found in this study that infection of b. cinerea induced significant accumulation of callose at the infection sites . we also found in the present study that silencing of slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> led to increased accumulation of callose at the infection sites in the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea . this is consistent with the observation that the arabidopsis athub <dig> mutant plants accumulated increased levels of callose upon infection of b. cinerea  <cit> . however, the role of callose accumulation in disease resistance seems complicated  <cit> . whereas reduced amounts of callose accumulation was found to be associated with increased susceptibility to a. brassicicola, loss of callose had no effect on resistance to b. cinerea  <cit> . it seems that slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  together with the arabidopsis athub <dig>  <cit> , may have functions in regulating accumulation of callose at the infection site; however, it is unlikely that these accumulated callose contributes to resistance against b. cinerea. this is contrast to previous observations supporting a role of callose accumulation as a part of defense response to b. cinerea in tomato  <cit> .

slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> contribute to tomato resistance against b. cinerea through balancing the sa- and ja/et-mediated pathways
sa, ja, and et all independently contribute in different ways to resistance of tomato to b. cinerea. the involvement of the arabidopsis athub <dig> and athub <dig> in disease resistance was already documented  <cit> . athub <dig> acts independently of ja but et and sa are involved in modulating the resistance of athub <dig> mutants to necrotrophic fungi  <cit> . however, the signaling pathway that athub <dig> and athub <dig> might be involved is largely unknown yet. in the present study, the expression of genes involved in the sa-, ja- and et-mediated signaling pathways exhibited different patterns in the slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants upon infection of b. cinerea , providing new insights into the possible slhub1- and slhub2-regulated signaling pathway. sa is a defense molecule that modulates plant resistance to diverse pathogens but increased sa was shown to be associated with susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens including b. cinerea  <cit> . in this study, the expression of slics <dig>  encoding an isochorismate synthase involved in the synthesis of sa  <cit> , was suppressed by b. cinerea in the control plants , indicating that the tomato plants can suppress the biosynthesis of sa and thus reduce the endogenous sa level to defend the infection of b cinerea. however, in the slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants, the expression of the sa-mediated signaling regulatory genes slics <dig> and slnpr <dig> and defense genes slpr2b and slpr1b was significantly upregulated after infection of b cinerea , implying a boosted sa-mediated signaling, which may attenuate the defense response to b. cinerea. this is partially supported by several recent observations that b. cinerea can manipulate and use the sa-mediated signaling pathway to promote disease development in tomato  <cit>  and that sa-promoted disease development occurs through npr <dig>  which can be induced by b. cinerea  <cit> . on the other hand, it is generally believed that resistance to b. cinerea requires both the ja- and et-mediated signaling pathways in arabidopsis  <cit> . in tomato, activation of the ja/et-dependent defense pathway, is also required for resistance to b. cinerea  <cit> . in the present study, the expression of the ja- and et-mediated signaling and responsive genes was markedly induced by b. cinerea in control plants , indicating that active ja- and et-mediated signaling pathways could be initiated upon infection of b. cinerea. by contrast, the expression of these ja- and et-mediated signaling and responsive genes in the slhub1- and slhub2-silenced plants was suppressed significantly after infection of b. cinerea . this implies that silencing either slhub <dig> or slhub <dig> resulted in attenuated ja- and et-mediated signaling and thereby decreased defense response, which led to the reduced resistance to b. cinerea, demonstrating the importance of both the ja- and et-mediated signaling pathways in slhub1- and slhub2-regulated resistance to b. cinerea. however, it is not clear that whether the ja- and et-mediated signaling pathways act independently or in combination in the functions of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig>  ja was found to act independently of et in inducing resistance to b. cinerea in tomato  <cit> . furthermore, like those in arabidopsis, antagonistic cross-talks among the sa-, ja-and et-mediated signaling pathways in tomato resistance to b. cinerea were also reported  <cit> . collectively, our data support that slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> exert their functions in resistance to b. cinerea through modulating the balance between the ja/et- and sa-mediated signaling pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
in sum, we present evidence supporting that both slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> contribute to resistance to b. cinerea in tomato through modulating the balance between the sa- and ja/et-mediated pathways. further studies, e.g., profiling of gene expression between the slhub1- or slhub2-silenced plants and non-silenced plants after infection of b. cinerea and analysis of histone h2b monoubiquitination at specific gene loci, will be helpful to the mechanism of slhub <dig> and slhub <dig> in tomato resistance to b. cinerea.

slmed <dig> is an orthologue of atmed <dig>   comparisons of tomato slmed <dig> protein with arabidopsis atmed <dig> protein.  neighbor-joining tree of slmed <dig> from tomato and other eukaryotic organisms. the med <dig> amino acid sequences from various organisms were used for building the phylogenetic tree. sequence alignment was carried out by the clustalx program. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining  method of the mega <dig> program with the p-distance and complete deletion option parameters. the reliability of the obtained trees was tested using a bootstrapping method with  <dig> replicates. the med <dig> sequences are from sorgum bicolor , oryza sative , arabidopsis , solanum lycopersicum , mus musculus , h. sapiens , danio rerio , s. cervisae , schizosaccharomyces pombe , physcomitrella patens  and anopheles gambiae . the atmed <dig> and slmed <dig> were marked in red.
