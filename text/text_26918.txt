BACKGROUND
environmental contamination from domestic and industrial waste discharges has become a major public health concern. wastewater treatment processing includes a final disinfection stage which eliminates pathogenic microorganisms . water disinfection can be achieved using chlorine, chlorine dioxide, hypochlorite, ozone or ultraviolet radiation. although very efficient against a large range of microorganisms, the implementation of these solutions for wastewater treatment has been limited by environmental factors, namely the formation of toxic by-products from chorine  <cit> , or by economic factors, as ultraviolet radiation and ozone treatment that are very expensive options to apply. thus, as water reuse may be a way to cope with low water availability  <cit>  in densely populated areas, more convenient and inexpensive technologies of water disinfection are needed  <cit> .

photodynamic antimicrobial therapy has recently been used to efficiently destroy microorganisms. this technique combines a photosensitizer , typically a porphyrin or a phthalocyanine derivative with light and oxygen  <cit>  leading to the formation of cytotoxic species  that destroy those microorganisms  <cit> . this technique has been shown to be effective in vitro against bacteria , yeasts, viruses and protozoa  <cit> . recent studies have shown that photoinactivation  of bacteria in drinking  <cit>  and residual waters  <cit>  is possible under solar radiation. bonnett et al.  used a porphyrin and a phthalocyanine immobilized on a polymeric membrane of chitosan in a model reactor of water disinfection  <cit> . the recovery and reuse of immobilized ps opens the possibility to apply the photodynamic process in a real waste treatment system, avoiding the ps release and the contamination of water effluents  <cit> .

in the last decade, several studies have used tetrapyrrolic derivatives as ps in order to assess the pi efficiency against gram-negative  and gram-positive  bacteria  <cit> . it has been well documented that neutral ps  efficiently destroy gram  bacteria but are not able to photoinactivate gram  bacteria  <cit> . however, many of these ps can become effective against gram  bacteria if they are co-administrated with outer membrane disrupting agents such as cacl <dig>  edta or polymixin b nonapeptide  <cit>  that are able to promote electrostatic repulsion with destabilization of the structure of the cell wall. this allows significant concentrations of the ps to penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane which can be photosensitized after light activation of the ps  <cit> .

porphyrins can be transformed into cationic entities through the insertion of positively charged substituents in the peripheral positions of the tetrapyrrole macrocycle that affect the kinetics and extent of binding with microbial cells  <cit> . the hydrophobicity degree of porphyrins can be modulated by either the number of cationic moieties  or by the introduction of hydrocarbon chains of different length on the amino nitrogens  <cit> . it has been reported that cationic porphyrin derivatives are able to induce the photoinactivation of gram  and gram  bacteria  <cit>  and some studies have compared the efficiency of synthetic meso-substituted cationic porphyrins with different charge distribution   <cit> . however, results differ. studies have demonstrated that tetracationic porphyrins are efficient ps against both gram  and gram  bacteria on visible light  <cit> ; that some di- and tricationic porphyrins were more efficient than tetracationic ones, both against a gram  strain and two gram  strains  <cit> ; and that a dicationic porphyrin as well as two tricationic porphyrins having a trifluoromethyl group were powerful photosensitizing agents against escherichia coli  <cit> .

reviewing the literature, it can be said that there are some factors which increase the amphiphilic character of the porphyrins: the asymmetric charge distribution at the peripheral position of the porphyrin, cationic charges combined into different patterns with highly lipophilic groups , the introduction of aromatic hydrocarbon side groups and the modulation of the number of positive charges on the ps  <cit> . this increase in the amphiphilic character of the ps seems to enhance its affinity for bacteria which improves its accumulation in the cells  <cit>  and is accompanied by an increase in the photocytotoxic activity  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of seven cationic porphyrins differing in meso-substituent groups, charge number and charge distribution, on the photodynamic inactivation of a gram  bacterium  and a gram  bacterium . the choice of these porphyrins was based on the following facts: positive charges are required when the aim is to photoinactivate both gram bacteria; these porphyrins are functionalized with groups that allow further immobilization on solid matrixes; previous studies performed in our laboratory showed that some of the selected porphyrins are efficient ps against other microorganisms such as sewage bacteriophage  <cit> , bacterial endospores  <cit> , sewage faecal coliforms  <cit>  and recombinant bioluminescent e. coli  <cit> . the present study complements our previous work on the search for ps to be considered as good candidates for the photoinactivation of a large spectrum of environmental microorganisms.

the tetracationic porphyrin , extensively studied in bacterial and viral pi, was tested making it possible to evaluate the efficiency of the photodynamic process.

RESULTS
we have tested the photocytotoxicity of seven meso-substituted cationic porphyrin derivatives  differing in meso-substituent groups, charge number and charge distribution against e. coli and e. faecalis. all the new porphyrins were fully characterized by spectroscopic data and showed uv-vis spectra of "etio" type, typical of this type of derivatives. the efficiency of the ps was evaluated based on the determination of the number of viable colony forming units  per millilitre.

photodynamic inactivation of bacterial cells
the results of light and dark controls  showed that the viability of e. coli and e. faecalis is neither affected by irradiation itself  nor by any of the ps tested in the dark  using the highest concentration studied . in these controls ~ <dig>  log cfu ml- <dig> is maintained during all experimental period. this indicates that the reduction obtained in cell viability after irradiation of the treated samples is due to the photosensitizing effect of the porphyrin.

the three tricationic porphyrin derivatives used were the most efficient ps against e. faecalis  and demonstrated no significant difference in the photoinactivation of this strain . however, tri-py+-me-pf showed the most rapid decrease on e. faecalis survival causing a drop of ~ <dig>  log, after a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> , for each of the three concentrations tested .

the most efficient ps against e. coli were tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me  which caused more than a  <dig> log survivors reduction with  <dig>  μm and after a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> .

as expected, tetra-py+-me was also a good ps against both bacteria, but it was not as efficient as the previous tricationic porphyrins  for e. faecalis. in this case, the tetra-py+-me caused a drop of  <dig>  log, after a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> at  <dig>  μm . at lower concentrations  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, and a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> it caused a  <dig>  log  and a  <dig>  log  reduction, respectively. against e. coli, this ps caused a  <dig>  log reduction in survivors following a long irradiation period  .

the tricationic porphyrin tri-py+-me-co2h was less effective for e. coli than the other two tricationic porphyrins  . the best result  was attained at a concentration of  <dig>  μm and with a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> . this ps was less effective than tetra-py+-me , except for the concentration of  <dig>  μm .

the photoinactivation patterns for both dicationic porphyrins were not statistically different for e. faecalis at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm . however, at  <dig>  μm there was a  <dig>  log reduction with di-py+-me-di-co2h adj compared with a  <dig>  log reduction with di-py+-me-di-co2h opp after  <dig>  j cm- <dig> of light exposure . anova demonstrates that di-py+-me-di-co2h adj was more effective than di-py+-me-di-co2h opp at  <dig>  μm of ps . these dicationic porphyrins showed significant differences on the pi patterns against e. coli both at  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm , with di-py+-me-di-co2h adj as the most efficient. at  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  j cm- <dig> of light dose produced a >  <dig>  log decrease of cell inactivation. at the concentration of  <dig>  μm the di-py+-me-di-co2h adj and the di-py+-me-di-co2h opp caused a similar survivors reduction  after a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> .

overall, the pi pattern against e. faecalis with mono-py+-me-tri-co2h at  <dig>  and  <dig>  μm was not significantly different from di-py+-me-di-co2h adj nor from di-py+-me-di-co2h opp . the comparison between mono-py+-me-tri-co2h and di-py+-me-di-co2h opp revealed that at  <dig>  μm and long irradiation periods mono-py+-me-tri-co2h showed more pi activity than di-py+-me-di-co2h opp:  <dig>  log survivors reduction versus  <dig>  log survivors reduction, respectively  . this means that monocationic porphyrin is more effective than the dicationic opp porphyrin, when the lower concentration of ps is used on this strain. against e. coli, this monocationic porphyrin was only significantly different from di-py+-me-di-co2h opp , at concentrations of  <dig>  μm . the major inactivation observed  with mono-py+-me-tri-co2h resulted at a concentration of  <dig>  μm and after a light fluence of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> 

singlet oxygen generation studies and partition coefficients
the ability of these cationic porphyrin derivatives to generate singlet oxygen, the basis of the photoinactivation process, was qualitatively evaluated by monitoring the photodecomposition of  <dig> -diphenylisobenzofuran . the results, summarized in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  show that the dpbf photodegradation was highly enhanced in the presence of the ps. the tri-, di- and monocationic porphyrin derivatives with slopes varying between  <dig> – <dig>   showed to be, under the same experimental conditions, more efficient than tetra-py+-me  considered a good singlet oxygen producer  <cit> .

since partition coefficients are difficult to measure in living systems, they are usually obtained in vitro using a hydrophobic and hydrophilic phase. the partition coefficient  is the ratio of the solubility of a solute in the organic and aqueous phases. in this case, in order to obtain reproducible results, the partition coefficients  were determined in a butan-1-ol/water system  <cit> . the results  indicate that the most hydrophilic ps is tetra-py+-me and the most hydrophobic one is the tri-py-me+-co2me. the log pb/w values of the porphyrin derivatives containing the free carboxylic groups showed that the tri-py-me+-co2h and di-py+-me-di-co2h adj are more hydrophilic  than di-py+-me-di-co2h opp and mono-py+-me-tri-co2h . these results are consistent with the expected polarity of these molecules. the more amphiphilic ps is tri-py+-me-pf with a log pb/w value of - <dig> .

discussion
according to the results obtained, all the seven meso-substituted cationic porphyrins have shown to be very good singlet oxygen generators. however, this study shows that the bacterial pi process of both gram  and gram  bacteria is dependent on the number of positive charges, charge distribution and nature of meso-substituent groups present in the macrocycle periphery.

the cationic porphyrin derivatives selected induce direct pi of gram  and also of gram  bacteria. this type of porphyrins is able to inactivate directly the gram  cells without the presence of additives. the positive charge on the ps molecule promotes a tight electrostatic interaction with negatively charged sites at the outer surface of the bacterial cells, increasing the efficiency of the pi process  <cit> . all porphyrins in this study were effective ps against gram  strain e. faecalis achieving ~ <dig> log  reduction on cell survival after light exposure at the highest concentration . the pi process against the gram  strain, e. coli, was efficient  with tri-py+-me-pf, tri-py+-me-co2me and tetra-py+-me at  <dig>  μm and after a light fluence of  <dig> – <dig>  j cm- <dig>  the reduction in cell survival for that maximum light dose and concentration  is much lower with tri-py+-me-co2h , di-py+-me-di-co2h opp , di-py+-me-di-co2h adj  and mono-py+-me-tri-co2h .

the pi patterns of both bacterial strains with all seven porphyrins were different. in general, against e. faecalis, the efficiency of ps followed the order: tri-py+-me-pf = tri-py+-me-co2me = tri-py+-me-co2h > di-py+-me-di-co2h adj > tetra-py+-me > mono-py+-me-tri-co2h > di-py+-me-di-co2h opp. against e. coli, the order is tri-py+-me-pf = tri-py+-me-co2me > tetra-py+-me > tri-py+-me-co2h > di-py+-me-di-co2h adj > di-py+-me-di-co2h opp > mono-py+-me-tri-co2h. the porphyrins with three and four positive charges were the most effective ps against both bacterial strains. some of these compounds, besides being highly effective against both bacteria strains, were also able to efficiently photoinactivate sewage faecal coliforms  <cit> , sewage bacteriophage  <cit>  and bacterial endospores  <cit> . in this study, tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me were even more efficient than tetra-py+-me. it was expected that by increasing the number of positive charges the cell killing should also increase. in fact, some studies have showed a high rate of bacterial inactivation with tri- and tetracationic porphyrins compared with di- and monocationic ones  <cit> . however, other studies have reported contradictory results: merchat et al.  concluded that the number of charges does not affect the activity of the ps against both bacterial gram types  <cit> . caminos et al.  showed that the photodynamic activity of a tricationic porphyrin combined with trifluoromethyl group was higher for an e. coli strain than the one observed with the corresponding tetracationic porphyrin  <cit> . banfi et al.  also concluded that a dicationic porphyrin was more efficient than the corresponding tetracationic derivatives against gram  staphylococcus aureus and gram  e. coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . however, our results suggest that the number of positive charges affects the pi process. two of the tricationic ps are the most efficient ones, although they have quite different partition coefficients.

comparing the photoinactivation rate of tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me with the photoinactivation rate of tetracationic tetra-py+-me, the results suggest that a high number of positive charges and a hydrophilic character can decrease the pi efficiency, as shown by other studies . on the other hand, the meso-substituent groups can play an important role on bacterial pi process. in fact, it has been shown that positive charges combined with highly lipophilic groups might increase the amphiphilic character of the ps, enhancing its affinity to bacteria  <cit> , and consequently increasing the photocytotoxic activity  <cit> . however, in the present study no direct correlation could be established between the pi pattern and the partition coefficients of the ps. probably, other interactions, not accounted by log pb/w, such as the combined effect of the cationic charge and the amphiphilic character of the macrocycle is responsible for the photodynamic efficiency  <cit> .

in our case, the results obtained with tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me against e. coli were significantly different  from those obtained with the other tricationic porphyrin tri-py+-me-co2h. tri-py+-me-pf, and tri-py+-me-co2me caused a reduction below the detectable limits  after a light dose of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> on e. coli while tri-py+-me-co2h produced only a ~ <dig> log survivors reduction after  <dig>  j cm- <dig>  a possible explanation for this behaviour can be the presence of the acid group in the tri-py+-me-co2h porphyrin. this acid group can be ionized when dissolved in pbs buffer and the global charge of the porphyrin decreases and, consequently, the efficiency of inactivation decreases. on the other hand, the tri-py+-me-co2me, that has the acid group protected, shows a significantly higher  inactivation rate for e. coli than tri-py+-me-co2h. the results achieved with tri-py+-me-pf and tri-py+-me-co2me confirm that the nature of the meso-substituent groups appears to play an important role in bacterial inactivation, as already observed in similar studies  <cit> .

the distribution of the charges on the sensitizer is another factor that influences the efficiency of the pi process. in this study, the pattern of inactivation by symmetric and asymmetric dicationic porphyrins was significantly different, although they both have a similar capacity of producing singlet oxygen. di-py+-me-di-co2h adj showed a higher efficiency on the photoinactivation of e. coli than di-py+-me-di-co2h opp at the lower  and highest  concentrations. on e. faecalis, di-py+-me-di-co2h adj it is also significantly different from di-py+-me-di-co2h opp only when the lower concentration  is used . these results are in accordance with kessel el al.  studies that reported the cell localization and photodynamic efficacy of two dicationic porphyrins on murine l  <dig> cells. the ps with the two charges in adjacent positions was five-fold more efficient than the one with the charges in opposite positions  <cit> . the two adjacent positive charges in the porphyrin macrocycle should result in a molecular distortion due to electrostatic repulsion. in contrast, the porphyrin with the two opposite positive charges is a much more symmetric molecule. the affinity of these asymmetric cationic molecules with cell structures has yet to be established, but it is thought to be a function of hydrophobicity factors, charge distribution or both  <cit> .

the mono-py+-me-tri-co2h was the most inefficient ps against e. coli, causing a  <dig>  log reduction on this strain and only after a total light dose of  <dig>  j cm- <dig> . this result is in agreement with previous studies where monocationic sensitizers were tested against gram  bacteria  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results obtained in this study show that the cationic porphyrins having three and four charges are highly efficient ps against both bacterial strains. the distinct meso-substituent groups in the porphyrin structure seem to have different effects on pi. the tri-py+-me-pf porphyrin provides the highest log reduction on cell survival using lower light doses. from this study and bearing in mind the development of efficient ps able to photoinactivate a large spectrum of environmental microorganisms, the tri-py+-me-pf is the most promising ps. in addition, the pi of gram  and also of gram  bacteria using a higher bacterial density  than the levels present in wastewater  ensures its efficiency.

since this technology is to be used in the real context of a flow system and under solar light which is much more intense than the white light used in our studies , the time needed for the photodynamic inactivation to occur would be substantially shorter. therefore, this photodynamic approach applied to wastewater treatment under natural light conditions makes this technology cheap and feasible in terms of light source. as the tri-py+-me-pf has a pentafluorophenyl group that allows its immobilization on a solid support, the photoinactivation process can occur without the release of the ps to the water output, making this approach also environmentally-friendly.
