BACKGROUND
uv damage causes lesions in the genome that interfere with cellular dna metabolism and lead to cell death. uv damage also induces a dna repair response that triggers a cascade of events, including transcriptional activation of a large number of dna damage response genes that facilitate dna repair, and trigger cell cycle arrest until dna repair is complete  <cit> . in contrast, the presence of uv lesions in dna also causes rna polymerase arrest, blocking elongation and thus, antagonizes genome-wide transcription . the arrest of rnap ii initiates a dna repair response known as transcription coupled repair . rna polymerase and associated proteins serve as the dna damage recognition factor for tcr, recruiting nucleotide excision repair proteins to preferentially repair dna damage located in the template strand of actively transcribing dna  <cit> . the arrest of multiple rna polymerase complexes at dna damage sites throughout the genome also reduces the number of functionally active and free, rna polymerase molecules available.

the rpb <dig> gene locus has served as an ideal system to investigate effects of uv damage in the cell . given the thorough investigation of transcription of this gene after uv treatment, our recent work on recovery after uv damage at rpb <dig> revealed an unexpected transcriptional response. prior to uv treatment, the rpb <dig> mrna terminated at a polya site that is  <dig> nt downstream from the stop codon. shortly after uv treatment, a distal polya site  <dig> nt downstream of the stop codon is preferentially used, resulting in a longer transcript. moreover, the abundance of this rpb <dig> long form increased markedly over the first 60 min after uv. this increase was not due to stabilization of the longer rpb <dig> transcript, as the half-lives of both the short and long form of rpb <dig> transcripts were comparable. thus, uv treatment induced transcription of the rpb <dig> gene and the mrna that was produced preferentially utilized a distal polya site  <cit> . given that uv treatment generally inhibits transcription genome-wide until the damage is repaired, this serendipitous observation was quite remarkable.

in this study we extend this work to test whether production of the rpb <dig> long form is a general hallmark of transcriptional stress. we also examine if other genes show a similar response, and if depletion or inactivation of other rna polymerases serves as an inducer of the response. we find that inactivation of rnapii or nuclear depletion of either rnapi or rnapii triggers transcriptional changes similar to the changes seen after uv treatment. thus it appears that treatments that reduce the level of free or active transcription complexes cause a type of transcriptional stress that triggers induction of specific genes and modulation of polyadenylation  site usage.

RESULTS
depletion of rna polymerase ii induces the long form of rpb <dig> mrna
uv damage has both positive and negative effects on transcription. it triggers a uv induced dna-damage response that stimulates transcription of genes required for dna repair and cellular recovery while the presence of lesions in the template dna stalls transcription throughout the genome . our previous study demonstrated several additional changes in transcription after uv treatment. specifically, the polya site preference at the rpb <dig> gene shifts from production of a 4010 nt mrna to a longer 4297 nt mrna, and transcription of the long form is induced dramatically  <cit> . one possibility is that this transcriptional change is due to a direct response to uv damage. alternatively, induction of the long form of rpb <dig> may be due to the general inhibition of transcription that results from uv treatment . as an initial test of the latter possibility, the rpb1- <dig> temperature sensitive allele of the gene encoding the largest subunit of rnapii  was used to rapidly inactivate rnapii at 37 °c  <cit> , and the abundance of rpb <dig> mrna species was analyzed by northern analysis. when transcription is inhibited by incubating the rpb1- <dig> mutant at 37 °c, changes in rpb <dig> expression are observed that are similar to those seen after uv treatment. the expression of the  <dig> nt long rpb <dig> mrna increases after pol ii inactivation, while levels of the shorter  <dig> nt rpb <dig> mrna decrease . as would be expected from a genome-wide inactivation of the transcriptional machinery, levels of other control mrnas, such as sub <dig> and yra <dig> decline. this indicates that the inactivation of rnapii results in the expected inhibition of general transcription, but with the striking exception that transcription of the long rpb <dig> mrna was not repressed at the restrictive temperature but rather appears to be induced.fig.  <dig> polymerase stress increases transcription of the long rpb <dig> mrna. a northern analysis  <cit>  of mrna levels when shifting the rpb1- <dig> mutant to the non-permissive temperature of 37 °c. northern blot analysis of mrna levels in the b rnapii anchor-away cells  and c tbp <dig> anchor-away cells  after addition of rapamycin to deplete frb tagged proteins from the nucleus. the long and short isoform of the rpb <dig> mrna are indicated



to test if simply depleting rnapii from the nucleus is sufficient to induce transcription of the long form of rpb <dig>  we employed the anchor-away technique, which is a rapamycin-inducible system that rapidly depletes nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm  <cit> . a previous study used the anchor away method to demonstrate that rnapii can be depleted from genes, and rnapii transcription is reduced within 15 min of rapamycin addition. likewise, we find that nuclear depletion of the largest subunit of rnapii, rpb <dig>  leads to a rapid reduction in cbp <dig> and yra <dig> mrnas . a similar reduction in transcription is also seen for the short rpb <dig> mrna . in contrast, the long rpb <dig> mrna is not inhibited, but instead its synthesis increases over time after depleting rnapii. thus, it appears that depletion of actively transcribing rnap ii complexes from the nucleus triggers the observed changes in polya site preference and induction of rpb <dig> transcription.

as an independent means to deplete rnapii from target genes, the anchor away strategy was used to deplete the general rnapii transcription factor, tata binding protein  <dig> . tbp <dig> depletion leads to the expected decrease in expression of several genes, including the short form of rpb <dig> . in contrast, tbp <dig> depletion led to an increase in expression of the long rpb <dig> mrna, although expression of the long form of rpb <dig> slowly declined with time. thus, like the case for depletion or inactivation of rnapii, depletion of tbp <dig> results in an induction of the long form of rpb <dig> 

induction of the long form of rpb <dig> is not due to increased rnapii occupancy
the induction of the long form of rpb <dig> mrna following inactivation or depletion of rnapii raises the possibility that the residual rnapii is preferentially retained, or accumulates, at the rpb <dig> locus. to test this possibility, chromatin immunoprecipitation  was used to measure rnapii levels at the rpb <dig> locus in rpb1-frb cells treated with either dmso or rapamycin for one hour. contrary to our expectation, rapamycin addition led to a rapid decrease in rnapii occupancy throughout the rpb <dig> coding region, similar to other genes . thus, either the residual rnapii remaining at the rpb <dig> locus is actively engaged in transcription, or other rna polymerases substitute for rnapii when it is depleted or inactivated. to determine if other polymerases induce this response and to test whether other rnaps are required for the increased expression of the large rpb <dig> transcript, we examined the effects of depleting or inactivating rnapi or rnapiii.fig.  <dig> chromatin immunoprecipitation of rna polymerase subunits at the rpb <dig> locus after rnapii depletion. a the schematic indicates locations of the primers used for chromatin immunoprecipitation at the 5′ and 3′ end of the rpb <dig> locus. ip was performed using the b anti-ctd antibody for rnapii. c anti-flag antibody for the rpa190-flag subunit of rnapi and d anti-rpc <dig>  for rnapiii. rdn <dig> and trna phe are known targets of rnapi and rnapiii respectively and thus were used as positive controls



depletion of rnapi promotes expression of the long form of rbp2
the anchor away strategy was used to test if depletion of either rnapi or rnapiii might also trigger the change in rpb <dig> transcription. surprisingly, depletion of the rpa <dig> subunit of rnapi led to an increase in the level of the long rpb <dig> mrna, while the short form of rpb <dig> was decreased only slightly . in contrast, depletion of the rpc <dig> subunit of rnapiii had no impact on either the short or long forms of rpb <dig> . thus, depletion of either rnapi or rnapii causes increased expression of the long form of rpb <dig>  whereas depletion of rnapiii has no effect.fig.  <dig> depletion of rnapi but not rnapiii induces the long rpb <dig> mrna. a nothern analysis  <cit>  of the rpb <dig> mrna isoforms after a rnapi anchor-away , b rnapiii anchor-away . c northern analysis of the rpb <dig> mrna isoforms after heat inactivation of rnapii in the rpa135Δ rpb1- <dig> . d northern analysis of the rpb <dig> mrna isoforms after rnapiii anchor-away , except that cells are uv irradiated  before adding rapamycin. e northern analysis of the rpb <dig> mrna isoforms after depletion of rnapii and rnapiii simultaneously 



since rnapi and rnapiii share multiple subunits with rnapii, we tested the formal possibility that rnapi or rnapiii might substitute for rnapii at the rpb <dig> gene after rnapii depletion. however, chip analysis of the rpa <dig> subunit of rnapi and the rpc <dig> subunit of rnapiii did not detect an increase in their levels at the rpb <dig> locus following depletion of rnapii . several functional studies were also used to probe whether rnapi or rnapiii might play a more direct role in rpb <dig> transcription under conditions where rnapii is depleted or inactivated. to test if rnapi plays a role in gene expression after transcriptional stress, we used a strain that carries a deletion of the rpa <dig> gene  that encodes an essential subunit of rnapi. this strain is viable as it also harbors a plasmid-borne copy of the 35s rrna gene expressed from a rnapii-dependent promoter. the wild type rpb <dig> gene was then replaced with the rpb1- <dig> allele, producing a strain that lacks rnapi and expresses the temperature-sensitive allele of rnapii. after shifting the rpb1- <dig> rpa135∆ double mutant to the non-permissive temperature, the long form of rpb <dig> was induced and the short form was eliminated. these results eliminate the possibility that rnapi is required for transcription of the long form of rpb <dig> mrna when rnapii is inactivated .

similarly, we tested whether rnapiii is required for eliciting the rpb <dig> transcriptional response. as an initial test, we depleted rnapiii by anchoring away the rpc <dig> subunit and then induced transcriptional stress by uv treatment. as observed previously for a wild type strain, the long form of rpb <dig> is preferentially produced after uv damage even when rnapiii is depleted . as a second strategy, rnapiii and rnapii were simultaneously depleted by the anchor away strategy. in this case, the results are similar to those seen when rnapii alone is depleted , demonstrating that rnapiii depletion does not alter the response to transcriptional stress. these data indicate that neither rnapi nor rnapiii play a direct role in the transcriptional response at rpb <dig> 

analysis of genome-wide changes in transcription after rnapii depletion
to examine genome-wide changes in transcriptional profiles following depletion of rnapii, we re-analyzed the datasets of geisberg et al.  <cit>  who used rnapii depletion to measure the half-lives of mrna isoforms with different polya tails. we obtained their dataset and analyzed which mrna species increase after depleting rnapii. after clustering and annotating synonymous reads in each dataset, we obtained the absolute reads for all mrna species at each time point in the two experiments . geisberg et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> long-lived mrnas with half lives >100 min . we used the median reads of these  <dig> mrnas to establish the baseline of fluctuations in rna sequencing reads and adjusted the absolute reads to this baseline . figure 4a shows the normalized sequencing reads of  <dig> random transcripts after rnapii depletion in experiment a. most mrnas decline after rnapii depletion. however, unlike other transcripts, the ddr <dig> mrna with a 275 bp 3′utr shows a continuous increase in abundance following rnapii depletion, indicative of continuous rna synthesis despite transcriptional inhibition. the increase in ddr <dig> expression was confirmed by rt-pcr analysis of rna isolated from cells depleted for either rnapi or rnapii . we then looked at the dynamics of the rpb <dig> mrna isoforms in the two independent experiments . a long rpb <dig> transcript with a 344 bp 3′utr increases in abundance at 40 min after rnapii depletion and then declines in both experiments. the 345th nucleotide after the rpb <dig> stop codon is an adenine which is likely to be a part of the polya tail of the rpb <dig> mrna, thus the 344 bp 3′utr mrna is essentially identical to the 345 bp 3′utr mrna identified in our previous study.fig.  <dig> analysis of direct rna sequencing  data for mrna isoforms after rnapii depletion. a normalized sequencing reads of  <dig> random transcripts in experiment a. b normalized sequencing reads of the rpb <dig> mrnas in experiment a. c normalized sequencing reads of the rpb <dig> mrnas in experiment b. normalized sequencing reads for the d

to identify additional mrnas that are induced by rnapii depletion, we searched for induced transcripts that were detected in both experiments a and b in the geisburg et al. dataset  <cit> . we found  <dig> genes  that were induced following rnapii depletion . the gene selection criteria were stringent in order to identify only those genes that are clearly induced. rpb <dig> is not represented in this list due to the transient nature of its induction and the apparently high level of expression measured at time  <dig> in experiment b . most genes have all of their mrna isoforms repressed after rnapii depletion , as represented by the nip <dig> gene . however, among the  <dig> genes induced by transcriptional stress, a subset of genes  have all isoforms induced and behave similarly to the lee <dig> gene . most other genes , exemplified by ptr <dig>  have only one isoform preferentially induced, and show results similar to those seen for rpb <dig> . similar to the case of ddr <dig>  an increase in ptr <dig> mrna levels is observed after either rnapi or rnapii depletion . additionally, in the case where two or more isoforms are alternatively expressed, the induced isoform is not always the long form. for example, the cit <dig> gene normally transcribes the long form and the shorter form is induced after rnapii depletion . to characterize whether the genes induced by rnapii depletion had any obvious functional relationship, we used panther  to classify their molecular functions. as shown in fig. 4h, most genes encode products involved in metabolic functions . in addition, we also performed a search for common sequence motifs within the 5′ or 3′ utrs, but no unique motifs were identified.

discussion
recent studies indicate that transcription of protein coding genes produces a heterogeneous set of mrnas that show alternative 3′ end formation and polyadenylation . changes in 3′ end formation can have dramatic impacts on mrna stability, transport, and resulting protein expression  <cit> . a number of regulatory mechanisms have been identified that control alternative 3′ end formation, including alterations in the levels of transcription initiation or elongation . for instance, studies in both drosophila and budding yeast have found that slowing the elongation rate of rnapii favors the selection of proximal termination sites, whereas enhanced elongation rates favor 3′ end formation at more distal positions  <cit> . such studies have led to a model whereby there is a kinetic competition between rnapii elongation and 3′ end selection. recently, we reported that transcription of the yeast rpb <dig> gene produces mrnas with alternative sites of polyadenylation and 3′ end formation. furthermore, we found that a promoter-distal polya site is preferentially used following recovery from uv damage. here, we find that depletion of the rnapii machinery is sufficient to induce the preferential use of the distal polya site at the rpb <dig> locus, and furthermore, a genome-wide analysis of transcript levels identifies a larger set of transcripts that are induced following rnapii depletion. surprisingly, we also find that depletion of rnapi also leads to changes in 3′ end formation at rpb <dig>  suggesting a more general response to transcriptional stress.

in mammalian cells, the efficiency of polya site usage and transcription termination correlates with transcriptional activity  <cit> . for instance, highly expressed genes tend to utilize more proximal polya, whereas more lowly expressed genes choose alternative, distal polya sites. the choice of mrna cleavage and polya addition sites appears to be due to an increased propensity of rnapii to pause at a proximal polya site under conditions of high transcriptional activity  <cit> . consistent with these correlative studies, we found that the depletion of rnapii alters 3′ end usage at a subset of yeast genes. using the anchor away system, rnapii was rapidly removed from the nucleus, leading to efficient depletion of rnapii from coding regions. as expected, depletion of rnapii leads to greatly decreased densities of rnapii at gene coding regions as well as the shutdown of a large percentage of the yeast transcriptome. however, we identified ~ <dig> genes whose expression continues under conditions of rnapii depletion, and many of these mrnas also show a switch in 3′ end formation. in several cases, more distal polya sites are used, though examples of a switch to a more proximal site was also identified.

the rpb <dig> gene is an example of a gene that continues to be expressed following rnapii depletion, and a long form of rpb <dig> is induced under these conditions. this long form of rpb <dig> is also induced during recovery from uv damage. importantly, our previous study demonstrated that the long form of rpb <dig> does not have an altered decay rate, indicating that continued expression is due to transcription  <cit> . remarkably, rnapii density is dramatically decreased at rpb <dig> during the anchor away protocol, eliminating a simple model in which genes such as rpb <dig> compete more effectively for a limiting pool of rnapii. these lower levels of rnapii are consistent with a model in which rnapii density impacts alternative polya site usage.

how can rpb <dig> mrna levels be maintained at normal or even higher levels if rnapii levels are decreased? we entertained the possibility that other rna polymerases might substitute for rnapii during the depletion conditions, but co-depletion of rnapi or rnapiii with rnapii did not eliminate the induction of the long form of rpb <dig>  these results indicate that the residual levels of rnapii are responsible for the continued expression of the long form of rpb <dig>  this raises the possibility that these bound rnapii molecules are engaged in a more productive mode of transcription. interestingly, many genes that encode subunits of rnapii are increased in expression after inactivation of the rna exosome  <cit> . furthermore, we previously reported that yeast genes with a lower density of rnapii are not as likely to be targeted by the rna exosome, consistent with the idea that the transcription of some genes during rnapii depletion may be more productive  <cit> . interestingly, genotoxic stress has been shown to inhibit the nonsense mediate decay pathway  <cit> . one possibility is that polymerase depletion may also lead to a similar type of stress that down regulates decay of a subset of transcripts. since the induced, long rpb <dig> isoform does not appear to have an altered half-life  <cit> , such a decay mechanism may operate co-transcriptionally.

laferte and colleagues  <cit>  reported that increased levels of rnapi activity not only induce expression of the 35s rrna but also the rnapii-dependent expression of ribosomal protein genes. they suggested the possibility of communication between rnapi and rnapii that would ensure coordinated expression levels of ribosomal components. remarkably, we find that depletion of rnapi leads to a rnapii-dependent induction of the rpb <dig> gene and a change in the selection of the 3′ end. this response occurs rapidly , so it likely occurs prior to any decreases in translational capacity. we also find that the ptr <dig> and ddr <dig> transcripts are also increased following either rnapi or rnapii depletion, though the magnitude of the transcriptional induction is much larger when rnapii is depleted. we favor a model proposed by lafrete  <cit>  and colleagues in which transcription of 35s rrna or the structure of the nucleolus is monitored in some way by the rnapii machinery leading to an altered transcriptional activity.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that depletion of rnapii and rnapi, but not rnapiii results in a transcriptional stress response that triggers the induction of specific mrnas and that many of the mrnas induced also exhibit a change in the polyadenylation site that is preferentially used. thus, transcriptional stress response must result in modification of the transcriptional machinery to cause these changes.
