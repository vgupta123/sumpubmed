BACKGROUND
biomass from perennial grasses is considered a “low-input high-diversity” feedstock
 <cit>  for the production of second generation biofuels in the us and europe
 <cit> . switchgrass , a warm-season perennial grass native to north america, is recognized as a premium candidate and has been identified by the u.s. department of energy as a model herbaceous energy crop due to its potential for high biomass production on marginal land, low agricultural inputs and positive environmental impacts
 <cit> . traditional breeding efforts have been focused on the improvement of switchgrass as a forage crop
 <cit> , while the current bioenergy research is targeting high cellulose and starch content for bioethanol production and low ash content for combustion systems
 <cit>  combined with significantly increased biomass yield. however, conventional breeding alone may not be able to meet the milestones for the commercial implementation of renewable biofuels as defined by the us government in the  <dig> energy policy act, the  <dig> energy independence and security act and the  <dig> food, conservation and energy act. thus, a biotech approach to engineering bioenergy-related traits in switchgrass has been explored by many research groups
 <cit> . moreover, the recently demonstrated potential of switchgrass as a production platform for pha bioplastics and biochemicals
 <cit>  makes this crop a promising candidate for the development of a value added biorefinery feedstock for the production of biobased coproducts and energy
 <cit> .

a major challenge for the commercialization of transgenic switchgrass and other outcrossing perennial grasses is to prevent the pollen-mediated transfer of transgenes to non-transgenic crops and wild relatives
 <cit> . although several biocontainment methods have been developed to reduce transgenic pollen dispersal, they have been tested mainly in model plants
 <cit> . among these methods, site-specific recombination is recognized as a promising strategy for transgene removal and other manipulations of the plant genome
 <cit> .

in this study, we have investigated the feasibility of engineering site-specific autoexcision of transgenes in switchgrass pollen mediated by the large serine recombinase bxb <dig>  bxb <dig> is a  <dig> amino acid enzyme that binds minimal recognition sites 48 bp attp and 38 bp attb without the need for cofactors
 <cit>  to execute unidirectional site-specific recombination
 <cit> . essentially all reactions are fixed in place, which is advantageous for the stability of genomic engineering. the bxb1/att system has previously been tested in tobacco
 <cit> , arabidopsis <cit>  and wheat
 <cit> . this is the first report demonstrating the functionality of a site-specific recombination system in switchgrass, an exclusively self-incompatible and highly heterozygous species.

RESULTS
bxb1/att recombination system is functional in switchgrass
a gain-of-function strategy was used to test the bxb1/att site-specific recombination system in switchgrass. two vectors, the recombinase vector pmbxs <dig>  and the target vector pmbxs <dig> , were created and used for co-transformation. their design allows for the formation of a functional expression cassette of the β-glucuronidase-enhanced green fluorescent protein  bifunctional reporter gene and p

 after bxb1-mediated site specific recombination removes the stuffer dna .

the vectors were co-introduced into switchgrass callus cultures using a two-strain co-transformation method. five co-transformants obtained from two independent callus lines were identified in tissue culture by pcr using primers specific for the coding regions of the transgenes. the co-transformed plants were transferred to soil and grown in a greenhouse for further analyses. transgenic plants transformed with the vector pmbxs <dig> and wild-type plants  grown under the same conditions were used as controls.southern blot analysis confirmed that the plants obtained from different callus lines were independent co-transformation events. the results also revealed the presence of different copy numbers of the pmbxs <dig> and pmbxs <dig> t-dnas .

bxb1-mediated excision of the stuffer in co-transformed plants was analyzed by pcr with the primers s1&s <dig> specific for the stuffer sequence and e1&e <dig> annealing to sequences outside the region flanked by the bxb <dig> recombination sites . this analysis revealed the lack of the stuffer in the co-transformed plants . the size of the amplified fragment suggested precise excision of the dna sequence between attb and attp and the formation of the predicted footprint attl was confirmed by sequencing of the pcr product . rt-pcr analysis demonstrated the expression of the recombinase gene and the transcriptional activation of the reporter gene . as expected, gusa and bxb <dig> transcripts were not detected in the plant transformed with the stuffer vector pmbxs <dig> alone .

characterization of the rice pollen-specific promoters ps <dig> and ps <dig> in switchgrass
in an effort to identify promoters suitable for transgene biocontainment in switchgrass, the spatiotemporal activity of two pollen-specific promoters from rice was evaluated in plants transformed with the vectors pgpro8-ps <dig> and pgpro8-ps <dig> which contain ps <dig> and ps <dig> promoter-gusplus reporter gene fusions, respectively.

to test the activity of these promoters in vegetative tissues,  <dig> plants representing  <dig> pgpro8-ps <dig> events and  <dig> plants representing  <dig> independent pgpro8-ps <dig> events were analyzed in tissue culture by histochemical staining for gus activity and by rt-pcr. no expression of the reporter gene was detected in leaves and roots . randomly selected transgenic plants from  <dig> independent transformation events for each promoter construct were grown in soil. at the reproductive stage, reporter gene expression was monitored in the perfect terminal and vestigial lower florets of spikelets before, at, and after anthesis by histochemical staining. gus activity was observed at different stages of pollen development – uninuclear microspores and bicellular pollen grains as well as in mature tricellular pollen grains in the ps <dig> transgenic lines, while strong expression of the reporter gene driven by the rice ps <dig> promoter was detected only in mature pollen .
 <cit> . the stained pollen grains were examined at magnification of 63×.

bxb1-mediated transgene autoexcision in switchgrass pollen
a gain-of-function strategy based on pollen-specific autoexcision was also used to obtain switchgrass plants with transgene-excised pollen. the test vector pmbxs <dig>  harboring the expression cassettes of the optimized recombinase gene bxbnom and the marker gene bar was created for this purpose . to facilitate the identification of autoexcision events, the two expression cassettes, flanked by the bxb <dig> recombination sites, separate the ps <dig> promoter  from the reporter gene gusaegfp, which is silent prior to the removal of the transgenes between the att sites. the events leading to the pollen-specific elimination of the recombinase and marker genes from the plant genome  are illustrated in figure 
3b.

switchgrass transformation with pmbxs <dig> yielded  <dig> bialaphos-resistant callus lines and  <dig> primary transformants regenerated from them were identified by pcr. in total,  <dig> transgenic plants from  <dig> independent transformation events were grown in a greenhouse and analyzed by molecular and histochemical techniques to identify plants with bxb1-mediated autoexcision in pollen. for this purpose, pollen grains were collected from perfect florets at anthesis and used for dna and rna isolation as well as for gus activity staining.

seven switchgrass lines with transgene excision in pollen were identified by pcr using primers e3&e <dig> . a single copy of the inserted t-dna was detected in four of these lines by southern blot hybridization . a more detailed pcr analysis was conducted with four transgenic lines using different sets of primers  for detection of autoexcision, bxbnom, bar, and the excised dna fragment. the results revealed the presence of the predicted  <dig>  kb band obtained after excision along with the recombinase and marker genes . in all lines, the excision pcr product contained the expected attl footprint as verified by sequencing . since no strong gfp fluorescence was detected in switchgrass pollen, all reporter gene analyses consisted of evaluating transgenic plants for gusa gene expression. although gus activity was detected in some mature pollen grains , the observed staining patterns were not conclusive. a possible explanation could be reduced expression of the reporter gene due to the presence of the attl sequence between the promoter and the coding region in the newly-formed expression cassette as suggested previously
 <cit> . pollen-specific autoexcision resulting in expression of the gusa gene was demonstrated by rt-pcr with total rna isolated from pollen . the observed accumulation of the bxbnom transcripts confirmed the presence of the recombinase gene detected by pcr.

t <dig> progeny analyses
since switchgrass is an exclusively cross-pollinating species, t <dig> seeds were obtained from controlled crosses between transgenic plants  and wild type plants representing different alamo genotypes. in these reciprocal crosses, the t <dig> plants were used as both male  and female  parents.

in one set of experiments, pcr was used to distinguish between transgenic and non-transgenic t <dig> plants. since the bxb1-mediated autoexcision occurs in the male gametes, transgene-excised progeny are only expected to be obtained from crosses with t <dig> plants used as the pollen donor. in the offspring from the reciprocal crosses , the transgenes are expected to be transmitted through maternal inheritance and to be present in the genome of the transgenic t <dig> plants.

in total, 556 t <dig> plants obtained from crosses of three lines with pollen-specific autoexcision were analyzed by pcr. the results from the molecular analyses of mb <dig> progeny are shown in figure 
 <dig>  fifteen transgene-excised wt × mb <dig> seedlings were identified based on the presence of the  <dig>  kb excision positive amplicon  combined with the lack of the bxbnom and bar genes . the offspring from the reciprocal crosses  were also screened to confirm the segregation ratio . the complete elimination of the att-flanked target dna from the genome of transgene-excised progeny was confirmed by dna blot hybridization. as shown in figure 
5c for randomly selected wt × mb <dig> progeny, the recombinase and marker genes were not detected in t <dig> plants identified as transgene-excised by pcr. the reporter gene located on the pmbxs <dig> t-dna but not included in the att-flanked fragment was detected in the transgenic progeny with the gusa gene probe .

for all lines, the obtained segregation ratios of transgenic-to-non-transgenic t <dig> plants were analyzed by χ2-test . complete excision of the marker and recombinase genes was detected via genomic pcr in  <dig> of the transgenic wt × mb <dig> plants resulting in an autoexcision efficiency of  <dig> % . no transgene elimination was observed in the progeny of mb <dig> possibly due to the insufficient number of t <dig> plants analyzed. the approximate 3: <dig> segregation ratio in the offspring of the multi-copy line mb <dig> when used as the male parent indicated that the transgenes were integrated in two loci as confirmed by the analysis of the progeny from the reciprocal cross. fifteen transgene-excised plants representing  <dig> % of the transgenic wt × mb <dig> t <dig> plants were identified .

discussion
plant genetic engineering provides a powerful tool for crop improvement and the development of crop-based production systems. however, the potential dispersal of the introduced transgenes via different biological vectors  is a key issue for the commercial use of transgenic crops. since most forage and turf grasses, including many promising bioenergy crops, are exclusively outcrossing and less domesticated, the risk of transgene transfer from these species to their wild relatives is very high, which raises commercial and environmental concerns
 <cit> . although different biological containment strategies have been proposed and developed, most of them only have a proof of concept in model plants. some of these strategies utilize site specific recombination systems for the removal of superfluous dna from the genome of genetically engineered plants
 <cit> .

in this study, we have demonstrated the possibility to reduce pollen-mediated transgene flow in switchgrass using developmentally programmed site-specific recombination for transgene autoexcision from the plant genome. in general, this strategy requires a combination of pollen- or microspore-specific promoters and highly active recombinases suitable for the targeted crop. due to the lack of such information for switchgrass, our research started with the identification and functional characterization of potential candidates. two recombination systems - bxb1/att and para/mrs <cit>  - and a set of four promoters active in monocot floral and reproductive organs – the barley lem <dig> promoter
 <cit>  and the rice promoters lp <dig>  ps <dig> <cit> , and ps <dig> - have been tested in stably transformed switchgrass plants in tissue culture and soil. based on this initial screening , we have chosen the well characterized large serine recombinase bxb1
 <cit>  with demonstrated activity in different plant species
 <cit> , and the rice pollen-specific promoters ps <dig> and ps <dig> 

a novel approach was used to test the bxb1/att recombination system in switchgrass. a recombinase activity detection system based on two transformation vectors was designed for this purpose. the target and recombinase vectors were co-introduced into callus cultures resulting in the production of stably co-transformed plants with precise  excision of the att-flanked dna fragment . when the recombinase gene and the target dna  are located on different vectors, they can be combined in a transgenic plant by re-transformation or genetic crosses or transient expression of the recombinase gene
 <cit> . our results demonstrate the possibility of achieving the complete removal of undesired dna from the switchgrass genome in the same time frame as required for our standard transformation protocol. moreover, no crosses between transgenic lines were necessary, which is advantageous for genetic engineering of switchgrass and other self-incompatible crops with a long reproductive cycle and overall complex genetics due to high levels of ploidy and heterozygosity. to our knowledge, this is the first report on engineering site specific recombinase-mediated excision in a monocot species by co-transformation.

after successfully validating the functionality of the bxb1/att recombination system in switchgrass, we evaluated the spatiotemporal activities of candidate promoters prior to their use for pollen-specific autoexcision. the rice ps <dig> and ps <dig> promoters did not show any background activity in somatic tissues detectable by molecular and histochemical techniques. the observed differences in the functionality profile of these promoters in switchgrass pollen  led us to choose the ps <dig> promoter for achieving high expression of the bxb <dig> recombinase during pollen development and maturation.

to evaluate whether transgene flow via pollen in switchgrass can effectively be controlled by bxb1-mediated site specific recombination, the autoexcision test vector pmbxs <dig> was created with the expression cassettes of the recombinase and marker genes positioned between the att target sequences . for more effective performance, an optimized form of the bxb <dig> coding sequence  was used that contained a c-terminal nuclear localization signal
 <cit> . the developmentally programmed pollen-specific bxbnom expression was engineered by placing the ps <dig> promoter upstream of the recombinase gene. for screening purposes, pmbxs <dig> also contains the rice pollen-specific promoter ps <dig> and the reporter gusaegfp gene outside of the att-flanked target dna fragment. activation of bxbnom expression by the ps <dig> promoter during pollen development led to bxb1-mediated autoexcision of the genetic material between the att recombination sites. as a result, a new expression cassette is formed where the ps <dig> promoter and the attl footprint are fused to gusaegfp reporter gene within the heritable pollen genome.

in total,  <dig> independent transgenic switchgrass lines were used to examine the efficiency of the autoexcision strategy. transgene-excised pollen was detected in  <dig> of these lines using pcr and gus activity staining. the results from dna blot analysis demonstrated that four of these t <dig> lines contained a single copy of pmbxs <dig> t-dna, while the other lines had 2– <dig> copies . three of the single-copy lines  and the multi-copy line mb <dig> were used for more detailed molecular and genetic analyses. pcr analysis of genomic dna isolated from mature pollen grains revealed the presence of the bxbnom and bar genes in all of the transgenic lines along with the  <dig>  kb amplicon that indicates site-specific autoexcision. the minicircle excision pcr product  was detected in three of the lines, mb <dig>  mb <dig> and mb <dig> . these circular dna molecules formed upon site-specific recombination are expected to be lost via degradation and cell division
 <cit>  but they may be stable in non-proliferating cells, such as mature pollen grains. the excised dna fragments and/or the genomic dna of pollen without autoexcision could serve as template for the amplification of the bar and bxbnom transgenes observed in our experiments. the presence of the recombinase gene in the pollen genome was also confirmed by the detection of its transcripts by rt-pcr . taken together, the results suggest that either complete autoexcision has not occurred in all of the transgenic pollen grains, or that there is retention of the excised dna. an optimized recombinase-promoter combination designed specifically for switchgrass could ensure complete removal of the transgenes in the germline or microspores , while the minicircles would be degraded in the actively proliferating cells of the developing embryo and growing seedling.

the efficiency of bxb1-mediated transgene autoexcision in switchgrass pollen or transmission of the resulting recombination event to the next generation was assessed by molecular and functional analyses. t <dig> progeny was obtained from reciprocal crosses between transgenic lines and wild-type plants from different genotypes to mimic cross pollination in natural switchgrass populations
 <cit> . to date, pollen-specific autoexcision systems have only been demonstrated in diploid self-pollinating model plants , and only the offspring of single-copy events have been analyzed in detail. since all transgenic and wild-type switchgrass plants used in our study are from the tetraploid cultivar alamo, we have also included a multi-copy line along with the single-copy ones to illustrate the complexity of progeny analyses and the potential of bxb1-mediated autoexcision in a polyploid heterozygous crop. the mb <dig> line contains at least  <dig> copies of the pmbxs <dig> t-dna and some of them are probably arranged as tandem repeats based on the dna blot hybridization analysis  and the transgene segregation observed in the t <dig> generation. the progeny segregation ratio  indicates that the t-dnas are integrated in two unlinked loci, which can potentially result in the deletion or rearrangement of genomic dna fragments between different transgenic loci upon bxb1-mediated recombination in the pollen. based on morphological observations, if genomic dna has been removed or rearranged, it has not caused detectable changes in the phenotype and development of the analyzed wt × mb <dig> progeny. on the other hand, the unaffected alleles present in the polyploid switchgrass genome might compensate for any dna loss.

overall, the results from progeny analyses revealed that the offspring of all lines segregated in the expected mendelian ratios for transgenic:non-transgenic plants suggesting that the bxb1-mediated site specific recombination did not affect pollen viability and germination. the identification of transgene-excised and non-excised transgenic t <dig> plants in the offspring of each line  is in agreement with the detected presence of both autoexcision products and transgenes in t <dig> pollen. consistent with the transmission of the recombined allele through the male gametes, transgene-excised progeny were only obtained from controlled crosses when the primary transformants were used as pollen donors. the identified transgene-excised t <dig> plants represented approximately 22-42% of the offspring depending on the transformation event and the assay used. interestingly, similar autoexcision efficiencies were observed in the progeny of single- and multi-copy lines .

pollen-specific autoexcision strategies have previously been reported in tobacco and arabidopsis <cit> . germline-, microspore- and pollen-specific promoters have been utilized for developmentally regulated expression of cre/loxp, cinh/rs <dig> or flp/frt recombination systems resulting in high frequency  of production of transgene-excised plants in the progeny  obtained through selfing or backcrossing of primary transformants. the applicability of these approaches in other plant species and crops, however, is yet to be evaluated.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study demonstrating a functional and relatively simple strategy for the reduction of pollen-mediated gene flow in transgenic switchgrass. our results indicate that the bxb1/att site specific recombination system can be used for the precise removal of the recombinase and marker genes from switchgrass pollen resulting in the generation of transgene-excised progeny. the genetic elements included in our test vector for screening purposes can be eliminated from an optimized autoexcision vector to obtain plants with transgene-free pollen. although the bxb <dig> recombinase has been shown to have activity in other plant species, no bxb1-mediated autoexcision has previously been reported. in addition, we also provide experimental evidence that our bxb1-based autoexcision vector can be used for the transcriptional activation of a gene of interest at a defined developmental stage. a similar strategy utilizing an attp and attb flanked selectable marker combined with tissue-specific bxb <dig> expression could be used to generate marker-free transgenic switchgrass that contain only the introduced genes of interest.

further studies are necessary to improve the recombination efficiency in switchgrass pollen. consistent with results from research with model plants, the results presented here clearly indicate that high levels of recombinase activity conferred by promoters with crop-specific functionality is crucial for the successful elimination of transgenes in gametes or somatic tissues. our future work on the improvement of the bxb1/att system will include codon optimization of the recombinase gene sequence for increased expression specifically in switchgrass. intron-mediated enhancement of the bxb <dig> gene expression
 <cit>  is also considered. another approach to improving the bxb <dig> activity would be mutagenesis by a combination of error prone pcr and alanine scanning which could both increase the recombination rate and/or modify the native binding preferences of the enzyme as reported previously for the related recombinase phic31
 <cit> . the outcome of these strategies would also depend on the activity and tissue specificity of the promoter controlling the recombinase gene expression. as described above, the highest autoexcision efficiencies have been achieved in dicotyledonous plants using promoters specifically active in germline or during microsporogenesis. however, monocot promoters with this type of spatiotemporal activity are not currently available, which combined with the lack of thorough analyses of major aspects of switchgrass gene flow hinder the development of both risk assessment strategies and versatile gene biocontainment systems for this valuable bioenergy crop.
