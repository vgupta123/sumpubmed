BACKGROUND
the 3rs principle of replacement, reduction and refinement has become widely accepted, and is incorporated into the legislation governing the use of animals in several eu member states and throughout the world. this study was undertaken to gain an indication as to how widely one clear refinement, administration of analgesics to prevent pain in animals undergoing surgery, had been implemented in rabbits.

when used in biomedical research, rabbits are most frequently used in toxicity studies  <cit> , for antibody production  <cit>  and as surgical models, particularly in the field of orthopaedics  <cit> . amongst the countries that annually report the number of animals used in scientific procedures, there is a general downward trend in the numbers of rabbits used  <cit> . for example, in canada,  <dig>  <dig> laboratory rabbits  were used in  <dig> compared to  <dig>  <dig>  in  <dig>  <cit> .

the overall aim of this study was to follow up on a smaller previous study  <cit>  and examine whether reported practices in analgesic administration to laboratory rabbits undergoing experimental surgery are optimal. specifically we aimed to: 1) examine whether systemic analgesic administration to rabbits is increasing, 2) evaluate changes in the administration of analgesics in various forms including local anaesthesia and anaesthetic agents with analgesic components and 3) examine trends in the reporting of other animal details such as reporting ethical approval and number/gender of rabbits used.

RESULTS
 <dig> papers,  <dig> from each time period  were selected from  <dig> journals for inclusion in this review .  <dig> papers from 1995/ <dig>   <dig> papers from 1996/ <dig> and  <dig> papers from 1997/ <dig> were included.

in both time periods, the surgical procedures most common in laboratory rabbits were orthopaedic surgeries followed by skin incisions. orthopaedic procedures were described in 50% of papers from  <dig> to  <dig> and 57% of papers from  <dig> to  <dig>  skin incisions were described in 25% of papers from both times periods.

administration of systemic analgesia to rabbits undergoing experimental surgical procedures increased significantly  from 16% to 50% between the two time periods. buprenorphine was the most commonly reported systemic analgesic administered in both 1995- <dig>  and in 2005- <dig>  . the reported dose range of buprenorphine varied from  <dig>  mg/kg to  <dig>  mg/kg . the overall use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  was similar in the two time periods .

nsaid administration for orthopaedic procedures  was reported in one paper which from 1995- <dig> where flunixin was administered . from 2005- <dig>   <dig>  of the papers describing orthopaedic procedures reported nsaid administration: carprofen , metamizol  and paracetamol .

when procedures were classified according to their potential to be painful, the number of procedures in each category did not differ significantly between 1995- <dig> and 2005- <dig>  in both time periods, rabbits that underwent the most potentially painful procedures were not more likely to receive systemic analgesia than rabbits that underwent less potentially painful procedures. for example, in 1995- <dig> 22% of papers describing the least painful procedures  compared to 13% of papers describing the most painful procedures  reported systemic analgesic administration. similarly in 2005- <dig>  44% of papers describing the least painful procedures compared to 51% describing the most painful procedures reported systemic analgesic administration.

when systemic analgesics were reported, all papers from both time periods specified the timing of administration. in 1995- <dig> 20% of systemic analgesics were administered perioperatively compared to 80% postoperatively. in 2005- <dig> 9% of systemic analgesics were administered preoperatively, 9% perioperatively, 66% postoperatively, 6% both preoperatively and postoperatively and 9% both perioperatively and postoperatively.

the proportion of rabbits that were reported to have received some form of analgesia  was similar in the two time periods . the use of 'agents with analgesic properties' are summarised in table  <dig>  anaesthetic regimens with an analgesic component were more commonly reported in papers published between  <dig> and  <dig>  compared to  <dig> and  <dig>   and were commonly combined with the use of a systemic analgesic, whereas use of local anaesthetic agents decreased significantly between time periods   .

none of the papers reported the administration of an opioid analgesic in combination with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and only one paper published between  <dig> and  <dig> reported the use of two systemic analgesic agents: buprenorphine and fentanyl. when systemic analgesic agents were used, they were always combined with an anaesthetic regimen with analgesic properties in both time periods . between  <dig> and  <dig>  local anaesthetic agents were frequently the only agents with analgesic properties used. in  <dig> to  <dig> local anaesthetics were less frequently used and when used usually combined with other agents with analgesic properties .

there was a significant increase in the number of papers reporting ethical approval between time periods . 44% of papers from  <dig> to  <dig> compared to 95% of papers from  <dig> to  <dig> specified that ethical approval was obtained. overall, papers that reported ethical approval were also more likely to report the administration of systemic analgesic agents .

the majority of the papers  reported the number of animals used. in both time periods the median number of animals used was similar ; 2005-2007: median =  <dig>  range = . male rabbits were more commonly used than females. from 1995- <dig> the gender reported was 34% , 22% , 10%  and 34% . from 2005- <dig> the gender reported was 43% , 18% , 4%  and 35% . neither the gender of rabbits nor the number of animals used differed significantly between time periods.

discussion
the reporting of administration of systemic analgesic drugs to laboratory rabbits undergoing surgical procedures is increasing. unfortunately, even in papers published between  <dig> and  <dig>  not all rabbits undergoing potentially painful surgical procedures received a systemic analgesic agent.

guidelines on refining experimental surgical procedures involving rabbits summarized from several sources are presented in table  <dig>  this survey highlights several areas in rabbit care where what is reported in peer-reviewed papers differs from recommended best practice. factors in the care of rabbits undergoing experimental surgical procedures that will be discussed include:  choice of analgesic,  dose of analgesic,  matching analgesic administration to the severity of the procedure,  timing of analgesic,  consideration of various pharmacological forms of analgesia,  multimodal analgesia and  general reporting of experiments involving rabbits.

when systemic analgesic administration was reported the choice of the agent administered was generally appropriate for rabbits . opioids were reported more frequently than nsaids, particularly for orthopaedic procedures. rabbits are frequently used as models for orthopaedic conditions  <cit>  and 55% of the peer-reviewed papers in this study were orthopaedic studies . nsaid administration was infrequently reported in the orthopaedic papers included in this survey. historically there has been a reluctance to administer non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  due to the effects of nsaids on bone healing  <cit> . although nsaids were often not used in orthopaedic studies they can have very strong analgesic properties particularly in combination with opioid agents and their effects on bone healing are likely to occur only if administered in high doses for relatively long periods  <cit> .

dose ranges are likely to be subject to revision and are typically based on clinical impression. ideally dose rates should be based on objective assessment of postoperative pain. whenever possible, a pain scoring system should be used, so that dose rates can be adjusted according to the animal's response.

sc = subcutaneous injection, iv = intravenous injection, po = by mouth.

when doses of systemic analgesics were reported, they were generally within the recommended range . one exception was several papers that reported use of buprenorphine at doses considerably higher than those currently recommended . although pain-induced ileus may often be more of a concern than opioid-induced ileus  <cit> , potential adverse effects of analgesics are more likely to occur when recommended dose ranges are exceeded  <cit> .

there was no evidence that rabbits that underwent the potentially most painful procedures were more likely to systemic analgesia than rabbits that underwent less potentially painful procedures in either time period. this is a significant welfare concern as analgesic administration should be matched to the severity of the experimental procedure. although there was no relationship between probability of receiving a systemic analgesic and the severity of the experimental procedures, there was a relationship between reporting systemic analgesic administration and in reporting ethical review permissions. papers that reported ethical approval were more likely to report systemic analgesic administration. this may represent a positive influence of local ethical review or differences in animal care regulation.

the administration of systemic analgesic agents was rarely reported to occur pre- or perioperatively and systemic analgesics were usually administered postoperatively in both time periods. when analgesics are only administered post-operatively, there is a delay until the agent reaches an effective concentration and therefore a period of time where the animal is likely to experience pain postoperatively  <cit> . administration of analgesia prior to surgery  may also reduce post-surgical hypersensitivity . although it may be inadvisable to use opioids for systemic analgesia pre- or perioperatively in combination with neuroleptanalgesic anaesthetic regimes   <cit> , nsaids or local anaesthetic agents may be used pre- or perioperatively with neuroleptanalgesic regimes. alternatively, systemic opioids may be administered pre- or perioperatively when volatile anaesthetic regimes are used  <cit> .

although the majority of papers in both time periods reported some form of analgesic provision, analgesia was frequently only in the form an anaesthetic agent with analgesic properties . this is likely to be a welfare concern as these anaesthetic agents 'may contribute to postoperative pain control but are not sufficient to exert such control in and of themselves'  <cit> . another potential concern was the decreasing use in local anaesthetic agents between the two time periods . the use of local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine by wound infiltration or regional nerve blocks, or epidural or spinal administration can provide valuable additional analgesia particularly in combination with systemic analgesic agents  <cit> .

multimodal analgesia is recommended in cases when pain is likely to be moderate to severe  <cit> , as the administration of a single systemic analgesic agent may be insufficient to control pain resulting from procedures such as laparotomies in rabbits  <cit> . unfortunately, this study does not suggest this technique is being applied to rabbits in the laboratory environment since none of the papers reported the administration of both an opioid and a nsaid.

the inclusion of animal details within the methods sections of peer-reviewed journals is important as it enables replication of studies, allows readers to judge the scientific quality of the work and because it addresses public concerns about the use of animals in research  <cit> . the majority of the papers included in this literature review reported the number of rabbits undergoing surgery. studies with rabbits involved fewer animals than studies involving rats and mice; the median number of rabbits involved in a study was  <dig> compared to  <dig> in rodents  <cit> . the significantly higher group sizes involved in surgical studies in rodents compared to rabbits may have important welfare consequences and indicate that either: 1) the number rodents involved in surgical studies could be reduced and studies would still have sufficient statistical power or 2) the scientific quality of data with rabbits could be improved with more statistical planning. since rodents and rabbits tend to be involved in different types of surgical studies , it is difficult to form definite conclusions about whether numbers of rodents or rabbits in surgical studies may be inappropriate.

peer-reviewed papers were less likely to report the gender of rabbits than the number of animals used in the study. in both time periods included in this review 34% of papers did not report the gender of rabbits used. similarly 38% of chronic experimental studies published in  <dig> in a range of laboratory species did not specify the gender of experimental animals used  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although reporting the administration of analgesic agents to rabbits undergoing potentially painful procedures increased between the two time periods examined, only half of papers published between  <dig> and  <dig> specified the use of a systemic analgesic agent. the literature review highlights some areas where practices in rabbit analgesia could be further improved including: routine administration of systemic analgesics, administration of systemic analgesic agents pre- or perioperatively, use of multi-modal analgesia and increased administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and use of other techniques such as epidural analgesia, particularly for orthopaedic procedures.
