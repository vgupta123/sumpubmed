BACKGROUND
the buff-tailed bumblebee bombus terrestris is a key pollinator for crops and wild flowering plants as well as a model system in various disciplines of biological research. this includes studies on population genetics, mating biology, sexual selection, caste determination, social behavior, host-parasite interactions, immunology and plant-pollinator interactions  <cit> . in addition, colonies of b. terrestris are commercially produced in large numbers in europe for pollination of greenhouse crops  <cit> . accordingly, many genomic resources have been developed for this species such as molecular markers  <cit> , genetic linkage maps  <cit>  and bac- and est-libraries  <cit> .

with the advance of genome sequencing techniques b. terrestris is about to evolve into an important hymenopteran genetic model species in addition to the honeybee, apis mellifera and the parasitic wasp nasonia spp. since the bumblebee is phylogenetically very similar to a. mellifera with its fully sequenced genome, a genomic comparison between the two species is particularly rewarding for understanding genome evolution in social bees. the genome of a. mellifera revealed several exceptional traits including an extremely high recombination rate, a very high at-content, the lack of retrotransposons, and a high density of simple-sequence-repeats   <cit> . the evolution of these extraordinary genome characteristics is unclear. a comparison with the bumblebee genome might therefore reveal common patterns resulting from the phylogenetically close relationship, but also differences due to different social colony structures and ecologies of honeybees and bumblebees.

high resolution genetic maps are powerful tools to study genomic organization  <cit> . moreover, such maps greatly facilitate genome assembly for full genome sequencing  <cit> . whereas most of the first genetic maps were based on markers like rapd, aflp, isozymes or mutant phenotypes, linkage maps are now increasingly constructed with polymorphic simple sequence repeats  or single nucleotide polymorphisms   <cit> . since these markers also include sequence information of potentially conserved flanking regions, they allow for anchoring genome assemblies and for comparisons among species  <cit> .

for b. terrestris two basic linkage maps are available: one map based on rapd and ssr markers  <cit>  and another map with aflp and ssr markers  <cit> . however, in both maps the coverage and marker density was insufficient to explicitly detect all known  <dig> chromosomes of this species' haploid set  <cit> . moreover, these maps could not be used for genomic comparisons between the honeybee and the bumblebee, because most markers were either rapds or aflps, which do not provide any sequence information.

in this paper we construct a dense and saturated genetic  linkage map for the bumblebee b. terrestris using recently published ssr markers  <cit>  as well as novel ssrs created from bac-end sequences. based on this second generation linkage map and sequence homologies of microsatellite-flanking regions, we compare the genetic maps of b. terrestris and a. mellifera to identify homologous chromosomes, conserved synteny blocks and rearrangements. these can be used to study chromosome and genome evolution as well as qtl synteny among species.

RESULTS
ssr markers
a screen of the bac library  <cit>  yielded 4' <dig> ssrs with motifs of 1- <dig> bp in length of which 2' <dig>  were redundant or had too short sequences that were flanking the repeat motif. for the remaining 2' <dig> loci, a total of  <dig> primer pairs were tested for amplification products.  <dig> of those  yielded pcr products and were screened for polymorphisms in b. terrestris.  <dig> primer pairs  showed two or more alleles of which  <dig> were tested for polymorphism in the mapping population "bbm1"  <cit> , a subset of  <dig> loci by using fluorescent labels,  <dig> loci by using unlabeled primers. this resulted in a total of  <dig> informative loci. the  <dig> ssr loci published in ref.  <cit>  yielded  <dig> additional polymorphic loci in the population bbm <dig> and further three novel loci were developed as described in  <cit> . a screen of 2' <dig> a. mellifera ssr markers  <cit>  yielded  <dig> loci that were polymorphic in bbm <dig>  . finally  <dig> ssrs were successfully or sufficiently genotyped.

map
to construct the new linkage map, we used the raw data  from the mapping population bbm <dig>  plus another  <dig> ssrs from ref.  <cit>  and  <dig> ssrs derived from the bac library . additionally three novel markers and  <dig> apis mellifera  <cit>  ssr markers were mapped . four aflps remained unmapped. although  <dig> markers showed segregation distortion, they were nevertheless included because their exclusion did not alter the map .

for each linkage group  the length in cm , the number of markers  mapped on this lg , the number of markers showing segregation distortion , the average distance between two markers in cm, the length in cm of the lg after correction for chromosome ends , and the corresponding lg in  <cit>  are given. at the bottom the sums and the average marker distance Â± standard deviation is given, respectively.

processing all available genotype data in joinmap <dig>  <cit>  yielded  <dig> linkage groups  all of which were well supported by lod scores of  <dig>  or higher . the  <dig> lgs, which most likely represent the  <dig> haploid chromosomes  <cit> , range in recombination size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm containing  <dig> to  <dig> markers . the shortest one, lg b <dig>  contains only five aflp and three ssr markers, the longest lg  has  <dig> markers. the length of a lg was correlated with the number of markers per linkage group . the average marker distance ranges from  <dig>  cm  to  <dig>  cm  with an average of  <dig>  cm .

this map contains a total  <dig> markers and spans a total of 1' <dig>  cm . this is an increase of  <dig>  cm  compared to  <cit>  . to correct for the missing chromosome ends, which cannot be mapped since there are no flanking markers, the length of each lg was adjusted by adding double its average marker distance to the value calculated by joinmap  <cit> . this resulted in a corrected map length of 2' <dig>  cm . hence the genome coverage of the present map is estimated to be  <dig> %.

based on the function c = 1-e-2md/l given in ref.  <cit>  where c is the proportion of the genome within d cm distance to a marker, l the estimated genome length and m the number of markers,  <dig> % of the genome is located within the average marker distance of  <dig>  cm and  <dig> % of the genome is located within  <dig>  cm distance to a marker.

genome size and recombination rate
the genome size of the bumblebee b. terrestris previously was measured by flow cytometry  <cit> . the first measurement  <cit>  was based on a staining method biased towards the at portion of the genome, hence a correction is needed. the genomic at-content of b. terrestris was estimated to be 61% by using  <dig>  mb non-redundant sequences  from the bac library, representing about  <dig> % of the genome. the honeybee at-content is  <dig> %  <cit> ,  <dig> % higher than the bumblebee. consequently the dna content  as measured by ref.  <cit>  was corrected leading to an increase of the ratio  from  <dig>  to  <dig> . thus the genome size of the bumblebee bombus terrestris was estimated to be  <dig> mb.

a second estimate was obtained using the relation between genetic distance and physical distance for two markers from the two ends of a bac clone  <cit> . the two markers ssr_0929_66j <dig> and ssr_924_66j <dig> are  <dig>  cm apart . the average insert size of clones from the bac library is  <dig>  kb, based on a selection of n =  <dig> clones which doesn't include this bac clone  <cit> . extrapolated onto the whole map, a genome size of about  <dig> mb is calculated. this nearly matches the previous estimate of  <dig> mb. the average between both estimates is  <dig> mb. however, preliminary data for the genome assembly of b. terrestris  give an additional estimate of about  <dig> mb for the size of the genome.

using the length of this linkage map , a recombination rate of  <dig>  cm/mb is calculated, based on a genome size of  <dig> mb, and  <dig>  cm/mb based on a genome size of  <dig> mb.

homology
a search for homologous sequences in the a. mellifera genome for each mapped ssr marker yielded  <dig> homologous loci, with  <dig> being homologous with unassigned  a. mellifera sequences. in  <dig> cases the b. terrestris sequence was homologous to a gene or a predicted gene in a. mellifera .

table <dig> matching linkage groups between b. terrestris and a. mellifera

the numbers of markers homologous between bombus terrestris and apis mellifera are shown for each lg. bold numbers indicate matching b. terrestris and a. mellifera lgs, as homologized lgs  or as composites if a lg consists of a high proportion of markers homologous to more than one a. mellifera lg. single markers or low numbers of markers are left normal.

a b. terrestris map containing only the loci homologous to the a. mellifera genome was constructed . by comparing both maps, it was possible to homologize  <dig> of the  <dig> b. terrestris lgs with corresponding a. mellifera lgs . omitting homologues to unassigned a. mellifera sequences,  <dig> linkage groups could be precisely matched with  <dig> to  <dig>  homologous loci. in case of lg b <dig> in b. terrestris, all homologous markers match lg  <dig> in a. mellifera. five b. terrestris lgs were composites of parts homologous to two different a. mellifera lgs each.  <dig> homologous loci were mapped on a. mellifera lgs that were different from the homologized ones. the three small lgs b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> consist of too few homologous markers to assign them to a. mellifera lgs .

overall, there are many conserved chromosomal regions in both genomes. with  <dig> syntenic marker pairs from  <dig> bumblebee lgs spanning a total of  <dig>  cm in b. terrestris and corresponding to  <dig>  cm in a. mellifera. the distances between syntenic marker pairs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm for b. terrestris and a. mellifera, respectively . in  <dig> cases three to six markers were conserved in sequential order. in total the syntenic regions account for  <dig> % of the whole map, with the distribution among the different lgs being heterogenic. lgs b <dig> and b <dig> show the largest proportion of syntenic regions with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. lgs b <dig> and b <dig> exhibit the lowest proportion with  <dig> % and  <dig> % syntenic regions, respectively . the mean is  <dig> %.

for each lg information on the number  of marker pairs  is given, which is also present as a marker pair  in a. mellifera . the genetic length in cm of the synthenic intervals/segments in b. terrestris  and the corresponding intervals/segments in a. mellifera  and the ratio between both species is given. furthermore, the proportion  of synthenic marker intervals/segments of the total length of a b. terrestris lg is calculated. likewise numbers of intervals/segments, their length  and proportion  of the total length in b. terrestris is listed for intervals/segments of markers present in b. terrestris, but rearranged  on the matching a. mellifera lg , indicating intrachromosomal rearrangements.

b. terrestris markers, which were found in a non-matching  a. mellifera lg  are summed up as "inserts".

the last column shows the proportion  of synthenic plus homologous marker intervals/segments for each b. terrestris lg.

most chromosomal regions showed rearrangements in the spatial ordering of markers, but only within the same homologous lg. these cases reflect inversions or non-reciprocal translocations  . while such regions cannot be precisely linked to physical positions on the map as there is no information about the exact locations of breakpoints, these markers are nevertheless located on the same chromosome. a total of  <dig> such blocks, which do not show an inter-chromosomal insertion, were found in b. terrestris and these account for  <dig> %  of the whole map length . the highest proportion of such homologous regions was found on the two lgs b <dig> and b <dig> with  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, whereas the two lgs b <dig> and b <dig> with  <dig> and  <dig> %, respectively, showed the lowest proportion: the mean proportion is  <dig> % .

taking into account the syntenic and homologous rearranged proportions, a total of  <dig> % of the whole map length is conserved between a. mellifera and b. terrestris. with more than 60% the lgs b <dig> , b <dig> , and b <dig>  exhibit the highest degree of conservation, whereas the lowest degree was observed in lgs b <dig> , b <dig>  and b <dig>  : the mean percentage of conservation was  <dig> %. accordingly, a high percentage of the a. mellifera lgs are homologous but rearranged if compared to those of b. terrestris .

inter-chromosomal  translocations of larger regions only occurred in five composite chromosomes . small interchromosomal translocations  were only observed in  <dig> cases. those markers were homologous to a. mellifera lgs except for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> which had been "inserted" into b. terrestris lgs except in lg b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> .

discussion
we here present a second-generation linkage map of the bumblebee b. terrestris . with  <dig> linkage groups spanning a total of 2' <dig>  cm  it matches the known number of the haploid chromosomal set   <cit> . compared to the previous core linkage map  both the number of lgs  and the total map length  are considerably smaller. the shorter map length is a result of a different mapping algorithm compared to that of ref.  <cit>  which used a maximum likelihood algorithm . the mapmaker procedure per se assumes no crossover interference causing map inflation whereas the regression algorithm  used in this study does account for interference hence producing much shorter maps although both algorithms use kosambi's mapping function  <cit> . since cross-over interference is common in the honeybee and other higher organisms  it seems prudent to consider this mechanism for establishing the bumblebee map. this highlights the importance of choosing a appropriate mapping algorithm to generate comparable and more precise genetic maps. although several markers showed segregation distortion, those markers were not excluded, since the algorithm  of joinmap is not affected by segregation distortion  <cit> . in some case, the segregation distortion  likely is caused by genotype gaps. but it can also have a biological background such as asymmetry of the meiosis  or can involve gamete destruction . however, our data don't support further assumptions, since the distorted markers are distributed across almost all chromosomes  without showing a distinct pattern .

the present 1' <dig>  cm map  contains  <dig> markers with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between markers. by reanalyzing the original data set used to create the core linkage map  <cit> , we found that the map size was increased only by  <dig> %  by including  <dig> additional markers . the genome coverage  is much higher than the previous map's 81%  <cit> .  <dig> % of the genome is located within a distance of  <dig>  cm to a marker. the current map is thus nearly saturated and thus a valuable tool for further qtl mapping studies  <cit> .

the two prior estimates for physical genome size were both based on flow cytometry and muscle cells, but differed substantially. ref.  <cit>  estimated a genome size of  <dig> mb whereas ref.  <cit>  reported an estimate of  <dig> mb. the staining method used by  <cit>  is typically biased towards the at content of the genome  <cit>  and hence may have lead to underestimating the genome size of b. terrestris because the 61% at content is only  <dig> % less than that of a. mellifera  <cit> . by correcting for the at bias the b. terrestris genome size is estimated to be  <dig> mb, very similar to the estimate of  <dig>  mb in this study derived from the relation of the measured genetic and known physical distance between two neighboring markers. theses concurring measurements lead us to the conclusion that the genome size reported by ref.  <cit>  was overestimated. there is a further estimate of about  <dig> mb based on preliminary data for the b. terrestris genome assembly , but this need to be verified.

given a physical genome size of  <dig> mb, the estimated recombination density of  <dig>  cm/mb for b. terrestris is slightly higher than the  <dig>  cm/mb previously published  <cit> . although this recombination rate is much less than that of the honeybee genome  it is still a high value compared to other eukaryotic organisms . this supports the idea that a high genomic recombination rate may be positively correlated with other genomic traits such as at content, as shown for several organism groups with the exception of mammals  <cit> . alternatively, a high recombination rate might have evolved due to sex-restricted recombination  or may be related to sociality in insects as such  <cit> . social hymenoptera show a higher recombination rate  than non-social parasitoid hymenoptera   <cit> . depending on the b. terrestris genome size in the final genome assembly, the recombination rate in the bumblebee might be significantly higher than estimated here. based on a preliminary value of  <dig> mb a very high genome wide recombination rate of  <dig>  cm/mb is calculated making the relationships discussed above even more clear. however, the sample size for data on genomes from different taxonomic groups is still low, therefore a robust conclusion is not yet possible.

using sequence similarities, it was possible to unambiguously match  <dig> linkage groups between b. terrestris and a. mellifera, of which five were composites consisting of partial homologous to two a. mellifera lgs . a high proportion  of the genome showed homology in terms of markers present on the homologous lg, and  <dig> % were identified as synteny blocks, segments with preserved marker order without disruption by rearrangements  <cit> . the genomic homology is most striking at the level of individual lgs. more than 40% of lg b <dig> and b <dig> are syntenic. if synteny and rearranged blocks are added, on average a total of  <dig> % of a lg is conserved. three lgs even show a conservation of more than 65% .

this homology and synteny can be used to refer to previously mapped quantitative trait loci  or genes in the honeybee . these loci may now serve as target candidate regions for the same traits in the bumblebee; hence, the map we present here can be a valuable tool for cross-species genetic mapping. for example the thelytoky locus of a. mellifera  <cit>  is located on chromosome nr.  <dig>  at  <dig> cm between the syntenic marker pair ssr_apis_a <dig>  and ssr_0083_47g <dig>  . in b. terrestris this pair is located on lg b <dig> . it is thus conceivable that the corresponding gene is located between the same markers in b. terrestris.

a biologically important element is the sex locus , which is located on a. mellifera chromosome nr.  <dig>  at  <dig>  cm. in the present new map there is unfortunately no syntenic marker pair surrounding this locus. the neighboring homologous markers are located on bombus lg b <dig> and b <dig>  whereas the remaining part of the chromosome is mostly homologous to lg b <dig> . while this locus has already been mapped directly in b. terrestris too  <cit> , it cannot be homologized with the honeybee, as the sex locus was linked only to rapd markers. hence, there is no unambiguous information for the location of the corresponding sex locus csd in b. terrestris. its identification may require information on the whole genome sequence of the bumblebee  <cit> .

comparisons of genome architecture can provide insights into genome and chromosome evolution  <cit> . as we have shown, there is a high degree of homology between the genomes of b. terrestris and a. mellifera. on the other hand the divergence time between the bumblebees  and the honeybees  has been roughly estimated based on fossil records and several phylogenetic or molecular systematic studies  <cit> . from this data, bombini and meliponini are considered to be sister groups, with the split of the bombini  and the apini to have occurred  <dig> -  <dig> million years ago  , coinciding with the angiosperm radiation  <cit> . the genera bombus and apis are considered to have radiated much later into today's species diversity  <cit> . despite an independent evolution of about  <dig> million years, large parts of the genome and even almost entire chromosomes are relatively conserved.

other comparative genomic studies have revealed various degrees of conservation between genomes of species with different divergence times. in the genus drosophila , for example extensive gene shuffling within the homologous chromosome arms between even moderately diverged genomes such as d. melanogaster and d. erecta  is observed. the conservation of the genetic architecture between d. melanogaster and rhagoletis pomonella   was high in chromosomes x and  <dig>  respectively, whereas d. melanogaster chromosome  <dig> is composed of regions homologous to all five r. pomonella lgs with many inter-chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . in mammalian genomes, extensive shuffling of chromosomal regions between species  of phylogenetically different lineages, which split about  <dig> mya has been reported too  <cit> . even within short evolutionary times  extensive genome reorganizations have been reported among the anthropoid primates  <cit> . these exceed the differences between bumblebees and honeybees by far, although insects usually have much shorter generation lengths. clearly many more rearrangements, both intra- and inter-chromosomal, have occurred among genomes of taxa with a similar divergence time as between b. terrestris and a. mellifera.

in light of these other studies, the large degree of homology between b. terrestris and a. mellifera is rather surprising. in fact, similar levels of homology as observed here are typical for very closely related species, such as mouse and rat  or with the example of the conserved marker order in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of apis mellifera and a. florea  <cit> , which split 20- <dig> mya  <cit> . the high level of homology is furthermore surprising in light of the high genome-wide recombination rate of both bee species, which clearly exceed the average recombination rate in insects or vertebrates  <cit> .

our findings suggest a very slow rate of genome and chromosomal evolution in these two bee species. this supports the previous conclusions that the honeybee genome evolved more slowly than that of the fruitfly or anopheles mosquitoes  <cit> . our new data and the conservation of marker order between two apis species  <cit> , suggests that the genome and chromosome evolution might be slow in the whole family apinae.

reasons for such a slow evolutionary rate at the genome level remain elusive. the relative lack of retrotransposons in a. mellifera  <cit>  or the high density of simple-sequence-repeats  might be important factors. sociality, which occurs in all four apinae tribes, or haplodiploidy could also favor a slow genome evolution or vice versa. with the advance of next generation sequencing, it will clearly be only a matter of time until the whole genome sequence of bombus terrestris and other bee species will be available. this will then allow us to conduct a comprehensive genomic comparison to unravel the ultimate evolutionary causes of the high genome conservation in social bees.

CONCLUSIONS
this report describes the construction of the first saturated linkage map for bombus terrestris with  <dig> mapped markers. the genome coverage is ~93%. based on homologies of microsatellite flanking sequences to the genome of apis mellifera it was possible to match  <dig> linkage groups. a genome comparison revealed that about 15% of the genome is organized in syntenic blocks and 21% in rearranged regions on the same homologized linkage group. inter-chromosomal rearrangements are less frequent. this high conservation of the genetic architecture is unexpected since both bee species exhibit a very high recombination rate and a long divergence time. this map will be an essential tool for qtl mapping, with the high degree of homology potentially allowing for cross species mapping in b. terrestris and a. mellifera.
