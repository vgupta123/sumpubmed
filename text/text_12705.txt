BACKGROUND
recent studies have proposed that cytokines and growth factors may influence the outcome of the damage induced by neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . transforming growth factor β <dig>  represents the prototype of a large family of growth factors that regulate cell growth, development, differentiation and cell death  <cit> .

tgf-βs have been detected at high concentrations in post-mortem brain from patients with parkinson's  <cit>  and alzheimer's  <cit> diseases. also, the presence of tgf-β <dig> promotes an accumulation of cellular mature amyliod protein precursor in a microglial cell line  <cit> . the expression of tgf-β <dig> is induced by hypoxia, ischemia and brain trauma in several brain regions, including the hippocampus  <cit> . however, whether the increased tgf-β <dig> expression observed in several neurological diseases has a beneficial or detrimental effect on neurons remains unclear.

examples for both pro-apoptotic and neuroprotective roles of tgfβ <dig> have been described. in vitro studies have shown that immature cerebellar neurons exposed to tgf-β <dig> die by apoptosis  <cit> . also, addition of tgf-β <dig> to organotypic cultures of postnatal mouse retina results in a prominent apoptosis  <cit> . in contrast, pharmacological administration of tgf-β <dig> prevents neuronal degeneration induced by excitotoxic injury in vitro  <cit>  and rescues hippocampal ca <dig> neurons from post-ischemic cell death in vivo  <cit> .

targeted deletion of tgf-β <dig> in mice results in strain-dependent defects and embryonic lethality  <cit> . although tgfβ <dig> knock-out mice in the nih genetic background live for a few weeks after birth, they present increased numbers of apoptotic neurons in several brain regions including the neocortex, caudate putamen and cerebellum  <cit> . in addition, tgf-β <dig> deficiency in adult tgfβ1-/+ mice results in increased neuronal susceptibility to excitotoxic injury in several structures including the hippocampus  <cit> . these observations have led to propose that tgf-β <dig> is a neuroprotective cytokine.

although the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective action of tgf-β <dig> have not been clarified, several reports have suggested that this cytokine may have a direct effect on apoptosis regulation. administration of tgf-β <dig> to neuronal cultures prevents β-amyloid-induced apoptosis, probably by stimulating the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl  <cit> . in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, it has been shown that tgf-β <dig> protects against the excitotoxicity induced by nmda-dependent ca2+ conductance, probably via induction of bcl- <dig> gene expression  <cit> . in fact, some apoptotic signals promote mitochondrial membrane permeability, a process controlled by bcl- <dig> <cit> , leading to cytochrome c release and pro-caspase- <dig> activation  <cit> . in agreement, it has been shown that tgf-β <dig> can prevent neuronal apoptosis induced by caspase- <dig>  <cit> .

several reports have demonstrated that adrenalectomy  induces apoptosis in the hippocampus  <cit> , probably by depletion of corticosterone levels. indeed, it has been found that adx induces a strong decrease in plasma corticosterone levels and brain changes, including apoptosis and increased expression of tgf-β <dig> in hippocampus  <cit> . it has also been shown that adx promotes apoptosis in granular cells of the dentate gyrus , which can be prevented by corticosterone or aldosterone replacement  <cit> . the adrenalectomy-induced loss of negative feedback at the hypothalamic level, also increases the expression of corticotropin releasing hormone  in several limbic brain regions which could induce neuronal death  <cit> . however, intracerebroventricular infusion of adx rats with -alpha-helical crh, a crh antagonist, does not decrease the number of degenerating granule cells in the hippocampus  <cit>  suggesting that the adx-induced reduction in circulating levels of adrenal steroids, but not the rise in hypothalamic crh release, is responsible for the apoptotic action on dg cells.

we have also reported that the adx-induced apoptosis in the dg is associated with an increase in the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene bax  <cit>  and activation of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . however, adx also stimulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl- <dig>  <cit> . bye and collaborators have shown that tgf-β <dig> levels are increased following adx, suggesting a neuroprotective effect for tgfβ <dig>  <cit> .

thus, we have investigated whether  tgf-β <dig> levels are induced by adx,  tgf-β <dig> has a neuroprotective role and  intracerebral administration of an antisense oligonucleotide directed against tgf-β <dig> in rats depleted of corticosterone levels can block the tgf-β1-induced effects

RESULTS
adrenalectomy
to evaluate the effectiveness of adx, serum corticosterone concentrations were measured by ria in all animals. corticosterone serum levels were significantly decreased after adx  compared to sham-operated controls . to decrease the chances of inducing any stress to the adx- and sham-operated animals, special care was given to preserve the environmental conditions where the experimental animals were kept . the adx animals also displayed a reduction in body weight gain respect to sham-operated animals, in agreement with a reduced corticosterone condition .

apotosis induction in the hippocampus after adrenalectomy
as shown in fig 1a, three morphological criteria were considered for assessing an apoptotic features:  pyknotic nucleus,  nuclei with extensive and tight condensation of nuclear material into darkly stained balls, and/or  segmented nuclei  <cit> . one of these profiles had to be fulfilled for counting as an apoptotic cell.

the density of cells showing apoptotic features was significantly increased in ca1–ca <dig> and in both supra- and infra-pyramidal layers of the dentate gyrus when comparing sections from 2-day adx and sham-operated control animals . apoptosis was still prominent in both blades of the dg  <dig> days after adx . no significant changes in the density of apoptotic cells were observed in ca <dig> either  <dig> or  <dig> days after adx.

adrenalectomy induces changes in tgfβ <dig> mrna level in the hippocampus
tgfβ <dig> expression as assessed by in situ hybridisation was observed in different regions of the brain including neocortex and hypothalamus. the hybridisation signal was observed in the dg and cornus ammon fields ca1–ca <dig> of the hippocampus. fig.  <dig> shows photomicrographs of the hippocampal regions after in situ hybridisation for tgf-β <dig> in brain sections from a sham-operated control animal , or a 2-day  or 5-day  adx animals. the specificity of the hybridisation signal was evaluated with an excess of unlabelled probe .

sham-operated control animals showed tgf-β <dig> mrna positive hybridisation in the neuropil of the supra- and infra-pyramidal layers of the dg . expression of tgf-β <dig> was also detected in ca <dig>  but the intensity of the hybridisation signal was weaker than in the dg. the ca <dig> and ca <dig> subfields showed the lowest intensity. two days after adx, an increase in the intensity of the tgf-β <dig> signal in the dg and ca <dig> was observed . however,  <dig> days after adx the intensity of the hybridisation signal in the hippocampus was similar to that observed in sections from sham-operated animals . also on the subgranular layer of dg there were some cells with positive tgf-β <dig> mrna signal, but the method used to measure label intensity does not allow us to evaluate changes in the number positive cells . no hybridisation signal was observed when using an excess of unlabelled probe . the results obtained by in situ hybridisation were quantified and the intensity of the hybridisation signal was normalized to that of ca <dig>  because the hybridisation signal did not show any change in that area under any of the experimental conditions tested .

two days after adx, the levels of tgf-β <dig> mrna increased in ca <dig> by approximately 30% with respect to sham-operated animals . also, a significant increase in tgf-β <dig> mrna was observed in supra- and infra-pyramidal layers of the dg . in contrast, tgf-β <dig> mrna levels in ca <dig> were not modified by adx. tgf-β <dig> mrna returned to sham-operated baseline levels  <dig> days after adx in ca <dig> and the two blades of the dg.

lateral ventricle administration  of an oligodeoxynucleotide antisense for tgf-β <dig> exacerbates hippocampal apoptosis induced by adrenalectomy
to evaluate the role of tgf-β <dig> in the hippocampus under control and adx conditions, an antisense oligonucleotide to tgf-β <dig> that has been successfully used by others  <cit>  was infused into the lateral ventricle starting  <dig> days before adx. tgf-β <dig> antisense produced an enhancement in the density of nuclei with apoptotic features in the dg  <dig> days after adx  when compared to either sham-operated i.c.v. saline-infused  or to adx i.c.v. saline-infused animals .

semiquantitative analysis demonstrated a >2-fold increase in the density of apoptotic cells in both blades of the dg, compared to that observed in sham- or adx-operated animals infused with saline . this effect was specific because the administration of scrambled oligonucleotide  did not have any effect compared to that seen in adx animals treated with saline . analysis of the results revealed that the density of apoptotic cells in the ca <dig> or ca <dig> regions was not statistically different between aso- and scro- infused adx rats . nevertheless, administration of scro but not aso to adx animals induced a statistically significant increase in the density of apoptotic cells in the ca <dig> area compared to those in saline-infused rats . we also tried to correlate changes in tgf-β <dig> mrna levels with tgf-β <dig> immunoreactivity in the hippocampus. however, the antibodies available did not produce positive immunoreaction neither in hippocampal slices nor control tissue .

lateral ventricle administration  of an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against tgf-β <dig> promotes hippocampal apoptosis in control animals
the effect of antisense oligonucleotide against tgf-β <dig> in sham-operated control animals in the ca <dig> region are illustrated in fig. 6a. compared to saline-infused controls, sections from sham-operated animals treated with aso showed an increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei in the ca <dig> region whether the sections were observed at low  or high  magnification.

semiquantitative analysis revealed a significant increase in the density of hippocampal cells undergoing apoptosis following aso administration . no statistically significant effects were observed between control and scro-infused animals in any of the hippocampal areas studied.

discussion
the present study showed that adx induced a strong decrease in plasma corticosterone levels, and increased tgfβ- <dig> expression and apoptosis in the hippocampus.

the decrease of corticosterone plasma levels by adx should be accompanied by a decrease of aldosterone levels  <cit> , and by an increase of hypothalamic secretion of crh also accompanied by a raise in crh expression in several limbic brain regions which could induce neuronal death  <cit> . the effect of adx on apoptosis is probably due to corticosterone and aldosterone depletion, because the adx-induction of apoptosis in granular cells of the dg is prevented by corticosterone or aldosterone replacement, but not by -alpha-helical crh, a crh antagonist  <cit> , indicating that the adrenal steroids exert a trophic influence on dg cells.

in agreement with a reduction in serum levels of corticosterone, apoptosis increased in the dg,  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx. also, a reduction  in the density of apoptotic cells was observed in the infrapyramidal layer of dg  <dig> days after adx, while corticosterone levels remained reduced. several changes have been reported to occur in the dg after adx. tunel positive cells in the hippocampus are more prevalent in the dg  <dig> days after adx  <cit> . moreover, induction of bax  <cit>  and activation of caspases-  <dig>  <cit>  and - <dig>  <cit>  have been reported in the dg after short-term adx. in contrast, the increase in density of apoptotic cells in the ca1–ca <dig> regions was only observed  <dig> days after adx. the difference in both the temporal pattern and the magnitude of apoptotic-cell morphology observed  <dig> and  <dig> days after adx in these hippocampal regions suggest that under these experimental conditions there are some trophic mechanisms restricting cell death to a particular time window after the insult provoked by the reduction of corticosteroids resulting from adx. this restriction in cell death is probably related to the induction of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl- <dig>  <cit> . in agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that the removal of corticosteroids  triggers a specific gene expression profile in surviving dentate granule cells including the antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> gene, providing them the chance of survival and probably making them more resistant to the apoptosis observed after adx  <cit> .

several types of brain injuries are able to induce the synthesis and/or the release of different growth factors   <cit>  providing neuroprotection  <cit> . tgf-β <dig>  which is induced in the hippocampus after adx  <cit>  , may also participate in the neuroprotective mechanisms. tgf-β <dig> is markedly increased in rat cerebral cortex and hippocampus after trauma, electrolytic lesion of the entorhinal cortex, or ischemia  <cit> . moreover, the administration of tgf-β <dig> to neuronal cultures prevents the apoptosis induced by the β-amyloid through the induction of the antiapoptotic bcl- <dig> and bcl-xl proteins  <cit> .

the majority of the studies performed to investigate the neuroprotective role of tgf-β <dig> are based on models where neuronal death is a continuum between necrosis and apoptosis  <cit> , making it difficult to establish which one of these processes prevails. these processes are associated with different mechanisms buffering cell death. to differentiate which one of these processes is relevant, we used a model in which apoptosis takes place in a rather selective manner  <cit> . adx has been proposed as a good in vivo model for hippocampal apoptosis, because it is a non invasive procedure to the brain and, as it is also shown in this study, it triggers apoptosis by corticosteroid and aldosterone reduction only  <cit> . thus, we have evaluated with the adx model if the expression of tgf-β <dig> is modified.

primary rat hippocampal neuronal culture secretes tgf-β <dig> making feasible an autocrine and/or paracrine role in the hippocampus  <cit> . tgf-β <dig> mrna and its protein have been localised in both hippocampal neurons and glia  <cit> . hippocampal ca1–ca <dig> neurons display immunoreactivity for active tgf-β <dig> under physiological conditions, although mrna expression was low  <cit> . these evidences suggest basal expression of tgf-β <dig> in the hippocampus. in the present study, expression of tgf-β <dig> mrna was observed in the neuropil of the supra and infra-pyramidal layers of dg and comparatively weaker in the ca <dig> and ca <dig> subfields. taken together, these results indicate the existence of basal expression of tgf-β <dig> in the hippocampus.

labelling for tgf-β <dig> mrna over ox-42-positive microglia with an activated morphology in the dentate gyrus granule cell layer has been observed  <dig> days after adx  <cit> . in our studies, the expression of tgf-β <dig> mrna showed a transient increase in both ca <dig> and supra- and infrapyramidal-layers of the dg  <dig> days after adx with values returning to control levels  <dig> days after adx. the plastic changes observed in the present study could be related to the permanent reduction of corticosteroid plasma levels and/or to cell death promoted by adx.

it is well established that corticosteroids regulate many physiological processes through their binding to glucocorticoid receptors . the ligand-activated receptor dimer activates gene expression by binding to specific dna sequences  in the promoter regions of glucocorticoid-regulated genes  <cit> . in contrast to the regulation of these classical gres, the repression of negatively regulated target genes is mediated by trans-repression and/or by the binding of the gr to negative gres   <cit> . it is possible that ngres are also present in the tgf-β <dig> gene promoter region. the corticosterone reduction switches off the action of the ngres, enhancing the expression of tgf-β <dig>  at least in humans, it is known that human tgf-β <dig> gene has a gre in its promoter  <cit> , probably acting as a repressor of the tgf-β <dig> gene expression. indeed, the increase in the expression of hippocampal tgf-β <dig> by adx is prevented by corticosterone administration  <cit> . however, this mechanism cannot totally account for the normalization of tgf-β <dig> mrna levels observed  <dig> days after adx in our experiments.

during the early stages of apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is exposed to the cell surface, triggering cell engulfment by neighboring cells or phagocytes. however, exposure of phosphatidyl-serine to the outer face of plasma membrane in the apoptotic cells acts as a stimulus to induce the expression of tgf-β <dig> by microglia  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of tgf-β <dig> observed following adx may result from neuronal death itself, similar to that reported by other scientists  <cit> . however, other authors have observed an increase in tgf-β <dig> expression  <dig> days after adx although in different rat strains  <cit> . recently, the same authors showed the time course of tgf-β <dig> mrna expression in the dg which is increased  <dig> days after adx  reaching maximum  <dig> days after adx  <cit> . also the levels of expression are mantained  <dig> days after adx, a period where the apoptosis is still occurring. however these authors did not study the tgf-β <dig> expression after  <dig> or more days after adx. more recently, battista et al  <cit>  showed an increase in tgf-β <dig> by rt-pcr in the hippocampus  <dig> days after adx. it is possible that the adx-induced expression of tgf-β <dig> could be biphasic, i.e. an early generalized induction of tgf-β <dig> mrna in the hippocampus  which is maintained for a few days after adx  and thereafter the gene is re-expressed between 5– <dig> days of adx and persists over adx period in areas undergoing neuronal death, i.e. in the dg. a similar pattern of tgf-β <dig> induction has been reported in the post-ischemic adult rat hippocampus  <cit> .

thus, it was interesting to study the effect of blocking tgf-β <dig> mrna translation by an antisense oligonucleotide. we used this approach instead of blocking the tgf-β <dig> peptide using neutralizing antibodies, because the oligonucleotide is more diffusible that an antibody. also the administration of a neutralizing antibody requires a single application near to the site of interest, i.e. close to the dg or ca areas, making it feasible to induce tissue damage and by this means microglia activation. we used a tgf-β <dig> aso developed by le roy et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that antisense prevented the translation of tgf-β <dig> mrna by leydig cells and, consequently, reduced tgf-β <dig> immunoreactivity, which was not observed following administration of a corresponding scro

in this study, sustained i.c.v. administration of that tgf-β <dig> aso via an osmotic mini pump increased apoptosis levels in ca and dg regions  <dig> days after adx, but also in sham-operated control animals. indeed, when tgf-β <dig> aso was administered to sham-operated animals, apoptotic cells were increased in both ca <dig> and dg regions, while in adx-animals the effect was restricted to the dg. the ca <dig> area shows low levels of tgf-β <dig> mrna, both in control and adx animals, indicating that its expression is independent of corticosterone levels. the finding that aso administration promotes apoptosis in ca <dig> led us to propose that low levels of tgf-β <dig> are enough to protect cells against apoptosis in this hippocampal subfield. also tgf-β <dig> is capable of suppressing the levels of tnf-α  <cit> , suggesting that the reduction of tgf-β <dig> by aso treatment might induce the expression of this pro-inflammatory cytokine, that can also promote apoptosis through its receptor <cit> . it is remarkable that ca <dig> field is normally resistant to ischemia  <cit>  and adx  and this phenomena could be achieved through a tonic expression of tgf-β <dig>  <cit> . interestingly tgf-β <dig> deficiency in adult tgfβ1-/+ mice results in increased neuronal susceptibility to excitotoxic injury in several structures including the hippocampus  <cit> .

the lack of effect of the tgf-β <dig> aso on adx ca <dig> may be explained by other neurotrophic factors elicited by the lesion. in fact, it has been shown that adx promotes the induction of bdnf in pyramidal regions of the hippocampus  <cit> .

in the present study, scro administration did not induce any effect on apoptosis levels, except in ca <dig> of adx animals, where there was an increase of apoptosis levels following intracerebral scro administration. while we do not have any explanation for this effect, it may be speculated that is probably due to the presence of an unmethylated cpg dinucleotide in the scro sequence. this a motif that has been reported to stimulate microglia and astrocytes in the cns, releasing tnf-α, a pro-inflamatory cytokine <cit> . this cytokine may exert in turn neuronal injury in vulnerable regions  <cit> , under conditions where there is a decrease of corticosterone levels, like following adx.

CONCLUSIONS
adx promotes a permanent decrease of plasma corticoid levels and transient increase of apoptosis and tgf-β <dig> expression in hippocampus, reaching a maximum  <dig> days after adx. the effect was mainly observed in supra- and infra-layers of the dg, where the expression of tgf-β <dig> mrna was stronger than in any other regions of the hippocampus.

administration of a tgf-β <dig> aso promoted hippocampal apoptosis, both in sham- and adx-animals. in sham-operated animals, apoptosis was increased in both ca <dig> and dg regions, while in adx-animals the effect was restricted to the dg. the lack of effect of the tgf-β <dig> aso on adx ca <dig> can be explained by other neurotrophic factors elicited by the lesion.

these observations, together with previously published reports indicating an increase in the expression of tgf-β <dig> in response to brain injuries, suggest that tgf-β <dig> exerts neuroprotection in adult nervous system.
