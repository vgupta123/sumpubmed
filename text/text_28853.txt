BACKGROUND
melioidosis is a serious and often fatal infectious disease common to southeast asia and northern australia caused by the gram-negative soil bacterium burkholderia pseudomallei. b. pseudomallei is a highly versatile pathogen capable of surviving inside mammalian cells and in many environmental niches. the bacterium can infect numerous animal species, amoebae, nematodes, and tomato plants  <cit> – <cit> , and has been previously found within the tissues of exotic grasses in australia  <cit> . the environmental origin of b. pseudomallei and its promiscuous host range have shaped the hypothesis that some of its genetic loci evolved in the rhizosphere as anti-predation determinants that subsequently promote “accidental” virulence in humans and animals. in recent years, important advances have been made in understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of b. pseudomallei including the roles of the type iii and type vi secretion systems   <cit> – <cit> . b. pseudomallei contains three t3sss and six t6sss, but only t3ss <dig>  and t6ss <dig> are critical for pathogenesis in mice and hamsters  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> .

expression of the t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> gene clusters is tightly controlled, both temporally and spatially, during the b. pseudomallei intracellular lifecycle. we have identified a regulatory cascade that coordinately activates t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> gene expression in growth medium and in infected mammalian cells  <cit> , <cit> . at the top of the cascade is the tetr-type regulator bspr that stimulates the expression of bprp. the bspr gene is located on chromosome  <dig> of the b. pseudomallei genome whereas bprp is part of the t3ss <dig> gene cluster on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the toxr-like bprp in turn activates genes encoding the structural components of t3ss <dig>  including the arac-type regulatory gene bsan. bsan is important for the activation of t3ss <dig> effector and translocon gene expression, and several regulatory genes including bprc and virag, whose gene products control t6ss <dig> expression  <cit> . the mechanisms through which these transcriptional regulators control the expression of their target genes are not understood. it is also unclear whether these regulators are acting directly on the identified target genes or through as yet undiscovered intermediary regulators, and whether additional host cell cofactors are involved that may serve as intracellular signals.

compared to t3sss in other pathogens such as pseudomonas, salmonella and shigella, only a limited number of effectors have been identified for b. pseudomallei t3ss <dig>  one of the effector proteins secreted by t3ss <dig> is bope, which is annotated to exhibit guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity and has been reported to facilitate invasion of epithelial cells  <cit> . bopa is generally assumed to encode a t3ss <dig> effector since it is located adjacent to bope, although t3ss3-dependent secretion of bopa has never been verified. functionally, bopa has been described to promote resistance to lc3-associated autophagy and a bopa mutation results in an intracellular replication defect  <cit> , <cit> . a third effector protein, bopc , was recently shown to be secreted via t3ss <dig>  and bopc mutants were reported to be less invasive in epithelial cells  <cit>  and to exhibit delayed endosome escape and reduced intracellular growth in j <dig> murine macrophages  <cit> .

to determine the full extent of the bsan regulon and examine whether bsan activates the expression of additional effector genes, we performed global transcriptome analysis of b. pseudomallei khw wildtype  and a Δbsan mutant strain using rnaseq. our analysis shows that  <dig> genes are under the direct or indirect transcriptional control of bsan. in addition to activating loci associated with t3ss <dig>  we demonstrate that bsan functions to repress transcription of other loci. thus, bsan functions as a central regulatory factor within a more extensive network to facilitate the intracellular lifecycle of b. pseudomallei.

RESULTS
identification of the bsan regulon through rnaseq analysis
bsan  was previously shown to function as a central regulator of a hierarchical cascade that activates effector and translocon genes of t3ss <dig> as well as several associated regulatory genes  <cit> , <cit> . furthermore, bsan was shown to activate the expression of certain t6ss1-associated genes including the two-component regulatory system locus virag , and the bim actin motility genes . to gain further insight into the bsan regulon, massive parallel sequencing was performed on cdna prepared from rna isolated from wild-type and Δbsan mutant strains. we had previously shown that complementation of our Δbsan mutant with a bsan plasmid could restore the secretion of the bope effector  <cit> , showing that our complementation restored protein expression of the effectors and that the mutation was specific to bsan and not due to off target effects.

between  <dig> and  <dig> million reads  were obtained that aligned to non-ribosomal genes in the khw  <cit>  genome . reads of the technical replicates displayed high reproducibility   demonstrating that variability was not introduced through sample preparation or sequencing errors. the k <dig> reference genome was co-aligned for ease of gene annotation. the nucleotide sequences of chromosomes i and ii are  <dig>  and  <dig> % identical, respectively.

comparison between wild-type and Δbsan transcriptomes identified  <dig> genes that were differentially regulated using 3-fold or more  as the cut off. of these,  <dig> genes were expressed more highly in wild-type khw compared to the Δbsan strain, indicating that bsan directly or indirectly activates their transcription . however,  <dig> genes were expressed more highly in the Δbsan mutant suggesting that bsan can function directly or indirectly as a repressor . rnaseq results were validated using quantitative real time-pcr  analysis for select loci. rnaseq analysis identified all genes that we had previously shown to be activated by bsan  <cit> , <cit>  . the effector and chaperone genes bope, bopa and bicp together with the regulatory gene bprd were amongst the highest activated genes . in addition, two putative transposase genes separating the t3ss <dig> genes and the t6ss <dig> gene clusters were highly activated by bsan . genes activated at lower levels  include a hybrid non-ribosomal peptide synthase /polyketide synthase  locus consisting of  <dig> genes  unique to b. pseudomallei and b. mallei. nrps/pks systems are found in microbes and fungi, and are generally responsible for the production of complex natural compounds such as antibiotics and siderophores. burkholderia species are rich in nrps/pks loci that contain multiple metabolic genes or encode large multidomain synthases  <cit> . although the precise function of this nrps/pks locus is not currently known, the presence of a diaminobutyrate-2-oxoglutarate amino transferase gene  suggests that  <dig> -diaminobutrate is one of the polyketide’s component. loci for methionine and threonine biosynthesis, as well as ribose uptake , were activated at similar levels. representative bsan-activated genes were confirmed by qrt-pcr .

intriguingly, genes encoding the t3ss <dig> apparatus components were found to be repressed in the wildtype compared with the Δbsan mutant, suggesting a role for bsan in limiting apparatus synthesis when translocon and effector genes are transcribed . also repressed are polar flagellar motility loci on chromosome  <dig> including the flagellin genes flic and flid, as well as flagellar hook proteins flgl and flgk. repression of these genes as well as mota  and ched  were validated by qrt-pcr . in salmonella and other bacteria, motab are key components of the flagellar motor complex  <cit> . motab in khw are part of a chemotaxis  locus, which is repressed 2– <dig> -fold  as assessed by rnaseq. in addition, expression of a second polyketide biosynthesis locus  was reduced in a Δbsan mutant, possibly by repression of a co-localized arac-type regulatory gene, bpss <dig> . however, down-regulation of this cluster could not be verified by qrt-pcr . we were likewise unable to validate repression of bpsl2404- <dig>  which putatively encode transport and energy metabolism functions, respectively, in addition to bpss1887- <dig>  which are postulated to encode oxidative enzymes for energy metabolism.

additional loci implicated in lipid and energy metabolism are also repressed . catabolic genes encode a cytochrome o oxidase typically used by bacteria in an oxygen-rich environment  <cit> , along with enzymes involved in the aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds and in the degradation of arginine. a gene involved in the synthesis of betaine, an osmoprotectant which serves to adapt gram-negative bacteria to conditions of high osmolarity, is also repressed by bsan.

bsan together with chaperone bica directly activate t3ss <dig> effector and t6ss <dig> regulatory genes
we have previously shown that expression of the two component regulatory system virag and the genes from bpss <dig>  to bpss <dig>  in the t3ss <dig> cluster were regulated by bsan in concert with the chaperone bica  <cit> . to determine whether bsan/bica activate these genes directly, bsan and bica open reading frames  from b. pseudomallei strain khw were inserted into a plasmid downstream of an arabinose-inducible promoter on pmlbad  <cit> . these constructs were introduced into e. coli dh5α  <cit>  along with an additional construct containing putative promoter regions of several bsan target genes transcriptionally fused to lacz on prw <dig>  <cit>  or prw50mob, which contains the orit fragment for pot <dig>  <cit> . the effect of bsan/bica on promoter activity was then assessed by β-galactosidase activities.

the putative bsan orf is annotated in the b. pseudomallei genome database to initiate from a gtg start codon  <cit> . we identified a second potential start codon  and ribosome binding site  <dig> nucleotides  upstream of gtg . bsan/bica expression constructs  that were initiated from gtg were unable to activate transcription of bica, bopa and bope in e. coli , supporting the notion that the atg was the actual start codon for bsan. furthermore, a transcriptional start site was identified  <dig> nucleotide upstream of the atg codon via rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends  . a putative ribosomal binding site  is located in front of the atg condon. replacing the gtg-initiated bsan orf with the longer version containing the atg start site resulted in activation of the bica, bopa and bope promoters as well as those for bpss <dig> , bpss  <dig>  and the putative transposase bpss <dig> . expression of bsan alone was not sufficient to activate these promoters , demonstrating the co-requirement for bica. no apparent bsan/bica-dependent promoter activity was obtained for bpss <dig> , bpss <dig> , bpss <dig> , or bpss <dig>   . furthermore, bsan/bica could not activate transcription of a bpss <dig> -lacz fusion in e. coli . thus, bsan/bica drives the expression of bprdc and the bpss1518- <dig> operons directly, whereas bicp and bprb gene expression is likely driven by the upstream-located bopa promoter. transcription of the bapabc and bpra genes could be driven from the bica promoter. collectively, these results are represented in figure 2c where the five validated promoters and operon structures controlled directly by bsan/bica are depicted by black solid line arrows.

identification of transcriptional start sites and the sequence motif for bsan/bica activation
similarities between bsan/bica regulated promoters were examined by first determining their transcriptional start sites using rlm-race. one transcriptional start site was identified for the bica, bprd and bpss <dig> promoters, and two start sites were detected for the bopa and vira promoters. we were unable to identify a transcriptional start site for bope, which is divergently transcribed from bopa . a 150-bp sequence upstream of each transcriptional start site was submitted to meme , which identified a 15 bp motif that we designated as the putative bsan box . the distance from the transcriptional start site varied from 24 bp  to 35 bp  . when the motif was submitted to motif alignment & search tool  to search for other potential bsan/bica-regulated promoters in the b. pseudomallei genome , bsan boxes were also found upstream of tssm and bpss <dig>  a putative gene encoding an arac family protein, in addition to those already identified. however, qrt- pcr analysis of bpss <dig> expression in Δbsan and Δbica mutants did not reveal a decrease in expression compared to wild-type bacteria . bpss <dig> is located adjacent but transcribed in the opposite direction to the operon bpss1884- <dig>  which was shown by rnaseq to be repressed by bsan . although we could not confirm bsan-dependent regulation of bpss <dig> by qrt-pcr, the upstream bsan box suggests the possible involvement of this putative regulator in repression of the operon in vivo. it is likely that conditions for bsan-dependent repression are difficult to establish in vitro resulting in variability and lack of validation. we also could not identify any − <dig> and − <dig> sequences for prokaryotic housekeeping sigma factor in these promoters. it is likely that the bsan/bica-regulated promoters are transcribed by one or more alternative sigma factors. unfortunately, b. pseudomallei genome harbours more than  <dig> alternative sigma factors that have not been systematically studied. therefore, their recognition sequences are currently unknown.

tssm is one of the highly activated genes in our rnaseq analysis  confirming previous in vivo expression studies  <cit> . however, despite the presence of the bsan box upstream of the putative tssm operon , bsan/bica alone is not sufficient to activate tssm transcription in e. coli . this suggests that tssm regulation is more complex and likely requires additional cis and/or trans-acting regulatory elements for activation.

determining the sequence motif requirement for bsan/bica activation
to determine whether the putative bsan box motif was required and sufficient for the other genes regulated by bsan/bica, we constructed two types of truncated promoter-lacz fusions. the “type 1” deletion contained only the bsan motif and lacked all upstream sequences. the “type 2” deletion lacked all upstream sequences in addition to the first six bp of the putative bsan box motif. we assayed the ability of these truncated promoters to drive lacz expression in the presence of bsan/bica. all truncated versions of the promoter regions for bica, vira and bpss <dig> lost promoter activity . in contrast, versions containing the intact bsan box for bprd  and bopa  were still functional, but further truncation eliminated their activation. the type  <dig> truncated version of the bprd promoter  had three-fold higher β-galactosidase activity than the full length promoter- lacz fusion  , whereas deletion of sequences upstream of the bopa promoter did not have a significant effect on the level of activation .

bprp directly activates bsan and bsam
in the hierarchical control of t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> expression, bspr was suggested to activate the expression of bprp <cit> . previously, bprp was shown to bind sequences upstream of bsam and bsan   <cit> , suggesting that it directly activates their transcription. bsan is the first orf of the putative operon that encodes structural components of t3ss <dig>  and is divergently transcribed from bsam. to better understand how bsan expression itself is controlled, we examined the relationships to its upstream regulators bspr and bprp using the lacz fusion assay as described previously  <cit> . plasmids with either bspr or bprp under arabinose induction control were introduced into e. coli containing plasmids with either a bsan-lacz fusion or a bsam-lacz fusion. a bprp-lacz fusion served as control for bspr regulation. the ability of bspr and bprp to directly activate bsan-lacz, bsam-lacz and bprp-lacz expression was determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity. as expected, bprp activated both the bsam and bsan promoters in e. coli . the presence of bprq, a gene immediate downstream from bprp, had no effect on the activity of bprp. furthermore, bprp did not activate its own promoter in e. coli . however, bspr was not able to activate the promoter of bprp demonstrating that this regulator is not active in e. coli or that additional factors are required for activation .

analysis of bsan/bica-regulated virulence loci
bsan/bica directly induces the expression of three known t3ss <dig> effector loci, bopa, bopc and bope. recent studies suggest that the t3ss <dig> effectors bopc and bope are involved in invasion of epithelial cells and endosome escape  <cit> , <cit> , <cit> , while bopa has been implicated in escape from autophagy  <cit> . bopc was recently shown to be secreted via t3ss <dig> in b. pseudomallei k <dig>  <cit> , and our data confirm this . in b. pseudomallei khw, mutation of bopa, bopc or bope <cit>  individually resulted in no detectable difference in numbers of bacteria inside raw <dig>  mouse macrophages when measured 2 hr. after infection . upon extended incubation times, however, the Δbopa and the Δbopace <cit>  strains exhibited an intracellular replication defect that was intermediate between levels observed for wildtype khw and the Δbsam <cit>  or Δbsan mutant derivatives. no differences in intracellular growth or host cell cytotoxicity were observed for the bopc or bope mutant strains, although infection with the bopa or bopace triple deletion mutants resulted in a decrease in cytotoxicity  that coincided with a reduction in the rate of intracellular replication , suggesting that intracellular replication results in host cell toxicity. this is in contrast to the t3ss <dig> Δbsam and the Δbsan regulatory mutants in strain khw, which are limited in their ability to multiply intracellularly as previously reported .

three bsan/bica-activated orfs are located between the t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> loci, and upstream of the t3ss <dig> effector gene bopc. we analyzed these orfs for potential roles in intracellular replication and cell-to-cell spread. bpss <dig> encodes tssm, was previously shown to be secreted independently of t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> and functions as a broad-base deubiquitinase, with activity on tnfr-associated factor- <dig>  tnfr-associated factor- <dig>  and iκbα  <cit> . bpss <dig> is predicted to encode a short  protein of unknown function and was not secreted under our assay conditions . fole  encodes a putative gtp cyclohydrolase i, suggesting a role in tetrahydrofolate biosynthesis rather than in virulence. consistent with this notion, Δ mutant did not exhibit defects in cell-based virulence assays .

discussion
t3sss and t6sss play important roles in bacterial-host cell interactions  <cit> , <cit> . as each system is a complex structure encoded by  <dig> or more genes, it is expected that their expression and assembly would be tightly regulated. in b. pseudomallei, t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> gene clusters are highly induced following host cell infection  <cit> , and their function is critical for virulence in animal models  <cit> , <cit> . t3ss <dig> has been shown to promote escape from endocytic vesicles, and t6ss <dig> plays a key role in promoting intercellular spread by fusion of adjacent cell membranes, leading to the formation of mngcs that can be found in melioidosis patients  <cit> . upregulation of t3ss <dig> is mediated by a signalling cascade initiating from bspr through bprp, which in turn increases the expression of the arac-type regulator bsan. using global transcriptome and promoter activation analysis, we have shown that the bsan regulon occupies a central position in modulating the expression of t3ss <dig>  t6ss <dig> and several additional loci that are likely involved in promoting virulence and intracellular survival.

regulatory factors may act to control expression by acting directly on a given gene, or indirectly by modulating a regulatory intermediate. we found that bsan in complex with the t3ss <dig> chaperone bica directly controls the expression of  <dig> loci in a region of chromosome  <dig> containing t6ss <dig> and t3ss <dig> accessory genes . bsan/bica activated transcription of the operons encoding t3ss <dig> effector proteins, the bipbcd translocon complex, chaperones, and other transcriptional regulators, as well as two genes of unknown function . bsan/bica upregulates expression of t6ss <dig> by activating the transcription of the two component regulatory system loci virag and bprc, which in turn induce the hcp and tssab loci, encoding t6ss <dig> tube and sheath proteins  <cit> , <cit> . interestingly, our rnaseq and qrt-pcr analyses revealed that bsan also acts to repress transcription of t3ss <dig> apparatus genes in the bsam and bsan operons that are otherwise directly activated by the upstream regulator bprp. it is possible that bsan mediates repression indirectly as the bsam and bsan intergenic region lacks a recognizable bsan binding motif . it is unlikely, however, that repression occurs due to decreased expression of bprp since its transcription is unchanged in a Δbsan mutant. taken together, these findings demonstrate that bsan plays a dual role in the regulation of t3ss3; one in coordinating translocon and effector transcription, and a second in preventing costly synthesis of t3ss <dig> apparatus components that are no longer required. given the critical role of t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig> in causing disease, bsan/bica could be considered a central regulator of b. pseudomallei mammalian virulence. virulence studies in mice support this notion, since the Δbsan mutant was unable to cause disease  <cit>  in contrast to the Δbspr mutant, which produced a more chronic infection in mice compared to wildtype bacteria  <cit> .

in addition to loci associated with t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig>   <dig> other genes with potential roles in virulence were also found by rnaseq to be positively regulated by bsan, most notably the bimbcad intracellular motility operon and tssm. regulation of bima has been shown to be through virag <cit> , explaining why no bsan motif was identified for the operon. while bima encodes an autotransporter protein that nucleates and polymerizes host cell actin to facilitate intracellular motility and cell-cell spread by the bacteria  <cit> , the functions of the other loci in the bim operon are unknown. tssm has been shown to suppress host nfκb and type i interferon pathways  <cit> . tssm is expressed and secreted inside cells following infection with b. mallei <cit> , however, secretion occurs independently of t3ss <dig> and t6ss <dig>  <cit> . bsan was also found to activate expression of a putative non-ribosomal peptide synthase /polyketide synthase  biosynthesis locus. the diversity of polyketides, pkss and nrps/pks hybrid systems was recently reviewed by hertweck  <cit> . the b. pseudomallei locus is similar in gene content to that of a recently described plasmid encoded nrps/pks system in the marine bacterium alteromonas macleodii, which was suggested to produce a bleomycin-related antibiotic unlike a. macleodii, the gene encoding the putative bleomycin-family resistance protein  is not co-localized with the nrps/pks gene cluster, although they are similarly regulated by bsan .

bsan is homologous to the salmonella typhimurium invf, shigella flexneri mxie and the yersinia enterocholitica ysab transcriptional regulators  <cit> – <cit> . all belong to the arac/xyls family of transcriptional regulators, which act in complex with a chaperone to activate their respective t3ss genes. the chaperones not only serve as cognate partners to the transcriptional activators but also pair with t3ss translocase proteins, which are secreted into the host membrane to facilitate the injection of effector proteins  <cit> . we currently, have no understanding of the timed mechanism that frees bica and allows it to partner with bsan. the s. typhimurium chaperone sica was shown to partition the translocase sipb and sipc, and it is sequestered by sipb  <cit> . once apparatus assembly is complete, translocases are secreted and sica is free to complex and thus activate invf. the invf-sica split feedback regulatory loop, which includes positive autoregulation of invf, is conserved in y. enterocholitica <cit> . however, in s. flexneri mxie-dependent activity is inhibited via sequestration by the t3ss substrate ospd <dig> when the apparatus is inactive  <cit> . only when ospd <dig> is secreted, can mxie partner with its chaperone ipgc to activated transcription of effector genes.

regulation by bsan-bica is distinct from the previously described systems. the designation of bsan-bica as a dual-function regulatory protein complex is illustrated by its role in activating t3ss effector and accessory genes while repressing the system’s structural and secretion components as summarized in figure  <dig>  bsan was also found to suppress the transcription of  <dig> additional genes in the b. pseudomallei genome including those belonging to the fla <dig> flagellar and chemotaxis locus on chromosome  <dig> . fla <dig> is the sole flagellar system in southeast asian b. pseudomallei strains such as khw, in contrast to australian b. pseudomallei isolates which possess a complete second system encoded on chromosome  <dig>   <cit> , <cit> . the conserved fla <dig> locus encodes polar flagella and was shown to be responsible for swimming in liquid medium and swarming in soft agar, but played no role in intracellular motility following infection  <cit> . moreover, we were intrigued to find that bsan suppresses a second pks/nrps cluster  , where almost identical homologs were identified in b. mallei and b. thailandensis by biggins et al. and shown to produce an iron-chelating siderophore called malleilactone  <cit> . disruption of the mal cluster in b. thailandensis reduced lethality following infection of c. elegans, and purified malleilactone was toxic to mammalian cells at micromolar concentrations. how the function of mal fits within an overall regulatory framework that promotes virulence is not clear, although it is conceivable that bsan-mediated suppression of mal reduces the production of toxic products during infection, thereby promoting long term survival within eukaryotic hosts. alternatively, malleilactone itself may regulate virulence factor production similar to that reported for the p. aeruginosa siderophore pyoverdine  <cit> .

until recently, bopa and bope were the only two known t3ss effector proteins in b. pseudomallei. the dearth of effectors is surprising when compared to other intracellular pathogens such as shigella and salmonella that are known to possess numerous effectors. we have independently identified bopc  as a new t3ss <dig> effector based on its regulatory control by bsan/bica. bopc is transcribed in an operon encoding its chaperone  and a transposase  that are also activated by bsan/bica. incidentally, we had previously predicted by a genome-wide screen that bpss <dig> would encode a t3ss effector based on genomic colocalization with t3ss chaperones  <cit> . the bsan regulatory motif we found in the promoters of the effectors was also recently reported to be associated with t3ss <dig> in a condition-dependent transcriptome study  <cit> . of the t3ss3-linked effector proteins; bopa, bopc and bope, our results suggest that bopa is the most critical for promoting cellular infection, consistent with prior studies linking bopa to intracellular survival of b. pseudomallei and b. mallei <cit> , <cit> , <cit> . no cellular phenotype was evident following infection with Δbopc or Δbope deletion mutants, and the Δbopace triple effector mutant was indistinguishable from the Δbopa single deletion strain. as with bope and bopc, no roles were observed for the bsan-regulated effector candidate loci bpss1513- <dig> in cell-based virulence assays. bpss <dig> encodes a hypothetical protein and bpss <dig> is annotated as fole, a predicted gtp cyclohydrolase. based on their genomic organization, the transcription of these loci is likely driven from the promoter upstream of bpss <dig> tssm. the secretion of ha-tagged bpss <dig> was not detected in in vitro secretion assays, although it is possible that the epitope tag could have interfered with secretion of bpss <dig>  or that the assay was not performed at conditions permissive for secretion. it is intriguing why these three genes are placed under bsan/bica regulation by the bacterium. one possibility could be that they are important under specific stress conditions or during chronic infection.

CONCLUSIONS
elucidating the scope of the bsan regulon significantly enhances our understanding of b. pseudomallei pathogenic mechanisms. bsan orchestrates the temporal and spatial expression of virulence determinants during progression through the intracellular lifecycle, promoting endosome escape and possibly evasion of autophagy through activation of t3ss <dig> effector loci, facilitating cell-cell spread by activation of t6ss <dig> and the bim intracellular motility loci, and suppressing cellular immunity via the action of the tssm ubiquitin hydrolase. bsan also suppresses other loci that are potentially counterproductive following intracellular localization, such as the fla <dig> flagellar motility and chemotaxis locus, which could lead to activation of cellular immunity pathways through pamp recognition. it is likely that the bsan regulon and other virulence determinants that promote pathogenesis in higher mammals have been shaped primarily as a result of interactions with free-living protozoa, similar to what is believed to be the case for l. pneumophila <cit> . indeed, many of the same bsan-regulated systems, namely t3ss and t6ss, are thought to act as “anti-predation determinants” that facilitate endosome escape and promote survival within bacteriovorus amoebae by manipulating eukaryotic pathways that are conserved from protists to humans  <cit> . the dual regulatory roles of bsan – that of an activator and a suppressor – indicate that it is a key node in a regulatory program that successfully enables an environmental saprophyte to transition from the soil to surviving intracellularly.
