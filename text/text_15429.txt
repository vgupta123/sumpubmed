BACKGROUND
tropical rainforests account for only 7 % of the earth’s land surface, yet they cover over 50 % of all known plant and animal species and provide a variety of key resources and ecosystem services to humans, including food, drinking water, timber and medicines . soil microbial communities are expected to be particularly complex under tropical rainforests  <cit> . a deep analysis of soil microbial communities and their roles in ecological processes would improve our understanding of biogeochemical elemental cycles in the tropical rainforests  <cit> .

recent years, there are many reports about microbial community structure based on 16s rrna sequences or single functional groups in different environments  <cit> . in the amazon and other tropical rainforest environments, some studies of soil microbial community composition were mainly examined based on the microbial phylogenetic diversity . however, integrated understanding of environmental microbial biogeographic patterns and their ecosystem function is difficult  <cit> . therefore, it is needed to explore the microbial functional gene diversity and metabolic potential to detect environmental microbial metabolic processes  <cit> . geochip  <dig> , containing almost all of the key functional genes related to biogeochemical cycles, can be used as a specific and sensitive tool for studying microbial gene diversity and metabolic potential . correlations between environmental microbial communities and ecosystem processes have successfully been used in different ecosystems .

nitrogen concentration has an important effect on soil microbial community structure and function with further consequences for ecosystem processes  <cit> . in the last several decades, human activities of deforestation, fossil fuel and fertilizer uses have affected the nitrogen  cycling and changed n deposition rate  <cit> , resulting in increased emissions of n at least fourfold over the last century  <cit> . elevated atmospheric n deposition is generally considered to significantly alter species composition, nutrient imbalance, nitrate leaching, loss of biodiversity  <cit> . a number of experiments have been performed to investigate effects of increased input of n on soil microbial community of tropical forests. these studies showed that n enrichment would alter soil microbial community composition and provide feedbacks on soil c pools  <cit> . however, the microbial ecological process related to n cycling and the key controlling factors in tropical rainforest are unclear. therefore, it is necessary to discuss microbial functional gene diversity, especially involved in n cycling, and corresponding influencing factors.

jianfengling forest area   covering  <dig> km <dig>  <cit> , is situated in southwestern hainan island, which is a global biodiversity hotspot area  <cit> , and is one of a few areas in china where primary tropical rainforest is preserved. the forest area is heavily affected by n deposition, with over  <dig> kg n ha- <dig> yr1- <dig> deposited on hainan island from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we selected three sampling sites in the primary tropical rainforest in jianfengling and analyzed the soil microbial functional gene diversity and metabolic potential using geochip  <dig> . the aims were to determine  soil microbial functional gene diversity and metabolic potential in primary tropical rainforest soils;  major environmental factors in governing the soil microbial functional gene diversity.

RESULTS
plant communities and soil properties
according to , plant dominant species and plant species diversity were distinctly different among three sampling sites. the jfl- <dig> and jfl- <dig> had the highest and lowest shannon-weaver index, respectively. the pca showed that three sampling sites were well separated from each other , indicated that they had distinct plant community structure. soil ph was acidity , and soil moisture was over 30 % in three sampling sites. for the soil nutrient properties, these sites were also different. the jfl- <dig> had the highest contents in soil total nitrogen and available nitrogen. therefore, plant communities and soil properties had differences among three sampling sites.

these results showed that all of the metabolic processes soil bacteria mediated of related to carbon degradation, carbon fixation and methane cycle existed in these tropical rainforest soils, and some key functional gene abundances were significantly different , which could lead to the differences of soil microbial metabolic potential among these sampling sites.

relationship between soil microbial functional gene structure and environmental variables
canonical correspondence analysis  was used to analyze the relationship between the microbial functional gene structure and the major environmental variables , resulting in a significant model at a confidence level of p =  <dig> . the first axis was the most negatively and significantly correlated with soil available n, followed by total phosphorus. the second axis was the most positively and significantly correlated with plant diversity, followed by total nitrogen . therefore, n, especially soil available n, was the most correlated with soil microbial communities at the functional gene level.fig.  <dig> the linkage of soil microbial communities and environmental variables. . canonical correspondence analysis  of soil microbial communities and environmental variables based on geochip data,  multivariate regression tree  of soil microbial communities associated with three sampling sites. the units of available n and plant diversity were mg/kg and 1; n,  <dig>  represented the sample number and relative error, respectively



multivariate regression tree  analysis is well suitable for complex ecological datasets with high-order interactions in a visualized tree  <cit> . for the mrt analysis, dissimilarity was used to split data into two groups based on one of the environmental variables. each split was described graphically as a branch in a tree. each branch was labeled with response environmental variable that was placed in that branch. we compared the results of mrt using the whole geochip data and environmental variables . in this tree, soil microbial communities at the functional gene level were first split by soil available n, followed by plant species diversity. according to the relationship between environmental factors and microbial functional gene structure, soil available n could be the major factors in shaping the microbial functional structure in these sampling sites, followed by plant species diversity, similar to the cca result.

discussion
geochip-based data provided a lot of information on different biogeochemical processes, which contributed to explore soil microbes potentially effects on soil enzyme activities or components. in this study, we analyzed soil microbial functional gene structure using geochip  <dig> , and detected microbial functional gene categories, which could represent the in situ metabolic potential to some degree  <cit> . soil carbon cycling is one of the most important and complex processes in biogeochemical cycles  <cit> . in our study, the gene number of functional genes related to carbon cycling accounted for over 40 % of all genes detected, suggested that these tropical rainforest soils might have a strong metabolic potential for carbon cycling.

humid tropical forest soils have the fastest degradation rates of plant litter  <cit> , conducted by soil microorganisms with highly efficient carbon degrading ability. for example, cellulose enzyme activity related to cellulose gene variants  <cit>  and oxidizable organic carbon was significantly linked to the relative abundance of genes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose and starch degradation  <cit> . carbon degradation gene categories for substrates ranging from labile carbon  to recalcitrant carbon  were all detected in three sampling sites. the relative abundance of most functional genes involved in recalcitrant carbon degradation  was distinctly different among the three sampling sites, which indicated that the metabolic potential of degrading recalcitrant carbon for soil microbial communities was discrepant from three sampling sites in tropical rainforest. in addition, the relative abundance of genes related to active carbon degradation was not significantly different among the sampling sites, except for pullulanase gene, which indicated that soil microbes related to labile carbon degradation could execute similar carbon substrates. therefore, tropical rainforest soils may contain a series of complex, adaptable microbial metabolic communities involved in degradation of different substrates.

p cycling played a key role in changing the species composition, diversity and productivity in tropical rainforests. in this study, we detected a high relative abundance of phy, ppk and ppx genes . microbial mineralization of phytate, which is the most abundant compound containing organic p in soil, is a key process for recycling p by phytases in the biosphere  <cit> . at present, four classes of phytases have been defined in terrestrial organisms: histidine acid phosphatase, cysteine phytase, purple acid phosphatase and β–propeller phytase  <cit> . ppk encodes polyphosphate kinase, which could be used to reflect the potential for biological p removal  <cit> . ppx encodes exopolyphosphatase, catalyzing the polyphosphate transfer to phosphate. the tropical rainforests are considered to be p limited  <cit> , since elevated atmospheric n deposition may further lead to p limitation  <cit> . experimental p additions in tropical rainforests have revealed that microbial utilization for the labile fractions of soil organic c could be restricted or controlled by soil p  <cit> . moreover, p-induced variation in microbial communities could cause corresponding shifts in the functional and metabolic potentials of the communities, resulting in a change in decomposition rates  <cit> . the cca result also indicated that soil total phosphorus played a key role in soil microbial communities . in general, a highly efficient bacterial community structure and metabolic potential was formed to adapt to p limitation in the tropical rainforest.

soil microbes are the major drivers of soil n cycling, including n fixation, nitrification, denitrification, ammonification, assimilatory n reduction and dissimilatory n reduction  <cit> . in our study, we found a high metabolic potential for nitrate reduction, especially a high relative abundance of the narg gene, which could be caused by the high rate of n deposition in forest soils  <cit> . some tropical forests were observed to be n saturated and exhibited a high nitrate leaching rate in the region of high n deposition region  <cit> , particularly the old-growth forest  <cit> . nitrogen from ammonium  is the dominant n form in bulk deposition, however, the increasing rate for n deposition is the highest from nitrate   <cit> . to decrease no <dig> - concentrations in soil, a strong metabolic potential for denitrification is needed. high soil n2o fluxes were observed  in the jfl  <cit> , which were significantly higher than temperate spruce forest in germany, tropical rainforests in australia and indonesia, and un-grazed semi-arid steppe in china  <cit> . therefore, microbial communities from the tropical rainforest had a highly efficient metabolic potential in satisfying the soil n cycling.

in this study, we detected almost all the functional gene categories involved in n cycling based on geochip  <dig> . there were distinct differences in the relative abundance of different functional gene categories, indicated that metabolic potentials for different processes in n cycling were distinctly different, probably caused by n limiting factors in the ecosystem. n is the primary factor of limiting plant growth in tropical rainforests, and strong competition has been observed between plants and microorganisms  <cit> . nitrogen concentration played a key role in soil microbial community structure and function with further consequences for ecosystem processes  <cit> . n additions could directly restrict microbial growth  <cit> , relative abundance  <cit>  and microbial functional diversity  <cit> . krashevska et al. found that the soil microbial biomass and community structure were strongly altered in response to even moderate changes in n inputs in the soils of tropical rainforests, indicating that the potential was changed in causing key ramifications of the whole ecosystem including plant growth and litter decomposition through nutrient additions  <cit> . many microbial enzyme activities were changed by n condition  <cit> . for example, cellulase activity of decaying oak litter was stimulated by n addition, but lignin–degrading activity was significantly decreased  <cit> . also, n saturation could also lower soil ph, resulting in leaching of calcium and magnesium and mobilization aluminum, and then experiencing aluminum toxicity  <cit> . in our study, both cca and mrt analyses indicated that soil available nitrogen was the most important factors in influencing soil microbial community structure at the functional gene level.

in addition, microbial communities mediated soil key processes involved in carbon and nitrogen cycling, which potentially represented a mechanistic relationship between plant species diversity and ecosystem function. the availability of growth-limiting resources, such as organic compounds in dead leaves and roots  that can generate cellular energy  <cit> , influences the composition of microbial communities  <cit> . due to different biochemical composition and changes in plant diversity, plant species changes the production and range of organic compounds in detritus that influence the composition and function of heterotrophic microbial communities. zak dr, et al. conducted a long-term field manipulation to determine that the biomass, respiration and abundance of soil microbial communities significantly increased with higher plan species diversity  <cit> . the pca indicated that plant communities were distinct among three sampling sites . therefore, plant communities could have an important control in microbial community structure, verified by cca and mrt analyses.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we analyzed the soil microbial functional gene diversity and metabolic potential in the tropical rainforests of jfl by geochip technology. the metabolic processes soil bacteria mediated of related to c, n, p cycling existed in these tropical rainforest soils, and some key functional gene abundances were significantly different , which could lead to the differences of soil microbial metabolic potential among these sampling sites. a high relative abundance of genes related to ammonification, denitrification and n fixation were found in these soils. both cca and mrt showed that soil microbial functional gene structure was mainly influenced by soil available n and plant diversity. these results indicated the metabolic potential for microbial communities could acclimatize to acid tropical rainforest soils.
