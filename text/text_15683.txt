BACKGROUND
the transition from dormancy to germination in seeds is a key physiological process during the life-cycle of some plants. water uptake, seed dormancy released, embryo expansion, and radical breakthrough of seed envelopes is considered as the completion of the seed germination  <cit> . plant hormone, as a signaler, is also important for seed dormancy and germination  <cit> . ga and aba are recognized as the key internal factors, with ga promoting and aba inhibiting seed germination and dormancy  <cit> . recent studies support the fact that the aba/ga ratio regulates the metabolic transition required for dormancy release and germination . on this basis, it is inferred that other hormones such as ethylene  <cit>  and cytokinin  <cit>  also influence germination through cross-talk mechanisms.

auxin, as a versatile trigger taking part in many plant developmental processes  <cit> , also plays a critical role in root development, such as shaping the embryonic root pole, determining the root meristem size and controlling root cell elongation  <cit> . however, the biological function of auxin in seed dormancy and germination is yet to be explored. recently, a previously unrecognized regulatory factor of seed dormancy, auxin, was identified as a secondary dormancy hormone. it works with aba signaling to control seed dormancy and germination  <cit> .

numerous genes involved in dormancy and germination regulation have already been confirmed. aba receptors , protein phosphatase 2c , protein kinase  and other dormancy hormone regulators were reviewed recently  <cit> . pil5/pif <dig> has been identified as an important upstream component, which through transcriptional control of biosynthetic genes, reciprocally regulates levels of both aba and ga  <cit> , and pil <dig> was found to target promoters of various hormonal signaling genes including arf <dig>  iaa <dig>  crf <dig>  and jaz <dig>  <cit> . very recently, it was reported that auxin acts upstream of the major regulator of seed dormancy, by recruiting the auxin response factors arf  <dig> and  <dig> to control the expression of abi <dig> during seed germination  <cit> .

however, the mechanisms for the auxin regulation of seed germination process and the genetic response to exogenous auxin stimulation on a transcriptomic scale remained unknown. the aim of this study is to analyze the differential physiological process and genes expression of the auxin-controlled seed dormancy and germination using nicotiana tabacum l as the model plant. this is the first study that exogenous auxin-controlled seed dormancy and germination on a transcriptomic scale and physiological development process also would be taken into consideration.

RESULTS
seed dormancy depends on exogenous auxin levels
keeping in mind auxin control of seed dormancy in arabidopsis  <cit> , it was presumed that the exogenous high concentration of auxin might promote seed secondary dormancy in tobacco. we found that tobacco seeds soaked in 1000 mg/l indole-3-acetic acid  solution showed markedly decreased germination compared with those soaked in  <dig>   <dig> and 100 mg/l iaa solution and even unsoaked seeds .fig.  <dig> a graphical representation of exogenous auxin levels controlling seed dormancy. germination of seeds imbibed in supplementation iaa solution or ddh2o 24 h or untreated and then germinated on filter paper beds 156 h. subscript  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> indicated the concentration gradients



exogenous auxin regulates the emergence of germinated seed radicle
the effect of exogenous auxin on seed germination including water uptake, radicle emergence, endosperm burst and cotyledons unfolding assay were analyzed. the result showed that vacuoles of seeds imbibed in 1000 mg/l iaa solution could not properly unfold compared with that in ddh2o . also the radicle traits, which included the radicle weight, length and surface area, were significantly weaker , but there was no significant difference in β- <dig> glucanase activity . the radicle of all the seeds did not emerge even when approximately half of the cotyledons unfolded in the germination process.fig.  <dig> an electron micrograph showing  seed secondary dormancy, vacuole of the seeds not fully expanded, and many follicles bubble were found in cells of the seeds that treated with iaa  24 h,  seed germinating, vacuole of seeds treated with ddh2o 24 h and vacuole of which completely expanded

the effect of exogenous iaa on content of endogenous hormones including aba, ga, and iaa were examined. the dynamic changes in aba, ga1+ <dig> and iaa in three germination stages were shown in fig.  <dig>  the result indicated that there was no significant difference in aba content between seeds imbibed in gradient concentration of auxin solution and those soaked in ddh2o, in all three germination stages . however, the ga1+ <dig>  and iaa  contents were significantly higher, especially in the first stage.fig.  <dig> endogenous aba , ga1+ <dig>  and iaa  hormones’ content of tobacco seed imbibed in supplementation iaa solution or ddh2o 24 h or untreated and then germinated on filter paper beds 144 h. subscript  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> indicate the concentration gradients



transcriptome analysis of exogenous auxin controlled seed dormancy and germination
figure  <dig> shows the phenotype of  <dig> and 156 h germinating tobacco seeds and fig.  <dig> illustrates the process flux of the rna-seq experiment. as shown, three replications of  <dig> or 1000 mg/l iaa imbibed seeds that germinated after  <dig>   <dig> or 156 h  were respectively collected, mixed and then used for total rna isolation. afterwards, paired-end libraries were prepared and sequenced as described in the ‘methods’. the quality of the data and the generated sequences were checked using the fast qc software and phred measure score, respectively. the percentage of high-quality fragments was >80 % in all cases . the mapped data generated was shown in table  <dig>  there were seven samples in total. an average of about  <dig> million high-quality paired-end reads  for all rna-seq samples were generated. we got approximately  <dig> million reads pairs, which are more than  <dig>  billion bases. for each rna-seq sample,  <dig> – <dig>  %  of reads were mapped to the genome of n.tabacumk <dig> reference genome  <cit>  with tophat software  <cit> . following this, we used the cufflinks program  <cit>  to reassemble the mapped reads into a set of transcripts for each sample. then cuffmerge module in cufflinks was used to merge the transcripts from each sample to generate a unique transcript set, also named as unigenes. after removing the transcripts with length < 200 bp, a total of  <dig>  unigenes were detected. these unigenes had an average length of 1757 bp and n <dig> value of 2105 bp, of which the lengths ranged from 200 bp to  <dig>  bp. there were  <dig>   of the unigenes with length ≥ 1000 bp.fig.  <dig> flow chart of the rna-seq experimental procedure



for unigenes’ functional annotation, we utilized a blastx search against the ncbi nr database, with an e-value of 1e- <dig> as a cut-off. the blastx search result showed that about  <dig>   unigenes which had significant hits in the nr database was utilized. the distribution of the unigenes best blastx hit e-value is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  most of the unigenes had high similarity with nr database sequences. they include  <dig>   unigenes with e-value ≤  <dig> e- <dig>  and  <dig>   ungenes with e-value ≤  <dig> e- <dig>  the blastx best-hit of the  <dig>  unigenes showed that the first two species with the highest hits were solanum lycopericum  and solanum tuberosum , which were the most important model organisms in solanaceae. the distribution of best hits species is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  for unigenes functional classification, a blastx search against the eukaryotic orthologous groups  database was done, and it showed that  <dig>  unigenes matched with  <dig> kog clusters. as shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  kog classification showed that the largest category was ‘general function prediction only’ which was same as other studies; the following category was ‘posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones’. for gene ontology  annotation, blast2go suite was used to retrieve go terms based on the blastx search result of ncbi nr database. among the  <dig>  annotated unigenes, there were  <dig>  unigenes that were annotated with at least one go term. as a result,  <dig>  unigenes were grouped into biological process ,  <dig>  into molecular function  group and  <dig>  into cellular component  group. the unigene percentage of each go term in the three groups is shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  finally, kaas tool was used to identify pathways for the unigenes. there were  <dig>   unigenes assigned to  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  orthologs, which were classified into  <dig> kegg pathways.

to quantify the unigenes expression in each rna-seq sample, we used bowtie to map the clean rna-seq reads to all unigenes sequences, and then used express software to calculate fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped  for unigenes in each sample. to analyze the similarity of gene express patterns among these different rna-seq samples, we firstly filtered out the unigenes without any reads mapped in all samples, and then used principal component analysis  to analyze the unigenes fpkm values of all the  <dig> samples. pca plot of principal components  <dig> and  <dig> showed that the spatial distribution of h2o- <dig> and iaa- <dig>  h2o- <dig> and iaa- <dig> points was more concentrated, suggesting that these samples were more similar .fig.  <dig> a principal component analysis  chart to explore the relationship between samples using the unigene expression quantity. the more similar the samples, the spatial distribution of different colors points more concentrated



auxin-responsive dormancy seeds and primary dormancy seeds differ in their gene expression profiles
the differential expression analysis was performed by comparing untreated seeds  and auxin-imbibed seeds  with h2o-imbibed seeds , separately. at a significant level of p <  <dig>  and fold change ≥  <dig>  we identified  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes between untreated seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds . at the same condition, we also identified  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes between auxin-imbibed seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds . to determine the unigenes with differential expression pattern between untreated seeds and auxin-imbibed seeds relative to h2o-imbibed seeds, the h2o-imbibed seeds were taken as a control and then the unigene counts of the nine expression patterns were calculated.

as shown in fig.  <dig>  the percentagefc and unigenefc columns were calculated based on the unigene expression fold change, in which unigene with fold change <  <dig>  was treated as down -regulated, and fold change >  <dig>  was treated as up-regulated; the rest were treated as unchanged. the pie chart was drawn with the percentagefc values. the unigenep column was calculated based on the p-values of gene differential expression analysis, in which unigene with p-value <  <dig>  and fold change <  <dig>  was treated as down-regulated, and that with p-value <  <dig>  and fold change >  <dig>  was treated as up-regulated; the rest were treated as unchanged. in the nine expression patterns, we treated the iii/iv/vi/vii patterns as the differential expression pattern between untreated seeds and auxin-imbibed seeds relative to h2o-imbibed seeds. the iii/vii pattern had complete differential regulating tendency relative to h2o-imbibed seeds. in the iv/vi pattern, unigenes presented differential expression between auxin-imbibed seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds, but remained unchanged between untreated seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds. consequently, unigenes in these four expression patterns which could also be considered as the major causal factors that led to the difference in mechanism between primary dormancy and auxin-induced secondary dormancy, and this could be used to do functional analysis.fig.  <dig> a pie chart distribution of unigenes whose expression is altered during seed dormancy. the pie chart was drawn with the percentage of fold change values. unigenes whose expression level was significantly up-regulated or down-regulated by more than 2-fold or p-value <  <dig>  during dormancy were grouped according to their expression behavior in the two dormancy states of untreated seeds  and auxin-imbibed seeds  relative to h2o-imbibed seeds . arrows facing up or down represent up-regulated or down-regulated genes, respectively



the analyses for go and kegg pathway enrichment of genes in up-regulated or down-regulated auxin-responsive seeds were performed and it was found that these unigenes also showed different expression trend in primary dormancy seeds . there were significant enrichment of go terms related to auxin mediated signaling pathway , adenylyl-sulfate reductase activity, phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase  activity, and glutamate synthase  activity . kegg pathway enrichment analysis shown the differential express unigenes were significant enriched in plant hormone signal transduction  fatty acid elongation in mitochondria, and so on .

auxin-responsive germinating seeds and conventional germinating seeds differ in their gene expression profiles
using the same method as the dormancy experiment, a differential analysis between conventional germinated seeds  and auxin-responsive germinated seeds  relative to auxin-responsive dormancy seeds  was conducted. firstly, at a significant level of p <  <dig>  and fold change ≥  <dig>  we identified  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes between untreated seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds . at the same condition, we also identified  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated unigenes between auxin-imbibed seeds and h2o-imbibed seeds . the transcriptome comparison analysis of two germinated states seeds of conventional germinated seeds  and auxin-responsive germinated seeds  in comparison with auxin-responsive dormancy seeds  was performed. the unigenes were further classified into  <dig> expression patterns . like the different expression analysis in the dormancy seeds above, only unigenes in iii/iv/vi/vii patterns were analyzed to identify the genes with differential expression between sample iaa- <dig> and sample h2o- <dig>  these genes could also be treated as the major causal factors that led to the difference in mechanism between auxin-responsive germinated seeds and conventional germinated seeds.fig.  <dig> a pie chart distribution of unigenes whose expression is altered during seed germination. the pie chart was drawn with the percentage of fold change values. unigenes whose expression level was significantly up-regulated or down-regulated by more than 2-fold or p-value <  <dig>  during seed germination were grouped according to their expression behavior in the two germination states of h2o- <dig> seeds  and iaa- <dig> seeds  relative to iaa- <dig> seeds . arrows facing up or down represent up-regulated or down-regulated genes, respectively



the go and kegg pathway enrichment of genes in the up-regulated or down-regulated auxin-responsive germinated seeds showed that these genes had different expression trend compared with conventional germinated seeds . the enrichment of go terms were associated with aba, auxin, ja and sa-mediated signaling pathway, response to red, far red and blue light, serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity, udp-glucosyltransferase activity, and photosynthesis, etc. . the kegg enriched pathway were associated with glutathione metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis , and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .table  <dig> fold changes of significant differential expressed unigenes revealed in auxin-responsive seed dormancy and germination regulation by rna-seq and their verification by rt-pcr



genetic expression difference of auxin-responsive seed dormancy and germination in the acquainted core metabolism pathways
the crosstalk of aba and ga  <cit> , and interaction of auxin and aba  <cit>  were the most important pathways controlling seed dormancy and germination. other important dormancy regulators could be divided into four groups involved in seed maturation, hormonal action, dormancy and chromatin regulation  <cit> . to study the changes of these important genes and signal pathways, we utilized a blastx search against the ncbi nr database, the homolog unigenes of which in tobacco were identified. express patterns of these unigenes’ were obtained from differential expression analyses, and the result showed that efs, hub <dig> and ahg <dig> in auxin-responsive seed dormancy were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated .

met metabolism is a housekeeping mechanism in all organisms, and also is central to seed germination  <cit> . as the methods above, unigenes in methionine metabolism was studied. met synthase and serine acetyltransferase gene were significantly unregulated both in auxin-responsive germinated seeds and conventional germinated seeds . cysteine  synthase gene was up-regulated in auxin-responsive seed dormancy seeds and down-regulated in primary dormancy seeds .

validation of auxin-responsive genes by quantitative real-time pcr
to validate rna-seq results, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-pcr  was used to conduct the expression analysis of randomly assigned nineteen auxin-responsive genes in dormancy and germination. table  <dig> and additional file 10: table s <dig> show the comparison between the qrt-pcr and rna-seq analysis, showing that all the auxin-responsive genes tested and previously identified by rna-seq were confirmed by qrt-pcr. the results showed a significant positive correlation between the two quantitative approaches of gene expression , indicating that the rna-seq expression analysis performed is highly reliable.

discussion
seed dormancy and germination are complex biological processes which are affected by both developmental and environmental factors. auxin was recognized as a secondary dormancy hormone that controls seed dormancy and germination in arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, we found that tobacco seeds imbibed in a high concentration of exogenous auxin solution could promote seed dormancy and inhibit germination assayed by both restraining radicle protrusion and cotyledon greening. however, the microscopic scanning results implied that the seeds soaked in auxin solution were germinating as many follicles bubbles were found in cells whose vacuoles did not expand completely despite their treatment with ddh2o. the transcriptome pca results also indicated that auxin-induced seeds are more similar to the seeds treated with ddh2o when compared to the primary dormant seeds. seed dormancy has been defined as the incapacity of a viable seed to germinate under favorable conditions  <cit> . so, this exogenous auxin-mediated seed dormancy can be referred to as an environmental model that prevents seed germination in an unfavorable condition.

dormancy or germination depends on the balance between the resistance strength of the surrounding tissues and the growth force of the elongating radicle  <cit> . in this study, we found that exogenous auxin completely restrained radicle emergence, but not refrained endosperm rupture judged by the activity of β- <dig> glucanase, a specific enzyme that was necessary for endosperm rupture during tobacco seed germination . as recognized, radicle cell elongation was necessary for seed germination and was generally accepted to be sufficient for the completion of radicle protrusion, while cell division was not essential  <cit> . thus, auxin level may also be the prerequisite for radicle development and emergence during seed germination. the seeds of triple tir1afb2afb <dig> and the quadruple mutant tir1afb1afb2afb <dig>  <cit>  in arabidopsis failed to develop a hypocotyl and root meristem. therefore, high concentration of exogenous auxin in this study might also inhibit hypocotyl and root meristem development.

a recent study carried out by liu et al.  <dig> on arabidopsis, revealed that auxin and aba in seed dormancy are interdependent. auxin acted upstream of the major regulator of seed dormancy by activating the aba response, but the aba biosynthesis was not stimulated  <cit> . this study also revealed, that seeds imbibed in superfluous exogenous auxin did not show increase in aba level. ga and iaa levels significantly increased during the imbibition stage, and both of them progressively decreased in the subsequent germination stage. these findings suggest that seed in order to release form the dormant state, more ga synthesis is required to antagonize the application of the auxin. the ga pathway was shown to have been subjected to regulation by auxin, and the auxin promotes arabidopsis root growth by modulating gibberellin response  <cit> . gas, although required for the completion of germination, are not directly involved in many processes taking place during germination, which occurred at a stage coinciding with or very close to radicle emergence  <cit> . so, the exogenous auxin application might significantly promoted dormancy by activating the aba response during seed dormancy, and also inhibited the radicle development and emergence by modulating gibberellin response during seed germination.

the induction of seed dormancy is controlled by a diverse group of regulators, which can be divided into four groups that may be involved in: i. seed maturation, ii. hormonal action, iii. dormancy and iv. chromatin regulation  <cit> . in present study, we found that a hormonal regulator ahg <dig> was significantly down-regulated. ahg3/atpp2ca functions as a negative regulator in the aba-signaling pathway, suggesting that it plays a major role in aba signaling in seed germination and early growth of arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, expression levels of two epigenetic regulators efs and hub <dig> were significantly up-regulated in this study. the efs gene has been selected as a phase transition regulator during seed germination in a transcriptional network modelling study, and the mutant efs seeds also show a variety of seed phenotypes including precocious germination  <cit> . the rdo4/hub <dig> gene was initially identified on the basis of its reduced dormancy phenotype  <cit> .

met metabolism is metabolism central for seed germination  <cit> . during seed germination of arabidopsis , rice  <cit> , and peas  <cit> , met synthase or adometsynthetase accumulation increased. in arabidopsis, studies have shown that the accumulation level of met synthase strongly increased prior to radicle emergence, but no further increase was observed during radicle emergence . in this study, met synthase and adometsynthetase gene were significantly up-regulated . serine acetyltransferase is a crucial enzyme in cys synthesis metabolism that was significantly up-regulated in auxin-responsive germinated seeds. cys is a precursor of met biosynthesis  <cit>  and constitutes a building block contributing to protein structure through the formation or reduction of disulfide bonds as catalyzed by trxs. it is well documented that these enzymes affect a myriad of proteins during germination  <cit> . cys is also the precursor of the major antioxidant molecule glutathione , which is involved in several processes playing a role in germination. the gsh-ascorbate cycle  <cit>  or the formation of s-nitroso glutathione , or a storage form of no plays a pivotal role in seed physiology  <cit> . above all, auxin-responsive germination refers to an enhanced met pathway in the transcriptome.

CONCLUSIONS
unlike controlling of seed dormancy by exogenous aba in a microscale, this exogenous auxin-mediated seed dormancy is more likely to be an environmental model that prevents seed germination in an unfavorable condition. compared to the cotyledon, the radicle was more sensitive to exogenous auxin stimulation. radicles of seeds that imbibed in 1 g/l exogenous auxin solution could not develop normally and emerge. in response to exogenous auxin stimulation, seeds would stimulate more ga synthesis to antagonize the effect of auxin. as the auxin level decreased, seeds recovered from the dormancy status to a germination status. principal component analysis revealed that the transcriptome of auxin-responsive dormancy seeds was more similar to that of imbibed seeds when compared to primary dormancy seeds. and the transcriptome of auxin-responsive germinated seeds was more similar to that of conventional germinated seeds when compared to auxin-responsive dormancy seeds. to obtain the signaling pathways induced by auxin, the unigenes of showed differential expression between untreated seeds and auxin-imbibed seeds relative to h2o-imbibed seeds were chosen, was used to do gene function analysis. auxin-responsive dormancy was associated with flavonol biosynthetic process, gibberellin metabolic process, adenylyl-sulfate reductase activity, thioredoxin activity, glutamate synthase  activity and chromatin regulation. auxin-responsive germination responded to aba, auxin, ja and sa mediated signaling pathway , glutathione and methionine metabolism, of which most importantly we found that the auxin-responsive secondary seed dormancy refers to epigenetic regulation and germination to enhance met pathway. our study, thus, uncovers a previously unrecognized transcriptional regulatory networks and physiological development processes of seed dormancy and germination with superfluous auxin signal activate.
