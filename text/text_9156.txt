BACKGROUND
tgf-β is a multifunctional cytokine that plays important patho-physiological roles in mammals. there are three mammalian isoforms that are involved in several developmental processes as has been shown by the knock-out mice models  <cit> . tgf-β has a major role to play in the initiation and progression of cancer. this is supported by several studies which have shown defects in various components of the tgf-β signalling pathway in many cancers  <cit> . tgf-β has a dual role in carcinogenesis  <cit> . initially it acts as a tumour suppressor and causes growth arrest of epithelial cells and cells in the early stages of cancer  <cit> . but in an established tumour, tgf-β exerts an effect which is favourable for the survival, progression and metastasis of the tumour  <cit>  by promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition , angiogenesis and escape from immune surveillance  <cit> . studies using mouse models have shown that an intact tgf-β signalling is essential for the metastasis of breast cancer  <cit> . these observations indicate that the normal epithelial cells show differential response to tgf-β as compared to the tumour they give rise to. supporting this, it has been shown that prostate tumour cells show invasion in response to tgf-β and not non-tumourigenic cells  <cit> . differential gene expression mediated by tgf-β has been reported in tumour cells and normal cells. for example, in response to tgf-β, tumour cells show increase in the production of proteases and down regulation of the inhibitors of proteases, whereas this is not observed in the normal cells  <cit> . however, there is no clear understanding of the mechanism  responsible for differential responses of various cell types to tgf-β. since a role for tgf-β has been established in several pathological conditions, this pathway is a very attractive target for therapeutic intervention. this requires identification of targets of tgf-β in different cell-types and their mechanism of regulation, particularly in un-transformed and transformed cells. in this study, we show differential regulation of several genes by tgf-β in two different cell-lines, hpl1d and a <dig> and also propose a significant role for the map kinase pathway in tgf-β mediated gene regulations.

RESULTS
gene expression profiling of hpl1d and a <dig> cells in response to tgf-β
to identify the tgf-β regulated genes in normal and tumour cells, we chose hpl1d and a <dig> cells. hpl1d is an immortalized lung epithelial cell-line that is growth inhibited by tgf-β, similar to many epithelial cells  <cit> . a <dig> is a lung adenocarcinoma cell-line that has been known to respond to tgf-β treatment  <cit> . the cells were treated with human recombinant tgf-β  <dig> for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and the rnas extracted from these cells were used for microarray experiments using human  <dig> k arrays. genes which were either up  or down regulated  at any one of the time points have been considered as regulated by tgf-β in the respective cell-line. in hpl1d,  <dig> genes were regulated by tgf-β treatment and of these,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated. in a <dig>   <dig> genes were regulated by tgf-β and of these,  <dig> genes were up regulated and  <dig> genes were down regulated by tgf-β treatment. the log <dig> transformed data of the genes regulated by tgf-β in hpl1d and a <dig> cells are shown as hierarchical cluster diagrams . the expression profiling data of hpl1d and a <dig> in response to tgf-β has been submitted to gene expression omnibus .

comparison of gene expression profiles of hpl1d and a <dig> in response to tgf-β
when the gene expression profiles of hpl1d and a <dig> cell-lines in response to tgf-β  <dig> were compared, it was found that  <dig> genes were regulated in both the cell-lines in a similar manner but with different kinetics. the list of genes regulated commonly in both hpl1d and a <dig> is shown in additional file  <dig> . a hierarchical cluster diagram is shown in figure 2a and a venn diagram depicting the number of genes commonly and differentially regulated in a <dig> and hpl1d are shown in figure 2b.  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated by tgf-β in a <dig> cells,  and  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated by tgf-β in hpl1d cells . representative clusters of each of the sub-classes of genes are shown in figure 2c.

validation of microarray results by qrt-pcr
the microarray data have been validated by real time and semi-quantitative rt-pcr. tmepa, tgfbip, igfbp <dig>  integrin α v, tsp- <dig>  mmp <dig> and tgm <dig> were studied by real time qrt-pcr as described in the methods. the primer sequences used for qrt-pcr are shown in table  <dig>  any gene is considered as regulated by tgf-β if qrt-pcr results showed > two fold regulation as compared to untreated cells. as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  tmepa, tgfbip and mmp <dig> are regulated by tgf-β  <dig> in both hpl1d and a <dig> cell-lines. in hpl1d, induction of tgfbip and tmepa by tgf-β is seen after  <dig> hours of treatment and increases with prolonged incubation. the induction of mmp <dig> by tgf-β is seen  <dig> hours onwards, whereas, there is no regulation of the genes igfbp <dig>  tsp- <dig>  tgm <dig> after tgf-β treatment. integrin αv, showed a  <dig>  fold regulation after  <dig> hours of treatment with tgf-β. in a <dig>  the induction of all these genes except tgm <dig> is observed after  <dig> hours of treatment and increase progressively with time, whereas, the induction of tgm <dig> increases till  <dig> hours and then declines. in addition, regulation of few other genes by tgf-β such as fibronectin  <dig>  zf <dig>  s100a <dig>  tβ ri, acta <dig>  t-plastin, keratin  <dig> and v-jun were assessed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . the data suggest that all these genes are regulated by  <dig>  –  <dig>  fold in hpl1d cells . however, in a <dig> cells, the regulation of zf <dig>  acta <dig>  keratin  <dig>  tβ ri and v-jun is >  <dig>  fold whereas, fn <dig>  t-plastin and s100a <dig> is  <dig> – <dig>  fold .

functional categories of genes regulated by tgf-β in hpl1d and a549
the lists of the regulated genes were fed into david database  regulation of actin cytoskeleton ,  focal adhesion  and  wnt signalling pathways . in a <dig>  tgf-β modulated genes belong to  map kinase signalling ,  tight junction ,  adherans junction   focal adhesion   insulin signalling   regulation of actin cytoskeleton  and  wnt signalling .

effect of inhibiting the mapk pathways on the tgf-β mediated gene regulation
tgf-β modulates gene expression through phosphorylation of smad proteins. however, several studies show a role for map kinase pathway in tgf-β mediated gene regulation both in a smad dependent and independent manner  <cit> . hence, inhibitors of map kinase pathway components, sb <dig> , pd <dig>  and jnk inhibitor 1-l form were used to assess the role of p <dig>  erk and jnk pathways in the regulation of gene expression by tgf-β. in a <dig> cells, regulation of igfbp <dig> by tgf-β is independent of the p <dig>  erk and the jnk pathways. induction of integrin αv, mmp <dig>  tmepa and tgm <dig> by tgf-β is partially dependent on the erk pathway; and mmp <dig>  tgfbip, tgm <dig> and tsp- <dig> regulation by tgf-β is partially dependent on the p <dig> pathway. the induction of integrin αv is partially affected by blocking the jnk pathway . in hpl1d cells, intgerin αv, mmp <dig> and tgfbip regulation by tgf-β is affected by blocking the p <dig> map kinase pathway, none of the gene regulations by tgf-β seem to be affected by blocking the erk pathway and the induction of tmepa by tgf-β is dependent on the jnk pathway .

effect of blocking the integrin-linked signalling pathway in a <dig> cells
apart from the various signalling pathways and phenomena modulated by tgf-β in both normal and tumour cells, a pathway which is likely be differentially regulated is the integrin-αv linked signalling pathway. integrin αv is induced by tgf-β in a <dig> cells to about  <dig>  fold as compared to  <dig>  fold in hpl1d. integrin αv is known to mediate some actions of tgf-β  <cit> . in order to test if some of the genes regulated by tgf-β are due to activation of integrin αv, the activation of this pathway was blocked by treating the cells with  <dig> μg/ml of grgdnp peptide, a known integrin pathway inhibitor, prior to treatment with tgf-β. it was found that the induction of tsp- <dig>  which is a tgf-β regulated gene only in a <dig> cells, is affected by blocking the integrin-linked signalling pathway . blocking this pathway had no effect on the regulation of the other genes tested. this suggests that the integrin pathway is also responsible for differential regulation of some genes by tgf-β in the two cell-types, hpl1d and a <dig> 

discussion
most actions of tgf-β are brought about by regulation of gene expression. the genes, which are regulated and the way they are regulated are largely dependent on the cell-type under consideration. over the past few years, there have been several independent transcriptome analyses of cells in response to tgf-β treatment. in cells of epithelial origin like human keratinocytes and mouse breast epithelial cells, tgf-β modulates genes involved in emt  <cit> . in lung fibroblasts and a <dig> cells, tgf-β treatment results in the induction of extracellular matrix genes which are responsible for fibrosis as in the case of idiopathic pulmonary and alveolar epithelial fibrosis  <cit> . studies using various cells such as cervical cancer cells, corneal epithelial cells, rat intestinal epithelial cells, and dermal fibroblasts show that regulation of gene expression by tgf-β is cell-type specific  <cit> . considering the dual role of tgf-β on normal and transformed cells, wherein it confers growth inhibition and apoptosis to normal epithelial cells but aids growth and metastasis of tumour cells  <cit> , it is essential to identify the genes and/or biochemical pathways regulated by tgf-β in normal and transformed cells. an understanding of these differences may allow identification of therapeutic targets for diseases involving tgf-β signalling pathway.

with this aim, expression profiling of genes in response to tgf-β was performed in a lung adenocarcinoma cell-line  and a matched immortalized lung epithelial cell-line . the experimental design includes treatment of the respective cells with  <dig> ng/ml tgf-β in serum free conditions for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs and extract rna for microarray experiments. in our experiments, we have used two arrays for each rna  and hence essentially these are technical duplicates. as a consequence although duplicate arrays were performed for each time point, effectively the sample size equals to  <dig> at each time point since they are technical duplicates. due to this, it is possible that many changes that are seen could be due to variations in the experimental protocols, rather than real biological differences. to overcome this, we have performed qrt-pcr validation of several genes on biological replicates that agrees with the microarray data for the respective genes. our data showed similar regulation of  <dig> genes in hpl1d and a <dig> cells by tgf-β. this suggests that the genes commonly regulated in both hpl1d and a <dig> are not tumour specific. some of these genes were also reported to be regulated by tgf-β in other studies using microarray in various cell-types  <cit>  suggesting that these tgf-β regulated genes are not tumour cell specific but generally regulated by tgf-β. while some  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated by tgf-β in a <dig>  only  <dig> genes are exclusively regulated in hpl1d cells. the reasons for this differential response are not known. however, some of the genes exclusively regulated in a <dig> such as integrin αv, thrombospondin  <dig>  α2macroglobulin have been shown to aid tumour survival, maintenance and metastasis  <cit> . in contrast, in hpl1d, tgf-β regulates tumour suppressor genes like wt <dig>  ecm proteins like collagen which are responsible for arrest of cell growth and apoptosis. this differential gene regulation in normal and tumour cells may explain the dual role of tgf-β in carcinogenesis. when the genes regulated by tgf-β in these two cell-lines were categorized based on their annotated functions, it was found that signalling pathways like map kinase, focal adhesion, wnt signalling are regulated by tgf-β in both the cell-lines. on the other hand, integrin αv was found to be differentially regulated in a <dig> and hpl1d cells.

tgf-β actions on cells are to a large extent are carried out by the phosphorylation of smad 2/ <dig> by activated tgf-β type i receptor upon tgf-β signalling. several genes that are transcriptionally regulated by tgf-β contain a smad complex binding element . however, many genes are reported to be regulated by tgf-β through an ap <dig> element  <cit> . using smad2/smad <dig> knock out fibroblast cell-lines, smad  <dig> and  <dig> independent actions of tgf-β have been reported earlier  <cit> . in addition, smad independent signalling by tgf-β mediated by other pathways like the map kinases namely the p <dig>  erk and the jnk pathways is also reported  <cit> . activation of the p <dig> and the jnk pathways by tgf-β involves a tgf-β activated kinase called tak <dig> . however, the erk pathway activation by tgf-β is not well characterized. also, cross talk between smad mediated signalling and pkc pathway has been reported  <cit> . another pathway that has been implicated in tgf-β actions is the integrin signalling pathway. it has been shown that activation of integrin β  <dig> along with αv is important for the emt mediated by tgf-β  <cit> . although, integrin αv is known to mediate some actions of tgf-β in some cell-types  <cit> , the genes regulated by tgf-β through this pathway have not been characterized. our data suggest substantial induction of integrin αv by tgf-β in only a <dig> cells and marginally in hpl1d cells. this could be an important difference between these two cell-lines for the regulation of gene expression mediated by tgf-β via this pathway. in order to understand the mechanism of regulation of some of the previously validated genes identified in the microarray experiments, specific inhibitors for the three branches of the map kinase pathway namely the p <dig>  the erk and the jnk pathways were used prior to tgf-β treatment of the cells and expression of these genes was studied by real time qrt-pcr estimation. the results suggested that in a <dig> cells, active map kinase pathways are involved in the regulation of more number of genes with relatively higher magnitude by tgf-β as compared to hpl1d cells . there could be several reasons for this observation: 1] it is known that the map kinases are constitutively active in highly malignant cells due to autocrine activation of map kinase pathways  <cit> , pi3k/akt pathways  <cit> , constitutive activation or amplification of receptors such as egfr, pdgfr etc., mechanisms  <cit> . map kinase pathway involvement in the tgf-β mediated gene regulation is well established and the constitutive activation of map kinase pathway in transformed cells could be one of the reasons for more number of genes regulated by tgf-β in a <dig> cells. 2] it could be due to activation of integrin pathway in transformed cells. it has been reported that integrin mediated fak/ilk activation is required for the regulation of emt  <cit> . our data suggesting regulation of thrombospondin  <dig> which is an emt marker  <cit>  by tgf-β via integrin pathway, could be an example of this pathway's importance in tgf-β mediated gene regulation at least with respect to genes that mediate emt. taken together, our data highlights the importance of map kinase and integrin pathways in the regulation of majority of genes by tgf-β at least in transformed cells. the role of smad pathway in the regulation of these genes that are affected by the map kinase and integrin αv inhibitors is not known. it is possible that some of these regulations that depend on non-smad pathways may also need activated smad pathway. one difference between normal and tumour cells could be the absence of an intact smad signalling pathway in tumour cells. however, in a <dig> cells, no defects in the smad pathway have been reported. in addition, we confirmed the presence of intact smad pathway in a <dig> cells by smad dependent regulation of promoter activity by tgf-β . based on our data, we propose that activated map kinase pathway could be one of the essential determining factors for the various differential actions of tgf-β in tumour cells.

a major question that remains to be addressed is whether the tgf-β mediated differential gene expression patterns in hpl1d and a <dig> cells is due to the distinct phenotypic characteristics of the respective cell-lines. from the previous studies, it is well established that tgf-β influences the growth and apoptosis of untransformed epithelial cells such as lung epithelial cells  <cit> . at least the growth inhibition by tgf-β has been less sensitive in the presence of serum  <cit>  suggesting that activation of signalling pathways by serum may antagonize tgf-β mediated growth inhibition. most apoptosis studies using tgf-β have also been carried out in minimal serum conditions . it remains to be established if apoptotic cell death mediated by tgf-β could be reversed in the presence of serum although it can be speculated that reversal of growth inhibition may allow survival of cells. one of the most important actions of the serum is activation of mitogenic pathways mediated by growth factors. also, it has been shown that serum stimulation leads to activation of map kinase pathways  <cit> . our data demonstrates that the effect of tgf-β is more pronounced in a <dig> cells as compared to hpl1d cells and one of the reasons for this could be due to constitutively active map kinase pathway in tumour cells. this is evident from our data that shows loss of tgf-β regulation of many genes following map kinase pathway specific inhibitors in a <dig> cells. a <dig> cells harbour a mutation at the 12th codon of k-ras proto-oncogene  <cit> . this mutation renders constitutive activation of ras protein resulting in active map kinase pathway in these cells. in hpl1d cells, there is no report of any mutation in the ras genes or constitutively active map kinase pathway. it is possible that this may be one of the major differences responsible for the differential regulation of genes by tgf-β in these cell-lines. hpl1d cells are growth inhibited by tgf-β  <cit> . the differential regulation of certain tumour suppressor genes , cell cycle related genes  and extracellular matrix genes  by tgf-β in hpl1d cells  points to a growth regulatory activity of tgf-β in these cells. on the other hand, as discussed previously, genes that are known to play pro-tumourigenic roles such as thrombospondin, integrins, transglutaminase, α2-macroglobulin etc. are regulated in a <dig> cells . taken together, the differential regulation of genes in a <dig> and hpl1d cells could be due to pro-tumourigenic or growth inhibitory roles of tgf-β on these cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, by microarray and real time rt-pcr experiments, we show that 1] tgf-β regulates more number of genes in transformed cells as compared to non-transformed cells; 2] evidence for differential regulation of gene expression in normal and tumour cells by tgf-β; and 3] that involvement of map kinase pathways may be one of the major mechanisms of tgf-β actions.
