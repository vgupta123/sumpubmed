BACKGROUND
amyloidoses are diseases that occur when soluble proteins undergo conformational re-arrangements and form fibrillar aggregates known as amyloid deposits. such diseases include alzheimer's, parkinson's, creutzfeldt-jacob's and huntington's neurodegenerative diseases, as well as type ii diabetes, prion diseases and many more. amyloidogenic proteins are quite diverse, with little similarity in sequence and native 3d-structure  <cit> . additionally, several proteins and peptides not related to amyloidoses have also been shown to have the potential to form amyloid fibrils in vitro, suggesting that this ability for structural rearrangement and aggregation may be inherent to proteins  <cit> .

despite the diversity of origin, all amyloid fibrils share the same cross-beta architecture and several functional proteins found in bacteria, fungi, insects and humans have also been found to adopt the same architecture under physiological conditions, as part of their functional role , following our proposal for the existence of natural protective amyloids  <cit> .

evidence indicates that short sequence stretches may be responsible for amyloid formation  <cit>  and several methods have been published recently, that attempt to predict amyloidogenic regions, based on various properties of proteins .

each method makes its own assumptions and implements its own predictors, which range from quite simplistic to quite complex. the ability to form β-strands is a predominant feature in most works, either in the form of statistical propensities or in the form of structural stability. yoon and welsh  searched for hidden beta-propensity in sequences, in other words regions that appear to be natively α-helical but have nonetheless the ability to form β-strands. hamodrakas et al.  <cit>  have similarly looked for "conformational switches" in sequences -regions with a high predicted tendency to form both α-helices and β-strands- using the consensus secondary structure prediction program secstr  <cit>  and zibaee et al.  <cit>  looked for β-contiguity, essentially a derivative of β-strand propensity based on the chou and fasman  <cit>  set of secondary structure preference values. in a more structural approach, thompson et al.  <cit>  and zhang et al.  <cit>  identified regions computationally that can be stable as β-strands in a stacked β-sheet crystal, similar to the one obtained from the peptides gnnqqny and nnqqny  <cit> , known amyloidogenic regions from the yeast prion sup <dig>  while trovato et al.  <cit> , looked for regions with the ability to pair with each other and form β-sheets, with their program termed "pasta".

the formation of β-strands is not the only predictor though. conchillo-solé et al.  <cit>  defined a set of aggregation propensities, upon which they calculate the presence of aggregation "hot-spots" in sequences. galzitskaya et al.  <cit>  also defined a novel intrinsic property for aminoacid residues, the average expected packing density, which they found to be correlated to amyloidogenesis, while lopez de la paz and serrano  <cit>  identified a sequence pattern that is involved in the formation of amyloid-like fibrils.

a variety of multi-parametric methods exist as well. pawar et al.  <cit>  and tartaglia et al.  <cit>  combine intrinsic properties of aminoacid sequences to calculate aggregation propensities, while tartaglia et al.  <cit>  and fernandez-escamilla et al.  <cit>  additionally include the effect of environmental variables in their equations for calculating aggregation rates.

we demonstrated that a consensus approach might be better suited for the task of predicting amyloidogenic stretches  <cit>  and we developed a consensus algorithm, amylpred, described below , which combines some of the these methods, representing most of the above mentioned categories.

as mentioned above, amyloidogenic proteins are quite diverse, with little similarity in sequence and native 3d-structure  <cit> . therefore, we tried to determine a common molecular denominator to all amyloid fibril favouring regions, the so-called amyloidogenic determinants, which may dictate their ability at molecular level to form amyloid fibrils. our efforts were guided by the superb work of sawaya et al.  <cit> , who reported that as many as  <dig> segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both, all form dry 'steric zippers', which are pairs of β-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated, from  <dig> crystal structures of such segments.

in this work, we examined  <dig> proteins related to amyloidoses, taken from the detailed compilations of harrison et al.  <cit>  and uversky and fink  <cit> .  <dig> of them have experimentally determined amyloidogenic regions  , and of these,  <dig> have experimentally solved structures. the remaining  <dig> proteins have experimentally solved structures, but no experimentally determined amyloidogenic regions. we thoroughly examined the experimentally solved structures and the experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants and we have found that almost all experimentally determined, and a large percentage of predicted amyloidogenic regions by our consensus prediction algorithm amylpred , which predicts amyloidogenic determinants from sequence, are only partially buried into the hydrophobic cores of the solved protein structures, thus requiring only a slight  unfolding to occur, for the formation of aggregates and subsequent formation of amyloid fibrils.

RESULTS
since proteins related to amyloidoses vary in sequence and 3d-structure and there are no profound similarities either in sequence or structure of these proteins  <cit> ,  <dig> such proteins were extracted from the detailed works of harrison et al.  <cit>  and uversky and fink  <cit>  and our attempts were focused on identifying common structural features for these proteins.

 <dig> of them have experimentally determined amyloidogenic short stretches   and they are shown in additional file  <dig>   <dig> of these  <dig> proteins, clearly indicated in additional file  <dig>  have experimentally determined 3d-structures .

the remaining  <dig> amyloidogenic proteins, shown in additional file  <dig>  have experimentally solved 3d-structures, as shown in this file, but, unfortunately, no experimentally determined amyloidogenic regions.

we developed a consensus prediction algorithm of amyloidogenic determinants, from sequence alone, called amylpred  and we wanted to compare its results against those of the five individual methods it combines. therefore, we used as a test set these  <dig> proteins and the results are presented in detail, in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  table  <dig> presents for each method separately and for the consensus method amylpred, sensitivity, specificity, the index qα and correlation coefficient values, as these measures of accuracy were defined by baldi at al.  <cit> , for the  <dig> proteins of additional file  <dig>  with experimentally verified amyloidogenic regions on a per aminoacid residue basis. it also contains actual true/false positive and true/false negative values for each method to better demonstrate the bias of each individual method. on the basis of these measures, it can be seen that, amylpred, performs slightly better than each individual method, as perhaps expected. in additional file  <dig>  the results of amylpred against those of a recently developed prediction algorithm of 'hot spots' of aggregation in polypeptides, aggrescan,  <cit>  are also compared. the results of amylpred on this test set, against those of two other recently presented prediction algorithms, pasta  <cit>  and zyggregator  <cit>  were also compared .

consensus
true/false positives  and true/false negatives  for each method are also shown to demonstrate better the bias of each individual method . the results for a consensus based on  <dig> methods are also shown.

the crystal structures of  <dig> proteins from the set of the  <dig> chosen proteins related to amyloidoses are known . of these  <dig> proteins,  <dig> have experimentally determined amyloidogenic regions, shown in yellow in figure  <dig>  which contains cartoon representations of the determined structures. these include prolactin, apolipoprotein a-i, transthyretin, lactoferrin, lysozyme c, gelsolin and β2-microglobulin. theoretically predicted amyloidogenic regions by amylpred, which coincide with experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants, are shown in red in figure  <dig>  whereas theoretically predicted amyloidogenic determinants by amylpred, but not experimentally verified as such, are shown in blue in figure  <dig> 

a close examination of the  <dig> solved protein structures  by molecular graphics programs such as o  <cit>  and pymol  <cit>  and also utilizing the algorithm dssp  <cit> , reveals that 100% of the experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants and ca. 70% of theoretically predicted by amylpred amyloidogenic determinants, have at least one 'face' of these amyloidogenic determinants on the surface of the relevant structures, clearly not buried in the hydrophobic interiors of the protein structures. this finding was somewhat unexpected and intriguing. furthermore, surprisingly, several of these 'not-buried' amyloidogenic determinants were predicted by the algorithm secstr  to have ambivalent propensities both for α-helix and β-sheet, in other words to have the properties of 'chameleon' sequences  <cit> , and, also, were observed experimentally to adopt either type of secondary structure.

quantitative estimates of total and per-residue accessible surface areas, in Å <dig>  calculated using dssp  <cit> , for the experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants, for the theoretically predicted by amylpred amyloidogenic determinants and for other peptides, either 'exposed' on the surface or 'buried' into a protein's interior are provided in additional file  <dig>  for the  <dig> amyloidogenic proteins with experimentally determined 3d-structures of additional files  <dig> & <dig>  additional file  <dig> contains quantitative estimates of total and per-residue accessible surface areas, in Å <dig>  calculated using dssp  <cit> , for 'exposed' on the surface peptides , taken from the structures of  <dig>  non-amyloidogenic globular proteins, selected at random, belonging to the structural classes α, β, α + β, α/β. it can clearly be seen from these files that all experimentally found amyloidogenic determinants and a large percentage  of theoretically predicted determinants, are, indeed, 'exposed' on the surface. however, it is also seen that this feature is not found only in proteins related to disease, but it is a property of globular proteins in general.

discussion
amyloids are formed under protein-denaturing conditions or as a result of mutations, but they have also been observed to be the native fold of certain proteins under physiological conditions. as research continues for the understanding of the mechanisms involved in amyloid formation, the development of prediction methods is an important complement to experimental approaches.

although, clearly, prediction tools cannot substitute experimental work, they might contribute in locating potential regions of interest for further experimental studies. therefore, we have developed a publicly available online tool for the prediction of amyloidogenic determinants in amino acid sequences, based on the consensus of five independent prediction methods that rely on different properties of these amyloidogenic determinant-regions. in addition, we have tested the consensus method against each of its subordinate methods on the same set of  <dig> proteins for which experimental data is available and we have found that its results tend to be slightly more accurate than those of the individual predictors.

an intriguing finding is that signal peptides, when present , tend to be detected as amyloidogenic regions, usually by  <dig> out of the  <dig> methods and consequently are also shown as strong consensus hits. we currently have no explanation as to what the relation between the two features may be, besides the highly biased hydrophobic composition of the signal peptides' central region.

it is important, however, to note that the numbers shown in table  <dig> are subject to change as more experimental data is acquired, because regions currently marked as non-amyloidogenic are not necessarily so and may prove to be in fact amyloidogenic in the future. indeed, several regions were found in these  <dig> proteins, for which there was a strong agreement among all methods but are currently marked as non-amyloidogenic. such prediction results may suggest amyloidogenic determinants currently unknown and methods like the one presented here might therefore provide valuable hints to experimental researchers. it should perhaps be mentioned at this point that, recently, we synthesized and structurally studied six  peptides from different proteins of additional file  <dig>  that the amylpred tool predicts as amyloidogenic determinants  and we have found that five  of them produce amyloid fibrils, in water, at physiological ph, temperature and ionic strength, apparently having the ability to act as amyloidogenic determinants . this, most probably indicates that amylpred might be a useful tool to experimental researchers. however, it should perhaps be emphasized that the use of amylpred does not provide insights on the molecular rules underlying the aggregation event, as other tools, like tango  <cit> , actually do.

of course, it may be argued that most false positives, which result in the low correlation values presented in table  <dig>  are mainly due to consensual overpredictions, since all currently available amyloid prediction methods are notorious for their high degree of overprediction, and this perhaps is further seen in additional file  <dig>  where the results of amylpred are compared with those derived by a recently developed method aggrescan  <cit>  and also when compared against those of two other recently presented prediction algorithms pasta  <cit>  and zyggregator  <cit>  . however, it is obvious that further experiments are needed, which may reveal important clues for the amyloidogenic properties of the relevant proteins.

also, it should be said that questions may be raised about the statistics provided in table  <dig>  as well as the data set used to generate these statistics: ideally the data set should be composed of more or less equal amounts of experimentally verified positives and negatives, allowing to score both false negatives and false positives. as the experimentally verified set is only composed of positives, only false negatives can be scored.

nevertheless, in this study, we demonstrated rather conclusively that, practically all experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants, to date, and more than 70% of predicted, but not yet experimentally verified short potential amyloidogenic stretches, are placed on the surface of the amyloidogenic proteins . furthermore, several of them have the ability to act as conformational 'switches' . this may signify that aggregation and amyloid formation is mediated via such short stretches, which may be achieved by partial local unfolding. it is perhaps difficult to reconcile this observation with the hypothesis that protein unfolding should occur prior to aggregation, however, these short stretches may act as 'switches', for partial unfolding of the whole protein. experiments, focused on these fragments, should be performed to test this idea. in this respect, it interesting to note that, the peptide vealyl, which appears in the crystal structure of insulin  adopts an α-helical conformation, with leu buried into the hydrophobic interior of the insulin monomer , whereas, when crystallized alone, forms a steric zipper, class  <dig> , adopting an extended β-strand conformation. at the same time, amylpred predicts it as an amyloidogenic determinant , with its subordinate program secstr classifying it as a 'chameleon' sequence, that is, a sequence with ambivalent propensity both for α-helix and β-sheet. this observation may have important implications for the amyloidosis related to insulin, namely iatrogenic amyloidosis  <cit> , presumably by finding factors that may stabilize the conformation of this peptide as α-helical, in vivo. thinking along similar lines may lead to a number of interesting practical consequences for other amyloidoses related to proteins of known 3d-structure, with experimentally verified amyloidogenic determinants, accessible on the surface of the proteins .

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study clearly suggest that nearly all experimentally determined amyloidogenic determinants and a large percentage of predicted, but not yet experimentally verified short potential amyloidogenic stretches, are found on the surface of the relevant proteins, 'exposed' to the surrounding solvent and to interactions with neighbouring molecules. furthermore, several of them have the ability to act as conformational 'switches', for partial unfolding of the whole protein. experiments, focused on these fragments, should be performed to test this idea.
