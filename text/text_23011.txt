BACKGROUND
cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of death in taiwan and many countries, of which myocardial infarction  is the most serious condition. low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and triglyceride  levels in the blood are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. elevated concentrations of total cholesterol  and ldl in serum are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease  <cit> . hyperlipidemia is a significant cause of mi, because it is characterized by high serum tc, ldl, and tgs and because its complex mechanisms affect progressive atherosclerosis  <cit> .

in the past decade, genome-wide association studies  on hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction have examined gene expression and heredity in families and identified several candidate genes and snps. gwass have linked snps to susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases, such as familial combined hyperlipidemia   <cit>  and dyslipoproteinemia  <cit> . many gwass of cardiovascular disease have identified several loci; for example, the wtccc study reported nine loci that were robustly associated with coronary artery disease, including 9p3l and 9p <dig>  <cit> . these loci were also discovered in south korean  <cit>  and italian populations  <cit> . these results indicate that gene variation mediates fchl and hyperlipidemia.

of the sequence variations in the human genome, copy number variation  contributes directly to changes in gene expression through gene dosage effects. cnv is a variation in the dna sequence and can affect the expression of nearby and distal genes, causing phenotypic differences. stranger et al. analyzed the association of expression levels of  <dig>  transcripts with snps and cnvs, noting that signals from these types of variation have little overlap  <cit> . examining the genome for both variants might be an effective means of determining the causes of complex phenotypes and diseases in humans.

cnv regions have been estimated to cover 18% of the human genome  <cit> . inherited cnvs underlie mendelian diseases, and some copy number  variable genes are associated with human diseases, such as schizophrenia and autism  <cit> . lanktree and hegele suggest that rare and common cnvs contribute to the susceptibility to metabolic disease. a common cnv in lpa, encoding apolipoprotein, is the primary determinant of plasma lipoprotein concentrations and a risk factor for atherosclerosis, and cnvs in ldlr mediate heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in patients  <cit> . cnvs are a significant source of genetic diversity, but their influence on phenotypic variability, including disease susceptibility, remains poorly understood. their findings have encouraged further investigation of the relationship between cnvs and cardiovascular disease.

with regard to cardiovascular disease, several articles on copy number variation in hyperlipidemia patients or copy number variation in myocardial infarction patients have been reported, but there is no cnv research integrating both diseases. in this study, we try to discover novel suspect cnv region from myocardial infarction patients with hyperlipidemia. study of disease specific cnv region of myocardial infarction patients with hyperlipidemia might help to find out the disease mechanism and might aid in disease prediction.

verification of cnv region by real-time pcr
discussion
cnvs have been implicated in few mendelian diseases on the molecular level. it would be premature to predict the relative proportion of complex diseases that are attributed to snps and cnvs due to the limited knowledge on the genetic basis of common, complex phenotypes  <cit> . in this study, hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction-specific cnv regions were identified by cnv analysis on a snp array, and some of which lay in regions that have been linked to hyperlipidemia and myocardial infarction in gwass . yip et al. have linked atherogenic dyslipidemia and chromosome 1q <dig>  <cit> ; shmulewitz et al.  <cit>  also observed that 1p <dig> and other regions are associated with significant heritability of metabolic traits. these regions coincide with our findings, and our cnv analysis narrows the range of functional gene regions.

in the present study, we have two interesting observations to bring out the possibility of relationship between the specific cnv region and hyperlipidemia in relative small p-value. the first observation is that the gain cnv region lies within the coding region of p <dig> of ret , and it is a member of the cadherin superfamily and encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase . chia implicated adhesion molecules in atherogenesis in a report on the relationship between cell surface proteins and hyperlipidemia and focusing on interactions between the endothelium, monocytes, and leukocytes and the influence of cytokines, oxidized low-density lipoproteins, and genetic determinants  <cit> . the second observation is that the gain cnv region on 16q <dig>   lay in cdh <dig>  dong et al. noted the significant linkage between tc level and specific expression on 16q <dig>  in a genome-wide linkage scan of  <dig> subjects from  <dig> dominican families for  <dig> quantitative lipid traits, which identified several nearby genes, including cdh <dig> <cit> . the gene function of ret and cdh <dig> is similar and belong to cell-surface protein, and several literatures bring out the function of these two genes may influence the level of low-density lipoproteins.

to further support our result, we have checked the haplotype data from our patient cohort. first, there are four haplotypes in represented cnv region of ret by query hapmap  and these four snps are not listed in the patient’s haplotype data. these four snps are located in the same block. second, there is only a snp rs <dig> in represented cnv region of cdh <dig> by query hapmap, and this snp is also not listed in the patient’s haplotype data. although there is no direct evidence indicating a relation between hyperlipidemia and these two cnv regions, these regions were still valuable to investigate the role of regulation in related gene.

comparative genomic hybridization  and single-nucleotide polymorphism  arrays are high-resolution tools that can be used to detect subtle cn alterations on the genomic scale. snp arrays cost less and are easier to use than cgh in detecting one snp and it can detect all snps in the entire genome, allele frequencies, and copy numbers in a single reaction. hmm segmentation and genomic segmentation are the principal algorithms in cnv detection and help us to discover the cnv in patients; however, multi-base and multi allele snps cannot be detected by snp arrays and increase false negative and false positive. additional experiment platforms such as fluorescence in situ hybridization , cgh array or real-time pcr will be needed to obtain more reliable results  <cit> . fortunately, the real-time pcr result of observed cnv in 10q <dig>  is same to microarray and in preliminary confirms our result.

as the sample size is small , we use the two-tailed fisher's exact test and only consider events with high significance . besides, these  <dig> patients are independent individuals; none of any two patients come from the same family. however, our findings may needs to be viewed with caution and be verified to step forward.

cnvs vary slightly in location and frequency between populations. the distribution of cnvs differs, based on genetic background, and population-specific cnvs can result in the divergence of physiological characteristics and disease prevalence between races  <cit> . previous cnv discoveries were mostly limited to the sample from hapmap and to samples from caucasian individuals, and other cnv survey studies using different ethnic backgrounds were needed. therefore, all subjects in our study were taiwanese and only han chinese and japanese population data in hapmap project were considered for the help of cnv analysis.

metabolic disorders were considered as correlated with multiple gene variation  <cit> . in this study, we discovered several cnv regions in patients and propose that might regulate gene expression and subsequent synthesis of specific proteins in hyperlipidemia, and we will make every effort to discover stronger evidences in the relationship between hyperlipidemia and specific cnvs in future.

CONCLUSIONS
cnv is an important mechanism of hyperlipidaemia, and performing cnv analysis in hyperlipidemia and mi patients through bioinformatics methods is helpful in identifying disease-specific variants of genes. in this study, seven cnv regions that associated with hyperlipidemia and mi were discovered and real-time pcr was performed to confirm the result. after verified the independent of cnv and haplotype in patient cohort, these susceptibility cnvs reported in this study might associate with myocardial infarction patients with hyperlipidemia and might have the potential to be biomarkers.
