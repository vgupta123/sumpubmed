BACKGROUND
medial septal/diagonal band complex  is a highly heterogeneous region with different types of neurons and implicated in various functions such as arousal, sensory processing, motivation, emotion, learning and memory  <cit> . ms/dbb contains cholinergic, gabaergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons  <cit> , nitric oxide synthase positive neurons, and a number of peptidergic neurons  <cit>  that co-localize with gabaergic or cholinergic neurons  <cit> . cholinergic neurons have received particular attention not only for their roles in learning and memory, but also for their involvement in the pathology of alzheimer's disease   <cit> .

there are four classes of neurons in the ms/dbb distinguished by electrophysiological characteristics  <cit> . the first group includes slow-firing neurons with broad action potential  and long duration afterhyperpolarization . the second group consists of fast-firing neurons with narrower action potential and shorter ahp. the third group comprises burst-firing neurons whose membrane properties are similar to those of fast-firing neurons, but can fire in bursts when depolarized from a hyperpolarized holding potential . a recent study confirmed that the slow-firing neurons are cholinergic, and both of the fast-firing and the burst-firing neurons are gabaergic neurons. the fourth class of neurons is cluster-firing neurons and is glutamatergic. these neurons have electrophysiological properties similar to those of slow-firing neurons. however, prolonged  depolarization revealed that these neurons exhibited a cluster-firing pattern  <cit> . huh, et al.  <cit>  revealed that the glutamatergic neurons in ms/dbb display a highly heterogeneous set of firing patterns including fast-, cluster-, burst-, and slow-firing, therefore, electrophysiologic properties of the glutamatergic neurons in ms/dbb should be further studied.

nestin is an intermediate filament protein expressed transiently by neural progenitor cells and reactivated glial cells  <cit>  and is involved in cell survival and reparation  <cit> . recently, researchers identified a group of nestin immunoreactive  cells in the ms/dbb of adult rats and humans  <cit> . the expression of neuron specific enolase  and neuron-specific nuclear protein , but not glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggests that the nestin-ir cells are functional neurons. they are also similar to cholinergic neurons in distribution and morphology and are intermingled with other types of neurons. double labelling immunohistochemistry showed that there was no overlap between nestin-ir and parvalbumin immunoreactive  neurons in the ms/dbb, and about 35% of nestin-ir neurons were choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive  neurons  <cit> . further study showed that progressive degeneration of nestin-ir neurons might be involved in the mechanisms of aging and memory deficit  <cit> . although a few basic morphological studies have been made on nestin-ir neurons, the neurochemical properties of nestin-ir neurons and the significance of nestin expression in functional neurons remain unclear. the purpose of the present study is to explore the neurochemical properties of nestin-expressing  neurons with single-cell rt-cpr , to investigate the intrinsic membrane properties and excitatory synaptic afferent currents of nestin+ neurons using whole-cell patch clamp recording, and to explore the neuronal circuit of nestin+ neurons with retrograde labelling combined with nestin and chat immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS
chemical phenotypes of ms/dbb neurons identified by sc-rt-pcr
a total of  <dig> medial septal/diagonal band complex  neurons were electrophysiologically recorded and their chemical phenotypes were identified by multiplex sc-rt-pcr. the results showed that the mrnas encoding nestin, chat, glutamic acid decarboxylases  <dig> , vesicular glutamate transporters  <dig> or  <dig>  could be reversely transcribed and amplified from the harvested cytoplasm. automatic sequencing confirmed that each pcr product is from the target cdna. the ms/dbb neurons studied in our experiment were comprised of  <dig> chat mrna-positive neurons  that are cholinergic neurons,  <dig> gad <dig> mrna-positive neurons  that are gabaergic neurons. there were  <dig> neurons co-expressing chat mrna and gad <dig> mrna, of which,  <dig> were categorized as cholinergic neuron and  <dig> as gabaergic neuron according to their electrophysiological properties. nine neurons solely expressed vglut <dig> mrna or/and vglut <dig> mrnas but not chat mrna or gad <dig> mrnas, which confirms the identification of glutamatergic neurons  <cit> . among the  <dig> nestin mrna-positive  neurons,  <dig> %  neurons expressed chat mrna. conversely,  <dig> %  of chat+ neurons expressed nestin mrna. however, no nestin mrna was found co-expressing gad <dig> mrna or vglut mrna. the neurons did not express any of these mrna were discarded.

the intrinsic membrane properties of nestin mrna+ neurons
eighty-seven neurons were assessed for their electrophysiological profile. this assessment identified  <dig> slow-firing neurons,  <dig> cluster-firing neurons and  <dig> fast-firing neurons. although some neurons presented rebound action potentials following a hyperpolarization current injection, we did not find any typical burst-firing neuron in our experiment. all of the recorded nestin+ cells were excitable, with typical electrophysiological characteristics of functional neurons. in voltage-clamp mode, when depolarized from - <dig> mv, typical neuronal whole-cell currents  could be elicited . in current-clamp mode, typical neural action potential was observed in response to a short period of depolarization, and repetitive action potentials could be elicited when sustained positive current was applied . as most of nestin mrna co-expressed with chat mrna, we first compared electrophysiological properties of nestin+ neurons  to nestin mrna-negative & chat mrna-positive  neurons, and with gad67+ neurons and vglut+ neurons . then, we compared electrophysiological properties of nestin mrna-positive & chat mrna-negative  neurons, nestin mrna-positive and chat mrna-positive  neurons, and nestin mrna-negative & chat mrna-positive neurons  so as to identify the electrophysiological characteristics among different categories of nestin and chat expressing patterns .

nestin+, nestin mrna-positive neuron ; nestin- & chat+, nestin mrna-negative and choline acetyl transferase mrna-positive neuron; gad67+, glutamic acid decarboxylases  <dig> mrna-positive neuron; vglut+, vesicular glutamate transporter  <dig> or/and  <dig> mrna-positive neuron. cm, membrane capacitance; rm, membrane resistance; tau, time constant; rmp, resting membrane potential; threshold, action potential threshold; ahp, afterhyperpolarization; mf, mean firing rate; fmax, maximal firing frequency; fsteady, steady firing frequency. ih, hyperpolarization activated current of neurons when hyperpolarized from - <dig> to - <dig> mv. the current pulses used for membrane property analyses were  <dig> - <dig>  na. all values are presented as means ± s.m.e. significant differences are identified: a versus gad67+ neurons, p <  <dig> ; b versus gad67+ neurons, p <  <dig> ; c versus nestin+ neurons, p <  <dig> .

nestin+ neurons  had a mean fire rate  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz, maximal firing frequency  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz, and steady firing frequency  of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hz. these neurons also had broad action potentials  and large afterhyperpolarization , which were similar to nestin- & chat+ neurons . these data suggest that nestin+ neurons share many basic characteristics with nestin- & chat+ neurons in the ms/dbb. the spike width, ahp amplitude and duration of nestin+ neurons were significantly larger than that of gad67+ neurons . however, mf, depolarizing sag, and hyperpolarization activated current of neurons  were smaller than those of gad67+ neurons . furthermore, other key properties of nestin+ neurons were significantly different from those of gad67+ neurons . thus, the nestin+ neurons were distinctive from the classic gabaergic neurons. nestin+ neurons shared some membrane properties of vglut+ neurons, but had larger ih and no cluster firing in response to prolonged depolarization from - <dig> mv. in summary, the ih of nestin+ neurons were smaller than those of the gad67+ neurons, but greater than the ih of the vglut+ . statistical analysis showed the different ih and other parameters among the subpopulations of neurons in ms/dbb .

interestingly, while further analyzed the electrophysiological properties of nestin+ & chat-, nestin+ & chat+ and nestin+ & chat- neurons, we found that the ih of nestin+ & chat+ neurons were larger than those of nestin- & chat+ neurons , and nestin+ & chat- neurons had a rmp of - <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, which were significantly lower than that of nestin- & chat+ neurons  . however, other electrophysiological differences  among these neurons were not found.

excitatory postsynaptic currents recorded from nestin+ & chat+ neurons and nestin- & chat+ neurons
in this section, nineteen neurons, which contained  <dig> nestin- & chat+ neurons and  <dig> nestin+ & chat+ neurons, were recorded, and  <dig> sepscs events and  <dig> mepscs events were analyzed in total. the addition of  <dig> μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline- <dig>  3-dione  abolished all synaptic events, indicating the involvement of non-nmda glutamate receptors .

the sepscs amplitude  of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was significantly larger than that of the nestin- & chat+ neurons  . the sepscs amplitudes cumulative probability distribution curve of nestin+ & chat+ neurons showed a right shift compared to the curve for nestin- & chat+ neurons . this result suggests that the sepscs distribution patterns of nestin+ & chat+ neurons were different from those of nestin- & chat+ neurons. it also provided further evidence to confirm that the sepscs amplitude of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was significantly larger than those of the nestin- & chat+ neurons. both the student's t-test and the kolmogorov-smirnov test  were used to determine if the two datasets differ significantly. as student's t-test is a parametric test and may be more sensitive if the data meets the requirements of the student's t-test. the ks-test, on the other hand, has the advantage of making no assumptions about the distribution of data . therefore, in order to compare the mean value and distribution of the sepscs and mepscs, we used both, finding that the ks-test is more suited than the student's t-test. the sepscs inter-event intervals cumulative probability distribution curve of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was on the left of the curve for nestin- & chat+ neurons , which indicates the sepscs frequency of the nestin+ & chat+ neurons was higher than that of the nestin- & chat+ neurons   <cit> .

in order to further explore the mechanism of the different sepscs between the nestin- & chat+ and nestin+ & chat+ neurons, mepscs of both kinds of neurons were studied. the independent samples student's t-test showed that the mepscs amplitude  of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was significantly larger than that of nestin- & chat+ neurons  . the mepscs amplitudes cumulative probability distribution curve of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was on the right of that for the nestin- & chat+ neurons . the mepscs inter-event intervals cumulative probability distribution curve of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was on the right for that of nestin- & chat+ neurons . these results confirmed that nestin+ & chat+ neurons had higher mepscs amplitude than nestin- & chat+ neurons and that the mepscs frequency of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was lower than that of the nestin- & chat+ neurons .

the paired samples student's t-test results showed that the mepscs frequency was significantly lower than sepscs frequency in nestin+ & chat+ , but no difference was found between the mepscs and sepscs frequencies of nestin- & chat+ neurons . the sepscs/mepscs frequency ratio of nestin+ & chat+ neurons was approximately two times higher than that nestin- & chat+ neurons. however, there was no difference between the amplitudes of mepscs and sepscs of nestin- & chat+ neurons or nestin+ & chat+ neurons . these results suggest that the higher sepscs amplitude of nestin+ & chat+ neurons compared to the nestin- & chat+ neurons was not changed by  <dig> μm ttx, implied it might come from the higher excitability of nestin+ & chat+ neurons themselves rather than from stronger excitatory action potentials of presynaptic neurons. furthermore, there was no difference between synaptic multiplicities of nestin+ & chat+ neurons and nestin- & chat+ neurons, which suggests that the nestin+ & chat+ neurons and nestin- & chat+ neurons shared similar maturity . in summary, these results provide powerful evidence that despite shared similar maturity, nestin+ & chat+ neurons receive stronger excitatory synaptic inputs and have higher excitability compared to nestin- & chat+ neurons.

immunofluorescence study of the biocytin-filled neurons
twenty-eight neurons were successfully filled with biocytin and visualized by rhodamine red-x. cell bodies were particularly well-labelled, allowing us to determine their position relative to the ms/dbb. biocytin-filled neurons were bipolar or multipolar and gave off two or three primary dendrites that subsequently bifurcated to the adjacent areas. the axons originated from the soma or proximal end of a primary dendrite. no evidence of axon collaterals was found in our slices. of the  <dig> biocytin-filled neurons,  <dig> were chat-immunoreactive  neurons, among which  <dig> %  were nestin-immunoreactive  neurons. eleven out of the  <dig> biocytin-filled neurons were nestin-ir neurons,  <dig> %  of which were also chat-immunoreactive .

retrograde tracing of fast blue from the ca <dig> area of hippocampus
examination of serial section of the basal forebrain region  <dig> days after injection of the fast blue revealed that the blue colour fluorescence could be visualized clearly. the fast blue labelled somas were seen throughout the entire ms/dbb region. histological examination of the ms/dbb area after labelling revealed striking intense signals in the cell body, however, the neuritis were difficult to distinguish from background. in order to define the anatomical circuits of the nestin+ and nestin- cholinergic projection to the hippocampus, we evaluated the percentage of chat and nestin immunoreactivity among the fast blue-labelled neurons in the ms/dbb region after fast blue intra-hippocampus instillation. the nestin and chat immunoreactive cells were clearly labelled by green and red colour fluorescence specifically. in order to find the ratio of the nestin+ or nestin- cholinergic neurons projection to the hippocampus, the double or triple fluorescence of combined immunohistochemistry and retrograde labelling were carefully measured. approximately  <dig> % of the fast blue-labelled neurons in the ms/dbb area were chat-immunoreactive. in which,  <dig> % were nestin-expressing neurons, and  <dig> % nestin non-expressing cholinergic neurons .

discussion
the main findings of this study were as follows: the electrophysiologically recorded cells expressing nestin mrna in the ms/dbb are functional neurons; the majority of nestin+ neurons are cholinergic neurons rather than gabaergic or glutamatergic neurons; nestin+ & chat+ neurons are more excitable and received stronger excitatory synaptic afferent currents than those of the nestin- & chat+ neurons. in addition, the fast blue retrograde labelling experiment demonstrates that both the nestin+ and nestin- cholinergic neurons sent projections to hippocampus.

the recorded cells expressing nestin in ms/dbb are functional neurons
using whole-cell recording combined with sc-rt-pcr, our experiment demonstrated that all of the electrophysiologically recorded cells expressing nestin mrna in ms/dbb were excitable. whole cell currents of functional neurons could be elicited from these neurons in voltage-clamp mode; typical neural action potential was observed in response to a short period of depolarization, and repetitive action potentials could be elicited when sustained positive current was applied in current-clamp mode. due to their typical intrinsic membrane properties recorded here, we concluded that these cells are functional neurons rather than stem cells or glial cells, since neural stem cells and glial cells could not be excited to produce neural action potential. for the first time, these data confirmed that nestin+ cells in the ms/dbb are functional neurons by the joint evidence of mrna expression and electrophysiological properties from whole-cell recordings.

most of the nestin+ neurons in ms/dbb were cholinergic neurons
sc-rt-pcr results revealed  <dig> % of nestin+ neurons expressed chat mrna, and about  <dig> % of chat+ neurons expressed nestin mrna. however, no nestin+ neurons expressed gad <dig> mrna or vglut mrna. these results were further confirmed by the nestin and chat immunofluorescent labelling of biocytin filled neurons and fast blue retrograded labelled neurons under the laser confocal microscope, which confirmed that nearly one half of the chat-ir neurons were nestin-ir neurons. there were a few nestin+ neurons that did not express chat+, gad <dig> or vglut mrna. this may stem from limit of methodology, or there were a new class of neurons in ms/dbb.

taken together, these observations provide new evidence that the majority of nestin+ neurons in ms/dbb were cholinergic neurons rather than gabaergic or glutamatergic neurons. in other words, cholinergic neurons in the ms/dbb could be subdivided into nestin-expressing cholinergic neurons  and nestin non-expressing cholinergic neurons . this result is partially inconsistent with the previous reports, in which about 35% of nestin-ir neurons were chat-ir  <cit> . the possible reason of the difference may stem from the sensitivity of the methodology. previous studies used double-staining immunohistochemistry, which visualized same neuron with 3'-diaminobenzidine  and  <dig>  3', 5', 5-tetramethylbenzidine-sodium tungstate . the two chromogenic reagents may interfere with each other and lead to false-negative results. in addition, tmb colour faded rapidly. consequently, in the use of this labelling method some neurons were stained with ambiguous colour and it was, therefore, difficult to accurately assess their phenotype. the other possible reason may be that sc-rt-pcr detects mrna but immunohistochemistry detects proteins, and that not all mrna may be translated into proteins.

nechs and nnchs had different electrophysiological properties
the ih current serves as a pacemaker, and is implicated in generating rhythmic bursts in a number of brain structures such as thalamus, hippocampus and cortex  <cit> . previous work revealed that cholinergic neuron displayed slow-firing and little or no ih; gabaergic neuron was fast-firing neuron, had a substantial ih; and glutamatergic displayed electrophysiological properties similar to cholinergic neurons such as the occurrence of a very small ih  <cit> . in our study, we found gabaergic neurons had prominent ih, whereas cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons had small or no ih, which was consistent with previous studies.

the ih and sepscs amplitude of nechs were larger than those of nnchs, which implies that nechs are more excitable than nnchs and may have different roles in learning and memory. the higher sepscs frequency and amplitude of the nechs suggests that the nechs received stronger spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than those of the nnchs. the mepscs amplitude of nechs were significantly larger than those of nnchs, but no differences were observed between the amplitudes of mepscs and sepscs on nechs or nnchs, suggesting that presynaptic spontaneous action potential did not affect the sepscs amplitude of both the nechs and nnchs. these data also suggest that the higher sepscs amplitude of nechs was due to more excitatory receptors or higher sensitivity of the receptors compared to the nnchs. the similar multiplicities of nechs and nnchs suggested that both kinds of neurons share same level of maturity. interestingly, the mepscs frequency of nechs, but not nnchs, was remarkably lower than sepscs frequency, which led to the large shift in the frequency of spontaneous activity, indicating that a great number of spontaneous events of nechs recorded in absence of ttx could be attributed to the neurotransmitter released by action potential dependent mechanisms. therefore, the stronger spontaneous excitatory afferent current could be attributed to the higher synaptic transmission efficacy to the nechs, and higher excitability of the nechs compared to the nnchs.

nechs and nnchs project parallelly to hippocampus
ms/dbb is one of the most important inputs to the hippocampal neurons  <cit> . the hippocampus receives its cholinergic projections predominantly from ms, and to a lesser extent, from the vdb . this cholinergic input is of particular importance for learning and memory processes .

in our experiment, we have demonstrated that nestin+ neurons are a subtype of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons using single-cell rt-pcr, immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological property analysis. therefore, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons could be divided into two groups according to whether expressing nestin and their electrophysiological properties. retrograde labelling combined with chat and nestin immunofluorescence suggested that both of the nestin+ and the nestin- cholinergic neurons project to the hippocampus. therefore, we concluded that there are two parallel septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathways. one pathway originates from ms/dbb nestin-expressing cholinergic neurons , and the other pathway originates from nestin non-expressing cholinergic neurons . because the nechs and nnchs had different intrinsic electrophysiological properties and received distinct excitatory synaptic inputs, they may have different functions in maintaining the electrical activities in the hippocampus, which is worthy of further study.

nestin is expressed transiently by neural progenitor cells and reactivated glial cells  <cit>  and is involved in cell survival and reparation  <cit> . previous studies revealed that purkinje cells in cerebella of creutzfeldt-jakob disease and dorsal root ganglia neurons following nerve injury express nestin, and that nestin expression might represent a stage of protective reaction to prolong the survival of neurons or enhance the differentiation of neurons in order to compensate for lost neurons  <cit> . in addition, intracerebroventricular injection of colchicine can lead to irreversible reduction of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons  <cit> , but only cause transient reduction of basal forebrain nestin-ir neurons  <cit> . as most of the nestin mrna+ neurons were cholinergic neurons, it is implied that nestin expression might mark a special stage of cholinergic neurons that were relatively spared from severe degeneration and cell death. it is also possible that nestin expression marks a type of newly differentiated neurons that compensate for lost ms/dbb cholinergic neurons. the mechanism underlying the protective plasticity and viability of nechs and nnchs are worthy of further study using selectively or non-selectively ms/dbb neurons damaging model  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we studied the electrophysiological properties of the novel nestin+ neurons in the ms/dbb, and demonstrated that most of nestin+ neurons are functional cholinergic neurons. we also provided evidence that the nechs had higher excitability and received stronger spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs than those of the nnchs. then we demonstrated that both of the nechs and nnchs projected to the hippocampus. the different electrophysiological properties of nechs and nnchs and common neural circuits to hippocampus suggested that there are two parallel septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathways that may have different functions. whether nestin expression affects the cholinergic neurons' properties require further study by manipulation of gene expression. these results will not only facilitate our understanding of the structures and biological function of basal forebrain, the mechanism of learning and memory, the ageing process and the pathology of ad, but may also provide a new insight for ad treatment.
