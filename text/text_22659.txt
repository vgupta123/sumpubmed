BACKGROUND
staphylococci are gram-positive facultative anaerobes comprising  <dig> species commonly found in soil or on the skin of animals  <cit> . s. aureus is the most pathogenic of the genus and is commonly associated with septicemia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and skin infection  <cit> . isolates of s. aureus are generally susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, but extensive use of this class of drugs has led to the emergence of resistant strains  <cit> . in  <dig> the centers for disease control and prevention  reported  <dig>  methicillin-resistant s. aureus  infections in the u.s. leading to  <dig>  deaths. while improved infection control policies decreased clinical mrsa infections by 52 % between  <dig> and  <dig>  there remains a need to rapidly screen patients for s. aureus and determine antibiotic resistance.

culture-, biochemical-, and molecular-based methods are the current standard for clinical mrsa detection. culture methods offer high specificity, but relatively lengthy turnaround times  of 24–72 h and the requirement for secondary resistance testing contribute significantly to delays in onset of treatment. a retrospective cohort study of bloodstream infections found that mortality rates rose  <dig>  % per hour for every hour of delay in the initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy  <cit> . chromogenic agars have been used to slightly decrease tat to 18–24 h, while also improving specificity, but secondary resistance testing is still required  <cit> .

some of the most common approaches for analysis of the specific biochemical characteristics of staphylococci include: coagulase and phosphatase activity, hemolysis, nitrate reduction, and aerobic acid production from carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . kloos and coworkers reported a simplified scheme for analyzing the extensive data produced by biochemical results to characterize staphylococci. the commercially available biomérieux api staph-ident and american hospital supply corporation microscan systems are based on this approach. the api staph-ident utilizes a battery of  <dig> microscale biochemical tests, whereas the microscan system consists of  <dig> tests  <cit> . these systems were reported to have accuracies of  <dig> and  <dig>  %, respectively, but also showed inherent limitations .

in order to improve the specificity and selectivity of staphylococcus detection, molecular methods for analyzing specific genetic markers have been explored. in an attempt to identify s. aureus and assay for methicillin resistance, multiplexed pcr has been used to simultaneously target the staphylococcal nuc gene, encoding a thermostable nuclease , and the meca gene, encoding a penicillin binding protein  <cit> . pcr results agreed with coagulase production and agar screening tests for single-step identification of mrsa. in an attempt to identify coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains , one study targeted a 429-bp amplicon of the soda gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase  <cit> . clinical isolates and atcc reference strains were identified with 83 % accuracy in about 8 h. while culturing and biochemical assays offer comparable specificity to results obtained by hsp <dig>  <cit>  and 16s rrna sequencing  <cit> ; tat is still typically greater than 24 h.

turnaround time was significantly reduced using phage amplification-based lateral flow immunochromatography   <cit> . this work led to the fda-approved microphage keypath mrsa/mssa blood culture test  <cit> . exploitation of s. aureus-specific phage amplification targeting clinical blood isolates allowed for simultaneous identification and methicillin resistance determination with a tat of 5 h and  <dig>  % accuracy  <cit> .

published reports suggest the rise of non-s. aureus infections in clinical studies, some with resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics . cons are among the most commonly reported bloodstream isolates   <cit> . these reports place emphasis on the importance of s. epidermidis, s. saprophyticus, s. lugdunensis, and s. schleiferi infection and further demonstrate the need for more rapid techniques for simultaneous species-level staphylococcus identification and antibiotic resistance determination. bacterial protein-profiling by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry  has been used to identify s. aureus and cons in prosthetic joint infections  <cit> . although this method was relatively rapid, only 52 % highly probable species-level identification was obtained.

a report by dubois and coworkers using the bruker biotyper maldi-tof ms protein analysis of  <dig> staphylococcal isolates correctly identify  <dig> samples at the species level. these results confirmed their earlier findings using a pcr-based soda gene array  <cit> . rajakurna et al. correctly identified a different set of staphylococcus isolates with 97 % accuracy using the microbelynx macromolecule profiling database, developed by waters corporation  <cit> .

a maldi mass spectral-bacterial profiling approach using fatty acids as diagnostic biomarkers rather than proteins was recently reported . employing maldi with ceo <dig>  as an in situ saponification catalyst and matrix replacement, bacterial samples were identified to the species level with 97 % accuracy  <cit> . in a follow up study, suites of enterobacteriaceae, listeria, and acinetobacter were analyzed in parallel by moli ms fatty acid profiling and the bruker biotyper protein profiling  <cit> . the results from this study clearly established fatty acid moli ms profiling for strain-level differentiation of closely-related phylotypes with 98–100 % accuracy. in comparison, protein profiling of the same samples correctly identified enterobacteriaceae with 30 %, listeria with 64 % and acinetobacter with 66 % accuracy at the species level.

the present study describes moli ms ceo <dig> fatty acid profiling of  <dig> non-aureus staphylococcus strains and 19 s. aureus strains . a fuzzy rule building expert system   <cit>  and a self-optimizing partial least squares discriminant analysis   <cit>  were used for classification.

RESULTS
spectral analysis
moli ms was used to analyze  <dig> staphylococcus extracts listed in table 1a to develop fa profiles. for the  <dig> staphylococcus species, the spectra  contained similar fatty acids. c15: <dig> was common to all spectra as the base peak, while the other fas, listed in table  <dig>  ranged from  <dig> to 30 % relative abundance. the intensities of fa peak distribution allowed the spectra to be visually divided into three distinct categories: group 1: s. aureus, s. auricularis, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, and s. shleiferi, which were all observed to have similar respective c16: <dig>  c17: <dig> and c18: <dig> ratios; group 2: s. harmolyticus, s. haemolyticus, s. hyicus, and s. saprophyticus, which displayed the highest prevalence of unsaturation consisting of 10-38 % unsaturated fas; and group 3: s. lugdunensis, s. lentus, s. simulans, and s. warneri, which each exhibited a unique defining characteristic absent from the other two groups. figure  <dig> shows two representative spectra for each of the three groups. as visual examples, slight differences in the relative abundance of minor fas for group  <dig> enhanced differentiation. figure 1a illustrates differentiation of s. aureus and s. auricularis by the appearance of c17: <dig> and c20: <dig> in the latter. as shown in fig. 1b, minor fas were crucial in separating group  <dig> organisms. for example, s. haemolyticus was differentiated from s. saprophyticus by the absence of c20: <dig> as well as a decrease in c18: <dig> and increase in c18: <dig> in the latter. figure 1c illustrates the differentiation of group  <dig> organisms. s. lugdunensis, was distinguished from s. lentus by c14: <dig>  which was the second most abundant fa with respect to c15: <dig>  encompassing 20 % of the relative abundance, as well as by the appearance of c21: <dig> in s. lentus. visual analysis of the respective ratios of fas provided a qualitative basis for bivariate analysis, but multivariate statistics were needed to process complex data sets.fig.  <dig> representative fatty acid profiles. fatty acids are labeled with respect to chain length and degree of unsaturation.  group  <dig>   group  <dig>   group 3



species-level differentiation
principal component analysis  was employed to classify staphylococcus at the species-level. a score plot of the first three components, which encompassed  <dig>  % of total variance, is shown in fig.  <dig>  colored points represent individual replicates of each bacterial species. the degree of separation was indicated by the distinct clustering of members of the same species  and the distance between different species . all species clearly plotted in unique space, which was supported by the 100 % classification rate obtained by losocv. figure  <dig> shows a dendrogram based on euclidean distances between spectra, which demonstrated classification of the profiles into well-defined clusters.fig.  <dig> species-level pca differentiation of  <dig> staphylococcus isolates

fures analysis  defined  <dig> rules indicating perfect classification  <cit> . average prediction results for  <dig> bootstraps were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for fures and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for pls-da. bootstrap latin partition validation randomly divided the data into training and test sets such that the training set contained twice the number of data points when compared to the test set. in addition, validation maintained the same class distributions between training and test sets so that training and test sets would have the same proportion of objects  from each class . three hundred models were built and evaluated for bootstrap analysis. because each profile was only used once per bootstrap, the results of three latin partitions were pooled and were comprehensive for all fa profiles. the results from  <dig> bootstraps were averaged and reported with 95 % confidence intervals. fures and pls-da, which are much more rigorous than losocv, are a weaker measure with respect to a model’s dependence on training set composition and the accuracy of the data within the prediction set. fures consistently outperformed pls-da, because it is a nonlinear classifier ideally suited for predicting classes that are binary encoded. pls-da, which is designed for calibration of continuous variables, may construct ill-conditioned models  when trying to fit the binary encoded target matrix. this problem often occurs with complex data sets  <cit> .fig.  <dig> fures species-level staphylococcus classification tree. thirteen rules indicate perfect classification



strain-level differentiation
the versatility of moli ms for strain-level identification was further explored by analyzing extracts of  <dig> additional strains . fig.  <dig> shows a score plot of the first two pcs for this data; a total variance of  <dig>  % was defined by the first two pcs. the strains are denoted numerically with each species being represented by a different color. leave-one-spectrum-out cross-validation of the first ten pc scores correctly identified 100 %  of the samples at the species level and strain level, showing that all strains plotted independently. species-level groupings were also seen in the dendrogram in fig.  <dig>  where each main branch point corresponded to its own individual species.fig.  <dig> strain-level pca differentiation of  <dig> staphylococcus isolates

fures and pls-da calculations correctly classified the data into  <dig> strains. these results were obtained with  <dig> bootstraps and three latin partitions. fures and pls-da had  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % prediction rates, respectively. from the pca scores, it was shown that strains of the same species exhibit profiles that were highly similar.

mrsa/mssa differentiation
maldi protein profiling methods have shown a series of characteristic peaks for identification of s. aureus  <cit> . from direct comparison of reference strains, discrimination between mssa and mrsa was achieved, but a uniform signature profile could not be identified to allow for unknown classification  <cit> . to assess the utility of moli ms fa profiling for antibiotic resistance profiling, 18 s. aureus strains , listed in table 1c were analyzed. a score plot of the first two components defining 97 % of the total variance is shown in fig.  <dig>  in this projection, all strains were separated into unique groups according to methicillin resistance/susceptibility. strain-level classification correctly identified 90/ <dig> total replicates leading to 100 % accuracy using losocv.fig.  <dig> pca differentiation of mrsa and mssa. mrsa strains are designated by black and mssa strains are blue



the above data set yielded a fures tree with a single rule  indicating perfect separation of the two bacterial classes. because each of the mrsa and mssa groups comprised five replicates each of nine different strains, bootstrap latin partitioning grouped all samples such that no profiles from any given strain were contained in both the training and prediction sets at the same time. the prediction rates for strain-level identification of s. aureus were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for fures and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for pls-da. fures discriminant weights, based on a 95 % confidence interval, for mrsa and mssa classification revealed that odd-numbered fatty acids  were more prevalent in mssa isolates, while even-numbered fatty acids  were more prevalent in mrsa isolates . if the confidence interval intersected the origin in the positive or negative direction, that weight was significant. these results were in agreement with other reports in the literature that showed differences in fa composition between daptomycin-resistant enterococcus strains  <cit> .fig.  <dig> average of  <dig> fures discriminant weights with 95 % confidence intervals. if the confidence interval intersects the origin that weight is significant, with negative weights corresponding to larger features in mrsa and positive weights to larger features in mssa



CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated the utility of ceo2-moli ms fa profiling coupled with multivariate statistical analysis for performing strain-level differentiation of various staphylococcus species. the emergence of mrsa and cons clinical isolates and the need for rapid clinical intervention has made it increasingly important to differentiate staphylococcus isolates at the species and strain level. losocvs yielded 100 % correct classification at the species and strain level. fures classification, with a more rigorous evaluation, also consistently achieved 94 % accuracy. preliminary analysis differentiating mrsa from mssa demonstrated the feasibility of simultaneously determining strain identification and antibiotic resistance, which is increasingly important for therapeutic management and infection control. by eliminating the need for secondary testing, this could decrease the delay of drug administration by up to 54 h over conventional diagnostic techniques. ultimately, as is also the case in protein profiling, construction of a comprehensive database will be necessary for identification of unknown isolates.
