BACKGROUND
the majority of deaf children have hearing parents, whose primary language is a spoken language. children born severely or profoundly deaf do not have access to a spoken language and, thus, do not acquire a language from birth. in germany, these children usually acquire dgs from school mates after entering primary school or even later  <cit> . deaf children who lack input from a language model in the family usually generate a gestural communication system called ‘homesign’. such a system, however, is not a fully realized natural language and hence does not support language development  <cit> . by contrast, language development in deaf children of deaf parents whose primary language is a sign language develops similarly to hearing children of hearing parents  <cit> . from a linguistic point of view, sign languages are complete, natural, and fully realized languages with a phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics  <cit> . furthermore, studies on l <dig> processing have shown that neural correlates of oral language processing in native speakers and sign language processing in deaf signers are largely overlapping  <cit> .

in our erp study, we investigated the effects of a delayed l <dig> acquisition in a violation paradigm. semantic violations are known to be associated with a negative erp, the so called ‘n <dig> effect’ that has mostly been observed over centro-parietal electrode sites, particularly for written languages  <cit> . the n <dig> is considered to reflect lexical semantic integration processes  <cit> . additionally, semantic violations within the arguments of the verb sometimes elicit a positive erp as well, which has been related to the recruitment of additional resources for processing complex stimuli  <cit> . by contrast, syntactic processing has been associated with the left anterior negativity  and the p <dig> . the lan occurred for example after congruency violations with a similar latency as the n <dig>  <cit> . the lan seems to reflect either relatively automatic syntactic processes  <cit> , and/or working memory load due to complex processing operations  <cit> . the p <dig> has been observed after various syntactic anomalies, such as morphosyntactic violations, and within garden-path sentences  <cit> . it is considered to reflect the processing costs of a re-analysing process after an anomaly detection .

l <dig> learners who are exposed to the l <dig> after puberty have shown lower performance and a higher variability in l <dig> processing compared to native speakers of the same language. a negative correlation between the age of onset of acquisition of an l <dig> and the achieved grammatical competence has been observed in many studies . importantly, lexical-semantic aspects of a language seem to be less affected by a late language acquisition than syntactical and phonological aspects  <cit> .

many studies found that the semantic effect  is robust to effects of age of acquisition   <cit> , whereby the syntactic lan effect was affected to a larger degree. for example, weber-fox et al.  <cit>  found that even l <dig> learners with an aoa of four years did not show a native-like lan. chen et al.  <cit>  investigated chinese l <dig> learners of english: despite accurate grammatical judgements for subject-verb agreement violations, they did not show a lan but a negativity between 500–700 ms. these erp differences between l <dig> and l <dig> learners have been suggested to reflect a reduced automatic language processing in l <dig> learners. in contrast to native speakers, l <dig> learners seem to explicitly recapitulate the words and phrases of the l <dig>  resulting in an additional drain on working memory load  <cit> . these differences in language processing between l <dig> and l <dig> speakers have been explained by the hypothesis of a sensitive  or critical period  for language acquisition in the development of the nervous system, during which learning capabilities are enhanced. according to knudsen’s definition  <cit> , a cp is characterized by an abrupt loss of learning capabilities after its expiration, whereas a sp only implies a considerable decline of learning capabilities after its expiration  <cit> . however, apart from aoa, differences in l <dig> processing are influenced by the similarity between the l <dig> and l <dig> and/or the proficiency level of the participants  <cit> . automatic parsing processes, for example, as reflected in the lan, have been shown in highly proficient l <dig> learners in several erp studies  <cit> .

by comparing the l <dig> processing of  deaf people who had acquired german sign language  as their l <dig> from their deaf parents , and  deaf people who had not been exposed to sign language during the first years of life because they had hearing parents  it is possible to study the effects of a delayed l <dig> acquisition compared to a timely l <dig> acquisition in sign language users when tested in their l <dig> german. german processing was assessed by analysing a group of  hearing german native speakers . both groups of deaf people, esl and lsl, started to learn german at the time of primary school enrolment.

in this regard, mayberry and lock  <cit>  compared the english competence of deaf native speakers of a sign language and hearing native speakers of a spoken language with deaf people with a delayed l <dig> acquisition . all three groups were tested in their l <dig> english. native speakers of a sign language and native speakers of a spoken language performed similarly on a high level. interestingly, deaf people with a delayed exposure to sign language performed significantly worse than both groups of native speakers. chamberlaine and mayberry  <cit>  found further evidence for the notion that strong l <dig> skills in a sign language can scaffold strong skills in the written representation of a spoken l <dig>  these authors  <cit>  suggest that children need the benefits of a natural language irrespectively of its modality for any successful language acquisition. by learning an l <dig> from birth, basic abstract principles of form and structure are acquired that are independent of the sensory motor modality through which a language is expressed. these principles create the lifelong ability to learn a language.

the effects of a delayed l <dig> acquisition on the neural processing mechanisms in a written l <dig> in sign language users have not been investigated yet. using erps, we were able to assess the effects of a delayed l1-acquisition separately on semantic and syntactic aspects of language processing. semantic erps are relatively robust to effects of aoa  <cit> , in contrast to the lan that often differentiates between native speakers and l <dig> learners: l <dig> learners who are not highly proficient usually do not show a lan  <cit> .

predictions
in accord with the findings of mayberry and lock  <cit> , the lsl participants were expected to reach a lower performance level than esl in several language tests  and in the task of the eeg experiment.

with regards to the erp results of the group of egl in accordance with previous findings in native speakers  <cit> , we expected an n <dig> with a centro-parietal topography in the semantic condition. in the syntactic condition we expected a lan at the left anterior clusters l <dig> and/or l <dig> . the lan was expected to be followed by a posteriorly distributed positivity  in the syntactic condition.

for esl a similar n <dig> effect in the semantic condition has been predicted. previous findings have suggested that l <dig> learners who are neither highly proficient nor very familiar with the grammatical phenomenon do not show a lan and/or a reduced p <dig>  <cit> . however, we recently reported both a lan and a p <dig> for esl similar to hearing l <dig> learners  <cit> .

as previous studies give reason to expect differences between esl and lsl  <cit> , we predicted the absence of a lan effect in lsl. since syntactic and phonological aspects of language are generally more vulnerable to aoa effects than lexical-semantic aspects, we also expected an n <dig> effect in the group of lsl  <cit> .

RESULTS
language proficiency tests 
the language proficiency test was run with all deaf participants. one-sided t-tests showed significantly higher performance in esl than lsl in the following subtests of the atbg: tgk  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ), ppvt  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ), and gsv  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). the groups did not significantly differ in the subtest adst  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). the subgroups of lsl and esl who had reached the criterion of at least 60% correct sentence judgements in all conditions of the eeg experiment did not differ significantly in any of the four subtests of the atbg . the results of the atbg are shown in table  <dig>

eeg data
the results of the anovas for each of the three groups of participants  are presented in the following sections. they are followed by between-group comparisons. results for the semantic condition are always reported first, followed by the results for the syntactic condition. erp effects of both the semantic and the syntactic condition were analyzed for the time epochs 300–500 ms and 600–800 ms. for the syntactic condition, the time interval of 300–500 ms was further divided into three sub-epochs of 66 ms each. the anova model comprised the within-group factors condition , hemisphere , and cluster . for the between-groups anovas the factor group  was added.

summary: hearing early german language learners 
in sum, in the semantic condition, egl showed an n <dig> with a typical symmetric centro-parietal distribution and a subsequent symmetrically distributed positivity with a peak at posterior sites. the syntactic condition elicited a lan with a left-temporal distribution that was followed by a right lateralized medially distributed p <dig>

there was no significant effect for time epoch 300–500 ms. however, a significant interaction of co, and he  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) was found for time epoch 300–366 ms, in which the violation effect was significant for cluster l <dig> and l <dig>  . no further significant effects were observed in the time epochs 366–433 ms and 433–500 ms.

between 600–800 ms, a main effect of co  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) and an interaction of co and cl  =  <dig> ; ϵ =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) were observed. the positive difference between the incorrect condition and the correct condition was significant for clusters l3- <dig> and r3- <dig>  .

summary early sign language learners 
taken together, esl showed an n <dig> to semantic violations, which was more pronounced over the right than the left hemisphere. the n <dig> was followed by a symmetrically distributed positive erp effect.

a lan was observed after syntactic violations, which was significant for a sub-epoch of the analysed lan time window. additionally, a symmetrically distributed p <dig> was observed in the syntactic condition.

neither the anova for the time window 300–500 ms nor the anovas for the three 66 ms time epochs revealed any significant effect. a marginally significant co and he interaction was found for the last of the three intervals  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). this interaction was due to a more negative violation effect over the right hemisphere . the t-tests for single clusters revealed a significant negative difference between incorrect and correct conditions for clusters r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> .

summary late sign language learners 
an n <dig> as well as a semantic positivity were observed in lsl. syntactic violations did not elicit a significant lan effect. a p <dig> effect was observed following syntactic violations within 600–800 ms.

syntactic condition
for the time epoch of 300–500 ms, the interaction of gr, co, and he  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig>  was significant in the anova including all three groups.

the comparison of egl and lsl resulted in a significant gr, co, and he interaction  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ) that was due to a negative difference over the left hemisphere for egl and a marginally significant difference  over the right hemisphere for lsl .

for the group comparisons we selected the time epochs within the lan time window for which we observed significant  violation effects . therefore, we used time epoch 366–433 ms for the egl group, time epoch 300–366 ms for the esl group, and time epoch 433–500 ms for the lsl group. the anovas revealed significant differences between all three pair of groups :

esl and lsl: gr*co*he: f =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ; gr*co*he*cl: f =  <dig> ; ϵ =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> .

these interactions show that lsl displayed a right lateralized topography whereas the syntactic violation effect was negative over the left hemisphere in egl and esl.

in the time window of 600–800 ms, the anova for all three groups did not reveal any significant effect involving the factors group and condition. however, the direct comparison of egl and lsl resulted in a significant gr and co interaction  =  <dig> ; p =  <dig> ). a stronger violation effect was present in egl compared to lsl. the anovas of the other pairwise group comparisons - egl and esl, and esl and lsl - did not reveal any significant effects .

summary group comparisons
the group comparisons revealed no significant difference in the semantic condition.

the three time epochs of 66 ms each in which egl and esl showed a significant and lsl a marginally significant effect were chosen to enable a direct comparison of the topographies. this comparison confirmed a significantly different scalp topography of the syntactic violation effect for lsl compared to egl and esl. furthermore, lsl revealed a significantly smaller p <dig> effect than egl.

discussion
in order to investigate the effects of a delayed l <dig> acquisition on the functional organization of an l <dig>  deaf participants who had learned both written german and dgs  at the time of school enrolment  were compared to native signers who had learned written german at a comparable point in time but sign language from birth . both groups were compared to a control group of hearing german native speakers .

only participants who performed above chance level were included in the analyses. all three groups showed an n <dig> effect to semantic violations that was followed by a broadly distributed positivity. these findings are in line with results of neville et al.  <cit> , who reported that the n <dig> was highly similar though slightly prolonged in deaf native signers of asl compared to hearing native speakers in english. our study adds to this report the finding that even deaf people with a delayed l <dig> acquisition displayed an n <dig> effect that was indistinguishable from the n <dig> of both german native speakers and native signers of german sign language. in accord with results from studies investigating aoa effects on semantic processes of the l <dig>  <cit>  our results suggest that the acquisition of semantic aspects of a language are not linked to a sp within the first years of life. this conclusion is supported by the observation that deaf children of hearing parents spontaneously produce semantically meaningful gestures even in an environment in which nobody is able to sign  <cit> .

in the syntactic condition, egl displayed a left temporally distributed negativity which has been considered as an index of early automatic processing  <cit> . interestingly, we observed a similar though overall weaker negativity to syntactic violations in the esl [see also:  <cit> . thus, it might be speculated that the acquisition of a sign language, as a fully developed natural language, might have resulted in the establishment of brain systems important to process the syntax of a human language within the most sensitive developmental periods.

by contrast, we did not find a lan like effect for the lsl. this finding is particularly interesting given the behavioural results. both selected deaf groups did not differ in their performance neither in the syntactic condition of the eeg experiment nor in the corresponding subtests of the atbg. these results suggest that even signers with a delayed l <dig> acquisition who have achieved a relatively high performance level do not show a cerebral organization of syntactic language aspects comparable to people who have grown up with a natural language.

across all participants of both deaf groups, lsl showed lower performances than esl. this finding together with the erp results supplement the observations of mayberry and lock  <cit> , providing evidence for a higher l <dig> competence in deaf native signers compared to deaf people with a late exposure to sign language. thus, access to a natural language, be it spoken or signed, seems to be a prerequisite for the acquisition of syntactic aspects of a written l <dig>  these findings argue against the so called interference hypothesis  <cit> , which postulates that acquiring an l <dig> occupies the neural systems for language processing, thus preventing a proper l <dig> acquisition. hence, a delayed l <dig> acquisition should be an advantage for l <dig> language acquisition in relation to a timely l <dig> acquisition. our results are inconsistent with this prediction.

it should be noted that seven out of fifteen participants from the lsl group and four out of twelve participants of the esl group were not able to perform the eeg task above chance level. the drop-out rates for the two deaf groups did not differ significantly . even among the best performing participants both groups of deaf signers performed worse compared to hearing german native speakers. this general disadvantage of the deaf might be partially due to overall effects of late acquisition, the available impoverished german language input , or the educational situation of deaf people in germany. in the generation of our participants, the ideal of articulation practice and lip reading drills dominated the classroom instead of sign language usage  <cit> . the impoverished opportunities to learn written german might have contributed to the overall lower grammatical competence of deaf participants.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, semantic aspects of an l <dig> seem to be attainable regardless of age of onset of l <dig> acquisition. by contrast, the cerebral organization of syntactic language aspects was shown to be highly vulnerable to a delayed l <dig> acquisition. thus, the opportunity to learn a natural language with all of its syntactic complexity seems crucial for the acquisition of further languages later in life.
