BACKGROUND
historically, mushrooms have been considered as important source of materials in traditional chinese medicine. polysaccharide extracts from mushrooms display immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activities in vivo and in vitro . coriolus versicolor , a medicinal fungus of the basidiomycetes family, has been used as a “magic herb” for promoting good health and longevity. its medicinal value was recorded in the compendium of materia medica and shen non compendium medica thousands of years ago in china . polysaccharopeptide  is a protein-bound polysaccharide extracted from the deep-layer cultivated mycelia of c. versicolor cov- <dig> strain  <cit> . psp, which has an approximate molecular weight of 100kda and is highly water-soluble, appears to be safe during pregnancy. it did not affect ovarian steroidogenesis, ovulation and midterm gestation in mice  <cit> . numerous scientific investigations have demonstrated that psp has anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory and antiviral effects in vivo and in vitro . psp was also found to restore a depressed immunological responsiveness in patients suffering from cancer or in chemotherapy  <cit> . however, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in those functions have not been clearly elucidated.

recent researches indicated that the immunoregulatory effects of polysaccharides are related to the toll-like receptors  signaling pathway  <cit> , and toll-like receptors  <dig>  plays a central role in the enhancement of the innate immune response and the production of cytokine induced by polysaccharides . a family of tlrs plays an important role in the recognition of molecular structures that are shared by many pathogens in the host defense system  <cit> . tlr <dig> is the first mammalian homologue of the drosophila toll protein  <cit>  and recognizes lipopolysaccharide  from gram-negative bacteria, which causes septic shock  <cit> . further study indicates that tlr <dig> is the immune receptor of both ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides  and polysaccharides from astragalus membranaceus  <cit> . in addition, our previous studies have reported that psp has an immunoregulatory effect through the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells   <cit> .

to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms for the immunoregulatory function of psp, based on previous evidences, we focused on investigating the role of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling pathway in the psp-mediated immunomodulation activities. in this paper, c57bl/10sccr mice , c57bl/10 j mice  and the peritoneal macrophages isolated from these two strains were used to demonstrated the immunomodulation mechanism of psp mediated by tlr <dig> signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
psp-induced activation of macrophages through tlr4
the activation of macrophages facilitates the production of many immunomodulatory substances including cytokines. in order to verify if tlr <dig> was required for psp activation of macrophages, peritoneal macrophages from sccr  and b <dig>  mice were incubated with psp  or lps  as a positive control for 24 h and then assayed for tnf-α and il- <dig> concentration in their culture supernatant. as shown in fig.  <dig>  both lps and psp induced tnf-α secretion by peritoneal macrophages from wild-type control b <dig> mice but did not induce tnf-α secretion in sccr mice lacking functional tlr <dig> . similarly, lps and psp failed to induce il- <dig> secretion in sccr mice . these results suggest that tlr <dig> is involved in psp activation of murine macrophages.fig.  <dig> psp-induced tnf-α and il- <dig> production by mouse peritoneal macrophages. b <dig>  and sccr  mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with psp  or lps  for 24 h. tnf-α  or il- <dig>  concentration  in the culture supernatant was determined by elisa. data represent the mean ± sd of three experiments. *p <  <dig>  vs. control . #p <  <dig>  vs. psp 



effect of psp on activation of tlr <dig> signaling pathway in peritoneal macrophages from b <dig>  and sccr  mice
tlr <dig> activates intracellular signaling pathways that lead to the induction of cytokines, such as tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . to elucidate tlr <dig> signaling pathway involved in psp-mediated macrophage activation, we examined activation of tlr <dig>  tlr4-downstream molecules  in tlr4+/+ and tlr4−/− peritoneal macrophages at protein level. after incubation with psp  or lps  for 12 h in 5 % co <dig> at 37 °c, western blot was performed. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the protein levels of tlr <dig> and traf <dig> were upregulated in psp and lps group compared with control group in peritoneal macrophages of b <dig>  mice . the phosphorylation levels of transcription factors nf-κb  and ap- <dig>  were likewise significantly higher in psp and lps group than control group in peritoneal macrophages of b <dig>  mice . no significant differences in those protein expressions were found between groups in sccr  mice, suggesting that the activation was dependent on tlr <dig> signaling pathway.fig.  <dig> psp-mediated activation of tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> in b <dig>  and sccr  peritoneal macrophages. peritoneal macrophages from b <dig>  and sccr  mice were cultured with psp  or lps  for 12 h. the levels of tlr <dig> , traf <dig> , p- nf-κb p <dig>  and p-c-jun  were examined by western blot. data represent the mean ± sd of three experiments. *p <  <dig>  vs. control group. nd = not detected

tlr <dig> expression and signaling in spleens of b <dig>  and sccr  mice exposed to psp
the signaling pathway mediated by tlr <dig> has been implicated in the response to psp in vitro. to clarify whether tlr <dig> signaling pathway is involved in psp-mediated immunomodulation in vivo, we studied the expression at mrna and protein level of tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> in the spleen of b <dig>  and sccr  mice. twenty five days after administration, tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> in psp and lps group  were significantly increased at mrna and protein level relative to those of the saline group in the spleen of b <dig>  tumor-bearing mice . as expected, there were no significant differences in the expressions of tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> among groups in sccr  mice .fig.  <dig> psp-induced changes in tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> expressions in spleens of b <dig>  and sccr  tumor-bearing mice. the mrna level of tlr <dig> , traf <dig> , nf-κb  and ap- <dig>  in spleens of b <dig>  and sccr  mice were measured by q-pcr. the protein level of tlr <dig> , traf <dig> , nf-κb  and ap- <dig>  were tested by western blot. data represent the mean ± sd; n = 4- <dig> mice/ group. *p <  <dig>  vs. saline group. nd = not detected



discussion
psp is well-known for its immunoregulatory effect, attaining widespread usage as therapeutic adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy in china and japan  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that psp could significantly increase the percentage of cd4+ t lymphocytes, the ratio of cd4+/cd8+ and the quantity and percentage of the b lymphocytes and finally enhanced the immune system of cancer patients  <cit> . however, studies concerning the underlying mechanisms involved in psp-mediated immunomodulation effects are very limited. our previous study demonstrated that psp has an immunoregulatory effect through the tlr <dig> signaling pathway in pbmcs from breast cancer patients  <cit> .

the role of tlr <dig> in gram-negative bacterial lps-mediated signaling has been studied extensively  <cit> . our current results indicated that both psp and lps transduces part of signalings via the tlr <dig>  but the biological outcomes are quite different. interestingly, psp has been used to promote health in many asian countries, but concentrated lps of contaminated bacteria causes high mortality in vitro or in vivo  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms for psp or lps in the differential immunity outcomes are not clear.

in our study, to delineate the signaling pathway involved in psp-mediated immunomodulation in vitro, peritoneal macrophages from sccr  and b <dig>  mice were used. macrophages, which provide an important bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, play critical roles in host defense, including phagocytosis of pathogens and apoptotic cells, production of cytokines, and proteolytic processing and presentation of foreign antigens  <cit> . the activation of macrophages facilitates the production of many immunomodulatory substances including cytokines, such as tnf-α, il- <dig> and ifn-γ, which are known to play an important role in suppressing tumor cells. indeed, a variety of plant polysaccharides have been shown to possess immunomodulatory activity through their ability to modulate macrophage function  <cit> . when incubated with psp  and lps  for 24 h, peritoneal macrophages from b <dig>  mice increased their production of tnf-α and il- <dig>  however, production of tnf-α and il- <dig> in psp and lps stimulated peritoneal macrophages from sccr  was significantly reduced . moreover, psp and lps upregulated the expressions of tlr <dig> and tlr4-downstream molecules  in b <dig>  peritoneal macrophages but not in sccr  peritoneal macrophages . as tlr <dig> recognizes lps from most gram-negative species, lps was used as the prototypical tlr <dig> agonist to provide a positive reference. these results suggest that tlr <dig> signaling pathway is involved in psp-induced activation of macrophages in vitro.

to verify whether tlr <dig> signaling pathway is involved in psp-mediated immunomodulation in vivo, we found psp and adm treatment significantly decreased the mean weights of tumors than saline treatment in b <dig>  tumor-bearing mice . at the same time, psp administration significantly increased the thymus index and spleen index relative to adm administration in b <dig>  mice . however, these significant changes were not observed in sccr  tumor-bearing mice . these results indicate that psp could inhibit tumor growth and alleviate the decrease of thymus and spleen induced by adm via tlr <dig> signaling pathway.

in vivo, the activation of tlr <dig> and tlr4-downstream molecules  in spleens of b <dig>  and sccr  tumor-bearing mice were measured by q-pcr and western blot. in q-pcr experiments, vandesompele method, which is more advanced than the pfaffl method, was applied to analyze these data. the vandesompele method normalizes not only with the adjusted pcr efficiency but also with multiple genes. β-actin and gapdh were used as reference genes to assay the relative mrna expression levels. lps was used as positive reference like in vitro study. from the results, we found that the mrna and protein levels of tlr <dig>  traf <dig>  nf-κb and ap- <dig> were significantly upregulated by psp as well as lps in spleens of b <dig>  tumor-bearing mice . at the same time, these significantly differences were not observed in sccr  mice .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our present study demonstrated that psp activates peritoneal macrophages in vitro via tlr <dig> signaling pathway and psp functions its immunoregulatory effect in vivo also via tlr <dig> signaling pathway. these data strongly suggest tlr <dig> signaling pathway is involved in psp-mediated immunomodulatory activities.
