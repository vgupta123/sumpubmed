BACKGROUND
krabbe disease, also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy, is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder affecting both the central nervous system  and peripheral nervous system   <cit> . the disease is caused by the genetic deficiency of galactocerebrosidase , a lysosomal enzyme responsible for the degradation of several glycosphingolipids like psychosine and galactosylceramide  <cit> . the accumulation of galc substrates, especially psychosine, leads to progressive demyelination of axons and death of oligodendrocytes in the cns and schwann cells in the pns  <cit> .

based on the age of onset and severity, krabbe disease is clinically divided into infantile type, juvenile type and adult type  <cit> . the infantile krabbe disease is most common with onset between 3–6 months of age of symptoms including vomiting, difficulty in feeding, extreme irritability, complete blindness, deafness, spastic paralysis, extreme emaciation and dementia, leading to death by 2 years of age  <cit> . currently, there is no cure for krabbe disease. the only approved clinical therapies for krabbe disease are bone marrow transplantation  and umbilical cord blood transplantation , after myeloablative chemotherapy, and such a procedure has only been beneficial in the infantile type if it was performed before the onset of clinical symptoms  <cit> . however, the majority of pre-symptomatic infants receiving transplantation have been reported to develop severe disabilities, including motor and language deterioration  <cit> . moreover, bmt and ucb therapies are limited by the scarcity of donors, and can be complicated by the development of graft versus host disease , a serious and often fatal condition resulting from the immunological attack of foreign t cells against the patient  <cit> . one study had reported that gvhd developed in  <dig> out of  <dig> asymptomatic and  <dig> out of  <dig> symptomatic krabbe disease patients treated with ucb  <cit> .

adipose-derived stromal/stem cells  can be isolated from lipoaspirate following liposuction. ascs have the potential to differentiate into adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes and neuronal cells when stimulated with appropriate induction factors  <cit> . ascs have received increasing attention from both biological scientists and clinicians because of the cells’ ability to differentiate into multiple lineages, the abundance and easy accessibility of adipose tissues, and the feasibility of harvest by a minimally invasive procedure. in addition, ascs have been reported to reduce inflammation  <cit>  and secrete growth, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic factors  <cit> . therefore, ascs from individual krabbe disease patients may be a source of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells for autologous cell therapy. autologous transplantation has lower rates of post-transplant complications and infections compared to allogeneic transplantation. moreover, there are no concerns about donor availability and risk of histoincompatibility in autologous transplantation. autologous ascs offer numerous advantages from regulatory, histocompatibility, and immunological perspectives  <cit> .

the twitcher mouse model was developed through spontaneous mutation of the galc gene at the jackson laboratory in  <dig>  <cit>  and shares many neuropathologic findings with the human infantile type of krabbe disease. in this study, ascs harvested from twitcher mice  and normal wild type mice  from the same litters were culture expanded, characterized, and compared based on features such as differentiation potential, colony forming unit capabilities, cell surface marker profiles, growth kinetics and cytokine expression.

RESULTS
morphology and cell size of twiascs and wtascs
the cell morphology of twiascs was consistent with that of the wtascs, which were fibroblast-like in appearance . the sizes of both cell types were also analyzed based on the forward scatter signals of flow cytometry. as shown in figure 1b, the cell size of twiascs versus wtascs was not significantly different .

flow cytometric analysis of surface antigens on twiascs and wtascs
ascs from twitcher mice and normal wild type mice were isolated, cultured, expanded, and analyzed for surface markers by flow cytometry at passage  <dig>  asc surface markers cd <dig>  sca <dig>  and cd106; hematopoietic markers cd <dig> and cd45; phagocytic lineage marker cd11b; and endothelial marker cd <dig> were tested. as shown in figure  <dig>  both twiascs and wtascs were positive for cd <dig>  sca <dig>  and cd <dig>  both cell types are negative for cd <dig>  cd11b, and cd <dig>  however, there is a significant difference in cd <dig> expression between twiascs and wtascs . the ascs were harvested from three twitcher mice and three wild type mice respectively, and both twiascs and wtascs were repeated three times independently by flow cytometry and similar results were obtained in all studies.

differentiation assays for twiascs and wtascs
twitcher ascs and wild type ascs were cultured in osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks to test their lineage differentiation efficiency. on day  <dig>  the ascs were stained with alizarin red to assess bone mineralization, and with fresh oil red o for lipid droplets. both twiascs and wtascs efficiently differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes . however, as shown in figure 3a, the wtascs appear to have greater differentiation capacity for osteogenic differentiation than the twiascs. quantification of the differentiation levels of both cell types  further demonstrated that wtascs  could differentiate into osteocytes to a much greater degree than twiascs   over the period of the assay. quantification of adipocyte differentiation indicated that wtascs  have a slightly higher capacity than twiascs , but not statistically significant . the graph in figure 3b represents the ratios of od of differentiated cells normalized to control cells.

osteogenic markers in wtasc and twiasc
as shown in figure  <dig>  wtascs appear to have greater differentiation capacity for osteogenic differentiation than the twiascs. to further investigate their osteogenic potentials, replicate cultures of wtasc and twiasc were induced to undergo osteogenic differentiation and harvested on day  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for alkaline phosphatase , runt-related transcription factor  <dig> , and osteocalcin  mrna analysis by real-time pcr. alp catalyzes the hydrolysis of monophosphate esters at a high ph, and it is one of the first functional genes expressed in the process of calcification  <cit> . runx is a bone-specific transcription factor, and it stimulates ocn and other bone specific gene transcriptions via the binding of its runt domain to their promoters  <cit> . ocn, a marker of bone formation, is the most abundant and most widely studied non-collagenous protein in bone  <cit> . as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  wtascs have a much higher alp mrna expression than twiasc on day  <dig> . by day  <dig>  wtascs demonstrated higher expression in all the three lineage markers than twiasc  .

colony forming unit assay
the colony forming unit  assay was used to assess the self-renewal ability of the cells. both twiascs and wtascs were seeded onto  <dig>  cm <dig> nunc cell culture plates at a total of  <dig> cells per plate and the number of colonies was enumerated after 14 days of culture. the cfu assay results  demonstrated that wtascs have a significantly higher self-replicating capacity  than twiascs  .

growth kinetics of twiascs and wtascs
in order to test their proliferative capacity, twiascs and wtascs were plated on  <dig>  cm <dig> nunc cell culture plates at a density of  <dig> cells/cm <dig> and cultured for 10 days. the fold-increase in cell number was analyzed every 2 days throughout the culture period and was calculated by comparing the cell number at each time point to the original plating numbers. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the twiascs have a much slower growth rate than wtascs. for the 10-day culture period, twiascs only had a maximal fold-increase highest of  <dig>  ± <dig>  while wtascs had a maximum of  <dig>  ± <dig> . after that, both twiascs and wtascs reached their growth plateau and started to decline.

regulation of twiascs and wtascs on inflammatory cytokine expression in primary macrophages
the thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal primary macrophages were seeded onto 24-well cell culture plates. after 6-hour incubation,  <dig>  μm pore size transwells were placed in the  <dig> well plates and twiascs and wtascs were added on top of each transwell. the transwell co-culture was incubated overnight followed by stimulation of the cells with lps for an additional 24 hours. the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, il-1α, il-1β, tnfα, il- <dig> and il- <dig> were analyzed by real-time pcr to determine whether twiascs and wtascs could effectively regulate their expression. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  little cytokine production was observed in macrophages in the absence of lps, and lps stimulation triggered an outburst of cytokine production by macrophages, especially the pro-inflammatory il-1α, il-1β, tnfα, il- <dig> cytokines. remarkably, wtasc significantly reduced the macrophage ability to produce il-1α , il-1β , tnfα , il- <dig> , and enhanced the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig> . twiascs demonstrated similar immune-suppressive capacities in vitro as wtascs with the exception that they did not suppress the il- <dig> expression by the macrophages .

discussion
this study compared adipose stem cells from twitcher mice to those isolated from their wild type littermates in order to determine whether ascs with the mutation associated with krabbe disease continue to display normal phenotype. this has relevance to their potential use in future transplantation studies.

from the morphologic perspective, twiascs and wtascs appeared similar with a fibroblast-like morphology and had no significant difference in cell size based on direct observation and on the forward scatter data of flow cyotmetry. both twiascs and wtascs were analyzed by flow cytometry for specific cell surface markers such as cd <dig>  cd <dig>  sca <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd11b, and cd <dig>  the cell surface marker profiles for both cell types were comparable with the exception of cd <dig> expression where there was a significant difference between twiascs and wtascs. the expression of cd <dig> differed as a function of passage numbers for twiascs. it was positive in passage  <dig> as shown in figure  <dig>  but gradually diminished its expression along higher passages, which is typical of ascs in culture . there have been reports showing that cd <dig> is consistently down- regulated while culturing over several passages  <cit> , which is consistent with our findings that twiascs gradually lost their expression of cd <dig> over progressive passages while all other surface markers tested remained the same. however, there have been never detectable levels of cd <dig> expression in wtascs. cd <dig> is a surface marker for hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells and satellite cells. the difference of cd <dig> expression between twiascs and wtascs may be due to differences between the adipocyte niches within adipose depots of twitcher mice and their wild type littermates.

both twiascs and wtascs could be readily differentiated into osteocytes and adipocytes. although the lipid droplets produced by wtascs were larger, in general, than those of twiascs as observed under the microscope, there was no significant difference in the accumulation of neutral lipids between twiascs and wtasc. however, wtascs exhibited an increased differentiation along the osteogenic lineage relative to twiascs. the study of osteogenic markers in differentiated wtasc and twiasc  demonstrated that wtascs, compared to twiascs, have significantly increased levels of expression. alp is a cell surface glycoprotein that is involved with mineralization and its role in mineralization process occurs during early differentiation. measurement of increased alp expression at the mrna level has been taken as a reliable indication of the osteoblastic phenotype  <cit> . ocn is a matrix protein that regulates osteoclast activity, and is a late marker of differentiation at the mineralization stage  <cit> . reduced osteogenic differentiation capacity of twiascs correlated with reduced alp and ocn expression of twiascs, although the mechanism regulating the reduced alp and ocn expression in twiascs is unclear. however, it has been noticed that twitcher mice demonstrated postnatal bone retardation, and contreras and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated that twitcher mice demonstrated osteopenic phenotype, and their bones were much smaller and weighed less compared to normal mice. the same group  <cit>  also reported that the accumulated psychosine induced by galc-deficiency is one of the potential factors that resulted in the stunted bone growth in twitcher mice. psychosine accumulation in twiascs may play a role in their reduced differentiation capacity along the osteogenic lineage.

the colony forming unit assay and growth curve analyses were used to compare the self-renewal and proliferative capacities between the twiascs and wtascs. the results clearly indicated that the twiascs have a significantly reduced ability to form single-cell-derived colonies when plated at low density in comparison with the wtascs. moreover, cultures of twiascs seemed to grow much slower than did their wild type counterparts. however, many studies have demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of ascs are not only solely the results of their capacity for differentiation along mesenchymal and non-mesenchymal lineages, but more importantly related to their immune regulatory capacities  <cit> . macrophages are a key component of the innate immune system and are widely distributed in many different tissues. in addition to their role in initial phases of immune defense, macrophages play an indispensable role in later phases of tissue homeostasis and repair. the interaction of mesenchymal stem cells  with macrophages has been widely investigated in recent years  <cit> . ne’meth et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that mscs increased the il- <dig> production by lps-stimulated macrophages in vitro. they also demonstrated that administration of mscs improved organ function and reduced mice mortality for the treatment of sepsis, and the therapeutic effects of mscs were induced upon their stimulation by il- <dig> produced by macrophages. in our study, the twiascs and wtascs were co-cultured in transwell plates with peritoneal macrophages stimulated by lps, and the in vitro expression of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages was analyzed by real-time pcr. the results indicated that twiascs demonstrated similar immune-suppressive capacities in vitro as their counterparts wtascs. these data suggested that, although twiascs had reduced osteogenic differentiation, self-renewal and proliferative capacities, they are quite similar to wtascs in their anti-inflammatory properties. this is an important finding since the therapeutic effects of adult stem cell therapy had been shown more related to their immune-modulatory capacities.

CONCLUSIONS
ascs from twitcher mice, when compared to ascs from normal mice, have a reduced osteogenic differentiation potential, have less self-replicating and proliferative capacity, although they have the same fibroblast morphology and cell sizes. however, surprisingly, the twiascs demonstrated similar immune-suppressive capacities as their counterparts wtascs did when they were co-cultured with macrophages in vitro. these findings suggest that while the galc deficiency in twitcher mice does influence asc profiles in some aspects, it does not affect their immune-suppressive capacities significantly. these outcomes have relevance since the immune-suppressive function is potentially a critical mechanism that would account for the therapeutic benefit of asc transplantation in krabbe disease.
