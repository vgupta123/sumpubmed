BACKGROUND
upon contact with host mammalian skin, the free-living cercaria of schistosoma mansoni undergoes dramatic biological  <cit>  and metabolic transformations  <cit> . the metabolic transformation is a switch from an oxidative metabolism to a glycolytic metabolism that is reversibly dependent on external glucose concentrations  <cit> . in the mammalian host, glucose transport is facilitated by diffusion through the s. mansoni tegument  <cit> . two closely related  schistosome glucose transporter proteins  have been functionally characterized in s. mansoni, named sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  <cit> . both show stereospecificity for glucose, relaxed specificity for different hexoses and sodium-independent activity  <cit> . differential protein expression profiles show that sgtp <dig> is expressed in the host-interactive outer tegument  <cit> , while sgtp <dig> is mainly located in the basal membranes of the tegument  <cit> . furthermore, western blot analysis showed that sgtp <dig> is expressed in the egg, sporocyst, cercaria, schistosomula, and in adult male and female worms, but sgtp <dig> is only detected in mammalian-stage parasites   <cit> . studies using rnai showed that both sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> were critical for exogenous glucose uptake in schistosomula in vitro and for parasite development in vivo  <cit> .

a third glucose transporter gene, sgtp <dig>  has also been identified. the sgtp <dig> open reading frame was interrupted by a missing base ~260 bp downstream the first initiator atg codon. the hypothetical addition of a base at this downstream position resulted in a translation product homologous to glucose transporters  <cit> . functional assays using xenopus oocytes, however, showed that this hypothetical sgtp <dig> does not transport glucose . in addition, transcripts of the sgtp <dig> gene were only found in adult females  <cit> , possibly due to a specific biological function at this stage. although expressed sequence tags exist for all s. mansoni sgtp genes  <cit> , a fourth glucose transporter, sgtp <dig>  is rarely mentioned in the literature.

the human glucose transporter protein family is divided into three classes: class i comprises glut <dig> to glut <dig> and glut14; class ii comprises glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig>  and glut11; and, class iii comprises glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig> and glut <dig> . these three human glucose transporter classes are phylogenetically differentiated and show distinct molecular properties  <cit> . among the human glucose transporters, glut <dig> and glut <dig> have been well studied and are transcriptionally upregulated under glucose deprivation conditions  <cit> . in terms of primary amino acid sequence, sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> were reported to be homologous to human glut <dig>  <cit> , while sgtp <dig> is more similar to glut <dig>  <cit> .

glucose transporters undergo conformational shifts during glucose diffusion  <cit> . the resolved crystal structure of the proton symporter, xyle, of escherichia coli has a glucose-bound, occluded structural conformation towards the intracellular compartment  <cit> . this occluded conformation disallows glucose diffusion into the cell. the crystal structure of human glut <dig>  possesses a glucose-bound, open-inward structural conformation permitting glucose diffusion within the cell  <cit> . comparing these two homologous transporter structures, deng et al.  <cit>  were able to hypothesize four intermediate conformational shifts during glucose binding and diffusion. xyle and glut <dig> represent the two respective, intermediate and sequential, glucose-bound conformations. the other two are glucose-free that represent conformations before glucose binding and after glucose diffusion  <cit> .

in this study, the evolution of s. mansoni glucose transporters is explored and the effects of glucose-induced transcriptional regulation of the encoded genes were determined. our findings led us to investigate glucose stability and migration with s. mansoni glucose transporters using a publicly available, state-of-the-art algorithm. these results provide insights into the molecular properties, evolution and biophysics of glucose transport in trematodes. unveiling the structural and dynamic differences in glucose transport by parasitic worms can establish the basis for the rational design of schistosome-specific glucose transporter inhibitors.

RESULTS
glucose induces transcriptional changes in s. mansoni glucose transporter genes in schistosomula larvae
regulation of nutrient transporters by nutrient availability is a well-known phenomenon in microorganisms, such as yeast  <cit>  and bacteria  <cit> . the regulation of mammalian transporters by their substrates, however, is less understood  <cit> . nevertheless, the effect of glucose on the transcriptional regulation of glucose transporters has been studied both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . from these studies it is clear that mrna levels of class i glucose transporters glut <dig> and glut <dig>  the most extensively studied in this regard, change in response to the glucose concentration in the medium. as a consensus, glut <dig> and glut <dig> mrna levels are higher under glucose deprivation conditions than in the presence of glucose  <cit> . despite extensive characterization of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> from s. mansoni  <cit> , no study on transcriptional regulation in response to glucose has been conducted. in addition, knowledge of the properties of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> is limited.

upon infection, changes in glucose concentration have been shown to be essential for s. mansoni  <cit> . here we used an infection relevant model to evaluate the transcriptional regulation of the four glucose transporter genes from s. mansoni in presence of glucose. all glucose transporters were expressed in schistosomula 3 h after mechanical transformation in the presence of  <dig>  mm glucose. a significant reduction in expression was observed after 8 h incubation in glucose deprivation conditions . however, when the medium was supplemented with 10 mm glucose we observed a significant change in expression pattern. while the transcriptional levels of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> were downregulated , the transcriptional levels of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> were upregulated  in the presence of 10 mm glucose . the downregulation of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> transcripts was specific to glucose, as the addition of galactose or maltose to the medium resulted in a significant increase  in the transcriptional levels of both genes .fig.  <dig> relative expression of sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> after transformation and adding glucose. the relative expression of sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> , sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  in schistosomula was determined using quantitative rt-pcr. cercariae were mechanically transformed into schistosomula. a total of  <dig>  <dig> schistosomula were incubated for 3 h with traces of glucose . subsequently, glucose, maltose and galactose were added to a final concentration of 10 mm. after 8 h of incubation, total rna was extracted, cdna was synthesized and quantitative rt-pcr was performed. transcripts of sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  were significantly downregulated after adding 10 mm glucose, while sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  were significantly upregulated after adding 10 mm glucose. results shown are the means of three independent experiments. gene expression data is presented relative to 8 h with  <dig>  mm of glucose which was used as “calibrator sample”



our results complement those obtained by krautz-peterson et al.  <cit>  since they showed that rna interference  of both sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> more strongly affected schistosomula when they were maintained in glucose-poor medium than in glucose-rich medium. in glucose deprivation conditions the parasite may increase the expression of these two glucose transporters to maximize the uptake of glucose. thus, inhibiting the glucose transporters in glucose deprivation conditions will be more detrimental to the parasite than in the presence of glucose. the transcriptional expression levels of sgtp <dig> significantly increased in the presence of galactose , but not maltose . in contrast, the transcriptional expression levels of sgtp <dig> significantly decreased in the presence of galactose , but not maltose . these observations suggest that the transcriptional regulation of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> may not be glucose-specific.

s. mansoni glucose transporters cluster separately and evolve at different rates
maximum likelihood , maximum parsimony  and neighbor joining  analyses were performed to phylogenetically characterize the s. mansoni glucose transporters sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  amino acid sequences from glucose and trehalose transporters from the taxonomic classes insecta, mammalia, teleostei, cestoda and trematoda were included in the phylogenetic analyses. all phylogenetic trees had the same topology with each of the above methods. therefore, only one topology  is displayed .fig.  <dig> phylogeny of the trehalose and glucose transporter family. the figure shows a phylogenetic tree of trehalose and glucose transporters from vertebrates, trematodes and insects. the topologies obtained with ml, mp and nj methods were similar, and thus only ml is displayed. numbers on internal branches are the bootstrap values ; the statistical support obtained with approximate likelihood ratio test  was similar. sequences are labeled with data collected from genbank as name of species , type of transporters , number  of the sugar transporter and accession numbers. s. mansoni glucose transporters are indicated by asterisks. homo sapiens glut <dig> and glut <dig> are highlighted in red. the classes of glucose transporters are numbered with roman numerals. d. melanogaster sucrose transporter was used as the outgroup. the labels for the species used are as follow: mammals: h. sapiens , mus musculus , bos taurus ; fish: oreochromis niloticus , neolamprologus brichardi , haplochromis burtoni , pundamilia nyererei , larimichthys crocea , dicentrarchus labrax , maylandia zebra ; insects: anopheles gambiae , aedes aegypti , apis mellifera , bombyx mori , drosophila melanogaster , drosophila pseudoobscura pseudoobscura , gastric caeca , solenopsis invicta ; cestodes: taenia solium , echinococcus granulosus , echinococcus multilocularis , hymenolepis microstoma , fasciola gigantica , fasciola hepatica ; flukes: clonorchis sinensis , s. haematobium , opisthorchis viverrini , s. japonicum 



three classes of glucose transporters have been described in humans that form different phylogenetic clusters  <cit> . we found that s. mansoni sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> clustered together with vertebrate and d. melanogaster class i glucose transporters , while sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> formed a platyhelminthes-specific glucose transporter cluster. the phylogeny presented in fig.  <dig> is consistent with the monophyly of both cestoda and digenea  <cit>  since the two clusters containing glucose transporters from platyhelminthes, cestodes and trematodes clustered separately . the phylogenetic analyses allowed us to classify sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> together with some glucose transporters from the flukes s. japonicum, clonorchis sinensis and the cestodes taenia solium, echinococcus granulosus, e. multilocularis and hymenolepis microstoma as class i glucose transporters. in particular, we found homologs of sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> in both s. japonicum and s. haematobium .

mammalia, platyhelminthes and insecta shared a common ancestor circa  <dig> mya  <cit> . the fact that class i glucose transporters included sequences from platyhelminthes, insects and mammals suggested that this cluster is ancestral to the platyhelminthes-specific cluster. to test this hypothesis we determined the relative divergence times for selected nodes in the  <dig> most parsimonious phylogenetic trees . indeed, the results from this analysis showed that the cluster containing class i glucose transporters is older than the platyhelminthes-specific cluster  with p-value < <dig> . in agreement with this, sgtp <dig> seems to be the oldest glucose transporter in s. mansoni . the relative divergence time of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> suggested that these phylogenetic events coincide in time, and they are recently evolved glucose transporters compared to sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  the phylogenetic position of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> , and the relative divergence times  of these genes support the idea that they originated from sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> respectively, possibly due to gene duplication.fig.  <dig> relative divergence times and evolutionary rates of s. mansoni glucose transporters. the figure displays the relative divergence times of selected nodes from the ml tree topology in fig.  <dig>  class i glucose transporters  and platyhelminthes-specific cluster of glucose transporters  . divergence times for selected branching points were calculated in the  <dig> most parsimonious trees using the ml method based on the lg model . node  <dig>  is older than node  <dig>  with p-value <  <dig> . the colored scale shows the relative evolutionary rates among selected branches . the evolutionary rate  measured as the relative number of amino acid substitutions per site was calculated for selected nodes in the  <dig> most parsimonious trees using reltime method  <cit> . the glucose transporters sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  evolved faster than sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  with a p-value <  <dig>  



gene duplications were reported in glucose transporters from homo sapiens and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . after gene duplication, relaxation of selective constraints on duplicated genes has been observed, resulting in copies that evolve faster than their original orthologs  <cit> . to test variations in evolutionary rates, we estimated these along branches of the glucose transporters phylogeny using the reltime method  <cit> . figure 3c shows that sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> evolved faster than sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> . in addition, sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> were found to evolve faster than sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  respectively with p-value < <dig> .

we further compared the evolutionary rates of sgtp3/sgtp <dig> and sgtp4/sgtp <dig> using tajima’s relative rate test  <cit> . the χ <dig> test statistic was  <dig>   for sgtp4/sgtp <dig> and  <dig>  for sgtp3/sgtp <dig>  thus, the null hypothesis of equal rates was rejected for sgtp4/sgtp <dig>  but not for sgtp3/sgtp <dig>  this suggests that tajima’s relative rate test may not be suited for distinguishing different rates of evolution in fast-evolving sequences like sgtp3/sgtp <dig> or simply that after divergence sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> evolved at the same rates. in agreement with the latter, other sequences from s. japonicum and c. sinensis, in the cluster where sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are located, are also fast-evolving sequences . interestingly, the transcriptional regulation of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> compared with sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> in the presence of glucose  is in agreement with these phylogenetic and evolutionary observations.

the rapidly-evolving glucose transporters sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are encoded by intron-rich genes
the cdna sequence encoding sgtp <dig> originally described by skelly et al.  <cit>  was constructed from a cloned sequence by the insertion of a single nucleotide in order to restore the open reading frame. the authors speculated that sgtp <dig> might therefore be an expressed pseudogene and not encoded as a functional protein. comparison of the sgtp <dig>  cdna sequence to the genome sequence allowed the reconstruction of a “genomic” predicted cdna sequence. three base changes were found within the encoding region, one leading to an amino acid change . since the cdna sequence encodes a full-length protein reconstructed by assembling the exons of the genomic sequence, we speculated that the missing nucleotide in the cdna clone obtained by skelly et al.  <cit>  might represent a cloning artifact. we therefore amplified the full-length coding sequence of sgtp <dig> from cdna derived from adult worms and miracidia and sequenced the clones obtained. however, the examination of twenty such sequences failed to identify a single clone corresponding to the predicted genomic sequence . a number of these contain unspliced intronic sequences, whilst others contained short indels. none of the clones encoded a full-length sgtp <dig> protein sequence. we are therefore unable to verify our speculation concerning the status of the sgtp <dig> gene as a pseudogene or a viable coding gene. one possibility is that the functional transcript might only be produced at specific stages during the life cycle. to compare the sgtp <dig> gene organization and the potential structure and function of the sgtp <dig> protein, we used the transcript and protein sequence predicted by the genome. in contrast we confirmed that the sequence of sgtp <dig> predicted from the genome corresponds to viable transcripts present in adult worms. the transcript sequences were found to be identical to the genome prediction, but have a small deletion at the n-terminal end and to encode a further  <dig> amino acids at the c-terminal end. however, these sequence modifications have no effect on the core glucose transporter structure. the transcript sequence was submitted to genbank .

the schistosome genome sequence and the derived exon/intron structure shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig> are aligned with published transcript sequences of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  the transcript sequence of sgtp <dig> predicted from the genome, and the predicted transcript sequence of sgtp <dig>  we analyzed the gene structure of human glut <dig>  and collected that of glut <dig> from the literature  <cit> , for comparison, since our phylogenetic analyses placed the human glut <dig> and glut <dig> within the same clade as sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  the analysis shows that the gene structures of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are similar to each other, but different from those of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  which are also similar to each other. both sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> have  <dig> introns, four of which are large , the size of the fifth was not evaluated due to missing sequence data. in contrast, sgtp <dig> has  <dig> introns and sgtp <dig> has  <dig> introns. apart from the first intron of sgtp <dig>  which is large and not conserved in sgtp <dig>  the first introns of these two genes are small, between 31 bp and 41 bp, whereas the introns at the 3’ end of both genes are large. moreover, the sizes of exons  <dig> to  <dig> of sgtp <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> of sgtp <dig> are identical and the positions of these introns with respect to the encoded amino acid sequence of the corresponding proteins are conserved. comparison of sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and glut <dig> genes  shows that  <dig> intron positions are perfectly conserved between all, and that the position of introns  <dig> and  <dig> is conserved between all but sgtp <dig>  in addition, glut <dig> shares an intron position  with sgtp <dig>  and sgtp  <dig>  that is not present in sgtp <dig> or sgtp <dig>  overall, this analysis underlines the close relationship between sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> that correlates well with our phylogenetic analysis.fig.  <dig> genomic organization of s. mansoni glucose transporters. the genomic organization of the coding regions of s. mansoni glucose transporters is presented. the genomic organizations of human glucose transporters  <dig>  and  <dig>  are displayed for comparative purposes. exons are represented by solid blue boxes and introns are represented by connecting lines. the sizes of exons and introns are shown in base pairs above and below the boxes and lines, respectively. exons are numbered with roman numerals beneath the boxes. exons coding for different regions of the proteins are highlighted in purple, green and orange. interrogation marks are showing intron positions were information is missing from genome sequences

s. mansoni glucose transporters show typical molecular signatures
despite sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> being clustered separately from class i and ii glucose transporters, they share several molecular properties with these classes . human class i glucose transporters comprise glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig>  glut <dig> and glut <dig> with glut <dig> being the first isoform cloned described by mueckler et al.  <cit> . all members of glut family isolated from humans possess  <dig> transmembrane  α-helices  <cit> , structural patterns that are also present in some glucose transporters from insecta  <cit> . using the tmhmm server we predicted the presence of the  <dig> tm α-helices in sgtp1- <dig> and compared their positions with human class i glucose transporters . the positions of these tms were conserved in the four glucose transporters from s. mansoni, except for the lack of tm <dig> in sgtp <dig>  the only remarkable difference between the amino acid sequence of sgtp <dig> and the other glucose transporters at tm <dig> is the presence of two phenylalanine residues . however, the modelling analysis  showed that sgtp <dig> has the typical  <dig> tm α-helices. the discrepancy between tmhmm and modelling predictions regarding tms in sgtp <dig> can only be solved through the experimental determination of the structure of this transporter. probably due to differences in the algorithm used, the positions of our predicted tm differ slightly from those reported by skelly et al.  <cit>  for sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  we then compared the sugar transporter signatures  <cit>  of human and s. mansoni glucose transporters. some glycine  residues critical for structure stabilization in the glut family  <cit>  were also conserved in the tm α-helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of s. mansoni glucose transporters . the glutamic acid  and arginine  residues implicated in conformational alteration  <cit>  and membrane topology  <cit>  in human gluts were also present in cytoplasmic loops  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of s. mansoni glucose transporters .fig.  <dig> alignment of members of glucose transporters class i. class i glucose transporters amino acid sequences from human  and s. mansoni  were aligned using mafft. relevant motifs among human class i/ii glucose transporters and s. mansoni are highlighted. annotation of relevant motifs was done using previous reports  <cit> . the  <dig> transmembrane  topologies, predicted using tmhmm server v.  <dig>   <cit> , are indicated. the positions of the invariant residues of xyle  and glut <dig>  are marked. the substitution of asn <dig> by lys <dig> found in the genome for sgtp <dig> is boxed . the number of amino acid insertions that resulted from the alignment are shown in brackets




some exclusive characteristics of class i/ii glucose transporters in humans are conserved in s. mansoni. for example, the n-linked glycosylation site  in the first extracellular loop between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  <cit>  and the motif pespr in the sixth intracellular loop between tm <dig> and tm <dig> . sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> showed an amino acid change in the last arg of the motif pespr to threonine  and serine , respectively. despite the improbability of deducing substrate specificity or transport kinetics from the primary amino acid structure of class i glucose transporters, glut <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are known to transport glucose, and not fructose, via a qls sequence present in tm  <dig>  <cit> . this triad sequence has been implicated in substrate binding and is conserved in s. mansoni sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> , but not in sgtp <dig>  in sgtp <dig> there is a substitution of leucine  by phenylalanine  and the same substitution was found in the human glut <dig>  human glut <dig> has low affinity for glucose , which is uncommon among the known members of the glut family  <cit> , but has a high affinity for glucosamine   <cit> . s. mansoni sgtp <dig> does not seem to transport glucose in xenopus oocytes at 10 mm glucose  <cit> , however, further studies should clarify whether this molecule shows a higher km for glucose or whether it has an affinity for glucosamine as does glut <dig>  the presence of glucose transporters with different affinities for glucose is extremely important for the regulation of glucose uptake. for instance, under high glucose concentration conditions an increase in intracellular glucose reduces the glucose influx 50 % in yeast cells expressing high-affinity glucose transporters  <cit> . thus, by regulating the expression profile of the different glucose transporters with different kinetic properties, yeasts avoid affecting their glucose uptake, which is directly dependent on extracellular glucose concentration  <cit> . despite the fact that the hypothesis of glucose transporters with different affinities for glucose in s. mansoni is appealing and matches the expression profile in fig.  <dig>  our biophysical analysis  suggests that neither sgtp <dig> nor sgtp <dig> transport glucose.

the predicted tertiary structural conformations of s. mansoni glucose transporters are homologous to glut <dig> and xyle
upon substrate binding, the tertiary structure of most proteins undergoes conformational changes that coordinate their function. by comparing the structural differences of xyle and glut <dig>  deng et al.  <cit>  were able to hypothesize on the conformational changes of glucose transporters during glucose binding and diffusion. this working model of glucose diffusion predicts that transporters prefer an outward , open, glucose-free conformation . glucose association  and disassociation  trigger the migration of glucose towards an environment with a lower concentration – i.e., the intracellular compartment  <cit> . the final conformation, glucose-free occluded , remains to be structurally resolved.

as proof of principle for our simulations, we submitted the modelled s. mansoni glucose transporters to the dali server  <cit>  to find homologous crystal structures with the best matching conformation. the crystal structures glut <dig> of h. sapiens  and xyle of e. coli  were among the top candidates. this provided two opportunities to control our simulations since,  glucose is not the substrate of xyle, it is a competitive inhibitor and  xyle and glut <dig> are the two sequential intermediate structural conformations during glucose binding and diffusion, respectively  <cit> . the conformational changes during binding occur mainly in tm α-helices  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that cause the occlusion by the intracellular α-helices to open, thereby permitting diffusion  <cit> . root mean square deviation  is frequently used in structural bioinformatics to measure the average distances between atoms from two or more protein structures. the superposition in fig. 6a graphically shows these overall structural differences – the rmsd between xyle  and glut <dig>  is  <dig>  Å.fig.  <dig> xyle and glut <dig> compared to the tertiary predicted structures of s. mansoni glucose transporters. panel a  shows the crystal structures of glucose transporters glut <dig> of h. sapiens  and xyle of e. coli . the transmembrane  α-helices  are numbered  accordingly  with the α-carbon backbone structural alignment of both crystal structures . panel b shows the tertiary predicted structures of s. mansoni glucose transporters  with the structural alignment  of sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  with xyle of e. coli , and sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  with glut <dig> of h. sapiens . structures are color-coded from the amino-terminus  to the carboxyl-terminus . the structural alignment of the α-carbon backbone was performed using the default tool of schrodinger’s maestro program



figure 6b shows the predicted tertiary structures of s. mansoni glucose transporters sgtp1-sgtp <dig> and their structural similarity to glut <dig> and xyle. both sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  are structurally homologous to xyle. sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  are structurally homologous to glut <dig>  the higher rmsd for sgtp <dig> is mainly caused by differences in tm α-helices  <dig> and  <dig>  intracellular α-helices and the c-terminus. these opposing conformations allow us to examine the stability of glucose within the active site of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> and the inability of glucose migration  by sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> 

residue dynamics reveal how glucose affects invariant residues of glucose transporters involved in binding
the dynamics of key residues during substrate binding vary depending on the substrate and the protein. since  <dig>  the key-lock theory to explain protein-substrate complexes has been revised by koshland  <cit>  who proposed an induced-fit process. the induced-fit theory demonstrates that during protein-substrate interactions, conformational changes occur between both the protein and substrate to accommodate the complex. these molecular interactions subsequently cause the global conformational changes aforementioned in fig.  <dig>  to understand how glucose will interact with key residues of glucose transporters, we performed an induced-fit docking simulation using the pele server .

several conserved, invariant residues among glucose transporters  were reported for xyle that, when mutated to alanine , reduce the affinity of substrate binding . these xyle invariant residues are responsible for the competitive inhibitory properties of glucose  <cit>  and showed altered conformations between xyle and glut <dig> crystal structures. the differences in conformation between xyle  and glut <dig>  invariant residues are clearly depicted in the structural representations of fig.  <dig>  large residue conformational shifts between xyle and glut <dig> are seen in gln161/ <dig> , tyr292/ <dig>  and trp388/ <dig> . both tm <dig> and tm <dig> are involved in the two sequential intermediate structural conformations during glucose binding  <cit> . these homologous residues for sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are, however, mutated – in tm <dig> as tyr292/298thr , and in tm <dig> as trp388/392ala  and trp388/392gly  . to simplify matters we refer to the invariant residue positions in the order glut1/xyle, hereafter.fig.  <dig> protein side chain dynamics during glucose induced-fit docking of xyle, glut <dig> and s. mansoni glucose transporters. the line graphs depict the conformational changes of protein side chains in proximity to glucose for glucose transporters glut <dig> , xyle , sgtp <dig> , sgtp <dig> , sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig> . the accepted pele steps  for all simulations were used to calculate the root mean square deviation  of side chain dynamics  – see methods. next to each line graph are the respective initial positions for each residue  of glut <dig>  and xyle  crystal structures with the number indicating the parent tm α-helix . the title of each line graph is color-coded respectively to glut <dig> and xyle. the boxed-in panel is the negative control since it does not directly affect in substrate binding  <cit> . 



the residue dynamics depicted in the line graphs of fig.  <dig> show that gln161/ <dig>  gln282-283/288- <dig>  asn288/ <dig>  tyr292/ <dig> and trp388/ <dig> undergo large conformational changes during induced-fit docking of glucose . fig.  <dig>  however, shows that these dynamics differ depending on the glucose transporter. xyle and glut <dig> show high perturbations for gln161/ <dig> and asn288/ <dig>  but have opposing dynamics for tyr292/ <dig>  and trp388/ <dig> . the s. mansoni glucose transporter sgtp <dig> showed extremely low perturbations for all binding residues, perhaps due to its lower affinity for glucose compared with sgtp <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, sgtp <dig> possesses the most invariant residues with high perturbations, namely for gln161/ <dig>  gln282-283/288- <dig>  asn288/ <dig> and trp388/ <dig>  both sgtp <dig>  and sgtp <dig>  only showed high perturbations for two invariant residues . there is a kink in tm <dig> that contributes to the coordination of the substrate in the active site of glucose transporters in the proximity of polar residues gln282-283/288- <dig> and asn288/ <dig> and the aromatic residue, tyr292/ <dig>  <cit> . the benzene ring of tyr292/ <dig> may act as “trapdoor” switch for glucose since it is thought to maintain the open-inward conformation of glut <dig> by interacting with tm <dig>  <cit> .

biophysical properties of s. mansoni glucose transporters provide insights into glucose affinity
the induced-fit simulations revealed how invariant residues behave upon binding , but what would happen if glucose were unconstrained? to answer this question, we simulated an unconstrained glucose migration starting from the active site. due the importance of tyr292/ <dig> in maintaining the open-inward conformation of glucose transporters  <cit> , we used it to triangulate glucose migration from its initial position in the active site. additional file  <dig> shows distinct glucose migration patterns for glut <dig> and xyle. in accordance with the structural similarities , transcript expression  and evolution , s. mansoni glucose transporters group together in glucose migration patterns showing that in sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> glucose migrates similarly to glut <dig>  while sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are similar to xyle. these migration patterns seem to show glucose either slowly diffusing away from the active site  or being ejected from it . in sgtp <dig>  however, glucose seems to stay within 10 Å of the active site . this concentrated positioning within the active site agrees with the higher affinity that sgtp <dig> has for glucose compared with other sgtps  <cit> .

in order to determine the biophysics of glucose affinity and the direction of migration patterns  we performed two types of analyses:  a cluster analysis to visualize the direction, and,  an incorporation of 3d energy mapping of glucose migration to localize energy favorable clusters. figure  <dig> shows that xyle and glut <dig> possess conversely energy favorable glucose migration patterns. this is strictly caused by the structural conformation of these transporters since both are occluded by the extracellular tms, but differ in the conformation of intracellular α-helices . the open-inward conformation of glut <dig> is the characteristic that permits the diffusion of glucose within the cell. the distinct migration patterns and energy signatures of s. mansoni glucose transporters, however, may explain their individual response to glucose .fig.  <dig> biophysics of glucose migration from the active sites of xyle, glut <dig> and s. mansoni glucose transporters. all 3d plots show the mapping of glucose binding energy  compared to the triangulation of the glucose migratory distance  from the tyr292/ <dig> homologous residue  and the active site  for glut <dig>  xyle, sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig>  sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  the spectrum indicates the energy  from a favorable glucose binding state  to an unfavorable binding state . the contour base on the cartesian coordinates is a 2d representation of the topology for the binding energy map. next to each 3d plot are the graphical structural representations from the cluster analysis  depicting glucose migration from favorable binding energies  to unfavorable ones . one oxygen atom  was used to represent each glucose migration step away from the active site. the final position of tyr292/ <dig> is shown for each structure and each are color-coded from the n-ter  to the c-ter . the lines indicating the position of the membrane is an approximation based on the position in fig.  <dig> – only for demonstration purposes



although sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> are structurally similar to glut <dig>  the energy signatures for both are not comparable to glut <dig>  the energy signature difference between sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> may be due to their slight structural deviations . functional studies showed that sgtp <dig> does not transport glucose, even at 10 mm concentration  <cit> . our transcriptional analysis shows that sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> have opposing responses to glucose compared with sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> , and phylogenetically group together . these functional and evolutionary insights may explain glucose migration for sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> , since it migrates from an energy favorable state  to an unfavorable energy state . our results showed that transcriptional regulation of sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> respond differently to maltose and galactose than do sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> . all these results suggest that glucose is not the native substrate for sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig>  but may act as an inhibitor  since both show energy favorable states within the active site .

glucose affinity is higher for sgtp <dig>  than for sgtp <dig>   <cit>  and this affinity is clearly demonstrated in fig.  <dig>  for sgtp <dig> glucose migrates from an energy favorable state  to an unfavorable energy state . in contrast, glucose spends the majority of the simulation within the active site of sgtp <dig> with unfavorable energy states. we do see, however, that a smaller glucose cluster migrates towards the intracellular compartment with energy favorable states . this may be due to the similarity in structural conformation between sgtp <dig> and xyle , thereby impeding its diffusion by trapping glucose within the active site. the fact that sgtp <dig> differs from xyle and sgtp <dig> in energy and migration patterns may be due to the fact that sgtp <dig> possesses a higher affinity for glucose  <cit>  and that xylose, not glucose, is the native substrate for xyle  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
sgtp2/ <dig>  not sgtp1/ <dig>  are relatively close to human glut1/ <dig>  this conclusion is based on our observations. the phylogenetic analysis shows that sgtp1/ <dig> belong to a platyhelminthes-specific glucose transporter class, while sgtp2/ <dig> clearly belong to class i glucose transporters together with vertebrates and insect glucose transporters. both sgtp <dig> and sgtp <dig> show a genome organization similar to that of glut1/ <dig> and different to sgtp1/ <dig>  sgtp <dig> seems to be the ancestral glucose transporter in s. mansoni and glut <dig> is a structural homolog of sgtp2/ <dig>  thus, the capacity of sgtp1/ <dig> to transport glucose may have evolved independently, while sgtp2/ <dig> apparently lost this capacity after the divergence from the last common ancestor with the other glucose transporters of class i. overall, these observations may permit the development of specific inhibitors for s. mansoni glucose transporters.

a recent review  <cit>  suggested that blocking glucose uptake, as the first step of glucose metabolism, represents an appealing strategy for developing drugs to produce starvation, energy supply deficiency, and mortality in parasitic worms. this is particularly necessary since praziquantel is currently the only treatment available for schistosomiasis and its massive use, notably in sub-saharan africa, has led to concerns about the potential for the development of resistance  <cit> . glucosides, plant-derived compounds with glucose bound to a functional, non-sugar group , have been shown to inhibit glucose diffusion in s. mansoni  <cit>  and could therefore represent lead compounds for developing drugs targeting glucose transport. with the advent of computational biology, the ability to rationally design drugs for specific protein targets has greatly advanced. for example, using the s. mansoni glucose transporter structures, the aglycone could be altered to computationally test for stability and affinity of the designed glucoside. the top glucoside candidate could then be experimentally analyzed for effectiveness. since glucosides are non-transportable  <cit>  they could “trap” themselves in the active site to maintain the structural conformation similar to sgtp <dig> in fig.  <dig> – i.e., the glucose-bound, occluded conformation of xyle. one of the caveats of the pele algorithm is that it cannot perform large protein conformational changes, as those described by deng et al.  <cit> . such simulations to rationally design drugs will benefit from other molecular dynamics software such as desmond  <cit> .
