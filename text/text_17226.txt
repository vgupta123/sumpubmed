BACKGROUND
sexually dimorphic behaviors including types of displays, such as vocal or sexual behaviors, occur across diverse species. particularly elegant work exists on the development of song and the brain regions associated with it in zebra finches. adult behavior is highly dimorphic. only males sing, and they learn songs from their fathers beginning around day  <dig> .

most brain regions that control song are sexually dimorphic in adults  <cit> . they include the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium , area x in the basal ganglia, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium , and hvc . area x and lman are important in song development, as lesions to these areas impair song learning  <cit> . area x, while large in adult males, is not visible in females  <cit> . lman volume is sexually monomorphic, although as in other brain regions soma size is increased in males compared to females  <cit> . hvc and ra are involved in the motor production of song, and are substantially smaller in adult females than males  <cit> .

mechanisms regulating sexual differentiation of the song system are unclear. administering estradiol to females early in development partially masculinizes song nuclei, and if followed by testosterone treatment in adulthood, allows females to perform rudimentary song  <cit> . these results have implicated steroid hormones in the masculinization of both structure and function. however, other data are inconsistent with this idea. for example, initial sexually dimorphic development of hvc appears independent of androgen and estrogen  <cit> . castration of young males  <cit>  and treatment with anti-estrogens  <cit>  or with estrogen synthesis inhibitors  <cit>  fail to inhibit masculine development. additionally, sex differences in plasma steroid levels during development have not been conclusively identified  <cit> .

genotypic sex directly influences the relative expression of many sex-linked genes in birds; gene dosage compensation is limited  <cit> . the potential impact of cellular genotype on brain development was illustrated by a rare gynandromorphic zebra finch in which gonads and plumage were masculine on the right side but feminine on the left  <cit> . brain cells on the right appeared to have a male  genotype, but on the left were female , and hvc morphology was also lateralized. more recently, several genes have been discovered to exhibit increased expression in the song nuclei of juvenile males, including tyrosine kinase b  <cit> , secretory carrier membrane protein  <dig>  <cit> , estrogen coactivator l7/spa  <cit> , and ribosomal proteins  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . thus, it is likely that genes and hormones, acting together within the song system, produce sex differences in singing behavior.

the goal of the present study was to identify additional genes involved in masculinization of the song system. to accomplish this, we screened developing zebra finch brains using a species-specific cdna microarray, and followed up on  <dig> of those exhibiting the greatest sex difference. this male-biased expression was validated in a separate set of individuals by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction . for the genes with expression that remained significantly different, in situ hybridization was used at day  <dig> post-hatching to evaluate localization in song control nuclei as in  <cit> , to capture a period when morphological differentiation is enhanced as well as early phases of song learning.

methods
animals and tissues
all tissue for all experiments was collected from animals living in large colony cages containing multiple males and females, along with their offspring. the day of hatching was targeted to identify genes that might influence very early stages of song system development   <cit> . at day  <dig>  morphological differentiation of the neural song system is well underway  <cit> , and both males and females are likely beginning to form templates of their fathers' songs  <cit> . post-hatching day  <dig> is about mid-way through sensorimotor integration, a process that only occurs in males. for the microarray analysis, individual whole telencephalons  were collected following rapid decapitation from zebra finches at post-hatching days  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  as well as from adults . brains were stored at -80°c until processing. gonadal sex was determined using a dissecting microscope.

microarrays
cdna microarrays were used following the procedures of the songbird neurogenomics initiative ; the present study was identified as experiment # <dig> in the planned community collaborations  <cit> ). each array contained  <dig>  spots, representing  <dig>  unique genes, compiled from three zebra finch telencephalic libraries.

rna extraction, cdna synthesis and array hybridization using a two-color universal reference design were as described  <cit> . briefly, total rna was prepared using tri reagent . it was dnase i treated  and cleaned using spin columns . rna  was amplified using the low rna input fluorescent linear amplification kit . the resulting arna was reverse transcribed using an indirect aminoallyl incorporation protocol and labeled with either cy <dig> or cy <dig> dyes . for the present study, each of the  <dig> samples was hybridized to a separate array, and each array was also hybridized to a common reference . the reference was prepared as described in  <cit>  and included rna from adults of both sexes. dye labeling was balanced within groups. slides were hybridized overnight at 42°c using slidehyb # <dig> hybridization buffer , then washed with a series of standard saline citrate solutions, centrifuged to dry, and scanned using an axon genepix 4000b  microarray scanner. all slide images were analyzed using genepix pro  <dig>  software. analyzed slide images were manually edited and aberrant spots were flagged for exclusion.

data were analyzed as follows. the log <dig> transformation of the ratios of the loess-normalized sample:reference fluorescence intensities was used for statistical analysis. these log ratios were not corrected for background in order to provide the most stable and least variable responses in line with recent recommendations  <cit> . the log ratios were normalized for potential dye intensity bias using the loess smoothing procedure advocated by yang et al.  <cit>  based on the smoothing span parameter set to  <dig>  for all arrays. subsequent to loess normalization, the interquartile ranges  of the log-ratios were standardized to be of the same magnitude as the average iqr across arrays similar to that described in yang et al.  <cit> . a global mixed model approach, analogous to the first stage model of wolfinger et al <cit> , was used to further correct the log ratios for the global  effects of dyes and arrays. the residuals from this analysis were then corrected for array-specific print-tip and print-tip by dye effects in a series of second substage model analyses conducted separately for each array. the residuals from these analyses were used as the final normalized data for statistical inference in testing the experimental effects of interest.

the final normalized data were analyzed by a series of cdna-specific linear models that include the effects of dye, sex, age and sex by age interaction, thereby allowing for estimated residual variances that are cdna-specific  <cit> . anova-based f-tests were then used to establish statistical significance for the overall effects of age, sex, and age by sex. the procedure of storey and tibsharani  <cit>  was used to estimate the false discovery rates  for each of these effects across genes.

gene identification
the est-derived probes on the microarray had been previously annotated by automated blast analysis against other genomes  <cit> . clones were also re-sequenced prior to qpcr . for the six targets of specific interest in the present study , we conducted additional manual annotation using data from the ongoing whole-genome sequencing project for the zebra finch available through the trace archives at the washington university genome sequencing center . in  <dig> cases we were able to confirm identifications by identifying genomic flanking sequences and constructing larger contigs which were then evaluated by blastn. identities of the other three genes remain unknown; no homologues were found in the ncbi database at the time of this writing.

real-time qpcr
whole telencephalons were collected from 25-day-old male and female zebra finches after rapid decapitation, and were immediately frozen on dry ice. the sex of each animal was determined by examining the gonads under a dissecting microscope. samples were stored at -80°c until use.

rna was isolated using methods described previously  <cit> . briefly, samples were extracted with trizol , and dnase treated on rneasy mini-columns  per manufacturer's instructions. rna was ethanol-precipitated to increase the concentration, which was then determined by spectrophotometry. integrity of the rna was confirmed on 1% denaturing agarose gels.

from the arrays,  <dig> genes were selected for further analysis, based on a large magnitude of sexual dimorphism , and in some cases a known homologue or location on the z chromosome . all clones were re-sequenced from the 5' end on an abi prism  <dig> genetic analyzer  using t <dig> primers. the data were compared to those from the array . each matched its counterpart to a high degree . as in wade et al.  <cit> , cdna was simultaneously made from the individual telencephalic samples from  <dig> males and  <dig> females using the high capacity cdna archive kit  per manufacturer instructions. these samples, along with no-template controls were run in triplicate with each of  <dig> primer sets. in all cases, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was analyzed in parallel as a control. it was used both to document a lack of sexually dimorphic expression of a housekeeping gene and as a basis for normalization when calculating fold-differences between the sexes . primers were designed using primer express  <dig>  . the efficiency of amplification for each set was at least 99% , and in no cases were primer dimers produced. reactions consisted of  <dig> nm of each primer and cdna equivalent to  <dig> ng total rna for each individual. power sybr green pcr master mix , was added according to manufacturer's instructions. the reactions were run on an abi prism pe  <dig>  using the default program.

the triplicate cts  from each individual were averaged, and sex differences were evaluated by two-tailed t-tests. bonferroni corrections were used . average ratios of male to female expression were calculated using ΔΔct <cit> .

in situ hybridization
colonies used to generate probes were obtained from glycerol stocks, and plasma dna was isolated using wizard plus minipreps . clones were re-sequenced as described above. to obtain t <dig>  & t <dig>  probes we used qiagen maxi prep kit , and linearized the templates using xhoi  and noti . in all cases, t <dig> was the anti-sense strand and t <dig> was the sense strand. cold transcription reactions were performed to confirm product quality and the correct size.

six birds of each sex were rapidly decapitated at post-hatching day  <dig>  whole brains were frozen in cold methyl-butane and stored at -80°c. they were coronally sectioned  and mounted onto superfrost plus slides . six series of sections representing the whole telencephalon were collected, and stored at -80°c with desiccant.

in situ hybridization for each mrna was conducted as in  <cit>  and  <cit> . two adjacent sets of tissue sections from each animal  were warmed to room temperature, rinsed in phosphate buffered saline , fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in  <dig> % diethylpyrocarbonate-treated  water, followed by pbs. slides were incubated for  <dig> minutes in  <dig> % acetic anhydride in  <dig>  m triethanolamine, rinsed in pbs, and dehydrated in ethanols, and air dried for  <dig> minutes. they were pre-hybridized in a solution containing 1× hybridization buffer  and 50% formamide at 55°c for  <dig> hours. slides were then hybridized overnight at 55°c with  <dig> μl of 1× hybridization buffer, 10% dextran-sulfate, 50% formamide, and  <dig> ×  <dig> cpm 33p-utp-labeled rna probe . these probes were prepared using the maxiscript in vitro transcription kit with t3/t <dig> rna polymerases . the next day, slides were removed from hybridization buffer and washed sequentially in  <dig> × ssc and  <dig> × ssc at 55°c and room temperature, followed by an incubation in  <dig> × ssc with rnase a  at 37°c for  <dig> minutes with slow agitation. slides were then rinsed in  <dig> × ssc at 37°c for  <dig> minutes and briefly in  <dig>  × ssc at 60°c. the tissue was dehydrated in ethanols with  <dig>  m ammonium acetate. slides were air dried and exposed to hyperfilm mp  with an intensifying screen  at -80°c for four days to confirm signal and check for enhanced expression in song system nuclei, and were then dipped in ntb emulsion  and incubated at 4°c for three to six weeks depending on the abundance of mrna. they were then developed using kodak professional d- <dig> developer and fixer  and lightly counter-stained with cresyl violet.

for the probes demonstrating specific labeling in one or more of the song nuclei , the density of silver grains was assessed as follows. without knowledge of the sex of the birds, each brain area of interest was first located using brightfield microscopy . the density of labeling was quantified in  <dig> animals of each sex  and on both sides of the brain in all sections in which each region of interest was readily identifiable . the area covered by silver grains within a  <dig> μm ×  <dig> μm box was determined using density slice function in nih  image on darkfield images. in lman, hvc and ra, this box covered approximately 95% of the total area in females and roughly 50% of the hvc and ra of males as they are larger; the overall size of lman is similar in the two sexes. the box also covered about 50% of area x in males . for each anti-sense treated section, an adjacent sense section was quantified. the control, sense, values were then subtracted from the corresponding antisense values, and the resulting specific densities were averaged across sections within individuals. a t-test was conducted for each brain region for each gene, and the alpha-level was set based on the number of brain regions measured for each gene .

southern blot analyses
for genes with enhanced mrna expression in male song nuclei, we verified their location on the z chromosome by documenting significantly increased labeling in males versus females on genomic southern blots. the location was later confirmed using blastn to compare our sequences to the  <dig> release of the zebra finch genome . for the southerns, whole blood was collected from adult individuals of both sexes in heparinized capillary tubes after alar venipuncture, and stored at -20°c. genomic dna was isolated using qiagen dneasy blood and tissue isolation kit  following manufacturer's instructions . concentration was determined by spectrophotometer. dna  was then digested overnight at 37°c with hindiii, or, in one case, ecori .

digested dna from  <dig> adult males and  <dig> females was loaded onto a  <dig> % agarose gel, with samples from each sex in alternate lanes, and run at approximately  <dig> volts for  <dig> days, or until the bromphenol blue dye front was at the bottom of the gel. it was depurinated for  <dig> minutes in  <dig>  n hcl, rinsed, denatured for  <dig> minutes in  <dig> m nacl and  <dig>  m sodium hydroxide, and rinsed again. the gel was neutralized for  <dig> minutes in  <dig>  m nacl in  <dig>  m tris. after a final rinse, it was soaked in  <dig> × ssc. the dna was transferred to a hybond-n+ membrane  overnight, and fixed using a uv stratalinker . probing for the six genes of interest was conducted across three replicate membranes. after stripping the membranes, they were then re-probed for gapdh as a control . after a  <dig> minute wash in  <dig> × ssc buffer, the membrane was prehybridized at 68°c for at least one hour in  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> × denahrdts,  <dig> % sds, and  <dig> mg of denatured herring sperm dna . the membrane was then hybridized for  <dig> days at 68°c in  <dig> × ssc,  <dig> × denhardts,  <dig> % sds,  <dig> ng denatured dna, and  <dig> ×  <dig> cpm probe.

probes were individually prepared using  <dig> ng of template that was amplified using  <dig>  units of platinum taq high fidelity  with  <dig> mm magnesium sulfate,  <dig>  mm dntps ,  <dig> μm dctp,  <dig> μm t <dig> & t <dig> primers, and  <dig> μci 32p-dctp.

following warming at 94°c for  <dig> minutes, reactions were subjected to  <dig> cycles of: 94°c for  <dig> seconds, 55°c for  <dig> s, and 68°c for  <dig> to  <dig>  minutes , with a final extension at 68°c for  <dig> minutes. probes were purified using a spin column containing g <dig> sephadex beads  in nets. membranes were washed at 68°c in  <dig> × ssc with  <dig> % sds twice for  <dig> minutes, and in  <dig> × ssc with  <dig> % sds twice for  <dig> minutes prior to exposure to hyperfilm mp  at least overnight at -80°c, depending on the strength of the signal.

the mean optical density of the band of interest for each individual was quantified using nih  image. this value was divided by the value for the corresponding gapdh band. the resulting data were analyzed using t-tests with .

RESULTS
microarrays
we detected  <dig> spots on the array that showed significant effects of sex , half of them  with increased expression in males compared to females. however, of the targets with average effect sizes of  <dig> -fold or greater,  <dig> were increased in males and  <dig> increased in females. a very large number  of the cdnas exhibited a significant effect of age. this result is not particularly surprising, as the four ages investigated span the entire period of maturation for these birds, thus countless structural and functional changes in the brain would be expected. a relatively small number of cdnas expressed a significant sex × age interaction, just  <dig> of the more than  <dig>  spots on the array. these will be pursued in the future.

as our present goal was to identify genes involved in any aspect of masculinization of the song system, we chose to follow up on a set of  <dig> with increased expression in males compared to females across all ages. most of these genes were initially selected based on substantially greater expression in males compared to females and location of the orthologous sequence in chicken on the z chromosome . in a few cases, genes were chosen for further analysis due to a high degree of sexual dimorphism in the absence of additional information. because some gene identities have not been established , we use genbank accession numbers here to label genes.

qpcr
of the  <dig> cdnas chosen for further analysis,  <dig> showed male-biased expression via qpcr . two of these, with genbank accession numbers dv <dig> and ck <dig>  represented cdnas from the same gene, sorting nexin  <dig> . therefore, dv <dig> was excluded from further analyses. gapdh expression never differed significantly between the sexes.

amagnitude of sex difference 

ck <dig>  showed specific expression in two song nuclei – area x and lman. in both cases, it was increased in males compared to females .

dv <dig> was also expressed in area x and lman, but not in hvc or ra. males showed significantly higher levels of expression than did females in both areas .

three of the four song nuclei  exhibited specific labeling indicating snx  <dig> mrna . it was increased in males in area x and hvc . expression between the sexes, however, did not differ in lman .

ck <dig>  showed enhanced expression compared to surrounding tissue in lman, area x, and hvc, but not in ra. males had higher levels of expression in hvc than did females . the sexes did not differ in the other two areas .

ck <dig> mrna appeared specific to lman and hvc. in hvc, it was increased in males compared to females . males also showed somewhat higher levels of expression than did females in lman, though this difference was not statistically significant .

only one area, lman, showed specific labeling for ck <dig>  with the intensity substantially greater than in surrounding tissue. it, however, did not significantly differ between the sexes . results for ck <dig> were the same .

southern blot analyses
the corrected optical density representing each of the six genes with sexually dimorphic expression in the song system was significantly higher in males compared to females . in parallel, each of the sequences represented in table  <dig> shared substantial identity with portions of the zebra finch z-chromosome .

discussion
we found robust sex differences in gene expression in the developing zebra finch brain, and identified six genes that are both sex-linked and differentially expressed in the male compared to female song system. this is the period when song memories are first forming and morphological differentiation is occurring at a rapid rate  <cit> .

all six of these genes map to portions of the z chromosome in zebra finches , and our southern blot analysis confirmed they are z-linked in zebra finches. most z-chromosome mrnas in birds exhibit increased expression in male compared to female birds, as dosage compensation is limited  <cit> , unlike the analogous situation in mammals where dosage compensation prevents enhanced expression in females of most x-linked genes. we anticipate that a number of the ~ <dig> sex-biased genes we detected in our microarray study will map to sex chromosomes. however, local dosage compensation does exist in birds and varies across ontogeny and tissues, which suggests some active regulation associated with key functions  <cit> .

out of the eleven genes we initially chose for analysis by in situ hybridization, three  showed sexually dimorphic expression via qpcr on rna/cdna from the whole telencephalon, but the mrna was neither confined to nor enhanced in song nuclei. of the eight remaining, two  appeared to show specific expression in lman, but significant sex differences were not detected via in situ hybridization. the results from these five genes thus might reflect either a generalized increase in males, or stem from specific, functional increases in regions of males outside of the song control system.

the other six genes appear important for the song system specifically, since expression was higher in song system nuclei relative to surrounding tissue. importantly, sexually dimorphic expression of each of these genes is localized to particular brain areas. for example, while some mrna was detected outside of the song nuclei, expression of all six was clearly enhanced in lman compared to neighboring tissue, yet significant sex differences within lman existed for only half of them. similarly, five of the genes showed increased expression in area x compared to the surrounding tissue, and of these, four exhibited significantly greater expression in males than females while one did not. if one considers the six individual genes across the four song nuclei investigated, not one of them showed sexually dimorphic expression in all of the areas . these indications of specificity imply restricted functions, and the pattern of expression provides some clues as to the details regarding mechanism.

lman
lman is involved in song learning. lesions early in development disrupt normal learning in males but in adulthood do not alter singing behavior  <cit> . lman volume is relatively large at day  <dig> in both sexes, and begins rapidly regressing thereafter  <cit> . sex differences are apparent in cellular structure of lman, even though the region is volumetrically monomorphic: nucleoli and neuronal soma sizes are larger in males relative to females  <cit> . in males, lman projects to ra early , and this connection reorganizes  around day  <dig>  <cit> . the regression of terminals from lman is correlated with the entrance of axons into ra from hvc  <cit> . increased expression of the synelfin  gene has been detected in male lman during this developmental period  <cit>  with subsequent changes in the presynaptic protein in terminals onto ra  <cit> .

three genes showed significantly enhanced expression in the lman of males relative to females at post-hatching day  <dig> . ck <dig> has been identified as methylcrotonyl-coa carboxylase beta chain, and is involved in the catabolism of leucine, important for releasing energy in the brain  <cit> . increased leucine catabolism is marked during operant conditioning training in mice  <cit> , and humans deficient in 3-methylcrotonyl-coa carboxylase can exhibit motor deficits, learning disabilities, attention-deficit disorders, as well as a reduction in white matter  <cit> . these findings suggest that ck <dig>  and possibly the other two genes, may facilitate song learning. they might interact with nmda receptors, as mk- <dig>  binding was higher in lman at day  <dig> than in adults, and injections given to juvenile males between day  <dig> and  <dig> impaired song learning  <cit> .

area x
area x is involved in learning patterns of motor production for song  <cit> . lesions of area x during song learning disrupt vocal output and prevent song crystallization  <cit> . at this age, area x in males is approximately half the adult volume, but rapidly increases with recruitment of new neurons  <cit> . this area never develops in females  <cit> . hvc projects to area x by day  <dig> in males  <cit> .

four mrnas investigated in the present study were enhanced in area x of males relative to females, and three of these exhibited the same pattern in lman . since area x and lman are both involved in song learning, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these genes play some role in this process.

ck <dig>  identified as sorting nexin  <dig> , showed enhanced expression in area x of males. in mammals, snx <dig> is a retromer component  that is important during development, especially in the degradation of chemicals, including toxins  <cit> ; the deletion of snx <dig> and structurally similar snx <dig> simultaneously in mice embryos has lethal consequences  <cit> . depletion in humans of other, related, retromer subunits, vps <dig> and vps <dig>  which require either snx <dig> or snx <dig> in order to associate with endosomes, increases amyloid-β peptide production associated with alzheimer's disease  <cit> . since the formation of amyloid plaques is implicated in memory deficits, snx <dig> might be involved in maintaining neural circuitry that is essential for learning in males.

hvc
hvc is involved in motor output of song and is thought to be the primary entry of auditory information into the song pathway  <cit> . it has connections to both motor learning and output nuclei; one that projects to area x develops at day  <dig>  and one to ra around day  <dig>  these projections are absent in females  <cit> . although hvc is already sexually dimorphic in volume and cell number at day  <dig>  new neurons are recruited in males until day  <dig>  and this region does not fully mature until day  <dig> . cell death begins around day  <dig> in females, and leads to further differentiation of the region  <cit> .

three mrnas exhibited enhanced expression in males relative to females  in hvc, including snx <dig> . given that hvc and area x, which showed a similar sex difference, are both incorporating cells during this period, snx <dig> may promote the survival or incorporation of new cells.

two genes, ck <dig> and ck <dig>  showed sexually dimorphic expression in only one brain area, hvc. at day  <dig>  this area is unique in that it is the only song region that contains substantial levels of estrogen receptors  <cit> . additionally, the closing of the song template formation phase  is marked by a decrease in estrogen receptor-immunoreactive cells activity in male hvc  <cit> . ck <dig> might play a role in the decreased estrogen receptor activity, as it converts estradiol into estrone, for which estrogen receptors have a lower affinity  <cit> . ck <dig> may serve similar functions, promoting cell survival in hvc, or preventing cell death. ck <dig> may also interact with androgen receptors, since androgen receptor binding increases markedly beginning at day  <dig> in both hvc and lman  <cit> .

ra
ra projects to the respiratory tract and syrinx necessary for producing song  <cit> . this song nucleus receives inputs from two other song regions: lman and hvc  <cit> . sexual differentiation of ra morphology occurs earlier than other song nuclei ; volumetric differences between the sexes are largely due to cell death in females  <cit> . however, synaptic densities and neuron soma sizes increase in males  <cit> .

ck <dig> showed enhanced expression in the ra of males. it was also increased in males in lman, an area that also has strong connections with ra early in development. since lman likely affects the synaptic rearrangement in ra, this gene may play a role in the shift in connectivity  that occurs at this age.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified more than  <dig> putative genes with sex differences in expression across multiple ages in zebra finches; of a subset analyzed with qpcr,  <dig> mrnas  with substantially greater expression in males were validated using qpcr. sex differences in mrna expression for six were localized to one or more song control regions. the patterns of gene expression were not uniform across the song system, which allowed the formulation of some hypotheses regarding the function of these genes. in particular, we have identified genes that may facilitate cell incorporation and cell survival, or that may enhance or maintain learning and memory circuitry. as all are located on the z-chromosome, they have the potential to be early players in the cascade of events causing masculinization of the structure and/or function of the song system. future studies will focus on the mechanisms through which that occurs, including whether and how they may alter the way the brain responds to steroid hormones in the sexual differentiation process.
