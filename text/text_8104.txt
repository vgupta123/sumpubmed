BACKGROUND
basommatophora  is a suborder comprising essentially all pulmonate gastropods living in freshwater. basommatophorans are monophyletic and encompass five families: acroloxidae, chilinidae, lymnaeidae, physidae, and planorbidae   <cit> . the group contains ~ <dig> species and has been extensively studied because some species have a role in transmitting parasites of human and veterinary importance . the lymnaeidae, physidae and planorbidae comprise ~90% of the basommatophoran species  <cit> . the phylogenetic relationships within the physidae and planorbidae are now well established . however, the phylogeny of the lymnaeidae has only been partially inferred  <cit>  and we currently lack a comprehensive treatment of this family.

lymnaeidae snails are distributed worldwide  <cit> . they are of major medical and veterinary importance since they act as vectors of parasites that severely affect human populations and livestock, and cause important economic losses  <cit> . indeed, lymnaeids serve as intermediate hosts of at least  <dig> trematode species distributed among  <dig> families  <cit> , including some species of schistosomatidae and echinostomatidae, with implications for human health  <cit> , and paramphistomum daubneyi, which is of veterinary interest  <cit> . undoubtedly, the most emblematic case of parasite transmitted by lymnaeids is fasciola hepatica , the agent of fascioliasis. the disease it causes is recognized as a major veterinary problem as it is responsible of the loss of productive capacity . fascioliasis is also an important human disease with about  <dig> million cases around the world  <cit> . fasciola hepatica presumably originates from europe and now has a worldwide distribution. the definitive hosts of this parasite are vertebrates, usually mammals, e.g., cows, sheep, goats, buffalos, and also humans. mollusks, generally lymnaeids, are required as intermediate hosts to complete the life cycle. at least  <dig> species of lymnaeidae have been described as potential vectors of fascioliasis . due to the important role of these species as intermediate hosts of trematodes, a solid phylogenetic framework of lymnaeidae is required. the correct identification of intermediate-host species should help characterize areas of epidemiological risk and increase our understanding of the evolution of the lymnaeidae- fasciola host-parasite interaction.

lymnaeidae exhibit a great diversity in shell morphology which is linked to substantial eco-phenotypic plasticity . hubendick  <cit>  illustrated this point by compiling up to  <dig> species names, a large number of which he synonymized. in contrast, the anatomy of their reproductive tracts  is extremely homogeneous . immunological  <cit> , cytogenetical  <cit> , enzyme electrophoresis studies  <cit> , and dna-based approaches  <cit>  have demonstrated extensive homoplasy in anatomical characters  <cit> . the difference between patterns in shell morphology and anatomy explains why lymnaeid systematics has been controversial  <cit> . today, it is accepted that the total number of species might be less than  <dig>  <cit> , with most occurring in the palearctic and nearctic regions  <cit> . although some effort has been done to resolve their phylogenetic relationships, the small number of genes or species considered  and limited geographical coverage  represent severe limitations and biases. furthermore, some well-recognized species have never been considered . these limitations and biases have generated gaps in our understanding of their biogeographic patterns, and their epidemiology in areas of high endemicity of trematode diseases .

in this paper, we contribute to fill these gaps by performing a phylogenetic analysis using a supermatrix approach. we infer the most complete phylogeny to date in lymnaeidae using sequences of  <dig> taxa  covering most neotropical species . using this phylogenetic framework, we analyze how susceptibility to infection by f. hepatica and f. gigantica  has evolved. in addition, this phylogeny allows us to establish biogeographic aspects, to pinpoint potential biological invasions, and determine the evolution of chromosome numbers.

methods
sampling
sequences of one to three genes among the two nuclear internal transcribed spacers of the ribosomal dna  and the mitochondrial  <dig> s ribosomal dna of  <dig> lymnaeid species and two outgroups, the planorbids bulinus forskalii and biomphalaria tenagophila , were retrieved from genbank . we chose these three genes because they are highly variable and have been extensively used in phylogenetic studies of lymnaeidae. they represent most known clades of this family . in addition, living individuals of  <dig> lymnaeid species and an additional outgroup, physa acuta , were collected in  <dig> populations sampled in a variety of countries/continents . sampled individuals were stored in 80% ethanol for dna analyses.

species in bold characters were sampled by us. na: not available.

genus names are still fluctuating in lymnaeidae. however, we conserved the names given in genbank for the sequences retrieved there in order to facilitate comparisons between this and previous studies. for the species we sampled, we adopted the widely accepted genus lymnaea for all species, except for galba truncatula, omphiscola glabra, pseudosuccinea columella and radix peregra .

dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction  amplification
total dna was isolated from the distal part of the foot. we carefully controlled for trematode presence during dissection in order to avoid exogen dna. extractions were performed using the dneasy blood and tissue kit  according to manufacturers' instructions. the two nuclear internal transcribed spacers  and the  <dig> s gene were amplified using published primers  <cit>  . pcr amplification was performed for each pair of primers in a total volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig> μl of pcr reaction buffer 5×,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> μm of each dntp,  <dig> pmol of each primer,  <dig> u gotaq dna polymerase , and  <dig> μl of dna template. temperature cycling for the its- <dig> and its- <dig> was as follows: 94°c for  <dig> min, 94°c for  <dig> sec, 50°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig> sec, repeated for  <dig> cycles, and final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. temperature cycling for the  <dig> s gene was 95°c for  <dig> min, 50°c for  <dig> min, 72°c for  <dig>  min, four times at 93°c for  <dig> sec, 50°c for  <dig> sec, 72°c for  <dig>  min and  <dig> times at 93°c for  <dig> sec,  <dig> sec at 50°c, 72°c for  <dig> min and final extension at 72°c for  <dig> min. the amplified products  were checked on 1% agarose gels in tae buffer. dna sequencing was performed by cogenics genome express  using pcr-amplified products as templates.

sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
we aligned its- <dig>  its- <dig> and  <dig> s sequences of  <dig> lymnaeid species and the three outgroups using prank v.  <dig>  <cit> . prank is based on an algorithm that can distinguish insertions from deletions and avoid repeated penalization of insertions. compared to clustal-w and muscle, it considerably improves the alignment quality especially in highly variable sequences such as itss. alignments of individual genes were concatenated in a supermatrix with the seqcat.pl v <dig>  script  <cit> .

two different approaches of tree reconstruction, maximum likelihood  and bayesian inference , were implemented. analyses were performed by partitioning the supermatrix on the basis of individual loci. ml analyses were conducted using the best-fitting model of sequence evolution. model selection was based on akaike's information criterion  using modeltest  <dig>   <cit> . ml trees and the corresponding bootstrap supporting values  of the nodes were obtained with paup*  <dig> b <dig>  <cit>  using heuristic search with neighbor-joining starting tree, tree bissection-reconnection swapping and  <dig> bootstrap replicates. bi analyses were performed with mrbayes  <dig>   <cit> . the tree space was explored using markov chain monte carlo  analyses with random starting trees, five simultaneous, sequentially heated independent chains sampled every  <dig> trees during five million generations. suboptimal trees were discarded once the "burn-in" phase was identified and a majority-rule consensus tree, with posterior probability support of nodes , was constructed with the remaining trees.

susceptibility to infection by fasciola hepatica and f. gigantica, and the evolution of the chromosome number in lymnaeidae
we searched available information on susceptibility to infection by f. hepatica and f. gigantica, derived from either analyses of natural populations or from experimental infections, in all species considered using the isi web of science . we recorded the susceptible or not susceptible status for each species . in addition, the haploid number of chromosomes  was obtained from previous publications  <cit> .

RESULTS
a comprehensive phylogeny of lymnaeidae
the ml and bi trees inferred with the alignment of the supermatrix including  <dig> lymnaeidae species and three outgroups  were extremely similar, although some node supports varied between the two approaches. the best model describing the evolution of the supermatrix was tvm+i+g . overall, the clades obtained here are consistent with previous results  <cit> . three deeply-rooted clades  were detected, basically matching the geographic origin of species . the c <dig> clade  included all american species and two species thought to originate from europe , although the inclusion of pseudosuccinea columella was only weakly supported . two highly supported subclades can be recognized within this clade. the first one  included the south american l. diaphana, the north american stagnicola caperata, the european l. occulta , and all other north american stagnicola. the second subclade  grouped the south american l. cousini with the north american fossaria obrussa and l. humilis, on the one hand, and the european g. truncatula, neotropical l. cubensis , l. neotropica and l. viatrix, the north american f. bulimoides and lymnaea sp. from colombia, on the other hand.

the c <dig> clade  consisted of exclusively eurasian species. in this clade, omphiscola glabra  first diverged from all other species, including most large-bodied species found in europe . this was followed by divergence of l. stagnalis, l. corvus , l. fuscus, stagnicola sp. eear-ukraine- <dig>  l. palustris  and s. turricola . these relationships are identical to those reported in  <cit> .

the c <dig> clade contained all australasian and radix species, including the african lymnaea  natalensis. ml and bi analyses indicated that there were two subclades within c <dig>  the first one  was formed by austropeplea lessoni and bullastra cumingiana , a. tomentosa and kutikina hispidina , and a subclade grouping a. ollula and a. viridis  , on the one hand; and lymnaea sp. eear-china- <dig> and lymnaea sp. eear-hawaii- <dig> , on the other hand. the second subclade  consisted of all radix species , including l.  natalensis, and included two monophyletic groups. the first one was formed by radix labiata sister to r. peregra, r. ampla and r. lagotis. note that our samples of r. peregra from southern france clustered within the motu <dig> clade described in  <cit>  with no ambiguity, based on analyses of coi and its- <dig> sequences . the second, more recently derived clade, was formed by r. auricularia and r. ovata which were sister to a clade comprising radix sp. eear-philippines- <dig>  radix sp. eear-canada- <dig> and radix sp. eear-romania- <dig>  l.  natalensis sister to r. luteola, and r. quadrasi sister to r. rubiginosa.

discussion
a comprehensive phylogeny of lymnaeidae
recent studies have suggested that the lymnaeidae contains approximately  <dig> species  <cit> , meaning that our phylogeny represents approximately half the existing diversity of the family. the tree presented in figure  <dig> indicates that species cluster by geographic origin in three deep clades. one is almost entirely composed of american species, while the two others are from the old world. the split between the american c <dig> clade and old world c <dig> clade probably dates back to the opening of the atlantic ocean 160- <dig> million years ago . this date is reasonable given the fossil record suggests the divergence of physidae-lymnaeidae took place near the jurassic period .

concerning the american clade  various aspects should be highlighted. our study is the first to include l. diaphana in a phylogenetic analysis and suggests that this species is sister to the north american stagnicola and l. occulta  , although with low support . baker  <cit>  reported l. diaphana in south dakota, consistent with a possible north american origin. however, the species was originally described from southern south america  and is currently found in argentina, brazil, chile, peru and uruguay. it could be either that the current distribution of l. diaphana in south america is not representative of its north american origin or that the ancestor of clade c1a was originally from south america and then migrated northwards, where it gave origin to the stagnicola of clade c1a. a further point is that l. occulta  from poland is unambiguously grouped with this clade and agrees with  <cit> . this is unexpected as this species is thought to originate from europe, and was formerly grouped, on the basis of anatomical characters, together with the european l. palustris  and s. turricola , which appear, as expected, in a predominantly european clade . we hypothesize that l. occulta was actually introduced in europe from north american populations . finally, our results do not contradict the hypothesis that s. emarginata, s. elodes and s. catascopium are conspecifics, as suggested by  <cit>  and  <cit> . if this is true, stagnicola sp. eear-manitoba- <dig> should also be synonymized with these three taxa.

species with similar shell morphology  in the c1b clade cluster together. the only exception is l. cousini which clearly belongs to this clade  but is morphologically different from all other species in terms of both shell morphology and the anatomy of reproductive organs. its phylogenetic position suggests the ancestor of clade c1b had a g. truncatula-like morphology and the l. cousini morphology is a derived character. the inclusion of g. truncatula within this clade is unambiguous and agrees with previous results  <cit> . this species has always been considered a native from the old world, occurring in europe, russia, and north africa, and to have been recently introduced to south america  <cit> . our phylogeny suggests that g. truncatula represents a branch of an american clade that reached the old world, where it has evolved and diverged from its american sister species . interestingly, lymnaea sp. from colombia, previously described as g. truncatula  <cit> , was unambiguously identified as a distinct taxonomic entity, yet to be sequenced. we currently lack sequences and population-genetic studies of several taxa described in north america presenting morphological similarities with lymnaea sp. therefore, we are not in position to ascertain that this is a new species and to determine whether it is endemic or has been introduced to south america. thus, we refrain from describing this entity as a new species to avoid adding more noise to the already confusing systematics of the lymnaeidae.

the second deep clade  consists exclusively of eurasian species, and species branching agrees  <cit>  and  <cit> . it does not contradict the hypothesis that l. palustris  and s. turricola  are synonymous, as proposed by  <cit> . these two taxa indeed only differ by two anatomical characters   <cit> .

the third deep clade  includes all species inhabiting australia and the indo-pacific region, as well as radix species. according to this tree, austropeplea is a polyphyletic genus, in agreement with results obtained by  <cit> ,  <cit>  and  <cit> . remigio  <cit>  suggested monophyly of autropeplea spp., bullastra cumingiana, lymnaea sp. eear-china- <dig> and lymnaea sp. eear-hawaii- <dig>  our results indicate that kutikina hispida and lymnaea gen. sp. from hawaii are also members of this clade. on the other hand, radix seems to be a monophyletic genus, in agreement with  <cit> ,  <cit> ,  <cit>  and  <cit> , but in contradiction with results of  <cit>  and  <cit> . importantly, l.  natalensis, the only known endemic african species, branched unambiguously within the radix clade, in agreement with  <cit> , sister to r. luteola from sri lanka. this result confirms that the name radix natalensis better reflects its phyletic relationships than does lymnaea natalensis. our results do not support the hypothesis that r. peregra and r. ovata are synonymous  <cit> . their synonymy is indeed still a controversial matter  <cit> . alternatively, r. peregra, r. ampla and r. lagotis are closely related taxa, in agreement with  <cit> , and might potentially be conspecifics, although confirmation using mating experiments seems necessary.

in summary  we have three old centers of diversification in the lymnaeidae family: america, eurasia and the indo-pacific region. in the latter, the radix clade diversified and then expanded towards eurasia and africa. this is also true of g. truncatula, a branch of the american clade that invaded the old world. in general, the lymnaeidae morphology has evolved slowly and most species within clades are similar: small-shelled turriform, g. truncatula-like in the american clade; large and high-spired shells in the eurasian lymnaea; and large, rounded or ovate shells in the indo-pacific clade, especially in radix. a few branches, including o. glabra, and l. cousini, have evolved distinctive morphologies that differ from all other lymnaeids. note, however, that limpet-shaped species  were not analyzed here, and it is not possible to discuss their phylogenetic position and morphological evolution. if they constitute a separate clade, say c <dig>  our hypothesis of slow morphological evolution would be valid.

concerning chromosome numbers,  <cit>  and  <cit>  hypothesized that evolution in lymnaeidae proceeded from low  to high  values. accordingly, austropeplea with  <dig> chromosome pairs was thought to be the most "primitive" form, followed by radix with  <dig> pairs and stagnicola with  <dig> pairs. our molecular phylogeny contradicts this idea. the ancestral state in lymnaeidae seems to be n =  <dig>  as it is in other basommatophoran gastropods   <cit> . eighteen pairs of chromosomes is likely to be a pleisomorphic character, in agreement with  <cit>  and  <cit> , and thus species of clades c3a  and c3b  would represent derived rather than ancestral states. remigio  <cit>  suggested that n =  <dig> evolved from n =  <dig>  our results do not contradict this idea, although it is difficult to infer the number of chromosomes for the ancestor of clade c <dig>  in addition, if lymnaea spp. from hawaii and china have indeed  <dig> chromosome pairs, as suggested by  <cit> , either a reversion from n =  <dig> to n =  <dig> or three independent evolutions to n =  <dig> would be required .

nomenclature in lymnaeidae
the nomenclature of genera has been one of the most confusing issues in the lymnaeidae systematics. most genus names are not fixed and are based more on phenotypic resemblances than on sound evolutionary and phylogenetic considerations. for instance, a single genus was recognized by  <cit> , two by  <cit> , and up to  <dig> genera by others  <cit> . our results indicate that genera in lymnaeidae do not reflect phylogenetic relationships, to the notable exception of radix  natalensis).

the type species of lymnaea is l. stagnalis linnaeus, 1758; the type species of stagnicola jeffreys,  <dig> is s. palustris ; and the type species of omphiscola rafinesque,  <dig> is o. glabra. however, it is clear from our results that these three species belong to the same clade  and that lymnaea is not a monophyletic group. we propose that species of clade c <dig> should all be called lymnaea, according to the principle of priority of the international code of zoological nomenclature . by extension, stagnicola should not be used to name species in clade c1a since the type species belongs to clade c <dig>  meier-brook and bargues  <cit>  suggested including s. emarginata, s. elodes, s. catascopium and l. occulta within a new genus catascopium, while s. caperata would belong to the genus hinkleyia baker,  <dig>  <cit> . our phylogeny does not conflict with this nomenclature, although it would seem preferable to identify all species of clade c1a with the same name to reflect the close evolutionary relationships among these species. hinkleyia would be the preferable name according to the iczn. on the other hand, at least four genera names have been used for species of clade c1b: lymnaea lamarck, 1799; galba schrank, 1803; fossaria westerlund, 1885; and bakerilymnaea. in the light of the present results, it would be preferable to unify nomenclature. according to the iczn, lymnaea should be the unified name, but given that the type species belongs to clade c <dig>  galba could be a more appropriate name. finally, as said above, austropeplea cotton,  <dig> is not a monophyletic group, and employing the genus kutikina ponder and waterhouse,  <dig>  seems unjustified on the basis of the current phylogeny. this would also be consistent with results of  <cit> . it would be preferable to use bullastra pfeiffer,  <dig> for all species of clade c3a to fit the iczn.

unravelling biological invasions of lymnaeidae using the phylogeny
although the lymnaeidae phylogeny presented in figure  <dig> matches reasonably well with the geographical origin of samples, some species clustered in clades with different geographic origins stand out and potentially correspond to biological invasions of a more or less recent origin. from an epidemiological standpoint, this is a key issue because some lymnaeid species are more susceptible than others to trematode infection, hence biological invasions can help explain the broad geographic distribution of fascioliasis and in determining the risks for veterinary and public health .

first, one of our most puzzling results concerns the origin of g. truncatula müller,  <dig>  the main vector of fascioliasis in the old world. the idea that this species is native to europe, as it was described from germany, is widely accepted  <cit> . however, a very different picture emerges from our phylogeny: it is the only european species branching with the wholly american clade c1b. this strongly suggests that america is where g. truncatula originated. this is consistent with its detection in alaska and the yukon territory  <cit> . it is possible the current distribution of g. truncatula in north america is broader, but has remained cryptic because it has been confounded with other taxa. indeed, hubendick noted that, "it is a matter of some doubt whether lymnaea humilis in north america is a distinct species or is specifically connected to l. truncatula"   <cit> . it could be that some populations of l. humilis in reality correspond to g. truncatula. at least  <dig> species of lymnaeidae from north america placed in synonymy of l. humilis by  <cit> , but considered as valid by  <cit> , present conchological similarities with g. truncatula: l. galbana say, 1825; l. modicella say, 1825; l. obrussa say, 1825; l. parva lea, 1841; l. exigua lea, 1841; l. rustica lea, 1841; l. tazevelliana wolf, 1869; l. dalli baker, 1906; l. cyclostoma walker, 1908; and l. peninsulae walker,  <dig>  unfortunately, neither detailed anatomical descriptions nor molecular data are available in any of these taxa. sampling and sequencing of morphologically similar north american taxa could shed light on this question.

second, as mentioned above, l. occulta  is the only species from europe clustering within clade c <dig> and seems to correspond to a passage from north america to europe. as stated by  <cit>  , l. occulta is distributed in eastern germany, poland, the former czechoslovakia, the former yugoslavia, ukraine, sweden, and some rivers in the delta of lake baikal. it is hypothesized that the species could reach the far east asia where it could have been confounded with other stagnicoline species because of similarity in shell morphology  <cit> . in any case, it seems clear that l. occulta has its origins in america.

finally, the two radix sp. are likely introductions originating from the indo-pacific area to canada and romania. the fact that these two sister taxa  are found in distant geographic locations is indicative of recent introductions.

the relationships between lymnaeidae and fasciola hepatica and f. gigantica
from an epidemiological standpoint, digenetic trematodes show marked specificity for their intermediate hosts but can infect a broad spectrum of definite hosts. usually, species are oioxenous  or stenoxenous   <cit> . this is because when the infectious form of the parasite  enters a snail, it must encounter an internal physiological and biochemical environment that supports its complete development. however, the case of f. hepatica seems to be different. our results show that lymnaeid species serving as intermediate hosts of this trematode are widely distributed across the phylogeny . basically, all clades contain species that have proven to be naturally or experimentally infected with this parasite. only a few species have been shown to be resistant to infection . in contrast, species involved in f. gigantica transmission are more clustered in the phylogeny . although not all species are equally susceptible to infection by f. hepatica, the broad capacity of this parasite to infect phylogenetically distant species is remarkable. the lymnaeidae-fasciola system differs from the well known planorbidae-schistosoma system, in which each trematode species infects a narrow group of hosts that share a close phylogenetic relationship  <cit> . the behavior of f. hepatica with respect to lymnaeidae is of paramount importance in epidemiology control programs: rather than focusing on a single, or a handful of snail species, fascioliasis control programs should cover a broader spectrum of intermediate hosts that inhabit diverse habitats and ecological conditions. our results confirm that the presence of f. hepatica in all continents is strongly favored by its capacity to infect local lymnaeids. based on these results, it seems that all geographic regions in the world are exposed to the epidemiological risk of fascioliasis.

CONCLUSIONS
at least four conclusions can be drawn from this study. first, combining information from different genes  is a robust approach to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the lymnaeidae. our results indicate that members of this family diverged in three deeply-rooted clades corresponding to the geographic origin of species . our phylogeny allowed us to pinpoint discordances between ancestral and current geographic distributions of some species, potentially indicating more or less recent biological invasions. transfers from america to eurasia are suggested for g. truncatula and l. occulta , as well as passages from the indo-pacific to europe and north america for radix sp. however, sampling and sequencing efforts remain to be done especially in the palaearctic and nearctic regions in which the family diversity is thought to be the largest. this would help resolve the weakly supported relationships , determine the pace of morphological evolution, establish taxonomic synonymy, and determine the phylogenetic relevance of poorly known genera . second, with the exception of radix  natalensis), genus names in lymnaeidae do not reflect the phyletic relationships among species. the group taxonomy should be reconsidered to gain some biological meaning. third, the number of chromosomes in lymnaeidae has evolved from an ancestral state of  <dig> pairs to a derived  <dig> and  <dig> pairs. finally, while the intermediate hosts of f. gigantica are basically restricted to clade c <dig>  f. hepatica is able to infect species from all main clades . this suggests that the cosmopolitan distribution of f. hepatica is largely favored by its capacity to infect local lymnaeids, and highlights the importance of the correct identification of intermediate-host species in fascioliasis control programs.
