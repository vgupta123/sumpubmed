BACKGROUND
newly born migrating neuroblasts usually have one neurite, which they use for active migration from the site of origin to their destination site. a complex activity of receptors, cell adhesion molecules as well as attractants and repellents modulate intracellular machinery regulating outgrowth of neurites.

many signaling molecules have been identified to be involved in neurite outgrowth, from membrane receptors to cytoskeleton constituents  <cit> . the tip of neurite, neural growth cone, is enriched in actin filaments as well as different filament remodeling and adapter proteins  <cit> . intracellular kinases, such as mapk, erk and pi3k, regulate formation of actin filaments while small gtpases link kinase signaling to actin cytoskeleton machinery  <cit> . distribution of different cell membrane and cytoplasm components determines the polarization of neuroblasts, and thus the directionality of migration  <cit> . much of the analysis of neurite outgrowth machinery has been done in rat embryonic hippocampal culture . however, analysis in other systems does not always correspond to hippocampal culture and sometimes are even in contradiction with the results obtained in hippocampal culture. for example, activation of small gtpase rac <dig> promotes neurite extension in rat hippocampal culture  <cit>  while its activation decreases the longest neurite length of rat cortical culture  <cit>  and its inhibition promotes neurite outgrowth in chick dorsal root ganglion neuronal culture  <cit> . also, while activation of pi3k-akt pathway in hippocampal culture induces neurite outgrowth  <cit> , stimulation of this pathway can inhibit neurite outgrowth or have no effect in neuronal-like pc <dig> cell line  <cit> . thus, intracellular signaling regulating neurite outgrowth varies among different neuronal cell types and has to be analyzed separately for each cell type.

the majority of neurons in mammalian brain are born and migrate to their destination site during embryonic development. there are, however, two postnatal brain regions that continue to produce neurons - subventricular zone of lateral ventricles  and subgranular zone of hippocampus  <cit> . postnatally generated svz neuroblasts migrate via the rostral migratory stream  to the olfactory bulb where they mature into distinct interneuron subtypes, namely granule and periglomerular cells. we recently described the generation of transgenic mice, in which egfp is expressed in the entire rms  <cit> , and optimized a procedure for rna isolation from in vivo fluorescent rms neuroblasts  <cit> . using transgenic mice with the clearly egfp labeled rms, we isolated neuroblasts from two distinct locations, one in the immediate vicinity of the svz , and the other more rostral, closer to the bulb   <cit> . we showed that the majority of upregulated genes and pathways in cells from the arms are involved in neuroblast migration. however, different genes/pathways can affect various cellular processes involved in neuroblast migration, e.g. we found that glua <dig>  probably modulates neuroblast polarization while vav <dig>  is needed for growth cone formation  <cit> .

using a neurite outgrowth culture assay, we analyzed several upregulated arms genes of the pi3k/akt1/pkcζ/rac1/cdc <dig> pathway to establish their role for neurite outgrowth of postnatally generated svz/rms neuroblasts. we found that activation of several proteins in this pathway enhanced neurite outgrowth while their inhibition decreased outgrowth. pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ acted upstream of the small gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  which in turn modulate lamellipodia formation and neurite elongation.

RESULTS
development of morphological neuronal characteristics for postnatal svz/rms culture
we first established the development of different morphological characteristics in postnatal svz/rms culture . at day  <dig> in vitro , 70% of neurons already have one small neurite  and at div <dig> many of them have  <dig>  or  <dig>  short neurites . thus, the initial neurite outgrowth for postnatal svz/rms cultured neurons starts during the first day in culture and by the third day all neurons have at least  <dig> neurite. at div <dig>  90% of neurons have  <dig> or more neurites , but all neurites of the cell are approximately of the same length, indicating that neurons are not polarized yet. at div <dig> and div <dig>  60% of neurons are polarized, i.e. have one major neurite longer than other neurites . for analysis of polarization, it was not possible to use the standard dendritic and axonal markers map <dig> and tau, respectively, . whilst most neurites exhibited map <dig> expression, only few polarized neurons  were found to express tau in their major neurite. this is not surprising, as it was shown that the major cell-type generated in the postnatal svz  develop an axonless phenotype upon maturation  <cit> .

neurite outgrowth analysis of svz/rms-derived neurons following pharmacological treatment
we analyzed the involvement of different intracellular signaling molecules in neurite outgrowth of svz/rms neuroblasts using protein inhibitors. for the analysis we chose  <dig> intracellular signaling molecules that are involved in neurite outgrowth/polarization of rat embryonic hippocampal cultures pi3k, akt <dig>  pkcζ, rac <dig>  cdc <dig>  <cit> . most of these genes are expressed in the postnatal svz and rms at high levels and continue to be expressed in olfactory bulb according to the allen brain atlas  <cit>  . expression of these genes in rms was also shown in our previous microarray study  <cit> .

dissociated svz/rms neurons were cultured for one or four days in the presence or absence of different protein inhibitors following by fixation and staining with anti-tuj <dig>  antibodies . to be able to make correlations between the results obtained at div <dig> and div <dig>  we used the length of the major neurite to assess neurite outgrowth, since at div <dig> the majority of neurons have only one neurite . inhibitors of pi3k , akt <dig>  and pkcζ  as well as small gtpase inhibitors  significantly decreased neurite outgrowth after one day  . as vehicle we used dmso. the inhibition of neurite outgrowth was more pronounced after four days of treatment  . total neurite length was also decreased at div <dig> while the number of neurites was not changed . pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ inhibitors had the strongest effect on neurite outgrowth. in fact, in dissociated cultures, svz/rms neurons treated with low concentrations of pkcζ inhibitor  failed to grow neurites longer than the cell body . none of the inhibitors affected the initial neurite formation , except of pkcζ inhibitor . many neurons still lacked a neurite even at div <dig> in pkcζ inhibitor-treated cultures . previously, pkcζ was shown to be involved in polarization, but not in neurite outgrowth of hippocampal culture neurons  <cit> . our results possibly reveal a novel effect of pkcζ, demonstrating that in svz/rms neurons pkcζ is not only important for cell polarization but also for neurite protrusion. the concentrations of the inhibitors used in the study did not decrease cell adhesion  and did not increase apoptosis following one- or four-day treatment in culture .

treatment with raf <dig> inhibitor or rapamycin  did not influence neurite outgrowth .

neurite outgrowth analysis of svz/rms-derived neurons following genetic manipulations
to strengthen the evidence for the involvement in neurite outgrowth of the intracellular molecules analyzed by protein inhibitors, we performed overexpression studies in dissociated svz/rms neuronal cultures. cultures were co-transfected with individual gene-expressing constructs together with an egfp-expressing construct using lipofectamine  <dig> hours after plating, and the total length of green fluorescent cell neurites was measured  <dig>  days after transfection . here we used the total length of neurites to assess neurite outgrowth, since after transfection with some overexpression constructs , neurites grow in all directions. thus, "total neurite length" is a more appropriate parameter than "major neurite length" to evaluate neurite outgrowth in transfection experiments. as a control we used pcmv-sport <dig> plasmid. transfection with constitutively active cdc <dig> and rac <dig> expression constructs increased the total neurite length while inactive cdc <dig> and rac <dig> mutants decreased it  . transfection with the activated akt <dig> expression construct as well as with full-length pkcζ and pik3r <dig> expression constructs also significantly  increased neurite length . since overexpression studies were started at div <dig> while pharmacological studies at div <dig>  they could affect cultures at different stages of maturation and, thus, have a slightly different effect. however, till div <dig> morphological changes in svz/rms cultures were very subtle and noticeable neurite growth and development of polarization started between div <dig> and div <dig> . hence, we believe that overexpression studies support the conclusions derived from the results obtained in pharmacological experiments.

involvement of small gtpase activation for neurite outgrowth of svz/rms-derived neurons
since activation of small gtpases modulates neurite outgrowth in different neuronal culture systems , we tested the effect of pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ inhibitors on the activation of gtpase rac <dig> and cdc <dig> in dissociated svz/rms neuronal cultures. following experiments were carried out in duplicates. cultures were grown for  <dig> days in normal media followed by an additional culture day in the presence of pi3k, akt <dig> or pkcζ inhibitors. there was a  <dig> ,  <dig> and 6-fold decrease of rac1-gtp  in pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ inhibitor-treated cells, respectively . furthermore, application of pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ inhibitors also decreased the amount of cdc42-gtp  up to  <dig>   <dig>  and 20-fold, respectively .

phosphatidylinositols are involved in the polarization of svz/rms-derived neurons
in culture, neuronal polarization occurs in several stages: extension of several undifferentiated neurites occurs after a few days followed by the more rapid growth of one neurite destined to become the axon  and the concomitant shortening of the neurites developing into dendrites  <cit> . neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neuronal culture is known to be determined at least in part by the specific distribution of phosphatidylinositols  on the cell membrane, and accumulation of pip--p <dig>  at the tip of neurites is important for their elongation  <cit> . thus, we applied different pips - namely, pip <dig> , <dig>  pip--p <dig>  and pip--p <dig>  - to dissociated svz/rms neuronal cultures, and after  <dig> days of incubation we analyzed neuron polarization by staining with tuj <dig> . treatment with any of the tested pips caused a reduction  in the number of neurons having only one long neurite , whilst the total neurite length and neurite branching remained unchanged.

small gtpases are involved in lamellipodia formation of svz/rms-derived neurons
an essential step in cell migration is lamellipodia propagation. it was shown for different cell types that the small gtpases cdc <dig>  rac <dig> and rho are involved in lamellipodia propagation by affecting/regulating actin scaffold proteins - wasp/wave  <cit> . we tested the influence of rac <dig> inhibitor as well as c. difficile protein toxin a, an inhibitor of rho family small gtpases  on lamellipodia formation around the neuronal cell body and the main neurite of svz/rms neurons. we found that rac <dig> inhibitor significantly decreased the number of neurons with large lamellipodia whereas toxin a increased it . the effect of rac <dig> on lamellipodia formation most likely involves the activation of actin scaffold protein wave <dig>  as previously suggested  <cit> .

discussion
in vitro neurite outgrowth studies have frequently employed rat embryonic hippocampal cultures . however, in other culture systems results do not always correspond to those obtained in hippocampal culture. for instance, in contrast to hippocampal cultures, activation of the small gtpase rac <dig> decreases the length of the longest neurite in rat cortical cultures  <cit>  and its inhibition promotes neurite outgrowth in chick dorsal root ganglion neuronal cultures  <cit> . also, stimulation of the pi3k/akt pathway inhibits neurite outgrowth in neuronal-like pc <dig> cell line  <cit> , whereas activation of this pathway in hippocampal cultures enhances neurite outgrowth  <cit> . our work is the first study investigating neurite outgrowth in postnatally generated neurons. although the results described here indicate that by and large the signaling pathway for neurite outgrowth in cultured postnatally born svz/rms neurons is similar to that reported for rat hippocampal cultures or other neuronal cultures, there are some features that are specific for svz/rms neuroblasts . pkcζ was previously shown to be involved in the regulation of neuronal polarization of several neuronal cell types in culture . however, treatment of svz/rms culture with specific pkcζ inhibitor completely abolished neurite outgrowth - both, at div <dig> and div <dig> only few neurons had visible neurites. since the decrease in neurite length is dramatic already at div <dig> when neurons are not polarized yet, we attribute the effect of pkcζ inhibitor treatment to an impairment of neurite outgrowth. even very low doses of the pkcζ inhibitor  abrogated neurite outgrowth of svz/rms neurons. although much higher concentration of pkcζ inhibitor  also decreased neurite length in rat hippocampal  <cit>  and enteric  <cit>  neuronal cultures, the effect was attributed specifically to an impairment in neuronal polarization, rather than neurite outgrowth.

inhibition of pkcζ caused a stronger reduction in rac <dig> and cdc <dig> activation than inhibition of pi3k or akt <dig> . this may be indicative of pkcζ acting downstream of pi3k and/or akt <dig>  the interaction of pkcζ with cdc <dig> and rac <dig> has been shown before  <cit> , but differently from our results, cdc <dig> and rac <dig> acted upstream of pkcζ. in svz/rms cultured neurons pkcζ can be envisaged to stabilize activated  forms of rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  activation of both rac <dig> and cdc <dig> depended on pi3k/akt <dig> activity . pi3k inhibitor reduced cdc <dig> activation more than the akt <dig> inhibitor, while reduction in gtp-bound rac <dig> was stronger after application of the akt <dig> inhibitor than the pi3k inhibitor. a possible scenario accounting for this findings may be that cdc <dig> is activated downstream of pip <dig> via pkcζ signaling, whilst activation of rac <dig> involves a stronger recruitment of akt <dig> . however, further experiments are required to directly prove the proposed model shown in figure  <dig>  thus, it remains to be established whether activated versions of rac <dig> and cdc <dig> can rescue the phenotype caused by pi3k, akt <dig> or pkcζ inhibitor. conversely, activated forms of pi3k/akt1/pkcζ should not have an effect on neurite outgrowth upon cdc <dig> and rac <dig> inhibition according to this model.

pi3k and akt <dig> have been shown to be involved in neurite outgrowth in primary cultured neurons  <cit> . in hippocampal cultures, the accumulation of pip <dig> , <dig>  the main enzymatic product of pi3k, specifies the future axon. pip <dig> , <dig> is required for axon elongation, and the specific distribution of pips in developing neurons is necessary for neuronal polarization  <cit> . also for postnatal svz-derived neurons pi3k and akt <dig> are required for neurite elongation as demonstrated in this study. however, affecting pip <dig> , <dig> distribution on cell membrane did not modify significantly neurite outgrowth while disturbing neuronal polarization. we hypothesize that for postnatal svz/rms neurons pi3k activity is more important for neurite outgrowth while overall pip distribution  is more important for neuronal polarization.

in contrast to the phenotype of postnatally generated dentate gyrus granule cells that grow dendrites and axons upon maturation, the majority of svz-generated neurons develop into axonless cells  <cit> . indeed, we found that only few polarized neurons exhibited tau expression . the results were confirmed using anti-tau antibodies from different suppliers. we propose that the longest neurite of the polarized neurons in svz/rms cultures corresponds to the major dendrite of granule cells, the main subtype of neurons produced in the svz  <cit> .

in our lamellipodia analysis experiments we found that c. difficile protein toxin a treatment resulted in formation of large lamellipodia around cell bodies of the neurons. toxin a inhibits the activity not only of lamellipodia-regulating small gtpases, but also of the small gtpase rho that stabilizes focal adhesion  <cit> . the observed phenotype could be the consequence of rho inhibition that impaired the stabilization of focal adhesion and, as a result, promoted the formation of large lamellipodia.

it will be interesting to see whether other intracellular molecules that were shown to be involved in neurite outgrowth of postnatally born svz neurons can also modify pi3k/akt1/pkcζ/rac1/cdc <dig> pathway signaling. one prominent candidate is pten, which negatively regulates pip <dig> generation and pi3k signaling, thus, inhibiting neuronal polarization  <cit> . since we showed the importance of pip distribution for polarization of the svz/rms neurons in vitro, the balance between pten/pi3k signaling may be important for proper neurite development. another potentially interesting candidate is gsk3beta that was shown to inhibit axonal formation  <cit> . pi3k/akt1/pkcζ/rac1/cdc <dig> pathway signaling may be also affected by some extracellular cues such as trophic factors and repellents/attractants. for instance, semaphorin  <cit>  and netrin  <cit>  signaling affect neurite outgrowth in vivo, and bdnf was shown to promote axonal differentiation in vitro via lkb1/strad  <cit> .

neurite outgrowth is a fundamental neuronal feature and plays an important role in neuronal development during embryogenesis and in the adult brain. although in general the machinery for neurite outgrowth has many common constituents when comparing various neuronal cell types, there are differences as shown here that need to be studied to better understand neuronal functions at the cellular level.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we analyzed intracellular signaling constituents involved in neurite outgrowth of postnatally born svz neurons. we showed that inhibition of pi3k, akt <dig>  pkcζ and small gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig> decreased neurite outgrowth. since inhibition of pi3k, akt <dig> and pkcζ resulted in a reduction of activated forms of rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  we propose a model according to which the pi3k/akt1/pkcζ cascade leads to the activation of the small gtpases rac <dig> and cdc <dig>  thereby modulating the cytoskeleton machinery during neurite outgrowth .
