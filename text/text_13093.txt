BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum is the taxonomic designation for at least six diverse species that produce botulinum neurotoxins . this heterologous species is further classified into six metabolically distinct groups . the groups include the toxin-forming strains of c. botulinum, c. butyricum, c. baratii, and c. argentinense  <cit> . c. botulinum is a spore-forming anaerobic bacteria which produces toxins that are lethal to humans and animals, and are classified as category a bioterrorism agents  <cit> . bonts target the soluble nsf attachment protein receptors  complex of proteins in the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, preventing acetylcholine from being released causing botulism   <cit> . seven immunologically distinct bont serotypes  have been described  <cit> .

botulinum neurotoxin g  is the least studied of the seven serotypes. bont/g-producing organisms were first isolated by gimenez and ciccarelli in  <dig> from soil samples taken from a cornfield in the mendoza province of argentina  <cit> . the investigators indicated that a novel strain of bacterium produced an antigenically specific, heat-labile botulinum-like toxin that was not neutralized by any of the known botulinum antisera. the antitoxin developed using this strain only neutralized its homologous toxin and showed no activity on any of the other known types of bont  <cit> . overall, nine strains of type g producing organisms have been isolated, two from argentina and seven from switzerland; none of which have ever been clearly implicated as the cause of paralytic illness or death in humans or animals  <cit> .

type g organisms are historically associated with the c. botulinum species, because of their ability to produce botulinum neurotoxin  <cit> . however, it is well known that botulinal toxin production is a poor parameter on which to base species identification and that the c. botulinum species is a taxonomic collection of several distinct species  <cit> . type/g producing organisms are classified as clostridium argentinense  <cit> . this species includes  <dig> strains of bacteria from the genus clostridium: nine toxigenic strains and three non-toxigenic strains. these strains are genetically and phenotypically distinct from all other strains of c. botulinum and other clostridial species  <cit> .

two of the three non-toxigenic strains were once classified as c. subterminale, and the third as c. hastiforme. these strains were often reported to cause serological cross-reactions with type/g producing organisms and the bont/g protein in elisa and fluorescence resonance energy transfer  detection assays  <cit> . the c. argentinense species can be distinguished from other asaccharolytic, proteolytic clostridia by a biochemical test that detects the production of a unique derivative of indole  <cit> . however, to avoid confusion among the medical and scientific communities, c. argentinense type/g producing organisms are still referred to as c. botulinum type/g  <cit> .

type/g toxin is produced in culture as a relatively large protein complex  consisting of a neurotoxin  and three neurotoxin-associated proteins : two hemagglutinins  and a nontoxic-nonhemagglutinin  component. in addition, there is a gene expression protein  that is responsible for regulating the expression of the four complex proteins. p <dig>  however, is not associated with the toxin complex itself  <cit> . the function of the naps has been shown to protect the neurotoxin in harsh environments in order to allow the toxin to enter the synaptic membrane. once inside the vesicle, the toxin can cleave its specific snare complex protein  <cit> . bont/g is known to cleave the synaptobrevin protein  in the snare complex . it is the only toxin known to cleave at a single ala81-ala <dig> peptide bond  <cit>  .

the predicted cleavage products and the masses of the substrate and product peptides for both/b and/g are shown. the substrate peptide was derived from the human synaptobrevin- <dig>  protein. note that/b and/g cleave  <dig> amino acids apart.

type/g-forming organisms have a relatively low toxigenicity, producing only small amounts of toxin in culture. this characteristic makes it difficult to identify type/g organisms in the presence of other species  <cit> . the toxin requires tryptic activation to be successfully detected in vitro; this requirement is also associated with toxins produced by non-proteolytic types/b and/f, as well as all strains of type/e  <cit> . regardless of bont/g's low toxigenicity in vitro, rhesus monkeys, chickens, and guinea pigs have demonstrated susceptibility to non-activated toxin when bont/g has been administered by various routes  <cit> . in addition, it has been reported that the ability to produce bont/g can be lost from toxigenic strains after several culture passages  <cit> . the loss is thought to occur because the complete nucleotide sequence of the bont/g gene, and the naps, are found on a 81-mda plasmid and not on the chromosome  <cit>  . of the seven serotypes, the bont/g nucleotide sequence has the most similarity to that of bont/b, as previously described  <cit> .

although bont/g is the least studied serotype of c. botulinum, previous reports have described a digestion method, two protein detection assays, and an activity detection assay. hines et al. were the first to apply a proteomics approach for bont/g. the authors used a 16-hour digestion method, followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography  coupled to mass spectrometry . the method returned limited recovery of peptides and protein sequence coverage. however, it provided enough information to distinguish the proteins associated with the bont/g complex  <cit> . glasby and hatheway described the potential use of fluorescent-antibody reagents to identify c. botulinum type/g producing strains, but they encountered cross-reactivity issues with similar species of non-toxigenic clostridia  <cit> . lewis et al. reported an elisa bont/g protein detection assay that was able to detect low concentrations of the bont/g proteins. the assay, however, also suffered from issues of cross-reactivity with similar non-toxigenic clostridium species  <cit> . finally, we have previously described a mass spectrometry-based activity detection assay, the endopep-ms method, which was developed to detect the activity of bonts in vitro against toxin-specific substrate peptides. this method was successful at detecting all seven bont serotypes  <cit> .

proteomics has been used to study changes after treatment with bont/a on suprachiasmatic nucleus  <cit> , on the thyroarytenoid muscle  <cit> , and of c <dig> exoenzyme from c. botulinum  <cit> , but there are very few reports on the bont proteome. in the present report, we detail proteomics methods that were successfully applied to the analysis of bont/g complex and thus further the understanding of the serotype. we confirmed the detection of toxin activity by use of the endopep-ms method. the application of a rapid digestion method, coupled with nano ultra-pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry , was successful at obtaining a greater percentage of amino acid sequence coverage of each protein associated with the/g complex than was previously reported. in addition, we describe the characterization and relative quantification of the proteins present in the/g complex. we also compare bont/g to other bont serotypes and discuss the previous literature reports to provide a complete description of the bont/g complex.

RESULTS
amino acid sequence comparisons confirmed bont/g and/b similarity
phenetic analysis of the seven available toxin sequences compared revealed that bont/g was the most similar to the bont/b okra and the least similar to bont/c stockholm, with a  <dig> % and a  <dig> % sequence similarity, respectively . to determine the extent to which the/g sequence is shared among toxins in the/b family,/g was compared with  <dig> different/b strains, including subtypes of/b <dig> /b <dig> /b <dig>  bivalent , and non-proteolytic/b . of the  <dig> sequences,/g shared the most sequence homology with the/b <dig> prevot  <dig> ncase strain, with an overall  <dig> % sequence similarity . in a focused look at the similarities between/g and the/b <dig> strain, the individual domains of the toxin proteins were compared. the percent similarity returned for each domain were as follows: peptidase   <dig> %, translocation   <dig> %, binding n-terminal    <dig> %, and binding c-terminal    <dig> % . additional comparison of bont/g naps with the naps of the other six serotypes indicated that not only is the type/g toxin sequence the most similar to/b, but the naps sequences for both serotypes do as well. the percent similarity returned for the naps were as follows: ntnh  <dig> %, ha <dig>  <dig> % and ha <dig>  <dig> % .

gel lc-ms/ms analysis identified the four main proteins within the bont complex
six of the  <dig> gel slices, tryptically digested overnight and analyzed by use of nlc-ms/ms, returned protein matches with high sequence coverage and a 99% identity confidence when searched by use of plgs v <dig>  and validated with scaffold v <dig> . the four main proteins associated with the botulinum neurotoxin complex were identified in various bands from the gel: bont/g, ntnh, ha <dig>  and ha <dig> .

in solution tryptic digestion analysis improved protein sequence coverage
the results of the six digests of bont/g from both analytical instruments  were compiled to determine the greatest percent of sequence coverage of each protein identified: bont/g , ntnh , ha <dig> , and ha <dig>  . the percent recovery was determined by combining all unique peptides identified by both nlc-ms/ms instruments and calculating the ratio of amino acids identified vs. total amino acids in the protein sequence.

endopep-ms analysis confirmed toxin activity
the results of the endopep-ms experiments conducted through use of various dilutions of bont/g indicated that the optimum temperature for/g activity is 42°c, not 37°c as observed with other bont serotypes. additionally, the experiments indicated that the toxin is the most active, or best activated, when first exposed to a short  <dig> min pulse at 47°c and then continuously incubated at 42°c for  <dig> hrs. the detection of the  <dig> m/z  and  <dig> m/z  product ions in each experiment confirmed that the lots of commercial toxin used were active.

relative quantification of type g toxin and naps was determined by use of mse
label-free relative protein quantification was obtained for each component of the type g toxin complex . when calculated by weight, the bont/g complex contained 30% of toxin, 38% of ntnh, 28% of ha <dig>  and 4% of ha <dig>  these percentages and nanogram amounts indicate that the overall weight ratio of bont:naps present within the complex is 1: <dig>  the percentages of each molecule present in the complex are as follows:  <dig> % of toxin,  <dig> % of ntnh,  <dig> % ha <dig>  and  <dig> % ha <dig>  these percentages and femtomole amounts indicate a 1:1:2: <dig> bont:ntnh:ha70:ha <dig> ratio, or a 1: <dig> bont:naps ratio, of molecules within the complex.

the proteins identified in the/g complex, ncbi accession numbers, and average masses are shown, in addition to the calculated amounts on column, femtomoles and nanograms, and the percent of each protein, by weight and molarity, within the bont complex.

discussion
bont/g is the least-studied and the most recently reported of the seven serotypes produced by c. botulinum. although bont/g is associated with a distinct species and metabolic group, the toxin shares multiple characteristics with the other six progenitor toxins. the seven serotypes have similar biochemical and molecular mechanisms of cell entry and membrane translocation. they cause disease by inhibiting synaptic transmission as a result of the enzymatic cleavage of the snare protein complex. in the present work, we detail the in silico comparison of bont/g progenitor toxin proteins to the other six serotypes of c. botulinum, as well as methods for the digestion, detection, and relative quantification of bont/g and its naps.

the comparison of the bont/g progenitor toxin with the other six serotypes was completed to determine/g's phenotypic relationship with the other bonts. in general, past analyses  <cit>  have included a comparison at the gene level; this study focuses solely on protein level. while comparisons of toxin and ntnh proteins to select serotypes have been previously described  <cit> , a complete comparison of all/g complex proteins  with the other six serotypes has not been previously reported. phenetic analysis confirmed that the bont/g complex of proteins shared the most similarity with the/b serotype , as previously reported  <cit> .

to determine the extent of/g's homology to the/b toxin serotype, we completed an in-depth comparison of six/b subtypes,  <dig> different accession numbers . the comparison of individual domains--translocation domain, binding domain nt, binding domain ct, and peptidase--revealed the area of the toxin in which/g shares the greatest  and least  similarity. overall, each domain compared, between the two toxins, is greater than 50% similar. this comparison helped to determine which substrate peptide would be optimal to test the activity of/g. although there are no direct indications that sequence similarity would imply overall identical functionality, similar sequences would allow similar crystal structures to form, suggesting similar functionality  <cit> . it is currently known that both bont/b and/g cleave the synaptobrevin protein;/b cleaves a gln76-phe <dig> bond and/g an ala81-ala <dig> bond five amino acids downstream . because the cleavage sites of both toxins are relatively near one another--thus the similarity of their binding domain sequences and therefore structures--the same peptide substrate currently used to test/b activity was used to test/g activity  <cit> .

in order to confirm that the commercial bont/g complex was active and therefore could be considered analogous to the toxin complex found in clinical samples, various dilutions of the commercial toxin were tested using the endopep-ms method previously described   <cit> . in addition to confirming the toxin's activity, the endopep-ms experiments indicated a new optimum temperature for/g activity. when reactions were pulsed at 47°c for  <dig> min, followed by incubation at 42°c for at least eight hours--as opposed to 37°c for a minimum of  <dig> hr--an increase in activity and in the quality of mass spectra produced was observed. other serotypes of bont  are often associated with botulism in animals, avians, equines, and bovines, whose body temperatures are higher than those of humans. bont/g has yet to be associated with botulism in a particular organism; however, it is possible that/g would be more effective at causing disease in an organism with a higher body temperature than that of humans, similar to bont/c and/d.

proteomic strategies and analyses used in this study were important to help define the characteristics of proteins associated with the bont/g complex. the 1d-sds page analysis confirmed the presence of the four expected complex proteins , with relatively high sequence coverage for in gel digestion . as expected the proteins, p <dig> and ha <dig>  were not identified. p <dig>  a positive regulator of gene expression, lies just upstream of ntnh on the toxin plasmid   <cit> . the purpose of p <dig>  in complex development, is not completely understood and previous reports have not identified it as part of the/g complex  <cit> . ha <dig>  a hemagglutinin component, is not found on the/g plasmid. the lack of evidence of the protein's presence further endorsed the theory that, unlike the other serotypes, ha <dig> is not associated with the/g complex  <cit> . two gel slices  out of  <dig> visually had protein but did not return any identifiable peptides when digested and analyzed. this could be due to a number of factors: the protein was relatively difficult to digest, there was not a sufficient amount of protein to digest, the sequence was not present in the database used, or post-translational modifications  altered the protein sequence and did not allow for identification. the sds-page gel and in gel digestions confirmed visually and analytically which proteins are present in the commercial toxin complex and allowed us to continue to in solution digestions with some prior knowledge of which proteins should be identified.

as anticipated, the same proteins that were identified with the in gel digestions were also identified in the analysis of the in solution digestions. the four main complex components-- bont, ntnh, ha <dig>  and ha17--were all identified with high confidence, and returned a large number of peptides. hines et al. reported the use of a reduction and alkylation overnight digestion method that produced sequence coverages of 16% for bont, 10% for ntnh, 38% for ha <dig>  and 49% for ha <dig>  <cit> . the method used in our study allowed the recovery of more than four times the sequence coverage for bont at 66%, more than five times for ntnh at 57%, and more than double for both ha <dig> and ha <dig> at 91% and 99%, respectively.

bont complexes are difficult to digest in solution  <cit> . this rapid high-temperature digestion method does not involve reduction and alkylation, unlike classical methods; instead, it uses an acid labile surfactant to solubilize the hydrophobic proteins. the increased solubility allows a denatured protein to be more susceptible to tryptic digestion, thereby increasing the rate of digestion and the number of tryptic peptides produced  <cit> . it has also been previously reported that the use of high temperature for a short period of time is the best condition for the enzymatic activity of trypsin  <cit> .

this bont complex digestion method, in addition to analysis of the samples on two different electrospray  ms instruments using data-dependent  and data-independent mse analysis, allowed for the detection of a greater number of peptides for each protein, leading to a greater overall sequence coverage than had previously been reported. this sequence coverage lends insight into the complex proteins being studied. a high percentage of sequence coverage indicates that there are few ptms associated with the proteins, as well as no truncation. the presence of ptms has been known to compromise protein identification, and truncated proteins do not function as expected.

in addition to providing enhanced sequence coverage, the use of data-independent mse analysis and label-free quantification software allowed us to relatively quantify the amount of each protein present in the bont/g complex . this quantification method has the advantage of being able to provide accurate estimates of relative protein abundance  of each protein within the complex was determined, as well as an overall weight ratio of bont:naps and a molecular ratio of bont:ntnh:ha70:ha <dig>  analysis of the individual proteins within the complex illustrated that the weight of the toxin  is almost equivalent to that of ha <dig>  and about eight percent less than that of ntnh ; whereas ha <dig> makes up only a minute portion of the overall weight at just  <dig> %. conversely, analysis using molecular amounts indicated that the complex contains an equivalent amount of the toxin, ntnh, and ha <dig>  whereas ha <dig> is almost twice as abundant. the nanogram and femtomole on column data sets signify a likely overall ratio of 1: <dig> bont:naps weight ratio and a 1:1:2: <dig> bont:ntnh:ha70:ha <dig> molar ratio. as stated earlier, the function of the naps has been shown to protect the neurotoxin in harsh environments  <cit> . due to this protective ability, in theory, a larger ratio of naps:bont, ie the greater the number of molecules of naps to bont, would protect more effectively the toxin from the acidic environment of the stomach. this potentially would increase the toxin's effectiveness at penetrating the mucosa of the intestine and entering the blood stream, increasing the toxin's chances of entering the synaptic cell and causing disease. knowledge of the stoichiometry of proteins within the bont complexes would be useful to further understanding of naps significance and toxin potency.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a detailed in silico comparison of the/g complex of proteins to the other six serotypes in an effort to compare, contrast, and further define the complex's relationship relative to the/b serotype and subtypes within the botulinum toxins. proteomic analyses, consisting of gel electrophoresis, in gel and in solution digestions, and endopep-ms, confirmed the presence of bont, ntnh, ha <dig>  and ha <dig> proteins and the activity of the commercial/g complex. we were successful at obtaining high sequence coverage for all four complex proteins by using a rapid, high-temperature digestion method and analysing with two different nlc-ms/ms instruments. the efficiency of this method allowed for a greater recovery of protein sequence and further insight into the complex proteins. the use of data-independent mse data analysis coupled to label-free quantification software suggested that relative quantification of the proteins within bont progenitor toxins could be determined and would be very informative to further analysis of c. botulinum potency.
