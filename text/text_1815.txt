BACKGROUND
splicing of primary transcripts is an essential step in the expression of many eukaryotic protein-coding genes. during splicing, non-coding intervening sequences  are excised from a precursor  mrna and neighboring coding regions  are ligated via two consecutive transesterification reactions  <cit> . pre-mrna splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a highly dynamic, multi-megadalton molecular ribonucleoprotein  machine that is composed of five small nuclear  rnps and numerous non-snrnp proteins  <cit> . for each round of splicing, a spliceosome is assembled in a stepwise fashion. the vast majority of splicing events in saccharomyces cerevisiae  is constitutive and involves assembly of a spliceosome across an intron. in a constitutive splice event, u <dig> and u <dig> snrnps recognize the 5’-splice site and branch point sequence of an intron, respectively, forming the a complex. subsequently, the u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnps join as a pre-formed tri-snrnp, giving rise to the pre-catalytic b complex. the b complex is then catalytically activated, yielding first the bact and subsequently the b* complex. the latter can carry out the first transesterification reaction of a splicing event. after step one of splicing, further rearrangements give rise to the c complex, which catalyzes the second transesterification reaction, subsequent to which the spliceosome is disassembled and subunits are recycled  <cit> .

most primary transcripts in complex, multicellular eukaryotes contain more than one intron and can undergo alternative splicing to yield multiple mature mrnas originating from the same gene  <cit> . the lengths of their introns vary considerably and can amount to several hundreds of thousands of nucleotides  <cit> , while their exons are on average much shorter  and more homogeneous in size  <cit> . therefore, faithful localization of authentic 5’- and 3’-splice sites in complex, multicellular organisms is thought to occur via the initial assembly of spliceosomal complexes across exons , which commits the pre-mrna to the splicing pathway . to allow intron excision, the interactions established during exon definition have to be reorganized to allow a 3’-splice site to be paired with an upstream 5’-splice site. exon definition may proceed either to a cross-intron a complex  <cit>  or directly to a cross-intron b complex under omission of a cross-intron a stage  <cit> . functional pairing of specific splice sites, and thus the decision on a certain splicing pattern, is thought to take place during this conversion of cross-exon to cross-intron spliceosomal complexes .

in yeast, pre-mrna processing factor  <dig> domain containing protein  and 23 kda small nuclear ribonucleoprotein component  are integral components of the u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp  <cit> , stay associated during tri-snrnp integration and b complex formation and leave the spliceosome again during the transition to the bact complex  <cit> . the human orthologs of prp <dig> and snu <dig> are also exclusively present at the b complex stage but, in contrast to their yeast orthologs, associate with the pre-catalytic spliceosome independent of the tri-snrnp  <cit> . this feature they share with seven other non-snrnp proteins, collectively referred to as b-specific proteins. the specific recruitment of b-specific proteins to the spliceosome during cross-exon to cross-intron switching makes them prime candidates as regulators of alternative splicing.

indeed, for most b-specific proteins there is evidence that they play a role in alternative splicing. in human, the group of b-specific proteins includes prp <dig>  snu <dig>  microfibrillar-associated protein  <dig> , suppressor of mec- <dig> and unc- <dig> protein homolog  <dig> , arg-glu/asp-repeat-containing protein , formin-binding protein  <dig> , 38 kda nuclear protein containing a ww domain , npw38-binding protein  and ubiquitin-like protein  <dig>   <cit> . homo sapiens  prp <dig> has acquired a veritable, c-terminal arginine-serine-rich  domain, a hallmark of the splicing regulatory serine-arginine-rich  proteins that are largely lacking in yeast  <cit> . ubl <dig>  also called hub <dig>  was the first splicing factor that was found to be involved in alterative splicing in human  <cit>  as well as in a rare case of alternative splicing in yeast  <cit> . in contrast, mfap <dig>  smu <dig>  red, fbp <dig>  npw <dig> and npw38bp lack obvious orthologs in yeast, where alternative splicing is essentially absent. mfap <dig>  smu <dig> and red have been implicated directly in the modulation of splice site choices in certain pre-mrnas .

presently, the precise functions of b-specific proteins are unknown. in particular, it is not clear to which extent they are important for both constitutive and alternative splicing, whether orthologs of some of these proteins are truly missing in yeast or have evolved so that they are not easily recognized or if yeast harbors other splicing factors that take over the constitutive roles of some of the b-specific proteins.

mfap <dig> was first identified as a component of the extracellular matrix  <cit> . later, the protein was found in spliceosome preparations  <cit> , was shown to interact with prp <dig> in pull-down experiments and to be required for pre-mrna processing  <cit> . interactions between mfap <dig> and other b-specific proteins were identified by yeast two-hybrid   <cit>  and in vitro binding studies  <cit> . due to its elongated, solvent exposed nature and predicted dense array of short protein binding motifs, mfap <dig> was suggested to act as a scaffold or ruler that engages multiple binding partners  <cit> . recently, the molecular details of the mfap1-prp <dig> interaction have been revealed by x-ray crystallography  <cit> , representing one of the few structurally characterized interactions between b-specific proteins besides snu23-prp <dig> and smu1-red  <cit> .

here, we investigated whether s. cerevisiae contains an ortholog of metazoan mfap <dig>  using inparanoid  <dig> and systematic blast searches, multiple sequence alignments, structure-guided interaction studies and a yeast growth assay, we identified the tri-snrnp-specific pre-mrna-splicing factor, suppressor of prp38- <dig> , as the so far missing mfap <dig> ortholog in s. cerevisiae.

RESULTS
identification of mfap <dig> orthologs in the eukaryotic tree of life
to investigate when in eukaryotic evolution an mfap1-coding gene has been acquired, we conducted an ortholog search using the inparanoid  <dig> orthology analysis tool  <cit> . the inparanoid methodology  <cit>  uses pairwise blast-based all-versus-all sequence comparisons to detect orthologs in sets of protein-coding genes from  <dig> species , with each gene represented by one protein. to exclude false positive hits that merely arise from co-occurrence of abundant, highly conserved domains, inparanoid uses a strict cut-off criterion of sequence coverage ≥ 50% and blast score ≥  <dig>  taking into account the presumably low sequence conservation of mfap <dig> due to the predicted structural disorder and the absence of folded protein domains  <cit> , we also performed reciprocal best blast hit  searches of mfap <dig> proteins against the same  <dig> sets of protein-coding genes with relaxed cut-off criteria . the rbh method has a relatively high specificity compared to other ortholog detection methods and its specificity is only marginally affected by changes in cut-off values  <cit> .

the combined results of both analyses are presented in fig.  <dig> and additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  an ortholog hit was classified as a high-confidence hit if identified by both methods . hits delivered by one method alone were classified as medium confidence hits . the case that the two methods identified two non-identical proteins as orthologous to the query did not occur. our results show that hsmfap <dig> proteins are widely distributed in metazoa , ichthyosporea , choanoflagellida , amoebozoa , plantae , sar , fungi  and ascomycota , but only sporadically present in excavata  and virtually absent in saccharomycotina  and in saccharomycetaceae . as expected, mfap <dig> was not present in prokaryotes  . mfap <dig> seems to be specifically absent in saccharomycotina, as it is present in species that branched off from the human lineage much earlier in evolution than fungi  but also in many closely related ascomycota species. in saccharomycotina, mfap <dig> was only found in yarrowia lipolytica  and wickerhamomyces ciferrii . since the latter species is more closely related to saccharomycetaceae, according to divergence time estimations by timetree.org , we performed an additional inparanoid ortholog search with wcmfap <dig> as a query. we again identified orthologs in many metazoan , fungal   and ascomycota  species . hits identified in a species with both queries  consistently resulted in the same protein. in addition, using wcmfap <dig> as a seed, we detected mfap <dig> orthologs in all saccharomycotina with the exception of saccharomycetaceae . these results indicate that mfap <dig> orthologs are present in all major branches of the eukaryotic tree of life but appear to be absent in saccharomyces cerevisiae and its close relatives .fig.  <dig> results summary of hsmfap <dig> ortholog searches with inparanoid  <dig>  the protein sequence of hsmfap <dig>  was used to search the inparanoid  <dig>  <cit>  ortholog database and used as templates in blast searches against the  <dig> species  covered by the inparanoid  <dig> program. the phylogenetic tree is based on the divergence times of the taxonomic groups obtained from timetree.org  <cit> . the number of identified mfap <dig> orthologs and the total number of analyzed species in respective taxonomic group is given in brackets. the branch color indicates the fraction of the analyzed species that contain an hsmfap <dig> ortholog; green > 50%, orange > 0% and < 50%, red 0%. see additional file  <dig> for detailed results and additional file  <dig> for uniprot ids of identified orthologs




stepwise blast searches focused on the fungal kingdom identify spp <dig> as a potential mfap <dig> ortholog in saccharomycetaceae
to investigate whether saccharomycetaceae have lost the mfap <dig> gene or contain a highly diverged mfap <dig> gene, we performed an mfap <dig> ortholog search focused on the fungal kingdom with relaxed stringency. the results are summarized in fig.  <dig>  the raw data are presented in additional file  <dig>  for this purpose we performed blast searches with hsmfap <dig> as a query against the proteomes of  <dig> fungal species that represent the fungal tree of life as published by medina et al.  <cit> . this tree represents a consensus phylogeny combining three independent phylogenomic approaches . although there is a certain overlap between species selected by inparanoid and by medina et al. and the total number of fungal species is similar , the phylogenetic tree by medina et al. likely represents more accurate phylogenetic relationships among the fungi. to adapt the search to the low sequence similarity usually found between distant mfap <dig> orthologs, we used the blosum <dig> scoring matrix and selected for hits with blast score ≥  <dig>  e-value ≤  <dig>  and query coverage ≥ 20%  or ≥ 10% . in addition, we required all further considered hits to represent the best hits in reverse blast searches.fig.  <dig> results of mfap <dig> ortholog searches focused on the fungal kingdom. the protein sequence of homo sapiens mfap <dig>   was used as template in blast searches against  <dig> fungi that represent the fungal tree of life as published by medina et al.  <cit> . seven mfap <dig> orthologs identified in the saccharomycotina subphylum, i.e. mfap <dig> orthologs of y. lipolytica , p. pastoris , d. hansenii , c. albicans , k. lactis , c. glabrata  and s. cerevisiae spp <dig> , were then used as query sequences in further individual blast searches against the  <dig> saccharomycotina species, including  <dig> saccharomycetaceae species, that are part of the  <dig> fungal species. the identification of an ortholog within a species is indicated by black boxes  or grey boxes . the fraction of the tree comprising non-saccharomycetaceae saccharomycotina nodes is colored in orange; the tree fraction comprising saccharomycetaceae nodes is colored in red. see additional file  <dig> for raw data of blast searches




as expected, mfap <dig> orthologs were detected in the majority of non-saccharomycotina fungi , as well as in several non-saccharomycetaceae saccharomycotina species , but were specifically absent in saccharomycetaceae . we assumed that if mfap <dig> orthologs exist in saccharomycetaceae, they would be evolutionary closest to neighboring saccharomycotina species. thus, we repeated the blast search with hsmfap <dig> orthologs identified in the saccharomycotina species yarrowia lipolytica , pichia pastoris , debaryomyces hansenii  and candida albicans  against the  <dig> saccharomycotina species of the medina et al. fungal tree of life. all four species identified mfap <dig> orthologs in the majority of non-saccharomycetaceae saccharomycotina species . in addition, all four also identified an mfap <dig> ortholog in the saccharomycetaceae organism kluyveromyces lactis . furthermore, saccharomycetaceae mfap <dig> orthologs were identified in candida glabrata  by dhmfap <dig> and in lachancea thermotolerans by ppmfap <dig>  besides six medium confidence hits  by ppmfap <dig>  we next selected k. lactis and c. glabrata mfap <dig> orthologs as queries. both queries identified orthologs in the same nine of  <dig> saccharomycetaceae species, including saccharomyces cerevisiae . in addition, the c. glabrata protein identified an ortholog in p. pastoris and k. lactis spp <dig> found orthologs in most non-saccharomycetaceae saccharomycotina species . finally, we performed the same analysis with the identified s. cerevisiae protein spp <dig> as query and found orthologs in the same saccharomycetaceae species  as with p. pastoris and c. glabrata in addition to one hit in non-saccharomycetaceae saccharomycotina . while the overall low sequence conservation of mfap <dig> orthologs is especially pronounced between saccharomycetaceae and neighboring saccharomycotina species, the sequences of the mfap <dig> orthologs of k. lactis  and p. pastoris are able to bridge this gap.

to test if spp <dig> proteins found in saccharomycetaceae indeed represent a group of mfap <dig> orthologs and not a different protein that coexists in mfap1-containing non-saccharomycetceae species, we used spp <dig> from s. cerevisiae as a query in our inparanoid-based ortholog search . scspp <dig> yielded orthologs in mycospaerella graminicola, sclerotinia sclerotiorum , pichia pastoris  – these proteins are the same as those identified in the initial search with hsmfap <dig> – and in all twelve saccharomycetaceae species. thus, we did not find any non-mfap <dig> protein as an scspp <dig> ortholog. these results show that spp <dig> is not closely related, according to the inparanoid cut-off criteria, to any non-mfap <dig> protein outside saccharomycetaceae, indicating that spp <dig> and mfap <dig> do not coexist as different proteins in non-saccharomycetaceae species. however, it is still possible that mfap <dig> and spp <dig> are highly similar proteins that emerged by convergent evolution and that exist in exactly complementary groups of organisms. it also cannot be excluded that mfap <dig> and spp <dig> might have emerged from the same ancestral gene by duplication  and that a different copy was lost in saccharomycetaceae  versus non-saccharomycetaceae .

s. cerevisiae spp <dig> shares physicochemical, biochemical and structural features with hsmfap1
the rather weak sequence similarity of saccharomycetaceae spp <dig> proteins to mfap <dig> proteins  renders an orthology assumption difficult if based on primary sequence data alone. to further test the assumption that mfap <dig> and spp <dig> proteins are orthologs and not just randomly best-matching proteins, we compared structural and functional data. intriguingly, s. cerevisiae spp <dig>  like mfap <dig>  is a known splicing factor  <cit> . moreover, scspp <dig> had been identified by its ability to suppress defects elicited by the prp38- <dig> allele  <cit> , which is associated with impaired spliceosome catalytic activation  <cit> , and its c-terminal half has been shown to directly interact with scprp <dig> in y2h assays  <cit> , the ortholog of hsprp <dig> that interacts with hsmfap <dig>  recent crystal structures of the hsprp38-hsmfap <dig> complex  and of the structurally highly similar prp38-mfap <dig> complex from the thermophilic fungus chaetomium thermophilum  together with binding studies of arginine-to-alanine mutants of the first and second arginine , which were sufficient to disrupt prp38-mfap <dig>  revealed a rxxxrxxr motif as a key prp38-binding element of mfap <dig>  <cit> . strikingly, the c-terminal halves of k. lactis and s. cerevisiae spp <dig> contain an identical or slightly modified motif, rxxxrxxr and rxxxrxxk, respectively . among mfap <dig> orthologs identified in this study, the first and second arginine residues are conserved in  <dig> % and the third arginine in  <dig> % of the cases, suggesting that most identified mfap <dig> orthologs interact with prp <dig> as well.fig.  <dig> conservation of the prp38-mfap <dig> interface. a, b cartoon representation of  the heterodimer of hsprp <dig>  and hsmfap <dig>   or of  the heterodimer of hsprp <dig>  and hsmfap <dig>  . key interaction residues are presented as sticks . dashed, black lines indicate hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. c excerpt from a multiple protein sequence alignment of mfap <dig> orthologs identified in this study. key prp38-interacting residues  are marked; percentage identity is given in brackets. in general, residue color intensity indicates level of sequence identity at that specific position; coloring starts at a sequence identity of 30%. blue - conserved hydrophobic residues; red – conserved positively charged residues; purple – conserved negatively charged residues; green – conserved glutamines; cyan – conserved histidines. h. sapiens mfap <dig>  k. lactis spp <dig> and s. cerevisiae spp <dig> are highlighted by boxes





scspp <dig>  hsmfap <dig> and the two previously known mfap <dig> orthologs ctmfap <dig>  <cit>  and c. elegans  mfap <dig>  <cit>  also share a number of physicochemical and biochemical properties, i.e.  a high fraction of charged residues ;  a low isoelectric point ;  an increased apparent molecular mass on sds-page ; and  pest elements, which are expected to reduce the half-lives of the proteins  <cit> , with pest-scores >  <dig> . in a multiple sequence alignment of all identified mfap <dig> orthologs, the pest element of scspp <dig> aligns with pest elements hsmfap <dig> 174– <dig>  ctmfap <dig> 105– <dig> and cemfap <dig> 192– <dig>  in addition, the proteins are predicted to share a similar structure in isolation, i.e. they are predicted to be intrinsically disordered , with most residues solvent exposed  and with a tendency to form α-helices  . structural disorder of hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig> was also previously predicted in independent studies  <cit> . indeed, cd spectroscopy showed that scspp <dig>  like hsmfap <dig>  has significant α-helical content in isolation, which gradually changes to a more random coil structure upon heating with no sharp transition , indicative of a lack of a stable tertiary fold. irrespective of the exact evolutionary relationship of yeast spp <dig> and metazoan mfap <dig> proteins, the above analyses indicate that both proteins are structurally very similar and share a prp38-binding motif.fig.  <dig> domain organization and cd spectra of mfap <dig> and spp <dig>  a secondary structure prediction and domain organization of spp <dig> from s. cerevisiae and of mfap <dig> from h. sapiens, c. thermophilum and c. elegans. red/gray bars – predicted α-helices/ß-strands; blue/yellow bars – predicted solvent exposed/buried regions; green bars – regions of predicted structural disorder. b, c cd spectra of hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig>  cd spectra  at 4 °c  and 90 °c  and cd melting curves  at 222 nm of  hsmfap130- <dig> and of  full-length scspp381




interaction studies corroborate similar functions of scspp <dig> and hsmfap1

scspp <dig> shares the ability of hsmfap <dig> to bind prp <dig>  as shown by y2h analyses  <cit> . we confirmed this interaction with isolated, recombinant, wild type scprp <dig> and scspp <dig> proteins that co-migrated on a gel filtration column . to further test if this interaction also uses the same interface as reported in the human and c. thermophilum prp38-mfap <dig> complexes  <cit> , we introduced point-mutations into scprp <dig> and scspp <dig> corresponding to complex-disrupting point-mutations in human prp <dig> and mfap <dig>  and tested interaction of the proteins by analytical gel filtration. analogous to the prp38-mfap <dig> complexes  <cit> , a d189a mutation in scprp <dig>  as well as a r192a mutation in scspp <dig>  led to disruption of the complex . furthermore, scspp381177- <dig>  corresponding to hsmfap1267- <dig>  the minimal mfap <dig> fragment used for crystallization of the hsprp38-hsmfap <dig> complex  <cit> , was sufficient to bind scprp <dig> , further underlining the structural and functional similarities. in addition, we could assemble a trimeric scsnu23116-169-scprp38-scspp381177- <dig> complex , resembling the minimal trimeric snu23-prp38-mfap <dig> complex in the thermophilic fungus c. thermophilum, of which the crystal structure has been solved  <cit> . these results indicate that scspp <dig> and hsmfap <dig> bind their respective prp <dig> partners via equivalent interfaces and via the same key residues, and that spp <dig> is involved in the same trimeric complex as mfap <dig> fig.  <dig> the prp38-mfap1/spp <dig> interface is conserved between yeast and human. coomassie blue-stained sds-page gels and corresponding chromatograms of analytical gel filtration experiments with full-length scprp <dig> and scspp <dig>  a wild type proteins. b wild type scspp <dig> in combination with the scprp <dig> d189a variant or wild type scprp <dig> in combination with the scspp <dig> r192a variant. all experiments were performed with a superdex  <dig>  <dig> / <dig> column . m – marker; l – load; horizontal black lines – fractions analyzed by sds-page

to investigate if the structural similarity between scspp <dig> and hsmfap <dig> is high enough so that they can substitute for each other in prp <dig> binding, we performed cross-species interaction studies. indeed, scprp <dig> bound hsmfap1267- <dig>  and hsprp38ntd+, lacking the complex, multicellular organism-specific rs domain, stably interacted with scspp <dig> . the latter interaction did not form with the d145a variant of hsprp38ntd+ . these results show that spp <dig> and mfap <dig> can substitute for each other in spliceosomal complexes and thus might share a similar interaction network in the spliceosome.fig.  <dig> cross-species interaction studies. coomassie blue-stained sds-page gels and corresponding chromatograms of analytical gel filtration experiments. a

human mfap <dig> can partially substitute for yeast spp <dig> in its function to rescue the conditionally lethal mutant yeast strain prp38-1
the conditionally lethal yeast strain prp38- <dig> produces a mutant version of the prp <dig> protein and displays a growth defect at 37 °c  <cit> . expression of plasmid-encoded wild type scprp <dig> but also of scspp <dig> efficiently suppresses this growth defect  <cit> . to test if hsmfap <dig> can exploit its capability to bind scprp <dig> in a scspp381-like manner to also functionally substitute for scspp <dig> in vivo, we performed yeast growth assays. as expected, all tested prp <dig> and prp38- <dig> strains grew equally well at 23 °c . at 37 °c , wild type prp <dig> displayed slightly reduced growth compared to 23 °c . as previously reported, prp38- <dig> showed complete growth arrest at 37 °c . growth of prp38- <dig> at 37 °c was largely restored by transformation with a plasmid encoding wild type scprp <dig> , partially restored by plasmids encoding scspp <dig>  and weakly restored by a plasmid encoding hsmfap <dig> . although expression of plasmid-encoded hsmfap <dig> did not suppress prp38- <dig> as efficiently as over-production of scspp <dig>  we conclude that hsmfap <dig> can fulfill certain prp38-supporting functions of scspp <dig> in yeast.fig.  <dig>

discussion
hsmfap <dig> is a cryptic ortholog of the yeast splicing factor spp381
proteomics analyses revealed that almost all factors required for constitutive splicing in s. cerevisiae are also present in human spliceosomes  <cit> . presently, yeast proteins with missing human orthologs include the u <dig> factors prp <dig> and snu <dig>  the prp19-associated complex protein ntc <dig>  the disassembly factor ntr <dig>  <cit>  and the u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp-specific protein spp <dig>  compared to yeast, human spliceosomes include ~  <dig> additional, predominantly non-snrnp proteins, whose precise functions during splicing are in many cases unclear  <cit> .

here, we applied the ortholog detection tool inparanoid  <dig> as well as stepwise blast searches to identify mfap <dig> as a likely ortholog of the s. cerevisiae tri-snrnp-specific protein spp <dig>  by phyletic profiling we unambiguously identified mfap <dig> orthologs in nearly all major branches of the eukaryotic tree of life, including in organisms that split from the common lineage with multicellular eukaryotes about  <dig>  billion years ago  <cit> , with the exception of saccharomycetaceae, that separated  <dig>  billion years ago  <cit>  , where stepwise blast searches instead uncovered the spp <dig> protein. the evolutionary relationship between mfap <dig> and spp <dig> was further supported by strong structural similarities between hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig> that would allow spp <dig> to fulfill a role as a flexible scaffolding factor as proposed for mfap <dig>  <cit> . finally, we presented two key functional indications supporting the assumed evolutionary connection. first, our interaction studies with wild type proteins, single point mutants that failed to interact and cross-species interactions between hsprp38/scprp <dig> and hsmfap1/scspp <dig>  showed that the scprp38-scspp <dig> complex is established via a very similar interface to the one observed in the recently structurally characterized hsprp38-hsmfap <dig> complex  <cit> . although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig> evolved independently to bind the same surface on prp <dig>  it is rather unlikely that in this case both interactions would rely on exactly corresponding residues. in addition, mfap <dig> and spp <dig> both bind prp <dig> in the context of a trimeric complex with snu <dig>  further increasing the likelihood of an evolutionary relationship between mfap <dig> and spp <dig>  second, hsmfap <dig>  like scspp <dig>  weakly suppresses the temperature-induced growth defect of yeast strain prp38- <dig>  most likely by interacting with and stabilizing the mutated prp <dig> protein, suggesting that hsmfap <dig> can fulfill certain scspp <dig> functions in vivo. we acknowledge the possibility that a protein that is evolutionarily unrelated to spp <dig> might also be able to bind and stabilize the mutated prp <dig> protein in prp38- <dig>  however, the ability to rescue this growth defect likely requires a set of specific features, including a specific binding mode to prp <dig>  certain physicochemical properties and the ability to interact with additional binding partners, that seem be overlapping between hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig> to a large degree and are unlikely to be shared by unrelated proteins. the reduced level of suppression by hsmfap <dig> compared to scspp <dig> might be explained by a lower expression level of plasmid-encoded hsmfap <dig> compared to plasmid-encoded scspp <dig> in the prp38- <dig> strain context, a potentially tighter interaction of scprp38-scspp <dig> versus scprp38-hsmfap <dig> and/or the inability of hsmfap <dig> to bind one or more binding partners of scspp <dig> other than prp <dig> in yeast. the latter two possibilities are supported by the nature of the protein-binding sites of mfap <dig> and spp381; they comprise short, peptide motif-like sequences with limited structural restraints  <cit> . thus, the binding sites are highly likely, over the course of evolution, to strongly adapt to their diverging interaction partners. this notion is in agreement with the overall low sequence similarity between scspp <dig> and hsmfap <dig> table  <dig> summary of ortholog analyses

taken together, the sequence similarity between mfap <dig> and spp <dig> does not suffice to delineate their precise evolutionary relationships. yet, they are structurally and functionally similar to an extent that they can substitute for each other. this suggests that, indeed, both proteins may represent orthologs although other evolutionary scenarios cannot be entirely ruled out.

functional characteristics of mfap <dig> and spp <dig> proteins may allow for high evolutionary rates of sequence divergence
identification of a common evolutionary origin of proteins by sequence comparisons is increasingly challenging with decreasing sequence conservation. fast diverging sequences lack the evolutionary pressure commonly associated with the maintenance of a particular 3d fold or of extended interaction surfaces. the human b-specific protein mfap <dig> is characterized by a lack of stable tertiary structure, structural flexibility and relatively short, but nevertheless high-affine, protein-protein interaction sites and plays a role as an elongated scaffolding factor that could transmit conformational changes within the spliceosome  <cit> . these functional characteristics likely allow for a high sequence divergence rate during evolution, in particular in regions of the protein that only require the maintenance of an elongated, flexible structure.

indeed, the sequence identity between known mfap <dig> orthologs is low and even less recognizable for evolutionary distant mfap <dig> orthologs identified in our study . in this context it is not surprising that mfap <dig> and saccharomycetaceae spp <dig> sequences also exhibit a low sequence identity. more surprising, however, is the low sequence conservation between saccharomycotina and other ascomycota species, between saccharomycotina and saccharomycetaceae, and even between neighboring saccharomycetaceae organisms .

liberation from the tri-snrnp may enable b-specific proteins to perform their functions in a regulated manner
in addition to the large number of human splicing factors that do not have an obvious conserved counterpart in yeast  <cit> , “reprogramming” of splicing factors prp <dig> and snu <dig> from stable snrnp components in yeast to non-snrnp proteins in human  illustrates a lower level of fixed pre-organization of metazoan spliceosomes, even with respect to core splicing factors. in yeast, scprp <dig> and scsnu <dig> are recruited at the same time and with the same efficiency as all other u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp components to cross-intron spliceosomal a complexes  <cit> . while their precise roles during spliceosome activation are still unclear, it is obvious that in a situation as encountered in yeast, there is no possibility to regulate, for example, the kinetics of spliceosome activation via a more or less efficient recruitment of prp <dig> or snu <dig> compared to other tri-snrnp components. the situation is decisively different in metazoa, where prp <dig> and snu <dig> are non-snrnp proteins   <cit> . while they are still recruited at the stage of b complex formation, irrespective of whether the b complex originated from a cross intron a complex  <cit>  or a cross-exon complex  <cit> , their binding could, in principle, be regulated independent of the binding of the u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp. thus, while e.g. prp <dig> most likely can influence the efficiency of catalytic activation also in complex, multicellular eukaryotes  <cit> , the timing of when it unfolds this activity could differ, for example, in two competing alternative splicing situations . differential binding of prp <dig> and snu <dig> could thus promote catalytic activation of two competing spliceosomal complexes with a different efficiency and thus influence the relative frequency with which mutually exclusive splice sites are used.fig.  <dig> recruitment of prp <dig>  snu <dig> and mfap1/spp <dig> to the human or yeast spliceosomes. human prp <dig>  snu <dig>  mfap <dig> and other b-specific proteins enter the spliceosome at the complex b stage independent of the tri-snrnp. in contrast, yeast prp <dig>  snu <dig> and the hsmfap <dig> ortholog scspp <dig> are tri-snrnp-specific proteins and thus first bind to the tri-snrnp. subsequently, the tri-snrnp enters the spliceosome to form complex b. in human and yeast, prp <dig>  snu <dig> and mfap1/spp <dig> leave the spliceosome during b to bact complex transition




our findings suggest that a similar functional relationship as between yeast and metazoan prp <dig> and snu <dig> proteins  <cit>  exists between yeast spp <dig> and metazoan mfap <dig> proteins. as disruption of the scspp <dig> gene leads to severe growth defects and accumulation of unspliced pre-mrna in vivo  <cit> , scspp <dig> is an important, albeit not essential, splicing factor that apparently acts in the same process as scprp <dig>  we showed that scspp <dig> and hsmfap <dig> exhibit cross-species interactions with the respective prp <dig> proteins, suggesting that mfap <dig> may be responsible for spp381-like functions in complex, multicellular eukaryotes. during functional pairing of splice sites after initial cross-intron or cross-exon spliceosome assembly, spliceosomes face the problem of locating and bringing together spliceosomal subunits that are bound at the intron ends and thus may be spatially separated  <cit> . elongated proteins that are specifically recruited at this stage, such as hsmfap <dig> and scspp <dig>  are well suited to help align and gather spatially separated parts of the spliceosome. they could serve as scaffolds or rulers, e.g. during functional pairing of splice sites, by using limited-length binding epitopes arrayed along their sequence to engage multiple binding partners  <cit> . however, like scprp <dig> and scsnu <dig>  scspp <dig> is a stable component of the u4/u <dig> u <dig> tri-snrnp  <cit> , while hsmfap <dig>  like hsprp <dig> and hssnu <dig>  is a non-snrnp b-specific protein  <cit>  . as in the case of yeast and metazoan prp <dig> and snu <dig>  the tri-snrnp nature of scspp <dig> mandates that it is always recruited to spliceosomal b complexes together with other tri-snrnp components, thus rendering its function constitutive. in contrast, the non-snrnp, b-specific mfap <dig> protein could be differentially recruited in different, mutually exclusive, splicing situations. such variable recruitment could influence the relative efficiencies with which competing, alternative splice events are carried out.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed the so far uncharted evolutionary backgrounds of the h. sapiens b-specific protein mfap <dig> and of the s. cerevisiae tri-snrnp protein spp <dig>  prior to this work, mfap <dig> was thought to exclusively exist in spliceosomes of complex, multicellular organisms. we have shown that an mfap <dig> ortholog is present not only in s. cerevisiae but also in organisms that separated from the common lineage with complex, multicellular eukaryotes about  <dig>  billion years ago. spp <dig> was suggested to be one of only five yeast splicing factors without a human ortholog. its evolutionary connection to mfap <dig> reduces this number to four, raising the question if finally all ancient yeast splicing factors turn out to be conserved in complex, multicellular eukaryotes. as exemplified by the present study, identifying evolutionary connections between proteins may point to potential functions as well as potential interaction partners of poorly characterized proteins.
