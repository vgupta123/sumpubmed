BACKGROUND
clostridium difficile is a component of the human colonic flora. if the physiological bacterial flora in the colon is altered or damaged by antibiotics, especially by clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid  <cit> , c. difficile is able to multiply and to cause damage due to its production of several toxins. resulting conditions are antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis . severe cases might progress to toxic megacolon and end fatally  <cit> .

important virulence factors are secreted toxins tcda and tcdb, encoded by genes tcda and tcdb  <cit>  that form a pathogenicity locus together with regulatory genes  and a gene  encoding a holin-like pore-forming protein  <cit> . tcda and tcdb irreversibly modify gtpases from the ras superfamily resulting in disruption of vital signaling pathways of the cell and in cell death  <cit> . besides, some c. difficile strains harbor a binary toxin encoded by cdta and cdtb. the binary toxin appears to modify actin via its adp-ribosyltransferase activity. its clinical significance is not yet fully elucidated  <cit> 

the therapy of c. difficile infection includes rehydration, discontinuation of antibiotics triggering the condition, oral administration of vancomycin or metronidazole as well as surgical intervention in severe cases  <cit> . relapses are common, either due to surviving spores, or to re-infection. a possible role of probiotics is still investigated as well as the concept of transplanting feces in order to restore the physiological flora  <cit> . with increasing numbers of patients who receive long-term, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapies, c. difficile became an increasingly important problem in healthcare. case numbers as well as fatality rates are increasing; with the latter being attributed to the emergence of more virulent strains  <cit> .

transmissions of c. difficile and even outbreaks within hospital settings are common, given that spores are able to survive in a clinical environment and are resistant to alcoholic disinfectants  <cit> . hospitalizations, or residence in nursing homes, are significant risk factors for acquisition of c. difficile, and 50 % of patients who stayed in hospital for more than one month acquired c. difficile  <cit> . transmissions within healthcare setting justify infection control measures, in analogy to, e.g., methicillin-resistant s. aureus. besides barrier nursing, isolation, disinfection, etc., this also should include molecular typing in order to trace chains of infections. a variety of methods that included multilocus sequence typing , sequencing of the slpa gene, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis and ribotyping has been described previously  and genome sequencing might become an option in the future.

microarray-based rapid typing proved to be a convenient tool for mrsa genotyping  <cit>  allowing both, virulence and resistance gene detection and molecular typing within one experiment. therefore, a microarray-based assay was designed to prove this concept for c. difficile.

isolates were clustered into hybridization profiles  or strains based on overall hybridization profiles with emphasis to tcda/b and slpa alleles. isolates or strains were regarded as one hp in case of at least 88 % identity of positive/ambiguous/negative classifications for all probe positions covered, plus presence of identical tcda/b and slpa alleles. possibly mobile resistance markers were counted for the score, but they were, contrarily to tcda/b and slpa, not considered for the definition of hybridization profiles or strains. it still needs to be clarified whether these genes could be used as subtyping markers for isolates within one hp .

applying this approach, tested isolates and reference strains clustered into  <dig> distinct hybridization profiles . three additional profiles were predicted from published genome sequences, although they were not found experimentally. if several isolates with identical hybridization profiles were subjected to mlst, they yielded identical or related sequence types. occasionally, several ribotypes  were observed within one cluster and some ribotypes were present in different, although similar or related, clusters.fig.  <dig> splitstree graph based on hybridization profiles, showing the clustering of profiles into different clades as defined by mlst. for the issue of the tcd-negatives, see discussion.




in c. difficile, mlst-derived sequence types  cluster into five major clades  <cit> . hybridization profiles also can be clustered into these clades when analyzing their similarities .

clade i encompasses a variety of sequence types including st- <dig>  st- <dig>  st- <dig> and others  <cit> . it was found to correspond to the largest and most diverse cluster of hybridization profiles  comprising hp- <dig> to  <dig> 

clade ii comprised st-01/rt- <dig> strains  <cit> . it matched hybridization profiles  <dig> and  <dig>  beside reference strains, only two isolates were assigned to this clade indicating that the emergence and spread of st-01/rt- <dig> strains  <cit>  did not yet engulf the dresden region at the time when the samples were taken.

clade iii includes st-05/rt- <dig> strains  <cit>  corresponding hp- <dig> and − <dig>  clade iv consists of st-37/rt- <dig> or hp- <dig> and - <dig> strains while a clade v include st-11/rt- <dig> corresponding to hp- <dig> to hp- <dig>  st-127-like sts might form an additional clade according to eburst analysis , putatively named “clade vi” herein. it included the genome sequence of strain  <dig>  which translated into a 40th hybridization profile. it was not identified experimentally.

in the visualization using splitstree , the tcda/b negative isolates appear to form a separate clade. this, however, can be regarded as an artifact related to the relatively high number of probes recognizing the tcd locus .

alleles of slpa
the gene slpa encodes the surface layer protein. fifty four probes were designed to distinguish slpa alleles that are currently represented in genbank, with one or two probes recognizing one allele. table  <dig> shows the predicted patterns and the respective genbank entries as well as the corresponding ribotyping and/or mlst data for isolates identified within this study. the analysis predicted twenty-eight patterns; twenty-one were found. additionally, two patterns were observed which probably represent truncated variants of known alleles.table  <dig> alleles of spla, corresponding probes, genbank entries and typing data

five isolates  yielded no positive slpa signals. based on their overall hybridization profiles they clustered into two distinct clade i strains . however in hp- <dig>  ambiguous signals for one probe were observed which might indicate the presence of a truncated variant or divergent allele.

there was no direct correlation of slpa alleles, ribotyping and mlst, with isolates of some ribotypes or sts yielding different slpa alleles.

alleles of tcda/tcdb
four probes allowed distinguishing two tcda alleles. both alleles, tcdar <dig> and tcdacf <dig>  were found in this study; with the former one being more common and being detected in more diverse lineages. table  <dig> shows corresponding genbank entries, hps, rts, mlst types and slpa types. nineteen isolates were tcda-negative.table  <dig> alleles of tcda, corresponding probes, genbank entries and typing data

for tcdb, seven alleles were distinguished using nine probes , but only three, tcdbr <dig>  tcdb <dig> and tcdbcf <dig>  were experimentally identified. allele tcdb <dig> was the most common and widespread one. nineteen isolates were negative for tcdb; its absence correlated with the absence of tcda.table  <dig> alleles of tcdb, corresponding probes, genbank entries and typing data

co-localized genes tcdc and tcde were interrogated with one probe each. they were absent from all tcda/b-negative strains, but frequently they yielded also in other isolates negative or ambiguous results. this might be attributed to sub-optimal binding conditions for these individual probes, un-appreciated sequence variation or to a technical problem during probe synthesis, and should in future be overcome by re-design.

binary toxin
two alleles of the a component  of the binary toxin were theoretically predicted from published sequences as well as experimentally identified with four different oligonucleotide probes. isolates of rt-023/mlst clade iii yielded an additional pattern for which no matching genbank entry was identified. it is putatively named “cdtaclade iii” in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  for the b component , three alleles  were distinguishable with six probes.table  <dig> alleles of the binary toxin, corresponding probes, genbank entries and typing data

the variant cdta630 + cdtb <dig> was the most ubiquitous one in accordance to the predominance of clade  <dig>  although some isolates completely lacked cdta/b. in clade  <dig> isolates, ambiguous signals were frequently detected apparently due to a poor performance of two probes . clade ii strains harbored a distinct variant, cdtar20291 + cdtbr <dig>  isolates of rt- <dig> or mlst clade iii yielded “cdtaclade iii” while cdtb signals in these isolates were indistinguishable from the cdtbr <dig> allele. clade v isolates carried cdtar <dig> and a characteristic cdtb allele, cdtbm <dig>  finally, no cdta/b was detected in clade iv isolates, and a “clade vi” genome sequence  did also not include these genes.

ubiquitous resistance markers
the gene bcra, encoding the bacitracin atp binding cassette transporter bcra, was present in all c. difficile isolates but four. three probes could be used to identify three different alleles.

allele bcra <dig>  was present in all clade i and clade ii isolates. clade v isolates carried allele bcranap <dig> . clade iv and vi harbor bcracf <dig> which also yielded a signal with probe  <dig> while the binding site of  <dig> was more similar to the equivalent site in bcra <dig> . three tested clade iii isolates appeared bcra-negative. since no published genome sequence was available for that clade, it is not clear whether this lineage lacks the gene entirely, or harbors an unknown allele.

the gene lmrb, associated with lincomycin/clindamycin resistance was detected in all tested isolates, and in all published genome sequences analyzed. two probes were used to identify two different alleles. allele lmrb <dig> , was detected in the vast majority of isolates. in isolates associated with clade v, another allele, lmrbnap <dig>  was found.

likewise, vata  encoding a virginiamycin/streptogramin a acetyltransferase was found ubiquitously, in tested isolates as well as in analyzed genome sequences. two alleles were differentiated using two probes, vatanap <dig>  in clade v isolates and vata <dig>  in all others.

variable/mobile resistance markers
the presence of cat , erm  and tet, encoding tetracycline resistance, was variable. the gene cat was found in  <dig> isolates . the gene erm was detected in two reference strains, bi- <dig> and  <dig>  as well as in  <dig> isolates . tet was present in two reference strains, m <dig> and  <dig>  and in  <dig> isolates . carriage rates within c. difficile strains were ranging widely, with isolates of certain hybridization profiles  being virtually always positive for erm and/or tet.

for tet, five probes reacted in different combinations . an assignment to alleles was not performed because of several possible sources for error. these might include i) a simultaneous presence of different plasmids in one strain, ii) the existence of chimeric forms  and iii) possible irregular patterns for low-copy number plasmids with an effective target concentration around the detection limit of the linear amplification procedure.

other markers
two genes, vncs/vexp <dig> encoding a histidine kinase and a permease were found to always occur together. some similar strains  could be distinguished by their presence or absence.

several other markers contributed to specific profile showing different alleles that were uniform within a hp but could vary within a clade . these included genes encoding septum formation initiation protein , flagellin subunit c , cell wall proteins  <dig> and  <dig> 

discussion
a rapid, reproducible and convenient method for molecular typing of c. difficile was developed. it based on a linear multiplex amplification followed by array hybridization. target genes were resistance genes localized in published c. difficile genome sequences and toxin genes with their different alleles. in addition to these markers, other genes were selected based on the variability of their presence  or their sequence . alone these genes would not be suitable typing markers but taken together, they can be used to generate stable profiles or fingerprints that allow assignment to clusters or clades as defined by other methods.

genes that show clade-specific allelic variations also include the toxin genes. therefore, a topic for a future study could be a possible correlation of toxin alleles and/or of clonal complex affiliations to clinical severity. in order to check whether a possible higher virulence is caused by the actual toxin alleles, or by some other factor linked to phylogenetic background, a high number of isolates from defined conditions need to be typed and their toxin alleles need to be determined. the proposed system might be a suitable platform for such a task.

it can be assumed that ribotyping, slpa typing, mlst and array hybridization yield comparable phylogenetic information, i.e., strains that are recognized as similar/related by one method will also appear as similar/related by the other methods. however, there is no complete correlation. one ribotype might be associated with two similar array profiles or related mlst types and vice versa. single and multilocus typing schemes by design tend to emphasize subtle differences. isolates that are identical belong by definition to the same st, but single locus variants, and even those that differ in a single base exchange are defined to belong to another st. sts are numbered chronologically  so that their numbers yield no phylogenetic information. thus, sts with very different numbers might be still very similar. in order to cluster related sts, clonal complexes  or clades  <cit>  were introduced giving a more structured overview on the phylogeny of the target species. in c. difficile there are five major clades, at least one minor clade and several “singletons”, i.e., sts that have no known links to others  <cit> .

when converting hps to a splitstree graph, its topology is strikingly similar to a splitstree graph of mlst sequences as presented by dingle et al.  <cit> . the only significant difference is that all tcda/b negatives are categorized as one “branch”. this is an artifact caused by the high number of probes associated with this locus . the loss of this locus would thus significantly impact the overall hybridization profile overriding other features affecting a smaller number of probes. negative results of other markers, such as for slpa, would not have this effect because of the smaller number of probes involved.

with regard to practicalities, a major advantage for the array-based approach is that isolate typing as well as toxin gene detection and allele identification can be performed within one experiment by a single amplification reaction starting from clonal colony material. the amplification follows linear kinetics, utilizing one primer per target. this has the advantage of facilitating unlimited “multiplexing”, i.e., the simultaneous detection of multiple targets, and of being resistant to contaminations by amplicons from previous experiments. the disadvantage is a reduced sensitivity compared to standard, exponential pcr. however, since the assay was designed to characterize cultured and cloned bacterial cultures  this is not of relevance; and sequencing-based typing methods would also lead to nonsensical results when applied to polyclonal samples. in practical terms, protocol and time requirements, including hands-on-time, of the linear amplification are the same as for normal pcr. the subsequent hybridization procedure can be performed within half a day being more rapid than ribotyping. the assay as well as analysis and interpretation can largely be automatized. the set of probes can, possibly combined with mlst markers and spla sequences, also be mapped to “conventional” or “next generation” sequence data in order to rapidly obtain clinically relevant typing information out of an abundance of data and to create a database that encompasses both, in silico and in vitro typing data.

CONCLUSIONS
the microarray based assay allows rapid and high-throughput genotyping of clinical c. difficile isolates including toxin gene detection and strain assignment. overall hybridization profiles correlated with mlst-derived clades, and target genes that showed clade-specific allelic variations also included the toxin genes.
