BACKGROUND
co-evolution of humans and pathogens has exerted a dual selective pressure on the immune system of the host that strives to control infection and on the pathogens, which have developed various strategies to circumvent the host's immune responses.

leishmania  parasites are obligate intracellular pathogens that preferentially invade macrophages  where they replicate, ultimately causing a heterogeneous group of diseases that affects millions of people mainly in subarid, tropical and subtropical areas  <cit> . in view of their wide distribution, leishmaniasis remain embedded in impoverished populations and represent a paradigm of neglected diseases  <cit> .

to establish infection, the flagellated metacyclic promastigotes must enter mΦs and avoid triggering host responses. since mΦs play a dual function in infection, acting as a safe shelter for parasites but also as their ultimate killer, these cells are the alpha and the omega for host resistance or susceptibility to leishmania infection. cellular events occurring early during mΦ-parasite interactions are likely to influence the fate of infection. mΦs are able to secrete a remarkably diverse set of regulators known to influence the physiological functions and differentiation of neighboring cells. thus, activation of the innate immunity is required, by migrating parasitized dendritic cells to trigger an adaptive immune response of the th1-type. the latter induces interferon  γ-activated mΦs to kill leishmania parasites, promote disease healing and regulate resistance to re-infection as well as vaccine-induced immunity  <cit> .

leishmania have developed a range of sophisticated mechanisms to subvert the leishmanicidal activities of mΦs, by altering gene expression for cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, membrane receptors and molecules involved in signal transduction in infected cells  <cit> . although a wealth of crucial information has already been reported on the matter, it generated only a segmented view that hardly recognizes the full value of the biological consequences of this host-parasite conflict on a more global scale.

there is obviously a need for a high-throughput approach that generates a global view, in order to identify the salient modifications of the biological pathways triggered by intracellular parasitism. applying transcriptomics to study host-pathogen interactions has already contributed important insights to the understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis, and it is expanding further with the accumulation of genomic sequences of host organisms  and their pathogens  <cit> . indeed, several studies analyzing the human mΦ transcriptome upon viral  <cit> , bacterial  <cit>  or fungal  <cit>  infections have been published. however, to our knowledge, only one study, using the microarray technique has described the effect of l. major infection on the transcriptome of human mΦs  <cit> . more recently, a paper has described at the global scale the abrogation in the human monocytic thp <dig> cell line of ifnγ gene expression by this parasite species  <cit> .

gene expression profiling has also been used in several studies of different pathogenic microorganisms, including protozoan parasites  <cit> . these studies were applied to l. major, l. donovani, l. infantum and l. mexicana spp., using differential display or array probes amplified from either cdna or randomly sheared genomic dna; these techniques identified differentially expressed genes at different developmental stages  <cit> .

compared to other transcriptomic methods, serial analysis of gene expression  technology has proved to be a powerful tool for the quantitative cataloguing and comparison of genes expressed in cells or tissues from various physiological and pathological conditions. additionally, sage allows one to study the expression profiles of both known and unknown genes and as a result contributes to better genome annotation  <cit> . this technology was successfully applied to study the transcriptome of different parasites e.g., plasmodium falciparum  <cit> . schistosoma mansoni  <cit>  and trypanosoma congolense  <cit> , among others  <cit> .

as far as we know, this is the first study using the sage strategy that provides a high-throughput simultaneous analysis of gene expression in the context of the leishmania-human mΦ encounter. although the impact of the parasite on the human transcriptome appeared globally marginal, we identified several genes corresponding to diverse functional pathways that were differentially expressed upon infection, suggesting their likely involvement in the infectious process. interestingly, we individualized genes involved in complement or ifnγ pathways, and others belonging to s <dig> proteins, mhc molecules, apoptosis, cytokines and chemokines families. concurrently, our sage analysis unveiled a deep variation in parasite transcript abundance; such characterized transcripts could contribute to understanding the dynamics of gene expression in the intracellular parasite-stage.

RESULTS
three sage libraries were generated from:  resting human mΦs ,  human mΦs infected with l. major metacyclic promastigotes  and  l. major metacyclic promastigotes . a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  tags  were obtained from each library respectively . additional file  <dig>  shows the unique sage tags as function of total sequenced tags . the entire dataset discussed in this publication has been deposited in ncbi gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and is accessible through geo series accession number .

this table shows number of tags present at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig> and >  <dig> copies and number of occurrences in each library. numbers in parentheses indicate different unique tags in each category.

data analysis allows good discrimination between human and parasite tags generated in the same "mdm+lm" mixed sage library
to identify the transcripts that were modulated upon infection, we compared the three libraries that were constructed. we found that the mdm and lm libraries had  <dig> tags in common and  <dig>  tags were shared by the "mdm+lm" and lm libraries. in addition,  <dig>  tags were common between mdm and "mdm+lm" libraries . unexpectedly, this initial analysis showed that a large number of tags were specifically present in "mdm+lm" library.

in order to more confidently assign these tags to a human origin, they were compared to an assembled composite matrix containing a total of  <dig>  unique tags and built from  nine publicly available leukocyte sage libraries, that were generated from freshly isolated monocytes, m-csf differentiated, gm-csf differentiated and lps activated cells, immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells and un-fractionated populations of leukocytes,  the non-infected mdm library  and  a second in-house-generated mdm-m library .

as shown on the venn diagram in figure 1b, only  <dig> tags were shared by all libraries  and  <dig> tags  were shared by the lm library  and the non-infected human leukocyte libraries . this low level  of synonymy between human and parasite tags indicated that we could accurately discriminate human transcripts from parasite transcripts in the infected "mdm+lm" sample . it is not excluded that some of the  <dig>  human tags sorted in ab might correspond to parasite tags specifically expressed by the amastigote stage and absent in the promastigote-derived library. however, in this case we assumed that their number was likely to be in the same range as in ac and abc, so that most ab tags could be reasonably considered as mΦ-specific.

it must be stressed here that the apparently large number of "mdm+lm"-specific tags must be interpreted with caution because most of them were observed only once and may result from sequencing errors, the major source of noise inflating the number of unique tags. indeed, when we reanalyzed the data excluding tags that appeared only once , we ended up with  <dig>  human tags sorted in ab,  <dig>  tags common to the lm and "mdm+lm" libraries . interestingly, when excluding unique tags, number of these present only in "mdm+lm" library dropped from  <dig>  to  <dig>  tags. in fact, most of the tags occurring at high frequencies in the "mdm+lm" library were sorted into the ab or bc subsets. since these tags could be safely considered as identifying human  or parasite  transcripts, their respective frequencies could be taken as representative of the actual figure of the two species-specific transcripts in the initial mrna inputs. thus, we estimated that human and parasite mrnas contributed to 51% and 49% , respectively, of the "mdm+lm" sample.

impact of l. major infection on mΦ transcriptome
to investigate mΦ tags that were modulated by leishmania infection, we compared total tags present in the mdm library to those present in the "mdm+lm" library, after withdrawing tags of parasitic origin. most tags were expressed at similar levels between resting and leishmania-infected mdm. a semi-logarithmic plot  showed that both up- and down-modulated tags were distributed within a bell-shaped symmetric curve, though tailed for the tags up-regulated 12– <dig> times. this ratio profile clearly indicates that only some transcripts  were altered by leishmania infection. a scatter plot showing statistically scaled modulated transcripts is shown in additional file 2: scatter plot showing the comparison of mdm versus "mdm+lm" sage libraries.

starting with the matrix registering initial sage data, we recalculated tag frequencies in each of the  <dig> libraries, replaced by the nearest integer of tag frequencies for  <dig>  counts. for every tag, the sum of normalized frequencies was calculated and tags were discarded for values less than  <dig>  the resulting matrix  was split into two parts: the first registering the  <dig> tags with the highest sum of frequencies  and the second registering tags with lower frequencies .

using principal component analysis, observable either on 2d  or 3d graphs , landscapes generated with the top <dig> dataset showed that the closest relationship was between "mdm+lm" and their mdm control, and both were in the vicinity of the mdm-m sample. for the  <dig>  dataset, the closest relationship was between the mdm and mdm-m libraries. data analysis by hierarchical clustering using various modules of the tigr multiexperiment viewer package  led to similar conclusions .

taking these data sets as a whole, mdm infected with l. major parasites showed a transcriptional profile closer to that of non-infected cells but clearly different from that of lps-activated mΦs. in addition, the expression profiles of mdm, whether infected or not, were the closest to those of gm-csf- and m-csf-elicited cells.

these results globally indicate that the internalization of viable leishmania parasites in macrophage and their intracellular multiplication appear to induce only minor changes in the basal transcriptome profile with no indication of an obvious inflammatory response. nevertheless, a detailed comparison of mdm and "mdm+lm" profiles revealed changes that might be biologically relevant to the infectious process.

quantitative pcr experiments confirmed the changes in gene expression detected in human sage libraries
human tags were assigned to their corresponding genes using preditag® software  <cit>  and blast and then to their related biological processes using gene ontology  <cit> . quantitative real-time pcr was then used to assess the accuracy of the generated data. several candidate families of genes showing differential expression patterns in our human sage libraries were selected. to compare the q-pcr and sage data, "mdm+lm"/mdm, expression ratios were calculated .

the expression of  <dig> gene transcripts, identified by sage analysis, were tested using quatitative pcr. results show the occurrences  and the ratio of "mdm+lm"/mdm tags. the last column shows the 2-ΔΔct values, obtained by quantitative pcr.

on the whole, data generated by sage or q-pcr showed a good concordance between the trends  of expression ratios for 83% of the genes tested, although the response measured by the two techniques might differ in magnitude. the best correlations between sage and q-pcr data were observed for the genes that were abundantly expressed.

l. major infection induces a discreet but selective change in human mΦ transcripts
following tag annotation, we used the stripe software  <cit>  to screen for any spatial clustering across the human genome . statistical analysis of transcripts did not show any specific up- or down-modulated gene clustering across the human chromosomes. further analysis showed that the response of mdm to leishmania infection is characterized by the expression of genes encoding for proteins involved in several biological processes .

complement activation
we first focused our analysis on genes involved in innate immunity such as complement components. in vivo opsonization of leishmania promastigotes by c3b and c3bi permits the interaction with the mΦ complement receptors  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in addition, it is known that c1qa and c1qb molecules are highly up-regulated by activation. our results showed a drastic inhibition of gene transcription of these latter two proteins upon mdm infection. several other transcripts, such as c5r <dig>  c <dig>  c1qg or rgc <dig>  were also down-regulated after l. major infection.

s <dig> proteins
recently, a novel group of calcium-binding molecules, namely the phagocytic s <dig> proteins, was described as pro-inflammatory factors. these endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern  molecules, also called alarmins, play an important role in innate immunity. our results showed that s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> transcripts were repressed upon l. major infection. the s100a8/a <dig> complex has been shown to play an important role in phagocyte nadph oxidase activation, which contributes to intracellular parasite killing. their inhibition could be way for l. major to avoid reactive oxygen intermediate  killing. two other s <dig> family members were up-regulated . these two proteins are described as interacting with the n-termini of annexins a <dig> and a <dig>  forming a sophisticated ca2+ sensing system. the annexin a <dig>  which acts as a receptor of plasmin, a potent pro-inflammatory activator of human monocytes, was down-regulated twice. the identification of several transcripts of this family modulated by leishmania suggests a novel mechanism of inflammation and tissue damage in infected mΦs.

mhc class i and class ii molecules
we then investigated major histocompatibility complex  genes after l. major infection. class ii antigen-processing genes, including some cathepsins  and genes involved in class ii presentation such as cd <dig>  human leukocyte antigen -dp, hla-dq, hla-dr and hla-dm, were repressed in mdm cells relatively to samples from uninfected cells.

in contrast to the class ii pathway, genes involved in antigen processing and presentation via the mhc class i pathway  were not altered by parasite infection at  <dig> h, except for hla-b and calnexin genes, which were down-regulated, and hla-a, which was up-regulated.

interferon γ pathway
inhibition of the ifnγ pathway appears to be a mechanism that is widely used by different pathogens to subvert the host responses  <cit> . ifnγ, a potent inducer of mhc class ii expression in mΦs and hence of antigen presentation, once bound to its receptor, leads to stat <dig> phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus and to ifn regulatory factor  activation, which play a key role in the induction of a large set of mΦ effector molecules involved in host defense and inflammation. our results showed a significant decrease in ifngr <dig>  stat <dig> and irf <dig> transcripts in parasite infected mdm.

apoptosis
programmed cell death plays a pivotal role in normal tissue development and in pathological conditions  <cit> . interestingly, leishmania inhibits host cell apoptosis pathways in order to favor its own multiplication  <cit> . we annotated several tags as apoptotic and anti-apoptotic family members. transcripts of caspase  <dig> , acyl coenzyme a-binding protein , death inducer-obliterator- <dig>  and bcl2-related protein a <dig> , are pro-apoptotic proteins or induced by apoptosis, and were down-modulated upon infection. in addition, an anti-apoptotic gene transcript called defender against cell death- <dig>  was slightly induced.

cytokines and chemokines
we finally focused on cytokine and chemokine transcripts. several were up-regulated upon infection e.g., il- <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> or nfil <dig>  on the other hand, we noted that the mrna expression levels of different chemokines and their ligands, i.e., ccr <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  ccl4l <dig> or cklfsf <dig>  were drastically inhibited upon infection. as expected, the transcripts of the pivotal cytokine il <dig> were strongly up-regulated , even though the assigned tag did not correspond to the tag directly following the poly-a signal. however, we were not able to unambiguously assign tags corresponding to other cytokines, classically reported to be altered after leishmania infection .

transcriptome analysis of extra- and intracellular specific stages of l. major parasites
our analysis also included the study of leishmania transcriptome alterations, once parasites were exposed to the phagolysosomal intracellular environment and transform into amastigotes. we focused on  the most highly expressed transcripts at the metacyclic stage and  differentially expressed tags between the intracellular and extracellular stages of l. major parasite.

annotation of l. major tags from the metacyclic parasite sage library
a total of  <dig>  tags corresponding to  <dig>  unique tags were generated from the metacyclic stage of the l. major library . the  <dig> most abundant ones represented  <dig> % of the total number of unique tags  but totaled up to 40% of the entire collection of parasite tags .

tag-to-gene mapping was done for these most abundant  and total tags of the l. major glc <dig> library transcripts using blast against the friedlin l. major genome. this snapshot of the major parasitic transcripts showed that  <dig> out of  <dig> tags  mapped unambiguously to their genes with 100% sequence identity . twenty-seven tags mapped to a unique gene and  <dig> mapped to two or more genes belonging to the same family. among these assigned tags,  <dig> tags were located in the 3' region, downstream the stop codon and three matched inside the cds. finally, from the tags present at least twice , we were able to assign  <dig>  tags to their genes .

this table shows annotated tags from the  <dig> most abundant tags, their occurrences in the lm library, their corresponding access numbers and protein names in genedb. a table with all annotated leishmania tags are available as additional file  <dig> 

through this annotation, several transcripts were found encoding for ribosomal proteins including 40s, 60s, l1a, l <dig>  i <dig>  s <dig> and s27a ribosomal proteins. this analysis also revealed the abundant expression of mrna encoding for histones h <dig>  h2a and h <dig>  for ubiquitin related proteins, tubulin and microtubule associated protein among others .

preferential expression of transcripts in l. major parasites at the intracellular stage
when comparing libraries, we found  <dig>  tags  of them co-expressed in the "mdm+lm" and lm, but absent in other human libraries . statistical analysis and fold increase levels revealed that  <dig> of these tags were differentially expressed between metacyclic promastigotes  and intracellular parasites , with  <dig> tags preferentially expressed by intramacrophagic parasites .

tag-to-gene mapping of these  <dig> tags showed that  <dig>  of them were unambiguously mapped to their genes. among them, only  <dig> tags mapped to a unique gene and eight mapped to genes within the same family.

this analysis also revealed differential expression of mrna encoding for different proteins including an amastin-like protein, histones h <dig> and h2b, tubulin tyrosine ligase, reiske iron-sulfur protein precursor and several ribosomal proteins . interestingly,  <dig> of the assigned tags corresponded to hypothetical proteins with conserved domains and/or unknown functions.

this table shows annotated tags from the  <dig> differentially expressed tags at the intracellular l. major stage, their occurrences in the lm and "mdm+lm" sage libraries and their corresponding access numbers and protein names in genedb. underlined accession numbers correspond to genes tested by quantitative rt-pcr; results are presented as mean 2-ΔΔct values ± sd obtained with intracellular  or with amastigote-like axenic  parasites. nd: non-determined.

stage-specific preferential expression of parasite transcripts is confirmed by quantitative pcr experiments
we used quantitative real-time pcr to validate the accuracy of the sage data generated. q-pcr was also performed on cdna obtained from amastigote-like axenic parasites of l. major.

by comparing "mdm+lm"/mdm tags ratios, q-pcr showed the same trend towards the up-regulated expression of all selected transcripts, but one, in intracellular parasites compared to l. major promastigote metacyclic parasites . unexpectedly, 33% of the tested transcripts that were up-regulated in intracellular amastigotes, using sage and q-pcr technologies, were down-regulated in the amastigote-like parasites obtained by culture in axenic conditions. this result suggests that the transcriptome profile of l. major amastigote-like axenic parasites may not reproduce the profile expressed by the naturally induced intracellular amastigote stage and that the biological results obtained with the former parasite should be cautiously extrapolated to the latter parasite form.

discussion
genome-wide expression profiling offers new perspectives for studying host-pathogen interactions to decipher, at the transcriptional level, how host cells react to infection and how pathogens adapt to their host's microenvironment. in the present study, we took advantage of sage to analyze the transcriptomes of both the infected mΦ and the intracellular parasite leishmania using a one-step approach. our working hypothesis was that, having extracted the bulk of mrna molecules from a co-culture of parasites and infected mΦs, it would be possible to separate, in the resulting sage library, the respective contributions of each organism to the mixed collection of tags. the proportion of ambiguous gene signatures was found to be lower than  <dig> %, confirming the validity of this approach. such unambiguous tag species identification would be more difficult to reach using alternative high-throughput transcriptomic methods, such as microarrays, due to the difficulties in assessing the extent of cross-hybridization between the human and the parasite transcripts.

separating the contribution of both organisms in an infected mΦsage library raised no technical problems and could be performed on a desktop computer using the functions of a commercial database management system . to distinguish tags according to their origin, we considered that merging all publicly available leukocyte libraries would generate a set of tags that are representative of human transcripts. despite this extended coverage, it is clear that the deconvolution of both transcriptomes could not be complete, since unmatched tags that could not be ascribed to either of the two species  may either correspond to very specific human transcripts expressed only in leishmania-infected mΦs and never generated elsewhere or may reveal stage-specific parasite transcripts strictly specific of the intracellular stage. this problem was pointed out in a recent study  <cit> , suggesting that the human genome might actually contain twice as many transcribed regions as currently annotated. moreover, the encode project consortium highlighted the number and complexity of the rna transcripts generated comparatively to the small number of protein-coding genes  currently annotated on the human genome  <cit> .

sage was used as a quantitative approach, to evaluate the expression levels of mrnas and to calculate the respective amount of material from human or parasite origin. with the reasonable assumption that mrnas originated only from living cells, our data demonstrated the importance  of the parasitic load in infected cells.

in spite of this heavy parasitic burden, a salient feature emerged from multivariate statistics: that parasite infection has, at the global level, an apparent marginal impact  on the expression profile of infected mΦs. thus, the mrna profile of infected mΦs contrasted with that of monocytes exposed to lps because it revealed many fewer alterations in gene expression.

however, although leishmania parasites do not seem to induce dramatic changes in the transcriptional remodeling program of mΦs, a closer analysis detected physiologically significant alterations in gene transcription. despite their discreetness, these alterations could harmfully weaken macrophages' microbicidal defense task and homing properties. indeed, our analysis showed that several mΦ antiparasitic pathways were altered at the level of mrna expression upon infection by l. major parasites. in particular, we were able to show that several members of the s100a family, among others, are up- or down-regulated by infection. this is in contrast to a previous study using microarray technology that reported almost stable signals between non-infected mΦs as compared to l. major-infected mΦs for this gene family  <cit> . other differences in the expression levels of several chemokine family members were observed between the two studies, except for cxcl <dig> and il <dig> transcripts, which were strongly up-regulated.

whether the discrepancies between the two approaches reflect differences in the experimental protocols used by the two studies  or are attributable to differences in the sensitivity of the two techniques to accurately quantitate the mrna of expressed genes is unclear. it is noteworthy that our results concerning the ifnγ pathway, are in agreement with those obtained recently by dogra et al. in thp1-infected cells  <cit> . indeed, transcripts of stat- <dig>  a key actor of this pathway, were drastically down-regulated at  <dig> h after infection, though there is no external activation by ifnγ. in addition, we found that several ifnγ-inducible chemokines  were down-modulated. since key proteins belonging to this pathway are also inhibited upon l. major infection , such effects render the mΦ refractory to any potential activation by ifnγ and obviously favor parasite survival. other genes, among those involved in antigen presentation and implicated in the stabilization and the recycling of classical mhc class ii and in the binding and the capture of antigens were also down-modulated by l. major, as reported by chaussabel et al. and dogra et al.  <cit> .

our results also show that several genes encoding pro-inflammatory mediators were up-regulated, while other family members were down-modulated. this indicates that leishmania have a remarkable capacity to specifically inhibits the transcription of several molecules associated with pro-inflammatory responses. it is notable that this peculiarity of l. major infection does not completely fit – in contrast to other pathogens  – with the so called "common host-transcriptional response"  <cit> , stressing the particularity of this parasite. this is probably a survival mechanism whereby the parasites can inhibit a harmful inflammatory reaction in order to slip silently into the mΦ and successfully establish inside the host.

in addition to the analysis of the mΦ transcriptome, in the last  <dig> years, several studies have focused on the parasitic transcriptome taking advantage of the availability of l. major genome sequence  <cit> . although this genome , was declared to be finished in  <dig>  <cit> , only  <dig>  l. major ests originating from cdna libraries of various sources, such as promastigote or amastigote full length cdna libraries, are reported on ncbi.

hence, our tag-to-gene mapping for parasite transcripts was rather encouraging, compared to the number of sequenced tags. indeed, we were able to list up to  <dig> tags expressed in at least two copies in the metacyclic promastigote stage but totally absent from the intracellular amastigote stage, generating useful data for better data mining. in addition, among the tags common to l. major promastigote and mΦ-infected libraries, 19%  were differentially expressed. this led us to estimate  the transcripts differentially expressed, between the two parasitic stages, to roughly  <dig>  tags, representing approximately 20% of transcripts if one considers the  <dig>  annotated leishmania genes registered in the databases.

this figure is several-fold higher than those reported from a variety of leishmania species , which clearly show limited differences using microarrays  in stage-specific gene expression between the promastigote and amastigote life stages. these studies also show that the vast majority of genes are constitutively expressed  <cit> . one should note that these studies analyzed the amastigote transcripts, either using amastigote parasites derived from balb/c lesions or axenic amastigotes obtained in vitro, whereas our study used the amastigotes derived from human mΦs.

however, while analyzing the functional significance of gene expression in leishmania, we should consider that it is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level. as highlighted by cohen-freue et al.  <cit> , the alteration in mrna levels of regulated genes in leishmania does not necessarily correlate with subsequent protein abundance. the functional significance is better manifested at the protein level, which is regulated by mechanisms such as stage-specific translational control, rna stability, processing events and post-translational modifications. nonetheless and despite these limitations, transcriptomic approaches for leishmania could mainly help to better annotate its genome and to study the stability and translational regulation of its transcripts.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, we provide here for the first time a large-scale gene expression profile of both the infected human mΦ and the infective form of l. major using sage. this set of expressed genes deserves future rounds of data mining and experimental work, since it contains latent information about proteins susceptible to behaving as antigens and being evaluated as candidates in a vaccine approach. these data also provide the basis for studies in progress that aim to compare, at the molecular level, various strains of leishmania known to differ by their behavior at the physiopathological level. thus, comparing viscerotropic strains, e.g., l. infantum or l. donovani, to strictly dermotropic strains e.g., l. major, may reveal differences at the level of parasite-mΦ interactions that could indicate cellular targets of parasite virulence factors as well as decipher mechanisms of specific tissular tropism.
