BACKGROUND
metabonomics has been widely used to investigate new biomarkers of disease at different stages and drug-induced toxicities using analytical techniques including nmr  <cit>  and hplc/ms  <cit> . however, it is important to note that the metabolite profile in animal urine can be affected by various environmental factors that include gender, age, species, diet, water intake, and gut microflora  <cit> . age can affect a metabolic profile due to the non-linear development of various organs, which also affects the level of biliary activity. the aforementioned environmental factors will also influence the metabolic profile and impact statistical and quantitative analysis of the data. as a result, choosing an inappropriate control population and data normalization factors for a metabonomics study may reveal biased biomarkers of disease or drug toxicity. it is recognized that some preprocessing of metabonomics data is required, however, the question remains as to the best method for normalizing the data prior to statistical analyses  <cit> . the importance of carefully selecting age-matched controls has been previously noted  <cit> . as such, it is necessary to first study the age-related changes in the urinary metabolites of control animals in order to facilitate drug toxicity evaluation using metabonomics techniques.

to date, the bulk of age-related studies  have been performed using technologies including both high field nmr and lc/ms combined with advanced chemometric and pattern recognition techniques  <cit> . age-related changes in urinary metabolites have been observed over a five month period using normal wister-derived rats as the model  <cit> . in addition, the same group also investigated the differences in metabolite profiles between male zucker  obese and wister-derived rats at  <dig> weeks old and over  <dig> to  <dig> weeks of age  <cit> .

the present study was originally designed for tracking early biomarkers of pediatric drug toxicity at each major development stage using male sprague-dawley  rats at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> days old as models of human toddlers, young and mature adults, respectively. here, we evaluate the effects of different normalization procedures on the statistical and quantitative analysis of nmr data within a group of control, male sd rats at three ages. we also describe the nmr and uplc/ms-observed changes in the endogenous metabolic profile associated with aging and development in the same groups of non-treated male rats. the results reported here are a by-product of ongoing studies conducted at the center for drug evaluation and research .

RESULTS
effects of normalization factor on pca of nmr data
effects of normalization factor on quantitative analysis of nmr data
the concentrations obtained by analysis with chenomx nmr suite  are determined relative to the sodium 3-trimethyl-silyl-propionate  concentration within each sample. the tmsp concentration is a value that is defined by the user prior to analysis of the spectrum. however, the effects of tmsp volatility and other factors that may result in variation of the tmsp concentration are not accounted for in determining the concentrations of the metabolites. select metabolites from urine samples obtained from  <dig> day old control sd rats in two separate studies were quantified and compared. the concentrations were additionally normalized either by the creatinine concentration in the individual samples or by the tmsp peak intensity/total spectra intensity and the datasets compared.

nmr analysis of urine
total intensity normalization was utilized for data analysis in this metabonomics study due to the minimized bias between the three age groups. as mentioned above, additional file  <dig> shows the results of pca analysis of the nmr-based metabonomics data from the three age groups. this observation was similar to results obtained by uplc/ms . the loadings plot  represents the chemical shifts for molecules responsible for the significant contributions to the age clustering. in this study, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, and acetate were molecules associated with aging and development of the animals.

other positive ions that contributed most to the age-related clustering according to their pca significance are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  these ions were visually re-examined through extracted ion chromatograms  for each m/z value in order to exclude false signals that may have been selected by the software. hippuric acid  and kynurenic acid salt  were detected as ions that increased in older rats. their identification was based on the detected exact mass accuracy and further confirmed with authentic standards and retention times. the ion with m/z  <dig>  at tr  <dig>  min was also detected as an up-regulated compound. table  <dig> shows other ions that were detected as being down-regulated biomolecules, which included those with retention times at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  min and corresponding m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> .,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

uplc/ms in negative mode
typical total ion chromatograms resulting from negative mode analysis of urine from a  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> day old rats are displayed in additional file  <dig>  the mass spectrum of hippuric acid  is shown as an inset in additional file  <dig>  from visual examination of the chromatograms in additional file  <dig>  some age-related differences to the urinary profiles e.g. ion with m/z  <dig>  at tr  <dig>  were readily observed as increased with aging. pca analysis was also employed to fully characterize the metabolic changes related to animal aging and the developmental process. the pca 3d scores plot and 2d loadings plot are shown in figure  <dig>  similar to the results from positive mode lc/ms, a clear clustering of data according to age was observed with  <dig> days old rats located between the  <dig> days old and  <dig> days old groups as noted in figure 7a. the ion with m/z  <dig>  at  <dig>  min had the highest contribution to the clustering based on the pca loadings as noted in the loadings plot shown in figure 7b.

all major ions with large contributions to the separation along with their potential atomic compositions and identities are listed in table  <dig>  similar to positive ion analysis, these ions were manually inspected from the raw data through the extracted ion chromatogram in order to assure the 'true' ion signal was detected and the detected mass accuracy. suberic acid  was identified as increased with age based on the accurate mass detection and verification by an authentic standard. ferulic acid sulfate , an important metabolite of ferulic acid, was detected as increased. an ion with m/z  <dig>  at tr  <dig>  was identified as 6-hydroxymelatonin by comparison with a standard. other unidentified ions detected as increased with aging included ions with tr's at  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  min and corresponding m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. identification of these unidentified ions is still ongoing. one negative ion peak at tr  <dig>  min and m/z  <dig>  showed a tendency to decrease over age. a peak at  <dig>  min and m/z  <dig> , identified as citric acid was found to be at a maximum in  <dig> days old sd rats; an observation that was also seen by nmr.

discussion
the urine output, which will vary between animals, will affect the total intensity of each spectrum making it necessary to apply a normalization step to account for any variation prior to statistical analysis. normalization by total intensity of the nmr spectra is generally the preferred method  <cit> . normalization by total intensity is used to compensate for different dilution factors when analyzing urine samples. another common method is to normalize by the internal concentration of creatinine. the creatinine concentration is assumed to be a constant value under conditions where the kidney is functioning normally and normalization by creatinine is intended to account for urine dilution effects. the practice of normalizing clinical parameters by creatinine is still widely used in kidney diagnostics. however, there has been some question as to the validity of correcting by creatinine concentration and specifically whether normalization by creatinine introduces an age-related bias into clinically measured parameters  <cit> . since the amount of food and water consumed by rats is directly correlated and preclinical dosing is often normalized to weight, we evaluated normalization by the weight and by 1/weight for each rat.

in either case where weight was used as a normalization factor, the primary separation in pca was along pc <dig> and due primarily to the differences in animal weight for the three age groups. the average weight for the  <dig> day old group was 430% greater than the average weight for the  <dig> day old group. clearly, normalization by weight introduces a bias that masks other biologically relevant processes. however, if the effects of age alone are of interest, normalizing by animal weight will clearly amplify the age-related effects. the average creatinine concentration also varied with age with a 47% increase between the  <dig> and  <dig> days old groups. creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine, which is a major component of muscle. studies have shown that the urinary creatinine concentration increases in humans as they age and then declines later in life  <cit> . the creatinine concentration is closely correlated with muscle mass and nutritional status. in this case, normalizing the integral data by creatinine is again amplifying the effects of age over any other underlying biological processes.

the investigation of normalization factor indicated that the greater the correlation between normalization factor and age, the greater the separation between the age groups in pca analyses. correlations between age and the normalization factor were determined for comparison. the normalization factor that showed the least age dependence was total nmr intensity with a correlation between age and pc <dig> of - <dig> . the corresponding pca plots based on total intensity normalization also showed the smallest separation between age groups although the three groups were still clearly separated. the pca based on integral bins normalized to creatinine levels had a correlation between age and pc <dig> of  <dig> . the pca of spectra normalized to animal weight had a correlation between age and pc <dig> of  <dig>  while normalization by 1/weight had a correlation between age and pc <dig> of - <dig> . in effect, normalization by creatinine concentration changes each individual spectrum by that factor. for example, a spectral bin that had a high correlation with creatinine concentration before normalization would lose that age-related dependence after normalization. regions of the urine spectra which were unrelated to aging after normalization to total intensity would now have an age-related dependence equivalent to the creatinine age dependence after normalization of the spectra to creatinine. the same principles apply for normalization by to weight and 1/weight. these results indicate that the greater the variation and the higher the correlation of the normalization factor with age, the greater the bias that is introduced into further statistical analysis. since total intensity shows the least change between the three age groups, the bias is minimized. thus, total intensity normalization was utilized for data analysis in this metabonomics study. indeed, result from pca analysis of nmr-based data was consistent with that of lc/ms based data.

in comparing the effects of different compounds from unique studies, it is important to carefully consider how to quantitatively normalize the data. select metabolites from the  <dig> hr urine spectra of  <dig> day old rats in two distinct datasets were quantified and compared. prior to any normalization procedure, obvious variability in the concentrations between the two datasets was noted. the concentrations were expected to be quite similar based upon the fact that the animals used in both studies were the same strain and housed and fed in the same manner. as known, the concentrations obtained by analysis with chenomx nmr suite  are determined relative to the sodium 3-trimethyl-silyl-propionate  concentration within each sample. the tmsp concentration is a value that is defined by the user prior to analysis of the spectrum. however, the effects of tmsp volatility and other factors that may result in variation of the tmsp concentration are not accounted for in determining the concentrations of the metabolites. for example, it was determined that the tmsp concentration differed by a factor of almost two between the two studies, which was not accounted for in the analysis.

initially, the creatinine concentration was used for normalization. however, the creatinine concentration is also reported relative to the tmsp concentration, which was noted above to differ between the studies. further, the creatinine concentration increases slightly with age, which will affect any comparisons between the datasets. concentrations were then normalized by tmsp peak intensity/total spectral intensity. this normalization method takes into account any variation in the tmsp peak concentration between samples and between studies and provided the most consistent results although some variations still exist. the variations noted between the two data sets normalized to tmsp peak intensity/total spectral intensity may be related to other environmental factors like diet. while the two studies were run in the same manner, the samples were collected almost a year apart so the composition of the food could have differed slightly. further, the animals were provided access to water and chow ad libitum so there was no dietary control. regardless, the results indicate that normalization by total spectral intensity and tmsp intensity is more realistic and scientifically-based.

in addition to addressing factors that affect statistical and quantitative analysis, nmr and ms analyses were used to investigate age-related changes in the metabolic profiles at ages  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days. result from pca analysis of nmr data based on total intensity normalization was similar with that from lc/ms data . these observations confirmed that nmr data based on total intensity normalization truly reflected the effects of age over any other underlying biological processes.

comprehensive and complementary metabolic information in aging rats can be obtained with the combination of nmr and uplc/ms, since they possess different principal techniques. nmr data demonstrated that many metabolites associated with the krebs cycle decreased with age while citrate and 2-oxoglutarate, also associated with the krebs cycle, were most elevated in the  <dig> day old animals. nonetheless, the fact that many metabolites in the krebs cycle decreased while a few increased as the rats aged cannot be fully explained by simple dietary or activity changes. normalized levels of creatine were also decreased with age. normalized levels of hippurate, creatinine, and taurine increased when going from  <dig> days to  <dig> days old similar to the results presented by williams and coworkers  <cit> . hippurate is related to the gut microflora level with the increased concentration in the older rats indicating that the gut microflora develops as a rat ages. this trend in hippurate levels has been previously noted  <cit> . age-related increases in taurine levels were also previously observed in a study of wistar rats  <cit> . taurine has been reported as a marker of liver function and the increase in taurine may be related to a decrease in liver function  <cit> . further, taurine has been proposed to provide some protection to tissue against reactive oxygen species   <cit> . serum creatinine is a known marker of renal function that increases in concentration in the urine as renal function decreases  <cit> . the fact that creatinine concentration changes during rat aging makes normalization based on this molecule unsuitable for detecting age related biomarkers.

uplc/ms data collected in positive mode showed that the dimer of hippuric acid had the highest contribution to the age-based clustering based on its pca significance. this result was consistent with the observation in other age-related metabonomics studies  <cit> . the hippuric acid trend plot  shows a lower concentration for the  <dig> days old group relative to the older groups , which had similar concentrations. this is most likely caused by the relative lower total gut microflora content in younger animals. hippuric acid and the ion at m/z  <dig>  were also detected as age-related compounds present in the urine in the study by williams et al.  <cit> . differences in the other ions reported here from those detected by williams and coworkers  <cit>  were most likely due to the fact that different strains of animals  and different ages  were used in the individual studies. as such, hippuric acid and the ion at m/z  <dig>  could be postulated as age-related biomarkers for all strains of rats. suberic acid and ferulic acid sulfate, an important metabolite of ferulic acid, were detected as increased in negative mode uplc/ms spectra. the elevation in ferulic acid may be the result in response to an increased need for antioxidants due to higher levels of reactive oxygen species  that are present as the animal ages. ferulic acid may offer significant health benefits through its antioxidant and anti-cancer activity  <cit> . the ion identified as 6-hydroxymelatonin also increased with age. the presence of higher concentrations of suberic acid in older rats may reveal increased fatty acid oxidation  <cit> , while 6-hydroxymelatonin would support increased antioxidant activity of melatonin. this increase is likely related to increased antioxidant activity of melatonin throughout the aging process.

CONCLUSIONS
this study compared different normalization methods for the nmr-based metabonomics data. it was shown that the method of normalization has a great effect on both the statistical and quantitative analyses. the age-dependent clustering was dependent on the normalization procedure used prior to pca of the nmr integral data. the normalization of nmr data altered the relative position of significant pca loadings but did not alter which chemical shifts and associated metabolites had the highest loadings. the greater the normalization factor was related to age, the greater the separation between age groups was observed in subsequent pca analyses. the normalization factor that showed the least age dependence was total nmr intensity. these results affirm that it is necessary to consider the age of the animal and the best way to normalize data when comparing results from different metabonomics studies.

in addition to investigating the effects of normalization on nmr-based metabonomics data, the age dependence on the composition of metabolites was assessed using both nmr and uplc/ms methods. pca analyses indicated very little time dependence on the nmr and uplc/ms spectra of urine obtained from control sd rats administered saline daily for three days and from pre-dose  animals. however, a significant age-related effect was observed. decreased levels of many kreb's cycle intermediates along with increased levels of oxidized lipids and antioxidants in older sd rats is consistent with current theories about how ros and mitochondrial metabolism play a major role in aging  <cit> . the noted increase of suberic acid, 6-hydroxymelatonin, and ferulic acid sulfate along with nmr detected taurine related to aging could represent a protective mechanism as reactive oxygen species also increase.
