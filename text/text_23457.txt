BACKGROUND
type i interferon-α  has been employed for treatment of patients with some tumors including hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, melanoma, and renal cell cancer  <cit> . the anti-tumor action of ifn-α is mediated at least by induction of apoptosis or inhibition of cell growth  <cit> . however, the detailed molecular mechanism by which ifn-α induces apoptosis remain largely unclear. the interaction of ifn-α with its receptor results in transphosphorylation of receptor-associated janus kinases , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of critical residues on the receptors  <cit> . the activated jak1/tyk <dig> phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription , which in turn translocates to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription  <cit> .

in addition to jak/stat pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinases  including extracellular kinase  <dig> , p38mapks, and c-jun nh2-terminal kinases  are activated in response to ifn-α in some cell types including b lymphoma cells  <cit> . for instance, ifn-α induced prolonged jnk <dig> activation  <cit>  with decreased erk activity, resulting in dysfunction of mitochondrial membrane potential . p38mapk was also activated by ifn-α  <cit> . recent studies have determined that mapks activated by ifn-α receptors  are downstream of several components including protein kinase c   <cit> . the pkc family proteins are divided into three subclasses  <cit> : 1) atypical pkcs , which are activated by phosphatidylserine; 2) conventional pkcs , which are calcium-dependent and activated by diacylglycerol; and 3) the novel pkcs , which are calcium-independent and activated by diacylglycerol. a novel ubiquitously expressed pkc, pkc-δ, is phosphorylated and activated in response to multiple agents including ifn-α  <cit> . the activated pkc-δ mediates apoptosis in some cell types and survival in other cell types  <cit> .

in the present study, we examined whether pkc-δ is involved in the ifn-α-induced apoptosis in daudi b lymphoma and u <dig> myeloma cells. our data clearly indicate that ifn-α-induced pkc-δ signaling leads to activation of jnk <dig> and stat <dig>  these observations would be useful for the development of new treatment modalities of patients by using ifn-α

RESULTS
ifn-α induces phosphorylation of pkc-δ in both daudi b lymphoma and u <dig> myeloma cells
pkc family proteins have multiple effects on both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions  <cit> . the levels of pkc family proteins in daudi b lymphoma cells were determined by western blotting. substantial levels of pkc-α, -δ, and -ι were detected in daudi cells, with minute amounts of pkc-γ and -η . pkc-ε and -λ were almost undetectable. because pkc-δ exerts a pro-apoptotic effect in some cell types  <cit> , we examined whether pkc-δ is involved in ifn-α-mediated apoptosis in human b lymphoma cells.

daudi cells were stimulated with ifn-α for the indicated times, followed by assay by western blotting using an antibody  specific for phospho-pkc-δ  or total pkc-δ. in unstimulated daudi cells, a certain level of pkc-δ phosphorylation was detected, which was increased up to  <dig> h following stimulation with ifn-α . similar to daudi b lymphoma cells, ifn-α induced the pkc-δ phosphorylation in the myeloma cell line u <dig> . these results suggest that ifn-α causes pkc-δ phosphorylation in human b lineage cells.

pkc-δ inhibitor rottlerin prevents ifn-α-induced pkc-δ activation
to examine whether pkc-δ is implicated in the ifn-α-induced activation of jnk, the pkc-δ inhibitor rottlerin was employed. pretreatment of daudi cells with  <dig> μm rottlerin for  <dig> h substantially reduced the ifn-α-induced pkc-δ activation , while rottlerin alone induced a small, but significant level of pkc-δ activation, as assessed by western blotting using mabs specific for phospho-pkc-δ and total pkc-δ. pretreatment with rottlerin showed a tendency to reduce the ifn-α-induced activation of jnk, although the difference was not statistically significant, as revealed by short  and long  forms of pjnk . these results further suggest that ifn-α induces pkc-δ activation.

pkc-delta inhibitor rottlerin reduces ifn-α-induced activation of trail promoter
we have previously demonstrated that jnk signaling is involved in the ifn-α-induced upregulation of trail promoter activity  <cit> . pretreatment with rottlerin prevented the ifn-α-induced trail promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by trail-luc assays . thus, it is proposed that ifn-α induces pkc-δ signaling upregulates trail promoter activity through jnk activation.

ifn-α-induced mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis are reduced in daudi cells overexpressing dominant-negative pkc-δ, while it is partially enhanced in those overexpressing constitutively active pkc-δ

rottlerin has some deleterious effects on mitochondrial function , which was further aggravated by the addition of ifn-α. to further confirm that pkc-δ signaling is required for ifn-α-induced apoptosis in daudi cells, dominant negative  and constitutively active  forms of mutant pkc-δ were employed  <cit> . daudi cells were transfected with dnpkc-δ, capkc-δ, or the control vector alone, followed by incubation with a medium containing hygromycin b. the resultant clones overexpressing dnpkc-δ  or capkc-δ, but not the control, were confirmed to express species of the expected molecular weight, as detected by western blotting using anti-flag mab .

the cell lines overexpressing dnpkc-δ  showed a reduced loss of ΔΨm and percentage of pi positive cells after ifn-α stimulation , while the cells expressing capkc-δ showed an enhanced loss of ΔΨm . even in the unstimulated condition, capkc-δ-overexpressing cells exhibited an increased loss of ΔΨm compared with control vector alone, suggesting that pkc-δ functions as a pro-apoptotic molecule in the ifn-α-induced apoptosis in daudi b lymphoma cells.

ifn-α-induced activation of jnk and trail promoter is partially reduced in daudi cells overexpressing dnpkc-δ
the activities of jnk and the trail promoter in response to ifn-α were examined in dnpkc-δ-overexpressing cells. the ifn-α-induced enhancement of the phosphorylated form of jnk was not detected in the dnpkc-δ-expressing cells, compared with the control vector alone . the ifn-α-induced trail promoter activity was decreased and increased in dnpkc-δ- and capkc-δ-expressing cells, respectively, compared with the control vector alone . flow cytometric analysis showed that the ifn-α-induced increase in trail protein expression on dnpkc-δ-expressing cells was low, compared with control . moreover, jnk inhibitor sp- <dig> reduced the ifn-α-induced trail promoter activity in the capkc-δ-expressing cells . these findings suggest that ifn-α-induced pkc-δ signaling results in jnk activation, leading to trail promoter activation.

ifn-α-induced phosphorylation ser- <dig> of stat <dig> is substantially reduced in dnpkc-δ-expressing cells
ifn-α is known to phosphorylate stat <dig> on the ser <dig> residue in human u <dig> myeloma and human fibroblast cell line  <cit> . the ifn-α-induced phosphorylation  was considerably prevented in the dnpkc-δ-expressing cells relative to control cells . levels of total stat <dig> were increased in both the dnpkc-δ-expressing and the control cells. however, stat <dig> phosphorylation at tyrosine  <dig> was detected at almost comparable levels between dnpkc-δ-expressing and control cells  <dig> h after stimulation with ifn-α. together, ifn-α-induced pkc-δ signaling regulates jnk activation and ser727-stat <dig> phosphorylation, which might affect apoptotic processes.

discussion
ifn-α has been employed for treatment of tumors and viral diseases   <cit> . type i ifn-α exerts multiple functions including anti-viral action, immune modulation, cell proliferation, and cell death  <cit> . ifn-α actions against tumors involve induction of apoptosis as well as indirect effects through induction of cytotoxic cells  <cit> . we have previously demonstrated that ifn-α induced a sustained activation of pro-apoptotic molecule jnks  <cit> , concomitant with upregulation of anti-apoptotic molecule c-flip through nf-κb activation  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of ifn-α-induced apoptotic cell death are not completely understood. in the present study, we explored the upstream component of ifn-α-induced jnk activation and found that pkc-δ activation occurs upstream of jnk and stat <dig> activation.

several studies have demonstrated that pkc-δ has multiple targets in response to apoptotic stimuli, including ifn-α  <cit> . for example, it has been shown that pkc-δ mediates jnk activation in response to dna damage  <cit> . consistent with this observation, genetic silencing of pkc-δ using dnpkc-δ reduced the ifn-α-induced jnk activation , supporting the notion that pkc-δ signaling participates in the ifn-α-induced jnk activation. because pkc-δ did not translate to the nucleus in response to ifn-α , it is unlikely that pkc-δ affects gene expression via transcription factor. rather, downstream component of pkc-δ signaling pathway including jnk may participate in the upregulation of trail promoter activity  <cit> .

the interaction of trail with its receptors trail-rs leads to caspase- <dig> activation through recruitment of adaptor protein fas-associated death domain   <cit> . the caspase- <dig> activation in most cell types is amplified in the mitochondria. the ifn-α-induced loss of ΔΨm and increase in sub-g <dig> fraction was reduced in the dnpkc-δ-overexpressing cells, while the mitochondrial dissipation was enhanced in the capkc-δ-overexpressing cells. pkc-δ inhibitor rottlerin was not suitable for analysis of ifn-α-induced loss of ΔΨm in daudi cells, because rottlerin alone induced mitochondrial dissipation . such rottlerin-induced mitochondrial damage may lead to a small level of pkc-δ activation. thus, the following pathway is proposed for the ifn-α-induced apoptosis: ifn-α induces jnk <dig> activation via pkc-δ → upregulation of trail → interaction of trail with its trail-rs. → loss of ΔΨm → apoptosis. interestingly, a recent report clearly demonstrated that trail induces pkc-δ activation through diacylglycerol in jurkat cells  <cit> , which can form a positive feedback loop involving pkc-δ and trail. alternatively, it is also possible that the activated jnk induces migration of p21bax-α to the mitochondria from cytosol, which is cleaved into p18bax-α, a more potent form  <cit> . these changes lead to loss of ΔΨm, especially in the later phases of apoptotic processes, which is trail-independent  <cit> .

the trail promoter contains a possible ifn-stimulated response element  and ap- <dig> sites  <cit> , which might be involved in trail promoter activation. originally, jnk was found to induce phosphorylation of c-jun, which combines with c-fos, creating a heterodimer of c-jun/c-fos   <cit> . indeed, ifn-α caused ap- <dig> activation in several cell lines including daudi lymphoma cells, probably through jnk activation . the isre binds transcription factor ifn-stimulated gene factor- <dig>  comprising stat <dig>  stat <dig>  and irf- <dig>  <cit> . ifn-α caused phosphorylation of stat <dig> on ser <dig>  at least through pkc-δ signaling  <cit> . we also confirmed the phosphorylation of stat <dig>  in the ifn-α-stimulated daudi cells . the ifn-α-stimulated phosphorylation of stat <dig> on ser <dig>  but not tyr <dig>  was markedly abrogated in the dnpkc-δ-expressing daudi cells, confirming that pkc-δ signaling plays a crucial role in the ser727-pkc-δ phosphorylation. stat <dig> activation favours induction of apoptosis in some settings, whereas ser727-stat <dig> promotes survival in others probably through gene induction  <cit> . experiments are required to address whether ifn-α-induced ser727-stat <dig> functions as proapoptotic or anti-apoptotic molecule.

several kinases phosphorylate and activate pkc-δ following stimulation with ifn-α. for example, tyrosine phosphorylation of pkc-δ on tyr  <dig> was induced by src-tyrosine kinase  <cit> . interestingly, pi3-k and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  <dig>  <cit>  phosphorylated pkc-δ on the thr <dig> residue that is stimulated by ifn-α . it remains unclear what kinases are involved in ifn-α-stimulated phosphorylation of pkc-δ in daudi b lymphoma cells.

stimulation of ifn-α together with chemotherapeutic agents appears to be effective for treatment of cancer patients  <cit> . pkc-δ-jnk signaling pathway is involved in induction of apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . here, we demonstrated that the ifn-α-induced apoptosis also involves pkc-δ-jnk signaling pathway in human daudi b lymphoma cells. concurrent with the activation of pro-apoptotic pathway, we recently demonstrated that ifn-α-induced-pkc-α activation caused upregulation of anti-apoptotic c-flip through nf-κb activation  <cit> . thus, the balance between ifn-α-induced pro-apoptotic  and anti-apoptotic  signaling pathways might determine the cell phenotype. these findings would be valuable for the design of treatment modalities of cancer patients with ifn-α together with or without chemotherapeutic agents.

CONCLUSIONS
ifn-α is known to induce jnk activation leading to upregulation of trail promoter activity. in the present study, we explored the upstream component of jnk activation and found that ifn-α induced pkc-δ signaling caused jnk activation, resulting in induction of trail-mediated apoptosis. in addition, the ifn-α-induced pkc-δ signaling was also involved in stat <dig> phosphorylation on serine  <dig>  which may also affect the cell phenotype. these observations would be useful for the development of new treatment modalities of cancer patients with ifn-α.
