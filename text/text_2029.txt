BACKGROUND
in recent years proteomics has become of great interest in biochemistry. new methods and technologies are constantly being developed  <cit> . qualitative and quantitative proteomics strategies are particularly useful to analyze samples measured under different conditions or samples from different phenotypes. another application was presented by palmblad and deelder  <cit>  who reconstructed the unique correct phylogenetic tree for the great apes and other primates based solely on proteome-wide measurements. furthermore, yilmaz et al.  <cit>  have recently proposed a pipeline for differential proteomics in unsequenced species.

most of the workflows in proteomics nowadays are based on mass spectrometry , replacing 2d gel electrophoresis. a great variety of instruments is being used and refined. dealing with the high complexity of protein or peptide samples, liquid chromatography as separation technique is often combined with mass spectrometry. tandem mass spectrometry, ms/ms, involves at least two stages of mass analysis and an intermediate fragmentation step. ms/ms spectra comprise of detected intensities of occurring masses corresponding to peptide fragments.

the identification of peptides and proteins using ms and ms/ms data is typically performed by database-dependent search algorithms, e.g., with mascot  <cit> . peptide sequences are verified by large and continuously updated databases that are derived from genome sequencing projects. these databases are usually well curated and often manually annotated. however, novel peptides nonexistent in databases cannot be identified with this approach. de novo peptide sequencing algorithms  <cit>  are independent of database searches, but robust error estimation strategies are still lacking.

by omitting the peptide identification step mass spectra from different samples can be directly compared. palmblad and deelder  <cit>  introduced a basic algorithm differentiating between blood samples. two components are required for comparing samples on a proteome-wide scale. first, appropriate distance measures for mass spectra are needed  <cit> . second, the information of thousands of spectra has to be aggregated to compute the global distance between pairwise lc-ms/ms runs.

our main goal is to provide a general method for the comparison of different samples using data of lc-ms/ms runs. as a proof of concept, our new algorithm disms <dig> is applied to real data of lc-ms/ms runs. this includes both known species with established protein databases as well as two organisms with no prior comprehensive genomics and proteomics studies, namely radix and amphistegina, for which only direct spectra comparisons are feasible.

the resulting distances of disms <dig> are compared to a standard database search with mascot evaluating the competitiveness of our flexible approach.

methods
we introduce the new flexible disms <dig> algorithm that calculates explicit distances between pairs of lc-ms/ms runs. first, a collection of  <dig> ms/ms runs from different species is presented. second, a conventional mascot database search as competitive method is explained. third, an overview of appropriate distance measures between single spectra is given. then the algorithm disms <dig> is explained in detail, and finally an approach for parameter optimization for disms <dig> is presented.

samples and lc-ms/ms analysis
proteolytic  digests of five sequenced organisms, i.e.  human ,  mouse ,  yeast ,  roundworm , and  fruit fly  and of four organisms without sequenced genome, i.e.  fresh water snail radix species: molecular operational taxonomic unit   <dig> ,  <dig>  and  foraminifera species amphistegina lessonii , amphistegina gibbosa  were analyzed using an ultimate  <dig> nano rslc system coupled to a q exactive hf mass spectrometer . each sample was measured in triplicate  resulting in a dataset of  <dig> ms/ms runs. the samples were analyzed in randomized order to minimize systematic errors. detailed information about sample preparation and lc-ms/ms analyses is provided in a document about material and methods .

database search
ms data interpretation was conducted using proteome discoverer  <dig>   and mascot  <dig>  . database searches of the five model organisms  were performed in a target/decoy mode against their respective protein sequence  databases . trypsin was selected as enzyme, and two missed cleavage sites were allowed. carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as fixed and oxidation of methionine was set as dynamic modifications. ms and ms/ms tolerances were set to  <dig> ppm and  <dig>  da respectively, and only peptide-to-spectrum matches  with search engine rank  <dig> and a false discovery rate  <1%  were considered.

distance measures
for any ms/ms run i containing n
i ms <dig> spectra define spectrum ski with rank k in run i as a set of two vectors xki and iki with length pki: 
 ski=xki,iki=xki, <dig> …,xki,pki′,iki, <dig> …,iki,pki′ 


the m/z  ratios xki are sorted in ascending order, and corresponding peak intensities are labeled with iki.

according to the resolution of the experiment the range of m/z values can be subdivided into small intervals so that every peak can be assigned to exactly one interval. then an alternative definition of spectrum ski is a vector i~ki=′ with p~ entries, where the entry at a specific position is the peak intensity, if one peak was assigned, and otherwise  <dig> 

the most commonly used distance measure for the pairwise comparison of mass spectra is the cosine distance d
cos  <cit> . for a pair of vectors of intensities i~ki and i~lj, the cosine similarity of the spectra k
i and l
j is the ratio of the dot product and the product of the euclidean norms of the intensity vectors, according to the alternative definition. the cosine distance d
cos is then calculated by subtracting the cosine similarity from 1: 
 dcos=1−i~ki,i~lji~kii~lj=1−∑q=1p~Ĩki,q·Ĩlj,q∑q=1p~Ĩki,q2·∑q=1p~Ĩlj,q <dig> 


depending on preprocessing of the spectra, e.g. only considering the top topn  peaks of each spectrum, a cosine distance that neglects intensities, is appropriate. novak and hoksza  <cit>  have introduced the angle distance, a distance corresponding to cosine distance, with the original spectrum definition given by: 
 dangle=arccos∑q=1pkimaxq∗= <dig> …,plj1xki,q−xlj,q∗≤εpki·plj 


several other distance measures have been discussed, such as pearson’s or spearman’s correlation  <cit> . novak and hoksza  <cit>  have introduced the parametrized hausdorff distance dph=max,h) with 
 h=1pki∑q=1pkiminq∗= <dig> …,pljxki,q−xlj,q∗1xki,q−xlj,q∗>δ1/k. 


given an error tolerance δ, h averages the k-th root of the minimal absolute distance greater than δ of the position of all peaks of spectrum ski compared to all peaks of spectrum slj.

disms2
the pseudo code of our new algorithm disms <dig> is shown in algorithm  <dig>  calculating the pairwise distances of n ms/ms  runs is a four-step procedure, consisting of spectra filtering, checking constraints for matching, matching of ms <dig> spectra, and calculation of the distance matrix with pairwise distances of ms/ms runs. the algorithm has been implemented in the statistical programming language r  <cit> .





the first step is preprocessing and filtering of ms/ms spectra. additionally it can be specified if only peaks of ms <dig> spectra with top topn highest intensities are included in the analysis. then all spectra are binned with a flexible binsize bin. binning with a fixed binsize bin= <dig>  has been applied in comparems <dig>  <cit> . all intensities with m/z ratio x in a small interval [n
∗·bin,·bin)  are replaced by one representative, the maximum intensity at the central m/z ratio value ·bin.

the concept of the procedure is to match all ms/ms spectra in run i with the most similar spectra in run j and vice versa. due to a long computing time and for reasons of content the number of possible matching candidates is reduced by checking three constraints in step  <dig> 

constraints – are checked in the following order. first, only spectra with a similar retention time are considered. the usage of a hplc before ms analysis justifies the constraint of a similar retention time since peptides with the same properties elute from the column at the same time. while retention time alignment is necessary for an optimal analysis, the following method is fast and adequate for filtering. to save computing time, instead of determining a time window the tolerance ret limits the number of ms/ms spectra in run j before and after any ms/ms spectrum in run i by the rank of the scan number. by filtering all candidate spectra with rank l in an interval  for matching with spectrum k in run i, at most 2·ret+ <dig> ms <dig> spectra remain. the tolerance ret can be increased to ensure that no best matching spectra are missed.

although mass to charge ratios are displayed to allow for comparisons of spectra with different charge states, spectra might look different due to different properties. for this reason constraint  guarantees that only matches of spectra with the same precursor charge state are considered. again the number of possible candidates is reduced.

apparently peptides with the same amino acid sequences and the same post-translational modifications have same masses. this leads to constraint  allowing only the comparison of spectra with similar precursor masses. for any spectrum k in run i with precursor mass mki only spectra l of run j inside a small interval mki·,mki· are considered. this ensures a maximum precursor mass accuracy of prec ppm : |/mki|·106≤prec. if no spectrum of run j fulfills all constraints for spectrum k in run i, no match is available. then spectrum k is assigned a distance greater than a threshold cdis.

finally in step  <dig> sequentially for each spectrum k in run i distances dist to all remaining candidate spectra in run j are calculated. as mentioned above several appropriate distance measures can be chosen, for example the most commonly used cosine distance d
cos, the angle distance d
angle, or the parametrized hausdorff distance d
ph. depending on the chosen distance measure dist a binary cut-off threshold cdis for a hit, i.e. same or different spectrum, has to be fixed. for the cosine distance d
cos palmblad and deelder  <cit>  have shown that cdis= <dig>  is a reasonable choice. a distance d
∗ between runs i and j is the frequency of spectra in run i with no match  in run j. match means that the spectrum in run j with smallest distance dist is considered and this minimal distance is smaller than cdis. the distance d
∗ is not symmetric because the process is directed. thus the procedure is repeated with exchanged runs i and j and finally the mean d=+d
∗)/ <dig> of the directed distances is calculated. n· directed distances d
∗ have to be calculated to fill the distance matrix d.

parameter optimization for disms2
in our new algorithm disms <dig> several parameters have to be set and therefore an appropriate parameter optimization is needed. given the data as mentioned above, a distance matrix between runs with size 27× <dig> is computed using disms <dig>  distances within groups of technical replicates of organisms should be smaller than distances between different organisms. however, due to the random selection of precursor ions for ms/ms analysis, data dependent acquisition  is biased to the most abundant peptides present in a complex sample. further, in dda mode the intra-sample variation of peptide identifications between technical replicates is high   <cit> . for this reason, an anova like approach for distance matrices, adonis , is used for evaluation. anderson  <cit>  has introduced this non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance which is applicable for a distance matrix explaining different sources of variation. variations of distances are divided into two parts, one representing variation of technical replicates within species and the other variation between species. a permutation test  with pseudo-f ratio between the mean sum of squares of distances between and within species is used. as goodness-of-fit measure the partial r-squared between groups of technical replicates, i.e. the ratio of sum of squares of distances between species and the sum of squares of all distances, is used. values close to  <dig> are desired.

RESULTS
first, the application of the new algorithm disms <dig> on real data is presented in detail, including data preprocessing and choice of parameters. second, disms <dig> is compared to a common mascot database search . finally, distances between species are visualized by dendrograms using average linkage hierarchical clustering.

application of disms <dig> on real data with parameter optimization
we implemented disms <dig> in r  <cit>  and applied it on  <dig> ms/ms runs to compare samples of human, mouse, yeast, roundworm, fruit fly, two different radix species and two different foraminifera species. the proteowizard tool msconvertgui  <cit>  was used to convert thermo raw files into mzxml files. the open data format mzxml can be read with the r package readmzxmldata  <cit> .

to find appropriate parameter settings in disms <dig> we used a full factorial design. due to time and memory costs the number of parameter combinations was limited. the values of factor levels in design  <dig> were set according to preliminary investigations and expert advice . especially the accepted precursor mass shift prec is set constant . since the angle distance is not bounded in the interval , in design  <dig> more factors were added with higher values for the cutoff cdis. in total  <dig> factor combinations were compared by means of the partial r squared as goodness of fit measure, based on adonis, an anova like approach for distance matrices.

we requested 3gb ram on one core of an eight-core intel xeon e5- <dig> . the median runtime of disms <dig> for  <dig> ms/ms runs for one of in total  <dig> factor combinations  is  <dig>  hrs . for the best ranked setting   <dig>  hrs are needed. the use of constraints  –  in step  <dig> of algorithm  <dig>  especially an appropriate choice of retention time tolerance ret, drastically reduces the runtime of disms <dig>  increasing ret for the best ranked setting from  <dig> to  <dig> leads to a runtime of more than  <dig> hrs, an increase by a factor of  <dig> . removing all constraints would result in a dramatic runtime increase in the range of  <dig> years. the use of constraints leads to a small number of candidates for matches. in case of h <dig> and h <dig>  for example, on average only  <dig>  out of more than  <dig> candidates remain.

to quantify the influence of the parameters a regression tree was constructed . the choice of the distance measure has the highest influence. the cosine distance outperforms d
ph and d
angle. still, the parametrized hausdorff distance is competitive when a higher cutoff is chosen.
fig.  <dig> regression tree fitted to explain the partial r-squared  based on combinations of parameter settings. different parameter settings of topn, bin, ret, dist, and cdis were used. each node displays the average partial r-squared in the node  and the number of observations that fall in the node . classification was performed using the statistical programming language r, r package rpart  <cit> 




the impact of the choice of a distance measure for spectra is shown in fig.  <dig> illustrating two similar and two diverse spectra, respectively. the value of the angle distance in case of two similar spectra is almost as large as the value of the cosine distance in case of two distinct spectra.

comparison of disms <dig> with state of the art database search
to evaluate the quality of disms <dig> we compared it to database search algorithms. disms <dig> requires a filter check, whereas database search requires an annotation check. we analyzed several methods combining algorithmic steps in different ways, see table  <dig> for a list of all compared algorithms.



for all algorithms we calculated the average relative number of no hits of a directed search. the general principle is that a list of spectra associated with an ms/ms run is compared one by one with a second list of candidate spectra associated with a second ms/ms run. the algorithms differ in the definition of a hit, the spectrum universe, possible annotation and filter checks, and potential removal of duplicates.

search method database means that a hit is counted if in the list of candidate spectra the same peptide is annotated. for the search method distance a hit means that the distance between the spectrum and a candidate spectrum is smaller than cdis =  <dig> .

the spectrum universe is the union of all ms/ms spectra in respective runs. if all spectra are included in the analysis complete runs are used. a reduced spectrum universe stands for a selection of ms/ms spectra with peptide annotations.

annotation check means that for matching candidates both spectra have to be annotated by a mascot peptide-to-spectrum-match. possibly matching candidates are downgraded as no hit. for about  <dig> to 60% of all spectra  peptide hits are missing, i.e. the database search with mascot resulted in no hit, meeting a 1% fdr criterion.

filtering means that for matching candidates the constraints for retention time, precursor mass and charge state have to be fulfilled .

usually duplicated peptide annotations are kept meaning that all spectra are considered in the spectrum universe. removing duplicates  of peptide annotations means that a hitlist of all peptides annotated at least once is used.

we now describe all compared algorithms listed in table  <dig>  the methods disms <dig> f and db.ra are the default versions. disms <dig> f uses filtering and considers all spectra, whereas db.ra uses no filtering and considers only spectra that are annotated with a peptide sequence. in db.ra.nodup, additionally multiple spectra annotated with the same peptide are replaced by one representative .

search method distance is associated with a filter check whereas search method database includes an annotation check. the differences between disms <dig> f and db.a are only the annotation check and the filter check. all spectra are included in the spectrum universe of db.a, in contrast to db.ra with a reduced universe.

for a meaningful comparison we also considered two algorithms with both filtering and annotation checks. including all ms/ms spectra in the spectrum universe, disms <dig> af and db.af only differ by the search method.

the mean distances of runs are computed for all methods between and within species, as shown in table  <dig> and in fig.  <dig>  in table s <dig>  the total number of ms/ms spectra for different species comparisons is shown in detail. corresponding standard errors indicating variations of technical replicates are negligibly small, see table s <dig> . in comparisons within species standard errors are smaller than  <dig> , and between species at most  <dig> .
fig.  <dig> mean relative number of partners for different ways of proteome comparisons methods. steps of search method, spectrum universe, annotation check, filter check and potential removal of duplicates in different ways between  and within  species of roundworm , fruit fly , human , mouse  and yeast  are compared


for different ways of proteome comparisons methods steps of search method, spectrum universe, annotation check, filter check and potential removal of duplicates between are combined. mean distances of runs between  and within  species of roundworm , fruit fly , human , mouse  and yeast  are shown




the mean distances are small within species and large between species. db.ra and db.ra.nodup generate smaller values, followed by disms <dig> f. db.a is not able to keep up. largest distances are generated for db.af and disms <dig> af. it should be noted that the exact composition of peptides of analyzed samples is unknown as database annotation might be incorrect or incomplete. thus the interpretation of larger or smaller values might be imprecise.

for the algorithms db.ra and db.ra.nodup the distances are calculated based on a reduced spectrum universe so that many spectra with low quality have been removed. thus it is expected that many spectra without annotation implying large distances are removed, which leads to smallest values within species smaller than 20% in table  <dig> 

since db.af uses the same filtering as disms <dig> af, results are directly comparable. annotation and filtering checks reduce the number of possible matches. as aforementioned missing annotations in list  <dig> have a share of  <dig> to 60%. furthermore for  <dig> to 13%  and  <dig> to 50%  of all spectra no candidate spectra are remaining that fulfill all filtering requirements and are annotated .

in case of same annotated peptides the cosine distance is typically small, see fig.  <dig>  with the distribution of the cosine distance of ms/ms spectra for two human samples , with mode near  <dig>  however, if the peptide annotation of the matching spectrum is different, the situation differs . most of the distances are high as one might expect. only a few values are smaller than  <dig> . in these cases very similar spectra are marked as different by the annotation approach, possibly due to missing or wrong hits. cosine distance as a binary classifier for same or different peptides is a good choice. the roc curve  displays the performance, plotting the true positive rate  against the false positive rate  for different thresholds cdis. the area under the curve is  <dig>  indicating a good performance. for the chosen threshold cdis= <dig>  we obtain tpr= <dig> % and fpr= <dig> %.

the commonly used method db.ra.nodup differs from the other methods because duplicated measured peptides are weighted different. the mean distance within species of the usual peptide list comparison db.ra.nodup is about  <dig> percent, disms <dig> f based on all spectra leads to little higher values of about  <dig> percent.

most of the comparisons between different species yield values above 90%, except the comparison of human and mouse samples. again db.ra leads to smallest values , followed by db.ra.nodup  and disms <dig> f .

for the comparison of two methods we first calculated the absolute differences of proteome distances between the two methods and then the coefficient of variation  of these values, i.e. the ratio of standard deviation and mean .  <dig> a value smaller than  <dig>  indicates a relevant difference between the corresponding two methods. in most cases there are relevant differences. only disms <dig> af and db.af perform very similar, since cvs are relatively large, some of them considerably larger than  <dig> .

the filtering check is needed for the search method distance to speed up the computing time. exemplary for the two human samples h <dig> and h <dig> disms <dig> is computed without filtering check. the results for all methods applied to these two samples in table  <dig> show that disms <dig> without filtering is competitive even to the database methods with reduced spectrum universe.

visualization of distances between species
dendrograms using average linkage hierarchical clustering were used as trees to illustrate distances between ms/ms runs of different samples and its technical replicates. in average linkage clustering the mean distance between all pairs of elements is used for fusion of clusters.

the first dendrogram visualizes the distance matrix constructed with disms <dig> f for all  <dig> ms/ms runs . the average distance between technical replicates is about 30%. nodes connecting mouse and human samples  as well as two radix species  and foraminifera species  indicate high similarity.

cos and cdis =  <dig> 




further dendrograms  are generated for the other methods for all  <dig> samples with available database annotations. the distance matrix for db.af is almost identical to the one to disms <dig> af , with notably less separation between species.

CONCLUSIONS
disms <dig> is a new user-friendly algorithm implemented in r for the proteome-wide distance calculation of different ms/ms runs. it performs well with data from different organisms, if parameter optimization is performed. measuring technical replicates is the basis for selecting suitable parameters, based on an anova like approach. alternatively, prior knowledge can be used to choose adequate parameters. we carefully compared disms <dig> f  with a state of the art method, the database search mascot db.a. whereas disms <dig> f uses a filtering step that requires to set a critical distance c
d
i
s, db.a suffers from the large number of missing database hits. for a fair comparison, disms <dig> af and db.af use the same spectrum universe of all spectra and perform annotation and filtering checks in the same way. a crucial difference is the different handling of duplicated spectra that are often neglected in database search methods. thus a future goal is to perform clustering of spectra  before matching of partners, in order to further improve disms <dig> and make it directly comparable to the standard db.ra.nodup. a huge benefit of disms <dig> is its applicability to samples from species without database annotation, as demonstrated on the fresh water snail radix species   <dig> and 4) and on the foraminifera amphistegina
lessonii and gibbosa. further, when performing database searches in closely related species or applying de novo approaches disms <dig> can help to validate the results.
