BACKGROUND
the wasp/scar family of proteins are key regulators of actin polymerisation, connecting signalling molecules to the activation of the arp2/ <dig> complex. scar/wave proteins, in particular, play an important role in the regulation of actin dynamics at the leading edges of moving cells. biochemical studies in a range of organisms demonstrate that scar/wave is found in a 1:1:1:1: <dig> complex with four other proteins   <cit> . it is becoming clear, in particular from studies in dictyostelium, that individual components of the complex regulate scar through different signalling pathways and that some may also have additional scar independent functions in vivo.  <cit>  most evidence now suggests that all members of the complex are needed for the correct localisation and function of scar  <cit> .

the smallest scar complex member, hspc <dig>  ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids in length, giving a size of between  <dig> and  <dig> kda. surprisingly little is known about its contribution to scar complex function and stability, perhaps because of the experimental difficulty associated with its smallness. several studies investigating the function of the plant hspc <dig> homologue, brick <dig>  have found that is plays a crucial role in cytoskeletal remodelling. maize brick <dig> null mutations lead to defects in the localisation of cortical actin in dividing and expanding leaf epidermal cells. these cells fail to undergo specific shape changes in preparation for asymmetric cell division  <cit> . arabidopsis hspc <dig> has been shown to be needed for scar complex stability, yet others have demonstrated in vitro that hspc <dig> is not fundamental for the formation of the complex  <cit> . hspc <dig> has also been shown to be important in the drosophila nervous system, in which disruption of hspc <dig> leads to a similar phenotype seen in other scar complex mutants  <cit> .

in this work we characterise the dictyostelium hspc <dig> gene, and assess the consequences of its disruption.

RESULTS
dictyostelium hspc300
the dictyostelium hspc <dig> gene was first identified using a blast search against the dictyostelium genome sequence using the human protein sequence as a bait  <cit> . this search identified dictybase reference ddb <dig>  which encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids and  <dig>  kda. dictyostelium hspc <dig>  human hspc <dig> and arabidopsis brick <dig> are aligned in figure 1a. the central 54aa of the dictyostelium protein is 50% identical and 81% similar to human hspc <dig>  and 46% identical and 75% similar  to arabidopsis brick <dig>  the human and arabidopsis proteins have dissimilar n-termini, and the human hspc <dig> has a significant, unconserved c-terminal extension. like the other members of the dictyostelium scar complex, hspc <dig> is encoded by a single gene, and no other dictyostelium genes were found to be significantly similar to known hspc <dig> homologues  <cit> .

hspc <dig> is required for scar protein stability
in a range of species, removal of one scar complex member  leads to breakdown of others, apparently by posttranslational proteolysis  <cit> . in dictyostelium, pira and napa mutants contain barely detectable full length scar protein despite normal mrna levels  <cit> . in the same fashion, disruption of hspc <dig> also leads to complete loss of scar- as shown in figure 1b, western blots show no detectable scar protein. as seen in other mutants, scar mrna levels in hspc <dig> null and wild type cells are comparable , implying that the reduction in scar protein is a result of posttranslational processes such as degradation. however, pir <dig> levels are insensitive to the loss of hspc <dig> . this insensitivity is also seen when dictyostelium scar or abi are lost  <cit> , but loss of dictyostelium nap <dig> causes an approximate halving of pir <dig> levels  <cit> . taken together these results show that the mechanisms that regulate proteolytic breakdown affect different subunits of the complex independently. the pir <dig> and nap <dig> subunits appear to form a stable subcomplex that is preserved without scar, abi or hspc <dig> , whereas scar is broken down in the absence of any other complex subunit.

hspc <dig> is a part of the scar complex
as predicted from other organisms dictyostelium hspc <dig> forms part of the complete scar complex. a previous in vitro study  <cit>  showed that in vitro translated abi and hspc <dig> bind to the n-terminus of scar, but did not analyze the complex from living dictyostelium. we expressed an n-terminally myc-tagged hspc <dig> or untagged control in hspc <dig> null cells from an extrachromosomal plasmid, which resulted in a restoration of normal scar protein levels . in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-myc antibody, myc-tagged hspc <dig> coprecipitated with endogenous pir <dig> and scar . in other dictyostelium scar complex mutants , pir <dig> is not recruited to the leading edge of actin protrusions as it is in wild type  <cit> . the hspc <dig> null cells also fail to recruit pir <dig> to the edge of actin pseudopods , suggesting that the proposed rac-binding site in pir <dig> – which has not been verified in dictyostelium – is not alone sufficient for localisation .

hspc <dig> is needed for efficient cell motility
in some dictyostelium scar complex mutants , scar protein levels are diminished but the phenotype is not as severe as a complete scar disruption  <cit> . this suggests that some scar functions can be preserved in the absence of an intact complex. to determine if hspc <dig> is needed for scar function we observed wild type , scar null  and hspc <dig> null  mutants migrating towards a stimulus, folate, under a thin layer of agar   <cit> . wild type cells extended a number of large protrusions while migrating and move quickly in the direction of the stimulus. cells lacking scar and hspc <dig> both looked equally smaller and more rounded. these mutants can still initiate and protrude protrusions but these extensions are smaller compared to those extended by wild type cells. the speed of the mutant cells lines was measured from the movies using imagej and compared to the speed of wild type cells . cells lacking hspc <dig> and scar are significantly slower than wild type cells, but not significantly different from one another. the expression of a myc-tagged hspc <dig> or an untagged control in hspc <dig> null cells restored wild type migration in the under-agar assay . similarly, cells lacking hspc <dig> looked indistinguishable from cells lacking scar when f-actin was stained with phalloidin  – both contained less overall f-actin and fewer actin structures. the observations that f-actin, speed of migration and morphology of cells lacking either scar or hspc <dig> are indistinguishable from one another suggest that the contribution of scar to migration has been entirely lost in hspc <dig> null cells.

hspc <dig> is not required for growth
scar is not needed for dictyostelium growth, though it appears to aid efficient phagocytosis  <cit> . a difference is seen in arabidopsis studies in which the control of pavement cell size is dependent on brick <dig> but not scar  <cit> . the authors suggest that this maybe due to hspc <dig> having additional roles independent of scar. to determine if hspc <dig> is important for any aspect of normal growth, growth curves were plotted for wild type and hspc <dig> null cells . hspc <dig> null cells have a population doubling time of approximately  <dig> hours. this is very similar to the estimated population doubling time of wild type cells. somewhat unexpectedly, when grown on klebsiella lawns, hspc <dig> null colonies are only slightly smaller than wild type, and retain the wild type morphology with a defined leading edge . scar null colonies are extremely small and have an extremely narrow feeding front. we therefore find no evidence that hspc <dig> has functions outside of the scar complex, but the less severe phenotype on lawns could perhaps result from a small amount of residual scar activity in the absence of hspc <dig>  this seems similar to dictyostelium cells lacking abi, in which residual scar activity is responsible for the phenotype  <cit> .

hspc <dig> and development
neither scar nor hspc <dig> null cells have obvious developmental defects . when developed on filters these mutants form morphologically normal fruiting bodies which cannot be easily distinguished from wild type fruiting bodies. this is surprising considering that multiple aspects of cell movement, adhesion and contractility are required for multicellular development, and that in other organisms the loss of scar leads to severe developmental defects  <cit> . developed cells moving towards camp behave similarly to vegetative nc4a <dig> moving towards folate  – the cells are slower and pseudopods are smaller, but movement and chemotaxis are remarkably robust. we believe that aggregating dictyostelium cells, like many others, have multiple mechanisms to drive migration. one clear candidate is based on protrusion of blebs  <cit> , and there may be others. mutants in members of the scar complex can presumably aggregate using these.

as development was not greatly affected by the loss of hspc <dig> we investigated slug behaviour in the hspc <dig> null cells to see if there were any subtle differences during this stage of development. wild type slugs will phototax effectively towards a single point source of light when allowed to develop in the dark . hspc <dig> and scar null slugs were still capable of migrating towards the light source but not to the same extent as wild type slugs. the lengths of the tracks trailing the slugs were analysed using imagej . although significantly shorter than wild type slug trails, hspc <dig> and scar null tracks were found to be very similar in length. thus during phototaxis, as in most other conditions, hspc <dig> is required for scar function as the loss of hspc <dig> results in a scar null phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that hspc <dig> is a vital component of the dictyostelium scar complex. unlike dictyostelium abi and pir <dig>  hspc <dig> seems to be fully required for most scar functions, though phagocytosis may be better in hspc <dig> than in scar knockouts, raising the possibility that scar's role in phagocytosis does not require hspc <dig>  we found no evidence that hspc <dig> has roles outside the scar complex, as has been suggested in arabidopsis. although this small protein is vital for the stability of the scar complex it remains unclear what its physiological role may be, and why such a small protein is required physiologically if its only role is as a partner for scar.
