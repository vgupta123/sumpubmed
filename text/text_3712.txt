BACKGROUND
quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction  is an efficient, sensitive and reliable technique to quantify transcript expression levels. qrt-pcr is fast, easy to use and provides simultaneous measurement of gene expression in many different samples for a limited number of genes  <cit> . qrt-pcr has various applications, such as clinical diagnostics  <cit> , analysis of tissue-specific gene expression in humans  <cit> , and gene expression studies in plants  <cit> . appropriate normalisation is very important for quantification of transcript expression levels. the most accepted approach to quantification is normalisation of the expression level of a gene of interest  to the expression level of an internal stably expressed gene   <cit> . the control gene, often termed reference gene, is a stably expressed gene that is experimentally verified in given species and tissues under given experimental conditions  <cit> . by normalising the transcript expression level of a target gene to the expression level of a reference gene, differences in the quality or quantity of template rna and differences in efficiencies of the reverse transcription reaction between samples are accounted for. this allows the direct comparison of normalised transcript expression levels between samples. however, this approach requires the selection of at least one reference gene for validation of a corresponding qrt-pcr method.

this case study illustrates the use of qrt-pcr for improving inulin production in chicory. chicory  is an important crop for inulin production. inulin is a group of naturally occurring polysaccharides that are produced by many types of plants including jerusalem artichoke  and chicory  <cit> . inulin is widely used as an ingredient in functional foods, and there is growing interest in food and non-food industries to make new compounds from inulin and its derivatives  <cit> . currently, chicory is the only plant species used on an industrial scale for the commercial extraction of inulin  <cit> . investigation of the expression level of genes encoding enzymes involved in the inulin biosynthesis and degradation pathway will enable breeders to improve inulin content. this case study illustrates the use of qrt-pcr in chicory using the fructan 1-exohydrolaseii a, 1-fehiia , and fructan 1-exohydrolaseiib, 1-fehiib  genes involved in the inulin degradation pathway. the encoded enzymes are believed to catalyse fructan depolymerisation at the end of the growing season, as well as during storage and forcing of tubers and tuberous roots  <cit> .

up to now, northern blot analysis has been the favoured means of studying the expression of the genes involved in the inulin biosynthesis and degradation pathway  <cit> . northern blotting requires a relatively high amount of rna, and it is laborious and time-consuming  <cit> . further, in certain cases, the expression of low-expressed genes may be below the detection limit of northern blotting. a more sensitive and efficient method, such as qrt-pcr, is thus desirable  <cit> . this requires selection of appropriate reference genes for normalisation. only actin- <dig> has been used as a reference gene for qrt-pcr in chicory  <cit> , and a full comparison of several candidate reference genes in chicory has not yet been reported. taken together, the aims of this study are i) to rank the candidate reference genes according to expression stability across chicory root and leaf tissues using three different methods for expression stability measurements, ii) to develop and evaluate qrt-pcr methods for these genes in chicory, iii) to select appropriate reference genes to use for normalisation of gene expression by qrt-pcr in chicory and iv) to demonstrate their usefulness in qrt-pcr by analysing the expression level of fructan 1-exohydrolaseii, 1-fehii  in chicory root and leaf tissues, as an example for the genes involved in inulin accumulation.

RESULTS
selection of candidate reference genes and primer design
we selected seven candidate reference genes to validate and develop a qrt-pcr method in chicory, including nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase   <cit> , actin   <cit> , Î²-tubulin   <cit> , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase   <cit> , histone h <dig>   <cit> , elongation factor 1-alpha   <cit>  and 18s rrna   <cit> . for all selected genes except gapdh, chicory transcript sequences are available in genbank to design qrt-pcr primers . based on the arabidopsis thaliana gapdh sequence  a primer pair  was designed that amplified a  <dig> bp fragment from chicory genomic dna. this fragment was cloned and sequenced. tblastx analysis revealed that this fragment contains an  <dig> bp region that has at least 89% identity at the amino acid level to gapdh genes across the plant kingdom. we subsequently designed a qrt-pcr primer pair to amplify a  <dig> bp amplicon covering this region from chicory gapdh.

*s.d, standard deviation; **r <dig>  correlation coefficient of the slope of the standard curve

because the nucleotide sequences of chicory fehiia and fehiib transcripts are 94% identical  <cit> , it was not possible to design qrt-pcr primers that could differentiate between the two transcripts. we thus designed a primer pair to amplify a specific region of both fehiia and fehiib . the primer pair was designed to cross the exon5/ <dig> junction of fehiia , excluding the possibility that amplification occurs from any genomic dna contamination. in this case, we studied fehii expression as the combined expression of fehiia and fehiib transcripts in qrt-pcr.

verification of amplicons, primer specificity, cp data collection and gene-specific pcr amplification efficiency
agarose gel electrophoresis  and melting curve analysis  revealed that all primer pairs amplified a single pcr product with the expected size. furthermore, sequence analysis of cloned amplicons revealed that all sequenced amplified fragments were identical or nearly identical  to the sequences used for primer design from genbank, except h <dig>  which showed an  <dig> bp difference in the middle of the amplicon. real-time rt-pcr was conducted on the  <dig> samples with eight primer pairs. to reveal the differences in transcript expression levels between studied genes, the average crossing point cycle number  value was calculated across all leaf and root samples of five individual plants . use of equal amounts of cdna raised different values from real-time pcr amplification. as expected, the average cp value varies between the different genes. rrna was the most abundant  reference transcript while gapdh was the least abundant . a standard curve using a dilution series of the cloned amplicons  was made to calculate the gene-specific pcr efficiency. the correlation coefficient  of the slope of the standard curve used to calculate gene specific pcr amplification efficiency , and pcr efficiency including standard deviation , of all selected genes are listed in table  <dig>  the pcr amplification efficiency for the various pcr methods varied between  <dig> % and  <dig> % .

expression stability of candidate reference genes
three different software programmes were used to calculate the expression stability of the candidate reference genes: genorm  <cit> , normfinder  <cit>  and bestkeeper  <cit> . to find stably expressed genes, we first assayed gene expression stability across leaf and root tissues . cp data were collected for all selected tissues of each plant. these data were either used directly for stability calculations  or were first transformed to relative quantities using the delta-ct method and the gene-specific amplification efficiency implemented in qbase .

a) genorm analysis
average expression stability  of all genes was calculated by genorm . the m values of the candidate reference genes across chicory leaf and root tissues are shown in table  <dig>  genorm recommends using an m value below the threshold of  <dig>  to identify  reference genes with stable expression. the three genes act, ef, and rrna had the highest expression stability in leaf and root tissues . h <dig> and tub had intermediary m values that are still below the threshold of  <dig> . nadhd and gapdh had m values higher then  <dig> , indicating less stable expression across leaf and root tissues . to determine the optimal number of reference genes, genorm calculates the pairwise variation vn/vn+1between two sequential normalisation factors nfn and nfn+ <dig> that contain an increasing number of reference genes. a large variation means that the added gene has a significant effect on the normalisation and should preferably be included for calculation of a reliable normalisation factor. ideally, extra reference genes are included until the variation vn/vn+ <dig> drops below a given threshold. vandesompele and colleagues recommended a threshold of  <dig> , although this threshold should not be viewed as too strict of a cut-off  <cit> . in our data sets, the calculated nfn at increasing numbers of reference genes shows that the inclusion of the third, fourth and fifth genes  still contribute significantly to the variation of the normalisation factor . nadhd and gapdh had m values higher then  <dig> , suggesting that they should not be included in the normalisation factor .

b) normfinder analysis
the stability value of each gene was calculated by normfinder . genes that are more stably expressed are indicated by lower average expression stability values. the analysis ranks act, ef, rrna and h <dig> as the four most stable genes . thus, both genorm and normfinder rank the same four genes as the most stable and the entire order is identical. both analyses rank gapdh as the least stable gene.

c) bestkeeper analysis
bestkeeper analysis determines the most stably expressed genes based on the coefficient of correlation  to the bestkeeper index , which is the geometric mean of cp values of candidate reference genes. variations of gene expression, displayed as the standard deviation of the cp values, were determined. bestkeeper analysis revealed that h <dig> is the gene with the lowest overall variation, and gapdh with the highest, from the list of selected genes with an s.d of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the stability value of individual genes was calculated by bestkeeper based on the pairwise correlation between genes and bi . the bestkeeper revealed that the best correlations were obtained for rrna , act , ef  and tub  with p value of  <dig>  . gapdh is ranked as the fifth stable gene but it has the highest s.d. h <dig> and nadhd are ranked as the least stable genes.

n, number of samples; cp, crossing point cycle number equivalent terminology for ct; gm, the geometric mean of cp; s.d , cp standard deviation; cv , variance coefficient expressed as percentage of cp level; bi, bestkeeper index.

in conclusion, the three most stable reference genes commonly identified by the three different analysis methods are act, ef, and rrna. gapdh ranks fifth according to bestkeeper, or seventh according to genorm and normfinder.

evaluation of expression ratios of candidate reference genes
the ef and gapdh were respectively selected as stable and relatively unstable reference genes to show their expression ratios when normalised by act in  <dig> samples including l1-1/ <dig>  r1-1/ <dig>  r1-1/ <dig>  r2-1/ <dig> and r2-1/ <dig> cdnas . the expression pattern of ef normalised to act illustrates the relatively stable expression ratio of these genes across the leaf and root tissues . the expression patterns of gapdh normalised against act show that the expression levels are more variable . in particular, these results reveal the relatively low level of gapdh expression in the r <dig> samples in three out of five independent plants. this illustrates the reduced expression stability of the gapdh gene in the sample set.

application of the qrt-pcr protocol to evaluate the expression of fructan exohydrolase ii in chicory leaf and root tissues
to demonstrate the usefulness of the validated candidate reference genes in qrt-pcr, we analysed the expression of fehii across leaf and root tissues . the relative expression level of fehii in leaf and root tissues was calculated in qbase using the two best reference genes  for normalisation . expression analysis shows that, in general, fehii transcript expression was detected in all tissues in the five individual plants investigated, except for four cases . as expected, the highest levels of fehii expression were observed in the mature root tissues . fehii was generally expressed at a very low level in green leaves  and root tips . among the leaf samples, the highest-fold change in expression is  <dig>  between wt5l1-1/ <dig> and wt4l1-1/ <dig> and the lowest-fold change is  <dig>  between wt3l1-1/ <dig> and wt4l1-1/ <dig>  among the r <dig> tissues, the highest-fold change is  <dig>  between wt5r2-1/ <dig> and wt2r2-1/ <dig> and the lowest-fold change is  <dig>  between wt4r2-1/ <dig> and wt2r2-1/ <dig>  these analyses show the biological variation in fehii transcript expression among the studied tissues and between individual plants of the same cultivar. these expression results are consistent with fehii transcript analysis by northern blot as reported by van den ende and colleagues  <cit> , who demonstrated that the expression of fehii was highly abundant in roots. the current study also suggests that qrt-pcr analysis makes it possible to detect and quantify low levels of fehii expression in leaf tissue.

next, we examined the effect of choosing a reference gene with relatively low expression stability across the target tissues. to this end, the expression of fehii using gapdh as a reference gene was calculated. in comparison with normalisation of fehii data against act/ef the overall expression profile appears similar , but marked changes are introduced in individual samples. for instance, relatively low expression of gapdh in r <dig> tissues of wt <dig>  wt <dig> and wt <dig>  leads to overestimation of fehii expression in the respective samples. in wt <dig>  the r <dig> sample has the lowest fehii expression compared to l and r <dig>  if expression is normalised using act and ef. in contrast, fehii expression in the r <dig> sample appears much higher than l and r <dig> if expression is normalised against gapdh. a similarly strong apparent increase is observed for the r <dig> samples in wt <dig> and wt <dig> when expression is normalised against gapdh.

reproducibility of the cdna synthesis  was assessed using the best normalisation factor . the similarity between the two observations of each root sample per individual plant reveals high reproducibility between independent cdna syntheses for the root tissues. in contrast, reproducibility appears to be much lower, especially in the r <dig> samples, when fehii expression is normalised against gapdh, as compared to normalisation against act and ef. this effect is clearly due to low stability of gapdh expression across samples. this illustrates the adverse effect of an unsuitable reference gene.

discussion
qrt-pcr has become a valuable tool for accurate gene expression profiling in addition to northern blotting  <cit> . qrt-pcr is a rapid, accurate and sensitive technique for relative quantification of transcript expression levels and requires a relatively low amount of rna. quantification of gene expression is affected by several factors, including experimental sources of variation and the normalisation method. various experimental sources of variation exist in qrt-pcr, such as sample-to-sample variation in rna integrity, differences in reverse transcriptase reaction efficiency and the amount of cdna template used in each pcr reaction. normalisation of the expression level of a target gene against a stably expressed internal gene can compensate for all these kinds of variations and results in the relative quantification of gene expression levels across samples  <cit> . moreover, correct and accurate sample normalisation is required to reveal small but significant differences in expression when comparing samples from different organs or tissues. the accuracy of the results obtained by qrt-pcr therefore strongly depends on the choice of one, or preferably more, reference genes that are stably expressed across all tissues or organ samples  <cit> .

some genes, such as act, ubiquitin  <dig> , glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase , gapdh, ribosomal genes, cyclophilin, ef andalpha-tubulin  are commonly used housekeeping genes for gene expression studies in many plant species  <cit> . however, recent studies indicate that the traditional housekeeping genes are not always stably expressed when tested in other species or in a wider range of experimental treatments  <cit> . for example, nicot and colleagues demonstrated that act did not appear to be the best gene to use as reference gene during the different treatments  <cit> . in addition, gutierrez and colleagues have found high variability in the relative expression of common reference genes, including act, tub, ubq and ef, during various developmental stages in arabidopsis  <cit> .

this means that the most stable reference gene should be identified for a specific species under study or in a new experimental set-up. accordingly, for gene expression studies in chicory, the stability of reference genes needs to be verified prior to use in qrt-pcr. actin- <dig> is the only reported gene used in qrt-pcr in chicory  <cit> . the direct transfer of traditional and recently proposed novel candidate reference genes by czechowski and colleagues  <cit>  to non-model plants such as chicory is hampered by the limited availability of genomic sequences. we thus selected a series of candidate reference genes for which such sequence information was available. we developed a qrt-pcr method for act, ef, rrna, gapdh, h <dig>  tub, nadhd and fehii as the target gene. the specificity of the qrt-pcr primer pairs was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, tm analysis and sequencing of the amplicons. the pcr amplification efficiency was estimated, and the reference genes were ranked according to their expression level stability across chicory leaf and root tissues using three different methods.

we used genorm, which has been recently noted as one of the best methods to determine the most stably expressed genes for qrt-pcr analysis  <cit> . in addition, genorm supplies more information about the optimal number of genes in a given experimental dataset. the analysis showed that the expression of act and ef are the most stable across tissues as compared with the other selected genes. data analysis of expression stability  and normalisation factor variation  determined that rrna, h <dig> and tub can be added in combination with act/ef to calculate a normalisation factor based on multiple reference genes  <cit> . the stability of a candidate gene is determined by pairwise comparison of variation of expression ratio in genorm. in order to avoid co-regulation, following the lead of many other reports  <cit> , we also determined the stability of the selected genes using normfinder, which is less sensitive to co-regulation of the reference genes. normfinder identified act, ef, rrna and h <dig> as the four most stable genes, which supports the genorm analysis in this experiment. according to the results obtained from bestkeeper analysis ranking of the five most stable genes was as follows: rrna, act, ef, tub and gapdh. pfaffl and colleagues demonstrated that low-expressed genes , with cp values around cycles 30- <dig>  definitely show different variance compared to high-expressed genes  with cp values around  <dig> or even less. such two genes can only be correlated on their ranking, not parametrically  <cit> . thus, when comparing genes with very different expression levels, it is necessary to use a new model-based analysis that also employs non-parametric methods such as the spearman and kendall tau correlation coefficient. nevertheless, the latter algorithm is affected by a circular statistical problem; among these three algorithms bestkeeper is inferior to the two other algorithms. recently, other studies on validation of reference genes have shown that gapdh is not stable in different tissues or environmental conditions  <cit> . czechowski and colleagues  <cit>  compared traditional and novel reference genes in arabidopsis and found that gapdh was ranked among the  <dig> most stably expressed genes only after omission of seed and pollen samples, while tub <dig>  ef-1Î± and act <dig> were never represented in the top  <dig>  these results also indicate that there are no universal reference genes for all plant species. validation is thus essential for any selected housekeeping gene used as reference gene in gene expression analysis. in conclusion, the three algorithms do not rank the candidate reference genes in the same order, but all indicated that rrna, act and ef are the most stably expressed genes, given the experimental conditions applied in this study. h <dig>  tub, gapdh and nadhd were ranked differently by different software programmes' analysis.

rrna is one of the highly stably expressed genes . however, there are some drawbacks when using this gene as reference. one of the main problems of using total rna for normalisation is the large quantity of 18s or 28s rrna transcripts in comparison to the target mrna transcripts  <cit> , as revealed by a relatively low cp value for rrna in this experiment. additionally, the mrna fraction in total rna may differ from sample to sample  <cit> . due to the high abundance of 18s and 28s rrna transcripts, when using rrna as an internal control for quantification of genes with relatively low expression levels , the cdna templates may need additional dilution to improve comparison.

increasing the number of reference genes for normalisation will improve the accuracy of the analysis, but it is expensive and time-consuming. use of two stable reference genes is a valid normalisation strategy in most cases, and has already resulted in more accurate and reliable normalisation compared to the use of a single reference gene  <cit> . the current study suggests that act and ef would be two valid reference genes for gene expression study in chicory leaf and root tissues. the qrt-pcr methods described here have important applications in quantifying gene expression levels in chicory as shown by the fehii expression analysis. this analysis showed that the fehii transcript in different plant and tissue samples varies widely. the relative expression analysis of fehii also showed that the expression level is low, but still detectable, in leaf  and root tip tissues  and is more highly expressed in mature root tissue . we conclude that the qrt-pcr methods described here facilitate sensitive and accurate quantification of gene expression in chicory.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to validate a set of commonly used candidate reference genes in chicory for the normalisation of gene expression analysis using qrt-pcr. analysis of stability using genorm, normfinder and bestkeeper revealed that the expression of act and ef is the most stable across root and leaf tissues. in addition, data analysis using genorm suggested that three genes  can be added in combination with act/ef to calculate the normalisation factor based on multiple reference genes  <cit> . the expression analyses of fehii emphasise the importance of validating reference genes to achieve accurate qrt-pcr analysis. these methods may further be employed to identify the most stable reference genes in other tissues or under other experimental conditions in future studies on chicory.
