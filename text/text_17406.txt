BACKGROUND
prior to clinical application, the safety and efficacy of newly developed therapies or innovative medical devices have to be ensured. thus animal models have become an essential part of researchers' armamentarium in nearly all fields of experimental research
 <cit> . especially in the field of translational and preclinical research, in regard to the transferability of new therapies to humans, large animals are indispensable
 <cit> . the sheep is a commonly used experimental animal model
 <cit> , above all due to its human similarity regarding the vascular and skeletal system. it has become an irreplaceable animal model, particularly in research concerning the cardiovascular system, as well as the investigations of heart assist devices and heart valve replacement therapy
 <cit> . the sheep is ideally suited to investigate issues in vitro <cit>  and in vivo, for example in orthopaedic traumatology
 <cit>  and reconstructive surgery, especially in the field of tissue engineering
 <cit> , dealing with the generation of autonomously vascularised tissue. in these special experimental setups, optimal anticoagulation schemes with suitable monitoring are required to ensure successful procedures, thus avoiding early dropouts because of vascular obliteration. studies on anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in sheep are very rare. most studies were performed several years to decades ago and report small experimental groups with conflicting data on possible strategies, mostly using anticoagulation protocols already established in humans
 <cit> . to date, the knowledge of the differences between the sheep and human anticoagulation system is limited. only few and sometimes inconsistent data exist. for example, remarkably different concentrations of clotting factors in sheep compared to humans are reported in literature
 <cit> . due to the different platelet aggregation characteristics of sheep in comparison to human platelets, a reliable effect in sheep cannot be guaranteed when applying human antiplatelet therapy protocols
 <cit> .

in the human clinical setting, there are a variety of medical options for the prevention of thromboembolic events. in addition to the newly developed ticagrelor
 <cit> , acetylsalicylic acid  and clopidogrel are the most commonly used platelet aggregation inhibitors
 <cit> . anticoagulant protocols based on heparin are applied in a large number of experimental studies using the sheep in vivo model, however, due to short effect duration, administration every  <dig> hours is necessary
 <cit> . the efficacy of the inhibition of factor xa  by low-molecular-weight heparin  was investigated in a few studies in adult sheep
 <cit> , however, never in lambs. dabigatran etexilate is a newly developed oral direct thrombin inhibitor
 <cit> , for which the feasibility and safety of switching from enoxaparin is described in literature
 <cit> . however, no data exist about the usage of this new thrombin inhibitor in sheep.

since there are no optimal methods for the prevention of thromboembolic events in sheep, nor standardised measurement methods described so far for the determination of the antiplatelet effect, the aim of this study was to establish an optimal thrombosis prophylaxis strategy, as well as a testing system to ensure the efficacy of an antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in sheep.

RESULTS
establishment of a method for the assessment of platelet function in sheep
no standardised measurement method for the assessment of platelet function in sheep has been described so far, thus a testing system to evaluate the efficacy of antiplatelet drugs in sheep was established.

in the impedance aggregometry internal laboratory agonist concentrations for human blood were used to induce platelet aggregation in sheep blood. adenosine diphosphate   induced platelet aggregation to an extent expected of that for human blood  738 ±  <dig>  au*min). in contrast, arachidonic acid   and thrombin receptor-activating peptide  <dig>   could not sufficiently induce platelet aggregation in sheep blood. increasing the concentration of aa up to  <dig>  mm and trap- <dig> up to  <dig> μm did not result in induction of platelet aggregation. internal laboratory human reference ranges were used as target values : 534– <dig> au*min, auc : 745– <dig> au*min, auc : 941– <dig> au*min). since not all agonists could sufficiently induce platelet aggregation, the continued use of impedance aggregometry was rejected.

in the lta, final concentrations of  <dig>  mg/ml of collagen  and  <dig> × 10- <dig> m of adp  induced adequate platelet final aggregation  in sheep prp. the initial aa concentration of  <dig>  mm  had to be increased to  <dig>  mm to induce platelet aggregation sufficiently.

therefore, these concentrations were used for the determination of reference values evaluating the platelet aggregation of  <dig> healthy and untreated sheep :  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, adp-fa:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, aa-fa:  <dig>  ±  <dig> %). calculated cut-off values include  <dig> % for col-fa,  <dig> % for adp-fa and  <dig> % for aa-fa.

all sheep and lambs survived the experiments unscathed. no side effects, such as signs of haemorrhage were observed during the study. periodically performed counting of platelets resulted in a mean platelet value of 424 ±  <dig> × 103/μl.

the results of the experimental groups are mentioned below.

asa did not inhibit sheep platelet aggregation
the efficacy of asa in sheep was tested in two different modes of application over  <dig> days in the lta and through bleeding time  on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, the efficacy of a high concentration of asa was evaluated in vitro using lta.

the application of  <dig> mg asa twice a day  per os   induced no significant differences in aa and collagen induced platelet final aggregation between baseline, days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

no significant differences were induced with the application of  <dig> mg asa bid intravenously   between the measurement time points during the 7-day treatment . final aggregation values in groups 1a and b did not decline below the cut-off values at any time point.

bt did not change significantly either after p.o. or after i.v. administration.

the effect of asa on sheep platelets was measured in vitro . the addition of asa in a final concentration of  <dig> mg/ml and  <dig> mg/ml could not induce any inhibition of sheep platelet final aggregation after stimulating with aa or collagen compared to the values of the baseline and control . final aggregation values did not decline below the cut-off values at any asa concentration. the effect of  <dig> mg/ml asa on human platelets served as positive control . after the addition of  <dig> mg/ml asa, collagen induced platelet final aggregation still was 78%.

effect of clopidogrel on sheep and lamb platelet aggregation
the inhibition of platelet aggregation was evaluated in sheep in three different dosages over  <dig> days and in one dosage in lambs over  <dig> days using lta and bt on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively.

no significant antiplatelet effect could be observed when clopidogrel was administered to sheep over  <dig> days in a concentration of  <dig> mg bid ,  <dig> mg bid ,  <dig> mg bid .

the application of  <dig> mg clopidogrel bid to lambs over  <dig> days  induced no significant differences between baseline and days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

nonetheless, more detailed analysis of the sheep values revealed a trend towards inhibiting of adp-fa on day  <dig> with the increment of the concentration  . values below the cut-off value  could be measured on day  <dig>  when administering the highest dosage  to sheep and  <dig> mg bid to lambs on days  <dig> and  <dig> . in lambs between days  <dig> and  <dig>  no significant difference could be detected.

considering the sheep and lambs individually in relation to the cut-off values, intersubject variability can be observed. adp induced platelet fa decreased below the cut-off value in  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep and in  <dig> out of  <dig> lambs. in sheep  <dig>  the increase in dosage from  <dig> mg to  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg bid induced an inhibition of adp induced platelet fa below the cut-off value on day  <dig>  . in sheep  <dig>   <dig> mg bid was sufficient to inhibit adp induced platelet final aggregation below the cut-off value from day  <dig> on. raising the dosage to  <dig> mg and  <dig> mg bid did not further influence this effect . comparing groups 2c  and 2d , almost receiving the same dosage per kilogram, no significant difference could be measured.

bt did not change significantly in each of the concentrations tested.

clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylic acid were detected in every plasma sample. an analysis of the concentrations of clopidogrel and its main inactive metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid was performed in groups 2c  and 2d  on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , respectively.

during the 7-day treatment with  <dig> mg  and the 28-day treatment with  <dig> mg  clopidogrel bid, clopidogrel and its metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid were measured in each sample from all sheep and all lambs .

calibration range was  <dig> – <dig>  ng/ml for clopidogrel and 100– <dig> ng/ml for clopidogrel carboxylic acid. intraday coefficients of variation ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for clopidogrel and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for clopidogrel carboxylic acid. the intraday accuracies ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for clopidogrel and from  <dig>  to  <dig> % for clopidogrel carboxylic acid.

there was a highly significant difference in concentration of clopidogrel carboxylic acid between the measurement time points in sheep  and in lambs . in sheep, highly significant differences were measured between every time point , with the exception of days  <dig> and  <dig>  in lambs, a significant increase from baseline to day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and day  <dig>  could be detected. no significant change was seen between all other measurement time points.

in sheep and lambs, clopidogrel could be detected in each sample on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. values among sheep and lambs differed greatly. there were no significant differences between the measurement time points in sheep and lambs.

there were significant and highly significant differences concerning the clopidogrel carboxylic acid concentration between sheep and lambs on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the animal's age had a highly significant influence on the concentration of the metabolite .

no significant differences in clopidogrel plasma concentration could be detected between sheep and lambs.

there was no association noticed between clopidogrel or clopidogrel carboxylic acid concentration and adp-fa levels in the individual sheep.

ticagrelor inhibited platelet aggregation in  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep
in group  <dig>  the antiplatelet agent ticagrelor was administered to sheep in four different dosages  for a time period of  <dig> days. the efficacy was tested in lta and bt on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

mean values after administration of ticagrelor showed no significant change in platelet final aggregation between the measurement time points. adp induced platelet final aggregation did not decrease below the cut-off values at any time point. regarding the values of the individual sheep in groups 3c and d , an inhibition of adp induced platelet fa below the cut-off value could only be noticed in sheep  <dig> . there was no significant change between baseline and measurement time points for bt.

in sheep, human therapeutic anti-fxa levels were achieved using sodium enoxaparin
the fxa inhibitor sodium enoxaparin was administered to sheep in two different dosages over  <dig> days. its efficacy was evaluated through anti-fx activity in plasma on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the administration of a loading dose of  <dig> mg/kg and  <dig> mg/kg bid subcutaneous  in group 4a induced anti-fxa levels below the human prophylactic range  . there was a significant increase in anti-fxa levels, comparing reference values  with day  <dig>  and  <dig> . between baseline and day  <dig>  values did not differ significantly .

in group 4b  values within the human therapeutic range  were measured from day  <dig> on. a highly significant increase was seen between reference values and day  <dig> , day  <dig>  and day  <dig> , respectively. between days  <dig> and  <dig>  values did not differ significantly .

exemplary measurements over  <dig> hours on day  <dig> of  <dig> sheep in group 4b were performed. the anti-fxa activity throughout  <dig> hours revealed peak plasma levels   <dig> hours after administration of  <dig> mg/kg, which rapidly decreased in the next hours to finally  <dig>  ±  <dig>  iu/ml  <dig> hours after injection .

in lambs, human therapeutic anti-fxa levels were achieved using sodium enoxaparin in a higher dosage than in sheep
the anti-fxa inhibitor sodium enoxaparin was administered to lambs in two different concentrations over  <dig> days. its efficacy was evaluated through anti-fx activity in plasma on baseline, days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

the administration of  <dig> mg/kg s.c. bid to lambs in group 4c could not achieve human therapeutic anti-fxa activity  . no significant increase between reference values  and days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could be seen .

comparing these results  with sheep  receiving the same concentration of sodium enoxaparin per kilogram, significant and highly significant differences in the anti-fxa activity were observed , revealing the age to have a significant influence on the effectiveness of sodium enoxaparin .

raising the dosage to  <dig> mg/kg s.c. bid in lambs in group 4d resulted in anti-fxa activities in the therapeutic range from day  <dig> on . there was a highly significant increase between reference values and days  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . between days  <dig> and  <dig>  values did not differ significantly .

therapeutic anti-fxa activity was achieved with the high dosage in lambs  on days  <dig> and  <dig> and differs not significantly from that in sheep with the high dosage  .

interindividual different and delayed response to dabigatran etexilate
the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate was administered to sheep over  <dig> days in a dosage of  <dig> mg bid p.o. its efficacy was evaluated using the hemoclot® test.

in plasma, dabigatran could be determined 4– <dig> hours after the first oral application on day  <dig> . on days  <dig> and  <dig>  maximum dabigatran concentrations were measured at a time point  <dig> hours after application . measurements  <dig> hours after the last application resulted in dabigatran plasma concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μg/ml . there were no significant differences when comparing reference values  and maximum plasma dabigatran plasma levels on day  <dig>  day  <dig> and day  <dig> 

interindividual differences could be noted when considering values of the individual sheep on the different measurement time points. in  <dig> sheep, plasma concentrations of dabigatran in the range of human values were detected on day  <dig>  .

discussion
in this study, the efficacy of different antiplatelet drugs and anticoagulants was evaluated in sheep of different ages in order to establish a reliable antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy for sheep in experimental research. two different aggregometry systems were assessed for their ability to measure platelet function in this species, because to date no standardised method has been described for the evaluation of platelet aggregation in sheep.

light transmission aggregometry, but not impedance aggregometry, serves as a reliable testing system for evaluation of reference values in healthy and untreated sheep
the impedance aggregometry provides several advantages compared to lta, for example, the usage of whole blood samples preserving the natural environment of the platelets and the elimination of the time-consuming centrifugation step, thus avoiding the collection of large blood volumes and the loss of large platelets. the platelet volume significantly affects its function
 <cit>  with the mean platelet volume correlating with platelet function and activation
 <cit> . however, this system has essentially proved unsuitable for the evaluation of platelet function in sheep. our data are concordant with those of the study of baumgarten et al., in which neither aa nor trap, could induce measurable platelet aggregation in healthy sheep
 <cit> . one can assume that there might be other potent ways for the induction of platelet aggregation in sheep than stimulation by aa. the lack of response to trap was already regarded by baumgarten et al. as a reflection of a species-specific thrombin receptor. therefore it was not considered essential to test this system with collagen, because the same testing system should be used for all groups in the study. in the lta, still considered the gold standard for evaluation of platelet function
 <cit> , platelet aggregation could be induced with all agonists needed for the study . for this reason this system was used in every single group.

in every group blood was anticoagulated with citrate according to the recommendations of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis
 <cit> . however, it would be possible to anticoagulate the blood with other agents, such as hirudin or to use washed platelets to reduce a possible effect of the low calcium concentration in prp of citrate anticoagulated blood
 <cit> .

the recommended concentrations of adp and collagen for human prp achieved sufficient platelet aggregation in sheep prp. aa concentration had to be increased up to  <dig>  mmol/l. sheep possess a higher number of platelets in contrast to humans and therefore possibly need a higher concentration of agonists for the induction of platelet aggregation. there seem to be some fundamental differences in platelet aggregation processes of sheep compared to humans. goodman et al. examined platelet-material interactions and showed that platelets of sheep attached to surfaces much less, never reached fully spread shapes and displayed a lower overall activity than human platelets
 <cit> . the adhesion of sheep platelets to immobilised fibrinogen surfaces was, in contrast to other animals, only possible when stimulated by adp, although to a lesser extent than platelets from other animal species
 <cit> .

the results of aa induced aggregation in this study are comparable with previously recorded data showing that low  compared to high  concentrations could not reach complete sheep platelet aggregation in the lta. in this study, a concentration of  <dig>  mmol/l aa was identified to be crucial for an adequate level of aggregation. this difference could be due to a 3– <dig> fold interindividual variation, as already mentioned by baumgarten et al.
 <cit> , especially when working with small numbers of animals. in addition, the agonists are obtained by different manufacturers and therefore could vary in their biological activity
 <cit> .

in our laboratory calculated human cut-off values for the different agonists are established for clinical routine use, however not for sheep. these reference values should not be used due to the differences between human and sheep platelet aggregation and anticoagulation systems. to increase the reliability of the results of the study, new cut-offs with blood from healthy untreated sheep of the same breed were calculated, which revealed quite small interindividual differences. for data comparison in every individual sheep, baseline values were measured before starting the medication.

asa could not inhibit sheep platelet aggregation both in vivo and in vitro
there are still many research groups administering acetylsalicylic acid  for the prevention of thromboembolic events in sheep, without knowing if there is any antiplatelet effect
 <cit> . asa induces an inhibition of platelet function by irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase activity of prostaglandin h-synthase-1
 <cit> , also known as cyclooxygenase- <dig> . in our study, inhibition of platelet aggregation through the application of asa could be achieved neither in vivo nor in vitro. data have been published about the effect of asa and its pharmacokinetics in sheep, but never examining the antiplatelet effect of asa. in a previous study, the absorption process of salicylate after oral administration seemed particularly inefficient in the ruminant animal
 <cit> , in this case possibly due to the coating with gelatin.

the high ph of the rumen favours the existence of the ionised and non-diffusible form of asa. in contrast, the non-ionised and diffusible form dominates in the stomach of monogastrics. nevertheless, in cattle bioavailability of 70% could be achieved with high oral salicylate concentrations
 <cit> .

therefore, the ineffectiveness of the drug is most likely not caused by insufficient absorption. when given intravenously, a rapid elimination of salicylate from the plasma of cattle, particularly of goats and sheep, was demonstrated, probably on the basis of high renal excretion rates of salicylate
 <cit> . asa induced antiplatelet effects are attained with only low concentrations and persist over some days, even when asa already has been eliminated from plasma due to the irreversible effect on platelets. thus, the rapid disappearance after venous administration is probably not the explanation for the ineffectiveness.

when examining the effect in the in vitro experiment, no inhibition of platelet aggregation could be measured. in the positive control , aa induced platelet aggregation was inhibited with asa sufficiently, however not the collagen induced platelet aggregation. collagen is probably not as suitable as an agonist, because inhibition of an aggregation response by aspirin occurs at lower inhibition rates of thromboxane a <dig>  synthesis and it is more variable. aa is described as a more suitable platelet agonist than others , which are working through pathways that are less dependent on thromboxane production
 <cit> . to prove a sufficient effect of aspirin on platelet aggregation a nearly complete inhibition of txa <dig> synthesis would be a necessary prerequisite to prevent aggregation induced by a strong agonist such as thrombin and could be therefore a system to test for aspirin resistance. furthermore one has to keep in mind, that there are different types of collagen which can lead to variance in their reactivity. for example collagen type i, ii, iii, iv are described to be more reactive than other types 
 <cit> . in another study collagen type iii was found to be a more potent inducer of platelet aggregation than type i and ii
 <cit> . possibly we could achieve different results using other types of collagens. moreover collagen concentration was quite high in our experiments; probably with lower concentrations inhibition of platelet aggregation could be detected.

the experimental setup was similar to an early study of spanos et al.
 <cit> , with the difference of using other concentrations of aggregation inducing agonists and a higher concentration of asa in accordance to the asa control of the multiplate® analyser .

moreover, two previous studies have shown a 37- and 31-fold better asa induced inhibition of prostaglandin synthetase from human platelets than from sheep seminal vesicles, unclear whether depending on the different tissue origin or not
 <cit> . finally, it can be assumed that sheep platelet aggregation occurs to a large extent independently of aa and txa <dig>  as has already been proposed
 <cit> . the need of very high concentrations of aa in the lta to induce aggregation supports this hypothesis.

on the other hand, there could be a txa <dig> production despite asa administration, either by insufficient inhibition of cox- <dig> or cox- <dig> independent production of txa <dig>  measurement of txb <dig> in blood serum could serve for an indirect assessment of the concentration of txa <dig> <cit> . it should be an issue of future studies to determine the underlying reasons for the ineffectiveness of asa in sheep.

clopidogrel inhibited adp induced platelet final aggregation adequately in  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep and in  <dig> out of  <dig> lambs, while clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylic acid were detected in every plasma sample
clopidogrel is an oral adp receptor antagonist which inhibits platelet activation through blockade of the p2y <dig> adp receptor on the platelet surface
 <cit> . an inhibition of sheep platelet aggregation just below the cut-off value could be achieved on day  <dig>  when administering the highest dosage. the high standard deviations resulted from the high intersubject variability. in  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep and  <dig> out of  <dig> lambs an effective inhibition of platelet aggregation could be shown. no significant changes between days  <dig> and  <dig> could be seen, thus indicating the formation of a steady state after the one-week treatment. in sheep  <dig>  sufficient inhibition of platelet aggregation could be reached even with the lowest dosage of clopidogrel, whereas sheep  <dig> required a higher dosage for effective inhibition of platelet aggregation. this observation is possibly due to clopidogrel resistance: in humans platelet aggregation of low- or non-responders can be inhibited more effectively when increasing the dosage of clopidogrel
 <cit> . connell et al. noted only a modest antiplatelet response to clopidogrel, when treating  <dig> sheep and goats with 75– <dig> mg/day
 <cit> .

after absorption, the main and inactive metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid is formed by intestinal or hepatic esterase. only a very small amount of about 15% is metabolised in the liver through the activity of different isoenzymes of the p <dig> system. it is well known that there are interspecies differences and variations concerning the drug metabolism mediated by the cytochrome p <dig> system
 <cit> .

one of the most frequently discussed reasons for clopidogrel ineffectiveness is the genetic polymorphism in the cytochrome p <dig> system 
 <cit> . cyp2c <dig> is a highly polymorphic enzyme with more than  <dig> different alleles. the most common cyp2c <dig> loss-of-function allele is the allele * <dig>  while homozygous carriers  have a very low metabolism, in heterozygous carriers  it is only reduced
 <cit> . however, there are no data concerning the existence of these gene variants in sheep.

in humans, clopidogrel resistance can occur in the case of inadequate compliance, poor absorption, non-optimal dosages, smoking, gene polymorphisms or drug interactions
 <cit> .

however, in sheep, limited efficacy of clopidogrel could be due to a reduced absorption of clopidogrel, a degradation or inactivation in the forestomach system, or an accelerated clearance of the active metabolite, or the above-mentioned genetic variations concerning the cytochrome p <dig> system or the p2y <dig> target receptor. other explanations for the limited clopidogrel effects are possibly a higher number of p2y <dig> receptors on sheep platelets, other more important ways of the initiation of platelet aggregation, an accelerated platelet turnover, or a higher number of platelets in sheep.

in every sample from all sheep, clopidogrel and the inactive metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid were measured. in  <dig> out of  <dig> baseline samples clopidogrel was measured. most likely, this was due to laboratory contamination as definitely none of the animals had received any drugs  <dig> weeks prior to blood collection. the inactive metabolite clopidogrel carboxylic acid could be detected in concentrations lower than expected for such a high dosage. levels comparable to those in humans treated with  <dig> mg/day could not be reached
 <cit> . besides a poor absorption, other reasons for the low metabolite concentrations are probably a lower conversion of clopidogrel or a higher clearance rate of the metabolite.

an age-dependency of the concentration of clopidogrel carboxylic acid in plasma could be revealed. clopidogrel carboxylic acid concentrations were significantly lower in lambs, although receiving a comparable dosage of clopidogrel, probably due to an accelerated clearance of the metabolite in young animals. regarding the individual values of sheep and lambs, the metabolite concentration seems not to be linked with the effectiveness of clopidogrel as an antiplatelet drug. there was no difference in plasma clopidogrel concentration between sheep and lambs. taken into account the high individual variability and the high conversion rate of another clopidogrel metabolite  into clopidogrel, it is not yet possible to draw a final conclusion on its exact concentration in sheep blood. lambs were treated with clopidogrel for  <dig> days to investigate if there was an accumulation or an increase of the clearance of this drug, but neither clopidogrel carboxylic acid nor clopidogrel concentration changed significantly.

in consideration of the clopidogrel results, one can presume that an effectiveness of clopidogrel cannot be ensured on the first day of the treatment when the steady state has not yet been reached, even not after a loading dose of  <dig> mg. prospective studies with large groups of animals should be performed to generate sufficient data for the evaluation of the reasons and frequency of non- or low-responders in sheep.

ticagrelor inhibited adp induced platelet final aggregation in only  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep
when testing the newly developed direct adp p2y <dig> inhibitor ticagrelor in group  <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> sheep turned out to be non-responders. only in sheep  <dig>  already showing good antiplatelet responses to all dosages of clopidogrel, values below the cut-off value could be detected when administering high dosages of ticagrelor. the outcomes of several human clinical studies comparing clopidogrel and ticagrelor in favour of the latter and its additional ability to prevent vasoconstriction through the inhibition of local p2y <dig> receptors in the vascular smooth muscle
 <cit> , suggested ticagrelor as a good alternative to clopidogrel. furthermore, ticagrelor has been described as being superior to clopidogrel because of its capacity to be effective without the requirement of hepatic conversion. however, this study revealed only a weak efficacy of ticagrelor in sheep. these data raise doubts about a deficiency in the cytochrome p <dig> system in sheep being a factor for the insufficient effect of clopidogrel. the reasons for the ineffectiveness of ticagrelor and clopidogrel might be similar, because of a comparable mode of action and comparable antiplatelet responses of the sheep. the poorer efficacy of ticagrelor could be due to the reversible binding and the subsequently faster diffusion of ticagrelor from the p2y <dig> receptor. moreover, there is a dependency of inhibition of platelet aggregation and the concentration of the drug in plasma available to occupy receptors
 <cit> . taking these findings together, one reason for the weak efficacy of ticagrelor can be an accelerated clearance of the drug.

bleeding time did not serve as a reliable testing system for the evaluation of platelet aggregation inhibitors in sheep
bt is an in vivo test for assessing primary haemostasis, often criticised for its high level of errors due to the wide normal range in bleeding time and limited reproducibility
 <cit> . to guarantee a high reliability, a standardised method was established. the values were considered with respect to the baseline of every individual sheep because of the high intervariability. however, no significant prolonging of bt could be demonstrated. the measurement of antiplatelet effects via bt seems to be unreliable in sheep, even when using a standardised technique.

in sheep and lambs, human therapeutic anti-fxa levels were achieved using sodium enoxaparin in age-dependent dosages
the administration of  <dig> mg/kg sodium enoxaparin bid in sheep resulted in anti-fxa activities in the range of human therapeutic values, however not on the first day. it would be conceivable giving a loading dose at the beginning of the treatment. between days  <dig> and  <dig>  no significant difference of the anti-xa activity was detectable, thus indicating the formation of a steady state. twenty-four hours after the last injection, only a very low anti-fxa activity was measured, hence the administration of  <dig> mg/kg sodium enoxaparin every  <dig> hours seems to be necessary. the objective was to achieve human therapeutic anti-fxa activities rather than human prophylactic values to ensure the prevention of thromboembolic events after microvascular surgery.

only few studies have examined the effect of sodium enoxaparin in sheep, however, never taking into consideration the animal's age. other measurement time points, different anti-fxa assays and weight of the animals complicate direct comparisons
 <cit> . ao et al. investigated the effect of lmwh on intimal hyperplasia and concluded a daily dosage of  <dig> mg/kg to be adequate
 <cit> . since, in the present experiment, no haemorrhagic complications were noticed in any sheep, the higher dosage of  <dig> mg/kg bid seems to be decisive for the avoidance of thromboembolic events in even very small diameter blood vessels in sheep.

when increasing the dosage for lambs from  <dig> mg/kg bid up to  <dig> mg/kg bid, values in the human therapeutic range could be measured, which were consistent with those obtained from sheep with a dosage of  <dig> mg/kg bid. it became evident that age has a significant influence on the effect of lmwh in sheep, as has already been demonstrated by several studies in humans
 <cit> . likely explanations for the low effect of sodium enoxaparin in lambs, other young animals or children are a higher volume of distribution, an increased total clearance and lower concentrations of antithrombin related to developmental haemostasis
 <cit> . however, some authors have raised doubts about the different antithrombin concentrations being a dependent factor
 <cit> . age-related differences concerning competitive binding to the endothelium, as well as absorption and clearance of the drug seem to be more important mechanisms
 <cit> . throughout the present study, human therapeutic ranges of anti-fxa activity were considered as target values. nevertheless, there are no data available whether sheep require this activity to reach therapeutic success and prophylaxis of thromboembolic events. even in human medicine, there are no generally accepted regimes available that could serve as evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of thrombosis in microsurgery
 <cit> . the establishment of a reliable prophylaxis of thromboembolic events in human and in sheep microsurgery should be an issue of future studies.

an experimental group with heparin was not performed due to the high variability in response in sheep and the short effect duration leading to a necessary administration every  <dig> hours
 <cit> .

interindividual different and delayed response to dabigatran etexilate
the administration of the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran etexilate resulted in dabigatran plasma concentrations similar to human ranges only in  <dig> out of  <dig> sheep, probably due to a low absorption rate of the drug. the drug is incorporated in capsules of tartaric acid to guarantee the formation of a local acid environment which supports the successful absorption of dabigatran etexilate
 <cit> . in sheep, the capsule could be damaged due to the physiological ruminating thus resulting in a decrement of absorption.

the delayed onset of action  compared to humans  and the high inter-individual differences can also be justified in the special forestomach system and the always filled rumen of sheep. in humans, when the drug is taken together with a meal, time for reaching maximum plasma levels will be prolonged up to  <dig> hours.

sheep received quadruple dosages  compared to humans, due to the fact that the administration of  <dig> mg bid proved to be inefficient in a pilot study. in recent studies in swine

 <cit>  even higher dosages were used. however, the dosage should not be elevated in this experiment due to the efficacy in  <dig> sheep and the increased possibility of bleeding complications. because of the unpredictability of an effect of dabigatran etexilate together with a delayed onset of action, the administration of sodium enoxaparin seems to be superior to dabigatran etexilate as anticoagulant. nevertheless, there are no data available whether sheep require the same plasma concentrations of dabigatran as humans to achieve an prophylactic effect.

it would be an interesting objective for future studies to test the efficacy of these established dosages of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents in larger groups of animals in order to obtain more representative data. the antithrombotic effect of the different drugs should then be investigated under “real” surgical conditions. moreover, it could be worth testing to optimise the efficacy when combining an antiplatelet with an anticoagulant drug.

CONCLUSIONS
for the first time, a standardised method for the assessment of platelet function in sheep as well as baseline values were established in this study since no standardised tests have been described so far. the efficacy of different therapeutic strategies for antiplatelet and anticoagulant management in different concentrations was compared in sheep and lambs. in summary, high dosages of clopidogrel or ticagrelor are useful to inhibit platelet aggregation in some sheep, while treatment with asa cannot reach an antiplatelet response. examination of the effectiveness of these antiplatelet drugs should always be performed by lta due to the presence of non- or low-responders among sheep and thus the need for a dose escalation. for a safe anticoagulation regime in sheep with sodium enoxaparin, it should be administered twice daily in age-dependent dosages. when using dabigatran etexilate as anticoagulant, its efficacy should be proven in each individual sheep before starting an experiment to have the possibility of a dose escalation. moreover, its delayed onset of action has to be carefully considered.

although only examining a small number of animals, the data provide significant information about widely used and novel antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents in sheep.

the results may contribute to overcoming the problems of high numbers of dropouts due to thromboembolic events and can support the improvement of a safe and reliable thromboembolic prophylaxis in sheep in experimental research.

the results of this study could make a decisive contribution towards the reduction of unnecessary high animal numbers in experimental in vivo research.
