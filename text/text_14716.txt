BACKGROUND
although the cellular response to one particular ligand is usually specific to a given cell type  <cit> , some studies have shown that the duration  <cit>  or concentration  <cit>  of the external stimuli may also influence the transcriptional program and cell fate decision. gene expression profiling in a pancreatic beta cell model treated with glucose and camp has shown that the majority of genes regulated in sustained treated cells were not regulated by transient  treatment, indicating that beta cells can produce drastically different transcriptional outputs in response to different durations of metabolic stimuli  <cit> . glauser et al.  <cit>  later showed that sustained elevated glucose promotes long-term phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases  followed by sustained changes in the activator protein  <dig>  subunits composition as well as in ap- <dig> controlled gene expression. hence, the authors suggested that in transiently  treated cells the erk1/ <dig> activation is too short to stabilize downstream gene expression. in human keratinocytes , sustained transforming growth factor beta  treatment induces a more persistent phosphorylation of the primary intracellular mediator smad <dig> than short pulses, and this may be critical for cell fate determination like cell growth arrest in this cell system  <cit> . others have observed that a group of tumour necrosis factor  upregulated genes which remain at high levels in the sustained mode for  <dig> h, quickly returned to baseline if tnf was removed after  <dig> h  <cit> . however, in which way the duration of external signals affects molecular and biological responses has only been explored in a few cell systems and the mechanisms are still not well characterized.

the peptide hormone gastrin is the central regulator of gastric acid secretion and plays a prominent role in regulation of growth and differentiation of gastric and colonic mucosa  <cit> . gastrin signals via the gastrin/cholecystokinin- <dig>  receptor  <cit> , and promotes a variety of cell or tissue specific outcomes including proliferation, survival, anti-apoptosis, differentiation and migration  <cit> . in normal physiological conditions, gastrin levels are transiently upregulated in response to a meal. prolonged elevated blood levels of gastrin  can occur as a consequence of e.g. atrophic gastritis or pharmacologic inhibition of gastric acid secretion, which interrupts negative feedback mechanisms on gastrin producing g-cells residing in the gastric mucosa  <cit> . recently it was shown that the gastrin promotor can be activated by disease associated helicobacter pylori strains via the egfr/raf/mek/erk cascade  <cit> . both hypergastrinemia and mutational activation of the cck <dig> receptor have been linked to development of neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours   <cit> ; and gastrin and cck2r are reported to be upregulated in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma  <cit> .

since transiently increased gastrin levels have important physiological functions in the gastrointestine, while sustained high gastrin levels  are related to pathophysiological processes  <cit> , it is of interest to examine how the duration of gastrin treatment affects gene expression and molecular responses. we have therefore conducted the present study to examine how adenocarcinoma cells respond to transient versus sustained gastrin signalling and to identify characteristic differences between downstream biological responses. to do this, we analysed genome-wide time series data of gastrin-regulated gene expression which compared treatment in the transient  versus sustained  mode. we used data from additional gastrin response time series experiments to identify dependence on de novo protein synthesis related to transcriptional timing  for genes that are upregulated in the sustained mode  and lower expressed in transiently treated cells. enrichment analysis of genes differentially regulated in transient versus sustained gastrin signalling suggested that pathways related to er stress, cell survival and anti-apoptosis were affected by duration of gastrin signalling. indeed, several genes known to be involved in these pathways were expressed at lower levels in cells treated in the transient mode as compared to cells treated in the sustained mode. furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of gastrin on serum starvation-induced apoptosis was dependent on sustained treatment, and our results indicate that the anti-apoptotic effect of gastrin involves pkc/erk1/ <dig> signalling. sustained gastrin treatment induced prolonged erk1/ <dig> activation and elevated levels of the ap- <dig> subunit protein junb. the important role of erk1/ <dig> and ap- <dig> in converting different durations of gastrin treatment into distinct transcriptional responses was strengthened by our findings that knock down of junb reduced gastrin-mediated transcriptional activation of genes related to the er stress and survival pathways. overall, our work may contribute to a better understanding on how a cell deciphers the durations of gastrin induced signalling into specific cellular responses.

RESULTS
identification of genes that are differentially regulated by transient versus sustained gastrin signalling
to investigate the mrna transcriptome in response to varying duration of gastrin treatment, we performed genome-wide microarray time series experiments in the adenocarcinoma cell line ar42j. we treated the cells in a sustained mode  and in a transient mode , as illustrated in figure 1a. statistical analysis of the time series gene expression responses identified  <dig> genes with lower and  <dig> genes with higher expression in cells treated with gastrin in transient versus sustained mode . the  <dig> differentially expressed genes were visualized in a cluster analysis heat map . the upper part of the heat map shows that the  <dig> genes expressed at higher levels in the transient mode are downregulated by sustained gastrin treatment compared to untreated controls, while the  <dig> genes with lower expression in the transient mode  are upregulated by sustained gastrin treatment. the heat map further illustrates that differences in gene expression between cells treated in the transient and sustained mode were subtle at  <dig>  h and  <dig> h, while substantial differences were apparent at time points after  <dig> h. the most striking overall trend for these  <dig> genes is that their transient mode expression levels after  <dig> h are similar to their levels in untreated cells, while they are clearly elevated or reduced in the sustained mode. these observations comply with our results from an earlier microarray  <dig> h time series study which showed that the regulation of several hundred genes was affected by gastrin signalling duration and that globally, gene expression levels returned earlier to baseline in cells subjected to transient  treatment compared to sustained treatment . thus, our results indicate that sustained gastrin signalling induces a transcriptional programme that differs significantly from the transcriptional response to transient gastrin signalling.

to search for molecular responses affected by the duration of gastrin treatment, the  <dig> genes exhibiting differential regulation in transiently versus sustained treated cells  were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis using the metacore tool of genego package  <cit> . we found that high scoring canonical pathway and networks were related to apoptosis-survival-development as well as to stress responses with a focus on the unfolded protein response , endoplasmic reticulum -stress, dna damage and cell cycle . gene ontology  biological process enrichment analysis of the  <dig> genes with lower expression in transiently versus sustained treated cells also identified cellular responses to unfolded proteins as significantly enriched . enriched go processes associated with the  <dig> genes with higher expression in the transient mode were related to cell cycle phases and mitosis . thus, it seems that sustained gastrin treatment is required for activation of genes involved in er stress/survival , while many genes that are less downregulated by transient treatment encode proteins that promote cell proliferation .

canonical pathways and networks most significantly associated with the  <dig> genes differentially expressed  in transient versus sustained gastrin treatment shown in the heat map in figure 1b and in additional file  <dig>  the  <dig> pathways and  <dig> networks with lowest p-values are shown as determined by the metacore tool of genego package  <cit> . enrichment analysis by go process is found in additional file 3: tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

er stress/upr is increasingly recognized to play a role in tumourigenesis as well as in cell homeostasis  <cit> . thus, our novel findings that gastrin i) regulate er stress/upr genes and ii) does so in a signal duration-specific manner are highly interesting. depending upon the duration and the degree of er stress, the upr can provide either survival signals by activating adaptive and anti-apoptotic pathways, or death signals by inducing cell death programs  <cit> . as illustrated by the selected genes shown in figure  <dig>  sustained gastrin treatment was required for increased expression of the main regulator of the upr, hspa <dig> , the transcription factor atf <dig> and the downstream mediators herpud <dig>  ddit <dig>  and chac <dig> <cit> . since herpud <dig> is reported to mediate cell protection via the stabilization of er ca2+ homeostasis  <cit> , its activation indicates a possible mechanism for enhanced cell survival by sustained gastrin treatment. in contrast, the atf <dig> target gene ddit <dig> , and ddit <dig> target gene chac <dig> encode proteins associated with the pro-apoptotic effect of the upr  <cit> . our results demonstrate that sustained gastrin treatment is required for induction of several er stress/upr genes and that the proteins encoded by these genes are associated with both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic effects. thus, it cannot be directly deduced from these results in which direction the subsequent cellular response will be affected.

the anti-apoptotic effect of gastrin is well documented  <cit> , and it is therefore of interest to take a closer look at the relation to apoptosis among the genes differentially regulated in the transient versus sustained mode. the pro-apoptotic casp <dig> exhibits higher expression levels in the transient mode than in the sustained mode, while the anti-apoptotic genes mcl <dig>  itpr <dig>  selm and clu were more strongly increased by sustained gastrin treatment . we have previously shown that clu is required for the anti-apoptotic effect of gastrin in our ar42j adenocarcinoma cell line model  <cit> . as a versatile stress-induced chaperone, clu is suggested to be involved in protein homeostasis via unfolded protein and er stress responses  <cit> , and was recently shown to function cooperatively with grp <dig>  to mediate anti-apoptotic effect in the mitochondria pathway  <cit> . mcl <dig>  a member of the bcl- <dig> protein family which inhibits release of cytochrome c from mitochondria  <cit> , has previously been shown to be involved in the anti-apoptotic effect of gastrin in human adenocarcinoma cells  stably transfected with the gastrin/cck- <dig> receptor  <cit> . the itpr <dig> receptor mediates ca2+ release from er and may be involved in mediating anti-apoptosis by interacting with anti-apoptotic members of the bcl- <dig> family, including mcl <dig>  <cit> , while selm is shown to decrease ca2+ release from er in response to oxidative stress and reduce apoptotic cell death  <cit> . taken together, our gene expression microarray analysis indicates that sustained but not transient gastrin treatment affects the balance between apoptosis and survival via several cross linked mechanisms including communication between er and mitochondria which is critical for cellular decision making  <cit> .

sustained gastrin treatment inhibits serum starvation-induced apoptosis via a pkc-dependent mechanism
to examine the effect of gastrin signalling duration on cell survival, we induced apoptosis in ar42j cells by serum starvation for  <dig> h and measured caspase activity in cells subjected to sustained or transient gastrin treatment. we found that sustained gastrin treatment significantly reduced effector caspase activity , which is in accordance with our previous results using both tunel and caspase assay for detection of apoptotic cells  <cit> . this anti-apoptotic effect was not detected in cells treated with gastrin in a transient mode . thus, manifestation of the gastrin-induced anti-apoptotic effect which is well documented in literature  <cit> , requires sustained gastrin treatment and is not induced when cells are exposed to gastrin for only  <dig> hour.

since both the pi3k/akt  pathway and erk1/ <dig> activation have been shown to be important in mediating the biological effects of gastrin, including anti-apoptosis  <cit> , we next set out to determine the involvement of these two signalling pathways in our anti-apoptosis model system. involvement of erk1/2-signalling was assayed by the use of a pkc-inhibitor, since erk1/ <dig> activation has been shown to be mediated by pkc-src/ras/raf/mek/erk1/ <dig> cascade and/or by direct activation of raf by pkc in the gastrin response  <cit> . the anti-apoptotic effect of sustained gastrin treatment was not influenced by the pi3k inhibitor . in the presence of the pkc inhibitor gastrin still resulted in a small decrease in caspase 3/ <dig> activity. however, this decrease was smaller than in the absence of the pkc-inhibitor, and the anti-apoptotic effect was no longer statistically significant . we therefore conclude that pkc and its downstream effector erk1/ <dig> may play a decisive role in the sustained gastrin-induced anti-apoptotic effect. this observation complies with results reported by others showing that a specific inhibitor of the erk1/ <dig> activator mek <dig> blocked gastrin-induced anti-apoptosis in ar42j cells  <cit> .

genes that require sustained gastrin treatment for late upregulation include both primary and secondary responders
cellular decision making in response to growth factors like gastrin is driven by transcriptional cascades involving primary response genes dominated by regulators of transcription and signal transduction and secondary response genes which depend on de novo protein synthesis and which include a high fraction of biological response effector genes  <cit> . to investigate primary and secondary transcriptional response mechanisms underlying the distinct biological responses to transient versus sustained gastrin signalling, we focused on genes that were markedly upregulated by gastrin and expressed at lower levels in the transient mode. this  <dig> gene subset can be grouped according to their time profiles as follows:  <dig> early genes peaking before  <dig> h ;  <dig> delayed genes with peak expression at 2– <dig> h ; and  <dig> late genes upregulated 4– <dig> h . genes dependent on de novo protein synthesis were identified by investigating the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor chx on gastrin-induced gene expression responses. this was done using data from a genome wide time series experiment where the cells were treated by gastrin in the absence and presence of chx. to minimize misinterpretation due to the confounding effect of chx  <cit> , the temporal profiles  of treated and control cells were manually evaluated: for those genes where the gastrin response in the presence of chx was higher than the response with chx alone, the gene was classified as a primary gene not dependent on de novo protein synthesis for gastrin-induced expression. gastrin induced genes that were not upregulated in the presence of chx were classified as secondary genes, i.e., genes whose transcriptional activation depends on de novo protein synthesis of one or several factors that must be induced by gastrin previous to these secondary genes. in cases where the effect of gastrin could not be separated from the confounding effect of chx, the gene was classified as uncertain. among the subset of  <dig> genes upregulated in sustained treated cells and lower expressed in transiently treated cells,  <dig> were classified as primary genes,  <dig> as secondary and  <dig> as uncertain. the fraction of primary genes was successively reduced from 100% among the early genes to 40% among the late genes, while  <dig> of the  <dig> secondary genes were found among the late gastrin induced genes . temporal expression data for genes in the subset are shown in additional file  <dig> 

 <dig> genes independent on de novo protein synthesis for gastrin induced expression ;  <dig> genes dependent on de novo protein synthesis for gastrin induced expression ; number of uncertain genes: n= 18;  <dig> temporal profiles are illustrated in figure 5; 4molecular functions are defined based on data from metacore tool of genego package  <cit>  gene ontology annotation  database goa  <cit>  and literature.

even though we found that the fractions of primary genes are reduced throughout the time course, most  of the genes in the subset were classified as primary genes that do not depend on de novo protein synthesis of upstream regulators . this finding is somewhat surprising, since previous reports have indicated that signal-responsive genes are induced in waves where the group of genes that requires de novo protein synthesis for expression and that is normally expressed in later waves, is far more numerous than the group of early primary response genes  <cit> . one explanation for our apparently conflicting observations implying that a large fraction of delayed and late genes are indeed primary genes, is that we recorded the genome-wide transcriptome at a high number of time points up to  <dig> h and in this way are able to display the gastrin-induced transcriptional cascades at high temporal resolution. this approach revealed that in addition to early genes transcriptionally activated within  <dig> h, also a high proportion of the delayed and late gastrin induced genes were upregulated independently of de novo protein synthesis. the observation that many delayed induced genes were primary genes are in accordance by results from a global time series gene expression analysis in human glioblastoma cells where tullai et al.  <cit>  showed that of the  <dig> genes induced within  <dig> h of human platelet-derived growth factor  treatment,  <dig> were primary immediate early genes and  <dig> were primary delayed genes. detailed analyses of the relation between temporal gene expression profiles beyond  <dig> h and dependence on de novo protein synthesis have to our knowledge not been reported. thus, our present study contributes to shed light on these aspects of growth factor response transcriptional dynamics.

to further characterize the subset of primary and secondary gastrin induced genes that were lower expressed in the transient mode, we annotated their molecular function based on gene ontology  and literature and grouped them into five main categories: regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, transporters, protein binding and enzymes. regulators of gene expression are mainly found among the early and delayed genes, while genes encoding signal transduction proteins are spread throughout all temporal profile groups. late genes are dominated by effectors involved in transport, enzyme and chaperone activity .

the group of late genes upregulated only by sustained gastrin treatment comprises  <dig> primary and  <dig> secondary mrna transcripts. both primary and secondary late gene products are involved in transport and protein binding including chaperone activity. in addition,  <dig> late genes are classified as enzymes . among these, enzymes are possible effector genes specifically associated with processes in the exocrine pancreas: the protease coding genes ctrc, prss <dig>  prss <dig>  sec11c and cela3b are all highly expressed in the pancreatic acinar derived ar42j cell-line. sustained but not transient gastrin treatment significantly enhanced the mrna levels of these enzymes . the genes were not induced in the presence of chx and were therefore classified as secondary gastrin-induced genes. to our knowledge, gastrin has not previously been shown to activate gene expression of these proteases.

proteases can contribute to cancer development by several mechanisms  <cit> . for example, in human pancreatic cancer, prss <dig> upregulates the ligand vegfa via the proteinase-activated receptor  <dig> -mediated erk1/ <dig> pathway; and blockade of prss3-triggered erk signalling is shown to delay the progression of metastasis and prolong the survival of mice bearing prss3-positive human pancreatic tumours  <cit> . others have shown that gastrin enhances vegfa gene expression in human colon cancer cells stably transfected with a wild-type cck <dig> receptor  <cit> . moreover, somatic mutations that increase gastrin/cck <dig> receptor activity increase the secretion of vegf and promote cell migration and angiogenesis in colorectal and gastric cancer cells  <cit> . our findings that upregulation of both prss <dig> and vegfa require sustained gastrin signalling indicate that the proteins encoded by these genes may be involved in hypergastrinemia associated pathophysiological processes .

overall, scrutiny of the  <dig> selected temporal gene expression profiles revealed that the differences in transiently versus sustained treated cells were subtle for early response genes and more substantial for delayed or late gastrin induced genes; and genes that are only upregulated in the sustained mode comprise both primary and secondary genes . exemplified time profiles for primary and secondary genes are shown in figure  <dig>  primary early genes like c-fos and junb were upregulated in both sustained and transiently gastrin treated cells. however, their mrna levels returned to baseline earlier in cells treated in a transient versus a sustained mode . delayed gastrin-responsive genes like primary hdac <dig> and secondary vegfa were also temporarily upregulated in the transient mode compared to unstimulated control at early time points, but only sustained gastrin treatment induced high and prolonged expression . interestingly, both late primary genes like maged <dig> and late secondary genes like prss <dig> and prss <dig> were only detected in cells treated in a sustained mode . this suggests that gastrin directs duration-dependent gene expression via two different routes: i) via signal transduction mechanisms that directly trigger transcriptional activation of primary genes throughout both early and late stages of the time course and ii) via mechanisms that depend on increased expression of transcriptional regulators responsible for upregulation of the late secondary genes.

sustained gastrin treatment is required for extended erk1/ <dig> activation
since our data indicated that a large fraction of gastrin induced genes differentially expressed in transiently versus sustained treated cells are regulated by post-translational direct signalling mechanisms, it was of interest to examine the effect of the duration of gastrin treatment on signalling pathways known to be activated by the gastrin/cck <dig> receptor  <cit> . we therefore analysed akt and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation in cells treated with gastrin in a transient or a sustained mode; starting at  <dig> minutes, i.e.  <dig> min after gastrin was removed in the transient protocol. our results show that whereas erk1/ <dig> activity remains elevated for several hours in cells treated in a sustained mode, the level of phosphorylated erk1/ <dig> returned to base-line within  <dig> min after gastrin was removed in transiently treated cells . the level of phosphorylated akt was low in both untreated and gastrin treated cells in this time period , which is in accordance with finding by others showing that gastrin induced akt phosphorylation peaks 5– <dig> min after treatment in ar42j cells  <cit>  . thus, while akt phosphorylation is not prolonged by sustained gastrin treatment, erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, which is known to involve upstream pkc  <cit> , is strongly elevated at later time points in sustained but not transiently treated cells.

it is well known that the duration of erk1/ <dig> activation is involved in directing cellular outcomes. for example, nerve growth factor  and heregulin  induce prolonged phosphorylation  of erk1/ <dig> and subsequent differentiation in pc- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cells, respectively. epidermal growth factor , on the other hand, induces transient phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and proliferation in the same cells  <cit> . similarly, our findings that sustained gastrin treatment is required for the sustained activation of the pkc /erk1/2-pathway as well as for pkc-dependent activation of anti-apoptosis , indicate that the duration of erk1/ <dig> activation translates duration of gastrin signalling into pro-survival cell fate in the ar42j adenocarcinoma cell model system.

the magnitude of erk activity can be regulated by scaffold proteins  <cit> . we have recently shown that the gastrin induced mapk scaffold protein mek partner  <dig>  is important for gastrin induced phosphorylation of erk <dig> and erk <dig> in the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line ags-gr <cit> . qualitative and quantitative differences in erk activity can also be regulated at the receptor level  <cit> . for example, the egf receptor has been reported to undergo rapid internalization and degradation upon egf stimulation with subsequent transient erk activation  <cit> . less is known about how prolonged gastrin stimulation affect the cck <dig>  receptor. however in our genome-wide time series experiments we find that gastrin induces gene expression of cck2r and that the induction of cck2r mrna is somewhat higher in sustained versus transiently treated cells. the cck2r was highly expressed in the presence of chx which indicates that cck2r is a primary gastrin-induced gene and negatively feedback-regulated at the mrna level . this is in accordance with findings by others showing that gastrin increases cck2r expression at the mrna and protein levels, both in cell cultures  <cit>  and in vivo <cit> . more investigation is needed to address the status of the gastrin receptor upon different duration of gastrin treatment. however, our finding that sustained gastrin treatment induces prolonged erk1/ <dig> activation suggests that the gastrin receptor desensitizes relatively slowly compared to the egf receptor.

molecular responses dependent on sustained gastrin treatment involve ap-1
sustained mek/erk activation is known to enhance the activity of several members of the jun- and fos-family of proteins  <cit>  which are involved in transcription regulation through homo- or heterodimeric ap- <dig> complexes that can also involve proteins from the closely related creb/atf- and maf-families  <cit> . thus, it was of interest to examine the potential involvement of ap- <dig> in gastrin-mediated transcriptional activation of the primary and secondary genes described in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  we found that binding sites for ap <dig>  atf and creb were overrepresented  among primary upregulated genes . none of these transcription factor binding sites were overrepresented among the secondary genes. interestingly, binding sites for ap- <dig> were overrepresented also among primary genes with late expression profiles . these findings indicate that ap- <dig> transcription factors may play a central role in gastrin induced gene expression that requires sustained treatment and is mediated via post translational signalling events independent of de novo protein synthesis.

detailed analysis of junb mrna and protein showed that although the difference at mrna level was subtle , protein levels were substantially higher and more prolonged in cells treated in the sustained mode . a potential mechanism underlying this observation may be stabilization of junb by phosphorylation due to prevention of its degradation via proteasome pathways. such inhibition of proteasome degradation by sustained erk1/ <dig> activation has been reported in other model systems  <cit> . our results suggest that enhanced junb protein levels downstream of erk1/ <dig> signalling may play a decisive role in differential gene expression responses to sustained versus transient gastrin treatment.

to further examine the role of junb, we studied gastrin-induced gene expression in cells where junb had been knocked down by retrovirus-based shrna . the efficiency of the rnai was demonstrated by the fact that junb mrna was suppressed 70% in junb kd compared to control cells  . by focusing our analysis on upr related genes differentially expressed in transiently versus sustained gastrin treated cells , we found that junb knock down suppressed gastrin induced transcriptional activation of the transcription factor atf <dig>  involved in the perk-eif2α pathway of the upr, and the downstream mediator genes herpud <dig> and chac <dig>  gastrin-induced clu mrna levels were similar in junb kd and control cells indicating that junb is not critically involved in the regulation of this gene .

these results suggest that junb is involved in sustained gastrin induced expression of atf <dig> which may subsequently affect downstream atf <dig> mediated gene expression, thus contributing to the differences seen between sustained and transient gastrin treatment. junb can regulate gene transcription both positively and negatively as partners in ap- <dig> dimers  <cit> . the stress induced atf <dig> transcription factor has numerous dimerization partners including members of ap- <dig> and c/ebp family of proteins  <cit> . in addition to herpud <dig> and chac <dig>  atf <dig> is known to mediate upregulation of several of the sustained gastrin regulated genes identified in this work, e.g. atf <dig>  mcl <dig> and vegfa <cit> . recently, junb was found to inhibit stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> , and atf <dig> has been identified as a downstream target of junb in the survival mechanism  <cit> . taken together, our results indicate that the distinct mrna expression patterns in cells treated in transient and sustained modes are, at least in part, linked to the duration of erk1/ <dig> activation and expression of the ap- <dig> components like junb as well as the atf subfamily proteins atf <dig> and atf <dig> for which the mrna expression levels are prolonged only in the sustained mode.

CONCLUSIONS
genome-wide time series analyses are an important approach to capture the dynamics of stimuli-induced gene expression responses over time  <cit> . the major contribution of this study is that we by extensive time series gene expression analysis and molecular studies characterize the distinct effects of duration of gastrin treatment on intracellular signalling events and gene expression in adenocarcinoma cells. we further show that the differences in global gene expression were reflected in distinct cellular responses in transiently and sustained gastrin treated cells since our results point to the possibility that a sustained high level of gastrin may affect the survival/apoptosis balance. our findings may contribute to a better understanding of how gastrin-mediated regulation of gene expression relates to pathophysiological processes in response to high and sustained levels of gastrin. although we have limited our investigation to one cell line in the present study, our findings provide interesting new hypotheses for further studies in vivo as well as other model systems.
