BACKGROUND
the production of purified proteins is important for several experimental approaches aimed to assign gene function including antibody generation for immunocytochemistry and immunoprecipitation studies  <cit> , in vitro mapping of protein – protein, protein – dna or protein – rna interactions  <cit>  and structure determination  <cit> . the availability of proteins is also important for biomedical applications such as small molecule drug discovery and the production of therapeutic proteins and vaccines. in these situations it is essential to be able to reliably express the proteins in a heterologous system and purify them so that they possess the same folds and structure as they would in a natural in vivo state. to achieve this on a whole proteome scale a generic approach must be taken to the expression of protein families, unlike the traditional approach of protein chemistry in optimising the isolation of individual proteins on a case by case basis. e. coli has been the expression system of choice for the majority of laboratories engaged in high-throughput, multi-plexed cloning, expression and purification of proteins for structural genomics  <cit> . the advantages of e. coli as an expression host include well studied physiology, genetics and availability of advanced genetic tools  <cit> , rapid growth, high-level protein production rates achieving up to 10–30% of total cellular protein, ease of handling in a standard molecular biology laboratory, low cost and the ability to multiplex both expression screening  <cit>  and protein production  <cit> . there are however several disadvantages, particularly for eukaryotic proteins, of expression in a prokaryotic system. the lack of eukaryotic chaperones, specialised post-translational modifications, ability to be targeted to sub-cellular locations or to form complexes with stabilising binding partners can result in protein mis-folding and aggregation. for example, when  <dig> randomly selected c. elegans full-length genes were cloned and expressed in e. coli only  <dig> % yielded soluble protein  <cit> . similarly for  <dig> cloned human proteins,  <dig> were expressed solubly and  <dig> purified to homogeneity  <cit> . with the exception of full-length membrane proteins, the property of protein solubility has been shown to be a good indicator of correct folding as determined by functional binding  <cit>  or enzymatic  <cit>  assays. purification of inclusion bodies and in vitro refolding has been used in a number of cases, but refolding conditions are highly protein specific and so unlikely to be useful for high-throughput protein expression.

there are several fall-back strategies for expression of correctly folded eukaryotic proteins in e. coli one of which is to truncate long multi-domain proteins into separate domains, as has been performed for the ephb <dig> receptor  <cit> . reducing translation rates so that proteins have an increased chance of folding into a native state prior to aggregating with folding intermediates, can be successful by lowering the temperature after induction  <cit>  or inducing with lower concentrations of iptg  <cit> . alternate approaches include: co-expressing stabilising binding partners  or chaperones  <cit> ; the induction of chaperones by heat shock  <cit>  or chemical treatment  <cit> ; or the use of genetically modified host-strains that can conduct oxidative protein folding in the cytoplasm  <cit> , over-express rare trnas  <cit>  or lipid rafts  <cit> . perhaps one of the most successful generic strategies to enhance the expression of soluble proteins is the fusion with solubility enhancing tags, such as maltose binding protein , thioredoxin  and glutathione-s-transferase   <cit> .

the aim of this work was to ask if it is possible to derive some general conclusions regarding which expression strategy would most likely result in the expression of soluble, functionally active mammalian protein on a family-by-family or domain-by-domain basis. a deep-mining approach was taken to maximise the chances of successful expression by examining the soluble expression of  <dig> different proteins using  <dig> different expression vectors. this study allowed us to make several conclusions regarding the best strategies to adopt for the soluble expression of different mammalian proteins in bacteria. the conclusions were tested by the expression of an additional  <dig> mammalian proteins.

RESULTS
expression clone construction
the  <dig> proteins chosen for this expression study are listed in table  <dig>  with the exception of gfp, they are all human or mouse proteins, and represent several diverse protein families with extra-cellular, cytoplasmic and nuclear cell locations. the list includes a mixture of full-length and truncated proteins expected to be easy or more challenging to express in a bacterial system. protein truncations were designed to express individual domains annotated from the swissprot  <cit>  or pfam  <cit>  databases or following previous examples of successful expression  <cit> . the genes were isolated from cdna using a nested pcr strategy  <cit>  or provided by the flexgene consortium  and sequence confirmed. a recombinational cloning strategy was employed termed "gateway" cloning  <cit>  based on a modification of the phage lambda site-specific recombination system  <cit> . primers were designed using the nearest neighbour algorithm  <cit>  and open reading frames  were pcr amplified from first strand cdna with 5' attb <dig> and 3' attb <dig> linkers and then recombined with pdonr <dig>  to give a set of entry clones which were sequence confirmed and then recombined with various destination vectors to give the expression constructs. two sets of clones for each orf were generated with and without stop codons for expression with n or c-terminal tags respectively. recombinational cloning was useful in this study where the same set of orfs could be cloned into a large set of different expression vectors without the requirement to check for compatible restriction sites in each vector or their absence within the orfs.

for this study a set of destination vectors were constructed by modifying pet-dest <dig> . the t <dig> promoter was chosen over other promoters commonly used for bacterial expression because of the high specificity and processivity of t <dig> rna polymerase and the wide choice of expression strains currently available. briefly, multicloning sites were created either 5' of the attr <dig> or 3' of the attr <dig> recombination sites for insertion of dna inserts encoding n or c-terminal tags respectively. the expression vectors contained a t7lac promoter  <cit>  for improved control of basal expression. the n-terminal tag expression vectors contained a sequence at the translational start site to provide a partial match with the down-stream box , shown to provide enhancement of translation  <cit>  and a decahistidine  tag for enhanced affinity for nickel resins compared with hexahistidine  tags . a fusion partner was inserted between the h <dig> tag and recombination sites to examine the effect on soluble protein expression. unlike previous tag comparisons  <cit>  here the same promoter and 5'-utr sequence was employed so that any expression differences observed would be purely due to the presence the fusion partner. a vector was also included in this study  with a t <dig> promoter and no downstream lac operator, which would add a h <dig> tag at the n-terminus .

effect of different n-terminal fusions on expression
expression plasmids generated by recombination reactions were used to transform e. coli bl <dig>  an expression strain containing chromosomally integrated t <dig> rna polymerase gene  under the control of the lacuv <dig> promoter. to handle a large number of expression experiments  and associated manipulations to screen for total and soluble expression in e. coli, the recombinational cloning, transformation, growth of expression cultures and cell lysis and filtration separation of insoluble protein were performed in 96-well plate format. figure  <dig> shows western blots for total and soluble protein expression  <dig> hours after induction with  <dig> mm iptg as described in materials and methods. the method for separating total from soluble proteins was based on that of knaust and nordlund  <cit>  and consisted of detergent lysis of harvested cells followed by filtration through a  <dig>  μm 96-well filter plate, which separates larger inclusion bodies from the soluble fraction. the filtration method agrees well with traditional centrifugation methods to separate soluble from insoluble protein  <cit>  and has the advantage that multiple samples can be processed in parallel. quantitation was achieved by separating the proteins by sds-page, electro-blotting onto pvdf membranes and detecting his tagged proteins with an anti-his <dig> monoclonal antibody followed by probing with an anti-mouse cy- <dig> labelled antibody. the advantage of expression analysis by western blot, compared to dot-blots, is that this allows one to quantitate the expression levels of full-length constructs and eliminate the contribution from cleaved protein tag. it was found that western blots based on fluorescence detection  <cit>  gave a greater dynamic range of detection compared with detection based on enzymatic amplification such as horse radish peroxidase . a his-tagged protein molecular weight ladder was used for normalisation to eliminate any blot to blot variation. table  <dig> shows the results of this analysis, quantitating expression yields in terms of mg expressed protein per litre of induction media for total and soluble expression. expression yields greater than  <dig> mg/l are highlighted in bold.

looking first at the results for total  expression, no clear patterns emerge for the various expression vectors used. with the exception of casp <dig>  cdkn2a, trp <dig>  egfr, fos and cd <dig> most proteins expressed well across all expression vectors. interesting differences are apparent however when one looks at the production of soluble protein. using decahistidine green fluorescent protein  or decahistidine glutathione-s-transferase  as fusion partners at the n-terminus gave poor yields of soluble intact product. this may not be because they were poor at promoting soluble expression but because they were prone to proteolysis during cell lysis reducing the yield of full-length soluble protein. a set of proteins , hras, mdm <dig>  ephb <dig> and ccnd2) gave high soluble expression levels in the baseline n-terminal decahistidine vector, which was not improved when expressed as decahistidine thioredoxin  or decahistidine maltose binding protein  fusions. the molecular weight of these proteins ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> kda and averaged  <dig>  kda. these proteins are all expressed in the cytoplasm, have an average of  <dig> low-complexity region,  <dig>  contiguous hydrophobic amino acids , pi of  <dig> , grand average of hydropathicity index  of - <dig> ,  <dig> % cysteine residues and no coiled-coil structures. a second grouping of proteins was observed where soluble expression was improved when expressed as h10-trx or h10-mbp fusions compared with the h <dig> tag alone. this grouping included grb <dig>  efnb <dig>  mad, max, efna <dig> . the molecular weight of these proteins ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> kda and averaged  <dig>  kda. these proteins were a mixture of those expressed in the cytoplasm, nucleus and extra-cellular, have an average of  <dig>  low-complexity regions,  <dig>  contiguous hydrophobic amino acids , pi of  <dig> , gravy score of - <dig>  and  <dig> % cysteines. a third set of proteins resulted in almost undetectable soluble expression with a h <dig> tag but good expression with h10-trx or h10-mbp fusions. these included cdk <dig>  fli <dig>  cdkn-1b, mdm <dig>  gata <dig>  ephb <dig> and casp <dig> with molecular weights ranging from  <dig>  –  <dig>  kda, with an average molecular weight of  <dig>  kda. these proteins were also a mixture cytoplasmic, nuclear and extra-cellular proteins, have an average of  <dig> low-complexity regions,  <dig> contiguous hydrophobic amino acids , pi of  <dig> , gravy score of - <dig>  and  <dig> % cysteines. finally a set of proteins was grouped , trp <dig>  cd44) where very low  soluble full-length expression was observed, even when expressed as mbp or trx fusions. here the molecular weight ranged from  <dig>  –  <dig>  kda and averaged  <dig>  kda. these proteins were a mixture of those expressed in the cytoplasm, nucleus and extra-cellular, have an average of  <dig> low-complexity regions,  <dig>  contiguous hydrophobic amino acids , pi of  <dig> , gravy score of - <dig>  and  <dig> % cysteine content.

comparing the  <dig> mammalian proteins where there are examples in all  <dig> expression vectors the average yields of soluble protein for the h <dig>  h10-gfp, h10-gst, h10-trx and h10-mbp tags are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg per litre of culture. this ranks the ability of the tag fusions to produce full-length soluble protein as h10-trx ~ h10-mbp > h <dig> > h10-gst > h10-gfp. the pdest <dig> vector  was dramatically poorer at expressing soluble protein compared with the vector pn <dig> , with average soluble expression yields of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mg per litre of culture respectively. both vectors contain t <dig> rna polymerase promoters, but pn <dig> also contains a lac operator  downstream of the promoter and the gene encoding the lac repressor  for tighter control of gene expression. this may result in a faster rate of transcript synthesis, after induction with iptg, and hence translation rates  for pdest <dig> compared with pn <dig>  if translation rate exceeds the rate of protein folding, then increased production of insoluble protein would occur.

effect of different c-terminal fusions on expression
a similar study was performed where the  <dig> orfs were cloned into  <dig> different c-terminal tag expression vectors shown in figure  <dig>  c-terminal fusions studied here included v5-h <dig> or h <dig> or protein fusions mbp, gst, trx, murine or human dihydrofolate reductase , all with h <dig> at the c-terminus. the expression screen and quantitation of total and soluble protein expression was performed as for the n-terminal tag study. figure  <dig> shows the fluorescence western blots for this c-terminal tag study. here a greater number of constructs were observed with either undetectable or low levels of expression compared with the n-terminal tag study. table  <dig> quantitates the western blot data for the intact fusion products, with expression yields greater than  <dig> mg/l in bold. the last row of the table describes the average expression yield for each c-terminal fusion partner. for total protein expression levels there are large expression level differences observed between the various c-terminal tags. the c-terminal decahistidine tag was particularly poor here with an average total expression yield of only  <dig>  mg/l compared with  <dig>  mg/l when this tag was fused to the n-terminus. in contrast the c-terminal mbp-h <dig> tag resulted in an average total expression yield of  <dig>  mg/l. the ranking of the c-terminal fusion partners in promoting total expression was mbp-h <dig> > gst-h <dig> > v5-h <dig> > trx-h <dig> > dhfr-h <dig> > dhfr-h <dig> > gfp-h <dig> > h <dig> 

mbp-h <dig> was the most effective tag at the c-terminus to promote protein solubility with an average construct full-length soluble yield of  <dig>  mg/l, which compares well with an average of  <dig>  mg/l when this tag is fused at the n-terminus. the order of c-terminal tags to promote soluble expression was similar for total expression: mbp-h <dig> > gst-h <dig> > v5-h <dig> > dhfr-h <dig> ~ gfp-h <dig> ~ trx-h <dig> > h <dig> ~ dhfr-h <dig>  thioredoxin was not as effective a solubility enhancing tag when fused at the c-terminus with an average soluble yield of only  <dig>  mg/l compared with  <dig>  mg/l when fused to the n-terminus.

several correlations with protein features are seen when one groups the mpb fusions according to soluble protein expression levels. for the first group, where soluble expression levels were in the range of  <dig> –  <dig> mg/l, the average molecular weight, pi and gravy score were  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively. the average numbers of contiguous hydrophobic amino acids, low complexity and coiled-coil regions were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the second group displayed soluble expression levels between  <dig> –  <dig> mg/l. here, the average molecular weight, pi and gravy score were  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively and the average numbers of contiguous hydrophobic amino acids, low complexity and coiled-coil regions were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> respectively. the last group displayed soluble expression levels between  <dig> –  <dig> mg / l. here the average molecular weight, pi and gravy score were  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  and - <dig>  respectively and the average numbers of contiguous hydrophobic amino acids, low complexity and coiled-coil regions were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. there were representatives of nuclear, cytoplasmic and extra-cellular proteins in all three groupings.

expression of a test set of  <dig> mammalian proteins
a diverse set of proteins were chosen to test the conclusions of this study . they range from proteins that are well annotated, some of which have been expressed in e. coli previously , to those that contain no pfama domains and have not been expressed in e. coli previously . they included  <dig> proteins not annotated as pfama domains, with unknown function. all cdnas were amplified from a primary cdna library, cloned into pdonr <dig> and sequence confirmed prior to transfer to pdest-n112-mbp  for expression as n-terminal h10-mbp fusions. in some cases primers were designed to clone protein fragments to express particular pfama domains or minimise the molecular weight or numbers of low complexity  regions or contiguous hydrophobic amino acids . for proteins with no pfama annotations, such as bc <dig>  smart sequence analysis  <cit>  was performed to identify the low complexity regions of the protein and truncations performed accordingly. protein expression and quantitation of intact soluble fusion protein product was performed as for the n- and c-terminal tag comparison study. the total and soluble expression levels  are listed in the last column of table  <dig> together with selected protein features.  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins yielded soluble expression levels of greater than  <dig> mg/l and the average molecular weight, number of lc regions and hp_aa for these proteins was  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. for the  <dig> proteins that failed to give soluble product of the correct size, the average molecular weight, number of lc regions and hp_aa was  <dig>  kda,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.

discussion
correlation between protein properties and solubility
to guide future expression strategies for new proteins, particularly regarding the choice of expressing a full-length protein in a bacterial or eukaryotic system and also where to truncate multi-domain containing proteins, it is interesting to investigate if the proteins expressed in a soluble form in this study share any common properties. recently goh et al.  <cit>  used data generated by a structural genomics consortium to examine the ability of proteins to progress from cloning to expression and purification to crystallisation. the data used was very large, consisting of  <dig>  targets from over  <dig> organisms and a number of important features were inferred that correlated with success including percentage composition of charged residues, occurrence of hydrophobic patches and length. although a large study, there was a problem with interpretation of all the data-sets as it was unclear whether targets were simply waiting in the pipeline or had failed. also structural genomics targets are often initially biased in favour of easy to express proteins, not representative of the whole proteomes of these organisms.

the present study, focused on mammalian proteins from several diverse families, examined the relationship between successful soluble expression with various protein properties. several protein features were identified in this study to correlate with soluble expression, which had not previously been shown experimentally. for both the n and c-terminal tag expression studies it was observed that the presence of several features did not correlate with successful expression including protein pi, grand average of hydropathicity index   <cit> , sub-cellular location, the cysteine content as a percentage of the total number of amino acids and the number of coiled-coils. protein pi has been linked to sub-cellular location  <cit>  with a bimodal distribution observed in bacterial and archaeal genomes and trimodal pattern in eukaryotes. proteins are thought to be less soluble at a ph environment near their pi. gravy simply calculates overall hydrophobicity of the linear polypeptide sequence with increasing positive score indicating greater hydrophobicity, but no account is taken of the way the protein folds in three dimensions or the percentage of residues buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein. in a recent study luan et al.  <cit>  tested the soluble expression of  <dig>  full-length c. elegans orfs and found that protein hydrophobicity was an important factor for an orf to yield a soluble expression product. this different result may be attributable to the fact that the c. elegans study included a greater proportion of membrane proteins. therefore the lack of correlation between gravy score and soluble expression we observed may be true for non-membrane proteins or for proteins where the trans-membrane domain has been deleted.

there was a strong correlation between successful soluble expression and molecular weight of the protein. small proteins with an average molecular weight of  <dig>  kda did not require to be fused with solubility enhancing proteins for soluble expression whereas proteins that required to be fused with n-terminal mbp or trx for soluble expression had an average molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and those where the addition of a n-terminal fusion could not rescue soluble expression had an average size of  <dig>  kda. the same pattern also emerged in the c-terminal fusion study. the decreasing probability of successful soluble expression of mammalian proteins with increasing molecular weight is likely due to increasing protein complexity, perhaps requiring specialised eukaryotic chaperones for folding or stabilising binding partners. the majority of proteins solubly expressed in this study contained single domains and as fusion proteins were either capable of self-folding or were folded with the aid of prokaryotic chaperones. braun et al. found a similar relationship with their set of  <dig> human proteins with  <dig> different n-terminal fusions  <cit> .

a correlation in this study was observed between increasing numbers of contiguous hydrophobic amino  acids  and soluble expression. this ranged from an average of  <dig>  hp_aa for those proteins not requiring a n-terminal fusion for high level soluble expression to  <dig> hp_aa for proteins requiring a n-terminal fusion for successful expression and  <dig>  hp_aa where expression failed under the conditions described here. this pattern was also repeated in the c-terminal fusion study where good expression proteins had an average of  <dig>  hp_aa whereas poor expression proteins had an average of  <dig> hp_aa. in a study of the sequences of  <dig> non-membrane proteins it was found that the sequences of three or more consecutive hydrophobic residues are suppressed in globular proteins  <cit> . low complexity regions of proteins are regions of a protein of biased composition containing a small number of amino acids  <cit>  and can have a disordered structure important for protein function  <cit> . here we found that the greater the number of low complexity regions contained within the target protein, the less likely soluble expression would be achieved. this was true for both the n- and c-terminal fusion protein studies with  <dig>  –  <dig> low complexity regions for proteins easy to express in a soluble form to  <dig>  –  <dig> low complexity regions for proteins difficult to express. low complexity regions are less common in bacterial proteins and these may be targets for proteolytic degradation in vivo.

some interesting conclusions were drawn when soluble expression was measured for an additional set of  <dig> mammalian proteins expressed as h10-mbp fusions . in several cases  truncating the proteins to minimise the molecular weight and the numbers of low complexity regions and contiguous hydrophobic amino acids made the difference between failed expression and good soluble protein expression. for proteins such as bc <dig>  with no annotated pfama domains, it was found that truncating at low complexity regions was a good method to identify a fragment that could express in a soluble form of the correct size . although we found that successful soluble expression of the  <dig> protein set correlated with lower molecular weight, number of low complexity regions and contiguous hydrophobic amino acids compared with proteins that failed to express solubly with the correct size, validating our earlier conclusions, there were some exceptions. for example elf <dig> and gata <dig> both expressed well despite having  <dig> and  <dig> low complexity regions respectively and molecular weights of  <dig> and  <dig>  kda, whereas some smaller proteins such as the pdz domains of dlgh <dig> and grip <dig> failed to express. it may be that there are additional protein features, such as the ability to form a stabilising interaction with a binding partner, that are also important for soluble expression. also ensuring correct protein domain boundaries may be important since the annotated pfam domain boundaries, based on sequence alignment, do not always match the structural or folding domain boundaries.

protein fusions that enhance protein solubility
there have been three comparative studies recently where sets of proteins were cloned into several expression vectors and the effects of the fusion partner on total and soluble expression yield were examined. hammarstrom et al.  <cit>  cloned  <dig> human proteins  into various expression vectors and ranked the tags ability to promote soluble expression as trx ~ mbp ~ gb <dig> > zz > nusa > gst > his <dig>  another study ranked tags in terms of increased expression and yield after purification as gst ~ mbp > cbp > his <dig> when comparing the expression of  <dig> human proteins where the molecular weight varied from  <dig> –  <dig> kda. <cit>  here gst was preferred because of the weak affinity between mbp and amylose resin. in a third study of  <dig> different proteins  with  <dig> different tags mbp gave the best overall results in terms of total and soluble expression  <cit> . however, these studies used different combinations of promoter and fusion partner, so it was unclear whether the observed effect was purely due to expression with the fusion partner or variable rates of transcript synthesis that would also affect translation rates.

in this study it was found that, on average, n-terminal fusion partners are preferable for optimal protein expression. when proteins are expressed with their native n-terminus, as in our c-terminal fusion proteins, total expression levels can be more variable than when expressed with a constant n-terminal tag. this may be because of variable rna secondary structures in the region around the start codon which could interfere with ribosome binding. an additional explanation is that during translation the expressed protein emerges from the ribosome first and initiates an incorrect, irreversible, folding pathway before the soluble fusion partner has been translated and folded. the mis-folded protein would be ubiquitin labelled and targeted to the proteasome for degradation resulting in lower total expression levels. this scenario is more likely when expressing mammalian proteins in a bacterial system which lacks specific eukaryotic chaperone proteins. it has been shown previously that proteins prone to mis-folding and aggregation can arrest gfp folding when fused at the c-terminus  <cit> . however, when the soluble protein is fused at the n-terminus, this would be translated first and perhaps increase the solubility of the downstream protein domain folding intermediates, increasing their half lives prior to irreversible aggregation. this would allow greater reversibility in the individual steps along the folding pathway and increase the probability that the protein would eventually reach the lowest free energy native conformation.

it was found that trx and mbp were the best n-terminal protein fusions to promote protein solubility. the best c-terminal fusion to promote protein solubility was mbp and this may be acting as a true intra-molecular chaperone  <cit> , able to promote folding of the n-terminal protein fusion. the mechanism could be due to direct binding to folding intermediates  <cit> , allowing stabilisation prior to correct folding and inhibition of aggregate formation. the observation that mbp was effective at enhancing soluble expression when fused at the c-terminus, in contrast to thioredoxin, suggests that mbp can actually reverse the process of incorrect folding that would have started prior to the translation of the downstream mbp. this property was not observed for thioredoxin when fused to the c-terminus suggesting either that, in three-dimensions, different proximal faces of the fusion partners have different solubility enhancing properties or that thioredoxin does not posses any chaperone properties and acts only as a solubility enhancer. alternatively, the folding of thioredoxin may be more prone to inhibition than mbp. also there are examples where mbp fusions can form soluble inclusion bodies  <cit> , and this cannot be ruled out as a possibility here, although there are also several examples where mbp fusion proteins are fully functionally active  <cit> .

it must be stressed here that although protein solubility is a useful indicator of correct folding, additional measurements need to be performed to give supporting evidence for correct folding. these may include removing the protein fusion with a protease and analysis of the cleaved protein of interest by a variety of biophysical and functional assays such as analysis of monodispersity by light scattering  <cit> , nmr  <cit> , cd spectropolarimetry, bis-ans binding  <cit> , ligand binding or enzymatic activity. in this study a protease cleavage site was not included in the vector constructs because the main use of the proteins generated in our laboratory will be in high-throughput antibody production where the cleavage of the fusion partner is unnecessary.

gfp did not significantly enhance soluble protein expression when fused to the c-terminus of the proteins in this study, supporting the use of this tag as an indicator of soluble protein expression of fused orfs. <cit>  the observation that the v5-his <dig> tag resulted in a higher average soluble expression level than the his <dig> tag  indicates that the identity of the peptide tag can also affect overall solubility of expressed proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
what guidelines have emerged from this study in developing a strategy for the production of soluble mammalian proteins in e. coli? if the protein has a molecular weight of less than  <dig> kda and contains  <dig> or less low complexity regions and less than  <dig> contiguous hydrophobic amino acids expression of the full-length protein in e. coli should give good levels of soluble protein. as a generic strategy we would recommend expressing the protein with a fusion partner and found mbp and trx to be the best fusions to enhance protein solubility as n-terminal tags with mbp being superior as a c-terminal fusion. c-terminal fusions are desirable for proteins such as the p450s where n-terminal tags can inhibit functional activity. when fused to an optimal fusion partner, nuclear, cytoplasmic and extra-cellular domains were equally likely to be expressed solubly. for larger proteins over  <dig> kda, truncations should be considered to express specific protein domains and to minimise the molecular weight, number of low complexity regions and contiguous hydrophobic amino acids. in conclusion, this study will help enable a systematic expansion in the number mammalian proteins and domains that can be successfully expressed in e. coli as soluble product, and also predict which are best targeted for a eukaryotic expression system.
