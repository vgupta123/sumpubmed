BACKGROUND
the de novo synthesis of bile salts from cholesterol primarily occurs in the liver of vertebrates in a series of reactions catalyzed by over  <dig> enzymes. bile salts are secreted via the biliary system into the intestine where they facilitate absorption of lipids. small amounts  of these bile salts that are not returned to the liver via enterohepatic circulation are excreted from the body with waste  <cit> . known additionally for their regulatory function, the enterohepatic circulation and metabolism of bile salts maintains cholesterol homeostasis and minimizes the cytotoxic effects of these compounds  <cit> . studies of the sea lamprey , a member of the extant phylum chordata, superclass agnatha, have shown yet another function of bile salts – acting as pheromones that aid in chemical communication among conspecifics  <cit> .

dramatic alterations in the synthesis and excretion route of bile salts occur in the sea lamprey throughout its life history  <cit> . upon reaching the reproductive stage, sea lamprey no longer feed, and the intestinal tract becomes highly atrophied  <cit> . male sea lamprey have been shown to secrete bile salts and steroids through gill epithelia after sexual maturation  <cit> . three of these compounds have been identified as 3-keto allocholic acid , 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate , and petromyzestrosterol  <cit> . 3kpzs has been shown to attract sexually mature females to the odorant source in streams, acting as a sex pheromone  <cit> .

in larval sea lamprey, bile salts are excreted through the urogenital pore. the filter-feeding larvae residing in streams excrete a lamprey-specific bile acid petromyzonol sulfate , and its putative precursor allocholic acid – aca  <cit> , as metabolic by-products with their feces. both compounds are similar in structure to 3kaca and 3kpzs, respectively, but contain a hydroxyl group in place of the keto group at carbon- <dig>  position. sorensen et al.  <cit>  identified two additional larval compounds: petromyzonamine disulfate  and petromyzosterol disulfate . each compound examined  has been shown to stimulate the olfactory epithelium of migratory adults in electro-olfactogram recordings  <cit> .

during a sea lampreys transformation from larval to adult life stage, complex and specific regulation of biosynthesis, transport, and secretion is likely required to promote physiologic functions  <cit> . we reasoned that sea lamprey have evolved physiological adaptations whereby conversion and excretion of bile salts are modified across life stages to exert various functions. we hypothesized that the life stage-specific secretion of pheromonal bile salts from mature male sea lamprey is due to changes in the biosynthetic and transportation pathway. in this study we present evidence of dramatic upregulation of bile salt synthesis in the liver of male sea lamprey after sexual maturation, transportation of these compounds to the gills via the bloodstream, and additional modification of pzs to 3kpzs in gill epithelia before secretion of 3kpzs into the environment as a mating pheromone.

RESULTS
tissue distribution of bile salts
there are relatively minor variations in the distribution of bile salts across liver, plasma, and gills of immature males . in im, pads was the most abundant compound detected, and its concentrations did not differ across tissues and plasma samples . in im, pads was detected at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g  in liver,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/l in plasma, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g in gill. pzs was the second most abundant compound detected, with concentrations that varied across tissues and plasma . mean concentration of pzs in the liver of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g was greater than mean plasma or gill concentrations of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/l and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g, respectively . 3kpzs, 3kaca, and aca mean concentrations were lower and did not differ within each compound across liver, plasma or gills of im .

in sexually mature males , there are pronounced variations in the distribution of bile salts across liver, plasma and gills. the most abundant compound detected in sm was pzs. there were significant differences in pzs concentrations across tissues and plasma . mean concentration of pzs was highest in liver tissues of sm at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g, which was higher than a mean plasma concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/l-plasma) and mean gill concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g, respectively . mean concentrations of bile salts differed across tissues and plasma for 3kpzs , 3kaca , and pads ; however, concentrations of aca did not differ across tissues and plasma .

there were also dramatic differences in tissue distributions of bile salts between im and sm . concentrations of pzs and 3kpzs were greater in liver, gill, and plasma of sm compared to im. compound aca was detected in greater concentrations within liver and plasma of sm, compared to im; however, there was no difference in gill concentrations of aca between the two maturation stages. compound pads was detected in greater concentrations within liver of sm, compared to im. there was no difference in gill or plasma concentrations of pads between the two maturation stages. concentrations of 3kaca were not different within liver, gill, and plasma of sm, compared to im .

the compound and specific tissue compared between im and sm are listed. compounds include 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate , 3-keto allocholic acid , petromyzonol sulfate , allocholic acid , and petromyzonamine disulfate . actual concentrations can be seen in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  bold font indicate significant differences between im and sm .

release rate of bile salts
sexually mature males released bile salts at substantially greater rates compared to immature males. compounds 3kpzs, pzs, 3kaca, aca, and pads are released from the gills of sm, confirming previous findings for 3kpzs  <cit> , and 3kaca  <cit> . compound 3kpzs was released at the highest mean rate at  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g-body weight/hr  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/g-body weight/hr . release rates of aca, 3kaca, pads, and pzs ranged between 30– <dig> times lower than 3kpzs. there was no significant difference between whole body and head only release rates of 3kpzs , 3kaca , pzs , aca , or pads . these results combined indicate that all detected bile salts were mainly released from the head region of sm.

the release rates of all tested compounds from head, tail, or full body washings of im were below  <dig>  ng/g-body weight/hr. compounds detected  were released within the range of  <dig>  and  <dig>  ng/g-body weight/hr. larval compound psds, known to stimulate the olfactory epithelium of migratory adult conspecifics  <cit> , was not detected in sm or im tissues or wash-water during this study suggesting that this compound is unique to larval sea lamprey. none of the six bile salts examined were detected in control washings across all chamber types and maturation stages.

tissue and maturation-specific gene expression
the three genes examined that encode for members of the cytochrome p <dig> monooxygenases were expressed at the highest level in the liver tissue of sm. specifically, cyp7a <dig> was expressed over 8000-fold greater in the liver tissue of sm compared to liver of im and over 600-fold greater compared to gill tissues of im and sm . cyp27a <dig> was expressed greater than threefold in the liver tissue of sm compared to liver of im and greater than 90-fold compared to gill tissues of im and sm . cyp8b <dig> was expressed six-fold greater in the liver tissue of sm compared to liver of im and over 160-fold greater compared to gill tissues of im and sm . expression of genes that encode for the bile salt export pump and sodium/bile salt cotransporters suggested that bile salt was transported from the liver to the gill. bsep showed greater expression in the sm liver at over twofold that of im liver and over 7000-fold that of sm and im gill . slc10a <dig> was expressed greater than 13-fold in im and sm liver compared to gills of both maturities , while slc10a <dig> was expressed over 25-fold greater in the gills of im and sm compared to liver . additional bile salt modification such as the conversion of the 3-keto group and sulfate conjugation in the gills was also supported. both sult2b1and sult2a <dig> were expressed greater than 10-fold in gills of sm compared to liver of sm and im . hsd3b <dig> was expressed greater than 20-fold in sm and im gill tissue compared to all other tissues and maturities . references sult1c <dig> mrna  and 40s ribosomal rna  were not significantly different across liver and gill of both im and sm .

discussion
our results provide evidence of a dramatic upregulation of biosynthetic enzymes cyp7a <dig>  cyp27a <dig> <cit> , and the bile salt pool, in the male liver after sexual maturation . the upregulation may be an adaptive mechanism that satisfies a specific need to synchronize reproduction at the final life stage. in addition, a high concentration of several bile salts, mainly pzs, were found in the cardiac blood suggesting that a large amount of bile salts are transported to the gills. a likely route of bile salt transport to the gills is through hepatic veins that carry blood from the liver directly to the heart, which in turn pumps blood through the gills  <cit> . this system of bile salt transport in mature sea lamprey appears different from larval sea lamprey that actively filter feed in stream environments. as a result of circulating a bile salt pool from intestine to liver – i.e. enterohepatic circulation which plays a large role in cholesterol homeostasis  <cit> , larval sea lamprey lose 5% of bile salts primarily as metabolic by-products with their waste  <cit> . adult sea lamprey have been hypothesized to use these larval compounds as migratory cues  <cit> , although the behavioral function of specific larval components remain to be characterized  <cit> . in the case of adult sea lamprey that have ceased feeding for close to two months  <cit> , bile salts are not needed for digestion at this stage. on the contrary, certain bile salts such as 3kpzs are used as sex pheromones in mature sea lamprey  <cit> .

our lc–ms/ms analyses and gene expression data suggest that pzs is converted into 3kpzs in the gill epithelia. the dramatic inverse of pzs to 3kpzs ratios from inside to outside the body is strong evidence for this final conversion. pzs is present in higher concentrations in the liver, plasma, and gill tissues compared to 3kpzs, yet 3kpzs is secreted into the environment at the greatest rate of bile salts analyzed. furthermore, hsd3b <dig> is dominantly expressed in the gill tissue of adult male sea lamprey. taken together, these results support the mechanism whereby pzs is dehydrogenated at c- <dig> to form 3kpzs, a reaction catalyzed by enzyme hsd3b <dig>  <cit> , in the gill tissue before secretion into the environment. interestingly, both sult2b1and sult2a <dig> were expressed substantially greater in the gill tissues compared to liver tissues of adult males. sult2b1and sult2a <dig> encode for enzymes that catalyze the sulfate conjugation of steroid hormones  and bile acids . sulfation increases the solubility of these compounds and facilitates secretion into the aquatic environment  <cit> .

tissue-specific expressions of putative bile salt transporter genes suggest that these putative transporters may play a role in gill excretion of bile salts in both im and sm sea lamprey. in these life stages, lamprey do not recycle bile salts through enterohepatic circulation because the developmental biliary atresia during metamorphosis has closed the exocrine biliary pole of hepatocytes which are reorganized into solid cords  <cit> . for male adults to excrete pheromones, transporters need to provide mechanisms for the bile salts to exit hepatocytes as well as to enter and to exit gill epithelial cells. expression of bsep, which encodes for an atp-dependent bile salt export pump  that is known for secretions of bile salts out of the hepatocytes  <cit> , remained substantially high in the liver of both maturation states. as expected, the bsep mrna level specifically increased in the lamprey liver from im to sm, corresponding with the up-regulation of bile salt synthesis seen in sms. in contrast, slc10a <dig>  which encodes for a cotransporter that is responsible for uptake of bile salts into hepatocytes from blood, decreased from im to sm males. this decrease might be a means for sm lamprey to elevate the blood pzs level, driving the bile salt toward the gills and away from a futile cycle back to the liver. interestingly, slc10a <dig>  encoding for a cotransporter primarily responsible for uptake of bile salts by apical cells lining the lumen of the small intestine  <cit> , is expressed at a high level in the gill of adult males. transporter slc10a <dig> has been shown to have a high affinity for 5α-bile alcohols such as 3kpzs in lamprey  <cit> . it is possible that this na+/bile salt cotransporter may play a role in gill uptake of bile salts from circulation.

although our gene expression data are consistent with lc–ms/ms data in supporting a hypothesis for the hepatic synthesis and gill excretion of bile salts in sm sea lamprey, several caveats need to be addressed in future studies. first, the function of bsep and slc10a <dig> in transporting 5α-bile alcohols needs to be confirmed. the specific cellular locations of transporters  in the liver and gill should also be examined. second, the transporter that transport bile salts into water from gill cells need to be identified. third, the enzymes involved with synthesis of c <dig> bile alcohols warrant an extensive study. lampreys are unusual in producing both c <dig> and c <dig> bile alcohols as all other non-bony fish produce only c <dig> bile alcohols  <cit> . it is likely that the enzymatic mechanisms to cleavage side chains of cholesterol in producing c <dig> bile alcohols in sea lamprey is different from the multiple peroxisomal enzymes that produce c <dig> bile salts in human and rodent  <cit> . once identified, the genes encoding these lamprey enzymes are expected to change in parallel with cyp7a <dig> and cyp8b <dig>  both of which were found to increase dramatically from im to sm lamprey.

CONCLUSIONS
we show for the first time that a dramatic upregulation of cyp7a <dig>  cyp27a <dig>  and cyp8b <dig> occurs primarily in the liver of male sea lamprey after reaching sexual maturation. higher expression of hsd3b <dig>  sult2b <dig>  and sult2a <dig> in gills of adult male sea lamprey suggest that additional bile salt modification occurs in gill tissues that may be associated with the conversion of pzs to 3kpzs. our lc–ms/ms data on tissue distribution and release rates of bile salts support the theory of pzs to 3kpzs conversion in gills . we provide evidence for an example of a complex mechanism of bile salt biosynthesis and excretion that has been evolved to endow an additional function of a bile salt as a potent mating pheromone.
