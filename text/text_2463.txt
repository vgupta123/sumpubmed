BACKGROUND
the genus aeromonas comprises a collection of gram-negative bacteria that are widespread in aquatic environments and that have been implicated as causative agents of a number of human and animal diseases. a. hydrophila, a. veronii biovar sobria, a. caviae, a. jandaei, a. veronii biovar veronii, a. schubertii and a. trota have been associated with various human infections including gastroenteritis, wound infections and septicaemia  <cit> . aeromonas salmonicida, a non-motile aeromonad, is the aetiological agent of a bacterial septicaemia in fish, called furunculosis  <cit> . furunculosis is an important disease in wild and cultured stocks of salmonid and other fish species and can have significant negative economic impacts on aquaculture operations. motile aeromonas species have also been implicated as the causative agents of various fish septicemias  <cit> . a. hydrophila is also associated with red leg disease in amphibians and infections in turtles  <cit>  and birds  <cit> .

in addition to their role as disease agents, aeromonas species can be found in non-pathogenic association with a variety of animals  <cit> . most aeromonas species are opportunistic pathogens, entering through wounds or affecting only stressed or otherwise immunocompromised hosts  <cit> . a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, however, is a specific pathogen of salmonid fish and is capable of causing disease in healthy fish at very low levels of infection . although bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology  <cit>  recognizes five subspecies of a. salmonicida: salmonicida, achromogenes, masoucida, smithia, and pectinolytica, many laboratories currently classify a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida as "typical" and any isolate deviating phenotypically as "atypical". hosts for atypical strains include a wide variety of non-salmonid fish, as well as salmonids  <cit> . on the basis of dna relatedness, a. salmonicida also includes a group of mesophilic, motile strains isolated from humans  <cit> . morphological and biochemical differences such as pigment production, colony size and growth rate, haemolysis, and sucrose fermentation  <cit>  are used to distinguish typical and atypical isolates. a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida  isolates grow well on blood agar with large colonies, produce a brown diffusible pigment, are haemolytic and do not ferment sucrose  <cit> . historically, typical strains are thought to be extremely homogenous  <cit> , and therefore any deviation in any of these characteristics has been considered enough evidence to classify a strain as "atypical"  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences  <cit>  or biochemical analyses based on carbohydrates  <cit>  appear to be better able to sort out the complex taxonomy and classification of a. salmonicida subspecies and related species.

a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida appears to be an example of the evolution of pathogen specificity for a particular host from within a group of mainly opportunistic pathogens or commensal bacteria. it thus provides opportunities to identify genes involved in host invasion and virulence and to investigate the evolution of host specificity. in this communication, the genome, including both the chromosome and large plasmids, of an isolate of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida is characterized. the three small plasmids of this strain have been described previously  <cit> . genes associated with virulence are identified and comparisons with the genome of a. hydrophila atcc 7966t  <cit>  provide insights into the changes in the genome that may be associated with adaptation to fish hosts. the genome sequence is an essential tool for the understanding of the infection process of a. salmonicida.

RESULTS
genome features
the genome of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig>  consists of a single circular chromosome, two large plasmids and three small plasmids. the  <dig> , <dig> bp chromosome has a g+c content of  <dig> % and contains  <dig> genes, with  <dig> encoding proteins . generally, the chromosome matches the restriction map previously constructed for this strain  <cit> , although there are differences in the placement of some genes. the chromosome has a number of major structural features. the origin of replication , as inferred from the presence of multiple dnaa binding sites and gc skew, occurs at  <dig> –  <dig>  which is approximately  <dig>  bp from dnaa . replication terminates near  <dig> as judged by gc skew and the presence of a dif-like sequence, which has been recently implicated as the dna replication terminus  <cit> . gc skew also detected the presence of a large inversion  that appears to have occurred between two identical insertion sequences. pcr analysis confirmed that this inversion was not due to misassembly of the sequence . in addition, two prophages have been detected by similarity to phage genes , but these regions of the chromosome do not show any obvious alteration in g+c content.

twenty-eight ribosomal rna genes are encoded on the chromosome, arranged in nine operons, with one operon containing an extra copy of the 5s rrna gene . the nine operons are arranged around the origin of replication so as to be transcribed in the same direction as replication proceeds. small variations  in sequence occur between the copies of the rrna genes, with only the "extra" 5s rrna gene  having  <dig> bp that vary when compared to the other copies. a total of  <dig> trna genes are encoded on the a <dig> chromosome, most of which are present in at least two copies, and some of which occur in clusters of multiple tandem copies, similar to the a. hydrophila genome  <cit> . there are single genes for tryptophan  and selenocysteine trnas as well as a suppressor trna that translates tag codons as tryptophan. this suppressor trna differs from the trnw sequence at only two bases, one of which is in the anticodon. twenty-one protein coding genes appear to use the suppressor trna to allow the translation of the encoded protein. analysis of the genome to identify small non-coding rna features that regulate gene expression by binding to rna or proteins  <cit>  revealed the presence of nine small rnas. in addition,  <dig> riboswitches, which regulate translation through the detection of small molecules  <cit> , were detected near the 5' ends of genes they presumably regulate.

two striking aspects of the a <dig> genome are the presence of large numbers of insertion sequences   and pseudogenes  on the chromosome and two large plasmids. ten different types of is are found in multiple copies in the a <dig> genome  with isas <dig> present in  <dig> complete copies. one is previously identified in aeromonas species   <cit>  is not present in the a <dig> genome. in addition to the  <dig> complete is elements,  <dig> partial is sequences are present. this observation along with the finding that some is are located within other is, suggests that these dynamic elements have undergone recent transposition. insertion sequences have also contributed to the apparent formation of pseudogenes, with more than  <dig> genes being interrupted by is elements. most pseudogenes, however, are created by small  deletions or sequence duplications, although several genes have larger deletions. additional pseudogenes appear to have arisen through mutations that introduce in-frame stop codons . these observations are in marked contrast to the a. hydrophila genome  <cit> , which has no is elements and only seven pseudogenes.

both large plasmids contain genes involved in replication, plasmid partition and conjugative transfer. plasmid  <dig>  carries an origin of replication that can be propagated in e. coli, since this plasmid was isolated by transformation of e. coli with a plasmid dna extract from a <dig>  this plasmid also contains a tn <dig> composite transposon   <cit>  that carries genes for resistance to mercury as well as an in <dig> integron encoding resistance to streptomycin/spectinomycin, quaternary ammonia compounds, sulphonamides and chloramphenicol . the tn <dig> sequence has a considerably higher g+c content  than the remainder of the plasmid , as well as noticeable differences in stacking energy and position preference, as expected for a transposon.

virulence genes
secretion systems
the most notable aspect of the other large plasmid, pasa <dig>  is the presence of genes for a type iii secretion system   that has been shown to be required for virulence in a. salmonicida  <cit> . the  <dig> genes encoding the t3ss needle apparatus and regulatory proteins are organized identically to those described previously for the partial sequence of a. salmonicida  <cit>  and the complete t3ss sequences of a. hydrophila: ah- <dig>  <cit> , ah- <dig>  <cit> and ssu  <cit> . as well, three presumptive effector proteins  and their associated chaperones  are located on pasa <dig> . two of the effector proteins aoph and aopo  show significant similarity to yersinia yoph and yopo, and thus are expected to encode a protein tyrosine phosphatase and a protein serine/threonine kinase, respectively  <cit> . a third effector, ati <dig> , was identified by the presence of its chaperone )  <cit>  and its similarity to hypothetical proteins in the t3ss operons of photorhabdus luminescens and vibrio parahaemolyticus. on the basis of conserved domain structure, this effector appears to have inositol polyphosphate phosphatase activity. a fourth, well-characterized effector, aext   <cit> , is encoded on the chromosome. two pseudogenes also appear to encode t3ss effectors: asa_ <dig> is located on the chromosome and is disrupted by an in-frame taa stop codon; asa_p5g <dig> is located on pasa <dig> and is disrupted by a  <dig> bp duplication that results in a frameshift. genes encoding presumptive t3ss chaperones are adjacent to both pseudogenes. the a <dig> genome does not include the aopp effector found in several a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida strains including jf2267and atcc 33658t  <cit> .

3np – not present in a. hydrophila genome

genes for a type vi secretion system , which is also involved in the transfer of bacterial proteins into host cells, are encoded on the a <dig> chromosome  . these  <dig> proteins show high similarity to t6ss proteins from a. hydrophila, p. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria. three additional genes usually associated with this operon are encoded on pasa <dig> . however, a key t6ss gene is interrupted in a449: the gene encoding icmf  contains a  <dig> bp deletion and is fused to the upstream coding sequence in the operon. in addition, two proteins transported by the t6ss are disrupted: a partial vgrg homolog is fused to a transposon subunit , although a complete vgrg gene is encoded on pasa <dig> , and hcp, which is encoded on pasa <dig> , is interrupted by an insertion sequence into which the tn <dig> element has inserted. these gene disruptions are in contrast to a. hydrophila where the t6ss genes are uninterrupted and a functional t6ss has been demonstrated  <cit> . since deletion of the a. hydrophila icmf homolog  blocks t6ss secretion  <cit> , the a <dig> t6ss is unlikely to be functional. the presence of defects in two t3ss effectors and the t6ss suggests that a <dig> could be considerably more virulent, since functional versions of these genes would provide additional means to manipulate the response of the host.

a notable aspect of the t3ss and t6ss is the location of genes for these systems on both the chromosome and the large plasmids. for the t3ss, most of the genes are encoded on pasa <dig>  although one functional effector gene, aext, and a putative effector pseudogene , as well as their t3ss chaperone protein genes , are encoded on the chromosome. in a. hydrophila atcc 7966t, t3ss genes are absent, while other a. hydrophila strains carry t3ss operons on the chromosome  <cit> . the ancestral state of the t3ss in the genus aeromonas is thus unclear, making it difficult to surmise how it ended up in two locations in a <dig>  the t6ss situation is somewhat reversed, with the majority of genes located on the chromosome, but with three genes located on pasa <dig>  since a. hydrophila has a complete, intact t6ss on the chromosome, one might infer that these genes were transferred to pasa <dig> following the acquisition of that plasmid, but prior to the capture of the tn <dig> element.

adhesins
genes for several types of adhesins , which are important in host cell attachment and entry, are present in the a <dig> genome . the abundant surface layer protein vapa   <cit> , which has been implicated as an important virulence factor in several studies  <cit> , is located downstream from an operon for a vapa-specific type ii secretion system . the identification of these genes as a vapa secretion system is based the observation that disruption of spse  blocks vapa secretion  <cit>  and that many of the genes in this operon show some similarity to genes of the general secretion pathway . in the same region of the genome are multiple carbohydrate synthesis and modification genes  that appear to be involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide, which anchors the surface layer to the cell. the genes involved in vapa synthesis and secretion have an unusually low g+c content that can be seen in fig.  <dig> at approximately base  <dig> .

complete sets of genes for two types of flagella, lateral and polar, are also encoded in the a <dig> genome. the genes for lateral flagella are found in a single cluster  but include two disrupted genes: lafa, encoding the lateral flagellin, which has been shown previously to be interrupted by an insertion sequence  <cit> , and lfgd, encoding the lateral flagellar hook-capping protein, which has a  <dig> bp deletion. the genes for the polar flagella are dispersed around the genome in multiple operons , but also include interrupted genes: flgl , encoding a flagellar hook-associated protein, has a  <dig> bp duplication; flra , encoding a transcriptional activator, contains a  <dig> bp deletion; and, maf <dig> , encoding a motility accessory factor  <cit>  has a  <dig> bp deletion. the disruption of genes involved in the production of both types of flagella suggests that neither structure can be synthesized, which is consistent with the characterization of a. salmonicida as non-motile.

an additional class of adhesins, the pili, is well-represented in the a <dig> genome with genes for four different pili  distributed throughout the genome. the type i pilus operon  appears to be complete and intact. however, for each of three types of type iv pili  <cit> , there are frameshifted genes encoding proteins involved in pilin assembly  or a multiple gene deletion  . nevertheless, a mutant deleted for tapa showed reduced virulence when delivered by immersion, but not by intraperitoneal injection, suggesting a role for the tap pilus in host invasion  <cit> .

toxins
another class of putative virulence factors are pore-forming toxins that create channels in host membranes resulting in cell lysis . aerolysin, one of the earliest virulence factors to be discovered among aeromonas spp.  <cit> , is represented by two genes in the a <dig> genome: asa_ <dig>  which encodes the classical aerolysin  <cit> , and asa_ <dig>  which encodes a conserved hemolysin found in other aeromonas species, vibrio species and listonella anguillarum. a large  gene, asx , encodes an rtx  protein, homologs of which are important virulence determinants in a range of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the a <dig> genome also encodes a cytolytic delta-endotoxin  that is 61% similar to the bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal toxin cryet <dig> , which may be an indication of interaction with invertebrates. two additional genes  encode proteins that are  <dig> and 44% similar to the zonula occludens toxin  of colwellia psychrerythraea . zot was first described in vibrio cholerae as a toxin that transiently loosens intracellular tight junctions in the intestinal mucosa  <cit> . in v. cholerae, zot is associated with cholera toxin a and b and is also encoded on the ctxΦ plasmid  <cit> . in a <dig>  however, both genes are interrupted, either by an is  or by a single bp insertion , suggesting that functional proteins can not be synthesized from them.

secreted enzymes
an additional class of potential virulence factors in a. salmonicida are extracellular enzymes, some of which have been previously investigated . among secreted proteases are a serine protease previously tested for its contribution to virulence   <cit> , a zinc metalloprotease  implicated in complement inhibition  <cit> , another secreted metalloprotease  and a microbial collagenase . a gene encoding an extracellular endopeptidase  contributing to virulence in atypical a. salmonicida strains  <cit>  is present, but interrupted by a single bp insertion. the phospholipases encoded by sata , pla  and plc  have been investigated for their role in virulence in a. salmonicida  <cit>  and a. hydrophila  <cit> . extracellular nucleases , amylases , pullulanase  and chitinases  may also contribute to a <dig> virulence. all of these enzymes have a predicted sec-dependent signal sequence and are expected to be secreted via the type ii secretion system   <cit> .

antibiotic resistance
in addition to the antibiotic resistance genes encoded in the tn <dig> element, pasa <dig> also carries genes for tetracycline resistance: teta  encodes a class e tetracycline efflux pump that is presumably regulated by the adjacent class e tetracycline repressor protein , asa_p4g005). three β-lactamase genes, ampc , amps  and cpha , previously described in a. sobria   <cit>  are carried on the a <dig> chromosome . the presence of more than  <dig> genes for multidrug resistance and major facilitator efflux family proteins indicates that a <dig> carries an array of genes to counteract antimicrobials.

iron acquisition
iron acquisition is an important virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens and for a. salmonicida, it may also be a key process for survival in aquatic environments. mesophilic aeromonas species have been found to produce two types of catecholate siderophores, amonabactin and enterobactin  <cit> . when a <dig> is grown under low iron conditions, either in vivo or in the presence of  <dig> '-dipyridyl, three outer membrane proteins are induced that appear to be ferric siderophore or heme receptors  <cit> . on the a <dig> chromosome, both of the ferric siderophore receptors are located adjacent to clusters of genes encoding abc-type ferric transporter subunits as well as non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules, suggesting complete systems for siderophore synthesis and uptake. the gene for the fstc receptor is located within a cluster  that includes the amonabactin synthesis gene  <cit> , indicating that these genes are likely involved in the synthesis and uptake of amonabactin. the gene for the fstb receptor is encoded in a gene cluster  that is similar to the listonella anguillarum anguibactin and the acinetobacter baumannii acinetobactin synthesis genes  <cit> , suggesting that a <dig> has the ability to synthesize and recapture an anguibactin-like siderophore. some of the genes in this cluster have been recently characterized in a. salmonicida and shown to be required for siderophore synthesis  <cit> . adjacent to this gene cluster are five genes  encoding a hydroxamate-type ferric siderophore receptor and an abc transporter system, indicating that a <dig> may also use a hydroxamate siderophore for iron acquisition. the gene for a presumptive heme receptor, hupa , that is induced by low iron conditions  <cit> , is located near hutzxbcd , which encode proteins involved in heme uptake and utilization  <cit> . genes for several additional ton-b dependent outer membrane receptors that may be involved in heme or hemoprotein transport are also present in the a <dig> genome, but require further characterization to establish their function.

quorum sensing
another bacterial process implicated in virulence is quorum sensing  <cit> . the a <dig> chromosome contains the luxi and luxr homologs, asai  and asar , which encode proteins for the synthesis of the acylhomoserine lactone quorum sensing molecule and the transcriptional regulator that responds to it, respectively  <cit> . in addition, genes for a second quorum sensing pathway that uses autoinducer- <dig>  <cit>  are present: luxs  encodes the autoinducer- <dig> synthase, luxu  is a putative phosphorelay protein involved in transduction of the signal and luxo  is a transcriptional response regulator . other unidentified genes in the a <dig> genome may also participate in these systems since in vibrio spp. receptor proteins and multiple small rnas are involved in the complete signal transduction pathway  <cit> .

comparison to the a. hydrophila genome
the genome sequence of a. hydrophila atcc 7966t  <cit>  provides an excellent basis for comparative sequence analysis leading to enhanced understanding of genome evolution within the genus aeromonas. a comparative analysis of the two chromosomes using mummer  <cit>  is shown in fig.  <dig>  due to an inversion around the origin of replication, the a <dig> sequence primarily aligns with the a. hydrophila sequence on the reverse strand . as expected for two chromosomes of nearly the same size, there are no large gap regions indicative of significant insertions or deletions. nearly all regions of sequence similarity fall along one of the diagonals, indicating generally similar gene and sequence order. approximately  <dig> large sequence inversions  around the origin of replication have occurred in the a <dig> chromosome relative to the a. hydrophila chromosome, accounting for the regions of forward strand alignment. the large inversion already noted in the a <dig> chromosome, which appears to be an evolutionarily recent change since it is bounded by transposons and is absent in a. hydrophila, stands out as a red line along the blue  diagonal at  <dig>  bp in the a. hydrophila sequence.

on a global scale, the a <dig> and a. hydrophila chromosomes appear generally similar and encode similar numbers of proteins . however, there are multiple instances of single gene or operon loss and gain between the two genomes, leading to a 9% difference in gene content. there are  <dig> coding sequences  present in the a. salmonicida chromosome that are not found on the a. hydrophila chromosome. many of these are transposon  or phage related  and  <dig> represent cds unique to a. salmonicida. however, there are also  <dig> conserved hypothetical cds found in other bacterial species and  <dig> known cds that are present in the a. salmonicida genome, but not in that of a. hydrophila. conversely, the a. hydrophila genome contains  <dig> cds not present in a. salmonicida . clearly, significant changes in gene content have occurred following the separation of these two species.

pseudogenes
an additional obvious difference between the a. salmonicida and a. hydrophila genomes is the number of pseudogenes present. the a. hydrophila genome  <cit>  has only  <dig> pseudogenes:  <dig> in trna genes,  <dig> protein cds with in-frame stop codons and  <dig> frameshifted protein cds. only one of these cds  is present in a. salmonicida  and both genes contain the same frameshift. to investigate the frequency and occurrence of frameshifts in the genus aeromonas, we attempted to amplify and sequence  <dig> a. salmonicida pseudogenes  having a variety of lesions from five a. salmonicida strains  and from one strain each of five other aeromonas species  . in addition, these sequences were amplified from a <dig> cdna to determine whether transcriptional frameshifting corrected any of them. all the cdna sequences were identical to the genomic sequence . while most of the genes could be amplified from the a. salmonicida strains and subspecies, the amplification of genes from the other aeromonas species was considerably less successful , presumably due to sequence changes at the primer sites. however, it is clear  that in the single species of a. salmonicida subsp. masoucida, achromogenes and smithia that were tested, only  <dig> or  <dig> of the pseudogenes are present and that none of the amplified sequences from the other aeromonas species showed disruptions. while this analysis tests less than 10% of the a <dig> pseudogenes and although the data are incomplete for many of the non-a. salmonicida species, these pseudogenes appear to be limited to a. salmonicida with the majority present only in a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida.

 <dig> the genes tested are described additional file  <dig>  primers used for amplification are described in additional file  <dig> 

2sequences used were from the complete genomes.

genomic evidence for pathogen speciation
analyses of the genomes of bacterial pathogens provide evidence that three key processes, the acquisition of mobile genetic elements, genome rearrangements and gene loss in the process of adapting to a specific host, result in substantial changes in the genomes of pathogens . since its separation from the last common ancestor with a. hydrophila, a <dig> appears to have acquired multiple plasmids, two prophages, a variety of is elements and a number of individual genes and operons, presumably through horizontal gene transfer. while mechanisms for the acquisition of prophage, plasmids and insertion sequences are understood, mechanisms for the gain of individual genes, such as the b. thuringiensis toxin, or operons, such as vapa and its secretion system, are less obvious. the acquisition of foreign dna appears to be an ongoing process in a. salmonicida based on the diversity of plasmids identified in various strains  <cit> . is transposition also continues to be active in a <dig> since mutants can be generated by is transposition , usually by growth under stressful conditions such as elevated temperature .

substantial genetic rearrangements have occurred in the a <dig> genome, relative to the a. hydrophila genome. many of these rearrangements have been assisted by the presence of is elements, such as the apparent transfer of t6ss genes to pasa <dig> and the large inversion. most of the other inversions, relative to a. hydrophila, do not appear to be associated with is elements, indicating that other mechanisms are also generating genetic rearrangements. while these large scale rearrangements do not obviously affect gene sequences, reorientation of large regions relative to the origin of replication may impact the regulation of gene expression.

the third trait of recently evolved pathogen genomes, gene loss or decay, has also occurred frequently in the a <dig> genome. the number of a <dig> pseudogenes,  <dig>  is comparable to that seen in yersinia pestis   <cit> , but less than other recently evolved human pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct <dig>   <cit>  or mycobacterium leprae   <cit> . several of the a <dig> pseudogenes prevent the expression of cell surface structures such as flagella and pili. loss of flagellar motility is common among recently emerged pathogens  <cit> , perhaps as a means to evade the host innate immune system. loss of genes for type iv pili is also associated with pathogen speciation  <cit>  and may also help pathogens avoid innate immune responses  <cit> . significant accumulations of pseudogenes are also found among genes for transcriptional regulators , genes encoding carbohydrate synthesis and modification enzymes  and genes for basic metabolic enzymes  . compared to a. hydrophila atcc 7966t, the "jack of all trades"  <cit> , the accumulation of pseudogenes in a <dig> has considerably reduced its capacity to produce some organelles  and to synthesize some enzymes and their products.

the a <dig> genome thus carries all the hallmarks of an organism that has undergone adaptation to a specific host. clearly, substantial horizontal gene transfer, genome rearrangements and gene decay have occurred in a <dig> relative to a. hydrophila atcc 7966t. the small survey of pseudogenes in other members of the genus aeromonas suggests that pseudogene accumulation coincided with the speciation of a. salmonicida but increased substantially during the evolution of the subspecies salmonicida. further analysis of aeromonas sequences and genomes should provide insights into the process and timing of the evolution of host specialization as well as a better understanding of the genes and proteins involved in virulence.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida a <dig> consists of a circular chromosome and five plasmids that encode more than  <dig> genes. a large number of genes encoding potential virulence factors have been identified, although a number of them have been disrupted to become pseudogenes. the acquisition of plasmids, insertion sequences and pseudogenes, along with large genome rearrangements is indicative of a genome that has decayed to adapt to the environment of a specific host.
