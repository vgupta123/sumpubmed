BACKGROUND
molecules are transported into or out of the nucleus in two different ways, passive diffusion and active transport. smaller molecules  diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex . macromolecules, such as cargo proteins, require some soluble nucleic or cytosolic factors for active transport  <cit> . this nucleocytoplasmic transport not only locate proteins in the cytoplasm or nucleus through export ribosomes, mrnas and trnas to the cytoplasm, or import nuclear proteins from the cytoplasm <cit> , but also functions as a key step in signal transduction pathways and in the regulation of cell cycle progression  <cit> . the export of mrna is not dependent of members of the conventional nuclear export family, exportins and the ran gtpase  <cit> . nuclear transport factor  <dig>  and ran were originally identified as soluble cytosolic factors necessary for the efficient protein transport in permeabilized mammalian cells  <cit> . ntf <dig> interacts with the cytosolic factor ran to perform a function in the nuclear transport  <cit> . in mammalian cells, ntf <dig> was initially identified as stimulating the import of proteins into the nucleus  <cit> , particularly resulting in the accumulation of ran in the nucleus  <cit> .

ran belongs to the small ras gtpase superfamily and switches between the gdp-bound  and gtp-bound  states for its activity  <cit> . rangdp combines with ntf <dig> and is transported into the nucleus. the ran nucleotide exchange factor  converts rangdp into rangtp in the nucleus  <cit> . rangtp is required to release the imported cargo proteins from the importin proteins  by competitive binding to importin β in the nucleus  <cit> . rangtp is then transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm by importinβ and is converted to rangdp by rangap, a cytoplasmic gtpase-activating protein  <cit> . this cause ran to act as a major regulator of nucleocytoplasmic transport and to regulate the interaction between proteins.

the ntf <dig> protein binds specifically to the ran-gdp form  <cit>  and then is transported into the nucleus  <cit> . a mutant ntf <dig> that cannot bind ran is unable to facilitate ran import into the nucleus  <cit> . ntf <dig> is an essential protein in yeast and caenorhabditis elegans and nuclear protein import was destroyed by its effective negative mutants. for example, the conditional alleles of yeast ntf- <dig> show defects in nuclear protein import  <cit> . also, loss of ntf <dig> using antibodies prevents the nuclear import of proteins in hela cells  <cit> . in drosophila, mutants of ntf <dig> affect the import of rel proteins to nuclear in the immune response and show a specific eye phenotype  <cit> . the overexpression of ntf <dig> disturbs the nuclear import in a ran-binding-dependent manner in arabidopsis  <cit> . interaction between ntf <dig> and ran is necessary for the nuclear import of the filamentous actin capping protein, capg  <cit> .

in holometabolous insects, the life cycle is characterized by a series of moltings, including larval molting  and metamorphic molting , which are regulated by ecdysteroids  and the juvenile hormone . ecdysteroids orchestrate the molting process and jh determines the nature of the molt  <cit> . jh is normally present during the larval stages to enable growth and progression from one larval stage to the next until the larva reaches the appropriate size for metamorphosis  <cit> . metamorphosis is regulated by changes in the titer of the steroid hormone 20e when the amount of jh decreases. a pulse of 20e at the end of the last larval stage triggers the onset of prepupal development  <cit> . 20e regulates the expression of some early response genes, such as the transcripition factors broad-complex , e <dig> and e <dig>  <cit>  through the 20e receptors, the heterodimer nuclear hormone receptors of the ecdysone receptor  and the ultraspiracle   <cit> . these transcription factors then induce the expression of other late genes  <cit> . during the 20e signal transduction, proteins are frequently imported into or exported from nucleus. to date, however, little is known about the roles of ntf <dig> and ran in the proteins transporting involved in the 20e signal transduction pathway during insect molting or metamorphosis.

in previous work, we used the suppression subtractive hybridization  technique and detected an increased expression of ntf <dig> during metamorphosis in h.armigera <cit> . to demonstrate the role of ntf <dig> in the 20e signal transduction pathway, we therefore cloned this gene and named it ha-ntf <dig>  since ran is a cofactor of ntf <dig>  we also cloned ran from h. armigera and named it ha-ran. we further investigated the expression patterns of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in developmental stages and demonstrated the interaction of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in vitro and in vivo. meanwhile, we studied the 20e regulation of these two genes. furthermore, using rnai technique in the h. armigera epidermis  cell line, we found that after interfering ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran, the expression of other genes, such as ecdysone receptor b <dig> , ultraspiracle protein  <dig> , ecdysone induced protein e75b , broad-complex z <dig> , and hormone receptor  <dig>  decreased. the distribution of ha-ran was prevented in the cytoplasm when ha-ntf <dig> was knocked down in the haepi cell, and the nuclear location of the ecr-b <dig> was also blocked after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran. these evidences suggested that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran participated in the 20e signal transduction pathway by regulating the location of ecr-b <dig> 

RESULTS
cdna cloning and sequence analysis of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran
the full-length of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran cdna were cloned using the strategies described in materials and methods section. the full length of ha-ntf <dig> was  <dig> bp, including a  <dig> bp 5' untranslated region , a  <dig> bp orf and a  <dig> bp 3' utr. the orf encoded a 131- amino acid protein with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and a predicted theoretical isoelectric point  of  <dig> . the predicted protein had no signal peptide and 10- <dig> amino acids  were predicted to comprise a ntf <dig> domain. it included two predicted casein kinase ii phosphorylation sites  .

the complete cdna of ha-ran included a  <dig> bp orf, a  <dig> bp upstream sequence of orf and a  <dig> bp downstream sequence. the cdna encoded a  <dig>  kda protein with a pi of  <dig> . 62- <dig> aa were predicted to be the gtp-binding nuclear protein ran signature. the protein included six presumed protein kinase c phosphorylation sites, such as aa 7- <dig>  18- <dig>  51- <dig>  90- <dig>  94- <dig> and 147- <dig>  14- <dig> aa were predicted to constitute one atp/gtp-binding site motif a  .

database searches using the blastx program revealed that ha-ntf <dig> has  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 68% identity to apis mellifera ntf <dig>  aedes aegypti ntf <dig>  maconellicoccus hirsutus ntf <dig>  and drosophila melanogaster ntf <dig>  respectively . the sequence identity of ha-ran with other known insects such as bombyx mori, a. mellifera, a. aegypti and d. melanogaster is  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 91%, respectively . the alignment of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran sequences from other insects indicated that they are both highly conserved among different insects .

recombinant expression of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran
the ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran proteins were expressed as soluble protein in e. coli bl <dig>  cells with pet30a -ha-ntf <dig> or pet30a -ha-ran as the expression vector. the target recombinant proteins his-rha-ntf <dig> and his-rha-ran were then purified to homogeneity using a ni2+-nta affinity column. the apparent molecular mass of the purified his-rha-ntf <dig> protein was about  <dig> kda, consistent with what we expected. the predicted molecular mass of the ha-ntf <dig> protein was  <dig>  kda, plus about  <dig> kda from the additional amino acids in the n-terminal of the expressed fusion protein on the vector . the apparent molecular mass of the purified his-rha-ran protein was  <dig> kda, this was higher than the theoretical weight of  <dig> kda  . this was because of the tag from the vector; when we hydrolyzed the purified his-rha-ran protein using thrombin, the molecular mass of rha-ran was  <dig> kda . the polyclonal antibodies against ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran were tested by immunoblotting using the proteins from 5- <dig> h fat bodies and results showed the polyclonal antibodies were specific .

expression profiles of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran during developmental stages
the expression profiles of ha-ntf <dig> throughout developmental stages were further analyzed in the head-thorax, integument, midgut and fat body from 5th- <dig> h to pupae  <dig> d using northern blot analysis. results showed that the expression of ha-ntf <dig> transcription in the head-thorax was consistent from 5th- <dig> h feeding larvae to 6th- <dig> h  larvae except 6th- <dig> h , but it was obviously upregulated from 6th- <dig> h  larvae to p <dig> d  pupae. the expression of ha-ntf <dig> in the integument was similar to that in the head-thorax. however, the transcription of ha-ntf <dig> in the midgut was not regular; it was higher from 5th- <dig> h feeding stage to head capsule slippage  molting stage. it then decreased after the larvae entered the 6th instar, and it was upregulated slightly in the wandering stage , and then downregulated when the larvae entered the pupal stage, although the protein translation seemed regular, it was upregulated in the wandering stage. in the fat bodies, ha-ntf <dig> transcription did not differ much during various developmental stages . in contrast to the expression of ha-ntf <dig>  immunoblotting analyses indicated the expression profiles of ha-ran in the four tissues had relatively even expression levels at various developmental stages compared with ha-ntf <dig>  except for some increases in head-thorax during larval molting  .

location of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in the tissues
we took integument and fat body samples from 5th- <dig> h larvae to localize ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran in the tissues. the ha-ntf <dig> signal was detected in the epidermis and fat body; the nuclei in the fat body released an intensive signal . the results showed that ha-ran was also predominantly located in the nucleus, especially in the fat body .

interaction of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in vitro or in vivo
to examine the interaction of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in vitro, we performed direct binding assay in vitro. in the binding assay, after the his-rha-ran affiliated ni2+-nta column that was bonded by rha-ntf <dig> was washed to clear, both rha-ntf <dig> and his-rha-ran were detected in the eluted proteins from the column . similarly, both rha-ran and his-rha-ntf <dig> were detected from the his-rha-ntf <dig> affiliated ni2+-nta column that was bounded by rha-ran , although his-rha-ntf <dig> was partially degraded. these results suggested that rha-ran and rha-ntf <dig> could bind with each other in vitro.

to examine the interaction of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in vivo, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay. results showed that ha-ntf <dig> was detected in the precipitate produced by anti-ha-ran . similarly, ha-ran was detected in the precipitate produced by anti-ha-ntf <dig> . these experiments suggested that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran bond together in vivo.

regulation of the ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran by 20e
the cdna synthesized by total rna, which was isolated from the larvae after injection of 20e, was used for analysis. semi-quantitative rt-pcr results suggested that ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran were distinctly upregulated from  <dig> to  <dig> h after the injection of 20e. this is compared to the expression in the normal 6th- <dig> h larvae and the larvae injected with dmso. the expression of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran started to decline from the  <dig> h .

function of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in the 20e signal pathway
to examine the function of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran in the 20e signal pathway, we examined the mrna levels of genes involved in the 20e signal pathway using rt-pcr. compared to the control cells without 20e, the expression of genes, including ha-ntf <dig>  ha-ran, ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-cz <dig>  hhr <dig>  ha-eif5c and survivin, were all upregulated after induction by 20e. the expression of ha-ntf <dig> was obviously knocked down after adding dsntf <dig>  the expression of other genes, including ha-ran, ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-cz <dig>  hhr <dig> and ha-eif5c, also decreased when compared to their mrna levels in the cells with dsgfp . similarly, the knockdown of ha-ran also resulted in its downregulation and the downregulation of other genes, including ha-ntf <dig>  ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-cz <dig>  hhr <dig> and ha-eif5c. the expression of survivin was not affected after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran .

to demonstrate the mechanism of the above results, we further examined the variation of subcellular localization of ha-ran, ecr-b <dig> and usp <dig>  results showed that ha-ran protein was mainly located in the nucleus of normal cells  or the cells with dsgfp added , whereas its signal was increased in the cytoplasm after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> .

similar to the variation of ha-ran in the cytoplasm and nucleus, ecr-b <dig> was mainly located in the nuclei of normal cells, normal cells with 20e or cells with dsgfp and 20e . however, the ecr-b <dig> signal was increased in the cytoplasm after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran, but not after injection of dsgfp . however, the distribution of usp <dig> was primarily located in the nucleus and there were no obvious changes after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran .

discussion
in this study, we cloned the cdna of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran from the cotton bollworm, h. armigera. homology analysis revealed that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran were conserved among different insect species. the expression profiles in different tissues at various developmental stages and ecdysone hormone injection experiments suggested that ha-ntf <dig> was regulated by 20e. however, ha-ran was likely a housekeeping gene but could be regulated by 20e in vitro. ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran could combine together in vitro and in vivo. the nuclear location of ha-ran was prevented after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig>  which in turn blocked the nuclear transport of ecr-b <dig> in the cells. both of ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran are needed in the 20e signal transduction pathway through participating in the nuclear transport of ecr-b <dig> in the cells.

our studies have shown that ha-ntf <dig> is expressed in the head-thorax, integument, midgut and fat body, but their expression profiles in these tissues at the various developmental stages were different. the expressions of ha-ntf <dig> in the head-thorax and the integument were obviously upregulated in the metamorphically committed larvae. the head-thorax contain major integument, in addition, they also contain the brain, prothoracic gland, foregut, fat body, and other organs. since the expression pattern was similar to the integument, the mrna detected in the head-thorax might major from integument in this part. from the 6th- <dig> h, the larvae stopped eating and entered the wandering stage. then, the larvae morphologically and physiologically transformed into pupa . the up-regulation of ha-ntf <dig> that occurred during the prepupal period was likely due to the increased ecdysteroid necessary for pupation. similarly, in the midgut, the increased expression of ha-ntf <dig> in the 5th instar larvae and metamorphic larvae might have the function in protein transport.

different from ha-ntf <dig>  ha-ran did not show obvious variation in the different tissues during larval development, this suggests that ha-ran is likely a housekeeping gene and its function in transporting proteins into the nucleus might be regulated by its conversion between rangtp and rangdp. the constitutive expression pattern suggests that ran not only plays a key role in nuclear import, but also has been implicated in a wide variety of intranuclear events, such as centrosome duplication, microtubule dynamics, chromosome alignment, kinetochore attachment of microtubules, rna transcription and processing, and rna export. this would explain its abundance and why it is accumulated inside the nucleus  <cit> . the results from tissues and the haepi cell line also demonstrated that ha-ran protein was located primarily inside the nucleus. our results showed that after knocking down of ha-ntf <dig>  the ha-ran protein was prevented in the cytoplasm. this result is similar to that in the ntf <dig> mutant, the ran protein couldn't be imported into the nucleus  <cit> . immunohistochemical results showed that the ha-ntf <dig> was distributed predominantly in the nucleus. there was some distribution in the cytoplasm which was related to its migration between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. this phenomenon is different from the report that ntf <dig> protein concentrated at the nuclear envelope  <cit> .

h. armigera has similar development patterns to other lepidopteran insects  <cit> . the developmental expression patterns of ha-ntf <dig> are correlated to the 20e puff during molting and metamorphosis  <cit> , suggesting that ha-ntf <dig> was upregulated by 20e in vivo. our experiments in vitro indeed confirmed that ha-ntf <dig> was upregulated by 20e. this was also proved in the haepi cell line by shao et al .

the interaction between ran and ntf <dig> was previously proved using sepharose bead binding assay and pull down assays  <cit> . we also proved here that ha-ran and ha-ntf <dig> could bind with each other in vitro and in vivo. this evidence indicated that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran performed roles by interacting with each other. rnai experiments suggested that interfering with any one of them resulted in a loss of the protein transport functions and the later events in signal transduction pathways. ecrb, usp <dig>  e75b, broad-complex and hhr <dig> are molting-related transcriptional factors and are upregulated by 20e  <cit> . ha-eif5c, ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran are late genes in the 20e signal transduction pathway because they have been proved to be upregulated by 20e  <cit> . when the gene ha-ntf <dig> was suppressed, not only the expression of ha-ran decreased, but also the expressions of other genes involved in the 20e signal transduction pathway were affected, such as ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-c z <dig>  hhr <dig> and ha-eif5c. similarly, when the gene ha-ran was suppressed, the expression of ha-ntf <dig>  ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig>  e75b, br-c z <dig>  hhr <dig> and ha-eif5c were also affected. only survivin, an apoptosis inhibitor gene, was not affected by the knockdown of both ha-ran and ha-ntf <dig>  these results suggested that both ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran are necessary for the transcription of these genes. the gene transcription needs the participation of transcription factors such as ecr-b <dig>  usp <dig> and e75b, which were initiated by 20e in the signal transduction pathway, to transport into the nucleus. the evidence that the expression of 20e regulated genes decreased after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran suggested that ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran are involved in the 20e signal transduction pathway.

the heterodimerization between ecr and usp is required for ligand and dna binding and gene transcription  <cit> . ecr and usp can enter the nucleus separately and are mainly located in the nucleus  <cit> . the transport of ecr and usp of d. melanogaster from nucleus to cytoplasm was found in mammalian cells, which is a process that requires energy supplied by atpase, not gtpase  <cit> . the gradient of rangtp between nucleus and cytoplasm is critical for the directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport of many cargos proteins by nuclear transport receptors  <cit> . the binding of rangtp to importins not only dissociates nuclear import complexes, which lead to the nuclear accumulation of the cargo proteins containing nuclear localization signal , but also is required for the interaction of exportins with crago proteins which containing nuclear export signal   <cit> . the three known ecr isoforms  all have two ness in ligand binding domain and one nls activity within the dna-binding domain, and exhibit nucleocytoplasmic shuttling  <cit> . the location of ecr exhibits circadian rhythms, a daily rhythm in the nuclear abundance and subcelluar location in the epidermal cells of rhodnius prolixus <cit> , which suggested that ecr plays its roles by travelling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. ecr-b <dig>  is found to interact with importin α <dig> and exportin  <dig>  <cit> . importin α <dig> and exportin  <dig> participate in the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of proteins in mammalian cells  <cit> . our results indicated that the nuclear location of ha-ran was prevented after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig>  in addition, the nuclear location of the 20e receptor ecr-b <dig> was also prevented after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran. figure  <dig> showed that how the ntf <dig> and ran function in the import of the ecr-b <dig> in the 20e signal transduction pathway. the nucleocytoplasmic transport by impotinα and β referenced the schematic view reported by isgro and schulten  <cit> . after knock down of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran, the energy gradient of rangtp between nucleus and cytoplasm was destroyed, therefore, the nuclear translocation of ecr-b <dig> was prevented, and thereby the 20e signal transduction pathway was blocked. however, the location of usp <dig> was not affected after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran.

CONCLUSIONS
ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran were primarily localized in the nucleus of various tissues and could interact with each other in vitro or in vivo. however, it was interesting to find that both of them could be upregulated by 20e. the nuclear location of ha-ran was prevented after the knockdown of ha-ntf <dig>  the results that knocking down of ha-ntf <dig> or ha-ran resulting in the decrease of 20e regulated genes suggested that the transporting of the transcription factor ecr-b <dig> into the nucleus was prevented, so that the 20e signal transduction pathway was blocked. therefore, ha-ntf <dig> and ha-ran participated in 20e signal transduction pathway by regulating the nuclear location of ecr-b <dig>
