BACKGROUND
human wwox/fra16d gene encodes a candidate tumor suppressor ww domain-containing oxidoreductase, designated wwox, for, or wox <dig>  <cit> . this gene is located on a common fragile site ch16q <dig> – <dig>   <cit> . loss of heterozygosity  of wwox gene has been found in several types of cancers . wwox/for/wox <dig> possesses two n-terminal ww domains , a nuclear localization sequence  between the ww domains, and a c-terminal short chain alcohol dehydrogenase/reductase  domain. wwox mrna may undergo alternative splicing, thereby generating at least  <dig> mrnas mainly coding for proteins with altered sdr domain sequences  <cit> . several protein isoforms have been identified  <cit> . nonetheless, presence of specific protein isoforms in normal and cancerous tissues remains to be established.

wwox/for/wox <dig> is considered as a candidate tumor suppressor and proapoptotic protein, whereas its in vivo function is largely unknown  <cit> . under stress conditions, wox <dig> undergoes phosphorylation at tyr <dig> and may translocate to the mitochondria and nuclei to induce apoptosis in cultured cells and in rat eyes  <cit> . tyr33-phosphorylated or activated wox <dig> binds to the proline-rich region and phospho-ser <dig> of p <dig>  and both proteins induce apoptosis synergistically  <cit> . when wox <dig> is functionally suppressed by antisense mrna, small interfering rna , or dominant negatives, the stability of p <dig> and its apoptotic function are significantly suppressed  <cit> . the proapoptotic function of wox <dig> is probably associated, in part, with its interaction with p <dig>  p <dig>  jnk <dig> and other transcription factors  <cit> .

to isolate wox1-binding proteins using yeast two-hybrid cdna library screening  <cit> , we found that wox <dig> interacts with a small size 31-amino-acid protein, zfra   <cit> . zfra belongs to the family of c2h <dig> type zinc finger proteins  <cit> , and has a sequence homology to transcription factor forkhead protein xfkhr <dig>  <cit> . zinc finger proteins interact with dna and rna, which is essential for regulating gene transcription during cell growth and embryogenesis. damage to the zinc fingers in dna repair proteins may induce carcinogenesis  <cit> . zfra mrna is expressed in many organs and tissues and most abundant in the spleen  <cit> . however, it is absent in several prostate and breast cancer cell lines  <cit> .

zfra participates in the signal pathway of tumor necrosis factor  . zfra appears to play a dual role in regulating the cytotoxic effects of tnf and fas ligand   <cit> . zfra either enhances or blocks the apoptotic functions of transiently overexpressed receptor adaptor proteins tradd  and fadd   <cit> . tradd and fadd are recruited to the tnf receptors when cells are stimulated with tnf or fas ligand . in response to tnf and uv light, zfra undergoes self-binding and interacts with jnk <dig>  <cit> . jnk <dig> is a downstream effector of the tnf signaling  <cit> . the functional mechanism for the action of zfra remains to be established.

in this study, we further investigated the underlying mechanisms for the regulatory effect of zfra on cell death caused by transiently overexpressed death domain proteins, including tradd, fadd and rip . we determined the role of a conserved phosphorylation site at serine  <dig> in conferring zfra-induced apoptosis. also, we examined whether zfra regulates the activation of transcription factor nf-κb and tumor suppressors p <dig> and wox <dig> in response to tnf and uv light, and discussed the biological implications of their interactions both in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
transiently overexpressed zfra induces apoptosis
we have previously shown that when ectopic zfra is stably expressed in l <dig> fibroblasts, these cells resist the cytotoxic effects of tnf and fasl  <cit> . in contrast, depending upon the concentrations used or the extent of expression, transiently expressed zfra could either enhance or inhibit the cytotoxic function of overexpressed death domain proteins tradd and fadd  <cit> . the underlying mechanism of this regard is unknown.

to further examine the role of zfra-mediated death, a panel of adherent cell lines was transfected with an egfp-tagged zfra cdna expression construct by capo <dig>  for non-adherent molt <dig> t cells, the dna construct was introduced by electroporation . in controls, cells were transfected with buffer or egfp vector only. following  <dig> hr in culture, zfra induced death of human cell lines including ovarian me <dig>  embryonic kidney hek- <dig>  neuroblastoma sk-n-sh, molt <dig> t lymphocytes, and breast mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells, and murine l <dig> fibroblasts . however, zfra had no effect on human prostate du <dig> and mink lung epithelial mv1lu cells . based on our previous observations  <cit> , an optimal dose of zfra,  <dig> ng/well in 96-well plates, was used to produce ~30–40% death of l <dig> cells. cells with positive protein expression were approximately 60–75%, as determined by fluorescence microscopy . egfp-zfra was present ubiquitously in cell compartments in majority of the tested cells. interestingly, egfp-zfra was mainly present in the cytoplasm in breast mda-mb- <dig> cells .

cells, including hek- <dig>  sk-n-sh, molt <dig> and l <dig>  express zfra mrna, and they are sensitive to zfra-induced death  <cit> . breast mcf <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cells do not express zfra  <cit> , but were sensitive to zfra-mediated death . prostate du <dig> is a zfra-negative cell line  <cit> , and resisted death by zfra . together, our data show that resistance to zfra-mediated death is not related with the presence or absence of endogenous zfra in cells.

we examined the effect of zfra on anchorage-independent cell growth  <cit> . as expected, zfra blocked colony formation of l <dig> cells on agarose plates, as compared to empty vector controls .

to further determine zfra-mediated apoptosis, molt <dig> t cells were transfected with egfp-zfra and cultured for  <dig> hr. the extent of exposure of phosphatidylserine to cell surface was determined by annexin v assay. zfra increased the exposure of phosphatidylserine on cell surface , indicating that cells have undergone apoptosis.

involvement of conserved serine  <dig>  in zfra-induced apoptosis
ser <dig> is a conserved phosphorylation site in zfra  <cit> . we determined the potential role of this site in conferring the apoptotic function of zfra. by site-directed mutagenesis, ser <dig> was altered to gly . l <dig> cells were electroporated with egfp-zfra, s8g, or egfp, and the cells were cultured for  <dig> hr. again, transiently overexpressed zfra induced death of l <dig> cells , whereas s8g mutant had a significantly reduced activity in causing cell death  . these observations suggest that ser <dig> phosphorylation is essential for zfra-induced apoptosis.

zfra regulates death domain protein-mediated cell death
tradd, fadd and rip are recruited to the tnf receptor during tnf signaling. rip interacts with tradd or fadd  <cit> . we have shown that zfra modulates the apoptotic function of overexpressed tradd and fadd  <cit> . here, we continued to examine whether zfra affects rip-mediated cell death. we used me <dig>  hek- <dig> and du <dig> cells, and du <dig> was resistant to zfra-mediated death . these cells were cotransfected with "cytotoxic" doses of cdna expression constructs of tradd and/or zfra  by capo <dig>  similar experiments were performed with zfra with fadd and rip. both zfra and tradd induced death of me <dig> and hek- <dig> cells in an additive manner . nonetheless, zfra did not increase cell death with fadd or rip in an additive manner . in the zfra-resistant du <dig> cells, zfra alone did not cause cell death, but increased the cytotoxic function of tradd, fadd and rip by approximately 100–150% .

next, we tested the effect on death using non-cytotoxic doses of cdna constructs. under this condition, there was a synergistic enhancement of me <dig> cell death by zfra and tradd, fadd or rip .

indeed, zfra regulates cell growth in a biphasic manner. at low doses, zfra enhanced growth of zfra-sensitive l <dig> cells. but, cell death occurred when higher doses of zfra were used, as measured  <dig> hr post transfection . cytotoxic levels of rip blocked the growth enhancement of zfra. similarly, at low levels rip had no effect on l <dig> cell growth, and when in combination, non-toxic doses of zfra and rip increased the cell death .

taken together from the above experiments, our data clearly show that depending upon concentrations or the extent of expression, zfra may regulate the function of death domain proteins tradd, fadd or rip in a synergistic or an antagonistic manner.

zfra physically interacts with tradd, and binds to the n-terminal first ww domain and c-terminal sdr domain of wox1
we have utilized a novel cytoplasm-based two-hybrid analysis in mapping protein/protein interactions between domains and/or motifs  <cit> . briefly, bait is expressed in the cytoplasm of yeast cells. when the bait physically interacts with a cell membrane-anchored target, mutant yeast cells grow in a selective medium at 37°c as a result of activation of ras signal pathway  <cit> . we showed that zfra interacted with wox <dig> from yeast two-hybrid library screening. to map the zfra-binding domain in wox <dig>  we determined that zfra physically interacted with the n-terminal first ww domain of wox <dig> . alteration of the known phosphorylation site tyr <dig> to arg in this domain abrogated the binding , suggesting that tyr <dig> phosphorylation is needed for wox <dig> to interact with zfra. during activation, wox <dig> undergoes tyr <dig> phosphorylation and nuclear translocation both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . zfra also bound the c-terminal sdr domain. this domain has a mitochondria-targeting region, and zfra did not bind to this region . in a negative control, empty vector versus empty vector was tested. in a positive control, self-binding of mafb is shown  <cit>  .

we also determined that zfra physically interacted with the full-length tradd but not rip, and wox <dig> interacted with tradd . together, these observations suggest that zfra and wox <dig> may complex with tradd, and this complex affects tnf-mediated cell death.

tnf induces the binding of zfra with tyr33-phosphorylated wox <dig>  jnk <dig>  and nf-κb
to verify the above observations, we utilized gst  pull-down analysis and co-immunoprecipitation to characterize the binding of zfra with its partners. zfra was tagged with gst at its n-terminus. recombinant gst-zfra protein was produced in bacteria, and then purified using glutathione-sepharose 4b resin. similarly, recombinant gst alone was produced and purified. exposure of zfra-sensitive sk-n-sh cells to tnf resulted in an increased expression of zfra and degradation of iκbα , indicating that this cell line has a functional tnf signal pathway. this cell line expresses a low level of zfra.

zfra is able to undergo self-association and binds jnk <dig>  <cit> . in gst pull-down assays, gst-zfra was shown to interact with endogenous zfra and wox <dig>  and tnf barely increased the binding in sk-n-sh cells . in addition, tnf increased the binding of gst-zfra with jnk <dig>  nf-κb  and p-wox <dig> , and weakly with p <dig> in a time-related manner . zfra could not interact with iκbα, fadd, rip and fas . similarly, in response to uv light , there was an increased binding of gst-zfra with endogenous zfra, p-wox <dig> and jnk <dig> in sk-n-sh cells, as determined by pull-down analysis . uv light increased the binding of endogenous zfra with phosphorylated jnk <dig>  in sk-n-sh cells, as determined by co-immunoprecipitation .

transiently overexpressed zfra sequesters wox <dig>  nf-κb, p <dig> and p-erk in the cytoplasm
the above data show that endogenous zfra may physically interacts with endogenous wox <dig>  nf-κb and jnk1/ <dig> in non-stimulated cells. we examined whether transiently overexpressed zfra sequesters these proteins in the cytoplasm and prevents their nuclear translocation by stress stimuli. sk-n-sh cells were electroporated with egfp-zfra or egfp only, followed by culturing for  <dig> hr. transiently overexpressed egfp-zfra suppressed nuclear localization of nf-κb , wox <dig>  p <dig>  p-erk , but had little or no effect on jnk1/ <dig> . tnf induced nuclear translocation of nf-κb in egfp control cells, but this event was blocked in the egfp-zfra-expressing cells . similarly, in zfra-negative breast mcf <dig> cells, transiently overexpressed egfp-zfra suppressed nuclear translocation of nf-κb and wox <dig> . interestingly, transiently overexpressed egfp-zfra did not have a significant effect on the nuclear localization of wox <dig> in molt <dig> t cells . however, egfp-zfra blocked uv light-induced wox <dig> nuclear translocation in molt <dig> t cells.

zfra counteracts the apoptotic function of wox1
next, we examined whether zfra counteracts the apoptotic function of wox <dig>  l <dig> cells were transfected with an apoptosis-inducing amount of egfp-wox <dig>  in the presence or absence of low doses of egfp-zfra by capo <dig>  in parallel with the above observations , low doses of zfra enhanced the growth of l <dig> cells during  <dig> and  <dig> hr in culture . zfra counteracted wox1-mediated growth suppression and death of l <dig> cells, as determined using crystal violet staining . similar results were observed by counting the number of apoptotic nuclei . protein expression of egfp-wox <dig> and egfp-zfra were examined by fluorescence microscopy . wox <dig> is shown in a perinuclear area, whereas zfra is expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus.

similarly, l <dig> cells were electroporated with wox <dig> and/or zfra. these cells were cultured for  <dig> hr, and then processed for dna fragmentation in agarose gel electrophoresis. wox1-induced apoptosis was blocked by a non-apoptotic dose of zfra .

again, l <dig> cells were then electroporated with apoptosis-inducing amounts of wox <dig> and/or zfra, followed by culturing for  <dig> and  <dig> hr, and then processing for cell cycle analysis by facs. wox <dig> or zfra alone induced growth suppression and apoptosis, as evidenced by increases in the subg <dig> phase and decreases in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle in cell populations post transfection for  <dig> hr . however, when in combination, zfra and wox <dig> failed to synergistically increase cell death . similar results were observed by testing zfra with jnk <dig> . overall, zfra physically interacts with wox <dig> and jnk <dig>  and may counteract the apoptotic function of these proteins under stress conditions.

phosphorylation at tyr <dig> is essential for wox <dig> to counteract zfra-mediated apoptosis
phosphorylation of wox <dig> at tyr <dig> is essential for its apoptotic function  <cit> . in parallel with the above observations , overexpressed wox <dig> did not synergistically increase cell death with zfra in cos <dig> cells . also, alteration of tyr <dig> to arg  abolished the apoptosis-inducing activity of wox <dig> . this y33r mutant could not bind zfra , and did not affect zfra-mediated cell death . this relationship was further verified in breast mda-mb- <dig> cells .

we tested the function of sdr domain and a c-terminal tail  in wox <dig> . l <dig> cells were transfected with cdna constructs for expressing sdr or sdr/c, followed by culturing for  <dig> hr in the presence or absence of a synthetic full-length zfra peptide . transiently overexpressed sdr/c exerted cell death. zfra peptide alone had no effect but enhanced cell death caused by sdr/c . sdr alone could not cause cell death and zfra and sdr, in combination, did not increase the cell death . together, these observations indicate a critical role of tyr <dig> phosphorylation in wox <dig> in causing cell death and interacting with zfra. also, when zfra binds to the c-terminal sdr/c region, both zfra and wox <dig> may enhance cell death in a synergistic manner.

protein expression of ecfp-sdr/c and ecfp-sdr is shown. the extent of protein expression was in more than 70% of transfected cells, as determined by fluorescence microscopy. constructs made for the above experiments are shown .

phosphorylation of p <dig> at ser <dig> is essential for counteracting zfra-mediated apoptosis
similarly, overexpressed p <dig> and zfra nullified each other's effect in inducing death of cos <dig> cells . zfra mutant lost its apoptotic function , and had no effect in counteracting p53-mediated cell death . mutant p <dig> had a reduced activity in causing cell death, and interestingly this mutant also inhibited zfra's apoptotic function . the extent of protein expression was more than 70%, as determined by fluorescence microscopy.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have shown that the small size zfra regulates tnf-mediated cell death via directly binding with tradd, nf-κb, jnk <dig>  p-erk and wox <dig>  and indirectly with fadd, rip and p <dig> . upon binding with p <dig> tnf receptor , tnf engages in two signaling pathways for either protecting cells from death or committing cells to death. for initiating cell death, p55-tnfr recruits tradd, fadd and rip to generate a death-inducing signaling complex  . caspase  <dig> is then recruited to the disc and becomes activated, followed by activating downstream caspases to induce apoptosis at both the mitochondrial and nuclear levels  <cit> .

we determined that zfra interacts with tradd but not fadd or rip . zfra affects the cytotoxic function of these death domain proteins via direct and indirect manners . zfra physically interacts with wox <dig>  and that wox <dig> binds tradd. thus, zfra and wox <dig> are likely to be recruited to the disc during tnf signaling . this assumption has yet to be validated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal and immunoelectron microscopy.

previously we have shown that wox <dig> enhances tnf cytotoxicity  <cit> . wox <dig> also enhances the cytotoxic function of tradd  <cit> . here we determined that both wox <dig> and zfra counteract with each other in regulating apoptosis. zfra either enhances or inhibits the function of death domain proteins. thus, the driving force for committing cells to death in response to tnf is likely coming from a balanced and counter-balanced work among zfra, wox <dig> and disc.

in the tnf-initiated protective pathway, zfra is shown to interact with tradd, jnk <dig> and nf-κb . thus, formation of zfra-containing regulatory complexes probably occurs in the tnf signaling cascade. in step  <dig>  at the membrane level, zfra binds tradd in the presence of tradd, traf <dig>  rip and wox <dig>  in step  <dig>  a trimolecular complex of zfra/jnk1/wox <dig> may form when jnk <dig> becomes activated by the upstream activated mek. zfra binds and counteracts the apoptotic function of jnk <dig>  also, jnk <dig> counteracts the apoptotic function of wox <dig>  <cit> . in step  <dig>  mek activates erk, and that zfra may bind and sequester erk to the cytoplasm. in step  <dig>  phosphorylation of iκbα by ikk causes degradation of iκbα and release of nf-κb for nuclear translocation. again, zfra is able to bind and sequester nf-κb in the cytoplasm. in step  <dig> and  <dig>  p <dig> is a downstream effector of tnf signaling  <cit> . tnf induces nf-κb activation, and then nf-κb activates p <dig>  <cit> . the non-ankyrin c-terminus of iκbα physically interacts with cytosolic p <dig> to prevent degradation in vivo, and the complex dissociates in response to tnf and apoptotic stress  <cit> . p <dig> is functionally associated with wox <dig>  and both proteins may induce apoptosis synergistically  <cit> . thus, an in vivo complex of iκbα/p53/wox <dig> is likely , and that zfra may regulate the formation of this complex. we show that ectopic zfra blocks uv light-induced p <dig> nuclear translocation or activation, suggesting a negative regulation for the cell death event. ser46-phosphorylated p <dig> is known to play a critical role in apoptosis  <cit> . that is, zfra may prevent cell death by blocking the apoptotic function of ser46-phosphorylated p <dig>  the iκbα/p53/wox <dig> or p53/wox <dig> may translocate to the mitochondria . whether this event is blocked by zfra is unknown.

presence of two cysteine residues in the amino acid sequence of zfra suggests the likely presence of a dimeric form in cells  <cit> . also, whether zfra covalently interacts with specific proteins remains to be established. as determined by gst-pull down analysis, both tnf and uv light are able to increase self-association of zfra, supporting the presence of dimers in vivo  <cit> . zfra is inducible under stress conditions  <cit> . we show that at low levels zfra enhances cell growth, and yet overexpressed zfra induces cell death. ectopic zfra also blocked adherence-independent growth of l <dig> fibroblasts, suggesting that it may act as a tumor suppressor to block cancer growth and progression. zfra is most abundant in the spleen, whereas its role in regulating immune cell differentiation and functions is unknown. however, it is reasonable to suggest that zfra-regulated tnf signaling is likely to play a role in the lymphocyte differentiation. we also determined that absent expression of zfra is found in several breast and prostate cancer cell lines  <cit> , implying that zfra deficiency may provide a growth advantage for cancer cells. majority of zinc finger proteins participate in gene transcription and embryonic development  <cit> . synthetic peptides have been shown promises in therapy to modulate the transcriptional activities of endogenous zinc finger proteins  <cit> . shortening and/or modification of the naturally occurring zfra may be of therapeutic value in controlling cancer cell growth and death.

zfra is distributed ubiquitously in cellular compartments. in response to tnf, a portion of cytosolic zfra appears to translocate to the cell membrane area and binds tradd. death domain/death domain interaction is responsible for tradd binding with p55-tnfr, fadd and rip. whether zfra binds to the death domain is unknown. sequence alignment analysis shows a common structural motif in tradd, jnk <dig>  nf-κb, and the n-terminal ww domain and c-terminal sdr domain of wox <dig>  whether this motif interacts with zfra remains to be established.

wwox/wox <dig> is known to interact with p <dig>  p <dig>  jnk <dig>  ap-2γ, and erbb <dig>  <cit> , suggesting its role of the regulation of gene transcription. both in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that overexpressed wwox1/wox <dig> suppresses tumor growth in nude mice, and induces apoptosis in cultured cells  <cit> . overexpressed ww and sdr/c domains induce cell death  <cit> . most interestingly, the c-terminal tail of wox <dig> is needed to work together with sdr in causing cell death. in stark contrast, non-invasive breast and prostate cancers may have upregulated expression of wwox/wox <dig>  tyr <dig> phosphorylation and wwoxv2/wox <dig>   <cit> . downregulation of wox <dig> and wox <dig> promotes neurodegeneration in alzheimer's disease, suggesting its protective role against neurodegeneration  <cit> . for  is shown to protect against the effects of ionizing radiation in drosophila  <cit> . these observations support a pro-survival role of wox <dig> in vivo  <cit> .

in domain/domain mapping by yeast two-hybrid analysis, zfra was shown to bind the n-terminal tyr33-phosphorylated ww domain of wox <dig>  alteration of this phosphorylation site abolishes the binding interaction. also, it interacts with the c-terminal sdr domain of wox <dig>  since zfra is a small peptide, its simultaneous binding to these domains in wox <dig> under physiologic and stress conditions is very likely. our supporting evidence shows that stress stimuli induce phosphorylation of wox <dig> at tyr <dig> and zfra at ser <dig>  and that the zfra/wox <dig> complex co-translocates to the mitochondria to regulate cell death via the mitochondrial pathway . also, in this study we found that zfra enhances the apoptotic activity of sdr domain and the c-terminal tail of wox <dig> 

overexpressed zfra may nullify the apoptotic activities of wox <dig> and p <dig>  an apparent mechanism is that overexpressed zfra sequesters transcriptional factors in the cytoplasm. for example, ectopic zfra restricts nuclear localization of endogenous wox <dig>  p <dig>  erk, and nf-κb , indicating that an upregulated level of zfra may control the transcriptional system in cells under stress conditions.

taken together, we have identified a molecular pathway underlying zfra regulation of tnf cytotoxic function. zfra interacts with tradd and binds downstream nf-κb, p <dig>  jnk <dig> and wox <dig> of the tnf signal pathway, thereby either enhancing or restricting tnf-mediated cell death.
