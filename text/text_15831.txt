BACKGROUND
inflammatory bowel disease , consisting of two idiopathic inflammatory disorders, crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation, which causes severe destruction of the mucosa of the colorectal system  <cit> . an intense, local immune response is like to be responsible for the initiation and progress of the inflammatory process. a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α , interleukin-1β , il- <dig>  il- <dig>  and interferon-γ, are involved in these inflammatory processes. thus, one potential therapeutic strategy for ibd is to repress these inflammatory processes by using anti-inflammatory cytokines, extracellular domains of the receptors of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antagonists and antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines. gene therapy approaches are particularly attractive for such therapeutic strategies, since local, long-term expression of therapeutic proteins in the colorectal system is potentially achievable. previous studies primarily used adenoviral vectors , derived from adenovirus serotype  <dig>  as gene transfer agents for the inflamed colon. although the colorectal system is readily accessible externally, the presence of the mucous coat on the colonic epithelium and the dynamic fluidic properties of the colorectal system act as barriers for the access to the colonic tissue by viral vectors that are administered intracolonically. thus, administration of relatively large amounts of ad <dig> was required to achieve sufficient levels of transgene expression in the colon  <cit> . we recently showed by using ad <dig> with a mouse chemically induced colitis model that the transduction efficiency of the inflamed colon by ad <dig> was very poor when administered intracolonically in free form, but that it was enhanced considerably when ad <dig> was used in the form of ad5-microbead conjugates bearing a lectin, concanavalin a , which serves as an effective anchoring agent for the conjugates  <cit> . when an ad <dig> construct carrying the gene for mouse il- <dig>  a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that is among the most promising protein therapeutics for ibd  <cit> , was administered intracolonically in the form of ad5-microbead conjugates bearing con a, a considerable increase in the local il- <dig> level in the colon was seen. this suggests that intracolonical administration of viral vectors carrying the genes for il- <dig> and other therapeutic proteins may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for ibd. however, the use of ad <dig> for gene therapy of ibd may be limited to short-term therapeutic strategies, since commonly used ad <dig> constructs are incapable of establishing long-term expression of transgenes and induce immune responses to transduced cells due to the expression of viral genes that are also present in the viral genome. viral vector species that can provide sustained expression of therapeutic transgenes may be more useful for long-term therapy of ibd.

adeno-associated viral vectors  are among the most frequently used viral vector species for in vivo gene therapy applications  <cit> . aav, derived from adeno-associated virus serotype  <dig> , has primarily been used, and extensive effort is being made to modify or engineer its properties, such as the infectivity and tropism. recent studies are also focused on the development and characterization of aav constructs that are derived from other serotypes and variants. aav possesses several attractive characteristics as in vivo gene transfer agents: aav is associated with no known pathogenesis, does not stimulate cell-mediated immune responses, has the ability to transduce a wide range of cell types , and has the ability to establish long-term expression of transgenes. these multiple attractive properties, particularly its ability to provide sustained expression of transgenes, suggest that aav may serve as a useful viral vector species for the development of gene therapy strategies for ibd. however, to our knowledge, aav-based vectors were not previously tested for the transduction of the inflamed colon.

in the present work, we investigated if aav <dig> could be used for efficient transduction of the inflamed colon in mice toward its application to gene therapy of ibd. aav <dig>  when used in free form, showed a limited ability to transduce colonic cell lines in vitro. in addition, the transduction efficiency of the inflamed colon in a mouse colitis model was very poor when free aav <dig> was administered intracolonically by enema. thus, we examined if the transduction efficiencies of colonic cell lines and the inflamed colon in mice could be enhanced by the delivery of aav <dig> in the form of virus-microbead conjugates bearing lectin as an anchoring agent.

RESULTS
we initially investigated, by using in vitro systems, the infectivity of aav <dig> for two colonic cell lines, colo  <dig>  and mip- <dig> , along with the human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line hela, which is known to be highly permissive to infection by aav <dig>  we used an aav <dig> construct, aav <dig> cmv-lacz, which carries the bacterial lacz  gene under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate/early promoter. the infectivity of aav <dig> cmv-lacz in free form for these two colonic cell lines was lower by one to two orders of magnitude than that for hela cells , suggesting that colonic cells may be poorly permissive to infection by aav <dig>  this result prompted us to investigate if the delivery of aav <dig> to target cells in the form of virus-microbead conjugates could enhance the transduction efficiency of colonic cells.

preparation of virus-microbead conjugates with aav <dig>  essentially followed the method established for ad <dig>  <cit>  with the optimization of each step. in this method, biotin groups are attached covalently to the surfaces of viral particles by biotinylation using a water-soluble, amino-reactive biotinylation reagent , followed by the removal of non-virion-associated biotinylation reagent. the resulting surface-biotinylated viral particles are attached to microbeads, on which the biotin-binding protein, avidin or streptavidin  <cit> , is immobilized covalently in high density . optimal conditions for the surface biotinylation of aav <dig> particles, where the viral surfaces are biotinylated without disturbing the viral infectivity, were initially determined. aav <dig> cmv-lacz was treated with varying concentrations of sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin at room temperature  for  <dig> min in the dark, followed by the termination of biotinylation reaction. the resulting aav <dig> particles were analyzed for their infectivity on hela cells that are highly permissive to infection by aav <dig> . the viral infectivity decreased sharply with increasing the concentration of sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin during biotinylation reaction, as seen previously with the biotinylation of ad <dig>  <cit> . when the concentration of sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin was  <dig>  mg/ml or higher, considerable reduction of the viral infectivity was seen . however, treatment with sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin at concentrations up to  <dig>  mg/ml showed a limited effect on the viral infectivity. this suggests that the surfaces of aav <dig> particles may be biotinylated by using sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin in this concentration range with minimal effect on the viral infectivity. to test if the viral surfaces were indeed biotinylated, particularly when the concentration of sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin was relatively low, excess avidin was added to aav <dig> after biotinylation reaction, and the viral infectivity was then analyzed on hela cells. this method allows the assessment of the presence of biotin groups on the viral surfaces, since the viral infectivity is significantly reduced by the binding of avidin to viral-surface biotin groups, as shown previously for biotinylated ad <dig> particles  <cit> . the addition of excess avidin severely reduced the infectivity of aav <dig> particles that had been treated with sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin, while it showed little effect on the infectivity of unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz . when aav <dig> cmv-lacz was treated with sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin at concentrations of  <dig>  mg/ml and higher, the addition of excess avidin ablated the viral infectivity completely . when aav <dig> cmv-lacz was treated with  <dig> μg/ml sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin, the viral infectivity became slightly higher than that of unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz , but the addition of excess avidin reduced the viral infectivity considerably . this suggests that the treatment of aav <dig> with sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin at this concentration can maximally maintain the viral infectivity, while the viral surfaces can indeed be biotinylated. repeated experiments reveal that the optimal conditions for surface biotinylation of aav <dig> particles involve the treatment with sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin at  <dig> –  <dig> μg/ml, where the viral infectivity is hardly affected and the majority, if not all, of the viral particles are indeed biotinylated.

preparation of aav2-microbead conjugates was carried out by using aav <dig> cmv-lacz that had been treated with  <dig> μg/ml sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin as above. after the termination of biotinylation reaction, biotinylated aav <dig> particles were dialyzed to remove non-virion-associated biotinylation reagent and mixed with avidin-coated fluorescent microbeads, in which a rhodamine derivative is encapsulated  . infectivity analysis of the supernatant after the centrifugation of the mixtures revealed that greater than 95% of the aav <dig> particles used were bound to avidin-coated microbeads, indicating that the binding of biotinylated aav <dig> particles to avidin-coated microbeads was highly efficient. the resulting aav2-microbead conjugates  were analyzed for their infectivity on hela, colo  <dig>  and mip- <dig> cells. the infectivity of these aav2-microbead conjugates was lower than or equivalent to free, unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz  . this suggests that the ability of these conjugates to associate with target cells may be similar to that of free aav <dig> particles, since the microbeads, used as carriers of aav <dig> particles, have physiological specific gravity. this notion was supported by fluorescence microscopic analysis of target cells, in which only limited amounts of cell-associated fluorescence, derived from the avidin-coated microbeads used, were seen after aav2-microbead conjugates were applied and incubated for  <dig> hr .

we previously showed with ad5-microbead conjugates  <cit>  that the co-attachment of a lectin, con a, to the microbead surface allowed the conjugates to associate stably with target cells due to the ability of con a to bind to commonly occurring α-d-mannosyl moieties in cell-surface carbohydrate chains, resulting in efficient transduction of the target cells. we assessed if the ability of aav2-microbead conjugates to associate with target cells and subsequently transduce them could also be enhanced by the co-attachment of lectins on the microbead surfaces. aav2-microbead conjugates were prepared as above , and then biotinylated forms of several lectins with different carbohydrate specificities  were co-attached to the microbead surfaces. these conjugates were analyzed for their infectivity on hela, colo  <dig>  and mip- <dig> cells . for hela cells, which are highly permissive to infection by free aav <dig>  the co-attachment of lectins to the microbead surface showed little effect on the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates . in contrast, the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates on colo  <dig> and mip- <dig> cells was enhanced considerably when certain lectins were co-attached to the microbead surfaces. in particular, the co-attachment of con a showed dramatic enhancement of the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates for these colonic cell lines . when colo  <dig> cells were used as targets, the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a became approximately 30-fold higher than those of free, unmodified aav <dig> or aav2-microbead conjugates without lectin . similarly, the co-attachment of con a enhanced the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates for mip- <dig> cells by approximately 4-fold, as compared to free, unmodified aav <dig> or aav2-microbead conjugates without lectin . no appreciable effect on the morphology and viability of target cells was seen for any of these cell lines when con a was co-attached to the microbead surfaces. other lectins tested showed little effect on the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates on colo  <dig> and mip- <dig> cells, except for castor bean agglutinin i that enhanced the infectivity of the conjugates for colo  <dig> cells by approximately 8-fold . the considerable infectivity enhancement of aav2-microbead conjugates by the co-attachment of con a for these poorly permissive colonic cell lines may be derived from the fact that con a binds to α-d-mannosyl moieties that are commonly and abundantly present in cell-surface carbohydrate chains, allowing the conjugates to associate with target cells with much higher efficiencies.

the effect of the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead on the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a was analyzed for the three cell lines used above, along with a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, sw <dig>  which was previously found to have an even lower permissivity to infection by free aav <dig> than colo  <dig> and mip- <dig> cells. aav2-microbead conjugates were prepared with varying numbers of aav <dig> particles per microbead . the infectivity of these conjugates with and without the co-attachment of con a, along with free, unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz as a control, was analyzed . in this analysis, the amount of total aav <dig> particles per well was kept constant for each cell line. this means that the total number of aav2-microbead conjugates per well decreased with increasing the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead. for hela cells that are highly permissive to infection by free aav <dig>  the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead had little effect on the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates, which was similar to that of free aav <dig>  the co-attachment of con a to the microbead surfaces also showed little effect on the infectivity of the conjugates , suggesting that the infection process was initiated primarily by direct binding of aav <dig> particles on the microbead surfaces to cell-surface heparan sulfate, not by the binding of con a on the microbead surfaces to cell-surface carbohydrate chains. in contrast, the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead showed a dramatic effect on the infectivity of the conjugates for the three colonic cell lines, particularly when con a was co-attached to the microbead surfaces. for colo  <dig> and mip- <dig> cells, the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead had a limited effect on the infectivity when aav2-microbead conjugates were used without the co-attachment of con a. however, when con a was co-attached to the microbead surfaces, the infectivity of the conjugates became higher than those without con a, and the highest infectivity was seen when the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead was  <dig>  for both colo  <dig> and mip- <dig> cell lines. similarly, both free aav <dig> and aav2-microbead conjugates without con a had extremely low infectivity for sw <dig> cells, but the co-attachment of con a to the microbead surfaces substantially enhanced the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates , particularly when the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead was  <dig> . repeated experiments reveal that the infectivity of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a for these poorly permissive colonic cell lines became maximal when the number of aav <dig> particles per microbead was in a range between  <dig> and  <dig> 

the results of in vitro experiments described above suggest that aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a may offer enhanced transduction of the colon over free aav <dig> and aav2-microbead conjugates without lectin when administrated intracolonically by enema. to test this, we used a mouse acute colitis model, in which colonic inflammation was induced chemically by intracolonical administration of  <dig> ,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid   <cit> . aav2-microbead conjugates were prepared using aav <dig> cmv-lacz at  <dig> aav <dig> particles per microbead. these conjugates with the co-attachment of con a were administered intracolonically into mice with tnbs-induced colitis by enema . as controls, free, unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz and aav2-microbead conjugates without con a were administered in the same manner. at 48-hr post-administration, mice were euthanized, and their colons were collected, fixed, and sectioned. these colon sections were stained for lacz expression using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside  as the substrate . when free aav <dig> cmv-lacz was administered intracolonically, no appreciable expression of the lacz gene was seen , indicating the low permissivity of colonic tissue to infection by free aav <dig>  the transduction efficiency of the inflamed colon remained very low when aav <dig> cmv-lacz was used in the form of aav2-microbead conjugates without con a . in contrast, intracolonical administration of aav <dig> cmv-lacz in the form of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a resulted in very efficient transduction of the colonic tissue . transduction was seen primarily in the mucosal layer, to which administered aav2-microbead conjugates should have easy access due to its destruction caused by colonic inflammation. absorptive and goblet cells in the colon epithelium, along with lamina propria in crypts, were primarily transduced. in addition, the muscularis mucosa and the sub-mucosal layer may also be transduced, suggesting that aav2-microbead conjugates not only infected the surfaces of colonic epithelia but also migrated into and subsequently transduced colonic tissue. since colonic epithelial cells actively turn over and are rapidly shed, the transduction of these cells alone should provide only short-term production of therapeutic proteins in the inflamed colon, offering limited effectiveness for the therapy of ibd. in contrast, the transduction of other cell types in the muscularis mucosa and the sub-mucosal layer should offer sustained expression of transgenes, which should be useful for the development of long-term therapeutic strategies for ibd.

we also investigated the spatial relationship between transduction sites and the location of tissue-associated microbeads in colon sections from mice, which received aav2-microbead conjugates with and without the co-attachment of con a . colon sections were initially stained for lacz expression using x-gal as the substrate, and stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope to detect microbead-derived red fluorescence. few microbeads were detected in colonic tissue, which received aav2-microbead conjugates without con a . this suggests that these conjugates have a limited ability to associate with colonic tissue upon intracolonical administration. in contrast, many tissue-associated microbeads were seen in colon sections when aav <dig> was used in the form of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a , suggesting that the co-attachment of con a allowed the conjugates to associate stably with colonic tissue upon intracolonical administration. the same colon sections were then counter-stained with eosin/phloxine b and examined under a light microscope to detect the transduction by aav <dig>  efficient transduction was seen at locations where many tissue-associated microbeads were present. this reveals that the co-attachment of con a makes aav2-microbead conjugates capable of associating stably with colonic tissue, allowing the attached aav <dig> particles to mediate efficient transduction of colonic cells.

discussion
in the present study, we have demonstrated that aav2-microbead conjugates bearing con a can serve as efficient gene transfer agents both for colonic cell lines in vitro and for the inflamed colon in a mouse colitis model. con a was found to be an effective anchoring agent for aav2-microbead conjugates, providing efficient transduction of target cells and tissues both in vitro and in vivo. the infectivity enhancement by the co-attachment of con a is likely derived from the ability of con a on the microbead surfaces to allow the conjugates to associate stably with target cells or tissues due to its ability to bind to commonly occurring α-d-mannosyl moieties in cell-surface carbohydrate chains. the ability to associate stably with target tissue may be particularly important for the transduction of the colorectal system, where the dynamic fluidic properties inhibit stable association of viral particles with colonic tissues. we also analyzed the transduction of the normal colons  in mice by aav <dig> upon intracolonical administration. under the conditions used for the transduction of the colons with tnbs-induced colitis , no appreciable transduction of the normal colons was seen when aav <dig> was used either in free form or in the form of aav2-microbead conjugates with or without the co-attachment of con a . these results suggest that the exposure of colonic tissue by the destruction of the mucous coat on the colonic epithelium upon the development of tnbs-induced colitis is critical for aav-microbead conjugates bearing con a to associate stably to the colonic tissue and subsequently transduce colonic cells.

a different strategy for the construction of aav2-microbead conjugates was previously reported  <cit> . in this strategy, microbeads are coated with the primary receptor of aav <dig>  heparan sulfate, to which unmodified aav <dig> particles are attached. we tested this strategy in vitro by using avidin-coated microbeads with physiological specific gravity, used in this study, with unmodified aav <dig> cmv-lacz. no appreciable enhancement of the infectivity was seen with these aav2-microbead conjugates, as compared to free aav <dig> cmv-lacz, when analyzed using cultured colonic cell lines . this may be derived from the physiological specific gravity of such conjugates, with which their ability to associate with target cells may be similar to that of free aav <dig>  as seen with aav2-microbead conjugates without lectin in this study. the presence of large amounts of heparan sulfate on the microbead surfaces may also inhibit efficient binding of attached aav <dig> particles to cell-surface heparan sulfate. in addition, this strategy does not allow the co-attachment of other materials on the microbead surfaces, to which aav <dig> particles have been conjugated. thus, the use of such conjugates for the transduction of the inflamed colon may be limited, since their association with colonic tissue upon intracolonical administration should be inefficient without the co-attachment of an appropriate anchoring agent, such as con a. in contrast, a key strength of our strategy is that almost any materials can readily be co-attached to the microbead surfaces, to which aav <dig> particles  have been conjugated. this should allow the properties and functionality of aav2-microbead conjugates to be controlled or engineered in a systematic manner. in addition, our strategy should be applicable to aav-based vectors that are derived from not only aav <dig> but also other serotypes and variants. this should make our strategy applicable to the transduction of a wide range of cell types and tissue targets.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has demonstrated that the delivery of aav <dig> in the form of aav2-microbead conjugates bearing the lectin con a provides considerable enhancements of the transduction efficiency both for poorly permissive colonic cell lines in vitro and for the inflamed colon in mice upon intracolonical administration by enema. in particular, the co-attachment of con a to the microbead surfaces as an anchoring agent was found essential for efficient transduction of colonic cells by aav2-microbead conjugates both in vitro and in vivo. with this efficient aav2-mediated transduction system for the inflamed colon, it should now be possible to investigate, systematically, the efficacy of potential gene therapy strategies for ibd by using the genes for a variety of different protein therapeutics. such protein therapeutics should include the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  antibodies against the pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α, and the extracellular domain of the tnf-α receptor, each of which has shown potential effectiveness for the therapy of ibd.
