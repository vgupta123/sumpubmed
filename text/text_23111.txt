BACKGROUND
with the advent of high-throughput biotechnologies to genotype dense molecular markers throughout the genome, statistical methodologies are crucial in understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits, and in locating genes underlying important traits. since the pioneering statistical work by lander and botstein  <cit> , much effort has been devoted to improving the efficiency and accuracy of qtl mapping. traditional approaches to qtl mapping test each of dense grid loci on chromosomes via the likelihood ratios of linear regression models , and wang et al.  <cit>  also proposed a bayesian shrinkage estimation of qtl parameters allowing varying shrinkage factors across different effects.

epistases  are ubiquitous in biological systems  <cit>  and may even play a more important role than additive effects, as have been shown in human population  <cit>  and other organisms  <cit> . however, even a moderate number of markers implies a large number of pairwise combinations, thus creating statistical issues in qtl mapping. due to the small sample sizes and the lack of efficient statistical tools, the number of identified genes is limited although the existence of epistasis has been recognized for nearly a hundred years  <cit> . to detect epistatic effects, kao and zeng  <cit>  proposed modeling epistasis via orthogonal contrast scales using cockerham's model; yi and xu  <cit>  developed a bayesian method to detect epistasis using reversible jump markov chain monte carlo  algorithm; yi et al.  <cit>  then proposed a bayesian model selection approach to detect genome-wide epistasis ; bogdan et al.  <cit>  modified bayesian information criterion  to permit the identification of additive effects as well as pairwise interactions; and cui and wu  <cit>  also proposed a statistical framework to detect genetic interactions derived from different genomes in self-pollinated plants. recently, Żak et al.  <cit>  developed a rank-based model selection and shi et al.  <cit>  developed a lasso-type penalized likelihood method to locate interacting qtl while bogdan et. al  <cit>  extended mbic for strongly correlated markers and multiple interval mapping.

consider yi as the trait value of strain i =  <dig>  ⋯, n, and let xij be the genotypic value of marker j =  <dig>  ⋯, pβ within the i-th strain. here we focus on the populations with binary markers xij , such as doubled-haploid, backcross or recombinant inbred lines. with available markers  densely located on chromosomes, we assume the putative qtl co-transmit with some of the markers. let i{x} denote the set including all pairwise epistases of interest, and define zij = xik xil for the j-th candidate epistasis  ∈ i{x}, j =  <dig>  ⋯, pγ. we investigate the additive effects of putative qtl and the epistatic interactions between them through the following multiple regression model,

  yi=μ+∑j=1pββjxij+∑j=1pγγjzij+εi,εi~iidn, 

where μ is the overall mean, βj is the additive effect of marker j, γj represents the j-th epistatic effect, and εi is the random error.

qtl mapping with this multiple regression model can be viewed as a model selection procedure  <cit> . however, several characteristics of the data complicate the application of classical statistical methodologies. first, a large amount of missing molecular markers, due to failure in genotyping or selective genotyping, is common in practice. when markers are sparse, the missing genotype information between markers must be inferred. second, the molecular markers in the same linkage group may be highly correlated. third, the total number of molecular markers and putative epistases, i.e., p = pβ + pγ, is usually much larger than the sample size n. because of these issues, the efficiency and accuracy are usually compromised for easy development of statistical approaches. characteristics of the "large p small n" data with missing values require further attention via extensions of traditional model selection approaches. we extend the bayesian classification approach in zhang et al.  <cit>  to map qtl with epistases. spike and slab priors have been used by, for example, mitchell and beauchamp  <cit> , george and mcculloch  <cit> , and ishwaran and rao  <cit>  to develop bayesian variable selection approaches. the spike and slab priors consist of two components, with one modeling zero coefficients and the other modeling non-zero ones.

furthermore, the mixing weight plays a crucial role in condensing the searchable parameter space and enforcing a stochastic search within low-dimensional spaces. when only a limited number of covariates are being investigated, a uniform distribution on  <cit>  or even a fixed value  is usually chosen for the mixing weight. however, when n ≪ p, it is unrealistic to expect half of the variables to be selected because the final model may still be unidentifiable. instead, we expect that, for a successful variable selection, the prior distributions of the mixing weights depend on both n and p.

we investigate the predictability of a model developed for a dataset of sample size n, and tackle the aforementioned issues. we then construct a two-step bayesian variable selection approach for model  in the case that n ≪ . in the first step, we employ a restrictive prior for each of the coefficients in model  in order to enforce stochastic filtering of the large number of candidate variables. this prior also allows flexibility for the possible different numbers and/or scales of positive and negative coefficients . a gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to compute the posterior distributions and to implement the stochastic search. only a limited number of variables are filtered to go through the second step, which repeats the first step but with much fewer candidate variables. the second step is necessary to model  when n ≪ , as the priors in the first step could potentially be too restrictive. the performance of our approach is evaluated via a simulation study and application to real datasets.

RESULTS
simulation
simulation studies were performed to evaluate the performance of our method in the case of p ≫ n. we simulated  <dig> markers across  <dig> chromosomes, with each having  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> markers, and being  <dig>  cm,  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm long respectively. we specify σε <dig> =  <dig> , and the locations of  <dig> markers are chosen based on the drosophila data  <cit> , which include  <dig> inbred introgression lines between two closely related species. the other  <dig> markers are chosen such that the neighboring markers are at least  <dig> cm away. table  <dig> shows the detailed information of the non-zero effects specified in the simulation, including two additive effects and three epistatic effects. to assess whether our method is able to identify different types of epistatic effects, we include all three possible interactions in the simulation:  neither of the two markers has additive effects ;  one of them has additive effects ;  both have additive effects . all epistatic effects were set at the same size to avoid its effects on detectability. due to the intensive computation involved in gibbs sampling, a total of  <dig> complete data sets were simulated. each of the  <dig> data sets was analyzed using two models, one model with both additive and epistatic effects while the other with additive effects only. when mapping qtl with epistases, we have a total number of  <dig> variables  versus  <dig> observations in the model.

each marker is referred by its chromosome index and its location on the chromosome.

for the model without epistases, both markers can be detected in most of the  <dig> simulated datasets even when the false discovery rate  is controlled as low as  <dig> , see table  <dig>  when modeling the epistases, all  effects are still detected in more than 90% of the data sets for all levels of bayes factor  though the fdrs are higher. for those data sets with any effect not identified, the immediate neighbors of the corresponding marker locus are mostly detected instead. as expected, it is more difficult to detect epistases than to detect additive effects. the epistasis of markers both having additive effects is the easiest to be detected among all epistases. the true parameter values are included in their 95% credible intervals with the associated posterior probabilities being very close to one .

out of  <dig> simulated data sets, the total numbers of data sets that correctly identify the true additive and interaction effects  are counted respectively when thresholding the bayes factor  at different levels. also listed are the mean and standard error  of the estimated effect sizes.

application
we apply the developed method to the simulans backcross ii  data and the mauritiana backcross ii  data  <cit> . an f <dig> population was first produced by females from an inbred line of d. simulans and males from an inbred line of d. mauritiana. then the f <dig> females were backcrossed to the parental line of d. simulans, which was fixed for different alleles at  <dig> marker loci, to produce a simulans backcross  population. a mauritiana backcross  population was also produced by backcrossing the f <dig> females to the other parental line. based on the two different times of crossing, a total of four data sets were obtained, namely, bs <dig> , bs <dig> , bm <dig> , and bm <dig> . the phenotypic value of an individual is a morphometric descriptor of the posterior lobe, obtained by averaging both sides of the first principal component  of the fourier coefficients of the posterior lobe. the genotypes of males were determined at each marker locus, and genetic map positions were estimated from gametes produced by the f <dig> females in this study. further information about the data is referred to liu et al.  <cit>  and zeng et al.  <cit> .

employing multiple interval mapping   <cit>  to the bs <dig> data, zeng et al.  <cit>  detected a total of  <dig> additive effects and no epistatic effect. pooling all four data sets, zeng et al.  <cit>  detected three extra additive effects and six epistatic effects. these epistatic effects appeared to be relatively unimportant for pc <dig> in the interspecific backcross populations, which carried an observation difficult to interpret biologically. of the  <dig> additive effects,  <dig> additive effect estimates have the same sign  <cit> . zeng et al.  <cit>  explained this interesting phenomena as an unusually strong directional selection, although tanksley  <cit>  suggested that transgressive segregation usually followed a mixture of plus and minus alleles in each species as demonstrated by most previous analyses of quantitative traits.

we focused our analysis on the bs <dig> and bm <dig> data with the standardized phenotypic values. of the  <dig> putative qtl reported by zeng et al.  <cit> , only nine are at least  <dig> cm away from the  <dig> marker loci. therefore, we analyzed both datasets with these  <dig> additive effects  and all possible pairwise interactions . when controlling bf ≥  <dig>  the analysis of the bs <dig> data reported a total of  <dig> additive effects , including all nine putative qtl, but no epistatic effect. the analysis of the bm <dig> data instead reported a total of  <dig> additive effects , including three of the nine putative qtl, and  <dig> epistatic effects . on the basis of the simulation study, we may expect less than  <dig> % fdr for those  <dig> and  <dig> additive effects reported with bf ≥  <dig> in analyzing the bs <dig> and bm <dig> data respectively. similarly, three epistatic effects reported in analyzing the bm <dig> data have bf ≥  <dig>  less than 12% of which may be false discoveries.

the position of each significant additive effect is specified by an index of the corresponding chromosome and its location on this chromosome . the estimated sizes of additive effects and the standard deviations of the markov chains are also shown in the columns of coefficient and s.d., respectively.

the qtl positions of each significant epistatic effect are specified by the indices of the corresponding chromosomes and the locations on the chromosomes . the estimated sizes of the epistatic effects and the standard deviations of the markov chains are also shown in the columns of coefficient and s.d., respectively.

interestingly, the  <dig> additive effects detected from the bs <dig> data include all those detected by zeng et al.  <cit>  except the 2– <dig>  3– <dig> and 3– <dig> , but the  <dig> additive effects detected from the bm <dig> data only include nine of those detected by zeng et al.  <cit> . on the other hand, nine additive effects  from the bs <dig> data are not reported by zeng et al.  <cit> , and eleven additive effects from the bm <dig> data  are not reported by zeng et al.  <cit> . note that almost each additive effect uniquely detected by zeng et al.  <cit>  has a neighboring one  in our lists except 2– <dig> and 3– <dig> for the bm <dig> dataset, and almost each additive effect unique in our lists has a neighboring one  detected by zeng et al.  <cit> . per the discussion on the precision of qtl location by bogdan and doerge  <cit>  and bogdan et al.  <cit> , these effects of close neighbors may be due to identical qtl. our analysis reported r <dig> =  <dig>  and r <dig> =  <dig>  for the bs <dig> and bm <dig> data respectively.

CONCLUSIONS
this article extends the bayesian framework in zhang et al.  <cit>  to identify both additive and epistatic effects of qtl based on model . the advantage of this approach mainly lies in the flexible priors for the regression coefficients by accounting for some characteristics of "large p small n" data, the predictability of a model constructed with size n data, and the two step strategy for dimension reduction. a gibbs sampler is developed to draw markov chain samples from the posterior distributions, which can be considered as a stochastic search for an optimal model. unlike information criteria based model selections which require calculation of the effective sample size for incomplete data, missing values can be naturally imputed within the gibbs sampling scheme. the corresponding algorithm has been implemented in matlab and is available as qtlbayes .

bayesian variable selections can be viewed as penalized likelihood approaches, which have been studied recently  <cit> . with "large p small n" data, it is not clear how to set up the penalty properly such that it will neither overpenalize nor underpenalize the likelihood. an overpenalized likelihood will lose some significant variables of particular interest, while an underpenalized likelihood will introduce false positives. the predictability of size n data sheds light on the choice of this penalty. since a size n data set will allow us to understand the variation of the trait explained by only pn = o qtl with accuracy o, selecting too many variables into the model will ruin this practice of qtl mapping. as shown by bogdan and doerge  <cit> , severely biased estimates can be resulted from large genome and/or marker number in qtl mapping. we propose a bayesian framework to resolve the bias problem. we have illustrated our approach by application to the bs <dig> and bm <dig> data  <cit> , both of which have  <dig> markers observed across three chromosomes. the disadvantage of this approach is the heavy computation involved as the computation-intensive markov chain monte carlo algorithm is utilized. for example, the analysis of a dataset with more than  <dig> markers from  <dig>  subjects take almost  <dig> hours using one intel® xeon™ cpu at  <dig>  ghz.

coding binary markers with - <dig>  and  <dig>  has been commonly utilized in qtl mapping as it does not introduce correlation between additive effects and interactive effects, and such uncorrelation benefits the identification of additive effects. on the other hand, coding binary markers with  <dig> and  <dig> introduces correlation and thus is not preferred for qtl mapping with epistases  <cit> . although developed for qtl mapping, this approach is completely general and can be applied to other settings with "large p small n" data, such as associating genomic features to clinical outcomes or phenotypes of biological interest. unlike qtl mapping data with known missing structure from the linkage information, genomic data with imaging and microarray may require more information to impute missing values because of the unknown missing mechanism. even though the missing values are usually imputed with a nearest-neighbor approach  <cit> , gibbs samplers allow natural multiple imputation under the assumption of missing at random .
