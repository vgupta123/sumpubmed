BACKGROUND
identification of co-regulated genes are helpful for solving many biological problems such as unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of specific cellular functions, identifying functionally related proteins and dissecting the gene regulatory networks  <cit> . the first step toward identifying co-regulated genes is to define the regulatory similarity  of two genes. gene regulation is a complex process, which involves various mechanisms: transcription factors  binding, mirnas binding, epigenetic modifications, etc. nowadays, various data related to these mechanisms, such as tf binding sites, mirna binding sites and histone modification patterns, are available for gene regulation study. among them, tf binding sites  have been the most widely used data. this is because that tfs binding to tfbss in promoters is the most crucial and well understood step in gene regulation.

to date, many studies have been proposed to use tfbs data to measure the regulatory similarity  of two genes  <cit> . however, existing tfbs-based rs measures consider the relation of a tfbs to a gene as a boolean  without utilizing the information of tfbs locations. in yeast and human, functional tfbss of many tfs are known to have a strong positional preference to occur in a small region in the promoters  <cit> . this biological knowledge prompts us to develop a novel rs measure that exploits the tfbs location information. following allocco et al.'s approach  <cit> , the performances of different rs measures are evaluated by the fraction of gene pairs that are co-regulated  by at least one common tf under different rs scores. the experimental results show that the proposed rs measure was the best co-regulation indicator among the six compared rs measures. in addition, the co-regulated genes identified by the proposed rs measure are also shown to be able to benefit three co-regulation-based applications: detecting gene co-function, gene co-expression and protein-protein interactions.

methods
this study proposes a novel rs measure using the tfbs location information. this section first describes the datasets used in this study and five existing tfbs-based rs measures followed by the proposed rs measure.

datasets
following previous studies in the literature, the promoter of a yeast gene in this study is defined as the intergenic region between this gene and its nearest non-overlapped upstream gene  <cit> . the genomic locations of the start and stop codons of  <dig> genes of saccharomyces cerevisiae  were retrieved from nagalakshmi et al.'s work  <cit> . the genomic locations of  <dig> tfbss of  <dig> yeast tfs were collected from the swissregulon database  <cit> , which deposited high-quality tfbs datasets predicted using bayesian probabilistic analysis. users can choose different posterior probability cutoffs to control the quality of the retrieved tfbss. this study adopted a moderate cutoff of  <dig>  and included a section to discuss the influence of the tfbs quality to the proposed rs measure.

existing tfbs-based rs measures
rs measures of two genes, a and b. tfa and tfb represent the tfs whose tfbss exist in the promoter of a and b, respectively. 1in eq. , n is the number of tfs whose binding sites are in the collected tfbs data, m=|tfa|, n=|tfb| and k=|tfa∩tfb|. 2equations  and  only show the final equations of the two works. the equation details can be found in the original manuscripts  <cit> .

the proposed rs measure
equations - consider the relation of a tfbs to a gene as a boolean  without utilizing the information of tfbs locations in the promoters. the biological knowledge that the biological relevance of tfbss is highly related to their locations in the promoters  <cit>  motivates us to introduce the tfbs location information into the rs measure as follows:

1tfa∪tfb ∑i∈tfa∩tfbl-dil, eq. 

where l is the longer promoter length of genes a and b, i is the i-th common tf that has tfbss in the promoters of both a and b, and di is the smallest distance between any two i-th common tf's tfbss in different promoters. in this context, di is called tfbs offset distance. a schematic explanation of eq.  is shown in figure  <dig>  where tfbss have different shapes for different tfs and have different colors for different genes where they locate. the two promoters of a and b are aligned by the start codons . to compute di, only the tfbss of the i-th common tf are used and those of other tfs are ignored . in figure  <dig>  a small di, which leads to a high rs, indicates that the tfbss of the i-th common tf in the two promoters are in a similar region.

RESULTS
small tfbs offset distances imply high regulatory similarity
this study is motivated by the biological knowledge that functional tfbss of many tfs in yeast are known to have a strong positional preference in the promoters  <cit> . because the critical regions in the promoters that make tfbss functional are unknown, eq.  is actually based on a derived hypothesis: if the offset distance of two tfbss of a common tf in two genes' promoters is small, the two tfbss are prone to co-present in the critical regions and therefore be co-functional. to investigate the practicability of the above hypothesis, a relation analysis of the co-functionality and the tfbs offset distance was conducted as follows. as shown in figure  <dig>  a tfbs offset distance can be computed given a tf t and two genes a and b, denoted as a <t, a, b> tuple. in this analysis, the co-functionality related to a tfbs offset distance was defined as the ratio of tuples in which the literature evidences collected by the yeastract database  <cit>  showed that tf t regulates both a and b to all tuples. the detailed steps are listed below:

- for a tf t, all gene pairs <a, b> whose promoters have the tfbs of t were collected.

- the tfbs offset distance  of t relative to <a, b> was calculated.

- a tuple <t, a, b> was stored in the bucket of the tfbs offset distance, bd, where d is the tfbs offset distance of <t, a, b>.

- after repeating 1- <dig> for all tfs, each bucket contains all tuples having the same tfbs offset distance.

- finally, the relation of d and the ratio of tuples in the bucket bd in which the literature evidences showed that tf t regulates both a and b to all tuples was plotted.

the results are shown in figure  <dig>  where each point is a bucket, the x-axis is the tfbs offset distance, while y-axis is the ratio of tuples in which the literature evidences showed that tf t regulates both a and b to all tuples. figure  <dig> shows an obvious linear relation , which suggest that the above hypothesis is practically usable. reviewing eq. , it implements this concept by incorporating di, where a common tf which has a smaller tfbs offset distance  has a larger value of l-dil.

the proposed rs measure is a good co-regulation indicator
following allocco et al.'s approach  <cit> , this study evaluated tfbs based rs measures by the fraction of gene pairs that are co-regulated  by at least one common tf under different rs scores. from the  <dig> yeast genes retrieved from nagalakshmi et al.'s work  <cit> ,  <dig> genes having no tfbss were excluded. the remaining  <dig> genes formed  <dig> gene pairs, where  <dig> head-to-head gene pairs  were further excluded. finally, the remaining  <dig> gene pairs were used as the evaluation dataset. figure  <dig> shows the results of eqs.  on the evaluation dataset. in figure  <dig>  the x-axis is the rs score obtained by different rs measures and the y-axis is the fraction of gene pairs that are co-regulated  by at least one common tf to all gene pairs under the corresponding rs scores.

the results show that the proposed rs score is highly correlated to the likelihood of a gene pair to be co-regulated by at least one common tf. the plot of the proposed rs measure  is increasing and smooth at most regions except the few points at left. it achieved a significantly higher r <dig>  of spearman rank correlation than random expectation with p-value less than  <dig> . in comparison with other rs measures, the r <dig> of the proposed measure is significantly higher than those of other existing rs measures . since the unique feature of the proposed rs measure is introducing tfbs location information, this shows that tfbs location information is useful in calculating regulatory similarity between two genes. the previous section showed the underlying hypothesis as well as a numerical evidence. the results in this section, furthermore, show that the implementation of eq.  of the hypothesis works. although the implementation of eq.  may incorrectly increase the weights of tfbss co-present in the non-critical regions, it effectively decreases the weights of those present in the critical region of one gene but in a non-critical region of the other gene.

p-values are calculated by one-tailed t-test.

the effects of tfbs qualities
the swissregulon database  <cit> , of which the tfbs data were used in this study, provides users a parameter of posterior probability to control the quality of the obtained tfbss. actually most resources of tfbs locations provide parameters such as chip-chip p-value and phylogenetic conservation and let users to choose the most appropriate values for their applications  <cit> . this section aims to figure out whether the tfbs quality affects the performance of the proposed rs measure and, if it does affect, what tfbs qualities are suggested.

case study
this section uses a case  to explain the performance advantage of the proposed rs measure. cct <dig> is a subunit of the cytosolic chaperonin cct ring complex. in this case study, yeast cct <dig> was of interest and its co-regulated genes were wanted. for this purpose, the rss of all yeast genes to cct <dig> were calculated and the  <dig> highest ranked genes were considered as co-regulated gene candidates of cct <dig> . to dig in the uniqueness of the proposed rs measure, we focused on a candidate, rpn <dig>  which is only identified by the proposed rs measure but not identified by the other five compared rs measures. we further dug into which genes were ranked before rpn <dig>  by the other rs measures and found an interesting opponent gene, rsc <dig>  against rpn <dig> 

1number of rs measures among the five compared ones  that also identified the genes. for example, the uniqueness of rpn <dig> is  <dig>  indicating that it is only identified by the proposed rs measure but not identified by the five compared ones.

to justify the correctness of the rank order, the biological relevance of common tfs were analyzed. in this study, a tf is defined biologically relevant to a gene if the literature evidences obtained from the yeastract database show that the tf regulates the gene. in figure  <dig>  all tfs with small tfbs offset distances are biologically relevant to both target genes  and abf <dig> to both cct <dig> and rsc <dig> in ). furthermore, all the other tfs, which have large tfbs offset distances, are not simultaneously relevant to both downstream genes. this suggests the correctness of the proposed rs measure as well as the importance of incorporating the information of tfbs locations.

good rs measure benefits co-regulation-based applications
co-regulated genes are considered to influence many biological behaviors and co-regulation measures have been used in various applications  <cit> . the section "the proposed rs measure is a good co-regulation indicator" shows that the proposed rs is a good co-regulation index over the five competitors. this section discusses whether this leads to a better result in three co-regulation-based applications: detecting gene co-function, gene co-expression and protein-protein interactions.

in this study, the scenario of detecting gene co-function, gene co-expression and protein-protein interactions using gene co-regulation was designed as follows. first, users have a target gene of interest. the rs score of the target gene against each gene in the genome is calculated. the n genes with the highest rss are called the regulatory neighborhood  to the target gene and n is called the neighborhood size. then the degree of co-function of the rn is evaluated using the functional enrichment score proposed by reimand et al.  <cit> , denoted as fes in this study. in fes, genes are considered to perform similar biological functions if they have similar gene ontology  terms  <cit> . the degree of co-expression of the rn is evaluated by the co-expression score proposed by yang and wu  <cit> , denoted as ces in this study. ces is the average of the pairwise expression correlations in the rn. the degree of protein-protein interactions of the rn is evaluated by the interaction enrichment score proposed by reimand et al.  <cit> , denoted as ies in this study. ies measures the tendency of forming protein complex modules of a rn.

the results of the proposed rs measure and the five existing rs measures in the three applications are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  the proposed rs measure achieved the highest performance among all the compared rs measures in all applications and all neighborhood sizes. in all three applications, the rs measures of van helden, veerla and höglund and garten et al. had similar performance and were the second best group.

CONCLUSIONS
