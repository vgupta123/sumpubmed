BACKGROUND
hemorrhagic shock is conceived as an insult frequently leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome , organ damage and multiple-organ dysfunction  <cit> . the mechanism of pathogenesis of sirs in the field of hemorrhagic shock is complex and a variety of mechanisms are implicated. the most widely recognized mechanisms are ischemia and reperfusion and stimulation of cells of the innate immune system  <cit> . ischemia and reperfusion is mainly participating in oxidative stress and sirs arising during post-ischemic resuscitation.

hemorrhagic shock/resuscitation can be viewed as a global ischemia/reperfusion injury insult  <cit> . the extent of tissue ischemia, that defines the degree of oxygen debt, correlates with a systemic inflammatory response that renders the injured patient at risk for post-resuscitation multiple organ failure   <cit> . tissue ischemia is determined by the magnitude of the hemorrhagic shock   <cit> .

regarding the duration of hemorrhagic shock it has been shown that the longer the shock persists the more intense is the inflammatory response that follows  <cit> . similarly, survival seems to improve with early resuscitation and mortality was high with delayed resuscitation and similar to that of unresuscitated animals  <cit> .

to our knowledge, the effect of the depth of hypotension on the oxidative and inflammatory responses at the post-resuscitation period has not been so far systematically explored. however, it has been shown that the depth of shock is a more important factor than the duration of shock in generating a higher mesenteric lymph flow at the post-shock period. likewise, this lymph engenders greater bioactivity as measured by human polymorhonuclears  priming for respiratory burst  <cit> . on the basis of this rationale, a particularly severe shock of even a short duration, can account for an intense sirs and/or early organ dysfunction that may follow, despite its prompt and vigorous management.

the aim of the present study therefore was to evaluate whether the level of hypotension during hemorrhagic shock may influence sirs developing during post-ischemic reperfusion. an experimental model in rabbits was designed.

methods
animals
the study was approved by the veterinary directorate of the prefecture of athens according to greek legislation in conformity with the 160/ <dig> council directive of the eu. a total of  <dig> adult male new zealand white rabbits of  <dig>  to  <dig>  kg body weight were used, fasted overnight with access to water ad libitum. they were pre-medicated with ketamine  and xylazine  intramuscularly.

study design
a marginal ear vein was cannulated, tracheostomy was performed and mechanical ventilation was instituted on a volume mode using a siemens  <dig> respirator. using a tidal volume of  <dig> ml/kg the frequency was adjusted to maintain paco <dig> at 33– <dig> mmhg. a mixture of air and oxygen was administered to keep pao <dig> at 95– <dig> mmhg. anesthesia was maintained using the aforementioned doses of ketamine and xylazine given intramuscularly every  <dig> minutes.

left and right carotid arteries and left internal jugular vein were catheterized for blood pressure monitoring, blood withdrawal for shock induction, and re-infusion of shed blood for shock resuscitation, respectively. the central body temperature was kept between 38° and 39°c with the aid of an electrical blanket.

a stabilization period of  <dig> min followed the termination of the experimental set-up. animals were randomly assigned to one of the following groups:

• group sham , animals which underwent all procedures of the experimental setup with the exception of shock; they were similarly mechanically ventilated during the entire experiment while ringer's lactate was given intravenously at a rate of  <dig>  ml/kg per minute

• group shock- <dig> , induction of shock by withdrawing blood from the left carotid in aliquots of  <dig>  ml per min in order to reduce the mean arterial pressure  to  <dig> mmhg over the next  <dig> minutes. map was maintained at  <dig> mmhg over the next  <dig> minutes by withdrawing or re-injecting blood as required.

• group shock- <dig> , induction of shock by withdrawing blood from the left carotid in aliquots of  <dig>  ml per min in order to reduce the mean arterial pressure  to  <dig> mmhg over the next  <dig> minutes. map was maintained at  <dig> mmhg over the next  <dig> minutes by withdrawing or re-injecting blood as required.

heparinized syringes with the shed blood were put on a horizontal rotator at 37°c at  <dig> rpm. the amounts of blood loss and of ringer's lactate given were recorded. after the  <dig> minutes of shock, resuscitation begun by infusing ringer's lactate twice volume of blood loss plus the shed blood by two different pumps into the left internal jugular vein over the same period as the induction of shock i.e.  <dig> minutes. fio <dig> was  <dig> – <dig>  to maintain pao <dig> to 90– <dig> mmhg. in all animals,  <dig> ml of blood was collected after venipuncture of their ear vein under aseptic conditions. since the maximal inflammatory  <cit>  and oxidative  <cit>  reaction seems to occur within 2-hour post-resuscitation in most studies, sampling was performed at the beginning of the induction of shock, at the end of shock and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes after the onset of resuscitation and were substituted with double volume of ringer's lactate. then animals were sacrificed to avoid their suffering by an intravenous lethal dose of sodium thiopental.

laboratory techniques
the serum levels of alanine aminotranferase , aspartate aminotransferase  and creatinine were estimated by standard techniques . those of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-1beta  and il- <dig> were measured by a rabbit enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the reagents were provided by the national institute for biological standards and control .

for the estimation of endotoxins , serum samples were diluted 1: <dig> in sterile and pyrogen-free water  and incubated for five minutes at 70°c. the concentration of lps was then measured by the kinetic qcl- <dig> limulus amoebocyte lysate assay  using a standard curve created by known concentrations of lps by escherichia coli serotype o111:b <dig>  all determinations were performed in duplicate and the mean of two observations was applied.

lipid peroxidation in serum was estimated by the concentration of mda, as already described  <cit> . briefly, a  <dig>  ml aliquot of each sample was mixed to  <dig>  ml of trichloroacetic acid 20%  and centrifuged at  <dig>  g and 4°c for  <dig> minutes. the supernatant was removed and incubated with  <dig> ml of thiobarbituric acid  <dig> %  for  <dig> minutes at 90°c. after centrifugation, a volume of  <dig> μl of the supernatant was injected into a high-performance liquid chromatography system  with the following characteristics of elution: zorbax eclipse xdb-c <dig>  column under 37°c; mobile phase consisting by a  <dig> mm k3po <dig>  buffer and methanol 99% at a 60/ <dig> ratio with a flow rate of  <dig> ml/min; fluorometric detection with signals of excitation at  <dig> nm and emission at  <dig> nm. the retention time of mda was  <dig>  minutes and it was estimated as μmol/ml by a standard curve created with  <dig> , <dig> -tetramethoxy-propane . all determinations were performed in duplicate.

total antioxidant status  was assessed in all serum samples by a colorimetric assay based on the decrease of the optical density of the blank produced by each sample in analogy to its antioxidant property . optical density was read at  <dig> nm . all determinations were done in duplicate and results were expressed as μmol/l.

oxidative burst of polymorphonuclear cells  and mononuclear cells  was assessed as described by others  <cit> . aliquots of  <dig> μl of whole blood were incubated with  <dig> μl of dichlorohydrofluoresceine diacetate    for  <dig> min at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% co <dig>  ddf-da is oxidized in cell cytoplasm by reactive oxygen species to  <dig>   <dig> -dichrorofluoresceine , which is a highly fluorescent compound . samples undergoing the same procedure but not loaded with ddf-da, served as negative controls for the determination of the baseline level. samples were analyzed by the facscalibur flow cytometer . two gates were set on mononuclear cells  and polymorphonuclear cells . for each measurement, at least  <dig> cells were acquired by forward and side-scatter characteristics. results were expressed as geometric mean of the fluorescence intensity  for gated cell populations.

statistical analysis
results were expressed as means ± sd or medians and range depending on the normal or non-normal distribution of values. comparisons between groups were performed by mann-whitney u test with post-hoc bonferroni analysis. any value of p below  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

discussion
hemorrhagic shock is a situation characterized by severe ischemia of perfused tissues. start of reperfusion of the ischemic tissues may lead to sirs, a process that many authors conceive as a result of the abundant generation of oxygen free radical species by the reperfused tissues  <cit> . however, no data exist in the literature for the role of shock per se to the contribution of post- reperfusion sirs. to elucidate that, an animal model of hemorrhagic shock was designed in rabbits. animals were separately bled either to map equal to  <dig> mm hg or to map equal to  <dig> mm hg. serum kinetics of pro-inflammatory mediators were compared between groups following resuscitation.

results revealed that reperfusion after shock was accompanied by hepatocellular injury and renal dysfunction evidenced by the rise of ast and creatinine serum levels, respectively . both ast and creatinine were higher among animals shocked at  <dig> mm hg than animals shocked at  <dig> mm hg revealing a propensity of shock at lower blood pressure for more severe organ dysfunction. in animals shocked at  <dig> mmhg, serum creatinine failed to increase above the values of sham-operated animals. this was not the case with animals shocked at  <dig> mmhg where serum creatinine started to increase within the first  <dig> minutes after start of resuscitation.

on the same content, in all shocked animals serum pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as serum mda and cellular oxidative burst was increased. this was accompanied by a reciprocal decrease of serum tas . these findings are consistent with the concept of ischemia and reperfusion injury arising through the generation of reactive oxygen species. however, pro-inflammatory cytokines were higher among animals previously shocked to map  <dig> mm hg than those shocked to map  <dig> mm hg , indicating that inflammation intensified along with the depth of arterial pressure during hemorrhagic shock.

however, leukocyte oxidative burst was similar  between the two groups as if it had already attained its maximal response at map  <dig> mmhg. although is likely that the depth of shock does not accordingly intensify the oxidative response, there are reasons that introduce uncertainty on this assumption:  in fact, ros formation rate might be higher in group shock- <dig> but since these were consumed at the sites of oxidative process they maintained similar blood levels with group shock-40; in that case however, mda should become higher with reciprocal lower tas levels in group shock- <dig>  which is not the case in the current model ;  there are potential limitations regarding the assays for the range of the actual molecules' concentration leading to a lack of difference; the assays, however, seem to detect reliably the concentrations of molecules, since their increase follows the progress of resuscitation .

in fact, the extension in the resuscitation period might reveal a difference in the oxidative response between the two groups. if not, the data may suggest that other factors, in addition to oxidative stress, contribute to the exacerbation of the inflammation and the organ injury that are observed with more severe hypotension during hemorrhagic shock. such a factor could be the rate of hemorrhage that was higher in the shock- <dig> than shock- <dig> animals to achieve the indicated difference of blood pressure in the same period of time. the higher rate of hemorrhage leading to acute hemorrhagic shock of particularly low arterial pressure may significantly contribute to the subsequent inflammatory response elicited through the early activation of nf-kb even in the absence of resuscitation procedures  <cit> .

many authors have suggested that bacterial translocation from the gut may participate in the pathogenesis of post-resuscitation sirs  <cit> . implication however of the above process is unlikely since serum lps did not differ between groups in the described setting .

a former study of our group revealed that serum of animals subjected to post-ischemic resuscitation may stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by u <dig> monocytes through a p38-map kinase-dependent mechanism  <cit> . it may be postulated that the factor circulating in serum creating the difference in serum kinetics of tnfα, il-1β and il- <dig> in the present study may act though the p38-map kinase pathway. this hypothesis is consistent with recent data by frink et al  <cit> . the authors have shown that cytokine production by kupffer cells following trauma-hemorrhage is mediated through the toll-like receptor- <dig> . stimulation of tlr <dig> is accompanied by intracellular activation of the p38-map kinase.

the administration of ringer's lactate as repletion fluid may represents a limitation of the study since it has been implicated in causing inflammatory reaction  <cit> . however, it appears unlikely that ringer's lactate was responsible for the observed difference of inflammatory response seen, because the volumes administered between the groups were similar. although in general, resuscitation results in greater proinflammatory gene transcription than no resuscitation  <cit> , ringer's lactate has been shown to possess similar effects to both colloids  <cit>  and normal saline  <cit>  on indices of inflammation.

CONCLUSIONS
the presented results show that the degree of hypotension determines the inflammatory reaction and the severity of hepatic and renal dysfunction that arise during post-ischemic hemorrhagic shock resuscitation. similar data are important for establishing the mechanistic link between the level of arterial blood pressure during shock and distant organ injury and for providing evidence in the continuing debate of the optimal resuscitation of post injury hemorrhagic shock.
