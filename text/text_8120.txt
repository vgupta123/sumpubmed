BACKGROUND
multiple sclerosis  is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system  that predominantly affects young adults. ms is highly heterogeneous and is considered by some authors to be a conglomerate of neurological syndromes, in which inflammatory damage and demyelination overlap with chronic neurodegeneration. this complexity means that current pharmacological treatments are directed towards modifying the course of the disease, although there is no effective cure for this pathology  <cit> . therefore, a better understanding of ms pathogenesis may help to establish new therapeutic strategies. in addition, improvement of early diagnostic tools could help speed up the initiation of ms treatments.

the etiology of ms remains unknown but it is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors deregulating the immune response  <cit> . vasculature plays a central role in the disease . alteration of endothelial barriers to small molecules and blood cells contribute to the leukocyte infiltration that causes inflammation and demyelination . endothelial permeability in the brain is altered in different clinical forms of ms even during the earlier stages of the disease  <cit> . on the other hand, chronic activation of platelets is also associated with ms, although their role or the role of the coagulation cascade in this pathology still needs to be clarified  <cit> . a recent proteomic analysis of active ms lesions confirmed the importance of the coagulation cascade, in general, and of thrombin-mediated signaling, in particular, in the inflammatory progression of this disease  <cit> .

clinically, ms is classified into relapsing-remitting , secondary progressive  and primary progressive  subtypes. in 85% of patients who develop definitive ms, onset involves an acute or subacute neurological episode affecting the optic nerves, brainstem or the spinal cord, known as clinically isolated syndrome . studies of the natural history of cis patients are heterogeneous in terms of the clinical presentation and the duration of the follow up, but it is commonly accepted that cis patients are at high risk of developing ms  <cit> .

microparticles  are small vesicles released by a variety of cell types in response to inflammatory mediators  <cit> . these vesicles are able to bind and signal to different cell types through the interaction of proteins exposed in their surface with their cell counter-receptors  <cit> . mps have been proposed as markers of a variety of pathological processes such as endothelial dysfunction  <cit> , systemic lupus erythematosus  <cit> , rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> , stroke  <cit>  and thrombosis  <cit> , but their potential role in the progression of these diseases is not fully characterized. an increase in circulating mps of endothelial origin has been reported in the relapsing phase of patients diagnosed with the rrms form, which suggests a correlation between mps and neurological episodes  <cit> . platelet-derived mps have also been detected in rrms patients  <cit> , but no comparative analysis of mp levels in ms subtypes has been performed to date.

in the present study we present a comprehensive analysis of circulating platelet- and endothelium-derived mps in the plasma of the different clinical forms of ms. compared with normal control subjects, we found a significant and comparable increase in all subtypes, including patients with typical cis and already recovered, or patients in the remission phase of the disease. interestingly, we found experimental evidence to suggest that plasma mps induce human endothelial barrier dysfunction and thus may play an active role in ms progression. rrms mps had a stronger effect than cis or control mps on transendothelial electric resistance , when analyzed at the same concentration. teer is inversely proportional to endothelial monolayer permeability, indicating that mp composition and effect on endothelial barrier differ between ms patients and healthy donors. we also report that ms mps can potentiate the effect on long-term barrier dysfunction of thrombin. our results indicate that mp generation in plasma is an early and permanent consequence of inflammatory demyelinating events.

RESULTS
we investigated mps in platelet-poor plasma  from  <dig> healthy volunteers and  <dig> patients and the possible role of these mps in endothelial barrier function. the characteristics of controls and patients are summarized in table  <dig> table  <dig>

identification of mps of platelet and endothelial origin in human plasma
the ppps from healthy donors and patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to detect circulating vesicles or mps of less than 3 μm diameter . we found mps positive for annexin v, cd42b and cd <dig> , which suggests a platelet origin, and mps positive for annexin v and cd <dig>  but negative for the cd42b marker , which suggest an endothelial origin   <cit> . prior cytometer adjustments using isotype specific controls indicated that the signal from these antibodies was specific . thus, these two types of mps were defined as platelet-derived mps  and endothelial-derived mps . mps positive for the endothelial marker e-selectin/cd62e + were also found, which confirmed the endothelial origin of an mp subset . prior cytometer adjustments using isotype specific controls indicated that the signal from anti e-selectin/cd62e + antibody was specific . hence, emps were identified by detecting the markers cd <dig> and cd <dig>  or cd62e .figure  <dig>

plasma levels of pmps and emps are elevated in patients with cis and all the clinical forms of ms
plasma emps may reflect age-related endothelial dysfunction  <cit> . in the healthy donors included in our study, ranging from  <dig> to 62 years of age, no statistically significant differences in mp number could be attributed to gender or age . this suggests that any change detected in cis and ms patients cannot be attributed to these parameters. next, we performed a comparative analysis of circulating mp levels between these control individuals and patients with cis and all clinical forms of ms. first, the analysis of the pool of all ms patient samples revealed that the mean ± sd of the counts/μl plasma were significantly higher than in healthy controls for the three types of mps analyzed:  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for pmps vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for controls    <dig>  ±  <dig>  emps-cd <dig> vs.  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for controls  , and 746 ±  <dig> for emps-cd62e vs. 418 ±  <dig> for controls  . an elevated mp content was also detected when each clinical form of ms was individually analyzed, including the progressive forms, spms and ppms, which are considered to have a less important inflammatory component . the mp counts  for each form of ms is summarized in table  <dig>  pmps were higher than controls in cis and all the ms forms, but the increase was not statistically significant for cis patients . in addition, remarkable and statistically significantly higher levels of emps-cd <dig> were observed in samples from cis and all ms forms compared to control donors . finally, compared to control subjects, emps-cd <dig> were augmented in cis and all the ms forms, although this increase was statistically significant only for cis patients: 646 ±  <dig> vs. 418 ±  <dig>  . in summary and regarding the absolute values of mp counts, our results show that patients with cis and all the clinical forms of ms have comparable levels of circulating mps in plasma, which are higher than those in healthy individuals .figure  <dig>

mps induce endothelial barrier dysfunction
endothelial barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of ms. to gain insight into the role of circulating mps in ms we compared the effect on endothelial barrier function of mps isolated from patients and healthy controls. we used an electric cell-substrate impedance sensing  system that measures in real time the resistance of endothelial monolayers to a weak electric current that cause no effects on cells. this is called transendothelial electric resistance  and is inversely proportional to the permeability of the monolayer. to address the relevance of mp-mediated teer changes in each endothelial cell type, cells were incubated in parallel with the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor  as a positive control of in vitro barrier disruption   <cit> . first, monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells  were incubated with growing concentrations of mps from healthy donors, cis patients and rrms  patients, the latter taken as paradigm of patients in which the disease has already progressed . control, cis and rr-mps had no significant effects on constitutive teer at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> mp/μl. in contrast, mps from rrms patients notably disrupted the endothelial barrier after 4 h of incubation at  <dig>  mp/μl . these mps decreased normalized teer by  <dig>  ±  <dig> %,  . such decrease was expressed as the percentage of the difference between the teer values obtained from unstimulated huvec monolayers  and the teer values measured in absence of cells . in addition, this decrease was comparable or even stronger than that caused by tnf exposure . in contrast, barrier alterations that control and cis mps induced on endothelial barrier function at  <dig>  mp/ml were clearly below the effect of tnf and were considered minor . consistent with the loss of teer upon exposure to mps from rrms patients, the confocal analysis of endothelial cells incubated with these mps showed the appearance of intercellular gaps, detected by staining of f-actin and the junctional markers ve-cadherin and zo- <dig> . in contrast, intercellular gaps were absent or rare in cells incubated with control and cis mps. these intercellular gaps were measured as the percentage of empty spaces found in different regions of the cell monolayer and increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in cells exposed to control mps to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in cells exposed to rr-mps  . together, these data suggest that mps from rrms patients have composition and signaling properties different to control and cis mps. to confirm this, we tested the effect of rr-mps in a cell model of human endothelium from the blood–brain barrier , the hcmec/d <dig> cells  <cit> . we found no effect of mps on hcmec/d <dig> monolayers at concentrations of  <dig>  and  <dig>  mp/μl . however, barrier disruption caused by rr-mps at  <dig> mp/μl was stronger than that produced by tnf or by control mps at the same concentration . in the presence of rr-mps, resistance decreased by  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , whereas in the presence of  <dig>  mp/μl of control mps, the resistance decreased only by  <dig>  +  <dig> % , which was no statistically significant. 66% of rr-mps had an effect higher than tnf versus only 20% for control mps . in contrast with the effect observed in huvecs, the incubation with rr-mps did not induce big intercellular gaps in hcmec/d <dig> cells, but caused a significant decrease of the immunofluorescence staining of ve-cadherin and zo- <dig> at cell-cell junctions . this was expressed as the junctional index, in which the ratio between the staining intensity at cell borders and the staining at the cell inner area was measured per cell in confluent cell monolayers. this ratio was normalized to  <dig> for hcmec/d <dig> that had not been exposed to mps . junctional index significantly decreased only in the presence of rr-mps. it was reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for ve-cadherin staining and to  <dig>  +  <dig>   for zo- <dig> staining. thus, healthy donors not only have significantly less mps in plasma than ms-patients. at equal concentrations, mps from rrms patients provoke higher disruption of endothelial barrier properties that those from healthy donors.figure  <dig>

the importance of thrombin in the inflammatory progression of experimental ms has recently been shown  <cit> . thrombin is an inflammatory mediator that induces acute barrier contraction and subsequent long-term inflammatory activation of the endothelium  <cit> , so we hypothesized that mps with no apparent effect on endothelial barriers on their own, may sensitize cells to thrombin-mediated barrier disruption. twenty-two hours after the addition of mps, the endothelial responses to thrombin were analyzed in huvecs and hcmec/d <dig> monolayers in which teer had not been previously altered by the initial incubation with mps. whereas huvec monolayers were transiently but completely disrupted by thrombin , we unexpectedly found that the hcmec/d <dig> cell line barely contracted in response to this inflammatory mediator . this suggests that transformed hcmec/d <dig> cells may lack some protein machinery important for a full response to thrombin. we thus studied the effect of mps and thrombin only in huvec barriers. the acute phase of contraction upon thrombin stimulation and the subsequent teer recovery were not affected by the presence of mps in these endothelial cells . however, between  <dig> and 8 h after thrombin stimulation, cells initially exposed to rr-mps at  <dig> mp/μl gradually reduced their barrier integrity. in contrast, the teer decrease between  <dig> and 8 h after thrombin activation was transient and minor in cells previously exposed to control or cis mps . together these data suggest that mps have an effect on endothelial barrier function either on their own, at higher concentrations, or when acting synergistically at lower concentrations with a proinflammatory stimulus, namely thrombin, important for ms progression. together, these data suggest that chronic exposure to mps may contribute to a long-term increase in extravasation of molecules and cells from the bloodstream in ms patients. further investigation into the protein composition of mps from different clinical subtypes may help the design of therapies in which the endothelial permeability increase associated with this inflammatory disease could be prevented.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study we show that the different clinical forms of ms, including the progressive forms, are associated with platelet and endothelial dysfunction, as determined by an increase in the number of circulating platelet- and endothelial cell-derived mps  <cit> . moreover, we demonstrate that these vesicles may play an active role in the progression of the disease by increasing endothelial monolayer permeability.

circulating microparticles as potential markers of cis and ms
different soluble markers have been described for ms in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid . among others, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule - <dig>  and e-selectin  are present in microvesicles derived from endothelial cells during apoptosis or upon inflammatory stimulation  <cit>  and their concentration in plasma may account for the status of the endothelium  <cit> . in our study we observed a remarkable increase in pmps and both emps in all ms clinical forms. the fact that elevated levels of emps in cis patients were also found indicates that these circulating vesicles are a chronic and early feature in patients experiencing proinflammatory demyelinating pathologies. our results extend and are partly consistent with a previous report showing an increase in emps, defined as cd51+ in both the exacerbation and remission phases of rrms patients. interestingly, these authors find no differences in cd31+/cd42b- mps in patients during the remission phase, although they elegantly show that isolated endothelia from patients in both the exacerbation and remission phases of the disease release similar levels of both cd31+ and cd51+ mps to plasma, which are higher than those released by the endothelium of healthy controls  <cit> . collectively and in line with our results, this work indicates that in the remission phase of rrms, high levels of emps can be found. however, mps from the exacerbation and remission phases of the disease probably differ in composition. on the other hand, we have found that plasma pmps were significantly increased in each ms subtype, consistent with the elevated circulating pmps previously found in rrms. these data are also consistent with a pivotal role for platelets in ms  <cit> . pmps were also elevated in cis patients, but this increase was not statistically significant. this suggests that platelet dysfunction may occurs later than the endothelial dysfunction and when the disease is definitively progressing. indeed, platelets have been found in human ms lesions and in the cns of mice in the eae model. platelet depletion in the eae model ameliorated the disease, which was associated with a reduction in recruitment of leukocytes to the cns. similar results were observed after treatment with an anti-cd42b antibody. it is interesting to note that cd42b is present at the pmp surface and therefore the potential role of these vesicles in the progression of the disease needs to be considered.

signals that impair bbb function in ms are initially originated in the central nervous system. it is of note that in the early stages of this pathology, the microglia releases reactive oxygen species, tnf and ifn-γ, all of which can induce mp release  <cit> . therefore, the initial inflammatory foci initiating the progression of the disease may cause the early secretion of emp. in summary, we have observed an increase in circulating emps both in cis and the remitting phase of rrms, suggesting enduring endothelial dysfunction from the very early stages of demyelinating pathologies. these results make pmps and emps good candidates for clinical markers to identify and discriminate between cis and early ms.

circulating microparticles as active players in ms progression
the remarkable ability of mps to induce cell signaling and to promote endothelial dysfunction has already been reported  <cit> . pmps may activate leukocytes and induce their transendothelial migration  <cit> . moreover, mps promote a procoagulant status due to the presence of phosphatidylserine in the outer part of the membrane  <cit> . all this evidence suggests a potential role for mps in the progression of different pathologies, including ms.

the endothelial beds are highly exposed to circulating mps and therefore, more likely to respond to mp-mediated signaling. the data presented here demonstrate that mps alone increase endothelial permeability. moreover, this effect differs between definitive ms, stronger, and cis patient and control donors, which are more attenuated when compared at the same concentration, suggesting differences in the composition of these microvesicles. various mechanisms could mediate the effect of mps on endothelial barrier function. mps expose surface receptors with the potential to regulate endothelial permeability. the marker cd <dig>  used for the identification of emps, can establish homotypic interactions and modulate endothelial permeability  <cit> . emps also regulate the production of reactive oxygen species   <cit> . ros increase causes disruption of the endothelial barriers. on the other hand, mps from microvascular endothelial cells and from atherosclerotic plaques contain matrix metalloproteinases involved in the cleavage and shedding of surface proteins, including that of tnf  <cit> . thus, mps may contribute to the release of cytokines that locally increase permeability. indeed, mps have been shown to act as proinflammatory agents. mps from monocytes contain inflammatory cytokines with the potential to modulate permeability and components of the inflammasome. these mps activate the transcription factor nf-κb and induce the expression of adhesion receptors in the endothelium  <cit> . finally, mps also transport rna and micro  rna, which have the potential to modulate protein expression in the target cell  <cit> . some mirnas, such as mirna <dig> negatively affects bbb function during neuroinflammation  <cit> . hence, the analysis of the different composition of healthy and ms microparticles could reveal novel targets for preventing endothelial barrier disruption during the progression of the disease.

ms is considered to be a chronic inflammatory disease in which several inflammatory mediators play a relevant long-term function in its progression. permanent exposure to these mediators is probably the origin of the mp increase but, importantly, it may also amplify the effect of mps on the endothelium. in the eae model, it has been reported that thrombin inhibition ameliorates the neurological symptoms, indicating a deleterious effect of this mediator in the exacerbation phase  <cit> . in ms, various proteins involved in coagulation, including tissue factor, which activates thrombin, become more abundant in chronic active plaques  <cit> . thrombin is therefore a cytokine at the crossroads of inflammation and coagulation with a remarkable ability to signal to and to alter the barrier properties of endothelial cells, thereby possibly contributing to the progress of ms. our data indicate that preincubation with rr-mps has a long-term effect on the endothelial barrier response to thrombin-mediated challenge, which induces a secondary decrease in teer between  <dig> and 8 h post-stimulation. as mentioned above, mps can deliver proinflammatory molecules. this synergic effect on thrombin-mediated signaling occurs within a time frame compatible with the modulation of the expression of genes related to inflammation and barrier function  <cit>  rather than an effect on acute actomyosin-mediated contraction  <cit> . therefore, ms-mps may alter the vasculature on their own, or potentiate the effects of proinflammatory mediators on endothelial barrier dysfunction. this may have important and unexplored consequences for the progression of ms. further studies are necessary to determine which components of ms-mps are responsible for the observed effects.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that platelet and endothelial functions are altered in the different clinical forms of ms, since patients show an increase in circulating mps of endothelial and platelet origin. in addition, endothelial mps are also significantly increased in cis patients. in vitro, mps from ms patients disrupt endothelial barriers and may thus cooperate in the progression of the disease.
