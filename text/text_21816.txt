BACKGROUND
the bacillus cereus group consists of b. cereus sensu stricto, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus anthracis, bacillus weihenstephanensis, bacillus mycoides, bacillus pseudomycoides and bacillus cytotoxicus, which share close genetic and biochemical relatedness. they have traditionally been classified as different species based on their distinct virulence characteristics or phenotypes
 <cit> , the formers are mostly directly associated with large plasmids. b. anthracis causes the fatal animal and human disease anthrax, genetically determined by its pxo <dig> and pxo <dig> plasmids
 <cit> . similarly, the biopesticidal properties of b. thuringiensis, which distinguish it from b. cereus, are due to large plasmids encoding cry genes
 <cit> . ubiquitous in natural environment and best known as an opportunistic pathogen and food contaminant, b. cereus sensu stricto can cause two distinct forms of food poisoning with symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting. the diarrheal type, generally mild and mostly self-healed, is caused by several potential heat-labile enterotoxins, e.g. hbl, nhe, and cytk, whereas the emetic type, which represents the most serious food safety risk linked to b. cereus, is associated with a heat stable peptide toxin named cereulide. most virulence genes of b. cereus are located on the chromosome
 <cit>  with the exception of the cereulide genetic determinants
 <cit> . b. cytotoxicus is a recently described thermotolerant member of the b. cereus group
 <cit> . the remaining members of the group, b. mycoides, b. pseudomycoides and b. weihenstephanensis, are mainly distinguished on the basis of their morphology  and physiology , respectively
 <cit> , but may also have enteropathogenic potential
 <cit> . in this respect, two b. weihenstephanensis isolates were found to produce a higher amount of cereulide than the reference b. cereus ah <dig> quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry
 <cit> .

cereulide 3) is a small, heat and acid stable cyclic dodecadepsipeptide with a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda
 <cit>  and presents similar characteristics to valinomycin, i.e. chemical structure and toxicology
 <cit> . like valinomycin, cereulide is synthesized enzymatically via non-ribosomal peptide synthetases , and is toxic to mitochondria by acting as a potassium ionophore
 <cit> . it has been reported to inhibit human natural killer cells
 <cit> . indeed, severe and even lethal cases have been reported after the ingestion of food contaminated with high amounts of cereulide
 <cit> .

the cereulide genetic determinants correspond to a cluster of seven nrps genes , which was originally found residing on a large plasmid
 <cit> . this 270 kb element, pcer <dig>  displays similarity to the anthrax virulence pxo <dig> from b. anthracis <cit> . it is a member of pxo1-like plasmids, including pcer <dig>  pper <dig>  pbc <dig> and pbcxo <dig>  which share a highly conserved core region containing genes involved in plasmid replication and its maintenance, sporulation and germination, and a formaldehyde-detoxification locus
 <cit> .

previous studies have shown that enterotoxin production is broadly distributed among different members of the b. cereus group
 <cit>  and also found in other bacillus spp.
 <cit> , whereas emetic toxin formation has been reported to be restricted to a homogeneous group of b. cereus sensu strict <cit> . although seldom, cereulide-producing b. weihenstephanensis strains have also recently been isolated
 <cit> . in order to explore the phylogenetic relationship of the emetic isolates between b. cereus sensu stricto and b. weihenstephanensis, and to analyze the potential mode of genomic transfer of the cereulide genetic determinants, the genetic diversity between b. cereus sensu stricto and b. weihenstephanensis were analyzed in detail.

RESULTS
genome sequences comparison of emetic isolates
the comparison of  <dig> genome sequences including seven emetic  and three non-emetic b. cereus group isolates was performed by gegenees
 <cit> . according to the heatmap , the two emetic b. cereus sensu stricto isolates is <dig> and ah <dig> show a similarity of more than 99%; and the five emetic b. weihenstephanensis isolates show similarities ranging from 86% to 100%, in which the similarity between mc <dig> and mc <dig>  or between cer <dig>  cer <dig> and btb2- <dig>  respectively, is 100%, whereas between mc67/mc <dig> and cer057/btb2-4/cer <dig> is ca. 86%. thus is <dig> and ah <dig> share very similar gene content to form a clade in the phylogenetic tree, so do mc <dig> and mc <dig>  and cer <dig> and cer <dig> and btb2- <dig>  respectively. cer057/btb2-4/cer <dig> is more similar to b. weihenstephanensis kbab <dig> than mc67/mc <dig>  with similarities 94% vs. 86%.

ces 
sequence diversity of the ces gene cluster
all the emetic strains harbor the seven ces genes with the same sizes. the two "cereus" isolates, is <dig> and ah <dig>  only share three nucleotide variances for their cesb gene. for the five "weihenstephanensis" isolates, mc <dig> and mc <dig> from denmark display only one synonymous mutation, in cesa and in cest, respectively, and cer <dig>  cer <dig> and btb2- <dig> from belgium are 100% identical. each ces gene displays 90 ~ 95% identity between b. cereus and b. weihenstephanensis, and 95 ~ 100% identity within b. weihenstephanensis isolates. similar but slightly lower identity levels were observed for the corresponding proteins. thus, based on the concatenated ces genes and protein sequences, two main clusters, namely "cereus" and "weihenstephanensis", could be distinguished, and within "weihenstephanensis" cluster, two subsequent clades were identified .

genomic location of the ces gene clusters
is <dig> harbors a larger plasmid pool than ah <dig>  the cereulide gene cluster of is <dig> was observed to be located on a large plasmid with a size similar to that of pcer <dig>  in ah <dig> . like pcer <dig>  is <dig> was pcr-positive to the pxo <dig> backbone genes pxo1- <dig>  pxo1- <dig>  pxo1- <dig>  pxo1- <dig> and pxo1- <dig>  which all encode hypothetical proteins . it was also observed that the is <dig> contig containing the ces gene cluster is ca.  <dig>  kb with  <dig> predicted cdss, of which  <dig> % matched to those of pcer <dig>  with a good synteny . this indicated that the emetic plasmid in is <dig> is pxo1-like with high similarity to pcer <dig>  the deduced proteins from  <dig> predicted cdss not matching those of pcer <dig> were blasted with databases . the result showed that two matched putative transposases, one was related to putative dna topoisomerases i, one to putative transcriptional repressors, and the others to hypothetical proteins, all with homologs in other b. cereus group plasmids.

for btb2- <dig> and cer <dig>  although large plasmid with smaller size to pcer <dig> was observed in the profile, no hybridization signal was detected . it was observed that the contig containing the ces gene cluster in cer <dig> is about  <dig>  kb with  <dig> predicted cdss, of which 80% and 85% matched those of the chromosomes of ah <dig> and kbab <dig>  respectively. except for the ces genes, the deduced proteins of  <dig> predicted cdss not matching the chromosome of kbab <dig> were compared to protein databases . it was found that four cdss encode putative transposase, acetyltransferase, phage integrase, and phosphoglycolate phosphatase,  <dig> encode hypothetical proteins with chromosomal homologs among b. cereus group strains and four had no hit. the linear alignment showed that the main matches were located in chromosome positions  <dig>  m ~  <dig>  m for ah <dig>  and  <dig>  m ~  <dig>  m for kbab <dig> . thus, it is most likely that the ces gene cluster in cer <dig> has a chromosomal location.

the hybridization bands of mc <dig> and mc <dig> are larger than that of pcer <dig>  although the corresponding plasmid bands are rather weak . this strongly suggests that the cereulide genetic determinants of both mc <dig> and mc <dig>  are located on plasmids larger than pcer <dig>  which were pcr-negative to pxo <dig> backbone genes. unfortunately, the contigs containing the ces gene clusters in mc <dig> and mc <dig> were very short, ca.  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb, respectively. besides the seven ces genes,  <dig> putative cdss were predicted in the larger contig of mc <dig>  of which  <dig> had no hit, and the other  <dig> had homologs in the plasmids or chromosomes of other b. cereus group strains, including putative transposases, spore germination proteins, thiol-activated cytolysin, dehydratase and hypothetical proteins. however, although the gapped genome of mc <dig> was tentatively aligned with all the published plasmid sequences of the b. cereus group using the mauve contig aligner, no obvious colinear match was observed to large fragment .

identification of putative mobile genetic elements  flanking the cereulide genetic determinants
about 5 kb dna sequences upstream of cesh and downstream of cesd from the "ces" contigs were used for detailed analysis. in the case of mc <dig> and mc <dig>  because the available flanking sequences were shorter they were obtained by primer walking.

three types of flanking sequences could be observed . a potential group ii intron, carrying an ncrna and reverse endonuclease gene, is located  <dig>  kb downstream of cesd in the plasmid of both ah <dig> and is <dig>  while an integrase/recombinase gene is located  <dig>  kb downstream of cesd in chromosome of btb2- <dig>  cer <dig> and cer <dig>  no other potential mges were observed in the flanking sequences of cesh of these strains. strikingly, the ces gene cluster of pmc <dig> and pmc <dig> was found to be flanked by two copies of an is element at each end, in opposite orientation , reminiscent of a typical class i composite transposon . this is element  is 853 bp, contains a transposase gene and 16 bp terminal invert repeats  and belongs to the is <dig> family. in addition, an nerd domain or topoisomerase domains, belonging to dna-breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily, were also observed located between isces and cesh and downstream of cesd and isces on pmc <dig> and pmc <dig>  respectively. downstream of the tnces, there is another transposase-encoding orf showing high identity with the upstream ones, but with a shorter size. it is also flanked by the 16 bp ir .

transposition of isces-based composite transposon
in order to test the potential "transposability" of tnces, the ces gene cluster was replaced by a kmr gene marker and a recombinant plasmid ptnkm was created and used for the transposition assay using a well-developed mating-out assay
 <cit> . conjugation between the donor strain e. coli jm <dig>  and the recipient strain hb <dig>  was performed. the average transposition frequency of tnces::km onto r <dig> in three independent experiments was estimated as  <dig>  × 10- <dig> . the final transfer frequency, which is equal to the actual transposition frequency multiplied by the conjugation frequency, was calculated as  <dig>  × 10- <dig> kmrsmr transconjugants per smr recipient.  <dig> transconjugants were randomly screened for ampicilin resistance by disk diffusion assays and all displayed a positive result, indicating the formation of a cointegrate between the host chromosome and ptnkm.

in order to distinguish whether the kmrsmr transconjugants were achieved by transposition or other recombination events leading to plasmid integration, and whether the transposition happened randomly, a southern-blot analysis was performed on nine transconjugants from two independent conjugation experiments that were randomly selected according to the resistance screening and the pcr validation. the hybridization was conducted on the transconjugants ndei-digested genomic dna using an internal bla fragment , isces and km as probes . both hybridizations with the bla and km probes produced a single signal band, the former confirming the formation of a cointegrate of the whole ptnkm into the recipient chromosome. using the isces probes, besides the expected  <dig> and  <dig>  kb bands observed in all the transconjugants, at least one extra band with variable sizes was observed in the nine tested transconjugants, indicating that independent multi-events had occurred at distinct genomic sites .

to detect if the transposition of tnces::km displayed target site biases, the flanking sequences of insertion sites of the transconjugants used in hybridization were determined by primer walking. for three transconjugants, it was found that tnces::km insertions occurred in three distinct sites on plasmid r <dig> and that an 8-bp direct repeat  was produced after transposition , which is a typical feature of is <dig> family members 
 <cit> . for the other six transconjugants, although repeated several times, it is difficult to get the flanking sequences of insertion sites by primer walking, probably due to sequence complexity caused by multiple transposition events of isces.

discussion
the taxonomy of b. cereus group has long been controversial, since many of the species are genetically heterogenous, with the exception of b. anthracis, which is essentially a clone in nature
 <cit> . one of the reasons of this difficulty is that many toxins used for classification are encoded on mges that have hgt potential, e.g. plasmids or transposons
 <cit> . cereulide may cause severe and potential lethal infection during an "emetic" form of b. cereus food poisoning. most emetic b. cereus strains belong to a homogeneous group of b. cereus sensu stricto. although rare, the emetic b. weihenstephanensis strains were recently isolated in nature
 <cit> . furthermore, a heat stable toxin, structural related to cereulide, has also been found in paenibacillus tundra strain
 <cit> . as a consequence, the intra- and inter-species diversity and potential transmission of the cereulide biosynthetic gene cluster is therefore thought provoking.

in this study, the sequence diversity of emetic b. cereus sensu stricto and b. weihenstephanensis was analyzed. since emetic b. cereus sensu stricto had been found to be restricted to a homogeneous group
 <cit> , only two b. cereus sensu stricto isolates were analyzed and compared the other five known b. weihenstephanensis. except for ah <dig>  the unfinished gapped genome sequences of the other emetic isolates were recently submitted
 <cit> . as expected, the two emetic b. cereus sensu stricto isolates share very similar gene content in genome level. furthermore, their "ces" plasmids are quite coherent in terms of synteny, protein similarity and gene content. compared to ah <dig>  is <dig> has a larger plasmid pool, of which the "ces" plasmid is pxo1-like, but the presence of a pxo2-like plasmid was also indicated
 <cit> .

sequence diversity between b. cereus sensu stricto and b. weihenstephanensis or within b. weihenstephanensis was observed. it was also evidenced that the ces cluster had undergone horizontal gene transfer . this could be clued by the fact that the cluster is present in different hosts , which have different chromosomal background, and displays different genomic locations . moreover, another striking indication for hgt was the presence of putative mges in all tested emetic strains.

the composite transposon, tnces, located on large plasmids  in two b. weihenstephanensis strains isolated from soil in denmark was identified. the mobility of tnces was also proved by transposition experiments performed on a tnces-derived element, indicating a hgt potential of the cereulide gene cluster in pmc67/pmc <dig>  although the ces gene cluster is not flanked by is elements in the other two types of emetic isolates, a group ii intron carrying an endonuclease gene in ah <dig> and is <dig>  and a putative integrase/recombinase gene in cer <dig>  cer <dig> and btb2- <dig> were also observed downstream of cesd. both group ii intron and recombinase can potentially be involved in genome dynamics. group ii introns are self-splicing mobile retroelements, some of which have been shown experimentally to be able to invade new dna sites and transfer between species, sometimes accompanied by adjacent sequence deletion or rearrangement
 <cit> . this also relates to previous observations that bacterial group ii introns tend to be located within mobile dna elements such as plasmids, is elements, transposons or pathogenicity islands , which could account for their spread among bacteria
 <cit> .

based on our results, it is reasonable to suggest that mges have played a key role in the transmission of the cereulide gene cluster. in many cases, plasmids encode passenger genes originated via hgt that generally confer adaptive functions to the host cell, the classic example being antibiotic resistance genes. for instance, the nrps gene cluster responsible for the production of β-lactam antibiotics  was proved to be transmitted by hgt from bacteria to bacteria and from bacteria to fungi
 <cit> . this is also the general mode for toxin evolution
 <cit> . in contrast, as a natural analog, a recent study reported that a vertical transmission  origin rather than a hgt for the vlm gene cluster in streptomyces spp. although there is a significant structure and toxicology similarity between valinomycin and cereulide and an organizational similarity between the vlm gene cluster and the ces gene cluster, they are highly divergent from each other at the dna level
 <cit> . they may also have quite different evolution history.

the conjugative and transfer promoting capacities of the emetic plasmids were also assessed by bi- and tri-parental matings, respectively. none were indicative of self-conjugative or mobilizable activities, at least under the conditions used in the assay  . yet, the emetic strains can host the conjugative plasmid pxo <dig>  which could be transferred from its native b. thuringiensis sv. israelensis to the emetic strains and, subsequently from the emetic strains to the original b. thuringiensis sv. israelensis host
 <cit> .

an important concern arising from this study is that the cereulide gene cluster may have the potential to be transmitted by transposition and, therefore, if the emetic strain can randomly encounter the conjugative plasmid pxo <dig> in nature, transposition of the cereulide gene cluster into pxo <dig> might happen at a low frequency, and as a consequence the resulting emetic pxo <dig>  crossing boundaries within the b. cereus group by conjugation, could pose a serious public health issue.

CONCLUSIONS
emetic b. cereus group isolates display more variations than originally thought. the cereulide biosynthesis gene cluster was present in different hosts , which have different chromosomal background and display different genomic locations . the sequences of cereulide genetic determinants are diverse and coevolved with the host. three types of mges were identified in the flanking sequences of the cereulide biosynthesis gene cluster, of which the transposition capacity of a resistant derivative of the composite transposon tnces in e. coli was demonstrated. further study is needed to look for appropriate genetic tools to analysis the transposition of tnces in bacillus spp. and the dynamics of other mges flanking the ces gene clusters.
