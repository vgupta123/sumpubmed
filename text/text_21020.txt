BACKGROUND
the rat genome  <cit>  was the third mammalian genome to be sequenced, after the human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit>  genomes. the rat is one of the most widely used model organisms in biological research. despite this fact, the annotated proteins are fewer for rat  compared to mouse  and human    <cit> . automated protein predictions offer fast annotation but they are error-prone and need to be followed up by careful manual curation. for instance the genscan gene prediction program has a sensitivity and specificity of about 90% for detecting exons, leading to frequent errors in multi-exon genes  <cit> . our recent annotation of the chicken g protein-coupled receptors  showed that over 60% of the chicken genscan gene predictions with a human orthologue needed curation. the curation drastically increased the quality of the dataset as the average percentage identity between the human-chicken one-to-one orthologous pairs was raised from 56% to 73%  <cit> . moreover, automated annotation based on inter-species comparisons has difficulties in identifying species-specific proteins, a problem that is relevant especially to large protein families that display large differences between species. for example previous reports of the v1r and v2r vomeronasal receptor repertoires display a very large variation in numbers  <cit> . the degrees of completeness and accuracy of protein annotations have, of course, a substantial impact on subsequent analyses such as phylogenetic analyses and calculations of evolutionary distances. accurate comparisons of the rat and human proteins, such as correct assignment of orthologous pairs, are crucial for the design and interpretation of physiological and pharmacological studies in which results are inferred between the species.

the superfamily of gpcrs is one of the largest groups of proteins within most mammals. gpcrs are signal mediators that have a prominent role in most major physiological processes at both the central and peripheral level  <cit> . it has been estimated that about 80% of all known hormones and neurotransmitters activate cellular signal transduction mechanisms via gpcrs  <cit> . the key common structural components of the gpcrs are the seven transmembrane α-helices that span the cell membrane. it has been estimated that gpcrs represent between 30–45% of the current drug targets  <cit> . however, drugs have only been developed for a very small number of the gpcrs and the potential for further drug discovery within this field is enormous.

the human gpcr repertoire has previously been divided into five main families ; glutamate , rhodopsin , adhesion , frizzled/taste <dig> and secretin   <cit> . the grafs families are found in all bilateral species and it has thus been suggested that they arose before the split of nematodes from the chordate lineage  <cit> . the largest family is by far the rhodopsin family, one reason being that it includes the many olfactory receptors . most of the gpcr drug targets, mainly amine and peptide receptors, are found within this family  <cit> . in humans, the second largest family is the adhesion family. most of the receptors in this family are still orphans   <cit> . the glutamate family includes receptors that bind to glutamate, gaba and calcium as well as the groups of sweet and umami taste receptors  and vomeronasal receptors type  <dig>  that are binding native exogenous compounds. the secretins bind large peptides such as secretin, parathyroid hormone, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide, calcitonin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, growth hormone releasing hormone and pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating protein. the frizzled receptors bind among others the wnt ligand and play an important role in embryonic development. the vomeronasal receptors type  <dig>  and taste receptor type  <dig>  gpcr families are involved in pheromone recognition and bitter taste sensing, respectively. moreover, there are gene sequences that have been suggested to represent additional gpcrs but show only weak or no sequence similarity to any of the main gpcr families.

here we provide the first overall map of the gpcr subset of the rat genome. we have made extensive efforts to mine the gpcr repertoire and cover all gpcr families comprising a total of  <dig>  gene sequences. in addition we have also updated the human and the mouse repertoires. we have performed phylogenetic analyses of the rat, human and mouse gpcr families and provide detailed information of their orthologous relationships.

RESULTS
the overall gpcr repertoires in rat, mouse and human
in this analysis we present the overall repertoire of gpcrs in rats and updated versions of the gpcr repertoires in humans and mice. the gpcr families found in humans, grafs, have been slightly updated since they were last described by our group, but the mouse datasets are nearly identical  <cit> . the main difference is that in this analysis the vomeronasal <dig> family and the olfactory receptor  group are included and the frizzled and taste <dig> receptors are considered as two separate families. throughout this article the gpcr families are written in italics; adhesion, frizzled, glutamate, rhodopsin, secretin, taste <dig> and vomeronasal <dig>  whereas the names of family subgroups are abbreviated e.g. v2r  and or . our classification of the gpcr families is based strictly on sequence homology. this analysis also includes  <dig> gene sequences that have been suggested to encode gpcrs but do not belong to any of the gpcr families . these are referred to as "other gpcrs" or just "others". the numbers of gpcr genes in the different families and species are given in table  <dig> and the names of the receptors in each family and species is listed in a separate spreadsheet . in table  <dig>  the gpcr genes have been categorised as "full-length", "pseudogenes" or "partial" and the numbers of new genes are also indicated. full-length gpcr genes contain an intact transmembrane domain and are likely to encode functional receptor proteins. the pseudogenes are non-functional genes that have been frame-shifted due to additions or deletions of nucleotides or truncated by missense mutations introducing stop codons. the "partial" genes are missing parts of their sequence due to incomplete information in the respective genome assembly and in sequence databases. gpcr gene sequences were defined as new if they had not been annotated as gpcrs in genbank and did not exist in any of the supplementary datasets linked to previous studies. the gpcr repertoires in the rodents are more than twice as large as that in humans, and rats have more gpcrs than mice. this is mainly explained by the large differences in the number of ors, but a substantial part of the human-rodent differences is because of the vomeronasal receptors, vomeronasal1s and v2rs . there are no partial human gpcr genes,  <dig> in mice and  <dig>  in rats. these figures reflect the completeness of the respective genome assemblies which must now all be considered fairly complete. most  of the partial rat sequences are or genes. these are difficult to assemble due to their large numbers, high sequence similarity and genomic proximity. in this respect this analysis shows an important difference as compared with for example the initial work on mouse by vassilatis and colleagues  <cit> , which contained large numbers of partial sequences. our sequence datasets  have, in all instances possible, been carefully compared to previously published datasets .

the human, rat and mouse gpcr families; their numbers of full-length, pseudogene and partial members; as well as the number of new members identified in this study. gpcr gene sequences were defined as new if their sequence was not available in a public database annotated as a gpcr. *no figure could not be calculated.

phylogenetic analyses
we produced phylogenetic trees for each gpcr family. these are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and as additional files of this article , which all also hold pie charts of the proportions of orthologous and species-specific gpcrs in the three species analysed. the mouse glutamate, rhodopsin , adhesion, frizzled and secretin gpcrs are not included in these trees since they have been described before in relation to the human repertoires  <cit> , and the exact orthologous and paralogous relationships are viewed in a table listing the receptors in the three species studied . all receptors sequences were trimmed prior to the phylogenetic analysis to isolate the transmembrane domains which are the regions that are conserved throughout the gpcr families. a special approach was used for the phylogenetic analysis of the rhodopsin family which is very challenging because of its size and diversity. some rhodopsin gpcrs have diverged to the extent that their relationships to the rest of the family members cannot be determined. these receptor sequences do not show stable tree topology and group with different subfamilies when using different phylogenetic algorithms. the ambiguous grouping of these receptors is also illustrated by the fact that when their sequences are searched against the whole dataset using blast the best matches  to these receptors belong to different subfamilies. we minimised the above problems by separating the receptors with a low sequence identity from the main part of the dataset when performing phylogenetic analyses. this was done by applying iteratively higher thresholds of percentage sequence identity on the dataset until a stable tree topology could be obtained.

the rhodopsin family
the phylogenetic tree of the rhodopsin family in human and rat is shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  the majority of the rhodopsins are in figure  <dig>  whereas other members with ambiguous relationships are shown in figure  <dig> as separate groups, pairs and singles in the order of falling sequence identity . sequences defined by the same percentage of sequence identity are grouped in boxes with the threshold value given in the lower right corner. in figure  <dig> the α-δgroups, previously defined by our group  <cit>  were reproduced and they contain most of the receptors from the original analysis. 79% of the human and rat rhodopsins are found in one-to-one orthologous pairs.

rhodopsin family species variation
several of the rhodopsin family gpcrs show interesting species variation. most of the species-specific rhodopsins are found among the mas-related gpcrs , trace-amine-associated receptors  and "formyl peptide receptor-like"  receptors. the group of mrgs are located primarily in sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglion and are implicated in perception of pain  <cit> . the numbers of mrgs  are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in human, rat and mouse, respectively. there are  <dig> rat-human orthologous pairs of mrg receptors. the taars  are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in human, mouse and rat, respectively  <cit> . the fprls  fprrs <dig>  fprrs <dig>  fprrs <dig> and fprrs <dig> are rat specific, whereas fprl <dig> is only found in humans. the remaining species-specific rhodopsins are singles  derived from a single gene duplication or gene loss in either the primate or rodent lineage. these are: 5-ht1e and 5-ht5b serotonin receptors ; gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor  <dig> , gpr <dig>  pgr15l, thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor  <dig>  and the motilin receptor  ; mchr <dig> and npbwr <dig> ; gpr <dig> and gpr <dig> ; agtr1b and rln3r <dig> ; p2ry <dig>  gpr <dig>  oxer <dig>  gpr109b, gpr <dig>  p2ry <dig>  p2ry10p <dig> ; cxcr <dig>  and ccr1l <dig> ; gpr103b ; opn1mw ; gpr <dig>  lgr <dig> ; gpr141b ; gpr166p  and gpr <dig> .

rhodopsin family ligand types and orphan receptors
the colour coding of figure  <dig> and  <dig> gives an overview of the types of ligands or bound proteins for the rhodopsin family receptors. there are  <dig> peptide ,  <dig> lipid ,  <dig> amine ,  <dig> purine  -binding human rhodopsins and also  <dig> opsin receptors that are by light . one receptor, gpr <dig> has a dual ligand specificity for purine and lipid molecules  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> rhodopsins  are scattered in smaller groups of ligand types including protease-activated , glycoprotein hormone , metabolite , amino acid  and steroid hormone . moreover, we found that there are  <dig> human orphan rhodopsins, of which  <dig> have orthologues in rats.  <dig> of the human orphan rhodopsins are grouped in the phylogenetic tree of the majority of the receptors , whereas  <dig> have more atypical sequence and are found in smaller groups, pairs or are singles .  <dig> of the human orphan rhodopsins could not be grouped with any characterized receptor making ligand prediction difficult. additional information about the phylogenetic grouping of ligand types and orphan receptors was presented in a recent study by surgand et al  <cit> .

the glutamate, adhesion, frizzled, secretin and taste <dig> families
the glutamate   and secretin  families have a completely conserved number of members between rats, mice and human and they are all one-to-one orthologues. gpcrs belonging to the glutamate family have been shown to form functional heterodimers or homodimers. the gabab receptor is formed by heterodimerization between one gabab <dig> subunit and one gabab <dig> subunit, the sweet taste receptor is formed by heterodimerization between the t1r <dig> subunit and the t1r <dig> subunit, whereas the umami taste receptor is formed by heterodimerization between the t1r <dig> subunit and the t1r <dig> subunit. additional gpcrs within the secretin family are formed by heterodimerization between a gpcr and an accessory protein  <cit> . in the frizzled family  one rat member, fzd <dig>  is a pseudogene. two adhesions , emr <dig> and emr <dig>  were previously shown to be missing in mice  <cit>  and these are also missing in the rat genome. moreover, we now found that the rat and mouse gene sequences of gpr <dig> contain stop codons within the transmembrane region and are thus pseudogenes. we recently reported on two new human pseudogenes of the adhesion family, both similar to gpr <dig>  <cit>  and these have now received official names from hugos gene nomenclature committee and are now referred to as gpr116p <dig> and gpr116p <dig>  respectively. the rodent and human taste <dig> families  have a low proportion of one-to-one orthologous pairs. among the  <dig> rat,  <dig> mouse and  <dig> human receptors, there are only  <dig> orthologous triplets . these represent 20% of all members, whereas in rats and mice, 91% of the taste2s make up one-to-one orthologous pairs. the number of taste2s in our datasets is equal or close to previously reported numbers  <cit> . the rat receptors t2r <dig> and t2r <dig>  <cit>  are not available in any public sequence database.

the vomeronasal <dig> receptor family
five full-length vomeronasal <dig> genes, vn1r1- <dig>  have been previously identified from sequence mining in the human genome assembly  <cit> . we removed vn1r <dig> from this list because it contains a frame shift in the current genome assembly, but we found a new intact human vomeronasal <dig>  fksg <dig>  the number of human vomeronasal <dig> pseudogenes was first estimated at  <dig>  <cit> , but this number was later reduced to  <dig>  <cit>  and in this study we found only  <dig>  we found  <dig> full-length genes and  <dig> vomeronasal <dig> pseudogenes in the mouse genome and  <dig> full-length genes and  <dig> pseudogenes in the rat genome. these numbers are within the ranges of previously reported figures which are 137– <dig> full-length and 156– <dig> pseudogenes for mouse and 95– <dig> full-length and 21– <dig> pseudogenes for rat  <cit> . we found many non-vomeronasal1s and duplicates within the datasets from young et. al.  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree of the vomeronasal <dig> family was produced . only 9% of the rat-mouse receptors are one-to-one orthologues and there are no human-rat one-to-one orthologues.

the vomeronasal type  <dig> receptors 
the human v2r repertoire has not been mined in our previous whole genome gpcr repertoire articles and here we identified  <dig> full-length gene and  <dig> pseudogenes. moreover, we almost doubled the number of reported intact v2rs in rat  and mouse  and raised the total numbers of receptors considerably   <cit> . our phylogenetic tree of the v2rs is available as an additional file . there are no human-rat orthologues in this receptor group and only 2% of the rodent v2rs are orthologues.

the olfactory receptors 
the olfactory receptors make up half or more of all gpcrs in mammalian species  and they constitute  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genes in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively . our search for human ors identified all  of the full-length genes and 96% of the pseudogenes in the horde database  <cit> , and in addition we found  <dig> new pseudogenes. this shows that the sensitivity and specificity of our searches was high. we identified  <dig> full-length or genes and  <dig> or pseudogenes in the mouse genome which is close to what was reported in a recent analysis which resulted in  <dig> full-length genes and  <dig> pseudogenes  <cit> . we found  <dig> ors  in the rat genome. the rat therefore has at least  <dig>  more full-length or genes and  <dig>  more or pseudogenes than mice and  <dig>  more full-length or genes and  <dig>  more or pseudogenes than humans. the percentages of pseudogenes are 23% in mouse, 31% in rats and 55% in humans. an or phylogenetic tree with pie charts of the proportions of orthologues and the large tree file in newick format were produced . 8%  of the rat and human ors are orthologous, 18%  are human specific and 74%  are rat specific. of the mouse and rat ors 31%  are orthologous, 30%  are mouse specific and 38%  are rat specific.

"other gpcrs"
the additional sequences suggested by various sources to be gpcrs, here called "other gpcrs" or just "others", are shown in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> pairs  and  <dig> triplets  of homologues within this set. no additional sequences related to these have been found in the human, mouse and rat genomes except for the paqrs that have additional homologues, but these are not suggested to be gpcrs  <cit> . thus the "others"  seem to make up protein families of their own comprising only 1– <dig> members. gpr <dig>  is the only one in this list that has been shown to be able to activate a g protein  <cit> . for paqr <dig> different reports describe either plasma membrane or intracellular location  <cit> . paqr <dig> gpr <dig> , gpr181p  and gpr <dig> have vague and ambiguous sequence similarities to several different gpcrs families. gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr137b and gpr137c show low similarity to various membrane bound proteins. only gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr181p and gpr <dig> show a higher similarity to membrane proteins than other proteins and  <dig> others are indicated to have more or less than  <dig> transmembrane regions. some sequences suggested to be gpcrs have later been shown to be members of other membrane protein families. we found one such example when searching in the non-redundant database for alternative versions of putative gpcr sequences. a protein  recently discovered by searches utilising hidden markov models and suggested to be a gpcr  <cit>  is a sugar transporter, myl5/mfsd <dig>  comprising  <dig> transmembrane helices. two additional human gpcr sequences from the same study have now received gpr names, gpr <dig> and gpr <dig>  by hgnc upon our request and are found among the others in table  <dig> 

"other gpcrs"; sequences that have been suggested to be gpcrs but are not members of any gpcr family. the searches for transmembrane helices were made using tmhmm version  <dig>   <cit> . conserved domains were searched for using conserved domain search  <cit>  with a cut-off at e =  <dig> . the blast searches for the most similar proteins were performed in the refseq database using a cut-off at e =  <dig> .

discussion
here we present the first overall analysis of the gpcr subset of the rat genome and we provide updated versions of the human and mouse gpcr repertoires.  <dig>  of the full-length rat gpcrs had not been previously annotated and we also identified  <dig> new mouse receptors and  <dig> new human receptor. of the new receptors in this study, 93% are ors and 6% are vomeronasal receptors. we have performed comprehensive sequence mining and our datasets have been carefully compared with previously available versions. the gpcr gene sequences have been verified for a complete and non-interrupted coding region and incorrectly predicted sequences have been manually curated. we also performed phylogenetic analyses displaying for the first time the detailed orthologous relationships of the gpcr repertoires in rats, mice and humans. this information is valuable when results from pharmacological and physiological studies are compared or extrapolated between species.

the authors of the draft rat genome assembly estimated the proportion of one-to-one orthologues to be 89–90% between the rat and human genomes and 86–94% between the rat and mouse genomes  <cit> . the average amino acid sequence identities of the orthologues were reported to be  <dig> % for rat and human and  <dig> % for rat and mouse. remarkably, we find that the average proportion of one-to-one orthologues within the gpcr superfamily is much lower. the average proportions of such orthologues were only 58% for the rat and human, and 70% for the rat and mouse gpcr repertoires. the average protein sequence identities of the gpcr orthologue pairs is also lower than for the whole genomes. we found these to be 80% for the rat and human pairs and 90% for the rat and mouse pairs. this suggests that the gpcr superfamily is much more divergent than the protein families in the genome in general. however, this difference in the proportions and sequence identities of orthologues may not entirely be explained by the relatively high divergence of the gpcr superfamily. this is also related to the fact that we have mined and edited the sequences to a much more complete level than the sequence data from the original draft rat genome assembly.

there are very different levels of evolutionary conservation or orthologous pairing of the gpcr families. there are families in which all  and secretin families) or almost all  receptors are conserved between the compared species. other families have expanded separately in the three species  or expanded in one lineage while vanishing  in another. there are also remarkable examples of family subgroups that have all expanded in the rodents while diminishing in primates , trace-amine-associated receptors , mas-related gpcrs , formyl peptide receptor like receptors  and vomeronasal type  <dig> receptors ). it is notable that all the large inter-species variations are found among the families and subgroups that respond to exogenous stimuli. thus these differences are likely to make important contributions to the diversification of the senses of olfaction, taste and pheromone sensation among the species. the pheromone sensation has evolved in rats and mice, which have many species-specific vomeronasal receptors , but disappeared in the primate lineage in which the vomeronasal organ is regressed in adults and critical components of vomeronasal transduction pathway have been lost  <cit> . moreover, it has recently been shown that the taars may act as chemosensory receptors in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> .

there is a considerable variation among the different families and groups of gpcrs in the percentage of amino acid identity of orthologues. the rat and human frizzled family orthologues have 95% average sequence identity while the lowest percentage identity between rats and human orthologous pairs is found in the taste <dig> family . the taste <dig> family also display a very high divergence with respect to the repertoire. only 20% of the rat and human and 84% of the rat and mouse receptors are one-to-one orthologues, indicating that this family is evolving rapidly. the taste <dig> receptors mediate the sense of bitter taste  <cit>  and it is likely that their divergence has contributed to the different capacities of species to recognise bitter tastants. also the adhesion family gpcrs display relatively low amino acid identity between rat, mouse and human orthologues . however, in contrast to the taste <dig> family, the adhesion family repertoire is relatively well conserved; 100% of the rat and mouse and 91% of the rat and human adhesions make up one-to-one orthologous pairs. the fact that the adhesions have been retained during evolution shows that they have important physiological functions and their relatively low sequence conservation indicate that their action is less dependent on the transmembrane region. this is in agreement with the hypothesis that the transmembrane regions of the adhesion gpcrs may perhaps not be involved in direct interactions with ligands or g-proteins but have an important role as membrane anchors  <cit> .

the human ors have previously been divided into class i and class ii based on phylogenetic criteria  <cit> . the human genome contains  <dig>  class i and  <dig>  class ii ors and our analysis shows that the rat genome includes  <dig>  class i ors and  <dig>  class ii. class i ors mediate the effect of water-soluble odorants and class ii receptors recognise airborne odorants  <cit> . the proportion of rat and mouse or orthologues is relatively low  and the proportion of rat and human or orthologues is very low . species-specific receptors can be found in most parts of the phylogenetic tree, but there are also several large clusters of species-specific ors . there are five large clusters containing exclusively rat-specific ors. these are located closest to the human or1f , or1i <dig> , or7a <dig> , <dig> , or2ak <dig> , or2b <dig>  . many human-specific ors were found in the or2t-group which contains  <dig> human ors  without a rodent orthologue. these species-specific clusters include receptors exclusively belonging to class ii suggesting that this differentiation between the species has contributed to the unique capacities to recognise volatile airborne substances.

it is difficult to envision why in some cases several species lack a certain receptor while the same receptor has been retained during evolution in other lineages/species. one of the most likely explanations is that the gene has been lost because another gene has taken over its functions. one example of this could be the motilin receptor, mlnr. we did not find orthologues to this human receptor in neither rat nor mouse. in further searches  we did however, find orthologues for this receptor in chimps , cow, chicken, zebrafish and pufferfish  but not in dogs, suggesting that this receptor has been specifically lost in several mammals. mlnr is most closest related to the ghrelin receptor, ghsr  and these receptors have  <dig> % overall protein sequence identity. motilin stimulates gastrointestinal motility and this function is modulated by a pharmaceutical substance, erythromycin a, which mimics this peptide and targets the mlnr receptor  <cit> . it has been shown that the ghrelin peptide with its receptor regulates gastrointestinal motility in rodents and the expression of ghsr in the human gastrointestinal tract indicates that ghrelin plays a role in gastrointestinal motility in humans as well  <cit> . it is thus possible that the ghrelin system plays a compensating role in gi motility in species that are missing the motilin receptor, such as rodents and dogs.

there are several additional cases in which two rhodopsin family receptors have the same ligand and could share functions in some species while one of the receptors has been lost in several other evolutionary lineages such that the other gene may have taken over. trhr and trhr <dig> both bind to thyrotropin-releasing hormone . the former receptor has been conserved throughout all searched vertebrate genomes whereas trhr <dig> is lacking in primates, chicken and fugu suggesting that it has been lost independently in three lineages. furthermore the neuropeptide b/w receptors  have a  <dig> % overall sequence identity in human. we found both npbwr <dig> and npbwr <dig> in fish but whereas npbwr <dig> has been retained in the examined vertebrate species npbwr <dig> is found neither in the dog nor the chicken genomes and has become a pseudogene in the rodent lineage. another similar case is seen for the melanin-concentrating hormone receptors mchr <dig> and mchr <dig>  we could find both receptor subtypes in fish but whereas the former has been conserved the latter, mchr <dig>  is absent or is a pseudogene in rat, mouse, hamster, guinea pig and chicken  <cit> . this is illustrated also for another rhodopsin family receptor, oxer <dig>  which is missing in the rodents and in chicken but is conserved in fish, primates, cow and dog . for this receptor there exists no characterized homologue that binds the same ligand  but there are several closely related orphan receptors such as gpr <dig>  gpr <dig>  gpr109a and gpr109b  that could tentatively be activated by the same ligand.

in summary, we have presented the overall gpcr repertoire of rats and analysed it in relation to updated datasets for human and mouse. we have identified new genes, made extensive comparisons to previously published datasets and performed phylogenetic analyses to distinguish orthologous and species-specific receptors. this material is important for the interpretation of studies in which results are extrapolated between species to provide information about receptor structure or native ligand.

CONCLUSIONS
we present the first overall analysis of the gpcr repertoire in rats and compare this to versions of those in mouse and human. the receptor sequences have been manually curated to assure a higher level of completeness and quality. the detailed relationships of the repertoires, here determined by careful phylogenetic analyses, are valuable information when results from pharmacological and physiological studies are compared or extrapolated between species. the greatest diversification, with regard to both receptor numbers and sequences, is seen for those gpcrs that respond to exogenous stimuli indicating that the alteration of the repertoires of these receptors has been important for adaptation of the species to their environment. our detailed comparison of gpcr repertoires also revealed several examples of species-specific expansions and deletions. we performed an extended analysis in additional species of several rhodopsins that were shown to have been lost in different lineages but retained in others, investigating if their function might be shared with another  receptor. most rhodopsin family gpcrs that bind the same type of ligands, e.g. lipids and peptides, formed coherent groups in our phylogenetic analysis. however, many  of the human orphan rhodopsins could not be grouped with any characterized receptor because of low sequence identity and/or ambiguous relationships making the prediction of the ligand difficult. we found the number of human orphan rhodopsin receptors to be  <dig> while the number was  <dig> in  <dig>  <cit>  suggesting that the current rate of de-orphanization is higher than that for the discovery of members of this family.
