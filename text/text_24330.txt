BACKGROUND
bemisia tabaci, the sweet potato whitefly, causes millions of dollars of crop damage globally  <cit>  and is considered one of the world’s top  <dig> invasive species according to the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources  . it is capable of causing extensive damage to major vegetable, grain legume and fiber crops and regarded as a regulated species by a number of countries or regions, e.g., australia, africa, china, the eu, and the usa. there are two main types of damage caused by b. tabaci; the first is caused by immature and adult stages feeding . the second type is indirect damage from excretion of honeydew onto the surfaces of leaves and fruit and this promotes the growth of sooty mold fungi which uses honey dew as a substrate and colonizes contaminated surfaces, further interfering with photosynthesis, ultimately resulting in reduced quality of fruit and fiber  <cit> . in addition, b. tabaci is the vector of many economically important plant viral-pathogens, most being begomoviruses ; a group recognized as the most important emerging plant virus group in subtropical and tropical world regions  <cit> .

b. tabaci is now known as a species complex with dozens of morphologically indistinguishable species and contains both invasive and native members  <cit> . in  <dig>  the first global mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase i  dataset for b. tabaci was used to reconstruct the global phylogenetic relationships, indicating significant variation between and within genetic groups  <cit> . since that pivotal work in  <dig>  b. tabaci has been shown to be a species complex with at least  <dig> distinct genetic groups identified based on mtcoi  <cit> . what is more, by matching museum syntypes from the  <dig> original specimen from gennadius using mtcoi molecular maker, med were recognized as the type species of the b. tabaci complex  <cit> . with the taxonomy of the b. tabaci species complex becoming clearer, it is now possible to use this information to carry out detailed comparative studies. this includes uncovering and comparing the mitochondrial genomes  of the different species in the b. tabaci complex. thao et al.  sequenced the mitogenomes of six whitefly species and found that four of them had an rearrangement of the cox <dig> - nd <dig> region compared to the hypothesized ancestral insect mitochondrial gene order  <cit> . they suggest, based on this rearrangement that this region has been transposed, at least four times in the evolution of whiteflies. however, whether the gene order of mitogenome in other b. tabaci species, especially the invasive med and meam <dig>  differs from the ancestral whitefly mitogenome is still unknown. furthermore, in the b. tabaci species complex, only the mitogenome of new world species is available  <cit> , a detailed comparison of mitogenomes between members of the b. tabaci species complex is still lacking. in this study, we decided to explore variation in the mitogenomes of the b. tabaci species complex. this study will also add to the growing literature on insect comparative mitogenomics of closely related species  <cit> .

in addition to using the mitogenome for evolutionary study, we are also interested in the function of the mitochondrial genes. the mitochondrion is an important organelle responsible for numerous important cellular functions in insects such as energy transduction, apoptosis, detoxification, signal transduction and atp production  <cit> . with few exceptions, insect mitogenomes contain  <dig> genes encoding  <dig> protein coding genes ,  <dig> ribosomal rnas  and  <dig> transfer rnas   <cit> . the gene organization of mitogenomes is different between insects  <cit>  and mechanisms of mitochondrial gene expression have been investigated in various organisms  <cit> . studying the mitochondrial gene organization and expression may facilitate the elucidation of mitogenome evolution and characterization of key components regulating insect biology  <cit> . at present, large amount of information about mitochondrial expression profile has focused on studies of humans, mice or drosophila <cit> . relatively little is known about the features of non-model insect mitogenomes, such as polyadenylation and modes of gene transcription  <cit> .

next-generation sequencing  data is important to predict processed mitochondrial transcripts and reveal transcription process in mitogenomes  <cit> . for example, the transcription profile of genes encoded in the mitogenome of drosophila and the legume pod borer maruca vitrata has been revealed using ngs data  <cit> . for b. tabaci, the transcriptome of med has been sequenced and a total of  <dig> million reads were obtained  <cit> . a large number of sequencing reads could be mapped to the mitogenome of the new world b. tabaci species . therefore, a second goal of this study is to utilize ngs data to analyzing the characteristics of whitefly mitochondrial gene expression, including the translation start site of pcgs, polyadenylation and polycistronic transcripts.

RESULTS
obtaining the med mitogenome sequences with the ngs data
without prior amplification of specific regions of the mitogenome, dna sequence data obtained by ngs methodology can generate sequences of the mitogenome  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> million illumina sequencing reads of med  <cit>  were used to retrieve the med mitogenome sequences by mapping them to the available mitogenome of b. tabaci new world species . a total of  <dig>  reads were mapped to the new world species reference mitogenome. these reads were assembled into eight contigs distributed in different parts of the new world mitogenome . the missing base positions were 1– <dig>  624– <dig>  2042– <dig>  2237– <dig>  7523– <dig>  11209– <dig>  11537– <dig> and 13566– <dig>  specific primers were then designed to close these gaps .

the med mitogenome
the complete mitogenome of med is  <dig>  bp and encodes the  <dig> genes , found in most metazoan mitogenomes   <cit> . the med mitogenome also includes  <dig> non-coding portions , which are at least  <dig> bps long. two pairs of genes  are located on the same strand and overlap by  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, which is a common feature of insect mitochondrial dna  <cit> . the other genes are contiguous or separated by a few nucleotides or intergenic spacers . the entire complement of  <dig> trnas ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> bp was found and most of the trnas can be folded as classic clover-leaf structures except trna-serucu that is missing the dihydorouridine  arm as in most metazoan. compared to the new world mitogenome , there is a slight expansion of med  due to an insertion of repeat sequences in the a + t-rich region. in addition, the mitogenome of med has the same gene order as that of new world species, which differs from the gene order of postulated whitefly ancestor  <cit> .

sequence divergence between mitogenoms of the med and new world b. tabaci species
an earlier study of the whitefly mitogenomes focused on the gene arrangement in the new world species  <cit> . to understand the divergence and evolution of b. tabaci mitogenomes, the differences between med and new world mitogenomes  were analyzed in detail. for the  <dig> pcgs, the overall divergence between med and new world is  <dig> %, which is higher than the divergence of cox <dig> sequences  which was used to define the b. tabaci species limits  <cit> . the nucleotide sites in pcgs were further classified into nondegenerate   and fourfold degenerate sites  . the 4d sites within pcgs are free from selective constraints and can provide data for inferring evolutionary distance  <cit> . from a total of  <dig>  bp of pcgs,  <dig>  bp are nd sites, whereas  <dig>  bp are 4d sites . at 4d sites the overall divergence is  <dig> %, whereas the overall divergence at nd sites is only  <dig> %. at nd sites, the divergence at non-cpg sites and cpg sites are comparable between mitogenomes of the med and new world species. however, at 4d sites, the divergence of cpg sites  is  <dig> times of that at the non-cpg sites . these results demonstrate that the higher percentage of divergence at the 4d sites is proportional to both the content of cpg sites and the rate of mutation .

the value of ka/ks ratios can be used as an indicator of selective pressure acting on a pcg  <cit> . to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on pcgs, the rate of non-synonymous substitutions , synonymous substitutions  and the ratio of ka/ks were estimated for each pcg between the med and new world mitogenomes . among the  <dig> pairs of pcgs, the ka/ks ratio of atp <dig> was the highest , indicating that atp <dig> has been evolving under high selection pressure and has the potential value for studying the inherit diversity of different b. tabaci populations within a species  <cit> . cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  cytb, cox <dig> and nd <dig> showed the lowest ka/ks values , suggesting that those genes are under high purifying selection.

codon usage
the four most frequently used codons were uuu-f , uua-l , auu-i  and uau-y   in med species, while in the new world were uuu-f , uua-l , auu-i  and aau-n  . to compare the usage of start and stop codons in species closely related to b. tabaci, nine species  within the suborder sternorrhyncha  were used  <cit> . results show that start codons  and stop codons  are used at different frequencies . incomplete stop codons have previously been found in insect mitogenomes and are common in metazoans  <cit> . in the process of post-transcriptional modification, the incomplete stop codon is polyadenylated to complete poly tail and changed t or ta to the taa stop codon  <cit> . in the med mitogenome, complete translation termination codons were used by ten genes, excluding cox <dig>  cox <dig> and nd <dig>  which have incomplete stop codons  <cit> . these three genes also used the incomplete t stop codon in the new world species. but in other seven species, incomplete stop codons were also used by different genes .

control regions
using long-pcr, two large non-coding regions were recovered from the med mitogenome, which was called putative control regions because of the following reasons. first, these two large non-coding regions can form stem-loop structures, which typically associated with the origins of replication/transcription. second, elements related to transcription and dna replication were found in both regions. third, new world b. tabaci was shown to have two control regions   <cit> . sequence analyses revealed that the two putative control regions were located in the same region in the mitogenomes of med and new world species. in both species, one of the putative control regions was located between rrns and trnn, while the other located between cox <dig> and trni . by analyzing these two areas, elements proposed to be involved in mitogenome replication and gene transcription were found in both control regions . in the first putative control region, both the med and new world mitogenomes have the same five elements: polyt stretch, an-like stretch, tata motif, stem and loop structure and gnt motif . however, in the second putative control region, the sequence of the transcription elements and the tandem repeat regions are different  <cit> . in the second putative control region of the med mitogenome, the -like stretch differs from the an-like stretch in that of new world . in addition, seven repeat units are found in the second control region of the med mitogenome. repeat units of r1-r <dig> are  <dig> bp long and the length of r <dig>  r <dig> is  <dig> bp . however, the second putative control region of the new world mitogenome contains  <dig> repeat unites, in which the r1-r <dig> repeat units are  <dig> bp long and the r <dig>  r <dig> repeats are  <dig> bp .

transcript reads mapping to the med mitogenome
ngs technologies have been applied to analyze the gene expression profile of mitochondrial-derived transcripts  <cit> . previously, we have sequenced the transcriptome of med and obtained  <dig> million  <dig> bp reads  <cit> . in this study, those sequencing reads were mapped onto the complete med mitogenome and the numbers of reads per base calculated . based on the mapped reads, we analyzed the reads depth for every base of the med mitogenome and found that the expression levels of individual mitochondrial genes  varied greatly from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads per base . for all coding regions, rrnl had the highest expression level, while nd4l the lowest. this result is similar to the findings in drosophila melanogaster and the pod borer maruca vitrata <cit> . the expression level of other pcgs, from highest to lowest, were cox <dig>  cox <dig>  atp <dig>  nd <dig>  cox <dig>  cytb, atp <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  rrns, nd <dig> and nd <dig>  such differences suggest that the expression profile of mitochondrial genes is highly variable   <cit> .

reads mapped to trnas and control regions
reads mapped to trna, pcgs and control regions can reveal different features for each of the segments. in the med mitogenome, the read coverage of trnas was relatively low compared to that of pcgs and no reads were recovered for some of trnas. in addition, a number of reads were mapped to putative control regions, indicating the existence of non-coding rna . the expression levels for the first and the second control regions were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, suggesting that the two putative control regions were transcribed at different levels. however, both functional and comparative studies are needed to examine whether these two putative control regions are real control regions  <cit> . in addition, some reads were also mapped to the intragenic spacer region and the expression level varied . these results suggest that while the control and intervening spacer regions are transcribed, their expression levels are lower than that of pcgs. interestingly, the same phenomenon has been found in the mitogenomes of mouse, pig and salamander  <cit> . the latest research also revealed that the mammalian mitogenomes encode abundant ncrnas besides the  <dig> known mitochondrial genes  <cit> . whether these ncrnas may play a role in post-transcriptional processing or simply reflect polycistronic transcription warrants further investigation.

polyadenylation of mitochondrial pcgs
the polyadenylation of mrnas plays critical roles in regulating gene expression, complementing coding information and determining gene boundaries  <cit> . to characterize the polyadenylation of med mitochondrial genes, sequencing reads mapped to the med mitogenome and having poly stretches at the 3’ end were analyzed further. interestingly, a number of reads with poly stretches were mapped at the end or downstream of the stop codons of cox <dig>  cox <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig>  nd <dig> and cytb genes . in addition, poly tail was found in the downstream of lrrna and srrna too. similar to the results found in drosophila <cit> , the partial stop codon in cox <dig>  cox <dig> and nd <dig> is completed via polyadenylation that changed t to the taa stop codon. poly signals are a common feature of eukaryotic pcgs  <cit> . from the reads mapped to the 3’ end of pcgs, some possible poly signals were recognized . furthermore, as the sequencing reads are only  <dig> bp, some poly signals were found in the upstream mitochondrial dna sequence. all of those poly signals were recognized 8– <dig> bp upstream of the poly tail. in the  <dig> pcgs with poly tails, different poly signals were found . these findings confirm that whitefly mitochondrial mrnas possess poly tail and 3’ proximal poly signals. in addition, these polyadenylation information was employed to annotate the exact termination site of pcgs  <cit> . indeed, the location of poly in the  <dig> pcgs supports the termination site of pcgs predicted via homologous annotation .

med mitochondrial polycistronic transcripts
generation of polycistronic transcripts is a distinct feature of many mitogenomes, and the co-transcription of genes may be used for regulation of gene expression  <cit> . two genes on the same mature polycistronic transcripts had been reported in the dipteran insects d. melanogaster, d. pseudoobscura and lepidopteran insect m. vitrata <cit> . to detect possible mature dicistronic transcripts, the assembled med transcriptome sequences were mapped to the med mitogenome. interestingly the atp <dig> and atp <dig> genes, nd4l and nd <dig> genes, and nd <dig> and cytb genes were found in the same contigs respectively . the assembled contigs may represent mature transcripts that are generated from trna punctuated cleavage of polycistronic transcripts  <cit> . in addition, we can clearly find dip in expression levels associated with the ends of these genes  . this is consistent with a mature dicistronic mrna. by default, if the mitochondrial genes are contiguous within the genome and lack of intervening trna, they are transcribed on the same cistrons. similarly, atp <dig> and atp <dig>  nd4l and nd <dig>  and nd <dig> and cytb genes are contiguous within the mitogenome and also exist in the same contigs.

single nucleotide polymorphism  in the med mitogenome
snps might be useful for discovering genes under selection and the dynamics of these genes in natural populations  <cit> . therefore snps in the med mitogenome were investigated using the  <dig> million illumina sequencing reads and only  <dig> snps were discovered . among the  <dig> snps,  <dig> were found in the coding region and  <dig> were observed in the control region. interestingly, all the  <dig> snps in the coding region  were c/g to a/t mutation; and only  <dig> snps in the gene of cox <dig>  nd <dig> lead to the amino acid changes. as the whitefly specimens used for rna-seq was derived from a laboratory colony, it is possible few snps were identified due to clonality. for practical purposes, field-collected whitefly populations, or species that had undergone different lab selections, regimes should be used to identify snps.

detecting pcg gene expression in different developmental stages
the mitogenome encodes proteins in the electron transport chain including nadh dehydrogenase , cytochrome b , and cytochrome c oxidase  and atp synthase . these proteins play important roles in oxidative phosphorylation and atp generation. many studies have shown different gene expression profiles of pcgs at different developmental stages  <cit> . however, the expression profile of mitochondrial genes at different developmental stages is poorly understood. using rt-pcr, the expression level of  <dig> pcgs was detected in the med nymphs, pupae, and adults . results showed that the expression level of individual mitochondrial genes varied between each developmental stage . we found that the atp <dig> gene had the highest expression level in different development stages. at the adult stage, the expression level of the  <dig> pcgs displayed greater differences than that of the other two stages. in every stage, genes belonging to respiratory complex iii and complex iv were expressed at higher levels than genes belonging to complex i. the same phenomenon existed in the early developmental stages of pig tissues  <cit> . interestingly, mrna levels not only differed among genes encoded by separate transcription units, but also showed significant differences among genes located in the same transcription unit . the same phenomena were found in drosophila and may be related to mrna stability and post-transcriptional mechanisms  <cit> .

discussion
next-generation sequencing is developing rapidly and many datasets have been generated in organisms whose mitochondrial genome is unknown  <cit> . however, many of the valuable rna-seq datasets were not analyzed in details. in this study, we have demonstrated that to obtain the mitogenome  based on existed rna-seq data is possible. this strategy can be valuable for the cloning of mitogenomes from other non-model organisms with a sequenced transcriptome. for the b. tabaci complex, even though the mitogenome of new world species has been sequenced, we thought that utilizing illumina sequence reads to obtain the med mitogenome was more efficient. because the mitogenomes of new world and med species are quite diverged , some primers directly designed according to the mitochondrial sequence of new world species may not be used to clone med genes. however, pcr primers can be designed according to the med illumina reads mapped to the new world mitogenome with nearly 100% confidence, therefore improve the probability of success . as many transcriptomes have been generated from different species, the transcriptome led approach is a useful way to extend existing data. in addition, this method may possibly be a solution or a guide for difficult to sequence mitogenomes.

the mitogenome of med, which is the type species of the b. tabaci complex, shows similarities to the previously published mitogenome of the new world species. both the mitogenomes have the identical set of genes in the same gene order with two putative control regions . however, the med genome is slightly longer due to the presence of additional variable repeat sequences in the second control region. codon usage differs between med and new world mitogenomes. overall, the med mitogenome has  <dig> % sequence divergence from that of the new world species, which is higher than the divergence at the cox <dig> barcode region . this is probably due to the fact that the cox <dig> sequences are more constrained than the other  <dig> pcgs and the presence of divergent noncoding regions . this finding is consistent with the previous claim that mitochondrial genes are susceptible to rapid evolution inferred from higher mutation rates and limited dna repair mechanisms. the analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous sites of pcgs between med and new world showed that atp <dig> was evolving under high selective pressure , whereas cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig> and atp <dig> had the lowest substitution rates. this finding suggests that cox <dig>  cox <dig>  cox <dig>  and atp <dig> may be used for reconstructing evolutionary relationships at the species level, while atp <dig> may be suitable for population level phylogenetic analysis.

est data is important to define gene boundaries, predict processed mitochondrial transcripts and reveal transcription process of mitogenome. mapping med rna-seq data to its mitogenome revealed a number of interesting characteristics about the med mitogenome, such as gene expression, noncoding rna, rna polyadenylation and cistronic transcript. noncoding rnas play important roles in the splicing site recognition during the processing of transcripts if they have the ability to form stable stem-loop structures  <cit> . intergenic noncoding rnas were found in the med mitogenome. previous rna-seq analyses had revealed that a number of intergenic noncoding rnas are expressed  <cit>  and noncoding rnas appear to contain functional information  <cit> , including transcription, rna splicing, editing, translation and turnover  <cit> . utrs and intronic regions flanking nuclear genes are critical for regulating its expression, but mitogenome lacks of these regions, indicating that the mitochondrial noncoding rna may serve as a backup mechanism to coordinate gene expression  <cit> . whether noncoding rnas found in med mitogenome have similar functions warrants further investigation. from the transcriptome data, rrnl had the highest expression level. in drosophila, the mitochondrial termination factor mterf binds just downstream of the 3′ end of the ribosomal gene cluster and is responsible for the higher expression levels of rrnas  <cit> . in new world mitogenome, the putative mterf binding site  should locate in the non-coding dna between nd <dig> and trna-ser, similar to philaenus  which is the hemipteran and very similar to lepidoptera  <cit> . in med mitogenome, although there is no non-coding region between nd <dig> and trna-ser, the same consensus sequence  was discovered at the 3' end of nd <dig>  interestingly, there are instances in beetles of frame shift mutations causing the mterf site to become part of the coding region despite no changes to the sequence of the recognition site  <cit> . therefore, we propose this region as the mterf binding site in the med mitogenome. interestingly, the mterf domain-containing protein 1-like and domain-containing protein 2-like were found in transctiptome data of med . this further suggests that the mterf binding site exists in the med mitogenome.

in med, atp8/ <dig>  nd4l/nd <dig> and nd6/cytb genes were found in the same dicistronic transcripts in mature mrna. generation of polycistronic transcripts is a common feature of many mitochondria and the co-transcription of genes is likely used for the regulation of gene expression  <cit> . previous research has demonstrated that mrnas that are smaller than ~ <dig> nucleotides interact with 28s subunit of the ribosome less readily than larger mrnas and for efficient binding, thus a minimum transcript length of ~ <dig> nucleotides is necessary  <cit> . this may partially explain why some mrnas  in the med mitogenome are dicistronic. in these dicistronic mrnas, both nad4l and atp <dig> are shorter than ~ <dig> nucleotides. therefore, both nad4l and atp <dig> need to form a dicistronic mrna with downstream genes to initiate the protein translation efficiently  <cit> . in dicistronic transcripts, the downstream gene lose the 5' untranslated region, which are capable of forming extensive secondary structures and play important roles in post-transcriptional events  <cit> . in dicistronic transcripts of med, absence of 5' untranslated regions of atp <dig>  nd <dig>  cytb genes may increase the efficiency of translation, suggesting a different role for the persistence of dicistronic molecules  <cit> . interestingly, for the dicistronic nd6/cytb and atp8/atp <dig> transcripts, poly stretches were found in the 3' end of nd <dig> and atp <dig> genes. similarly, in the tricistronic transcript  of drosophila, poly stretches were found in the 3' terminus of atp <dig> and atp <dig>  which suggest the variation in mitochondrial transcript cleavage events may occur in the insects  <cit> . analyses of mitochondrial transcripts in additional species are needed to reveal the mechanism of the polycistronic processing in mitochondria.

the poly tail has been identified to possibly contribute to translational control  <cit>  and mrna degradation  <cit> . in this study, pcgs of the med mitogenome were found to have varying lengths of poly tails and some of the poly tails were critical to generate the uaa termination codon. previous studies on mrna polyadenylation concluded that the central sequence motif aauaaa was essential for mrna polyadenylation and 3' end formation, but recent studies of est databases suggest that the frequency of the motif appeared low  <cit> . in our study, different possible poly signals were also found in eight pcgs of the med mitogenome.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the mitogenome of the invasive b. tabaci med species contains the same gene rearrangement as that of the new world species. using transcriptome data, the expression profile and the termination location of some genes were determined. in addition, polyadenylation, polycistronic transcripts and snps were discovered in b. tabaci mitogenome for the first time. the results presented here also demonstrate that utilizing rna-seq data to analyze gene expression characteristics of mitogenome is practical. the med and new world mitogenomes are interesting but the real utility of the sequence data comes from a comparative approach and it is our recommendation to sequence all of the mitogenomes for the species. with the inclusion of additional mitogenomes, patterns of mitochondrial gene expression and differences of energy usage in invasive and indigenous species could be tested.
