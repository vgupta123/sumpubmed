BACKGROUND
the initiation and progression of intimal thickening in arterial walls is largely due to migration and subsequent proliferation of smooth muscle cells  in the sub-intimal space in response to various stimuli including oxidized low density lipoprotein , circulating growth factors, and inflammatory cytokines such as platelet-derived growth factor , tumor necrosis factor -α, and interleukin- <dig>   <cit> . of these, pdgf, a growth factor released by vascular smc, endothelial cells, and platelets, has been reported as the most potent inducer of smc migration within the injured area of the vascular wall.

pdgf is a heparin-binding growth factor composed of polypeptide chains that can be assembled into homodimers  or heterodimer  structures and bind to two related cell-surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity, pdgf receptor α and β  <cit> . in the last few years two additional homodimers pdgf-cc and pdgf-dd were also discovered  <cit> . pdgf binding to its cognate receptors results in dimerization, and subsequent auto-phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues outside the kinase domain, creating a docking site for sh <dig> domain-containing signaling proteins. a large number of sh <dig> domain containing proteins including the phsophatidylinositol- <dig> kinase , phospholipase c-γ , the tyrosine phosphatase shp- <dig>  ras gtpase activating protein , grb <dig>  grb <dig>  nck, and the src family of tyrosine kinases have been shown to bind to cytoplasmic tails of pdgf receptors activating various downstream signaling proteins involved in cell growth, proliferation, survival, and migration  <cit> .

cellular migration is regulated via a complex interaction between growth factors that attach to their cognate receptors, transmembrane integrins that bind to the components of extracellular matrix, and mechanical stress, all of which cooperatively induce polymerization and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. these events are coordinated by mechanisms involved in assembly or disassembly of local adhesion sites, transient changes in actin filaments dynamics, and formation of discrete structures such as stress actin fibers, membrane ruffles, lamellipodia, and filopodia  <cit> . integrin-linked kinase , a serine-threonine protein kinase containing a catalytic domain at c terminus, a central pleckstrin homology -like domain, and four ankyrin-like repeats at the n terminus, is an important component of focal adhesion complex anchoring actin filaments to integrin receptors and the cell membrane  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that ilk regulates fibroblast migration through the phosphatidylinositol- <dig> kinase   <cit> , osteosarcoma cell spreading and motility via rho-associated kinase   <cit> , and mammary epithelial cell migration through the guanine nucleotide exchange factor α-pix  <cit> .

there is also growing evidence on the cooperation between pdgf receptor and integrins in regulating cellular survival and adhesion  <cit> . however, little is known about the existence of cross-talk between ilk and pdgf signaling in vascular smooth muscle cells and the probable regulatory role of ilk during pdgf-induced smc migration. in the present study, we have examined the potential function for ilk as an upstream protein regulating the migratory response to pdgf in a primary mouse aortic smc culture. we have also characterized one downstream pathway that mediates the regulatory role of ilk in modulation actin polymerization and smc migration.

RESULTS
pdgf activates integrin-linked kinase in mouse aortic smcs
to study the effect of pdgf treatment on ilk activation, mouse aortic smcs were treated with  <dig> ng/ml of pdgf-bb for various timepoints and cell lysates were collected and subjected to the kinase activity assay. as shown, pdgf treatment increased ilk kinase activity around  <dig> minutes post treatment in the smc culture without having any significant effect on total ilk protein expression. pdgf-induced ilk kinase activity declined around  <dig> minutes after treatment . to ensure the specificity of the test and as a negative control, a group of smcs culture was transfected with specific ilk sirna for  <dig> hours. such treatment completely abolished ilk protein expression in smcs . as shown, very little kinase activity was detected in ilk-sirna group confirming that the results of the kinase activity assay is specific. it is noteworthy that we carefully monitored the morphology of smcs transfected with ilk sirna for the incubation period prior to pdgf treatment  to assure that sirna treatment had no cytotoxic effect on mouse smc .

pdgf induces smc migration through an ilk-dependent pathway
to investigate the potential function of ilk in regulation of pdgf-induced smc migration, cells were transfected with specific ilk sirna, and then treated with  <dig> ng/ml of pdgf-bb. the migratory response was measured using both modified transwell boyden chamber and wound healing assays. inhibition of ilk protein expression markedly decreased smc migration indicating that the presence of ilk was required for transducing the migratory signal stimulated by pdgf-bb .

pdgf is considered as a very potent mitogen. the observed effect of pdgf-bb on wound closure in figure 2b could be due to the effect of this growth factor on smc proliferation and/or migration. thus, to determine whether the proliferatory effect of pdgf-bb had contributed to the observed increase in cell migration., cells were treated with increasing doses of pdgf-bb for  <dig> hours , and cell proliferation and migration were measured using the modified transwell boyden chamber assay and mts cell proliferation assay, respectively. treatment of primary mouse smcs with  <dig> ng/ml of pdgf-bb significantly increased cell migration without having any noticeable effect on smc proliferation. to assure the accuracy of both assays and as a positive control, mouse smc culture were also treated with 10% serum. these findings emphasized that the observed increase in cell migration in both assays used in this study  was due to the pro-migratory, not proliferatory, effect of pdgf-bb on mouse aortic smc .

ilk inhibition abolishes pdgf-induced p <dig> mapk activation in mouse aortic smc culture
studies in various in vitro models, have shown that members of the family of the mitogen activated protein kinases  become activated and play a crucial role in regulating cell migration in response to pdgf treatment  <cit> . however, the actual mechanisms underlying this activation and the identity of the upstream kinases involved are not fully elucidated. here, we first characterized the dynamics of mapks family activation in response to pdgf-bb treatment in our primary mouse aortic smc model. in agreement with previous reports in various cell models, pdgf-bb treatment resulted in the phosphorylation of all three members of mapks family, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/ <dig> , jun n-terminus kinase , and p <dig> mapk starting around  <dig> minutes and with a peak activation at 20- <dig> minutes post-treatment .

to investigate the role of each member of mapks family in regulating pdgf-induced cell migration, smcs were treated with specific mek/erk1/ <dig> inhibitor , jnk inhibitor , and p <dig> mapk inhibitor  for two hours prior to pdgf-bb treatment and cell migration was measured using the modified transwell boyden chamber assay. inhibition of all members of mapks family markedly reduced mouse smc migration in response to pdgf-bb treatment .

various components of focal adhesion complex have been shown to regulate or cross talk with members of mapks family  <cit> . ilk, as a key constituent of the focal adhesion complex, also plays an important function in transducing inside-out and outside-in signals  <cit> . to investigate the role of ilk in regulating mapks activation in response to pdgf, smcs were transfected with specific ilk sirna prior to pdgf-bb treatment. inhibition of ilk expression with specific sirna resulted in significant decrease in pdgf-induced p <dig> mapk phosphorylation , while having no effect on erk1/ <dig> and jnk phosphorylation . this observation suggests that ilk presence is required for pdgf-induced phosphorylation of p <dig> mapk in mouse smc.

ilk mediates pdgf-induced mouse aortic smc migration through a p <dig> mapk-dependent pathway
taking into account that pdgf-bb activates both ilk and p <dig> mapk in mouse aortic smcs , and the observation that p <dig> mapk has a crucial role in pdgf-induced cell migration ; we sought to determine whether ilk can also modulate the migratory effect of p <dig> mapk activation in response to pdgf-bb. to examine this hypothesis, we utilized a gain and loss of function approach using adenoviral constructs of ilk and/or p <dig> mapk.

in order to revalidate the important role of p <dig> mapk activation during the migratory response, and also to exploit a more target-specific approach, we first infected primary mouse smcs with adenoviral constructs expressing either a dominant negative form of p <dig> mapk , a wild type form of p <dig> mapk , or a gfp  protein. western blot analysis  and fluorescent microscopy  were used to evaluate the transfection efficiency at  <dig> hours post transfection .

in concurrence with our previous observations, over-expression of a dominant negative mutant of p <dig> mapk significantly reduced pdgf-induced smc migration . furthermore, over-expression of a wild type form of p <dig> rescued smc migration in response to pdgf-bb, corroborating the specificity of p <dig> mapk inhibition in mouse smc culture transfected with the ad-dn-p <dig> mapk construct .

moreover, a kinase-deficient form of ilk , which is also incapable of binding to paxillin and parvin and therefore unable to participate in formation of the focal adhesion complex, resulted in a significant decline in pdgf-induced smc migration, an event that can be reversed by a wild type form of ilk .

finally, to establish a cause and effect association between inhibition of ilk, a downstream decrease in p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, and the subsequent decline in cell migration, we co-transfected cells with a kinase deficient form of ilk  along with an active form of mkk3/ <dig>  or a wild type form of p <dig> mapk. as shown, expression of ad-ca-mkk3/ <dig> significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of ilk inhibition  in pdgf-treated smcs . in contrast, over-expression of the wild type p <dig> mapk in smcs already transfected with ad-kd-ilk, did not rescue cell migration, confirming our previous observation that the existence of an active form of ilk was required to facilitate the p <dig> mapk-mediated migratory response to pdgf-bb .

ilk and p <dig> mapk regulate pdgf-induced actin cytoskeleton polymerization in vascular smc
actin polymerization and re-organization is a critical step in cell motility and migration. to characterize the role of ilk and p <dig> mapk in regulating actin polymerization in response to pdgf, cells were transfected with specific ilk sirna  or treated with specific p <dig> mapk inhibitor  prior to pdgf treatment. inhibition of ilk expression and p <dig> mapk activity significantly blocked pdgf-induced actin polymerization and re-organization in mouse smc, indicating a crucial role for ilk and p <dig> mapk in regulation actin-mediated cell migration .

discussion
vascular smc migration contributes to the intimal thickening in occlusive vascular diseases. following vascular injury, smc migratory response to various stimuli begins with activation of cell surface receptors followed by remodeling events that involve focal adhesion complex and filament actin remodeling. various cytokines, peptide growth factors, and components of the extracellular matrix  have been characterized as pro-migratory molecules.

pdgf is a very potent stimulant for smc migration through activation of several signaling pathways  <cit> . in vascular smc, pdgf activates multiple signaling cascades including the pi3k/akt, protein kinase a , src, ras, and mapks signaling. the family of mapks comprises three distinct protein kinases, p <dig> mapk, jnk, and erk1/ <dig>  all of which have been shown to be involved in vascular diseases and remodeling  <cit> .

on another note, integrin clustering and its downstream signals are necessary for smc adhesion to ecm, an event that also initiates pro-migratory responses within the vascular wall. mawatari and colleagues have shown that in human saphenous vein smcs beta- <dig> integrin is required for growth factor and cytokine-induced proliferation  <cit> . it is believed that a coordinated cross-talk between integrins and growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors is necessary for the effective modulation of cell survival, growth, proliferation, and migration  <cit> .

ilk is a key protein of focal adhesion complex connecting β <dig> and β <dig> integrins in plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeletal machinery. ilk also interacts with growth factor receptors through the nh2-terminal ankyrin repeat domain and small gtpase signaling molecules such as nck- <dig>  <cit> . previous reports on the effect of pdgf on ilk expression and activity in non-muscle cell cultures were controversial. while campana et al reported on a pdgf-induced increase in ilk activity in primary rat schwann cells  <cit> , janji and colleagues proposed that pdgf had no effect on ilk expression in melanoma ht- <dig> cells  <cit> , indicating that the outcome of pdgf treatment on ilk signaling is cell specific.

in the present study, we have shown that pdgf-bb treatment results in an increase in ilk kinase activity in mouse aortic smc culture. it is of importance that the increase in ilk kinase activity in smcs is associated with a considerable increase in expression of both β <dig> and β <dig> integrins . it is well known that the adhesive function of integrin receptors affects cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell motility. therefore, it is presumable that increase in β <dig> and β <dig> integrins expression contributes to the pro-migratory effect of pdgf-bb in smc culture. however, further investigation is required to evaluate the potential cross-talk between β <dig> and β <dig> integrins and pdgf receptors and the significance of such events in vascular smc migration.

numerous studies have provided a wealth of information on the crucial regulatory role for ilk as a protein kinase and also as a molecular scaffold and adaptor protein during cell spreading and migration in a variety of cancer cells  <cit> . moreover, a recent study has shown that an increase in ilk expression coincides with higher rate of smc migration within the atherosclerotic plaque in apoe -/- mice, a reliable model that mimics the progression of atherosclerosis in humans  <cit> . on the contrary, ho et al has shown that following balloon catheter injury of the rat carotid artery, a significant decrease in ilk expression is associated with an elevation in vascular smc proliferation and migration  <cit> . nevertheless, there is no clear understanding as to how ilk contributes to the intimal thickening in response to growth factors and cytokines released during the development of the atherosclerotic plaque, and the mechanisms by which ilk may modulate vascular smc migration to the sub-intimal layer of the vascular wall.

in this study, we examined the role of ilk in cell migration, by inhibiting  or increasing  ilk expression. inhibition of ilk by different means significantly decreased cell migration in response to pdgf-bb, demonstrating that ilk plays an important role in regulating pdgf-induced vascular smc migration. expression of a wild type form of ilk increased smc migration even in the absence of growth factor. it is noteworthy that the effect of wild type ilk in increasing smc migration is more evident when smcs were treated with pdgf-bb . these observations are in agreement with previous report by dwivedi et al  <cit>  that over-expression of a dominant negative form of ilk markedly reduced intimal thickening in human saphenous vein organ culture.

ilk mutation within the catalytic domain  disrupts the interaction and binding of ilk with two important components of focal adhesion complex, β-parvin and paxillin. this interaction is required for the assembly of a functional focal adhesion complex and subsequent actin polymerization and reorganization  <cit> . over-expression of the e395k mutant of ilk resulted in significant reduction in pdgf-induced smc migration. the effect was fully reversed by a wild type form of ilk. these findings further underscore the crucial function of ilk as molecular scaffold during smc migration.

in an effort to understand how ilk mediates the pro-migratory effect of pdgf-bb in primary mouse smc using rna silencing technique, we were able to show that ilk inhibition could lead to a considerable decrease in p <dig> mapk phosphorylation, while having no visible effect on erk1/ <dig> and jnk phosphorylation in response to pdgf-bb treatment. we also demonstrated that over-expression of an active form of mkk3/ <dig>  dramatically reversed the inhibitory effect of ilk inhibition on smc migration. expression of a wild type form of p <dig> mapk markedly increased smc migration in the presence of pdgf-bb; however, it could not restore migratory response in cells over-expressing a kinase deficient form of ilk. it is of importance that the latter observation accentuates the view that the presence of a functional ilk is required for the initiation of a p <dig> mapk-dependent migratory response to pdgf-bb in mouse aortic smcs. further studies are required to characterize the precise mechanisms underlying the ilk-mediated regulation of p <dig> mapk in smcs.

actin polymerization and reorganization is a crucial step in cell migration. we have shown that pdgf increases actin polymerization and filament reorganization in smcs. this event was significantly blocked by both ilk sirna and p <dig> mapk inhibitor, confirming the importance of this pathway in regulating smc migration. the actual mechanism by which p <dig> mapk may regulate cell migration is not well understood. actin polymerization and reorganization is under rigorous regulation by a group of protein kinases and/or phosphatases that coordinate the constant turnover of actin filaments in a stimulated cell. among these, cofilin is a conserved actin-binding protein that enhances actin filament reorganization through de-polymerization and severing of preexisting actin filaments  <cit> . it is well known that phosphorylation of cofilin  by lim kinase  and testicular protein kinase  <dig>  results in deactivation of cofilin and subsequent inhibition of actin reorganization  <cit> . in mouse aortic smcs, pdgf treatment resulted in rapid de-phosphorylation and activation of cofilin around 5- <dig> minutes post-treatment . pdgf also increased limk phosphorylation leading to phosphorylation and deactivation of cofilin . the feedback mechanism provides a strict control system for cell responses to migratory stimuli such as pdgf. our preliminary observation suggests that p <dig> mapk may control actin reorganization partly via regulating the de-phosphorylation and consequent activation of cofilin . further detailed studies are ongoing in our laboratory to characterize the signaling network and downstream pathways mediating such regulatory events.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have provided evidence that ilk is an important regulator of mouse vascular smooth muscle cell migration in response to pdgf-bb by modulating p <dig> mapk phosphorylation. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the regulation of p <dig> mapk by integrin signaling in mediating platelet-derived growth factor-induced migration in vascular smooth muscles. future in vivo studies using specific small molecule inhibitors for ilk and/or p <dig> mapk as well as developing transgenic animal models will provide additional information on the potential therapeutic value of integrin signaling, in general, and the integrin-linked kinase, in particular, in controlling vascular smooth muscle cell migration during the progression of occlusive vascular diseases.
