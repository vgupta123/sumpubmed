BACKGROUND
hypoxia causes cellular stress. in order to survive cells turn on adaptive mechanisms to improve oxygen transport and to ensure sufficient cellular atp supply  <cit> . central to this adaptation is the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor- <dig> , which stimulates genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis and glycolysis  <cit> . hif- <dig> consists of an o2-regulated α-subunit  and a constitutively expressed β-subunit . under normoxic conditions hif-1α is continuously degraded by a family of prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes , which hydroxylate two proline residues  in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of hif-1α  <cit> . this allows its recognition by the von hippel-lindau protein e <dig> ubiquitin ligase complex and proteasomal degradation  <cit> . conversely, under hypoxia hydroxylation of hif-1α is impaired, proteasomal degradation is offset thus, provoking its accumulation. hif-1α is hydroxylated in an oxygen-dependent manner pointing to phds as the cellular oxygen sensors  <cit> . in addition to the regulation of hif-1α protein stability, the transcriptional activity of hif- <dig> is regulated by hydroxylation of asn- <dig> in the c-terminal trans-activating domain of hif-1α. an asparagyl hydroxylase known as factor inhibiting hif   <cit>  catalyzes this modification and interferes with the transcriptional activity of hif-1α by blocking cofactor binding, e.g. p300/creb  <cit> .

besides hypoxia, nitric oxide  and/or no-derived species regulate hif-1α abundance and activity. under normoxic conditions, no donors induce hif-1α stabilization and transcriptional activation of hif- <dig> target genes  <cit> . mechanistically, no-dependent inhibition of phd activity accounts for hif-1α protein stabilization  <cit> , although increased synthesis mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or mitogen-activated protein kinase has been noticed  <cit> . paradoxically, under hypoxic conditions, no appears to destabilize rather than to stabilize hif-1α. nitric oxide donors  decrease hypoxia-elicited hif-1α stabilization and hif- <dig> transcriptional activation  <cit> . it is suggested that mitochondria play a role in no-mediated regulation of hif-1α under hypoxia  <cit> . hagen et al. proposed that inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by no during hypoxia reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption, leaving more oxygen available for phds to regain activity thus, allowing hif-1α degradation  <cit> . furthermore, no-derived species and/or reactive oxygen species have been suggested to destabilize hif-1α by their ability to reactivate phds  <cit> . recently, calcium induced activation of calpain were also implicated in the degradation of hif-1α by no under hypoxia, adding a layer of complexity to hif- <dig> regulation  <cit> . since hypoxia and no modulate hif-1α in different microenvironments, we were prompted to investigate whether the modulation of hif-1α by hypoxia or no would generate identical or restricted gene profiles. using pairwise comparison of the gene profile data generated by cells treated with hypoxia and/or no, we were able to study the influence of no on the gene expression profile of hypoxia-induced genes, as well as that of hypoxia on no-induced genes. herein we have used a combined nro and microarray approach to study the crosstalk between hypoxia/no on the genetic profile of hypoxia- or no-regulated genes in raw  <dig>  macrophages.

RESULTS
transcripts generated by hypoxia and/or deta-no in macrophages
the intention of this study was to identify hypoxia- or nitric oxide-regulated genes by a systematic analysis of de novo  transcription and to question whether regulation of hif1α by hypoxia or nitric oxide would generate overlapping gene profiles. we chose to analyze newly synthesized mrna obtained by nro. this allowed detection of bona fide transcriptionally regulated genes, thus reducing the interference of steady-state mrna turnover on the pool of expressed mrna common to conventional microarray analysis. therefore, raw  <dig>  cells were exposed to hypoxia , deta-no , or a combination of hypoxia and no for  <dig> h. transcriptional changes were systematically assessed using affymetrix microarray analysis, which allowed following  <dig> transcripts.  <cit> . most gene transcripts  remained unchanged by either hypoxia or no, as well as in the combination of both. only  <dig> genes were regulated by hypoxia with the majority being upregulated . the greater number of the transcripts regulated by hypoxia is linked to energy consumption through glycolysis. nitric oxide regulated a set of  <dig> genes shown in supplementary table  <dig> , while treatment of cells with both hypoxia and no regulated  <dig> transcripts . figure  <dig> gives an overview of all groups with their number of regulated genes. comparing gene profiles following treatments with hypoxia and/or no, we observed that only  <dig> genes  were common to all treatments. it is not surprising that many of these genes have roles in cell death, dna damage and apoptosis since under stress conditions cells try to avoid cell demise. most of these genes had been previously described as hypoxia or no regulated  <cit> , underscoring the validity of this approach. interestingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> common genes  were upregulated by hypoxia and/or no, whereas  <dig>  were downregulated . most genes upregulated by hypoxia or no were more strongly regulated under hypoxia, with the exception of scd <dig> and sesn <dig>  whose levels were slightly higher with no. for the commonly downregulated genes  <dig> out of the  <dig> identified ones were regulated to the same extent by hypoxia or no. interestingly, only one gene being downregulated  revealed different levels of inhibition between hypoxia and no, albeit being the strongest suppressed gene in the list. hypoxia and no downregulated fxyd <dig>  <dig> -folds and  <dig> -folds compared to controls. contrary to the finding in this study, fxyd <dig> has been shown to be upregulated in the mouse carotid body in response to 10% hypoxia  <cit> , suggesting a different regulation pattern for this protein at different oxygen pressures. fxyd <dig> affects the ion transport system of the blood brain barrier and modulates na+ absorption during cystic fibrosis  <cit> . the notion that no decreased chloride adsorption by reducing na+-k+-2cl- cotransporter activity and inhibits transepithelial ion movement in cystic fibrosis  <cit>  corroborates our finding on repression of fxyd <dig>  fxyd <dig> interacts with the na+-k+-atpase and modulates its properties after no-treatment  <cit> .

this list was obtained by comparing profiles of genes detected by the three treatments, excluding duplicate transcripts, unknown transcripts and transcripts not detected in one or two of the treatments. no = nitric oxide ; hyp = hypoxic treatment .

in table  <dig> we listed a total of  <dig> genes common to macrophages treated with hypoxia or no alone. the  <dig> transcripts consist of the  <dig> transcripts found in all treatments  plus additional  <dig> transcripts . eleven of the  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated by no, while  <dig> genes were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated by hypoxia. interestingly in this category we identified ccl <dig>  ligand  <dig>  known as macrophage inflammatory protein  <dig> alpha , to be downregulated by hypoxia but upregulated by no. recent studies have shown that hypoxia preferentially regulates the accumulation of mononuclear phagocytes in hypoxic/ischemic areas  <cit> . our data show that no alone upregulated ccl <dig> twofold compared to untreated cells, whereas hypoxia downregulated ccl <dig> twofold. this finding correlates well with the report that hypoxia downregulates several members of the c-c ligand chemokine family including ccl <dig> , mip1β or ccl <dig>   <cit>  or ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  <cit> . considering that chemokine signaling regulates monocyte/macrophage recruitment to inflammatory sites downregulation of these mediators by hypoxia may be necessary to prevent cell death and to limit the influx of pro-inflammatory cytokine producing cells. in contrast, no with its pro- and anti-inflammatory properties upregulated ccl <dig>  nitric oxide was shown to be coregulated with the chemokine mcp- <dig> in kupffer cells treated with lps  <cit>  but a causative role for no in mcp- <dig> regulation could not be established. however, there is evidence that no is required for lps-induced mcp- <dig> or mrp <dig> expression  <cit> . it is important that ccl <dig>  regulated either by hypoxia or no alone, showed no expression regulation when cells were subjected to both treatments. this observation indicates a complex interplay between hypoxia and no, with signal elimination under hypoxia/no.

gene transcripts regulated by hypoxia  or no  were analyzed to identify overlapping genes in these set of data. hyp = hypoxia treatment; no = nitric oxide treatment.

considering that hif- <dig> regulates a number of genes under hypoxia  <cit>  or in response to no, we were interested to examine opposing regulation patterns. therefore, we analyzed to what extent hypoxia affects the gene profile generated by no. we compared profiles of cells treated with no to cells treated with no plus hypoxia . we identified  <dig> genes in response to no or hypoxia plus no. the patterns of gene profiles were similar for both treatments, though significant differences exist in the expression levels of some transcripts in response to no or hypoxia/no. thirty of the transcripts  were upregulated and only  <dig>  were downregulated by both treatments. however, we noticed gene specific regulation when both data were compared. the majority of the upregulated genes  revealed no changes in their expression when hypoxia was added to no while  <dig> transcripts  were increased 2- to 6-fold, compared to treatments with no alone. this suggests an additive effect cause by hypoxia on the expression of these transcripts. amongst the commonly upregulated genes only one transcript  was moderately upregulated when cells were cotreated with hypoxia plus no compared to no alone. for most of the transcripts downregulated by no,  <dig> genes  did not show changes in their expression levels in the presence of hypoxia compared to their expression with no alone. interestingly fxyd <dig>  which was the most prominent downregulated transcript by no  was significantly relieved of this effect when subjected to hypoxia plus no.

this list of  <dig> genes was obtained by comparing the no -generated gene profile to that generated by hypoxia  plus no. hyp = hypoxia treatment; no = nitric oxide treatment.

in another set of data analysis we determined the effect of no on the gene profiles of hypoxia-generated transcripts. a comparison of gene profiles generated by hypoxia was performed against the profile generated by cells treated with hypoxia plus no . a total of  <dig> transcripts were obtained in this category, with  <dig> genes being upregulated, while  <dig> were downregulated by both conditions . fifty-five transcripts upregulated under both conditions did not show significant changes in expression profiles when no was added compared to hypoxia alone, whereas  <dig> genes in this category  were influenced by no. interestingly, amongst the  <dig> genes that showed changes in gene expression due to the presence of no, the majority of  <dig> genes  showed a lower level of expression when cells were cotreated with hypoxia and no compared to hypoxia alone. this suggests that no attenuated the induction of hypoxia-induced transcripts. one plausible explanation for this observation could be attributed to the ability of no to destabilize hif-1α under hypoxic condition. further studies involving hif-1α deficient cells are necessary to support the role of hif-1α in this process. on the other hand, no was able to augment the expression of a few transcripts  upregulated by hypoxia alone. the heterogeneous influence of no on hypoxia-regulated gene profiles is in agreement with its ability to participate in direct and indirect signaling and to induce overlapping signaling pathways with hypoxia. no activates soluble guanylyl cyclase to generate cgmp and in turn to activate cgmp-dependent protein kinases  <cit> . no also reacts with superoxide  to generate peroxynitrite , potentially causing tissue damage and nucleic acid modifications  <cit> . there is evidence that large amounts of no and ros, produced during inflammation shift the no chemistry towards indirect effects such as nitrosation, nitration and oxidation  <cit> .

finally, we compared the array data from all treatments to identify transcripts that were only seen in cells cotreated with hypoxia and no but neither with hypoxia or no alone. one-hundred and sixty-two unique transcripts were identified in this category, suggesting that the cross-talk between hypoxia and no might be responsible for their regulation. the majority of the transcripts  were upregulated, while the other  <dig> transcripts  were downregulated . a few of the genes identified here had been reported by other investigators to be regulated by no  or hypoxia  but not by the combination of both. the majority of the unique transcripts identified in this study are unknown to be hypoxia or no-dependent. this finding suggests alternative pathways for the regulation of these unique transcripts, which may involve multiple scenarios of cross-talks between hypoxia and no operating in inflammation or cancer. taken together, from our analysis and gene expression profiles generated in many array studies with different cell types, one can conclude that there is a core of genes consistently modulated by hypoxia or no, while a large number of genes exhibited cell-type-specific changes.

verification of micro array data by qrt-pcr analysis
despite the fact that our microarray data can be correlated to previous array studies with similar regulation patterns for several gene transcripts, we performed an independent validation of our data by rt-pcr after the isolation of whole cell rna either from raw  <dig>  or primary mouse macrophages. nine genes  that were either up- or downregulated in our as well as other arrays, were chosen. result obtained by rt-pcr  confirmed the regulation pattern of the selected genes obtained by microarray analysis. however, there were gene specific variations in the expression levels for some of the transcripts. changes in gene expression levels obtained with rt-pcr tend to be slightly lower compared to microarray data for most of the genes examined. similar observations have been reported by other studies  <cit>  and were attributed to different factors, including the sensitivity of the different methods, cross-interference between transcripts because of the large size of transcripts examined together  and the quality of mrna  <cit> .

raw cells were subjected to hypoxia  or no  for  <dig> h and primary macrophages for  <dig> h. whole cell mrna was isolated and analyzed by qrt-pcr. expression changes of  <dig> genes were evaluated in relation to the values obtained in parallel for 16s ribosomal protein obtained from  <dig> individual experiments. hyp = hypoxic treatment; no = nitric oxide treatment.

proteomics analysis
a number of studies addressed the question whether changes in mrna are reflected in corresponding changes in protein abundance  <cit> . often, poor correlations have been reported between rna transcriptions and protein levels and in some cases, little or no correlations were obtained  <cit> . given the complexities of protein expression and the many stages at which it may be controlled, differences between rna expression and protein expression are perhaps to be expected. nevertheless we performed 2-d gel protein analysis to examine a genome wide change in protein expression of raw cells after hypoxia- and no-treatments to verify array data. sample aliquots were labeled with two different fluorescent dyes  and the internal control standard, actin, was stained with cy <dig>  2-d page was prepared and run as previously described  <cit> . gels were scanned and data analysis was preformed by the bioinformatic section of genedata, basel, switzerland. comparing the intensity of the fluorescence of the scanned gels containing four samples for each treatment , we identified  <dig> spots that showed at least twofold higher or lower changes in protein expression compared to controls . expression changes in  <dig>  spots, regulated after hypoxia, were significant as estimated by the student t-test . eight  of the  <dig> significantly regulated spots were upregulated, whereas  <dig>  were downregulated. interestingly, this finding correlates with our array studies, where hypoxia upregulated more gene transcripts than it downregulated.

to analyze the effect of no on hypoxia regulated spots, we compared the expression patterns of hypoxia vs. hypoxia plus no data . twenty-one spots showed at least + <dig> or - <dig> folds changes in protein expression when cells were treated with hypoxia alone compared to cells treated with a combination of hypoxia and no. thirteen of the regulated proteins were significant by student t-test. in this analysis, the majority,  <dig> spots  out of the  <dig> significant spots were downregulated and only  <dig> spots  were up regulated. the higher number of downregulated spots seen when cells were cotreated with hypoxia and no is consistent with the array data and suggest that no predominantly attenuates gene expression when combined with hypoxia. furthermore, spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of figure  <dig>  which were significantly upregulated by hypoxia, were downregulated when macrophages were cotreated with hypoxia and no . there was a strong correlation between the array and the proteomics data based on regulatory patterns seen on gene regulation profiles as a whole as well as on the effect of no on hypoxia regulated gene patterns. however, at the level of individual proteins, we were unable to prove corresponding gene regulation patterns for specific genes/proteins. finally to identify and annotate some of the differentially expressed spots of interest, we conducted mass spectrometry  analysis. a total of  <dig> spots significantly regulated by hypoxia and/or no were chosen for further identification. we identified spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were significantly upregulated by hypoxia in this study as cofilin- <dig> , ferretin heavy chain , comm domain-containing protein <dig> , ferritin light chain- <dig> protein  and peroxiredoxin , respectively. consistent with our studies, antioxidants , iron homeostatic  and cofilin- <dig> are implicated in the hypoxia signaling cascade  <cit> . interestingly, we are reporting for the first time the identification of comm domain containing protein  <dig> as significantly upregulated in cells treated with hypoxia. presumably all comm_domain containing proteins are located in the nucleus and the comm domain plays a role in protein-protein interactions. several family members have been shown to bind and inhibit nf-κb. other proteins identified in this study include nucleoside diphosphate kinase b  and 40s ribosomal protein s <dig> , which were significantly downregulated when macrophages were cotreated with hypoxia and no but not by hypoxia alone. the interplay between no and hypoxia has important functional implications, expanding and enriching the possibilities for modulating stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS
by eliminating the interference of steady state mrna in gene expression profiling, we obtained lower number of significantly regulated transcripts in our study compared to published microarray data and identified previously unknown hypoxia-induced targets. gene analysis profiling corroborated the interplay between no- and hypoxia-induced signaling.
