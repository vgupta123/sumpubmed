BACKGROUND
menopause, one of the most clear-cut features of female mammalian aging, ensues when the ovarian follicle pool is depleted  <cit> . hormonal regulation of ovulation from antral follicles is well studied, and many gene mutations and disruptive agents are known to affect oocyte quality and quantity at defined stages of ovary development and maturation. however, the formation and maintenance of the follicle reserve have remained less defined  <cit> . similarly unclear is the mechanism that connects follicle formation – perhaps the most critical stage of ovary differentiation – to sex determination, the process whereby the sexually bipotential gonad forms either a testis or an ovary  <cit> .

acting with the master regulator sry, a large number of genes are currently known to drive testis differentiation in mammals . by contrast, although several potent regulatory genes that act in early ovary development have been identified – including those encoding the secreted proteins wnt <dig> and rspo <dig>  and the transcription factors, dax1/nr0b <dig> and foxl <dig> – their relation to now classical hypotheses about the genetic basis of female sex determinantion in mammals  <cit>  is still debated, and their mechanism of action is controversial . one striking distinction among them is that the other "early ovarian" genes are mainly expressed in somatic cells of the bipotential gonad in both sexes; but foxl <dig> is only expressed in females. furthermore, mutations in foxl <dig> are notably involved in three well-defined conditions that cover the entire spectrum of ovarian pathology: premature ovarian failure with and without ovarian dysgenesis in humans  <cit> ; blockage of follicle formation with secondary partial ovary-to-testis sex reversal in mice  <cit> ; and embryonic sex reversal, sometimes leading to complete xx maleness in goats  <cit> .

we have further shown that in mice the combined loss of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> leads to extensive gonadal xx sex reversal involving all cell lineages  <cit> . a similar degree of sex reversal was recently obtained in a mouse knockout model for rspo <dig>  <cit> . in humans, rspo <dig> is the only ovarian gene known to be associated with complete xx sex reversal  <cit> , and in mice, it is at least partly required for wnt <dig> expression  <cit> . in fact, foxl <dig> and rspo <dig> are expressed independently of one another throughout fetal life  <cit> . thus, foxl <dig> and rspo <dig> regulate distinct female sex determining pathways and redundantly antagonize the action of testis determinants such as the transcription factor sox <dig> 

like its regulatory gene rspo <dig>  <cit> , wnt <dig> activation in the embryonic ovary is also independent of foxl <dig> throughout mouse fetal life . this indicates that studies of wnt <dig> and foxl <dig> can provide important complementary information about female sex determination and early ovary differentiation. we have compared ovarian transcriptomes of wild-type mice with mice lacking wnt <dig>  foxl <dig>  or both in the context of comparative analyses of all available microarray datasets for gonadal development and maturation. the results point toward highly specific candidate genes involved in gonadal sexual dimorphism, ovary aging, or both. the putative gene targets were in general consistent with further ovarian transcriptome analyses of ovaries deficient in oocytes , and were validated by corresponding changes in their expression in mouse embryos overexpressing transgenic foxl <dig> 

RESULTS
 <dig>  overview of gonadal development and maturation by principal component analysis: convergence of the maturing ovary to a testis-like profile
to focus on ovary maturation and aging in relation to gonadal development, we compared comprehensive gene expression profiles among a set of  <dig> microarray gonadal samples, of which  <dig> come from our study and  <dig> were reanalyzed from public databases deposited by  <dig> other laboratories in addition to ours . the samples spanned the life history of the mouse ovary and testis from the bipotential gonad to adulthood, including several mouse models of premature ovarian failure. in order to identify major expression profiles associated with distinct genotypes and developmental stages, we used principal component analysis , an unsupervised clustering method that does not rely on a priori class assignment. essentially, the method first identifies the group of genes with correlated expression profiles that account for the greatest amount of variance in the dataset , and then sequentially looks for additional co-expression profiles that are not correlated with the first group and account for decreasing amounts of variance .

in figure 1a, two distinct groups of correlated profiles, represented by the first two principal components , robustly discriminated gonadal samples into appropriate clusters of biological replicates, placing all testis  and ovary  samples in trajectories according to developmental stages . in figure 1b, colored symbols are added to show the relative positions of clusters at specific times when particular genes of importance were ablated singly or in combination. the  <dig> most variable genes were sufficient for good discrimination, but better resolution was obtained with longer lists, i.e., about  <dig>  top-ranking markers .

pc <dig>  the first principal component, i.e., the horizontal axis of figure  <dig>  represented ~40% of the total variance of the developmental gonadal marker genes. in the bipotential gonad, at e10–e <dig>  as expected, sets of genes were close by in ovary and testis. then, along pc <dig>  developing ovaries first diverged sharply from embryonic testes and subsequently moved back to values that were increasingly similar to newborn testes . the trend is thus in keeping with morphological indications that some features of follicle maturation involve testis differentiation-like processes .

the genes that showed sharp timing differences in their levels of expression along pc <dig>  included those involved in meiotic activity as well as other early ovary somatic cell markers  that had maximum values at the left of the pc <dig> axis. in addition, many top-scoring genes were involved in steroidogenesis and other early features of testis somatic cell differentiation , with maximum values at the right of the pc <dig> axis . furthermore, their pc <dig> positions in figure 1b illustrate that wnt4-/- ovaries and, to a lesser extent, foxl2-/-, kitwv/wv and lhx8-/- ovaries, mapped consistently closer to testis than did age-matched wild-type control ovaries. also, double mutants showed additive or synergistic effects on "movement toward testis". however, the relative contribution of reduced meiotic activity vs increased activity of steroidogenic genes and/or testis-like programs appears to differ in each type of mutant. indeed, newborn ovaries lacking kit, lhx <dig> or wnt <dig> lie relatively close together along pc <dig> in spite of their very different composition in germ cell numbers and their highly divergent degrees of sex reversal . consistent with distinct roles of meiotic and testis genes along the pc <dig> axis, an adult, germ cell-depleted, kitl-deficient testis sample mapped at the far right of the graph , i.e., nearer newborn testes than adult wild-type testes . thus, multiple pathways, ranging from control of meiosis to somatic cell sex reversal, are involved in pc <dig> 

in the case of the second axis  as well, multiple distinct pathways may be involved, but because they appear dissociated by pca, they are likely different and relatively autonomous from those accounting for pc <dig>  of interest, pc <dig> pointed toward many genes involved in follicle formation. for example, newborn ovaries, which are enriched in primordial follicles , were remarkably clustered at the top of pc <dig>  and several genes involved in early follicle development, i.e., lhx <dig>  figla, and sohlh <dig>  strongly correlated with this axis . however, follicle formation is only part of the underpinning of pc <dig>  because some newborn ovary samples  were also high-scoring even though they are known to be largely devoid of follicles.

overall, a representative "gonadal developmental transcriptome", trained on pre- and neonatal gonadal samples by pca, appears to discriminate the range of wild-type gonadal variation throughout life. in addition, pca suggests that dysgenetic ovaries activate programs that may represent the anticipation of a normal maturation/aging process and which may be a causative factor for associated pathology. however, pca does not discriminate between possible different contributions to this aging-like process, in particular the effects of meiotic germ cell depletion vs. the activation of bona fide testis-like pathways in somatic cells. in addition, the expression profiles of some genes with important gonadal functions, including foxl <dig> and sox <dig> , correlated only weakly with pca coordinates. in particular, they both ranked > 100th among genes that were ordered according to their degree of correlation with pc <dig> using the focus classifier . we infer that functional studies of ovary development and maturation may be more incisive if one includes systematic comparisons to testis samples in appropriately chosen developmental models. we thus present the molecular characterization of foxl2-null ovaries in the context of other models of ovarian dysgenesis, with special emphasis on the comparison of wild-type ovary and testis differentiation.

 <dig> . foxl <dig> knockout ovaries
foxl2-/- knockout ovaries have a histomorphologically normal appearance before birth. to detect molecular changes that may nonetheless predate postnatal anomalies, we sampled ovaries from prenatal and neonatal stages . these sampling times covered the period of greatest variation in gonadal developmental genes  and could minimize minor stage-specific changes or small shifts in developmental rate that might bias single time points with age-matched samples. to this end, linear contrasts implemented in the focus software work well  <cit> : the  <dig> top-ranking differentially expressed genes  are listed in the left column of table  <dig>  and the full lists are given in additional files 3a–b. we also obtained a combined gene list from standard pair-wise analyses, which was highly consistent but much less sensitive . in addition, we sampled for comparison wnt4-null ovaries at  <dig>  dpc, i.e., the stage at which partial sex reversal is well started but oocytes are still present and well differentiated.

the twenty top-ranking genes showing significant down- or up-regulation  in foxl2-null  ovaries relative to wild-type and in various biological contexts. from left to right, top-ranking genes are given for the following conditions: ovaries lacking only foxl <dig> ; shared between newborn ovaries lacking foxl <dig> and kit and those lacking foxl <dig> and wnt4; shared by all three models ; and shared between embryo-fetal ovaries lacking foxl <dig> and those lacking wnt <dig> alone . genes known to be expressed in vasculature or germ cells are underlined, neuronal genes have an asterisk, and testis  and other genes of interest  are in bold font.

we first adopted a strategy to identify highly specific  targets of foxl <dig>  as follows.

 <dig> . candidate genes for a primary role downstream of foxl2: profiling of compound knockout models involving foxl2
we reasoned that primary targets of foxl <dig> would tend to be differentially expressed in all ovaries lacking foxl <dig> either alone  or in combination with the ablation of wnt <dig> or kit. at birth, these various mouse models show very different morphology, cell composition, and endocrine function, and may thus provide a stringent framework for the identification of foxl2-dependent genes  <cit> . we compiled lists for genes that were differentially expressed in wnt4-/-foxl2-/- and kit-/-foxl2-/- double knockout ovaries relative to ovaries lacking wnt <dig> or kit function but harboring a functional foxl <dig> allele . we then intersected these lists with lists of genes associated with loss of foxl <dig> alone . that list comprises  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were systematically down or up-regulated in the absence of foxl <dig> . these lists thus include highly specific genes that may mediate foxl <dig> action, as follows.

inspection of the top genes in the lists  indicates that a large fraction of foxl2-dependent genes have no previously assigned role in gonadal development but have been associated with either neuronal or vascular development . some show female-specific upregulation in supporting or steroidogenic cells of embryonic gonads, including a transcription factor, odz <dig>  and several plasma transmembrane proteins, including plexin , the cadherin-domain containing calsyntenin  <dig> , and a leucine-rich repeat protein  . because some of these genes are involved in brain cortical patterning  <cit> , they might conceivably mediate the formation of the ovarian cortico-medullary axis, which is essential for follicle dynamics and reproductive longevity in mammals, and has no histoanatomical counterpart in the testis  <cit> .

top-ranking down-regulated genes also included grip <dig> , a nuclear repressor required for estrogen receptor alpha activity, and the gene encoding the akr1c <dig> aldo-keto reductase, which can metabolize the most potent natural androgen, dihydrotestosterone  <cit> . foxl2-dependence of these genes during embryonic development  might reflect an early role for foxl <dig> in regulating sex-specific steroidogenesis, which may be particularly important in higher mammals. furthermore, starting around  <dig>  dpc, upregulation of aromatase/cyp19a <dig> and the nuclear receptor nr5a2/lrh- <dig>  related to the master regulator of steroidogenesis, nr5a1/steroidogenic factor- <dig>  was strongly reduced in foxl2-null ovaries relative to controls.

additional hits further down the lists included sphingomyelin synthase sgms <dig> . it may be a positive regulator of primordial follicle formation and/or maintenance, given that loss of a sphingomyelinase, which performs the reverse metabolic reaction, was reported to enhance primordial follicle maintenance in mice  <cit> . another hit, encoding the cytoskeletal protein bicd <dig> that is related to a maternal fertility factor in drosophila, was enriched in primordial follicles of both oocytes and somatic cells . it may complement the action of a paralogue, bicd <dig>  that we have previously shown to be expressed in growing oocytes  <cit> .

expression levels were sometimes altered starting from  <dig>  dpc, as validated by real-time pcr . there the levels in e <dig> testis, first three bars at the left of each row, are compared to levels in the ovary collected at various developmental stages in wild-type and mutant mice; the corresponding microarray data  are concordant in every case. their relevance as candidate foxl <dig> targets was further substantiated by experiments in which an added foxl <dig> transgene was provided to wild-type mice .

the comparison of ovaries lacking foxl <dig> alone or in combination with either of two other genes therefore prioritizes candidate target genes that show sensitivity to foxl <dig> loss in the independent mouse models. candidate foxl <dig> targets may also be inferred by their response to multiple ovarian regulatory pathways, as follows.

 <dig> . candidate foxl <dig> target genes that respond to wnt <dig> or other ovarian pathways
we cross-compared all mouse models of ovarian dysgenesis that have been studied by microarray expression profiling to date. they include knockouts of the somatic genes emx <dig> and wnt <dig>  and the oocyte genes lhx <dig>  nobox, foxo <dig> and figla <dig>  <cit> . we reanalyzed the respective datasets compared to their respective controls . as expected for genes that are all required for fetal and newborn ovary development, the resulting lists of differentially expressed genes indicated similar alterations, reflecting synergistic effects. in particular, several well-known ovarian markers were comparably changed. inferred putative interactions are represented in figure  <dig>  along with others that involve important novel candidate targets of foxl <dig> . arrows indicate gene dependencies in terms of ranking by statistical significance in the microarray analyses; thus, the arrowhead points to gene that score among the top hits  in the list of genes affected by the gene from which the arrow originates.  for example, wnt <dig> and emx <dig> scored among the top hits in the respective lists of emx2- and wnt4-dependent genes, respectively, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . similarly, zona pellucida genes zp <dig> and zp <dig> were identified among the genes most strongly down-regulated in the absence of lhx <dig>  nobox and figla. in addition, thin and broken-line arrows indicate progressively lower degrees of dependence ; for instance, intermediate  dependencies include that of dax1/nr0b <dig> for wnt <dig>  a dependence that is known to be only partial  <cit> .

overall, figure  <dig> shows that in spite of a widespread network of positive correlations among well-known ovarian genes, they are affected to a different degree in distinct pathological conditions, with a quite clear-cut separation of the main candidate targets of somatic genes emx2/rspo1/wnt4/foxl <dig> from those of oocyte genes lhx8/nobox/figla/foxo <dig> . this is consistent with the proposal that somatic cells and oocytes may act on largely distinct though complementary pathways to promote ovary development. the relation of these genes to testis-like markers  was more complex .

we then extended the analysis from known markers to the complete gene lists obtained by microarray profiling, and thus determined their degree of overlap by chi-square . as expected, most lists were positively correlated with one another . nevertheless, one exceptional trend was notable: the lists of genes that depend on foxl <dig> and those dependent on wnt <dig> or emx <dig> were negatively correlated. in other words, genes that were up-regulated in the absence of wnt <dig> or emx <dig> were preferentially down-regulated in the absence of foxl <dig>  and vice versa . in particular, important developmental genes that were up in foxl2-null ovaries and down in wnt4-null ovaries included known or likely wnt4-dependent genes in the ovary .

concordance or discordance measured as the number of genes that showed the same or opposite directions of change pairwise comparisons of distinct knockout  models. the upper part of the table compares somatic genes among themselves and with oocyte genes, the lower part compares oocyte genes . bold font or underline indicate positive or negative correlations among lists, resp.

these differences were reflected in the relative distribution of several pathways listed in the gene ontology and kegg databases . in particular, glucose metabolism and protein synthesis were strongly enriched in foxl2-null ovaries but depleted in wnt4-null ovaries, respectively, whereas cell-cell interactions and neuronal-like pathways were depleted in foxl2-null ovaries but enriched in the absence of wnt <dig>  consistent with reduced cell-cell signaling, loss of foxl <dig> apparently led to reduced cell migratory activities, as inferred from the down-regulation of mapk and several cancer-related pathways that are presumably involved in ovarian tissue remodeling, as well as apoptotic factors that may have homeostatic actions in these processes. this is consistent with the notion that foxl <dig> is a critical determinant of ovary histogenesis, notably follicle formation.

columns from left to right: name of the pathway, number and proportion of genes that are down- or up-regulated in the respective knockout model, and corresponding p-value. all the pathways with fdr < 10% are shown. underlines indicate pathways that are enriched in the corresponding columns.

of interest, foxl <dig> loss also affected wnt-signaling. global alterations associated with oocyte genes were much less pronounced . consistent with a complementary action of oocytes and somatic cells, loss of oocyte genes led to a mixture of foxl2- and wnt4-associated features .

the results thus support our previous findings that foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> act independently during ovary differentiation, and further substantiate the notion that they may partly antagonize each other and/or regulate mutually competitive pathways. nevertheless, some known gonadal genes were top-ranking candidate targets of both foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  including kitl and fst . novel genes of potential interest that were strongly down-regulated in ovaries lacking foxl <dig> or wnt <dig>  and thus responsive to the sum of their actions, included gpc <dig> and akr1c <dig> . additional hits included several transcription factors, e.g., msx <dig>  grip <dig>  tcf <dig>  and foxp <dig> . although they scored relatively low, these genes were up-regulated in foxl2-transgenic mouse embryos . thus all of these genes, many of them expressed in somatic cells, now become candidates for a foxl2-dependent role in coordinating ovarian histogenesis and/or steroidogenesis.

 <dig> . anti-testis roles of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  and of other possible regulatory genes
we next focused on genes that were significantly up-regulated in ovaries lacking foxl <dig> alone or in combination with kit or wnt <dig>  they included both ovarian and testis genes. the ovarian genes included nr0b1/dax <dig>  wnt <dig> and rspo <dig> as well as novel candidates, such as zbtb7c; the testis genes included sox <dig>  dhh, dmrt <dig>  and cyp26b <dig> . it is notable that these and other top-scoring ovarian and testis genes have important roles in sex determination and/or early sexual dimorphism . thus, in the absence of foxl <dig>  the exacerbation of foxl2-independent ovarian pathways coincided with the partial de-repression of testis-like genes. this started during embryonic development, even in single knockout ovaries that are morphologically normal until birth . similarly, and consistent with much earlier onset of morphological anomalies, wnt4-null single knockout ovaries showed de-repression of some testis genes, e.g., dhh and inhbb; and although foxl <dig> was not up-regulated in these dysgenetic ovaries by whole-organ microarray , its levels remained high compared to other ovarian genes and were increased by real-time pcr . in addition, foxl <dig> protein expression was strongly detected in the persisting cord-like and follicle-like structures .

the expression levels of some early testis-like genes showed opposite directions of change in the absence of distinct ovarian genes. in particular, inhbb was up in fetal ovaries lacking either wnt <dig> or foxl <dig>  but down in ovaries lacking the oocyte gene lhx <dig> and in the most masculinized phenotype that we have studied, i.e., wnt4-/-foxl2-/- double knockout newborn ovaries . similarly, robo <dig>  which is up-regulated in wnt4-null ovaries , showed reduced levels in ovaries lacking foxl <dig> . therefore, regulation of these testis-like genes, and their impact on the ovarian phenotype, may depend on the conditional interactions of multiple ovarian factors.

similar to loss of foxl <dig> or wnt <dig>  loss of lhx <dig> led to up-regulation of a few genes that are normally expressed in testes . however, this effect did not extend to genes known to be involved in testis sex determination, suggesting that foxl2- and wnt4-null ovaries are better suited to identify novel anti-testis genes.

to identify novel candidate anti-testis genes with a "master" regulatory role comparable to foxl <dig> or wnt <dig>  we used a simple statistical approach  that detects genes that are both testis-depleted and up- or partially down-regulated in the dysgenetic ovary relative to the wild-type ovary. the gene candidates for "independent anti-testis" gene action in the foxl2-null or wnt4-null ovaries are listed in additional files 9a–c, with the top-ranking hits given in table  <dig>  as expected as an internal control, consistent with their relative independence  <cit> , wnt <dig> was top-ranking in foxl2-null ovaries, and foxl <dig> in wnt4-null ovaries. in addition, the overlap between the two lists detected rspo <dig>  <cit>  and numerous oocyte genes as female-enriched and independent of both wnt <dig> and foxl <dig> . in addition, several other genes were expressed in somatic cells, i.e., runx <dig>  irx <dig>  a foxl2-antisense transcript, wnt9a, and zbtb7c. the relative levels of all of them were validated by multiple microarray probe sets and/or by real-time pcr . these genes may thus have a role in autonomous pathways capable of antagonizing testis differentiation independently of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> 

this list includes candidate genes for an autonomous anti-testis role relative to both foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> 

 <dig>  foxl <dig> transgenic mice
we used foxl2-transgenics to see if candidate foxl <dig> targets inferred from the microarray analyses presented above were indeed responsive to foxl <dig> . as expected, foxl <dig> expression was absent or at background levels in gonads from xy wildtype embryos. but in xy transgenic embryos, gonadal levels of foxl <dig> were similar to wildtype ovaries, and xx transgenic ovaries showed even stronger expression . this correlated with sex-specific effects, as follows.

all female markers normally up-regulated during early ovarian differentiation, whether sexually dimorphic or not, were expressed at consistently higher levels in  <dig>  dpc foxl2-transgenic ovaries relative to wild-type littermates . that included rspo <dig>  fst, wnt <dig>  dax1/nr0b <dig> and zbtb7c. in xx embryos, up-regulation overtly extended to the meiotic markers sycp <dig> and dmc1h. the status of foxl <dig> candidate targets inferred from the microarray analysis of foxl <dig> knockout mice is thereby validated, and there are hints of feed-forward interactions with foxl2-independent genes, such as wnt <dig>  rspo <dig> and zbtb7c .

furthermore, several ovarian genes were up-regulated to various extents in  <dig>  dpc transgenic xy gonads, which contained severely disorganized seminiferous tubules  <cit> . these changes are consistent with the induction of a limited degree of male-to-female sex reversal in foxl <dig> transgenics. among the statistically significant genes were some expressed in meiotic germ cells  and others in somatic cells, i.e., zbtb7c, clstn <dig>  grip <dig>  lrrc <dig> and aromatase . in particular, induction of aromatase and clstn <dig> in foxl <dig> transgenic xy gonads was remarkably strong relative to testes . this is in agreement with previous in vitro studies indicating that foxl <dig> can transactivate the aromatase promoter . conversely,  <dig>  dpc foxl2-transgenic xy gonads showed reduced expression of the male sex determining genes sox <dig> and dhh. in addition, strong repression was seen for downstream embryonic testis-specific genes of endocrine relevance . repression was also strikingly pronounced for the two male germ cell markers tested, xmr and oct <dig>  which were reduced 26- and 4-fold, respectively .

a few results were unanticipated; e.g., the foxl <dig> transgene down-regulated the expression of wnt <dig> and dax1/nr0b <dig> while increasing expression of inhbb. these unanticipated effects may result from an exacerbation of the inferred partial antagonism between foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  and possibly relate to the complex responses shown by inhbb attendant on the loss of various ovary genes alone or in combination . in any case, the preponderance of the data provide independent support for an early anti-testis action of foxl <dig> – whether by delaying development of xy gonads or by promoting male-to-female sex reversal. most important, the foxl2-mediated disruptive effects, including the suppression of wnt <dig>  were confined to xy embryos. the notion of a specific and early sexually dimorphic role for foxl <dig> is thereby supported.

 <dig>  gene dosage effects in foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries
loss of a single copy of foxl <dig> might represent a model for the heterozygous foxl <dig> mutations that affect patients. we looked at the extent to which heterozygotes expressed molecular anomalies like those seen in foxl2-null ovaries. we focused on two stages,  <dig>  dpc and  <dig> dpn , because the corresponding foxl2-null ovaries showed well-differentiated morphological states that were either normal or well engaged in abnormal development.

in order to identify molecular anomalies associated with heterozygous loss of function, we generated oocyte- vs somatic cell gene lists enriched in fetal vs postnatal ovaries of heterozygous mice. the lists were based on published microarray data, supplemented by a list of the probes for known testis determining genes . we then evaluated differential enrichment in these lists by a sensitive algorithm that detects non-random distributions in pair-wise comparisons .

we first tested testis-determining genes , which, as a group, were significantly up-regulated in  <dig>  dpc foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries relative to wild-type , with levels that were comparable to those in foxl2-null ovaries . these findings raise the possibility that loss of a single allele of foxl <dig> may be sufficient for a significant though weak derepression of testis genes in the fetal mouse ovary. nevertheless, this effect appeared to be transient. indeed, in  <dig> dpn foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries, the microarrays evinced no significant trend toward the expression of testis markers . this contrasted with foxl2-null ovaries, which, consistent with our previous studies showing delayed postnatal oocyte growth and partial sex reversal , showed a significant enrichment of testis determining genes at  <dig> dpn .

consistent with ongoing sex reversal,  <dig> dpn foxl2-null ovaries also showed a sharp extensive repression of postnatal oocyte and somatic follicle cell markers compared to both foxl2+/- heterozygous and wild-type ovaries . compared to foxl2-null ovaries, foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries exhibited normal expression of oocyte growth genes but showed clear dosage effects for somatic follicle markers. the latter were inhibited almost as much in heterozygotic ovaries as in foxl2-null ovaries compared to wild-type . furthermore, as expected for a dosage-related response, the inhibition in heterozygous ovaries was less strong than in foxl2-null ovaries . top-scoring genes were often known or likely to be involved in early steps of follicle growth, i.e., inhba, inhbb, cyp11a1/p450ssc, cyp17a <dig>  nr5a <dig> , as well as novel genes with a likely role in somatic cells, e.g., odz <dig> . several of these genes are known to be involved in steroidogenesis. thus, in the absence of one foxl <dig> allele, strong dosage effects in somatic follicle growth genes contrasted sharply with the normal expression of oocyte growth genes.

in addition, in  <dig>  dpc and  <dig> dpn foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries, we found significant up-regulation of markers for fetal ovary development, independent of whether they were germline- or somatic cell-enriched . this suggests that foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries undergo a developmental delay starting in fetal life.

discussion
we have analyzed mouse ovary development and maturation based on comparative gene expression profiling of wild-type stages and pathological conditions. first, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm, pca, to show that gonadal developmental genes can discriminate stages of ovarian differentiation and maturation throughout life. however, sexual dimorphism was resolved only partly, i.e., conditional on developmental time. thus, as a second, supervised approach, we focused on foxl2-null ovaries.

cellular models are currently lacking for both sex determination and follicle formation. whole-organ studies provide an alternative route to investigate underlying developmental processes, which involve complex interactions of cell types. however, whole-organ studies are particularly sensitive to biological confounds such as overt changes in cell-type composition. to circumvent such effects, we compared conditions that were associated with highly divergent ovarian phenotypes but shared a common genotype, i.e., loss of foxl <dig> or wnt <dig> alone or foxl <dig> in combination with kit or wnt <dig> . indeed, largely distinct cell types are affected in the null ovaries that lack foxl <dig>  kit or wnt <dig> . it is thus unlikely that secondary and conditional targets of foxl <dig> would be similarly affected by chance in the very different phenotypes associated with these three models of ovarian dysgenesis. thus, the lists resulting from a series of distinct dysgenetic ovary models involving loss of foxl <dig> should be enriched in primary targets of this gene. similar considerations led us to search for common putative targets of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  as their deletion induces somewhat complementary phenotypes . the analysis enables us to suggest novel genetic interactions and ovarian genes that are either candidate targets or act independently of foxl <dig> and wnt <dig>  results were validates by foxl <dig> overexpression studies and the analysis was extended to foxl2+/- heterozygotes .

the data lead to four main inferences.

1) partial convergence of somatic transcriptomes in maturing ovary and testis
one inference from the present analysis is that by unsupervised principal component analysis , meiotic activity and some testis-related pathways  may be dissociated from other pathways that include follicle formation , as they map along two different axes . this suggests that two major pathways, one more closely related to germ cell differentiation and the other to somatic cell histogenesis, may act autonomously during gonadal development. this is consistent with some current theories on the mechanisms of sexual dimorphism; but the range of autonomous  pathways may be greater than two, as indicated by our supervised analyses 

a second inference from pca is that a large fraction of the mouse ovarian developmental transcriptome becomes progressively similar to testis after birth. as shown in figure 1a, pca discriminates fetal and newborn ovaries from wild-type adult gonads, which cluster with fetal-newborn testes along pc <dig>  this supports accumulating evidence for a link between ovary maturation and a predisposition of this organ to form testis-like tissues  <cit> . we found that the shift toward testes was accelerated in several knockout or mutant ovary models compared to age-matched wild-type ovaries . however, pca did not discriminate between contributions to this pattern from the loss of meiotic activity or from the activation of testis-like pathways expressed in somatic cells. in addition, some critical gonadal genes correlated only poorly with pca coordinates. foxl <dig> and sox <dig> were notable examples. pca failed to detect their standing as the current best markers for wild-type female and male supporting cells, exemplified by their striking pattern of mutually exclusive expression in a wide range of different conditions involving partial sex-reversal  <cit> . rather than conferring variable degrees of predisposition to sex reversal, foxl <dig> and sox <dig> seem to act as all-or-none switches, and their mutual antagonism may be determinative in sex determination  <cit> . we further tested this proposal by supervised analyses of the foxl2-null ovary transcriptome.

2) specific gene candidate targets of foxl <dig> and comparison of ovaries lacking foxl <dig> vs other early ovarian factors
by comparing single and compound knockout ovaries lacking foxl <dig>  we have identified and ranked  <dig> candidate genes for a specific role downstream of foxl <dig> . kegg pathway analysis indicated that in foxl2-null fetal ovaries, neuronal-like pathways, migratory activity and cell-cell interactions were reduced, whereas glucose metabolism and protein synthesis were increased . of note, wnt4-null ovaries showed a largely inverse metabolic profile, and we observed a significant negative correlation between the inferred candidate target genes of wnt <dig> and foxl <dig> . this contrasts with results when several other ovarian genes are ablated. those mouse models show largely positive correlations, though the strength of dependence of the shared candidate targets varies, notably between somatic genes and oocyte genes . thus, the widely divergent molecular anomalies observed in wnt <dig> and foxl2-null fetal ovaries provide an entry point to the mechanisms underlying the partly autonomous, complementary roles of these genes in ovary development.

consistent with kegg results, several genes that are known to be expressed by neurons and vascular cells in other systems, e.g., calstn <dig>  odz <dig> and lrrc <dig>  were among the most sensitive candidate foxl <dig> targets . in addition, some steroidogenesis-related genes  were also affected very early by loss of foxl <dig>  this early effect is striking considering that in the mouse ovary, active steroidogenesis occurs postnatally. steroidogenesis is completely repressed in postnatal foxl2-null mouse ovaries  <cit>  and steroidogenic genes are strongly affected in foxl <dig> transgenic mouse embryos . some additional foxl2-dependent genes, expressed in both somatic cells and oocytes, may be associated with novel ovarian functions, including sgms <dig> and bicd <dig> .

comparison of the positive candidate targets shared by foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> pointed to additional genes that may integrate the outputs of the respective largely independent pathways . they include the genes encoding the well-known kit ligand, kitl, the wnt4-effector follistatin, the proteoglycan gpc <dig>  and several other candidate genes for novel roles in ovary development, i.e., msx <dig>  grip <dig>  tcf <dig>  and foxp <dig> . all of these genes, many of them expressed in somatic cells, are enriched in fetal wild-type ovaries compared to testis and become candidates for a role in coordinating ovarian histogenesis and/or steroidogenesis.

novel ovarian candidate target genes that we inferred to be positively regulated by foxl <dig> from the comparison of single and double knockout mice were assessed in foxl <dig> transgenic embryos. all were up-regulated in xx gonads, with occasional, limited upregulation in xy gonads as well . these findings confirm the ability of the microarray analysis to detect bona fide targets of foxl <dig>  independent of whether foxl <dig> regulatory action is direct or indirect. the great majority of these genes had been missed in previous less complete in vitro microarray studies . the expectation that genes up-regulated by foxl <dig> in vitro would likely be down-regulated in the foxl2-null ovaries , and vice-versa , was met only to some extent . nevertheless, the overlapping hits included several biologically validated or promising genes, e.g., nr5a <dig>  zbtb7c, mmp <dig> and inhbb . in short, even though in vitro data included a plethora of hits that appear unrelated to the in vivo situation, some genes that overlap do have known or putatively important roles in vivo. this suggests that in vitro models may provide useful information in the study of gonadal development, though extensive filtering by comparison to in vivo data is required.

overall, our foxl <dig> transgenic model shows a generalized induction of ovary markers in xx embryos and a severe perturbation of testis markers in xy embryos, underlining a sex-specific action of foxl <dig>  the strongest effects of the foxl <dig> transgene in xy embryonic gonads involved male germ cell genes and sexually dimorphic steroidogenic factors . nevertheless, the earliest gonadal defects involving sex reveral that are observed in female steroidogenesis-deficient mice  occur around the time of puberty . thus, aromatase and estrogen action can only partly account for foxl <dig> action, and presumably only at later stages during ovary development and maturation. the early branches of the foxl <dig> pathway remain to be characterized more fully.

3) early embryonic action of foxl2
a striking result from the microarray analysis is the early time at which foxl2-null ovaries showed significant anomalies, i.e., by  <dig>  dpc, the time at which germ cells commit to the oocyte fate in mice. some ovarian genes  were down-regulated and some ovarian and testis-like genes were consistently up-regulated . thus, foxl2-null ovaries show subtle features of partial sex reversal starting during early embryonic development. nevertheless, levels of testis genes were low in prenatal foxl2-null mouse ovaries . this may explain why we previously failed to detect sox <dig> protein expression at these stages  <cit> . in any case, the early, reproducible transcriptional dysregulation of a number of testis and ovarian genes suggests that the female sex determination program is partly impaired in embryonic ovaries that lack foxl <dig>  these subtle alterations may predispose to overt molecular sex reversal, which occurs postnatally in the supporting cell lineage of foxl2-null ovaries, and is accelerated and extends to all other cell types in ovaries lacking both wnt <dig> and foxl <dig> . the data also suggest widespread antagonistic or competitive interactions between foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> during fetal development .

the molecular anomalies detected in foxl2-/- single knockout ovaries occur earlier than the earliest time of onset of histological sex reversal reported in mouse models so far . instead, rspo <dig> mutations and foxl <dig> downregulation in humans and goats, respectively, are associated with much earlier, nearly complete forms of female-to-male sex reversal  <cit> .

to reconcile differences among species, one possibility infers that other genes, possibly expressed in oocytes  <cit> , may be involved in female sex determination, and some might well be mouse-specific. alternatively, as we have previously suggested, several autonomous ovarian gene pathways conjointly repress testis differentiation, but their autonomy may be more pronounced in mice than in higher mammals  <cit> .

we infer several candidate anti-testis genes that are expressed independently of both foxl <dig> and wnt <dig> by comparing gene expression patterns associated with the partial ovary-to-testis sex reversal  to both testis and wild-type ovary profiles. some of these candidate anti-testis genes have been partially characterized previously – e.g., wnt9a and irx <dig> , whereas others are novel, e.g., zbtb7c . their function should become clearer with ablation studies to determine their interactions, with particular attention to any dependence on rspo <dig>  <cit> . genes with restricted gonadal expression also become candidates for possible involvement, via constitutive mutations, in human patients affected by non-syndromic forms of  <dig>  xx sex reversal or premature ovarian failure.

4) dosage effects in foxl2-/+ heterozygotes
a fourth inference from the analyses is that anomalies in foxl2+/- heterozygous ovaries were milder but similar to foxl2-null ovaries. they included reduced expression of follicle genes, notably involved in steroidogenesis, and the transient coexpression of some fetal ovary and testis genes at levels higher than normal. these features suggest that loss of one foxl <dig> allele might decrease the stability of ovary sex determination, and might possibly be implicated in the etiology of premature ovarian failure in heterozygous foxl2+/- human patients  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the connection between the mechanisms of follicle formation and female reproductive competence in mammals has long been appreciated  <cit> , but an involvement of embryonic anti-testis genes has only recently been suggested. among the known anti-testis genes, foxl <dig> has a special status because it is required in supporting cells throughout ovarian development , and its continuous expression in postnatal primordial follicles suggests a possible role in the maintenance of female reproductive capacity  <cit> . however, the comprehensive analysis of available microarrays adds to the weight of evidence that additional gene pathways that may have a more limited action in time, independently promote ovarian differentiation and repress the alternative testis fate. they include at least one pathway involving rspo <dig> and wnt <dig> as well as novel candidate factors . the identification of the full range of independent anti-testis genes and their most specific targets, as inferred from appropriate series of partly overlapping combinations of mutant genotypes, now becomes a focus for further investigation.
