BACKGROUND
members of the pyhin protein family have recently come to prominence as receptors mediating the detection of foreign dna and initiating innate immune responses. absent in melanoma  <dig>  binds dna in the cytosol of macrophages and mediates activation of the inflammasome pathway  <cit> . a second family member, p <dig>  binds to cytosolic dna and antagonises this pathway  <cit> . the inflammasome is a protein complex initiating activation of the protease precursor procaspase  <dig>  active caspase  <dig> cleaves proil-1β and proil- <dig> prior to their secretion as active inflammatory cytokines, and also leads to rapid lytic cell death termed “pyroptosis”  <cit> . aim2-mediated responses are elicited by viruses such as mouse cytomegalovirus  and vaccinia, the cytosolic bacteria francisella tularensis and listeria monocytogenes, and even extracellular bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . aim <dig> was necessary for effective control of francisella tularensis and mcmv infection of mice  <cit> .

another pyhin family member, human ifi <dig>  was shown to mediate inflammasome responses to kaposi’s sarcoma virus dna in the nucleus  <cit> . infection led to increased nuclear colocalisation of ifi <dig> with asc, followed by emigration of both factors into the perinuclear region. ifi <dig> but not aim <dig> knockdown decreased procaspase- <dig> cleavage in response to viral infection. on the other hand, ifi <dig> and mouse pyhin protein p <dig> were found to play a role in the recognition of foreign dna leading to induction of interferon-β , which is a pathway distinct from the inflammasome  <cit> . induction of ifn-β by cytosolic dna requires the adapter protein sting , and subsequent activation of tank-binding kinase  <dig>  leading to phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor- <dig>   <cit> . ifi <dig> is not the only contender for such a role in dna recognition, as recent work suggests that the unrelated helicase protein ddx <dig> is the dna-binding protein primarily required for the early induction of signalling leading to ifn-β production whilst ifi16-mediated responses to dna may prolong the induction of ifn-β later in the response  <cit> . both ifi <dig> and ddx <dig> were reported to bind to sting  <cit> . overall, study of the pyhin gene family has been hampered by the complexity of the family in mouse, and a lack of understanding of orthology between mouse and human genes.

the pyhin genes were identified as a cluster on mouse and human chromosome  <dig> and were named mouse ifi <dig>   <cit>  and human hin- <dig>   <cit> . they have more recently been annotated as the “pyhin” family, acknowledging the defining features of an n-terminal pyrin domain and c-terminal hin domain. there are four human pyhin proteins: ifi <dig>   <cit> , mnda   <cit> , aim <dig>  <cit>  and ifix   <cit> . publications have so far detailed seven mouse proteins p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  aim2/p <dig>  and mndal  as well as a number of predicted proteins  <cit> . family members are predominantly nuclear proteins, some with defined nuclear localisation signals  <cit> . there is potential for regulated localisation, since acetylation of the nuclear localisation signal of ifi <dig> led to its cytosolic accumulation  <cit> . some family members have characterised nuclear export sequences  <cit> , suggesting they may shuttle in and out of the nucleus. in contrast, p <dig> and aim <dig> lack nuclear localisation signals and reside in the cytoplasm of untreated cells  <cit> , consistent with the role of aim <dig> and p <dig> in the recognition of cytosolic dna. p <dig> is also reported to have cytoplasmic location  <cit> .

prior to the finding that members of the family function in pathogen recognition, publications focused on roles in cell growth and cell cycle control, tumour suppression, apoptosis, dna damage response, senescence, muscle and myeloid differentiation and autoimmunity  <cit> . these functions are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere  <cit> . there is as yet limited insight into the specific molecular roles of the proteins in these diverse functions. various family members have been found to bind tumour suppressors such as p <dig>  brca <dig>  and retinoblastoma protein  <cit> , supportive of roles in cell cycle regulation, dna repair and apoptosis. interactions with a range of transcription factors and signalling molecules are also reported  <cit> . the novel roles being uncovered for pyhin proteins in host defence now provide relevance for the long-established interferon-inducibility of these genes. consistent with viral need to evade detection, several viral proteins are characterised to bind pyhin family members  <cit> .

the pyhin proteins are defined by the possession of one or two 200-amino acid hin domains at the c terminus, and a pyrin domain at the n terminus  <cit> . the roles of the hin and pyrin domains are well established for aim2-mediated inflammasome responses  <cit> . aim <dig> recognises dna via its hin domain, and then recruits the inflammasome adapter protein asc  via homotypic interaction of pyrin domains. asc itself recruits procaspase  <dig> via its caspase recruitment domain , resulting in intermolecular cleavage to give active caspase  <dig>  the pyrin domain of aim <dig> can therefore be considered the effector domain eliciting inflammasome formation. pyrin domains  are also found in other proteins involved in inflammasome formation, such as nod-like receptors. they are part of the death domain superfamily which also includes the death domain, death effector domain, and card  <cit> . death domains form six-helix bundles and are frequently involved in recruitment of proteins in apoptotic and inflammatory responses through homotypic interactions.

the hin domain is unique to the pyhin family, and three distinct sequence classes, hin-a, -b, and -c, have been defined  <cit> . the hin domain was predicted to combine two oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding -folds  <cit> . ob-folds are five-stranded β-barrel structures found in a number of single stranded dna -binding proteins such as replication protein a and breast cancer  <dig>  early onset . the ob-fold prediction is now supported by the crystal structures of the hin domains of ifi <dig> and aim <dig>  <cit> . the structure of double stranded  dna-bound proteins  <cit>  showed that interaction between the hin domains and dna was primarily by electrostatic interaction with the sugar-phosphate backbone, explaining the dna sequence-independent responses to cytosolic dna. this work also suggested that in the absence of dna, the pyrin domain is bound to the hin domain in an autoinhibited state. unterholzner et al. showed that the tandem hin domains of ifi <dig> were more effective in dna binding than its single hin-b domain, with the hin-a domain alone being ineffective  <cit> . interestingly, recent work showed that ifi <dig> had a preference for binding cruciform structure dna  <cit> . native mouse p <dig>  which also has two hin domains, strictly bound to dsdna and not ssdna  <cit> , and biological responses mediated via aim <dig> are dependent on dsdna, and are not elicited by ssdna  <cit> . beyond this, whether the hin domains of different pyhin family members have any specificity for particular dna sequences or structures remains to be established.

the presence of four pyhin family members in human has been known for a number of years, but the number of predicted mouse genes has increased with each new release of the mouse genome. in this paper, we describe the mouse, human and rat gene loci and proteins, address the issue of orthology between mouse and human genes and expression of the many mouse genes, and examine the evolution of the gene family within mammals. this provides a picture of a rapidly evolving locus with vastly different gene repertoires in different mammalian species and even within mouse strains. phylogenetic analysis shows a clear distinction between aim <dig> and other family members, suggesting divergence in function. surprisingly, given the important role for aim <dig> in host defence in mouse, aim <dig> appears only as a pseudogene in a number of different lineages, and appears to have been lost from genomes on several independent occasions during evolution.

RESULTS
the pyhin gene locus in mouse
the pyhin gene cluster is found in a syntenic region in many mammals, located between the cell adhesion molecule  <dig>  gene and a collection of olfactory receptors and spectrin alpha chain , on chromosome 1q band h <dig> in mouse, 1q <dig> in human, and 13q <dig> in rat . on the basis of predicted genes and cdna sequences, we pcr-cloned the open reading frames of  <dig> factors mapping to the locus from c57bl/ <dig> splenic cdna   or cdna from raw <dig> cell line  and obtained cdna for ifi <dig> from ricky johnstone . a fourteenth predicted gene [mgi: gm <dig> can be discerned but there is only sparse est evidence supporting its expression, compared with other genes. it encodes an intact open reading frame, and differs from ifi <dig> in only  <dig> amino acids out of  <dig>  hence we have here termed it ifi203´. the gene denoted here ifi <dig>  identified by ludlow et al. <cit>  appears identical with ifi <dig>  for which a partial genomic dna sequence had been published  <cit> . although our cloned cdna for ifi <dig> encodes a protein without a hin domain, there is a hin domain encoded by dna immediately downstream of ifi <dig> , which is represented in est databases. thus a hin-containing splice variant of ifi <dig> may exist.

divergence of the locus between mouse strains
the pyhin gene locus is divergent in different mouse strains. the region encoding mndal/ifi <dig> is absent in a number of related mouse strains including dba/2j, akr/n, and nzb/binj  <cit> . part of ifi <dig> is also missing in dba  <cit> , explaining the lack of ifi <dig> mrna in that strain  <cit> . zhang et al. <cit>  presented an arrangement of genes in the locus generated from two overlapping bac sequences, one from c57bl/ <dig> and one from 129x1/svj. this presents a model not consistent with the current c57bl/ <dig> genome, and suggests that the  <dig> strain may be missing the genes ifi <dig> and ifi <dig> which lie between mndal/ifi <dig> and ifi <dig> in c57bl/ <dig> . in contradiction to this, an earlier map of the  <dig> strain mouse locus showed two extra duplications of ifi <dig> <cit> , one of which may be ifi203´ . in addition, there are two ifi <dig> genes and a pseudogene in the  <dig> mouse genome, designated ifi202ab and c <cit> , but only one ifi <dig> gene in c57bl/ <dig> , which has a number of minor sequence variations from the published ifi202a and b <cit> . thus it seems that in the mouse lineage, the pyhin locus has been subject to frequent amplification and rearrangement.

human and rat pyhin loci
the human locus is simpler, with  <dig> identified genes . the human aim <dig> gene, like mouse aim <dig>  lies in the reverse orientation to other genes at one end of the gene cluster near the cadm <dig> gene. interestingly, the human locus may also be prone to duplications, as a recent paper reports copy-number variation, including within the ifi <dig> gene, in the human population  <cit> . the rat genome is incomplete, with gaps remaining within the locus. there are currently four identifiable genes with both pyrin and hin domains  and an isolated pyrin domain  . est databases support the expression of all the rat genes except rhin <dig> 

gene nomenclature
pyhin gene and protein nomenclature has been confused over the years due to the similarity between genes. early papers on a family member termed d <dig>  <cit>  show sequence from the ifi <dig> gene, although this name also seems to have been used for the ifi <dig> gene, which is very similar. what we have termed ifi <dig> here has been annotated as ifi205b in a recent review  <cit> . however, the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids encoded by ifi <dig> are more closely related to ifi <dig> , perhaps indicating recent gene conversion . consequently, we favour independent names for these genes. new names for genes have also been introduced during genome annotation on the basis of some inter-species sequence similarities. we show later in this paper that apart from aim <dig> there are no direct orthologues between mouse and human. thus, we propose the simple numbering for mouse genes indicated in table  <dig> 

the mouse, human and rat protein families
the domain organisation inferred from cdna sequences reveals that whilst most proteins have a pyrin domain at the n terminus and a c-terminal hin domain, there are also cdnas coding for proteins with no pyrin domain , with two hin domains  and no hin domains  . a number of splice variants exist for ifi <dig>  ifix and ifi <dig>  detailed elsewhere  <cit> . we have identified a splice variant of mouse aim <dig> that would generate a pyrin-only protein, termed here aim2b .

identification of pyhin genes in a range of species
rigorous tblastn and iterative psi-blast searches for pyhin proteins in vertebrates revealed no trace of hin domains outside of mammals, nor any other closely related domains. although structural evidence suggests the hin domain may have evolved from a dna-binding ob-fold  <cit> , there is now little primary sequence homology between hin and other dna-binding domains. pyhin pyrin domains have some sequence similarity to pyrin domains found in nod-like receptor proteins. our searches in non-mammals using pyhin pyrin domains returned only domains from these other protein families. tblastn searches in marsupials found only a single pyhin coding sequence in each of opossum, tasmanian devil and wallaby. thus, at least one pyhin gene existed prior to the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals. there is no evidence of any such gene in the platypus genome . whether this truly reflects an absence in monotremes, or incomplete genome sequence, remains to be established. pyhin gene sequences were identified in all major groups of mammals, except bats.

phylogenetic analysis supports hin domain subtypes
to examine the evolution of the gene cluster during mammalian radiation, we used sequences from species in each of the major clades on the mammalian species tree . evident shuffling of pyrin and hin domain coding sequences between genes in mouse and in other species, as well as highly variable sequences in the region between pyrin and hin domains meant that phylogenetic analyses of the protein sequences as a whole were not informative. consequently, pyrin and hin domains were used separately for analysis, with alignments of these domains provided in additional file 3: figure s <dig> and additional file 4: figure s <dig>  within the species shown, we extracted all the available complete  hin domain sequences.

trees were generated by bayesian as well as maximum likelihood approaches. a hin domain phylogenetic tree derived from bayesian analysis is shown in figure  <dig>  rooted with marsupial sequences. overall, the tree topology was very similar by the two methods as indicated in figure  <dig>  this revealed three distinct clades of placental mammal sequences, consistent with previous assignment of hin-a, hin-b and hin-c type domains  <cit> . the marsupial sequences cluster separately, and we have termed these hin-d. the hin-c domain is uniquely found in aim2-like sequences, present at a maximum of one copy in each genome. a clear difference in the role of hin-a, -b, and -c domains is yet to be established, although recombinantly expressed ifi <dig> hin-a and hin-b domains differ in their ability to bind dna  <cit> . the maintenance of distinct hin-a and hin-b sequences amongst diverse species suggests that they may recognise different structures or sequences of dna, and consequently be optimal for recognition of distinct classes of pathogens. notable from this analysis is the branch length for mouse p <dig> hin domains, particularly the hin-b domain, indicating a rapid divergence from other mouse hin domains.

pyrin domain phylogeny shows the distinct nature of aim2
similar approaches were taken to generate phylogenetic trees for pyhin pyrin domains, rooted with marsupial sequences. the resolution of these trees was limited by the short sequence of the pyrin domain . however, the majority of clades were predicted similarly by bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, as indicated in figure  <dig>  the major result is the demonstration of two markedly separate clades amongst the placental mammal proteins, one containing aim <dig> orthologues, and another encompassing all other  pyhins . the large divergence between the aim <dig> and ifi sequences is evident by the long branch lengths separating these clades.

the maintenance of such a distinct pyrin domain in aim <dig> suggests it has a different role from that of the other pyhin proteins. divergence of aim <dig> and ifi pyrin domains occurred prior to placental mammal speciation, since diverse mammalian species have maintained distinct aim <dig> and ifi pyrin sequences. in aim <dig>  the hin domain binds dna and the pyrin domain recruits asc and nucleates the formation of the dna inflammasome. earlier results suggested that the aim <dig> pyrin domain, but not other human pyhin factors, could bind asc  <cit> . recent work suggests that ifi <dig> binds viral dna in the nucleus and initiates inflammasome responses  <cit> , although a direct interaction with asc has not been demonstrated. further work to examine proteins interacting with the ifi pyrin domains is warranted.

amongst the non-aim <dig> sequences, the pyrin tree topology  is markedly different from the hin tree . there is no distinction between the pyrin domains of hin-a and hin-b containing proteins. in some cases, there has been evident gene conversion or domain shuffling which has maintained similarity of pyrin domain sequences within a species. for example, the two dog pyrin sequences are closely related, although one dog gene contains a hin-a and one a hin-b.

multiple species have aim <dig> pseudogenes
aim <dig> is required for optimal defence against some viral and bacterial pathogens in mouse  <cit> . in contrast to the variable expansions of the other pyhin family members, we have observed aim <dig> in only one copy per genome. surprisingly, we found no intact aim <dig>  but evidence for an aim <dig> pseudogene in cow, llama, dolphin and sheep  as well as elephant and dog . these sequences all encode hin-c, more similar to aim <dig> than other human ifi proteins , but contain frame shifts and/or multiple stop codons. cow, llama, dolphin and sheep are all part of the cetartiodactyla  <cit> , and there may have been basal loss of aim <dig> in the evolution of this clade . pig also falls within this group, and we could find no discernible aim <dig> gene or pseudogene sequence within the available pig genome , which has four-fold coverage. horse appears to have an intact aim <dig> gene, whilst dog has a pseudogene. the phylogenetic relationship between horse, dog and the cetartiodactyla is controversial  <cit> , and an independent origin for the dog pseudogene, as shown in figure  <dig>  cannot be confirmed. however, generation of the elephant pseudogene must have been an independent event . it cannot be excluded that further sequencing may reveal intact aim <dig> in some of these species. however, the neighbouring cadm <dig> gene can be reliably identified in the published genomes of all these species except sheep, which has relatively low coverage. although aim <dig> is of demonstrated importance in mouse  <cit> , the probable loss of aim <dig> in some species suggests they have evolved alternate mechanisms to cope with dna viruses and intracellular bacteria.

lineage-specific gene family expansions
there are variable expansions of hin-a and hin-b encoding genes in different species, most prominently in mouse. based on the phylogenetic analyses, clusters of mouse genes appear to have arisen by duplication after separation from the rat lineage . between one and four mouse genes are co-orthologous to each of the five rat genes. rhin <dig> is orthologous to ifi <dig>  and is conserved in location in the locus adjacent to aim <dig> . rhin <dig> and rhin <dig> are orthologous to clusters of mouse hin-a and hin-b containing genes respectively. rhin <dig> is lacking a hin domain coding sequence, but is otherwise orthologous to ifi <dig> and ifi <dig>  the relationship between mouse and rat proteins is summarised in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  apart from gene duplication in the mouse, there has been some domain swapping between paralogues and this provides a patchwork of sequence similarity between different proteins. for example, p <dig> is a hybrid between p <dig> and p205-like sequences  <cit> . the regions of sequence similarity between different mouse proteins are summarised in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 

lineage-specific duplications are also evident within horse, which has  <dig> recognisable genes, four of which form a clade on the pyrin tree . in contrast, the cow genome  shows only a single intact pyhin gene. the specific expansion of the gene family in some species may reflect the evolutionary “arms race” involved in combating infections. gene duplication and diversification may allow better control of lineage-specific pathogens.

evolution of the pyhin family
to describe the evolution of the pyhin family, the hin domain tree was reconciled with a mammalian species tree . duplication and deletion events were inferred based on the presence or absence of hin domains and pseudogenes in different species. the model proposes that an ancestral hin domain was amplified after the divergence of placental mammals and marsupials, and evolved into hin-a, -b, and -c in the ancestor of all placental mammals . we found evidence for sequences for hin-a, hin-b and hin-c domains within the afrotheria  and xenarthra , which are the most basal groups of placental mammals . the losses of the unique aim <dig> hin-c domain described above are indicated in figure  <dig>  some species show numerous pseudogenes containing hin-a and hin-b domains, but these are not considered here. the final number and composition of pyhin proteins differs greatly between species, although dolphin, armadillo, sloth and hyrax genomes have been sequenced only at low coverage, and the genes indicated are likely a minimum estimate of the true number of genes in these species.

branch lengths for both hin and pyrin trees predict that aim <dig> is somewhat closer in sequence to the pyhin gene in the last common ancestor of placental mammals and marsupials, than are the other ifi sequences . this is most pronounced for the pyrin domain sequences . it is reasonable to propose that the ancestral function of the gene was similar to aim <dig>  in nucleating the inflammasome through recruitment of asc. this function for the ancestral pyhin would be expected, since asc binding is a function also conserved in more distant pyrin domain-containing proteins such as nlrp <dig> 

orthology between mouse and human
the identification of mouse and human orthologues is relevant to the use of mouse models for the study of human cellular processes and disease. human and mouse aim <dig> were the only direct orthologues identified between these species based on the phylogenetic analyses of both hin and pyrin domains . the human ifi <dig> and ifix proteins result from gene duplication within the primate lineage. the hin-a domains of these proteins also cluster with higher probability with human and chimpanzee mnda than with the clade of rodent hin-a domains. this is consistent with speciation of rodent and primate lineages prior to amplification of the hin-a domain. the c-terminal hin domain in ifi <dig> is the sole human hin-b domain. rodent hin-b domains are all more similar to one another than they are to the human. thus there are no direct mouse orthologues of human ifi <dig>  ifix or mnda. however, the pyrin domain tree shows that mouse p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> form a clade with human ifi <dig> and ifix, rather than with other mouse proteins. if there is any functional distinction between the ifi pyrin domain clades, then these mouse proteins might have the closest effector function to ifi <dig> and ifix.

whilst it is tempting to infer common ancestry on the basis of shared arrangements of domains , it is most likely that the acquisition of the double hin domain structure in ifi <dig> and p <dig> arose by independent events, as there is no evidence for tandem hin domains in any other non-primate species, including rat, and the phylogenetic analyses of hin domain sequences did not support them as being orthologous. despite the lack of 1: <dig> orthology between mouse and human in the non-aim <dig> proteins, they may all be functionally quite similar. gene duplications within a species could permit the evolution of different expression patterns or different intracellular locations, or may contain amino acid changes that circumvent the efforts of pathogens to evade detection. gene expression patterns were investigated, to see whether the gene amplification had generated differential expression patterns.

expression of mouse genes
mouse aim <dig> expression analysed by northern blot, showed predominant expression of aim <dig> mrna in spleen and large intestine . real-time pcr generated a similar pattern of expression . previous work on human aim <dig> found expression predominantly in spleen, with detectable mrna in small intestine and peripheral blood but levels below detection in most other tissues tested  <cit> . primers were designed for real-time pcr of all mouse family members, and tested for off-target amplification using cloned cdnas from all mouse pyhin genes. we were unable to design primers to specifically amplify ifi <dig>  due to its near identity to ifi <dig> at the 5´ end, and high similarity to ifi <dig> and  <dig> in the rest of the gene. screening of mouse tissues showed a variety of expression patterns. spleen was a major site for most but not all factors. tissues were obtained from c57bl/ <dig> mice, which unlike other strains express negligible amounts of ifi <dig> mrna in spleen  <cit> . however, c57bl/ <dig> skin showed detectable ifi <dig> expression. ifi <dig> and  <dig> showed strongest expression in skin, and interestingly these form a clade on the pyrin tree, together with ifi <dig> , for which we could not analyse expression. this group forms a larger clade with the pyrin domains of human ifix and ifi <dig> . apart from hematopoietic cell expression, ifi <dig> is expressed in epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . it is prominently expressed in the lower proliferating layers of epithelia, including the skin  <cit> . defence of proliferating keratinocytes against infection is a likely role for this group of skin-expressed human and mouse proteins.

ifi <dig> was also well expressed in liver, heart and skeletal muscle, and extensive work implicates p <dig> in muscle differentiation  <cit> . one paper has suggested that ifi <dig> expression at mrna and protein level is limited to the liver  <cit> , although we and others find it more widely expressed, with strongest expression in the spleen  <cit> . overall, our results agree very well with those obtained for expression of ifi203- <dig> and mndal/ifi <dig> in balb/c mouse tissues by zhang et al. <cit> , and provide data for an extra seven genes.

pyhin genes have been predominantly studied in hematopoietic cells, and here we have compared expression of the twelve genes in splenic t and b cells, as well as in bone marrow-derived macrophages  and thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages . aim <dig> was readily detectable in all cells. some genes such as ifi <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed well except in elicited macrophages. ifi <dig>  in contrast, was relatively myeloid restricted amongst the immune cell types, but is not restricted to myeloid cells since it had highest expression in skin . the duplication of pyhin genes allows for evolution of distinct patterns of regulation of similar genes. an example of this is seen with ifi <dig> and ifi <dig>  which result from recent duplication. although on a tissue level they were similarly spleen-specific, on a cellular level ifi <dig> was expressed in t, b and bmm, whereas ifi <dig> was t and b cell-specific.

lastly, we examined expression in bmm from three different mouse strains . ifi <dig> showed marked differential expression, in agreement with previous work  <cit> , and has been investigated as a possible susceptibility factor for lupus in the nzb mouse strain  <cit> . the lack of expression of mndal/ifi <dig> in nzb is due to the lack of this gene in dba and related strains  <cit> . there was no expression of ifi206ifi <dig>  and ifi <dig>  and minimal expression detected for ifi <dig> in both nzb and balb/c bmm. interestingly, these genes are all clustered at one end of the gene array, near aim <dig> . this suggests that this region may be lacking in these strains. strain-specific data are not shown for ifi <dig>  since this gene is barely expressed in bmm .

the inter-strain differences complicate analysis of the aim <dig> gene trap knockout mice  <cit> . the gene trap allele is derived from  <dig> mouse es cells and is generally used on a mixed  <dig> and c57bl/ <dig> background. in the knockout mice, the pyhin locus and chromosome  <dig> regions surrounding the null aim <dig> allele will derive only from  <dig> mice, whereas littermate controls with intact aim <dig> will carry the c57bl/ <dig> gene array. use of aim <dig> knockout mice on a pure background will thus be essential for many studies of aim <dig> function in disease.

in summary, spleen and skin were the two most prominent sites of mouse pyhin expression, consistent with a role in immune defence. gene family expansion in mouse has allowed some diversification of expression patterns. human and mouse pyhin genes are variously expressed in a range of immune cell types and also epithelial and endothelial cells, although the genes do not obviously fill identical “niches”. for example mnda is strongly myeloid restricted  <cit> , but there seems to be no similarly expressed mouse gene. apart from aim <dig>  the lack of concordance of expression patterns and sequence between mouse and human genes emphasises the need to consider the roles of individual proteins separately in the two species.

CONCLUSIONS
defences against invading dna are likely to be found within all species, and are of course well characterised in the bacterial restriction/modification systems. the evolution of the first pyhin protein is likely to have provided a new effector system for combating the threats indicated by stray dna within mammalian cells. aim <dig> appears less changed from the ancestral protein than are the other pyhin proteins, and we anticipate the ancestral protein functioned similarly, in recruitment of the inflammasome in response to cytosolic dna. a role for combating infectious threats is established for aim <dig>  <cit> , with both cytokine production and cell death likely to be important pyhin-mediated defences. duplication of the ancestral gene in the placental mammals may have enabled defence against organisms with a range of different replicative and evasion strategies. since the hin domain is the dna-binding domain, the evolution of hin-a, -b, and -c subtypes in placental mammals may have allowed specialisation to recognise different dna structures. differences in dna-binding preferences of these domains are yet to be established. the pyrin domain evolution is constrained by maintenance of protein-protein interactions, such as recruitment of asc for the aim <dig> pyrin. differences in interaction partners between aim <dig> and the other pyhin proteins warrants investigation, given the distinct natures of their pyrin domains. further gene expansions prominent in mouse and horse may have provided particular advantage in combating species-specific infections. however, it is also possible that a driving force in evolution of the gene family is defence against high activity of endogenous retroelements, which create reverse transcribed dna. although evolution has been fuelled by waves of activity of retroelements  <cit> , levels of activity need to be controlled to prevent excessive genome damage within each generation, and within somatic cells. retroelements are generally silenced by methylation, and there is increasing evidence for their role in cancer and autoimmunity  <cit> . cell death, as is mediated by aim <dig> in response to cytosolic dna, may be an appropriate response to eliminate cells where retroelements are inappropriately active. interestingly, the estimated ages of retroelements in human and mouse genomes show ongoing high activity in the mouse genome but not human genome  <cit> . thus it is conceivable that pyhin expansion in the mouse could be driven by a need to control retroelement activity, as well as infectious disease.
