BACKGROUND
gene expression profiling is expected to rapidly increase the information yield from experiments using nonhuman primates . this is important because nhps are required for the study of aids, stem cell biology, reproduction and neuroscience, but are expensive and in short supply  <cit> .

one question which must be addressed is: given the close evolutionary relationship between rhesus macaque and humans, why not use available human oligonucleotide microarrays with rhesus macaque samples? human oligonucleotide microarrays have been used with chimpanzee samples to obtain useful information  <cit> . cross-species hybridization experiments utilizing rhesus samples with human oligonucleotide microarrays have also been attempted  <cit> . although useful information has been obtained, there are serious limitations to this approach. cross-species comparisons introduce mismatches between a probe and a transcript that are not related to gene expression. thus, it is impossible to know if a weak or absent signal is due to low levels of expression or to a mismatch. approximately 40% of rhesus genes are not detected with a human genechip  <cit> . for genes that are scored present, the abundance of some transcripts may be underestimated due to mismatches between some of the human probes and rhesus targets. longer probes might be expected to be more forgiving of mismatches, but even cdna microarrays have a significant false negative rate when human microarrays are used with rhesus samples  <cit> . thus, the use of human micorarrays with rhesus macaque samples results in a high rate of false negatives and does not allow for the acquisition of quantitative information. clearly, a rhesus macaque specific expression array is needed.

construction of oligonucleotide-based microarrays requires sequence from the 3' end of a transcript. there are two reasons for this. first, most sample labeling protocols are 3' biased  <cit> . as a result, probes chosen from sequence more than  <dig> kb from the 3' end of a gene may not detect a transcript. second, it is important to choose probes from the 3' untranslated region  because such probes are most likely to be able to distinguish between gene family members. this is because coding sequences are much more highly conserved than 3' utr  <cit> .

we report a fast and efficient approach to obtaining high quality sequence of the 3' end nhp orthologs of human genes. the terminal exons of  <dig>  well-annotated human genes were identified. primer <dig>  <cit>  was used to design primers that amplified at least  <dig> bp of 3' sequence. pcr was performed with these primers using rhesus macaque genomic dna as the template. pcr products were cloned and sequenced. over  <dig>  rhesus macaque gene sequences have been deposited in genbank. these sequences were used in the creation of rhesus macaque oligonucleotide microrarrays by two major companies, affymetrix and agilent. in addition, ten of the primer pairs designed in the course of this project were used with dna obtained from three additional nhps: cynomolgus monkey , baboon , and african green monkey .

RESULTS
we found that at least 88% of human last exons were greater than  <dig> bp in length . the mean length for all last exons, including those that may be incomplete on the 3' end was  <dig>  bp . the median length was  <dig>  bp. the shortest last exon in this group was  <dig> bp; the longest was  <dig>  bp. because the 3' end has not been determined for all transcripts, we also examined the lengths of complete last exons . for these genes, the mean and median lengths were  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the shortest and longest last exons in this group were  <dig> bp and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the last exon sequences we determined are available as additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> 

pcr was used to amplify rhesus macaque genomic dna using human primers. the pcr success rate  with the first set of primers designed was 74%. if the first set of primers failed to amplify, a second pair of pcr primers was designed. the pcr success rate with the second set of primers was 59%. thus, with no more than  <dig> sets of human primers, 90% of the rhesus macaque genes could be amplified. only 2% of the pcr products proved difficult to clone. we have deposited sequence information for over  <dig>  rhesus genes in the sequence tagged site database  at ncbi. these sequences were used in the design of rhesus macaque oligonucleotide microarrays by affymetrix and agilent.

we chose ten primer sets that had worked successfully with rhesus macaque dna to determine whether the same primer sets could be used with the genomic dna of other nhps. these ten genes were chosen to represent a range of identities between rhesus and human sequence â€“  <dig>  to  <dig> % identity . the mean similarity between these  <dig> rhesus and human sequences was  <dig> %. all pcrs performed with the  <dig> primers sets worked with both cynomolgus monkey and baboon dna. nine of the ten primer sets worked with vervet dna. new primers were designed for the one gene  that did not work with vervet dna. the redesigned primers were successful with vervet dna. the mean similarity to human sequence was about 94% for rhesus, cynomolgus monkey, baboon and vervet sequences. we also compared cynomolgus monkey, baboon and vervet sequences with rhesus sequences. cynomolgus sequences were highly similar to rhesus sequences: mean  <dig> % identical, range  <dig>  to 100% identical. most baboon sequences were also highly similar to rhesus sequences: mean  <dig> % identical, range  <dig>  to  <dig> % identical. the vervet sequences were the least similar to rhesus sequences: mean  <dig> % identical, range  <dig>  to  <dig> % identical.

discussion
last exons
our use of genomic dna as a template for targeted pcr is critically dependent on last exon length. at least  <dig> bp of sequence is preferred for the design of oligonucleotide probes present in oligonucleotide microarrays available from affymetrix  <cit> . because at least 88% of all human genes have last exons greater than  <dig> bp, for most genes, genomic dna can be used as the pcr template for obtaining 3' sequence.

our calculated mean and median lengths for all human last exons,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively are considerably longer than previous reports of last exon length  <cit> , the longest mean of which was  <dig> bp. the procedures used to determine the lengths of last exons in these studies are not clear though most likely were based on aligning mrna sequence with genomic sequence as done here. one possible reason for the longer last exons observed in the current study is that the sequence data necessary to determine the true 3'-end of many transcripts has become available only recently. our results are based on the use of refseq release  <dig> and genbank build  <dig>  both obtained from ncbi on  <dig> may 2005; other reports are based on earlier versions of the genome when less 3' information was available. although many of the transcripts in this release of refseq are annotated as being complete on the 3' end, we increased the number of complete transcripts by extending them as far as possible in the 3' direction by using additional mrna sequences. an increase in the number of complete transcripts would obviously result in an increase in the mean last exon length. this is supported by the fact that when we considered only genes for which a 3' end was present, the mean and median values increased.

use of sts primers for other nhp species
our results suggest that the primers developed for this project will be useful for obtaining sequence information from the 3' end of genes of other nhp species. further, given that the rhesus and cynomolgus sequences were very similar, we predict that oligonucleotide microarrays designed based on rhesus sequence will work very well with cynomolgus samples. baboon samples should also work well with rhesus oligonucleotide microarrays for most genes. vervet sequences for some genes are more divergent from rhesus than cynomolgus monkey or baboon, as would be expected based on evolutionary relationships. thus, the false negative detection rate observed with vervet samples on a rhesus oligonucleotide microarray may be significant and a targeted approach to obtaining 3' gene sequence from the vervet using primers developed for this project may be justified.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that human genomic dna sequence can be leveraged to obtain sequence from the 3' end of nhp orthologs and that this sequence can then be used to generate nhp oligonucleotide microarrays. affymetrix and agilent used sequences obtained with this approach in the design of their rhesus macaque oligonucleotide microarrays.
