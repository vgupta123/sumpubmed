BACKGROUND
two regions are distinguished in the chromosomal end structure: the telomeric region that caps the chromosome tip and the adjacent subtelomeric region. taken together, the results of recent analyses of subtelomeric dna and the current views suggest that the subtelomeric region is located in the distal chromosomal region between the telomeric and unique chromosome-specific dna sequences  <cit> . on the other hand, it should be taken into account that not all species and not all chromosomes have unique chromosome-specific dna sequences in their distal regions; this is especially true for the polyploid species. there is a vast literature concerning the structure and function of telomeric dna as a specialized end structure in a wide range of eukaryotes. briefly, this dna consists of the n-like sequences and is associated with specific nucleosomal proteins, which provide the telomere protection function and regulation of telomere tract length  <cit> . the first plant telomeric dna was isolated and cloned from arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . the arabidopsis-type telomere tttaggg is conserved and widely occurs among plants; however, it has not been found in alliaceae as well as in many other asparagales  <cit> . the isolation and research of distinct repetitive dna families located at the chromosomal ends have been so far widely used in analysis of subtelomeric plant dna. it has been repeatedly demonstrated that the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes in plant taxa are composed of various tandem repeat families, some of which are species- and/or genome-specific  <cit> . in secale cereale and aegilops speltoides, the species-specific subtelomeric families of tandem repeats constitute about 2% of the nuclear dna  <cit> . the measured lengths of various subtelomeric tandem repeats, their variation patterns, and proximity to telomeric repeats have been analyzed in detail in tomato, barley, rye, and rice. in particular, it has been shown that subtelomeric and telomeric repeats are co-localized on dna fragments longer than  <dig> kb in rice  <cit> . based on the distance between two fish  signals, the distance between subtelomeric and telomeric repeats on some rice chromosomes was estimated as less than  <dig> kb  <cit> . the experiments with stretched rye chromosome fibrils have clearly demonstrated that in certain case, the distance between a long telomeric repeat and the immediately adjacent copies of the subtelomeric repeat psc <dig> was less than  <dig> kb  <cit> . variations in the distance between telomeric repeats and the subtelomeric satellites following them have been also observed in tomato  <cit> . it is of interest that the studies of subtelomeric regions in rye and aegilops have detected diverse combinations of tandemly arranged subtelomeric repeats with interspersed non-repetitive sequences . it has been shown that mutual arrangement of subtelomeric repeats and the presence of interspersed unique or low copy number sequences are chromosome-specific, providing silene latifolia as an example  <cit> . use of a degenerate telomere primer and the vectorette pcr approach has made it possible to isolate and map the dna sequences adjacent to telomeric repeats. cloning of telomere associated sequences in barley has demonstrated that in some cases telomeric repeats are immediately adjacent to subtelomeric tandem repeats  <cit> . large-scale sequencing of the genomes of a number of organisms enabled to completely characterize the structural organization of the subtelomeric regions in almost all human chromosomes  <cit>  and certain rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis chromosomes  <cit> . the salient findings include multiple segmental duplications occurring in more than one subtelomeric region, the presence of mobile elements, chromosome-specific tandem repeats, abundance of internal n-like sequences, the presence of transcribed regions, and the putative genes in subtelomeric regions.

the bac libraries have been recently created and used intensively for studying the genome of triticum aestivum  <cit> . this has offered unprecedented opportunities for examining, in particular, the extensive subtelomeric dna regions of three homoeologous genomes  to get the insights into their reshuffling during formation of the allopolyploid nucleus and evolution. two approaches can be used for selecting the subtelomeric bac clones, namely,  with the help of telomere-specific probes, providing for choosing the clones that contain telomeric repeats and the associated sequences, and  using as probes the dna sequences localized by in situ hybridization to the chromosome ends.

spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> are the satellite dna sequences detected by in situ hybridization on the chromosome ends of several diploid and polyploid triticum and aegilops species. spelt <dig> sequences are the genome-specific subtelomeric tandem repeats of ae. speltoides , the putative progenitor of the b and g genomes in polyploid wheats  <cit> . the number of spelt <dig> localization sites on the chromosome ends of this species is mainly 24- <dig> per genome, although some accessions contain smaller number of these sites. the copy number of spelt <dig> is considerably decreased in the genomes of polyploid species; the maximal number of hybridization sites, amounting to  <dig>  is detected on the chromosome ends of the tetraploid wheat t. timopheevii . in the tetraploid  and hexaploid  wheats of the emmer group, the number of the loci containing these repeats varies from zero to six and spelt <dig> is localized to the ends of predominantly b genome chromosomes  <cit> .

spelt <dig> is localized to the subtelomeric chromosome regions of the three of five diploid species from the section sitopsis  and is undetectable in the genomes of the remaining diploid species, progenitors of the a and d genomes of hexaploid wheat. in ae. speltoides, spelt <dig> is in the subtelomeric regions of the majority of chromosomes; however, the number of chromosomes containing this repeat decreases to three in the tetraploid wheats of the timopheevi group. neither spelt <dig> nor homologous sequences were detectable by in situ hybridization in the emmer wheats, including soft wheat  <cit> .

both subtelomeric sequences, spelt <dig> and spelt <dig>  are always detectable by pcr and southern hybridization in the genome of wheat even when in situ hybridization fails to identify these repeats on the chromosomes  <cit> .

the aim of this research was to analyze the organization of subtelomeric genomic regions containing the spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> sequences in the b genome of hexaploid wheat.

RESULTS
identification of the bac clones with spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> sequences
the location of spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> at chromosomal ends and low copy number in the t. aestivum genome were the advantages enabling spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> to be used as probes for selecting appropriate subtelomeric bac clones. we screened the t. aestivum  bac genomic libraries, representing 8Ã— genome equivalents, with  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> clones. the first step consisted in pcr screening of pools of bac clones. we used the universal spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> primers . the pcr pattern corresponding to a multiband amplification, characteristic of tandemly organized dna sequences, was obtained for five bac clones with spelt <dig> primers. these five bac clones were used for further characterization . we failed to identify spelt1-containing bac using this pcr screening strategy. therefore, we hybridized part of the library  with spelt <dig> probe and identified four bac clones for further analysis .

characterization of candidate subtelomeric clones
the bac clones identified as containing spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> repeats were further characterized as follows:

 determination of insert lengths;

 estimation of the content of repetitive sequence in cloned dna fragments, including various repeats occurring in the subtelomeric regions in wheat--spelt <dig>  <cit> , spelt <dig>  <cit> , psc <dig>   <cit> , pas <dig>  <cit> , and the telomeric repeat tttaggg  <cit> ; and

 hybridization of bac clones to mitotic metaphase chromosomes of the common wheat cvs. chinese spring  and renan.

the results were summarized in table  <dig>  the size of the inserted fragments varied from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. the comparison of the chosen bac clones based on the length of fragments obtained by noti, hindiii, bamhi, and ecori hydrolysis showed that the cloned dna could partly overlap in the following bacs:  2322j <dig> and 2424p <dig>   110o <dig> and 1487n <dig>  high content of repetitive dna sequences was a characteristic feature of all the chosen clones. according to southern hybridization of hindiii, bamhi, ecori fragments of bac clones to common wheat total dna, the highest content of repeats was 80% and the lowest, 25%. the results of in situ hybridization were consistent, confirming a high content of repeats  in bac clones. the hybridization signals covered the entire length of t. aestivum chromosomes for eight of the nine bac clones ; of these eight clones, two bac clones  hybridized to a limited set of chromosomes. predominantly subtelomeric location on the common wheat chromosomes was demonstrated for bac_2050o <dig> only; in this clone, the repeat content was lower then in other clones . the distribution pattern of bac_2050o <dig> on the chromosomes was different. some of the chromosomes, such as 5a, gave a distinct hybridization signal only at the chromosomal end, whereas in other chromosomes, such as 4al, 5bl, and 7bl, hybridization signal displayed multiple locations on their distal third. weak signals in the interstitial regions of chromosomes indicated that part of the sequences present in this bac clone were present not only in telomeres, but also in other chromosome regions. the spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> contents in the selected bac clones were estimated by dot hybridization. the bac clones isolated by pcr using spelt <dig> primers contained 23- <dig> copies of spelt <dig>  no spelt <dig> repeats were found in these clones . the bac clones selected by the hybridization to the spelt <dig> probe contained up to seven copies of this repeat. among them, spelt <dig> was detectable only in single copies in clone 112d <dig>  the spelt <dig> sequences were also identified in clone bac_112d <dig>  which was originally selected using the spelt <dig> probe . to confirm that spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> were organized in tandem arrays in the corresponding bac clones, we assayed the corresponding bac clones using two methods: pcr with the primers specific to these two repeats and rflp analysis of partially digested bac clones . the arrays of tandemly arranged spelt <dig> sequence were found in bac clones 2322j <dig>  2383a <dig>  and 2424p <dig> and arrays of spelt <dig>  in bac clones 110b <dig>  2050o <dig>  478l <dig>  110o <dig>  and 1487n <dig> . the bac clones were also examined for the presence of the tandem repeats psc <dig>  and pas <dig>  used for identification of t. aestivum chromosomes. part of these repeats was located in the subtelomeric regions in the common wheat chromosomes  <cit> . southern hybridization showed that psc <dig>  repeats were absent in these bac clones, whereas pas <dig> repeats were present in bac_478l <dig> only, giving a rather strong hybridization signal . no telomeric repeats n were identified in all bac clones when using telomeric repeat synthetic probe .

in situ hybridization of bac fragments
it is very difficult to accurately localize wheat bac clones on chromosomes using in situ hybridization, because they are very rich in repetitive dna sequences, mainly transposons, present everywhere on the chromosomes  <cit> . thus, we attempted to localize these bac clones through their fragmentation and in situ hybridization of the derived fragments on the chromosomes of common wheat. the procedure consisted in  choosing and hybridization of bac fragments covering more than  <dig> kb and free of repeats or repeat-poor and  hybridization of the fragments containing spelt <dig> sequences. the repeat-poor bac fragments were chosen based on hybridization of bac restriction fragments with total wheat dna and with the spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> probes. the dna fragments of  <dig> kb and longer were used as probes for in situ hybridization. consequently, we succeeded in isolating fragments of about  <dig> kb  and  <dig> kb  from bac clones 2322j <dig> and 478l <dig>  respectively. these two fragments were localized to the subtelomeric chromosome regions; the result of in situ hybridization of 2322j20/ <dig> is shown in figure 1b. a fragment of about  <dig> kb was isolated from bac_2050o <dig>  in situ hybridization of this fragment confirmed its subtelomeric localization; however, this approach failed to identify precise chromosome localizations of bac_2050o <dig>  for the remaining bac clones, the attempts to identify repeat-poor fragments were unsuccessful, presumably, because of the abundance of repetitive sequences . the presence of spelt <dig> tandem repeats with the total length of 8500- <dig>  <dig> bp  in the bac clones of cv. renan made this repeat advantageous as a probe for localizing bacs . with this in mind, we performed in situ hybridization of a pcr fragment of bac_2050o <dig> , obtained using spelt <dig>  spelt52_2050o <dig> hybridized to the ends of three chromosome arms: 1bs, 4bl, and 7bl .

analysis of nucleotide sequence of subtelomeric bac_2050o8
for a more detailed analysis of the structure of subtelomeric dna, the bac_2050o <dig> with a predominant subtelomeric in situ localization was completely sequenced according to chantret et al.  <cit> . the obtained sequence was annotated according to the following strategy. first, the repetitive sequences were identified in the triticeae repetitive sequence database   <cit>  using the blastn and blastx algorithms  <cit>  and in the repbase  <cit>  using the censor program  <cit> . then, we predicted the genes using the genemark.hmm  <cit>  and fgenesh programs  <cit> . the structure of the ~ <dig> kb bac clone is shown in figure  <dig>  the transposable elements identified in 2050o <dig> were listed in table  <dig>  all the repetitive sequences  in this bac clone constituted  <dig> %. interestingly, dna transposons were predominant, representing  <dig> % of the entire bac clone length, whereas retrotransposons constituted only  <dig> %. the main dna transposon subclass in subtelomeric bac_2050o <dig> was cacta, constituting  <dig> % of all transposable elements and  <dig> % of the bac clone length. cacta was represented by caspar and isaac elements with complete ends and partial jorge and fergat elements . caspar_2050o <dig> was  <dig>  <dig> bp in length; in addition, it was the only full-length element, which contained two orfs  corresponding to the transposase and ctg- <dig> genes. the spelt <dig> sequence represented  <dig> % of the total bac clone length . sequence analysis confirmed that aside from spelt <dig>  no other tandem repeats were identified. five hypothetical genes were identified and accounted for  <dig> % of the total bac clone length. analysis of the predicted orfs, which were not the parts of transposable elements, was detailed in table  <dig>  the first two genes were homologous to the hypothetical rice genes and contained conserved xyloglucan endotransglycosylase and riboflavin deaminase-reductase domains; the third was a putative gene for peroxisomal membrane protein pex11- <dig>  the remaining two orfs were hypothetical genes: one contained the armadillo/beta-catenin-like repeats, and the other was unknown, predicted by fgenesh  <cit>  and genemark.hmm  <cit> . the genes were separated by line retrotransposon insertion and unassigned dna sequences. blast alignments of the bac_2050o <dig> sequence and the contigs containing mapped wheat ests  from graingenes database  <cit>  identified two contigs,  <dig> and  <dig>  with a high homology to 2050o <dig> sequence. est contig  <dig> was located on chromosomes 6as and 6bl . the level of homology between est consensus  <dig>  and bac 2050o <dig> sequence  was 86%. the corresponding region of 2050o <dig> was annotated as unassigned dna sequences. the homology of the other est contig  <dig>   to bac_2050o <dig> was higher  in a  <dig> bp stretch, and the region of homology was in the region of the putative peroxisomal membrane protein pex11- <dig> . it was of interest that comparison of the exon-intron structure between pex11-1_2050o <dig> and est contig revealed a complete correspondence of the est to the coding part of the gene. comparison of restriction sites in bac_2050o <dig> with the mapping data for est contig  <dig>  suggested that bac_2050o <dig> was localized to the telomeric part of chromosome 4bl . bac_2050o <dig> could be more precisely localized according to the homology with est sequence be <dig> from contig  <dig>  which was mapped to the telomeric bin 4bl- <dig>  <dig> - <dig>   <cit> .

number
we performed the blast search for the predicted genes in bac_2050o <dig> and their protein products in the rice genome annotation project database  <cit> . we found that the four predicted wheat genes, displaying a significant homology to four putative rice genes, belonged to clone osjnba0056g <dig> pseudomolecule , located at the distal end of rice chromosome 3s  . the rice genes were located close to each other, and their order was the same as that of the corresponding genes in bac_2050o8; however, one of the genes, namely, os03g <dig>  was in the opposite orientation as compared with bac_2050o <dig>  all wheat genes showed a significant homology at the amino acid and nucleotide levels to the putative expressed rice genes. at the amino acid level, gene_2050o8- <dig> matched best to the rice putative protein os03g <dig> , displaying 87% homology over the entire length. both these genes  had six introns of about  <dig> bp. the identity of coding sequences is 81%; 71% of the nucleotide changes were synonymous. the identity of introns is 37-47%.

other genes also demonstrated significant homology to rice : at the amino acid level, gene_2050o8- <dig> was homologous to os03g <dig> , gene_2050o8- <dig> to os03g <dig> , and gene_2050o8- <dig> to os03g <dig>  .

analysis of spelt <dig> nucleotide sequences in bac_2050o8
the spelt <dig> sequences in bac_2050o <dig> were organized as two arrays of repetitive units with a "head-to-tail" orientation. the first array consisted of seven complete units and one truncated fragment at its 3' end. the second array was located  <dig> bp from the first and consisted of  <dig> complete and two outermost truncated units.

to estimate the degree of spelt <dig> sequence conservation in bac_2050o <dig>  we aligned the nucleotide sequences of  <dig> complete units using the multalin program  <cit>  and calculated for each monomer the percentage of identity to the consensus sequence obtained from the multalin alignment . the mean identity to the consensus was 93% . there were no specific differences between the elements from the first and second arrays.

to investigate the evolution of spelt <dig> repeat in triticeae species, all the publicly available spelt <dig> sequences were used. five spelt <dig> sequences  were found, all derived from ae. speltoides genome. it was earlier demonstrated that the spelt <dig> repeat family consisted of two types of monomeric units: spelt <dig>  and spelt <dig> , which shared a conserved  <dig> bp region and had short  variable regions  <cit> . ay <dig> and ay <dig> were the spelt <dig>  and spelt <dig>  monomers, respectively, whereas clones ay <dig>  ay <dig>  and z <dig> consisted of two spelt <dig>  and spelt <dig>  monomeric units.

we performed phylogenetic analysis of all the repeat monomers that contained conserved and variable regions. for spelt <dig> sequences from bac_2050o <dig>  we took the consensus of  <dig> complete monomeric units. we considered the consensus as an adequate representative of the bulk of spelt52_2050o <dig> sequences, because the monomer sequences displayed no specific differences. the phylogenetic tree constructed using mega <dig>  <cit>  contained two major branches formed by spelt <dig>  and spelt <dig>  sequences. the t. aestivum consensus clustered with the spelt <dig>  sequences of ae. speltoides, indicating that bac_2050o <dig> contained only the monomers of spelt <dig>  subfamily .

discussion
spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> as probes for isolating subtelomeric clones
the gaps remaining in the telomeric regions pose hindrances to complete sequencing of eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . new genomic libraries were constructed using various plasmid vectors for closing gaps and capturing the telomeric sequences  <cit> . the diversity of dna that marks the telomeric/subtelomeric regions facilitates the task of sequencing regions at the chromosomal ends. this is quite timely in view of the wheat genome sequencing initiative  <cit> . our relevant finding was that spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> sequences were specific markers of the chromosome ends of ae. speltoides and several polyploid wheat species. hybridization of spelt52_2050o <dig> probe to the wheat cv. renan chromosomes detected three sites with a weak signal per haploid genome at chromosome ends . spelt <dig> was localized on two chromosome ends per haploid genome of cv. renan; one site gave a rather strong hybridization signal . use of spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> for screening the bac library of cv. renan enabled us to choose nine clones presumably associated with the subtelomeric regions . bac_2050o <dig> was localized by in situ hybridization  predominantly to the subtelomeric chromosome regions . comparing the in situ hybridization data for the spelt52_2050o <dig> and the blast search against the wheat mapped est contigs  <cit> , we localized 2050o <dig> to the end of 4bl. a subtelomeric localization of two additional bac clones, 2322j <dig> and 478l <dig>  was demonstrated by in situ hybridization of their subclones 2322j20/ <dig> and 478l20/ <dig>  respectively . since the spelt <dig> probe hybridizes only with the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1bs, 4bl, or 7bl, we can assume that the bac clones containing over  <dig> copies  of the spelt <dig> repeats were from the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 1bs, 4bl, or 7bl . of the spelt1-containing bac clones, 2424p <dig>  partly overlapping with clone 2322j <dig>  can be also ascribed to subtelomeric regions . the in situ hybridization on the chromosomes of cv. renan detected two terminal blocks per haploid genome. however, the screening of bac library with spelt <dig> probe found no clones containing spelt <dig> regions with a length exceeding  <dig> bp  . two reasons can explain the absence of extended spelt <dig> regions in the selected clones, namely:

 the terminal chromosome regions, containing longer spelt <dig> repetitive sequences, escaped cloning when obtaining the genomic bac library of t. aestivum cv. renan, as they could be cut off by the restriction endonucleases ecori, hindiii, and bamhi, used for hydrolysis  <cit> ; and

 a high recombination activity in the region of spelt <dig> repeats could result in discharge of part of these repeats during construction of this library. such effects were observed earlier when we attempted to clone the tandem spelt <dig> repeats with a length of  <dig> bp and more . a high recombination level leading to deletions of spelt <dig> repeats in the progeny of individual self-pollinated plants was also observed  <cit> .

a subtelomeric localization of two clones, 2383a <dig> and 112d <dig>  was questionable because of a low spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> copy number and a failure of in situ hybridization approach in determining their precise localization. thus, the example of spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> repeats demonstrated that satellite dna sequences from the subtelomeric regions of diploid wheat progenitor can be used for selecting the bac clones from the corresponding regions of common wheat chromosomes.

specific features in organization and evolution of spelt <dig> repeats
the spelt <dig> repeats were undetectable in polyploid emmer wheats  by in situ hybridization  <cit> . on the other hand, both blot hybridization and pcr indicated the presence of individual sequences belonging to this family in some studied accessions of the polyploid wheats with the bbaa and bbaadd genomes  <cit> . the failure of in situ hybridization in detecting these sequences can result not only from that detection of the dna sequences shorter than  <dig> bp by this method is hindered, but also with the divergence between the probe used for hybridization and the homologous sequences within the studied species. in particular, it has been shown that two probes with a homology of  <dig> % give quite different hybridization patterns of the tandem repeat family pas <dig>  found in the genomes of ae. tauschii and barley  <cit> .

use of the primers for spelt <dig> repeat allowed us to detect a tandem organization of several bac clones already when screening the bac library. the amplification of spelt <dig> fragments using the same primers and bac_2050o <dig> as a template and produced probe for hybridization allowed us for the first time to localize spelt <dig> repeats in the chromosomes of common wheat by in situ hybridization to the ends of chromosome arms 1bs, 4bl, and 7bl of wheat cv. renan. note that the pcr fragment of spelt <dig> sequence was successfully mapped earlier to the end of the genetic map of 4bl chromosomes  <cit> .

the  <dig> spelt <dig> sequences detected in bac_2050o <dig> displayed a high level of homology . although bac_2050o <dig> contains two regions with spelt <dig> tandems, the clustering of repeated units into two groups according to the primary structure was not observed. it is impossible to compare it with extended spelt <dig> tandem regions of other accessions and species as the corresponding tandem regions are absent in the relevant databases. spelt <dig> family contained two types of repeated units -- spelt <dig>  and spelt <dig> ; note that these monomers in the majority of the studied accessions ae. speltoides alternate  <cit> . the tandems formed by spelt <dig>  sequences have been found only in one ae. speltoides accession, ts <dig>  in the hexaploid wheat genome, in bac_2050o <dig>  we detected only spelt <dig>  tandem sequences . taking into account that ae. speltoides is the most likely donor of the b/g genomes of polyploid wheats, it would be useful to include the presence of different variants of the tandem arrangement of spelt <dig> in the phylogenetic studies of sitopsis and triticum species.

a characteristic feature of the tandem repeats is their ability to amplify during the evolution, thereby increasing their copy numbers and creating a high level of intraspecies polymorphism in the copy number  <cit> . an illustrative example of such variation is the spelt <dig> family with the repetitive unit of  <dig> bp. the number of sites where this repeat is localized varies in a wide range in both ae. speltoides, for which it is genome-specific, and in polyploid species, to whose formation ae. speltoides has contributed  <cit> . both individual plants of the same accession and the progeny of the same plant can differ in the copy number of this repeat  <cit> . the level of spelt <dig> polymorphism is also rather high  <cit> .

the amplification of the same tandem subtelomeric repetitive dna sequences in evolutionary remote cereal species has been described, whereas such amplification is absent in closely related species. for example, the repeat family  <dig> bp/psc200/psc <dig> is characteristic of secale cereale, s. montanum, dasypyrum villosum, d. breviaristatum, and agropyron cristatum; however, it has not been detected by hybridization in other rye species  <cit> . spelt <dig> repeats have been localized to chromosomes of ae. speltoides and other two from four sitopsis species   <cit> . the diversity on the presence of tandem repeats in the subtelomeric chromosome regions of various cereal species suggested the existence of a common pool of sequences able to amplify during evolution, forming a subtelomeric repeat family. cloning and pcr analysis of the amplification product obtained from the rice  genome using the primers specific to spelt <dig> and spelt <dig>  we detected no homology to either spelt <dig> or spelt <dig> repeats except for the primer sequences . we have not also found any degenerate sequences or sequences homologous to spelt <dig> repeat when comparing wheat syntenic bac_2050o <dig> and rice osjnba0056g <dig> pseudomolecule. presumably, the pool of the common sequences involved in amplification events during evolution exists yet is stringently confined to the frame of a taxonomic unit. most likely, such unit for cereals is a tribe.

microcollinearity in the region of bac_2050o <dig> of wheat chromosomes 4bl and rice chromosome 3s
according to the data on distribution of est dna sequences, the wheat group  <dig> chromosomes display the most pronounced similarity to the short arm of rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . individual deviations from collinearity were observed in the centromeric regions and distal part of the consensus chromosome 4bl map. the distal region of wheat chromosome 4bl has been compared in detail with rice pseudochromosome 3s  <cit> . the most pronounced distinctions were recorded in the terminal telomeric bin 4bl- <dig> , which displayed a higher recombination level. bac_2050o <dig>  which contains a sequence with a 90% homology to est be <dig>  is located at a distance of  <dig> mapped ests from the 4bl chromosome end   <cit> . the four putative rice genes, belonging to osjnba0056g <dig> pseudomolecule and displaying a significant homology to four predicted wheat gene in bac_2050o <dig>  are located at a distance of about  <dig> kb from the end of rice chromosome 3s. the terminal regions of wheat  and rice  displayed the following differences:   <dig> of the  <dig> wheat ests located in this region have no homologous sequences in rice, and  the dna sequences covering about  <dig> kbp from the end of chromosome 3s have no homologs on chromosome 4bl . in addition, comparison of the order of wheat ests and rice pseudomolecules suggested that at least two inversion events have occurred in this chromosome region besides duplications . the changes in orientation of the first of the four genes predicted in bac_2050o <dig>  relative to the corresponding rice genes can result from such inversions. note that the rice region  containing these four genes is of  <dig> bp versus  <dig>  <dig> bp of the corresponding wheat region in bac_2050o <dig> . this difference results from an enlarged intergenic region in bac_2050o <dig> . the intergenic regions in bac_2050o <dig> contains two degenerated line elements , one mite element , and an unassigned sequence. at the nucleotide level, the intergenic regions of rice and wheat showed no similarity to each other, and the regions flanking this block of genes in rice showed no similarity to the overall bac_2050o <dig> sequence.

the wheat regions containing the four predicted genes in bac_2050o <dig> is more than threefold longer that the corresponding region from rice osjnba0056g <dig>  whereas the overall wheat genome exceeds the rice genome more than 40-fold and the distal region of chromosome 4bl is 30-fold longer than the corresponding homologous region in rice  <cit> . thus, it is most likely that the wheat genome increased in the regions free of genes. in the case of bac_2050o <dig>  these are the regions of retrotransposons, cacta transposons, spelt <dig> tandem repeats, and unassigned sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of the t. aestivum cv. renan bac clones tagged by subtelomere-specific sequences spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> allowed us to demonstrate the utility of spelt <dig> and spelt <dig> subtelomeric repeats for isolation of the bac clones carrying subtelomeric dna from genomic libraries. analysis of the entire  <dig>  <dig> bp nucleotide sequence of bac_2050o <dig>  the subtelomeric localization of which was demonstrated by fish, provided new data on the primary structure of one of the distal regions in the t. aestivum b genome. in bac_2050o <dig>  class ii transposons are predominant and constitute  <dig> % of the entire clone length, while class i transposons account only for  <dig> %, although the latter transposon class is prevalent in majority of the other published triticeae bac clones  <cit> . among class ii transposons, the most abundant is cacta caspar_2050o <dig> 

the profound analysis of bac_2050o <dig> sequence together with fish of spelt <dig> sequences derived from bac_2050o <dig> allowed us to localize it to the terminal bin 4bl- <dig> . a microcollinearity of the wheat  and rice  gene regions, encoding three hypothetical proteins and putative peroxisomal membrane protein pex11- <dig>  was demonstrated. it was shown for the first time that spelt <dig> sequences have been involved in the evolution of the terminal regions in hexaploid wheat chromosomes.
