BACKGROUND
double-stranded rna interference  is a powerful strategy to transiently inactivate the expression of targeted genes. injection of exogenous dsrna triggers sequence-specific degradation of the target endogenous mrna in the target cells/organisms. dicer rnaseiii-type enzymes cleave cytoplasmic dsrnas into small interfering rnas  duplexes composed of approximately  <dig> nucleotides . sirnas duplexes are incorporated into a multiprotein rna-inducing silencing complex  where the antisense strand guide risc to its homologous target mrna for endonucleolytic cleavage. this mechanism leads to the degradation of the targeted mrna  <cit> . dsrna mediated rnai has emerged as one of the most promising tool to study gene function particularly in organisms for which stable transgenesis is not available. exogenous introduction of dsrna has been developed mainly in invertebrates such as nematodes  <cit>  and insects  <cit> . dsrna can be delivered to insects through artificial feeding  <cit>  or microinjection  <cit> . artificial feeding is a non-disrupting technique preserving the integrity of the treated animals. however, the precise amount of up-taken dsrna cannot be monitored. microinjection is widely used in multiple insect species such as mosquitoes, beetles, honey bees and grasshoppers  <cit> . in these insects, rnai knockdown has been developed for various genes encoding for developmental proteins  <cit> , salivary gland proteins  <cit> , proteins involved in host-insect interaction  <cit> , hormone receptors  <cit> , or gut enzymes  <cit> .

aphids are considered as one of the main animal pests for agriculture. damages caused by aphids are mainly due to their tremendous demographic potential and their adaptation to the modifications of environmental conditions. the international aphid genomic consortium has selected the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum as the model aphid species for developing genomic resources such as ests or genome sequencing  <cit> . in the perspective of the future accessibility of the pea aphid genome sequence, functional analyses tools such as inactivation of gene expression will be essential for further investigations. stable transformation of insects is still limited to few model species . furthermore, this technique would probably be very difficult to develop in aphids because of the low amount of sexual eggs produced and the requirement of diapause after egg production. transitory gene knockdown through dsrnai offers an opportunity to address the role of aphid genes. injection of sirna has already been reported in the pea aphid to knockdown a gene expressed in salivary glands  <cit> . we described here an alternative rnai strategy by injecting long dsrna instead of sirnas and by triggering different tissues. the development of rnai technique in a new species  requires the selection of appropriate marker genes. few criteria define marker genes, which should show a significant rna expression level , not give a lethal phenotype when inactivated  and show different spatial expression profiles to test the sensitivity of various tissues to rnai. based on these criteria, two a. pisum marker genes have been selected with different tissue expression: one ubiquitously expressed encoding a calcium binding protein  and another specifically expressed in the gut encoding a cysteine protease, a cathepsin l  <cit> . for each gene, dsrnas of approximately 300– <dig> nt have been synthesised. their injection in the aphid body led to the inhibition of approximately 40% of targeted genes expression for five days following the injection.

RESULTS
cloning and expression profiles of a. pisum calreticulin and cathepsin l genes
the a. pisum ests database  <cit>  was screened in order to identify full coding sequences  of calreticulin and cathepsin-l. the ctg_ap_ <dig> -apal3sd-i-b <dig> contig was identified as encoding for a  <dig> amino acids  calreticulin  and the ctg_ap_ <dig> -id0aaa18ae10rm <dig> contig for a  <dig> aa cathepsin-l . the sequences resulting from in silico assembly of ests were confirmed by sequencing of the corresponding cdnas .

the number of ap-crt and ap-cath-l gene copies in the pea aphid genome was investigated by assembling matching genomic sequences retrieved from the trace archives of the pea aphid genome. two different calreticulin genes  and one single ap-cath-l gene were found. these in silico results were confirmed by southern-blot analyses . no est was identified for ap-crt- <dig>  suggesting a low expression level for this gene.

no trace was identified for the 3' end of ap-crt- <dig> and the incomplete cds we obtained for this gene covered approximately 86% of the full cds. analysis of the corresponding partial cds in ap-crt- <dig> and ap-crt- <dig> showed that these two genes shared 89% of nucleotide identity suggesting that both genes would be targeted by the same dsrna. the expression of both calreticulin genes has thus to be analysed simultaneously to reflect the global efficiency of rnai knockdown. therefore, all the pcr primers we used for following analysis of calreticulin genes expression were designed in order to cross hybridised between ap-crt- <dig> and ap-crt- <dig>  in the following experiments, both calreticulin genes are named as ap-crt.

the temporal expression of ap-crt and ap-cath-l was investigated by rt-pcr on rna extracted from the four instar stages and two adult morphs . both genes were shown to be transcribed at all developmental stages  indicating that any morph of the life cycle can be targeted to initiate rnai. however, because of size restriction, injection was not possible for the first and second instars .

injection of dsrna
injections of dsrna were performed on the third instar  stage. the developmental stage of injected aphids was synchronised by collecting newly born first instar  over a period of  <dig> h.  <dig> h later, after they all reached the third instar , these larvae were immobilised on ice and dsrnas were delivered into haemolymph by microinjection through a glass needle at slow speed. the injection was realised dorsally in the middle of the abdomens. melanisation of the cuticle of the living aphids was observed at the injection point. a mortality of ranging from  <dig> to 45% was obtained in the two days following injection. similar mortality was observed between individuals injected with a same volume of water, the control bacterial dsrna lacz or dsrnas of interest  indicating that aphid death was not related to gene silencing. injecting less than  <dig> nl per aphids clearly reduced the mortality to approximately 13% indicating that the mortality we observed was partly due to the disruptive effect of injection itself but also by the high injection volume used to deliver dsrna. however, in order to optimise the rnai efficiency, we maximised the amount of delivered dsrna by using  <dig> nl as the injection volume.

silencing of calreticulin
a  <dig> nt dsrna  corresponding to the 5' part of ap-crt- <dig> cds was designed for ap-crt knockdown . analysis of the homologous sequence in ap-crt- <dig> revealed that ap-crt- <dig> and ap-crt- <dig> were 87% identical for this region suggesting that both genes would be knockdowned by ds1ap-crt- <dig>  the efficiency of the inhibition of ap-crt expression in injected aphids was investigated by quantitative rt-pcr  over seven days. for each time point, qrt-pcrs were performed on triplicates . as a negative control, aphids were injected with lacz dsrnas and qrt-pcr data were expressed relatively to the rpl <dig> internal control gene encoding for a ribosomal protein  <cit> . results of the ap-crt expression in dsap-crt- <dig> and control injected aphids are presented in figure  <dig>  despite a high variability between the replicates, an unambiguous decrease of ap-crt transcripts was observed in aphids injected with dsap-crt- <dig>  ap-crt expression was reduced by  <dig> ± 14% one day after injection . the maximum reduction of  <dig> ± 15% of the transcript level occurred at  <dig> dpi and dsrnai had no more effect at  <dig> dpi. no phenotype  was observed in dsa-crt- <dig> injected aphids.

silencing of cathepsin-l
a similar experiment was performed to inhibit ap-cath-l expression by injecting  <dig> nt dsrnas  corresponding to the middle part of the cds  into l <dig> abdomens. as previously observed for calreticulin, approximately half of control and silenced aphids died, and a high variability was observed between replicates. injection of ds1ap-cath-l reduced ap-cath-l expression by  <dig> ± 18% at  <dig> dpi, induced a maximum inhibition of  <dig> ± 19% at  <dig> dpi and was no more effective at  <dig> dpi . no clear phenotype was noticed. these results are similar to the ap-crt- <dig> knockdown. a second ap-cath-l dsrna   including  <dig> nucleotides of the 5'end transcribed untranslated region plus the  <dig> nucleotides of the 5'end of the cds, was injected in order to test the effect of the localisation of the dsrna within the mrna on rnai efficiency . no significant difference of rnai efficiency was obtained between ds1ap-cath-l and ds2ap-cath-l.

discussion
in this study, microinjection of long dsrna was shown to transiently silence the expression of two marker genes in the pea aphid a. pisum. this work confirms the effectiveness of rnai in various tissues of the pea aphid and demonstrates that long dsrna can be substituted to sirna to induce the inhibition of gene expression in aphids  <cit> . since the two marker genes were transcribed all over the aphid life cycle, any development stage could be triggered to perform rnai. third stage instar  was selected to initiate rnai since it was the smallest and youngest stage adapted to injection in our hands. our experiments were characterized by a high mortality within the two days following injection not related to gene silencing. this unspecific mortality was shown to be partly explained by the disruptive effect of the injection but also by the high injection volume used to deliver dsrna  in l <dig>  no comparable mortality was observed following the injection of sirnas but the injected volume was lower  and the target stage was older   <cit> .

rnai efficiency might depend on the targeted gene and its expression profile. we analysed the rnai efficiency of two marker genes with different tissue expression patterns. for ap-crt and ap-cath-l genes, similar inhibition of gene expression from  <dig> to 40% was obtained. by injecting sirnas in aphid females, mutti et al.  <cit>  obtained a decrease of 50% of the expression of a salivary gland gene. this suggests that the two different techniques  induce the same range of decrease of target gene expression. moreover, these results demonstrate that different aphid tissues seem to be equally sensitive to gene knockdown. rnai efficiency appears to be highly variable according to the targeted gene and insect species. the maximum depletion of approximately 40–50% of mrnas obtained in aphid is not a high efficiency for rnai compared to what was previously obtained in spodoptera litura   <cit>  or in drosophila melanogaster   <cit> . however, similar efficiency has been recorded in the hemipterean insect rhodnius prolixus  <cit>  or in grasshopper  <cit> . for most of these cited works , rnai efficiency was tested on individuals rather than on pooled individuals as we did. pooling individuals might have homogenised individual differences and the inhibition of 40% we observed, might reflect a mix of higher and lower rnai efficiency. from our point of view, pooling individuals better reflects the general efficiency of rnai. however, despite pooling of individuals and synchronization of the age of the individuals to be injected, quantification by qrt-pcr of rnai efficiency revealed high variations between the replicates. similar variations due to the detection method and to the variability of rnai efficiency have been previously described for the apple moth epiphyas postvittana  <cit> .

various parameters can be modified to increase rnai efficiency. the most obvious parameter is to increase the amount of dsrna delivered in the aphid. injection of volumes higher than  <dig> nl has been tested but was not effective to increase rnai efficiency since they generated very high mortality rates. in the hemipteran insect rhodnius prolixus, the low rnai efficiency has been increased by multiplying injections. two successive injections of dsrna resulted in an increase of rnai efficiency from  <dig> to 75% of inhibition  <cit> . similar double injections were performed in aphids but resulted in very high mortality preventing the estimation of rnai efficiency . rnai efficiency can depend also on the sequence used as dsrna against the targeted gene. two different dsrna were tested against the gut protease ap-cath-l, each corresponding to either the central or the 3'part of the cds. no difference in gene knockdown efficiency was observed, suggesting that in our experimental conditions, selecting different parts of the cds of the target gene does not improve rnai efficiency.

the duration of rnai inhibition for cathepsin-l and calreticulin was similar, starting the first day following injection, reaching its maximum of 35–40% after five days and disappearing at seven days. during this period, aphids moult two times: starting in the third instar  one day after injection, the knockdown continued at the fourth instar  and ended after the aphids have reached the adult stage seven days later, suggesting that moulting does not disrupt rnai effect. gene knockdown of a salivary gland gene in the pea aphid had a different profile since inhibition was observed only  <dig> days after injection, but was maximal after  <dig> days, as in our conditions  <cit> . a similar duration of rnai has been described for the epospbp <dig> gene in apple moth  <cit>  but duration of gene knockdown by rnai appears to highly depend on insect species: rnai can last up to  <dig> days in the honeybee apis mellifera  <cit>  or more than  <dig> months for the flour beetle tribolium castaneum  <cit> .

no clear phenotype  was observed neither in ap-crt- <dig> nor in ap-cath-l silenced aphids. the absence of a striking phenotype in dsap-crt- <dig> aphid is not surprising since the only phenotype observed after inactivation of the calreticulin gene in drosophila melanogaster was a hypersensitivity to diethylether and resistance to isoflurane, two anaesthetic compounds  <cit> . these conditions were not tested for the dsap-crt <dig> injected aphids. by contrast, the absence of phenotype in ap-cath-l silenced aphids was more unexpected. the a. pisum cathepsin-l is highly identical to the cathepsin-l gene previously characterized in the cotton aphid aphis gossypii and in the peach-potato aphid myzus persicae  <cit> . in m. persicae, the inhibition of cathepsin activities by oryzacystatin  led to a moderate inhibition of aphid growth and fecundity  <cit> . the knockdown of ap-cath-l was expected to generate a similar phenotype. the absence of phenotype in ap-cath-l silenced aphids could be due to the relative efficiency of the silencing . however, oryzacystatin is a general cysteine protease inhibitor and is probably not specific of cathepsin-l  <cit> . the growth defect observed in m. persicae and a. gossypii might be due to the inhibition of other cathepsins.

CONCLUSIONS
this work confirms the effectiveness of rnai in the pea aphid and demonstrates that long dsrna can be used instead of sirna  <cit>  to induce the inhibition of gene expression in aphids. by triggering a different developmental stage  and genes expressed in different tissues, our study is complementary to the work published by mutti et al.  <cit> . by using l <dig>  this work extended aphid rnai to include larval stage and showed that rnai knockdown is active during the moulting process. moreover, we demonstrated that salivary glands were not the only aphid tissue sensitive to rnai since this technique was as effective for a ubiquitously expressed gene like ap-crt <dig> as for a gene specifically expressed in the gut like ap-cath-l. gene knockdown by dsrna or sirna injection will be undoubtedly a valuable tool for the aphid community to investigate aphid gene functions and start reverse genetics.
