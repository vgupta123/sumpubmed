BACKGROUND
as a short-day and temperate plant, soybean  merr.) is sensitive to photo-thermal conditions during flower initiation and development . the responses of soybean cultivars to photo-thermal conditions determine the zone of their adaptation and affect yield, plant height, seed quality, etc.  <cit> .

flowering time is one of the most important traits associated with seed yield and adaptation of soybean. soybean flowering time is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . at least  <dig> major loci control flowering time and maturity in soybean, including e1– e <dig>  and j  <cit> . among them, six genes  have been cloned or identified. e <dig> was reported to be a legume-specific transcription factor which could delay soybean flowering time in long-day conditions  <cit> . e <dig> was identified to be an ortholog of the arabidopsis gigantea gene  <cit> . e <dig> and e <dig> were confirmed to be homologs of phya  <cit> . e <dig> was recently identified as gmft2a, an ortholog of arabidopsis ft  <cit> . j was the dominant functional allele of gmelf <dig>  <cit> . gmft5a was also identified as a key gene to regulate soybean flowering time  <cit> . other orthologs of arabidopsis flowering genes such as gmcols  <cit> , gmsoc <dig>  <cit> , and gmcry  <cit> , and many other genes controlling flowering time have also been identified  <cit> .

environmental factors, especially photoperiod and temperature, play important roles in flowering time. in previous studies, short day and high temperature accelerated the process from emergence to first flowering of soybean, whereas long day and low temperature delayed flowering time  <cit> . the interaction between photoperiod and temperature also influences soybean flowering time  <cit> . however, the genetic mechanism of photo-thermal effects on soybean flowering time is not well documented.

the interaction between gene and environment underlying flowering time has been well elucidated in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , boechera stricta  <cit>  and other species. in soybean, the effects of the genes on flowering time and maturity are influenced by environmental conditions  <cit> . previous analysis of  <dig> near-isogenic lines  with  <dig> e genes  indicated that the effects of dominant alleles on flowering were enhanced in the long day and weakened in the short day  <cit> . the effects of e genes on maturity were also influenced by sowing seasons with different photo-thermal combinations. each dominant gene had a smaller effect on maturity of soybean planted in summer than in spring  <cit> . the effects of the qtls varied with the photoperiodic conditions  <cit>  and latitudinal environments  <cit>  and were population-specific, which enabled the plants to adjust to different climatic conditions  <cit> . however, the responses of flowering time to photoperiod and temperature has not been systematically analysed.

qtxnetwork is a gpu parallel computing software to reveal genetic and environmental interaction underlying the genetic architecture of complex traits  <cit> , the algorithm of the software was based on a mixed linear model. the software was used to study the genetic variations of lint yield and its component traits in cotton  <cit> , and the chromium content and total sugar level in tobacco leaf  <cit> .

the objectives of this study were to determine the variation of qtl effects under different photo-thermal environments and the interaction between the qtl and environments on soybean flowering time using a diverse set of soybean genotypes from different ecological regions.

methods
plant materials
the diversity panel used in this study consisted of  <dig> cultivars originating from different ecological regions in china  and different maturity groups in the us . the chinese cultivars included six sowing season ecotypes, i.e., northern spring sowing type  , huang-huai-hai spring sowing type  , huang-huai-hai summer sowing type  , southern spring sowing type  , southern summer sowing type   and southern autumn sowing type   covering a range of latitudes from 20°03’n to 50°15’n. the us cultivars were from different maturity groups  .

experimental design and phenotypic data collection
the pot experiments were conducted outdoor at the institute of crop science, caas, beijing, china  during  <dig> and  <dig>  in  <dig>  only  <dig> cultivars from different ecological regions were used . the pots were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications in six photo-thermal environments. these cultivars were planted on may  <dig>  and june  <dig>  in  <dig>  and on april  <dig>  and june  <dig>  in  <dig>  so the plants could be exposed to low temperature  by growing in the spring and high temperature  in the summer  <cit> . each replicate consisted of five seedlings with uniform growth in each pot. after the cotyledons were fully expanded , the plants were placed in four different photoperiod treatments: short day  , long day  , natural day-length of spring sowing in beijing  and natural day-length of summer sowing in beijing . under the sd treatment, seedlings were placed in the natural sunshine for 12 h, followed by 12 h in the darkness from 7 pm to 7 am. a platform truck was used to transfer the plants to the dark room. under the ld treatment, plants were provided artificial light from 4 am to 6 am and from 6 pm to 8 pm. incandescent bulbs with photosynthetically active radiation  at approximately  <dig> μmols−1m− <dig> placed above the canopy when the bulbs were the only source of light  <cit> . the mean natural day-length of planting season  in beijing was  <dig>  h, and the longest  and shortest  day-length were  <dig>  h and  <dig>  h, respectively.

the field experiments were also conducted at the institute of crop science, caas, beijing, china in  <dig> and  <dig>  these cultivars were planted on april  <dig>   and june  <dig>   in  <dig>  and on may  <dig>   and july  <dig>   in  <dig>  all lines were arranged in a completely randomized design with three replications.

during the experiment, the phonological stages of emergence  and the beginning bloom  were recorded as described by fehr and carviness   <cit>  as well as wu et al.   <cit> .

dna extraction and genotyping
genomic dna was isolated from fresh leaves of five plants of each cultivar using the sds  method  <cit> . one hundred and seventy-two ssr makers associated with qtls controlling phenological traits and other agronomic traits were selected according to previous studies ). ssr primers were from soybase . the pcr reaction mixture contained 100 ng of genomic dna, 2 μl of 10 × pcr buffer , 2 μl of dntps ,  <dig>  μl of ssr primer ,  <dig>  μl of taq polymerase  and  <dig>  μl of ddh2o in a total volume of 20 μl. the amplification program consisted of 94 °c for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94 °c for 30 s, 49 °c for 30 s, 72 °c for 45 s and 72 °c for 5 min. then, the pcr products were separated on 6% w/v denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the fragments were visualized by silver staining. the cultivars were also genotyped with illumina barcsoysnp6k iselectbeadchip  containing  <dig>  snps selected from soysnp50k  <cit> . after elimination of snps with missing allele >24%, or minor allele frequency < <dig>   <cit> , a total of  <dig>  snps remained . ssr and snp data were used for association mapping, and the snp data was used for qtxnetwork analysis.

genetic diversity and population structure analysis
the population structure was inferred from  <dig> ssr markers, which were randomly chosen and evenly distributed on  <dig> chromosomes , using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo model via structure v. <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . the k value  was set from  <dig> to  <dig> using a burn-in of  <dig> , a run length of  <dig> , and each k value was obtained with seven independent runs. the ad hoc quantity  was estimated through the website  to determine the true k value  <cit> . the q matrix was obtained by the clumpp software and by integrating the cluster membership coefficient matrices of replicated runs from structure. a similar procedure described above was used for population structure analysis based on  <dig>  snp makers. a principal component analysis  for population structure was conducted by genalex  <dig>  and the neighbour-joining tree was constructed by powermarker v.  <dig>  and mega  <dig>  the genetic diversity of the panel was also analysed by powermarker v.  <dig> .

the linkage disequilibrium and association analysis
the tassle v.  <dig>  software was used to calculate the linkage disequilibrium  for all pairwise loci of the snp markers  <cit> . the general linear model  and the q matrix from structure software were used to identify the association of  <dig> ssr and  <dig>  snp markers with flower time  <cit> . the bonferroni-corrected thresholds for the p-value were used to determine the significance of association and were  <dig>  × 10− <dig> , and  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  for ssr and snp markers, respectively. functional annotations of snps and ssrs were performed using the phytozome database  and soybase database .

association mapping based on the qtxnetwork
the qtxnetwork software was used to dissect the genetic architecture of the flowering time with  <dig>  snps. association mapping was performed using the mixed linear model with environment  as a fixed effect, and the loci effects  and loci by environment interaction  as random effects  <cit> . the loci with –log10 >  <dig>  in different environments were identified.

RESULTS
the effects of photoperiod and temperature on flowering time in soybean
a wide range of phenotypic variation was observed in flowering time in the association panel across different photo-thermal conditions . all cultivars can flower under the sd or natural-day condition regardless of the sowing season. however, some cultivars in the ld condition failed to flower at the harvest season. the soybean flowering time followed a normal distribution except for flowering time in natural day-length conditions, which was slightly skewed to the early flowering . the duration from emergence  to the beginning bloom  was shorter in the sd than that in the ld condition given the same sowing season. however, the time from emergence  to the beginning bloom  was accelerated in the ht compared with that in the lt under the same day-length.table  <dig> descriptive statistics of soybean flowering time in different photo-thermal treatments

csome late cultivars failed to flower before the end of experiment. the flowering time of the latest-flowered cultivar in the same treatment was used as that of the un-flowered cultivars when calculating the means




collectively, high temperature and short day had additive effects on accelerating the flowering time. the mean pre-flowering phase was the shortest in the sd + ht condition  and the longest in the ld + lt condition . these results suggest that flowering time can be greatly affected by photo-thermal conditions as described in the previous studies  <cit> .

population structure, genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium
the population structure was assessed by structure v. <dig> . <dig> software based on ssr and snp markers and the most likely number of sub-populations were consistent based on the two types of markers. when k =  <dig>  the ad hoc quantity  estimation had the highest value   <cit> . the first sub-population contained  <dig> cultivars, a majority of which were from the late maturity groups in the huang-huai-hai river valley, and south china . the cultivar ‘altana’ from the us was also in this group. the second sub-population consisted of  <dig> cultivars of the early maturity groups , which were from northeast china  and the us . a cluster analysis and pca also showed that the genotypes were classified into two groups .fig.  <dig> population structure of  <dig> soybean cultivars using  <dig> snp markers. a estimation of the number of sub-populations. the left figure was a plot of ln  vs. k ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and the right figure was a plot of subpopulation number vs. delta k values. b population structure of  <dig> soybean cultivars based on snp markers. the x-axis indicates the cultivars, and the y-axis indicates the q value from structure  <dig> . <dig>  the red color represents one sub-group, the green color represents another. c pca of  <dig> soybean cultivars with the top two principal components. d neighbor-joining tree of the  <dig> soybean cultivars




the averaged numbers of alleles per locus for snps and ssrs were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and the pic values for snps and ssrs were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the genetic diversity of snp  is less than that of ssr , which is likely due to the difference of the bi-allele nature of snp and the multi-allele nature of ssr. however, because the total number of snps is  <dig>  times as high as that of ssr, indicating that ssr can provide more genetic information than snp for assessment of genetic relatedness. the fst between the two sub-populations defined by the structure were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for ssrs and snps, respectively, which were similar to that between soybean breeding lines and landraces  in a previous study  <cit> . low population differentiation indicated a narrow genetic background in modern soybean cultivars.table  <dig> the genetic diversity of soybean population based on ssr and snp markers

a total of  <dig> snps with p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and  <dig> ssrs with p <  <dig>  × 10− <dig> were associated with the phenotypic values when glm was performed . the markers were further clumped based on the linkage disequilibrium blocks defined using the method described previously  <cit>  and resulted in  <dig> qtls for flowering time . the proportion of genotypic variance explained by qtls ranged from  <dig> to 35% among different environments . the number of detected loci in each environment was different. there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> loci significantly associated with flowering in the ld + lt, ld + ht sp, su, 14sp, 14su, 15sp and 15su, respectively. in addition, a total of  <dig> loci were detected in both pot experiments and field experiments, suggesting the soybean flowering were controlled by both environment-sensitive loci and environment-insensitive loci.table  <dig> the loci associated with flowering time and their phenotypic variation explained by the glm model

a total of  <dig> markers were significantly associated with flowering time and were specific to photo-thermal  . a total of  <dig> markers were associated with flowering time in two and more environments, among these, four markers  were identified in eight environments. the results indicated that these loci were important in controlling soybean flowering under multi-environments.

the most significant loci associated with flowering time varied under different photo-thermal conditions . among ssr markers, satt <dig> on chr <dig> was the most significant locus associated with flowering time in the two ld conditions; sat_ <dig> on chr <dig> was the most significant locus in the sp and su conditions. whereas, sat_ <dig> on chr <dig> was the most significant locus in the 14sp, 14su and 15su conditions, respectively. satt <dig> on chr <dig> was the most significant locus with flowering time in the 15sp and 15su conditions, respectively. among snps, gm11_ <dig> was the locus most significantly associated with flowering time in the four conditions . gm16_ <dig> was the locus most significantly associated with flowering time in ld + lt and 15su conditions, respectively. gm20_ <dig> on chr <dig>  gm20_ <dig> on chr <dig> and gm11_ <dig> on chr <dig> were the locus most significantly associated with flowering time in the ld + ht, sp and su conditions, respectively. the significant snps were also detected in more than six environments, indicating that these loci may involve in regulation of flowering time in different photo-thermal conditions.fig.  <dig> manhattan plot and linkage disequilibrium block in different environments. linkage disequilibrium blocks associated with flowering time near gm11_ <dig>  gm11_ <dig>  gm16_ <dig>  gm20_ <dig> and gm20_ <dig>  significance threshold is denoted by the orange line. the up panel was the manhattan plots of negative log10-transformed p values vs. snps. the down panel was haplotype block based on pairwise linkage disequilibriumr2values. ld, 16 h; lt, low temperature ; ht, high temperature ; sp, spring sowing season with natural day-length in  <dig> pot experiment; su, summer sowing season with natural day-length in  <dig> pot experiment; 14sp, spring sowing in  <dig> field experiment; 14su, summer sowing season in  <dig> field experiment; 15sp, spring sowing season in  <dig> field experiment; 15su, summer sowing season in  <dig> field experiment




the alleles of the significant snps  had different effects on flowering time across different photo-thermal conditions .  <dig> and  <dig> cultivars contained t allele and c allele for the snp gm11_ <dig>  respectively. the flowering time of the cultivars with minor allele c were delayed for  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d compared with that of the cultivars with t allele  under the ld + lt, ld + ht, sp, su, 14sp, 14su, 15sp and 15su, respectively. similarly, the cultivars carrying the minor allele g of the snp gm20_ <dig> were  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig> d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d,  <dig>  d and  <dig>  d later in flowering time than the those carrying the major allele a in the ld + lt, ld + ht, sp, su, 14sp, 14su, 15sp and 15su conditions, respectively. the same patterns of the association of the two alleles with flowering time were also observed at other three significant loci gm11_ <dig>  gm16_ <dig> and gm20_ <dig>  generally, ld could extend the difference of the flowering time between the cultivars carrying different alleles, while high temperature  could reduce the difference of the flowering time between the cultivars .fig.  <dig> phenotypic variation between cultivars carrying different alleles of the snps significantly associated with flowering time in various environments. the box plot shows the significant difference of days to flowering of the cultivars carrying two alleles of the snps. the significant snps were gm11_ <dig>  gm11_ <dig>  gm16_ <dig>  gm20_ <dig> and gm20_ <dig>  the major allele of significant loci was marked by yellow, and the minor allele was marked by green. significant differences tested by the student’s t-test are also given . ld, 16 h; lt, low temperature ; ht, high temperature ; sp, spring sowing season with natural day-length in  <dig> pot experiment; su, summer sowing season with natural day-length in  <dig> pot experiment; 14sp, spring sowing in  <dig> field experiment; 14su, summer sowing season in  <dig> field experiment; 15sp, spring sowing season in  <dig> field experiment; 15su, summer sowing season in  <dig> field experiment




genotype and environment interaction on soybean flowering time
to explore the genotype and environment interaction on soybean flowering time, we used the phenotype in  <dig>  the heritability of flowering time was  <dig> %, and the heritability of additive and epistasis effects were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the heritability of genotype × environment interaction was  <dig> %, which was constituted by epistasis × environment interaction  and additive × environment interaction . these results indicated that soybean flowering time was mainly controlled by additive × environment interaction and the epistasis × environment interaction .table  <dig> estimated heritability of the flowering time in soybean

there were  <dig> loci with significant additive effects and/or additive × environment interaction effects, and  <dig> pairs of loci with significant epistatic effect and/or epistasis × environment interaction effects on soybean flowering time in six environments . gm04_ <dig>  gm04_ <dig> and gm15_ <dig> had significant additive effect, indicating that the additive loci were stable in different environments, whereas gm11_ <dig>  gm16_ <dig>  gm19_ <dig> and gm19_ <dig> had both significant additive effects and additive × environment interactions, suggesting that these loci were sensitive to different environments. among them, gm11_ <dig> was the most significant and had high heritability of additive effect  and additive × environment interaction . in addition, gm04_ <dig> interacted with two other loci  to control phenotypic variation of flowering time, and gm04_ <dig> and gm19_ <dig> had epistasis × environment interaction in the sp condition.table  <dig> the predicted genetic effects with significant heritability of the flowering time for soybeans in six environments

we also found that the direction of additive × environment interaction effect on soybean flowering time is dependent on photoperiod, whereas the magnitude of additive × environment interaction effect is dependent on temperature . for instance, the additive by environment interaction of gm19_ <dig> had a negative effect in the sd condition but positive in the ld condition, showing that the locus could enhance flowering time in the sd condition but delay flowering time in the ld condition. in contrast, the additive by environment interaction of gm16_ <dig> and gm11_ <dig> were positive in the sd condition but negative in the ld condition, suggesting that these loci could delay flowering time in the sd condition and accelerate flowering time in the ld condition. in response to photoperiod, the locus gm19_ <dig> showed opposite effect on flowering time compared with gm16_ <dig> and gm11_ <dig>  on the other hand, for gm16_ <dig> and gm11_ <dig>  the magnitude of delaying effect on flowering time was larger in the ht condition than in the lt condition, and the effect of gm19_ <dig> on the delay of flowering was also larger in the ht condition than that of the lt condition. these results indicate that high temperature could enhance both the positive or negative effects on flowering time in the sd conditions.

discussion
the effects of genetic loci on soybean flowering time are dependent on photo-thermal conditions
in the present study, a large variation of days to flowering was observed among different environments and  <dig> % of total phenotypic variation was contributed by environmental and genetic interaction, indicating that photo-thermal conditions played an essential role in determining soybean flowering time in addition to the genetic effects. the photo-thermal treatments in the current study provided a good opportunity for dissecting for dissecting the effects of photoperiod and temperature on soybean flowering time.

the environmental effect on the genetic variation of soybean flowering time had not been well documented  <cit> . in our previous study,  <dig> of  <dig> cultivars originated from different latitudes in china were selected to analyse the effects of photoperiod and temperature and the interaction between photoperiod and temperature on flowering time  <cit> . the results enhanced the understanding of the photo-thermal effects on flowering time at the phenotypic level. however, the effects of loci related to flowering time across photo-thermal conditions were not reported.

in this study, the effects of flowering-time-related loci in different photo-thermal conditions have been evaluated. some loci were detected in only one environment, others were in multiple environments. the number of loci and their associated effects varied across different photo-thermal conditions. interestingly, none of the loci was associated with the flowering time in the sd treatment. in the previous arabidopsis studies, there were few qtls linked to flowering time of the plant grown in sweden than italian conditions. it was speculated that the sweden condition may represent saturated vernalization conditions, which could reduce the variation in flowering time among genotypes and result in reducing or removing the expression of some genes  <cit> . similarly, soybean is a typical short day crop, we speculate that short day may also normalize soybean flowering time and remove contribution of some genes. the phenotypic variance of cultivars from different maturity groups became small in sd condition. short days could reduce the effect of the dominant alleles of each dominant e genes on delaying flowering and maturity time in soybean  <cit> .

interaction between loci and environment for soybean flowering time
further analysis of the qtl detected by qtxnetwork confirmed the genetic variation underlying soybean flowering time across different environments. the expression of flowering time genes was influenced by environmental conditions, which is consistent with the results on arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . jia et al.  identified gene × environment interaction of cotton yield traits via the software qtxnetwork and classified genetic loci into three types: constituted loci , environment-specific loci , and environment-sensitive loci   <cit> . our study identified the same types of loci with both additive and epistatic effects, and their interactions with the environment that controlled soybean flowering time. our result is inconsistent with previous finding that soybean flowering time is mainly controlled by the additive effect  <cit> . this inconsistency may result from different genetic backgrounds of materials used in different studies. previous evidence showed that epistasis played an important role in controlling flowering time, and epistasis explained a portion of the ‘missing heritability’ in plants  <cit> . in arabidopsis, phytochrome a  interacts with co protein in the photoperiod pathway, and co interacts with gibberellins to regulate the expression of ft in the ga pathway  <cit> . gm04_ <dig>  identified in the present study may be a core locus of epistasis interacting with other loci for controlling soybean flowering time. in our previous studies on soybean photo-thermal responses, we proposed that photoperiod determines whether soybean plant is reproductive or vegetative, whereas temperature controls its developmental rate, and the magnitude of temperature effects depends upon the developmental status of the plants   <cit> . through the analysis of the interaction between genotypes and environments in the current study, we found that whether the additive × environment interaction effect on soybean flowering time was positive or negative was dependent on photoperiod, whereas the magnitude of additive × environment interaction effect was on temperature, which is consistent with the model of photo-thermal interactions on flowering time in soybean  <cit> .

the flowering time loci and candidate genes
in this study, ssr markers were mainly selected based on the previous linkage analysis related to important agronomic traits, particularly phenological traits. nine of the  <dig> significant ssr markers found in this study were previously reported to be linked to flowering time and maturity. several snps identified in the present study were located in or adjacent to the previously reported qtls . two clusters of significant markers in gm <dig>  and gm <dig>  were significantly associated with flowering time. gm <dig>  contained two flowering time related qtls  <cit>  and two maturity qtls  <cit> , this region was also reported to be linked to flowering time in an association population  <cit> . the cluster of significant markers on gm <dig>  was consistently identified to be closely linked to soybean flowering time through linkage mapping and related to maturity and plant height through association mapping  <cit>  . the cluster of significant markers on gm <dig>  identified the same genomic region of flower number qtls. the markers in those regions could potentially be used by soybean breeders to improve soybean adaptability. additionally,  <dig> novel loci associated with soybean flowering time were identified.

identification of genes involved in soybean flowering time may give us a better understanding of the genetic mechanism underlying the environmental regulation on soybean flowering time . the loci gm04_ <dig>  gm16_ <dig> and gm19_ <dig> were identified to be associated with flowering time using both tassel and qtxnetwork software. of the four important flowering genes glyma04g <dig> , glyma16g <dig> , glyma16g <dig>  and glyma19g <dig>  which were within 300 kb of the significant snps, glyma04g <dig>  is located at  <dig>  kb downstream of the peak snp gm04_ <dig>  constans  is the key transcriptional activator of the gene that encodes the “florigen” protein flowering locus t  in arabidopsis  <cit> . glyma16g <dig> and glyma16g <dig> were close to the significant snp gm16_ <dig>  with physical distances of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. glyma16g <dig> and glyma16g <dig> are the key flowering time genes gmft2a and gmft2b, and gmft2a is identified as the key flowering integrator in soybean  <cit> . gm19_ <dig> is located between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of glyma19g <dig> , which encodes the phytochrome a  protein  <cit> , a far-red receptor involved in stabilizing the flowering activator constans  protein during the late afternoon  <cit> . the peak snp, gm20_ <dig>  detected in the sp condition was located  <dig>  kb upstream of the gene glyma20g <dig>  a homolog of pft <dig>  in arabidopsis, which was an activator of flowering in a photoperiod pathway  <cit> . in the ld + ht condition, the peak snp, gm20_ <dig>  is  <dig>  kb upstream of the gene glyma20g <dig>  a homologous gene encoding cop1-interacting protein, which is a regulator of light-regulated genes and a potential direct downstream target of cop <dig> for mediating light control of gene expression  <cit> . gm11_ <dig> was the peak snp in su conditions, and  <dig>  kb upstream of the flower gene glyma11g <dig>  which was predicted to encode auxin response factor  <dig>  the peak snp, gm11_ <dig>  detected in the su, 14sp, 14su and 15sp four conditions was located  <dig>  kb upstream of the gene glyma11g <dig>  a homolog of constans protein, which has not been reported in soybean. these results indicate that our methods of association mapping and genetic effect analysis across different photo-thermal conditions were efficient in detecting the major and significant genomic regions  and genes regulating soybean flowering time. the markers associated with these loci can be utilized as markers for marker-assisted breeding for improving soybean adaptation.fig.  <dig> the positions of flowering time-related loci and their corresponding candidate genes. the positions of candidate genes were marked in black, the loci were shown in red,  and the known flowering genes were underlined. the position of the first locus on each chromosome was set as zero, and the left number showed the relative in the genome, 1 = 100 kb




the implication of loci associated with flowering time for soybean adaptation improvement
the photo-thermal treatments in the current study were designed to simulate the natural conditions in three main soybean production regions in china, so the results could facilitate soybean breeding in those regions. the treatment of long day-length and spring-sowing in the current study is similar to the growth conditions in the northeast spring-sowing region, whereas the short day-length with spring-sowing and summer-sowing treatments resemble with the growth conditions in the south spring-sowing and south summer-sowing regions. the natural day-length with different sowing seasons in beijing simulates the growth conditions of spring and summer-sowing soybeans in the huang-huai-hai river valley. the peak locus on gm <dig>  under the ld + lt treatment is a useful marker for marker-assisted selection of adaptation in the northeast china, whereas the loci sat_ <dig>  gm11_ <dig>  gm11_ <dig>  and gm20_ <dig>  could be utilized for selection in the huang-huai-hai river valley. the markers, gm16_ <dig> and gm11_ <dig>  detected in both the ld and sd conditions could be utilized for selection in both northeast and south china.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a total of  <dig> markers  associated with flowering time of soybean were identified via gwas. the number and effect of loci associated with flowering time of soybean depended on the photo-thermal conditions. the loci with large effects were found to be located on gm  <dig>  gm  <dig> and gm  <dig>  consistent with previous reports. the variation of soybean flowering time among the cultivars mainly resulted from gene × environment interactions, particularly epistasis × environment interaction and additive × environment interaction. gm04_ <dig> , gm16_ <dig> , and gm19_ <dig>  are important for controlling flowering time. among them, gm04_ <dig> may be the major locus with epistatic interaction with other loci for controlling flowering time. the direction and magnitude of the interaction between loci and environments were dependent on photo-thermal conditions, indicating that photoperiod determines the developmental status of plant , but temperature controls the developmental rate of plant. in summary, the results provide insights into the genetic basis of soybean flowering time and markers could be used for marker-assisted breeding to improve soybean adaptation.
