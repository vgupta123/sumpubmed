BACKGROUND
molecular lock-and-key systems are common among reproductive proteins and receptor-hormone complexes  <cit> . because the lock and the key must match in such systems, any evolutionary novelty at one component must be accompanied by a matching novelty at the other. this coevolution constraint has made the generation of new combinations a major -and as yet unsolved- puzzle in evolutionary biology  <cit> . understanding molecular details of the interaction can give important insight into the evolutionary dynamics of these systems  <cit> . in particular, the proportion of sites involved in recognition and potentially able to alter the interaction is crucial.

self-incompatibility  systems are fascinating molecular lock-and-key mechanisms preventing selfing in species from over half of all angiosperm families  <cit> . in the brassicaceae, the lock and the key are encoded by srk and scr respectively, two highly polymorphic and closely linked genes. scr encodes a small protein expressed in anthers and deposited in the pollen exine layer, while srk encodes a transmembrane serine/threonine kinase with allele-specific affinity for scr proteins.

srk is an integral component of the plasma membrane of the stigma epidermis and is displayed with its glycosylated n-terminal s-domain external to the cell. when activated by binding to its cognate scr protein  <cit> , it prevents selfing by triggering a downstream regulatory pathway that ultimately inhibits pollen tube germination.

although the recognition between scr and srk has been demonstrated at the molecular level, the regions of these molecules important for specificity recognition have remained elusive. in scr, a domain swapping experiment in brassica between allele scr <dig> and allele scr <dig> resulted in a switch from scr <dig> to scr <dig> specificity, but failed to switch specificity when the reverse swapping  was performed  <cit> . these results suggest the intriguing possibility that functionally important sites may not be the same in the two alleles investigated.

clearly, the analysis of more alleles will now be required to confirm the role of these domains . a second experimental approach in scr relied on the functional comparison between pairs of closely related alleles in brassica rapa and b. oleracea.  <cit>  demonstrated that pollen specificity was partly and completely altered between scr copies differing by four and eight amino-acid differences respectively, thus providing strong candidates for functionally important codons. in srk, technical challenges associated with crystallizing trans-membrane proteins have hampered the resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the protein, such that sites involved in binding scr  are currently unknown. hence, specificity-determining nucleotides along the srk sequence have mainly been inferred from the observation that stretches of nucleotides have unusually elevated replacement site polymorphism as compared to the rest of the s-domain. such hyper-variable  regions have been observed in brassica  <cit> , raphanus sativus  <cit>  and arabidopsis lyrata  <cit> .  <cit>  and  <cit>  demonstrated that these regions are particularly conserved among functionally equivalent allelic copies of bosrk <dig> and bosrk <dig> in b. oleracea, and  <cit>  further showed that pairs of closely related alleles in b. rapa and b. oleraceae with identical recognition specificity typically exhibit very few differences in hv regions. more recently,  <cit>  provided further support for a functional role of these regions by reporting that alleles in a. halleri, a. lyrata and a. thaliana that were probably inherited from a common ancestor have fewer amino acid differences in these regions than in the rest of the gene.

a limit to this "direct comparison" approach to pinpoint functionally important sites is that it typically relies on a low number of naturally occurring variants and does not integrate over evolutionary times. an alternative approach is based on the assumption that sites involved in the interaction evolve under specific selective pressures. in particular, while purifying selection at a codon site is expected to decrease the rate of non-synonymous to synonymous evolution , positive and balancing selections are expected to increase this ratio. tracking the signature of natural selection at the codon level can thus reveal functionally important sites along a sequence . as initially demonstrated by wright  <cit> , loci governing si are expected to experience negative frequency-dependent selection, a form of strong balancing selection whereby low frequency scr-srk combinations enjoy a selective advantage over alleles present at higher frequency because they encounter their cognate allele only rarely. consequently, substitutions affecting allelic specificity are expected to enter a population more often than substitutions not affecting specificity, leading to a higher rate of non-synonymous than synonymous substitution at codons functionally determining specificity. in line with this expectation,  <cit>  found higher dn/ds in brassica hv regions than in the rest of the protein , thus providing further support for their role in specificity.

similarly,  <cit>  showed that hv regions in brassica are enriched in sites with elevated dn/ds ratios as compared to the rest of the protein.

a recent paper estimated in brassica that  <dig> of the c.a.  <dig> codon sites  of the s-domain of srk  are likely to evolve under recurrent positive selection events  <cit> . however, the very long expected time to coalescence of alleles at srk translates into very high levels of diversity, which can saturate the signal of divergence. this may bring uncertainty into the phylogeny of srk alleles, causing potential bias and lowering the power of the detection method. as shown by  <cit> , the power of the analysis indeed decreases with sequence divergence. the possibility thus exists that these codons represent a very small proportion of sites involved in specificity. moreover, srk diversity in brassica is unusual among the brassicaceae in that alleles at this locus cluster into two very distinct and highly divergent allelic classes. brassica thus only shows a subset of the total molecular diversity found at this gene in the related a. lyrata  <cit> , and we recently reported at least two deeply divergent srk alleles in the closely related a. halleri  <cit> . there has currently been no evaluation of how the particular allelic topology in brassica may affect the power and accuracy of the method. as reported in  <cit> , increasing the number of lineages  is one of the most efficient ways to increase the statistical power of the method.

in the present paper, we aim at estimating the number of codons determining allelic specificity at the pistil gene involved in self-incompatibility in the brassicaceae, and at testing whether these codons cluster specifically within the well-known hypervariable regions of the s-domain, through an analysis of a large data set of sequences belonging to three taxa. we report nucleotide sequences for  <dig> new srk alleles in a. halleri, including about half of the s-domain for all alleles and the kinase domain for six alleles. we provide evidence for some of these sequences that they do indeed belong to srk and compare sequence polymorphism between a. halleri, a. lyrata and brassica. we use a maximum likelihood method to identify codons along the gene that evolved under positive selection and compare the number, location and rate of evolution of such sites in the three taxa. through simulations we demonstrate that the analysis is highly accurate, and estimate that the power approaches 60%. since  <dig> codons exhibit signs of positive selection in at least one species, we estimate that almost a quarter of the sites in the sequence  could be involved in recognition. our analysis also provides additional support for a functional role of hypervariable regions along the gene, and suggests that the high diversity observed in the kinase domain is due to tight linkage to the s-domain rather than to direct exposure to positive selection.

RESULTS
sequences obtained
according to phylogenetic clustering with published sequences in a. lyrata, the sequences obtained corresponded to twenty new putative a. halleri s-alleles and to six separate loci belonging to the brassicaceae s gene family, namely aly <dig>  aly <dig>  aly <dig>  aly <dig> , aly13- <dig> and aly13- <dig> . linkage to a kinase domain was demonstrated for alleles ahsrk <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . for  <dig> of the  <dig> putative s-alleles in a. halleri, we found a matching sequence with high similarity at the s-locus in a. lyrata . sequences from this study have genbank accession numbers eu075124â€“eu <dig>  see additional file  <dig> 

note : since different primer combinations amplifying different sets of alleles were used for different individuals, the data from this table cannot be used to compare allele frequencies among populations.

co-segregation of four putative srk alleles and linkage to incompatibility phenotype
offspring from a controlled interspecific cross between an a. lyrata plant with genotype alsrk14/alsrk <dig> and an a. halleri pollen donor with genotype ahsrk15/ahsrk <dig> demonstrated strict co-segregation of the two pairs of putative srk alleles, although with segregation ratios substantially different from the expected 1: <dig> ratio: alsrk14/alsrk <dig> with a ratio 39: <dig> and ahsrk15/ahsrk <dig> with a ratio 43: <dig>  segregation bias among s-alleles has already been reported in  <cit> .

incompatibility reactions were tested for ten progeny plants from the interspecific cross, including  <dig> or more of each of the four srk genotypes.  <dig> pollinations involved plants whose putative genotypes predict compatibility , and for these fruit set was  <dig> %.  <dig> pollinations involved plants whose putative genotypes predict cross-incompatibility, and the mean fruit set was  <dig> %. these results provided direct evidence that ahsrk <dig> and ahsrk <dig> are functional srk alleles in a. halleri, and confirmed that alsrk <dig> and alsrk <dig> are functional srk alleles in a. lyrata.

sequence polymorphism
the region sequenced spans three of the four different hypervariable regions  defined in brassica  <cit> . aligned protein sequences were variable in length, differing by as much as  <dig> amino acid residues . there was no stop codon in any of the sequences. only  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid sites were conserved over all sequences,  <dig> being identical in state with the brassica sequence bosrk <dig>  twelve of these conserved residues were cystein residues at identical locations as those described in brassica by  <cit> . the  <dig> sequences contained on average  <dig>  predicted n-linked glycosylation sites per sequence. of these, two sites  were highly conserved, being shared by all  <dig> sequences with a single exception for the latter . a third site  was partially conserved, being shared by  <dig> sequences. the sliding window analysis revealed that the three hypervariable regions defined in brassica also showed elevated diversity in a. halleri and a. lyrata . however, since the baseline nucleotide diversity outside hypervariable regions was also strikingly higher in a. halleri and a. lyrata than in brassica, the peaks of diversity in hypervariable regions tended to be less pronounced.

diversity also varied along the different exons of the gene. non-synonymous diversity was higher in the s-domain  than in the rest of the gene, and tended to decrease with increasing physical distance from the s-domain, reaching as low a value as Ï€n =  <dig>  in exon  <dig>  in contrast, although synonymous diversity was higher in the s-domain  than in the kinase domain , diversity remained high throughout the kinase domain , such that no decrease was apparent with increasing physical distance from the s-domain. we found no evidence in any of the three species for a significant correlation between linkage disequilibrium  and distance between variable sites , indicating no strong effect of recombination between srk haplotypes.

s and n are, respectively, the average numbers of potentially synonymous and non-synonymous sites analyzed. Ï€, Ï€ s and Ï€ n are total, synonymous and non-synonymous diversities, respectively. all diversity estimates were jukes & cantor corrected.

sites under positive selection
in all three taxa, model m <dig> provided a significantly better fit to the data than either model m <dig> or model m8a , thus revealing the presence of positively selected codons along the s-domain of srk. in a. halleri, after excluding sites with a gap in any of the sequences, the sequences spanned over  <dig> codons, including  <dig> codons from hv <dig>   <dig> from hv <dig> and  <dig> from cvr. overall,  <dig> codons showed evidence for positive selection in a. halleri . of these,  <dig> were within hv <dig> , none in hv <dig> and one in cvr , the remaining  <dig> codons  being outside hv regions. given the relative proportion of hv regions along the sequences, this represents a highly significant clustering of sites within hv regions and cvr . in a. lyrata,  <dig> codon sites contained no gap in any of the sequences, and  <dig> sites had a high  probability of belonging to the Ï‰ >  <dig> category . again, there was a significant clustering of these sites into hv regions and cvr . in brassica, we reanalysed the data in  <cit>  but restricted the dataset to the codon positions sequenced in a. halleri and excluded two a. lyrata sequences used in this study. after alignment,  <dig> codon sites contained no gap in any of the sequences, and  <dig> sites had a high  probability of belonging to the Ï‰ >  <dig> category . all of these sites except 413e were included in the  <cit>  results, and only three of the  <dig> sites identified by  <cit>  remained undetected by the present analysis . thus, although based on a more restricted stretch of sequence in the s-domain , our results were very consistent with those of  <cit> . interestingly, one of the discrepant sites  was identified in a. halleri and a. lyrata, suggesting that part of the differences observed may have been due to the inclusion of the two divergent a. lyrata sequences in the  <cit>  analysis. again, there was in brassica a significant clustering of these sites into hv regions and cvr . strikingly, however, a large proportion of these sites in brassica  were within hv <dig>  while hv <dig> contained a single positively selected site in a. lyrata and none in a. halleri. overall,  <dig> positively selected sites were detected in at least one of the three taxa . the "fixed sites" model implemented in hyphy further confirmed that selection was stronger in hv regions and cvr than in the rest of the protein , since allowing Ï‰ to vary between hv regions and the rest of the protein significantly improved the likelihood of the model . this difference was not due to synonymous rate variation, since allowing ds alone to vary between hv regions and the rest of the protein did not significantly improve the likelihood of the model .

analysis of the subset of longer sequences in a. halleri including both the s- and the kinase domains using model m <dig> revealed that eight of the  <dig> codons analyzed  belonged to the maximum likelihood "positively selected" category. consistent with  <cit> , all of these codons were from the s-domain, and none of them were from the kinase domain. since only six kinase domain sequences were available in a. halleri, the analysis had low power and none of these sites had a posterior beb probability of belonging to the Ï‰ >  <dig> category above  <dig> .

these results were robust to both model specifications  and uncertainties in phylogenetic reconstruction. one,  <dig>  and  <dig> sites were retrieved by m <dig>  but were not retrieved by m2a  in brassica, a. halleri and a. lyrata, respectively, while sites retrieved by m2a were in all three taxa subsets of those retrieved by m <dig>  thus, in all three taxa, both models returned very similar sets of sites, except that m2a returned a lower number of sites, presumably due to lower power. results were also robust to uncertainties in the phylogenetic reconstruction. the 95% credible set of trees was of different size in the three taxa, with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> trees in a. halleri, brassica and a. lyrata, respectively. in a. halleri, the maximum likelihood "positively selected" category was very similar across the five credible topologies, with only minor differences apparent in the posterior beb probabilities . in brassica, the analysis of ten trees randomly chosen from the  <dig> credible set consistently recovered  <dig> of the twelve sites identified by the beb procedure using the ml-tree. the higher uncertainty in the phylogenetic reconstruction in a. lyrata  apparently led to a higher level of uncertainty in the identification of sites, since only eight of the  <dig> sites were consistently identified using ten randomly chosen trees from the credible set.

as shown on fig.  <dig>  a single site  was consistently identified as evolving under positive selection in all three species, while most sites were only identified in a single species or in two different species. of the  <dig> sites identified in a. halleri, only  <dig>  were also identified in brassica. similarly, of the  <dig> sites identified in a. lyrata, only  <dig>  were also identified in brassica. although the concordance between a. halleri and a. lyrata was higher , this may still be considered very low given the close phylogenetic proximity of these two species. interestingly, posterior Ï‰ estimates for these sites also differed greatly among taxa. codon sites in brassica with a high  probability of belonging to the Ï‰ >  <dig> category had a beb posterior Ï‰ of  <dig>  . in sharp contrast, the beb posterior Ï‰s were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in a. halleri and a. lyrata, respectively, i.e. about two times smaller .

simulations
simulations in evolver revealed that this low level of concordance was indeed expected given the method's low power and the large divergence among srk sequences. all sequences from the three species  were used to obtain the phylogeny shown on fig. 1b. the maximum likelihood analysis with codeml identified that  <dig> % of the  <dig> sites  were evolving under Ï‰ =  <dig>  > <dig>  these values, along with the estimated codon equilibrium frequency, Ï‰ distribution , tree length  and transition/transversion ratio , were used to simulate  <dig> replicates of the evolution of  <dig> sequences. these simulations first confirmed that the method was highly accurate at this high level of divergence. analysing simulations run with no site in the Ï‰ >  <dig> category , we found that accuracy was indeed consistently high , suggesting that sites classified with high probability  into the Ï‰ >  <dig> category were unlikely to be false positives. however, the power of the analysis was apparently low when analyzing a single taxon at a time, since only  <dig> %,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of sites simulated as positively selected were effectively detected in brassica, a. halleri, and a. lyrata respectively. in contrast, the multi-species screen had substantially higher power. on average, collectively considering all sites detected by at least one of the three taxa allowed us to effectively identify  <dig> % of all positively selected sites. this increased power of the multi-species screen was accompanied by a slight decrease of accuracy to  <dig> , still suggesting that the identification of sites in the Ï‰ >  <dig> category was reliable.

although selective constraints were identical across the three taxa in the simulations , the match between sites identified in the three taxa was surprisingly poor and comparable to the observed match. thus, in the simulations, an average of  <dig> % of sites detected in a. halleri were also identified in a. lyrata,  <dig> % of sites detected in a. halleri were also identified in brassica and  <dig> % of sites detected in a. lyrata were also identified in brassica. none of these simulated levels of concordance differed significantly from the observed levels . thus, separately analyzing such divergent sequences from three taxa that evolved under identical evolutionary constraints indeed led to the identification of different codon sites in the different taxa, and the observed low concordance was within the expected range. as shown in fig.  <dig>  there was also no evidence that sequence divergence alone could be responsible for the observed variation in posterior Ï‰ among the three taxa. in the simulations, ratios among estimated posterior Ï‰s in the three taxa never even approached the observed value of  <dig>  .

simulations of sequence evolution with different tree lengths confirmed that the low level of concordance was partly due to overall low statistical power. the number of detected sites remained in all cases much lower  than the actual number of sites simulated as evolving under positive selection , thus confirming that the method had low power . consistent with  <cit> , our simulations showed that power was initially low when sequences were only slightly divergent , then increased at intermediate levels of divergence and then started to decrease again when sequence divergence reached saturation. interestingly, the observed level of sequence divergence in a. halleri and a. lyrata was almost coincident with the peak of maximal power, while for brassica, maximum power was attained at higher sequence divergence than actually observed. tree length also had no detectable effect on accuracy, since there was no increase in the rate of false positives with sequence divergence . these results suggested that high sequence divergence would result in lower power, but without increasing the rate of false positives.

discussion
twenty-two srk sequences in a. halleri
combining results from this study with those from  <cit> , a total of twenty-two s-alleles have been identified and sequenced in a. halleri, together with several other members of the s-gene family previously identified in a. lyrata. co-segregation and linkage to the incompatibility phenotype has been demonstrated for the eight s-alleles tested . by tracing recombinants in a backcross involving a f <dig> hybrid between a. halleri and a. lyrata with genotype ahsrk01/alsrk <dig>   <cit>  also demonstrated that the functional s-locus is localized at a position analogous to the Ïˆsrk position in a. thaliana  <cit> . these observations are particularly important because  <cit>  showed that srk sequences in a. lyrata do not show 100% monophyly, as two unlinked sequences  were found to be nested within the srk cluster. our results confirm that these two sequences seem to be exceptions, since all other putative srk sequences that have been identified and tested have proven to be linked to self-incompatibility . consistent with these sequences belonging to srk, and thus evolving under strong balancing selection causing long coalescence times  <cit> , we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> putative s-alleles in a. halleri form trans-specific pairs with high similarity with s-alleles sequences from a. lyrata. overall, the level of diversity among putative s-alleles in a. halleri is comparable to that reported for srk haplotypes in a. lyrata  <cit> .

indeed, this level of diversity is the highest ever-reported in a. halleri, both in terms of the number of different haplotypes  and in terms of sequence polymorphism. the most exhaustive study of sequence polymorphism to date in a. halleri reported a mean silent nucleotide diversity Ï€s =  <dig>   across eight independent genes, while we observed Ï€s =  <dig>  in exon  <dig> of srk, i.e. a  <dig> fold increase in diversity. analyzing the pattern of variation across the whole gene, we see no clear relationship between synonymous nucleotide diversity and distance from the s-domain, as noted already by  <cit>  in a. lyrata. as we also showed that positively selected sites are only occurring in exon  <dig>  this suggests that the high diversity observed in exons  <dig> to  <dig> is due to genetic hitchhiking and also that intragenic recombination is very low.

how many sites evolve under positive selection?
the paml approach has been extremely successful in revealing protein evolution in a variety of situations. our study empirically demonstrates the limits but still usefulness of this approach in a case of extreme sequence divergence. although the power of the analysis was low in any of the three taxa, the accuracy remained very high. this observation is consistent with results of a simulation study by  <cit> , who revealed that the accuracy remained high and that increasing the number of lineages was the best way to increase statistical power, even at high levels of divergence. our approach, combining sets of sites revealed by at least one taxon  was apparently more powerful than defining the set of sites from a single dataset containing all three taxa , so we conclude that  <dig> codon sites over  <dig>  are identified as evolving under positive selection. because of limited statistical power of the analysis, however, this represents only a fraction of all sites truly evolving under positive selection. our simulations allowed us to estimate that the power of this multi-species screen was  <dig> %. by extrapolation, we thus estimate that 25/ <dig>  =  <dig>  of the  <dig> codon sites have evolved under positive selection, i.e. almost a quarter of the sites in the sequence could be involved in recognition. this proportion is higher than that reported in  <cit>  in brassica  and also higher than those recently reported in the gametophytic self-incompatibility pollen sfb gene in prunus spinosa  and the gametophytic self-incompatibility pistil s-rnase gene in lycium parishii . as we showed here, a possible explanation for this difference is that the screens used in these studies may also have had low power. collectively, these results thus indicate that a large proportion of sites in self-incompatibility genes are probably involved in the molecular interaction determining compatibility.

location of sites under positive selection
because of the low level of false positives revealed by our simulations, sites belonging to the Ï‰ >  <dig> category should be considered as reliable candidates for further functional analyses. these codons were strongly clustered in hypervariable regions, and we checked that this observation was not an artifact due to variation in evolution rate at synonymous sites. our results thus support previous claims of the functional importance of hypervariable regions  <cit> . interestingly, however, their distribution across hv <dig>  hv <dig> and cvr differed strongly among the three taxa, with hv <dig> containing most sites detected in brassica, while this region contained a very low number of positively selected sites in a. halleri and a. lyrata. in line with  <cit> , this raises the intriguing possibility that functionally important parts of the proteins may differ along different allelic lineages. however, although our simulation approach demonstrated that the number of false positives remained very low, it also demonstrated that such a poor concordance among sites identified in different taxa is consistent with the analysis of highly divergent sequences.

more intense selection in brassica ?
our study also revealed that the observed higher posterior Ï‰ estimate in brassica as compared to a. halleri and a. lyrata was outside the expected range of random variation computed from simulations, possibly suggesting more intense selection in brassica. how should higher posterior Ï‰ in brassica as compared to a. halleri and a. lyrata be interpreted biologically? all three taxa most probably inherited a common set of alleles from their ancestor. although the number of alleles is comparably high in the three taxa, brassica alleles cluster in two main lineages, whereas all a. halleri and a. lyrata alleles are highly divergent from one another. a possible explanation for this difference is that the genus brassica went through a severe bottleneck that drastically reduced the number of alleles. as noted by  <cit> , the intensity of balancing selection on an s-locus is inversely related to the number of alleles in a population. thus, balancing selection may have been very intense, leading to strong selection for allelic diversification shortly after the putative bottleneck. how strong a bottleneck can generate such a difference in posterior Ï‰ remains to be determined.

balancing vs. positive selection: exploring the limits of paml
although phylogenetic methods to detect natural selection on protein coding sequences have initially been developed for between-species comparisons, there is an increasing interest in adapting these methods to the analysis of intraspecific polymorphism. our data can be used to evaluate some limits of this approach.

a first limit is that our simulation procedure assumed a constant Ï‰ for each codon across the whole phylogeny. this is unlikely to be true, since frequency-dependent selection implies that an allele's selection regime varies together with its frequency. indeed, a newly arisen allele initially experiences positive selection as long as it remains below its equilibrium frequency. once equilibrium has been reached, the allele is then actively maintained by balancing selection, not positive selection anymore. Ï‰ values are thus expected to change along each branch of the phylogeny, such that their precise interpretation is unclear in the context of frequency-dependent selection.

a second limit is that our approach assumes no recombination. simulations by  <cit>  have shown that the presence of recombination affects the power to detect selection because paml assumes a single tree for the whole protein, whereas recombination leads to different gene genealogies in different regions of the gene. currently available methods to estimate jointly recombination and selective pressures along the gene  rely on explicit population genetics models, while we obtained a single sequence for each srk haplotype in the whole species. accurate allele frequency data are thus not available, currently preventing us from taking recombination formally into account. although we acknowledge that this will be important once appropriate data are available, we think that recombination is probably not causing bias in the analyses for the following reasons. as shown by  <cit> , paml is indeed relatively tolerant for a certain range in the recombination rate, especially with models m <dig> and m <dig>  in addition, the existence of separate genes for the pollen and pistil recognition functions apparently causes suppressed recombination to maintain coadapted sets of the two different loci. accordingly, comparison between physical and genetic maps of the chromosome carrying the s-locus indeed showed reduced recombination in the si region in a. lyrata  <cit> . in line with  <cit> , reduced recombination is compatible with our observation of no significant decrease of ld across the s-domain as well as with a strong hitchhiking effect on synonymous nucleotide variation throughout the kinase domain of srk.

a third limit of the parametric bootstrap approach used to investigate power and accuracy is that it relies on parameters estimated from the data. given the important divergence observed among sequences, saturation is likely to occur and divergence is probably the most poorly estimated parameter of our analysis. in particular, the length of the long internal branches of the tree used to simulate sequence evolution is probably poorly estimated. in addition, the three taxa analyzed have very contrasted allelic phylogenies. brassica has a single long internal branch separating the two dominance classes, while a. lyrata and a. halleri have numerous long branches, so the number of non-synonymous substitutions may be underestimated more severely in a. lyrata and a. halleri than in brassica, thus providing a potential explanation for the lower Ï‰ in a. halleri or a. lyrata than in brassica. could uncertainty in branch length estimation have affected our conclusions? our simulations revealed that power declined with sequence divergence more quickly than accuracy of the posterior Ï‰ estimation. thus, the signal of positive selection was lost before any bias in the beb posterior Ï‰ estimation could be detected. our simulation approach mimics the generation of real datasets, such that any bias due to saturation would be present in both real and simulated datasets, making the comparison robust to such effects.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first report of sequence polymorphism at the female specificity determinant gene srk in the self-incompatible arabidopsis halleri. sequence polymorphism was extremely high, and twenty-five codons showed signs of positive selection in either a. halleri, a. lyrata or brassica. using simulations, we demonstrate that the signature of balancing selection can be identified reliably at the codon level and estimate that over 20% of all codons in the s-domain may actually be involved in recognition. brassica had higher posterior rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions than either a. halleri or a. lyrata, possibly suggesting that allelic diversification in this genus was both more recent and more intense than in either a. halleri or a. lyrata.
