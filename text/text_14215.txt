BACKGROUND
with the advent of modern metabolomics techniques, hundreds of endogenous organic compounds  from tissue samples, cell cultures and body fluids can now be measured in a highly standardized and often non-targeted manner. current technologies are based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry , gas chromatography–mass spectrometry , flow injection analysis mass spectrometry  or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
 <cit> . genome-wide association studies  with large numbers of metabolic traits and metabolome-wide association studies  with a wide range of biomedical relevant traits are enabled by the newly achieved high-throughput metabolomics capabilities.

specific ratios between selected pairs of metabolite concentrations  have been introduced in the past as biomarkers in many biomedical applications. for instance, medium-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency  is detected in systematic “newborn screens” on the basis of elevated blood concentrations of octanoylcarnitine  and other acylcarnitines, in combination with ratios between acylcarnitine concentrations, including hexanoylcarnitine , decanoylcarnitine , decenoylcarnitine , c8/c <dig>  c8/c <dig>  and c8/c <dig> 
 <cit> . the ratio between blood phenylalanine to tyrosine concentrations is used to identify heterozygous carriers of phenylketonuria  risk alleles
 <cit> . metabolite ratios are also used as biomarkers to detect specific exposures. for instance, the urinary hydroxyproline to creatinine ratio was proposed as an indicator for personal nitrogen dioxide  exposure
 <cit> .

with modern high-throughput technologies, the concept of metabolite ratio analysis has been scaled up to systematically analyzing all possible combinations of ratios between metabolite pairs in a hypothesis-free approach. a number of recently published papers highlight the power of this approach: altmaier et al. <cit>  applied hypothesis-free metabolite ratio analysis to pre-clinical drug testing in diabetic mice. they linked ratios between sphingolipids that differ by two carbon moieties to a modified beta-oxidation and ratios between different classes of phospholipids to modified activity of enzymes in the phospholipid pathways. in a metabolite association study with smoking, wang-sattler et al. <cit>  identified an association with ratios between ester- and ether-bond phospholipids. the biochemical properties of these phospholipids allowed pinpointing the association to the enzymatic action of alkylglycerone phosphate synthase. using similar approaches, altmaier et al. <cit>  identified biochemically relevant associations between metabolite ratios and self-reported nutrition habits, and suhre et al. <cit>  used metabolite ratios to identify functional biomarkers for pre-clinical drug testing of fabp <dig> inhibitors. gieger et al. <cit> , illig et al. <cit>  and suhre et al.
 <cit>  introduced hypothesis-free testing of metabolite ratios to gwas. they showed that using ratios can increase the power of gwas by tens of orders of magnitude. the leading metabolic traits in  <dig> out of  <dig> genetic associations reported by illig et al. <cit>  and  <dig> out  <dig> associations by suhre et al.
 <cit>  are ratios between metabolite concentrations . most interestingly, they found that the biochemical nature of the associating metabolite pairs was in nearly all cases directly related to the biochemical function of an enzyme or transporter gene that was encoded at the respective loci. 

in all studies pairs of metabolites were identified by a high increase in the strength of association when ratios were used. note that all of these metabolite pairs are found to be biochemically related to the concrete biological questions of these studies . however, they were singled out from the large number of all possible metabolite pair combinations on the basis of the p-gain without any prior hypotheses.

several reasons explain why metabolite ratios provide additional information in these association studies:  ratios between related metabolite pairs reduce the overall biological variability in the dataset and thereby increase statistical power. for instance, study participants may have strongly varying nutrition habits, which introduce high variance in the distribution of that nutrient, but also in those of its biochemical break-down products. however, individuals who consume a higher amount of a certain nutrient also exhibit higher levels of its biochemical break-down products. ratios between these metabolites can thus be considered as some kind of internal normalization.  systematic experimental errors, such as variance in the concentration of external standards result in errors that are comparable for certain metabolite pairs. such errors are cancelled out in ratios and thereby reduce the overall noise in the dataset.  probably most importantly, when a metabolite pair is connected by a biochemical pathway, metabolite ratios approximate the corresponding reaction rate under idealized steady state assumptions. metabolite ratios then represent a biologically most relevant entity, namely the flux through a biochemical pathway. for example, in suhre et al. <cit> , the association of snp rs <dig> at the fads <dig> locus displayed a p-value of p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and an explained variance of  <dig>  % with concentrations of the omega- <dig> fatty acid 20: <dig>  whereas the p-value of association with ratios between the fatty acids 20: <dig> and 20: <dig> was p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> with an explained variance of  <dig>  %
 <cit> . the fads <dig> locus encodes a fatty acid delta- <dig> desaturase. this is a key enzyme in the metabolism of long chain polyunsaturated omega- <dig> and omega- <dig> fatty acids. the fatty acids 20: <dig> and 20: <dig> are the respective product and substrate pair of the fads <dig> reaction
 <cit> . the p-gain is defined as the increase in the strength of association, expressed as the change in p-value when using ratios compared to the smaller of the two p-values when using two metabolite concentrations individually. so far, the number of analyzed metabolite concentrations was applied as an ad-hoc critical value for the p-gain. any association that displayed a p-gain below this number was considered to have occurred by chance. this approach can merely be regarded as an intuitive rule of thumb, since a statistical determination of the distribution of the p-gain and herewith of the critical values has not yet been conducted. in this paper, we derive critical values through determination of the distribution of the p-gain and provide a density table for readout of critical values. in addition, we investigate the characteristics of the p-gain in the situation of bonferroni correction for multiple tests.

RESULTS
formal definition of the p-gain
testing ratios between two metabolite concentrations a and b should be independent of their order. it is therefore advisable to use log-scaled metabolite ratios in the tests for association. due to the property log = -log this also halves the multiple testing burden. moreover, in many of the cases we tested, the distribution of metabolite ratios was observed to be better represented by a log-normal distribution than by a normal distribution. for instance, a test of normality in the study by illig et al. <cit>  showed that in  <dig>  % of the cases, the log-transformed ratio distribution was significantly better represented by a normal distribution than when untransformed ratios were used.

the p-gain was introduced in order to measure whether the association with a genetic locus is significantly stronger for a metabolite ratio than for the belonging metabolite concentrations. as notation, we use ‘p-value’, short ‘p’, to reference the p-value corresponding to a test for association between a trait x  and the metabolite m <dig>  with this definition, the p-gain for the association of the ratio m1/m <dig> of metabolites m <dig> and m <dig> with a trait x is defined as

  p‐gain:=min,p‐value)p‐value 

conservative critical p-gain values for common statistics
although the p-gain is now frequently used in mwas and in gwas with metabolic traits, only a rule of thumb for the determination of critical values has been applied so far. the p-gain was considered as being significant when its value exceeded the number of analyzed metabolite concentrations, that is, the number of additionally performed tests
 <cit> . here we derive critical values of the p-gain by determination of the distribution to define a more sensible threshold. as the distribution of the p-gain depends on the correlation structure among the metabolites, conservative critical values are beneficial in case of analyzing multiple sets of metabolites, since they can be applied to all analyzed settings. for this purpose, we use a universal p-gain defined as the ratio of p-values belonging to two uncorrelated metabolites:

  p‐gainm1m2|x:=p‐valuep‐value,cor= <dig> 

critical values of the distribution of this p-gain are conservative to the critical values of the distribution of the p-gain given in equation , because

 p‐value≥min,p‐value) 

and therefore 

 p‐valuep‐value≥min,p‐value)p‐value 

the variation of the distribution of the p-gain defined in equation  depends on the correlation between m <dig> and m1/m <dig>  for example, highly correlated metabolic traits contain mainly the same information and have similar p-values in association tests. this results in p-gain values which are close to one. hence, the variation of the distribution is small. in contrast, weakly correlated metabolic traits contain different information and may have different p-values in association tests. this results in p-gain values distributed broadly around the one. therefore, assuming
cor= <dig>  as it was done in equation , results in a distribution of the p-gain with largest possible variation and leads to the most conservative critical values.

in the situation of the universalized p-gain ) we can use the convolution formula for density ratios which yields a split density :

  fpp={120<p-gain<112⋅p-gain2p-gain≥ <dig> 

as displayed in figure
 <dig> . to determine critical values, we derive the cumulative distribution function of the density, i.e.

  fpp=∫0p‐gainfppdx={12p‐gain0<p‐gain<11−12·p‐gainp‐gain≥ <dig> 

herewith, the critical value becomes
12⋅α with α denoting the level of significance. in the case of typically used α levels of  <dig> , this yields a corresponding critical value for the p-gain of ten. general quantiles are provided in table s <dig> .

critical values for multiple testing
in mwas and in gwas with metabolomics a large number of ratios are tested in parallel. therefore, a correction for multiple testing has to be applied. we select bonferroni correction as the most conservative method. when admitting a type i error rate of α and applying a correction for b tests, i.e. aiming at a level of significance of
α/b, the critical value for the p-gain then becomes
b/ . for example, assumption of a type i error rate of α =  <dig>  leads to a critical value of
10⋅bwhich implies that for bonferroni correction of b tests the uncorrected critical value of ten can be multiplied by the number of tests b. hence, the critical value of the p-gain in the situation of multiple testing is not equal to the number of analyzed metabolite concentrations, which was used so far as an ad-hoc criterion, but rather ten times the number of tested ratios.

p-gain for correlated metabolites
the case of uncorrelated metabolites ) is conservative with respect to the p-gain as defined in equation . here we analyze the density of the p-gain as defined in equation  for selected correlation settings. in the situation of correlated metabolic traits the convolution formula cannot be applied anymore. thus, we simulate the density using a copula to generate the correlation among the metabolic traits. a copula is a joint probability distribution whose one-dimensional marginal distributions are uniformly distributed over the interval  <cit> . it takes the dependency among the marginal distributions into account . quantiles for the p-gain densities of correlated metabolic traits are provided in table s <dig>  for various correlation settings. it can be observed that when any of the correlations cor or cor increase, the values of the quantiles of the p-gain decrease. this observation can be explained by the fact that the variation of the p-gain can be reduced by increasing the correlation between a metabolite concentration and the ratio  or cor). a reduction of the variation of the p-gain leads to smaller critical values. on the other hand, for fixed cor or cor, an increase in the correlation between m <dig> and m <dig> leads to an increase in the values for the p-gain quantiles when the correlation between m <dig> and m <dig> is not close to  <dig>  extending these observations to the most extreme case of having fully correlated metabolite concentrations which are uncorrelated with their ratio  =  <dig>  cor =  <dig>  cor = 0) we get the largest critical values and thus these critical values are conservative to all correlation settings. this idealized case reduces the p-gain as defined in equation  to the p-gain as defined in equation . for this case, we derived the distribution using the convolution formula as well as through a simulation. in both cases, the simulated and calculated density as well as the belonging critical values coincided ). to determine the density of the p-gain for a given correlation setting among the metabolite concentrations and their ratio, the exact distribution of the p-gain for a given metabolite ratio can be simulated using the r-script which is provided as supplemental material .

dependence on sample size in real data
in order to examine the behavior of the p-gain in the situation of real data, we compute the observed correlation structure among metabolite ratios which were published in suhre et al. <cit>  . this dataset includes nearly uncorrelated metabolites, such as the ratio between 1-methylxanthine and 4-acetamidobutanoate  as well as highly correlated metabolites, such as the androsterone sulfate to epiandrosterone sulfate ratio . the distributions of exemplary metabolite ratios are presented in figure
 <dig>  as expected, the densities for correlated metabolic traits display smaller variations than the density for uncorrelated metabolic traits. the observed p-gain values in  <dig>  samples of the kora study vary between  <dig>  x  <dig> and  <dig>  x  <dig> for the  <dig> loci published in suhre et al. ). using this dataset we conducted simulation tests to address the influence of the sample size on the observed p-gain values. we chose randomly sets of samples sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> samples from the kora study and calculated the p-gain for these sets. the results of this analysis illustrate the dependence of the p-gain values on the sample size ). for example, we observe for the association between the acads locus and the butyrylcarnitine to propionylcarnitine ratio a median p-gain value of  <dig>  x  <dig> for a sample size of n =  <dig>  of  <dig>  x  <dig> for n =  <dig>  of  <dig>  x  <dig> for n =  <dig>  of  <dig>  x  <dig> for n =  <dig> and of  <dig>  x  <dig> for n =  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we derived critical values for the p-gain to determine significance in various situations. we recommend the use of metabolite ratios and the p-gain statistic when analyzing large scale metabolomics data sets and to apply the critical values with correction of multiple testing as provided in this paper. given the success of the approach in the metabolomics field, hypothesis free testing of ratios between biologically related quantitative traits should also be considered for association studies with other ‘omics datasets.
