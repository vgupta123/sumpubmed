BACKGROUND
during early embryogenesis, the zygotic nucleolus assembles from a ground state following the disassembly of the maternal nucleolus after pronuclear fusion  <cit> . "de novo" nucleologenesis begins in the mouse at the end of the 2nd cell cycle with the initiation of ribosomal rna transcription. an early morphological intermediate of the reforming nucleolus is the nucleolus precursor body   <cit> . the npb can be detected through the morula stage, after which it progressively adopts the classic tripartite morphology as seen in the blastocyst and thereafter. ribosomal rna transcription begins on the surface of the sphere, where the nucleolar organizing regions  of the genome are located  <cit> . in contrast to somatic  nucleologenesis, the mechanism and role in development of de novo nucleologenesis are not well understood.

the role of nucleolar proteins during early mouse development has been investigated by gene targeting in the mouse. in virtually all cases, genetic ablation of protein function results in developmental arrest prior to birth, but at stages that might not be predictable a priori based on the encoded protein's function. for example, in embryos mutant for the proteins involved in ribosomal rna synthesis or processing, such as pescadillo- <dig>   <cit> , fibrillarin  <cit> , rna polymerase 1– <dig>  <cit>  and surf <dig>  <cit> , arrest occurs at the morula stage. however, in the tif1a mutant, which ablates a protein mediating the earlier process of rrna transcription, arrest occurs after implantation  <cit> . knockout of b23/nucleophosmin, which is required for rrna processing and also chromosome segregation, arrested development between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> . a unifying feature in all these mutant embryos was disruption of the nucleolus and increased apoptosis. it remains unclear to what extent mutant phenotypes arise from a shortage of ribosomes or from stress signals originating from a dysfunctional nucleolus.

here we studied the role of rbm <dig> during early mouse embryonic development. rbm <dig> is a conserved nucleolar protein distinguished by its  <dig> rna recognition motifs   <cit> . it has been implicated in processing pre-ribosomal rna  <cit> . it was also found to be essential for digestive organ development in the zebrafish in two independent genetic screens  <cit> , and is expressed preferentially in the progenitor compartment of the mammalian intestine  <cit> . to assess its function during mouse development, we generated a mutant containing a gene-trap insertion into the rbm <dig> locus. as described below, we found that rbm <dig> is required for preimplantation development.

RESULTS
molecular characterization of the rbm19xc <dig> mutation
we identified an es cell line containing a gene-trap insertion in the rbm <dig> locus rbm19gtxc <dig>  by searching the baygenomics database  <cit> . the insertion is within intron  <dig> and predicted to create a transcript that joins the sequences from exon  <dig> to the β-galactosidase open reading frame. the exact insertion site was determined by empirically testing a series of pcr primer pairs consisting of one rbm19-specific primer and one primer to various sites in the gene trap vector. pcr products were sequenced, enabling detection of the insertion site. the gene trap message should encode a fusion protein in which the two c-terminal rrm domains are omitted and substituted with the β-galactosidase-neomycin resistance protein, leaving the four n-terminal rrm domains intact . in heterozygotes, by quantitative pcr we detected  <dig> copies of the insertion vector. these animals had been outcrossed at least  <dig> times, yielding 50% heterozygous offspring, indicating that the multiple copies are tightly linked. the most likely explanation is that multiple copies were integrated in tandem, which is known to occur with plasmid vectors such as pgt1lxf when electroporated into es cells  <cit> . since it is formally possible that the integrated dna could get excised during splicing, we characterized the transcripts produced in homozygous vs. heterozygote embryos by reverse transcriptase -pcr. using rbm19-specific primers to exons flanking the insertion site or an rbm19-specific forward primer paired with a β-geo reverse primer, we could detect both wild-type and mutant-specific bands, respectively. we detected both bands in the heterozygotes, but only the mutant band in homozygote-derived cdna.

to further demonstrate that the β-geo insertion indeed generated a fusion protein we performed a western blot on extract from duodenum of rbm19gtxc768/+ adult mice, using anti-rbm <dig> antibody directed against an epitope near the amino terminal of the protein  <cit> . as expected, we detected a distinct, albeit faint, band corresponding to the predicted size of the rbm19-β geo fusion protein ) in the heterozygote but not in the wild-type extract . we could not perform western blotting on homozygous mutant embryos due to arrest at the morula stage  and consequent lack of adequate material.

we fine-mapped the insertion site to single nucleotide resolution using a series of pcr primers complementary to mouse genomic sequences distributed across intron  <dig>  sequencing the pcr products allowed us to identify the junctions between gene-trap vector and genomic dna. we did not detect any deletions. we were then able to perform allele-specific multiplex pcr for all subsequent genotyping .

characterization of the rbm19gtxc <dig> mutant phenotype
we generated chimeric mice by blastocyst injection, and bred these to obtain founder rbm19gtxc768/+ mice. the progeny of heterozygote outcrosses were in the expected mendelian ratio  and the heterozygote mice displayed no discernible mutant phenotype, surviving beyond  <dig> years without overt pathology. interbreeding the rbm19gtxc768/+ mice yielded neither live births nor embryos prior to e <dig>  that were homozygous. at e <dig>  the intercrosses consistently yielded a mixture of morula and blastocyst-stage embryos . genotyping of these embryos demonstrated that the morula-stage embryos were homozygote mutants, whereas the blastocyst stage embryos were uniformly rbm19+/+ or rbm19gtxc768/+ . visual screening at e <dig>  was 93% predictive for genotype . prior to e <dig> , intercrosses yielded early stage embryos that were indistinguishable from each other, despite the presence of homozygote mutants among these progeny. to discern if the mutant embryos at e <dig>  were arrested at this stage or simply delayed, we cultured the embryos. normal-appearing e <dig>  embryos formed expanded blastocysts, but the e <dig>  morula-stage embryos remained arrested at the morula stage for an additional day, and then degenerated . thus the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> embryos arrest prior to forming the blastocyst. no wild-type intercrosses in the c57/bl <dig> background yielded embryos similarly delayed at e <dig> .

rbm <dig> localization during preimplantation development
to understand how the rbm <dig> protein might function during early development, we determined its subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. at the 4– <dig> cell stages we found rbm <dig> localized to discrete foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm . this result was surprising, since other nucleolar proteins such as nucleolin, fibrillarin  <cit> , nopp <dig>  <cit>  and pescadillo- <dig>   <cit>  localize to the periphery of the npb in cleavage and morula stage embryos. double staining with b <dig> confirmed that prominent npbs can be visualized at this stage, but most of the rbm <dig> does not localize to these structures. as the blastocyst forms, rbm <dig> becomes increasingly localized to the nucleolus and less to the cytoplasm. by the late blastocyst stage, when nucleologenesis is largely completed, we observed only a few cytoplasmic rbm19-positive foci, with most of the rbm <dig> protein seen in the nucleolus.

since rbm <dig> contains  <dig> rrms and has been shown to bind rna  <cit> , we considered the possibility that rbm <dig> localizes to p-bodies, which store and process maternal rna in the oocyte  <cit> . we performed double immunofluorescence staining for rbm <dig> and the p-body-specific protein gw <dig>  and found that they do not colocalize , indicating that rbm19-positive cytoplasmic foci and p-bodies are distinct structures.

nucleologenesis is disrupted in rbm19gtxc768/gt xc <dig> mutant embryos
between the morula and blastocyst stages, the npb undergoes a morphogenic transition to a mature, tripartite nucleolus  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  this transition coincides with the relocalization of rbm <dig> from cytoplasm to nucleolus, suggesting that these two processes may be linked. to test if rbm <dig> function may be required to form the mature nucleolus, we performed immunostaining for the nucleolar markers b <dig> and fibrillarin in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> embryos . the predominant b <dig> and fibrillarin staining patterns in the mutant embryos resemble that of the wild-type morula. in most cases we saw b <dig> and fibrillarin localized to large rings, consistent with the periphery of npbs. to further characterize nucleologenesis in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutants we examined the embryos using transmission electron microscopy . the mutant e <dig>  embryos lack the mature, tripartite nucleoli clearly evident in wild-type blastocysts. instead, the mutants contain spheres resembling npbs, indicating arrest of nucleologenesis.

since the nucleolus is generated by the collective action of the ribosome biogenesis apparatus, we also assessed whether rrna transcription might be impaired in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant. we measured brutp incorporation in cultured embryos by double immunofluorescence staining with anti-brdu and anti-fibrillarin antibodies . we found that both wild-type and mutant embryos incorporated brutp that colocalized with fibrillarin. this indicated that rbm <dig> is not required for the assembly of the rrna transcription apparatus on the surface of the npb.

timing of developmental arrest in rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant embryos
a feature of the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant phenotype is failure of the morula to undergo compaction . in the mutant, the margins between individual blastomeres can still be appreciated at the 16-cell stage, by which time compaction has already occurred in wild-type embryos. e-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule essential for compaction of the morula  <cit> . to test if e-cadherin is expressed and properly localized in the mutant embryos, we performed whole mount immunofluorescence staining. e-cadherin was present and appeared to be normally localized between the blastomeres , although the outline of the cells revealed irregular borders and abnormal cell shapes. this suggests that the absence or mislocalization of e-cadherin is unlikely to be the reason for failure of compaction.

to assess whether rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant embryos form the first embryonic lineages, we performed immunostaining for the lineage markers oct-3/ <dig>  nanog and cdx <dig> . normally, oct-3/ <dig> and nanog proteins are expressed in all the blastomeres of morula-stage embryos. then, in concert with morula compaction, the outer blastomeres become specified to form the trophectoderm lineage. these cells gradually lose oct-3/ <dig> and nanog expression and begin to express the trophectoderm marker cdx <dig>  in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutants, oct3/ <dig> expression is substantially diminished, whereas nanog expression remains similar to wild-type morulae. notably, there was no cdx <dig> expression detectable in the mutants, indicating that developmental arrest occurs prior to trophectoderm specification.

apoptosis of blastomeres in rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant embryos
to characterize the cellular process that leads to developmental arrest, we tested markers for apoptosis in the e <dig>  rbm19gtxc768/gtxc768mutant embryos. we performed both tunel assay and immunostaining for cleaved caspase  <dig>  and found that about 90% of the mutant nuclei were positive for both markers of apoptosis  . in contrast, the wild-type embryos showed minimal staining for tunel and only background staining for caspase  <dig>  the p <dig> tumor suppressor protein is a known inducer of apoptosis and has been shown to mediate the nucleolar stress response  <cit> . we tested the transcriptional activation of known p <dig> targets in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant embryos by semi-quantitative rt-pcr . we show that p <dig>  bax, and cycling <dig> are upregulated in the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc768mutant embryos. thus, both arms of the p <dig> effector pathway-cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-appear to be upregulated.

one possible reason for the timing of the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc768mutant phenotype is the exhaustion of maternal gene product at the 8– <dig> cell stage, assuming that rbm <dig> gene product is present prior to zygotic transcription. by rt-pcr using rna from wild-type 2-cell stage embryos we detected rbm <dig> expression . thus rbm <dig> may be required even earlier than the 8– <dig> cells stage, since the early rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant phenotype may be complemented by wild-type gene product from the heterozygote mother.

discussion
here we report that a gene-trap insertion, resulting in disruption of the nucleolar protein rbm <dig>  arrests embryonic development in the mouse prior to implantation. the mutant allele resulting from the gene trap may be partially functional, and maternal rbm <dig> rna is present in the 2-cell stage embryo, suggesting that rbm <dig> could be required even earlier than e <dig> . in somatic cells rbm <dig> is a component of the nucleolus, and the timing of arrest  coincides with the formation of the nucleolus. also, localization of rbm <dig> changes from cytoplasm to nucleolus at the same stage as developmental arrest of the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutant. the assembly of the nucleolus is a prerequisite for embryonic development  <cit> . failure of nucleologenesis could trigger a nucleolar stress response that induces cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis via activation of p <dig>  <cit>  as one of many possible mechanisms to account for the rbm19gtxc768/gtxc768mutant phenotype.

there are notable similarities and differences between rbm <dig> and other nucleolar proteins that have been studied by genetic inactivation in the mouse. several others were found to be required at the morula stage, including fibrillarin  <cit> , pes- <dig>  <cit> , surf <dig>  <cit> , bysl  <cit> , and rna polymerase 1– <dig> <cit> . these proteins all participate in various aspects of rrna synthesis or processing. thus impaired ribosome biogenesis may be the common molecular defect underlying these phenotypes. however, other genes that encode proteins essential for ribosome biogenesis do not cause morula arrest upon their mutation. for example, tif1a is essential for rrna transcription  <cit> , and its ablation in the mouse leads to nucleolar disruption and p53-mediated apoptosis  <cit> . yet, tif1a mutant embryos survive to e <dig>   and form rudiments of most organs. similarly, ablation of the b <dig> gene results in embryonic lethality and genomic instability, but the embryos survive to e <dig> -e <dig>   <cit> . thus, a ribosome biogenesis defect cannot be predicted to uniformly induce early embryonic lethality. the reason for this may be that, while nucleologenesis and ribosome biogenesis are intimately linked, there may be differential effects on one and not the other, since the nucleolus has other roles as well. it may be difficult to sort out exactly which phenotypes are attributable to a shortfall in ribosome biogenesis and which are due to induction nucleolar stress signals. since stress signals may be mediated in large by p <dig>  analyzing the effects of nucleolar protein mutations in a p <dig> null background may provide some clues. for example, genetic inactivation of p <dig> mitigated, but did not completely rescue, the loss of b <dig> in the mouse  <cit> . we have generated rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> /p53-/- double mutants and in preliminary studies it appears that loss of p <dig> does not rescue the rbm <dig> mutant phenotype.

nucleologenesis in the early embryo is first detectable upon activation of rrna transcription on the surface of the npb after the 2nd cell cycle  <cit> . the developmental events between the onset of rrna transcription and nucleolar maturation are poorly understood. nucleolar proteins studied to date localize to the surface of the nucleolar precursor body   <cit> . we show that rbm <dig> protein does not conform to this localization pattern, but instead remains in the cytoplasm through the morula stage, then localizes to the nucleolus in the blastocyst. this would suggest that rbm <dig> plays a role the early embryo distinct from its previously characterized function in rrna processing. one possible role might be coordinating other nucleolar proteins for transport to the nucleus, to insure proper nucleolar assembly  <cit> .

our finding that cdx <dig> expression is completely absent in rbm19gtxc768/gtxc <dig> mutants identifies the first lineage specification event in the embryo as the stage at which developmental arrest occurs. it is tempting to speculate that the nucleolus plays a permissive role in regulating this developmental step. according to such a model, the developmental program may utilize the forming nucleolus as a sensor of normal development. if nucleologenesis is indeed determinative, failure of this process may represent one reason for arrest prior to implantation.

CONCLUSIONS
the rbm19gtxc <dig> mutation induces arrest of development as the nucleolus is maturing. since nucleolar maturation occurs coincident with the stage-specific localization of rbm <dig> from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus, the underlying cause of arrest may be failure of nucleologenesis in concert with a p53-mediated stress response.
