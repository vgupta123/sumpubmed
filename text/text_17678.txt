BACKGROUND
to date,  <dig> mitochondrial genomes in seed plants have been fully sequenced and analyzed http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/. these mitochondrial genomes are extremely variable in size, ranging from 221 kb  to  <dig>  kb . sequence analysis revealed that the most abundant portion of the mitochondrial genomes is non-coding  <cit> , which includes “promiscuous” dna of plastid and nuclear origin  <cit> , as well as sequences of horizontal origin from foreign genomes  <cit> . structural analysis, through use of southern hybridization or paired-end data, revealed a high frequency of intra- and intermolecular recombination due to accumulation of repetitive sequences. this process has generated a structurally dynamic assemblage of genome configurations within a species  <cit>  and a scrambling of gene order within closely related species  <cit> . this dynamic organization of the plant mitochondrial genome provides a powerful model for the study of genome structure and evolution. in addition, the increasing availability of plant organelle and nuclear genome sequence data provides an understanding of the mechanisms driving plant genome evolution. indeed, there is a strong structural and functional interaction among plastid, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes  <cit> . transfer of dna among these three compartments in higher plants has been reported, with exception of transfer into the plastid genome  <cit> .

despite its importance, technical obstacles of dna isolation and sequence assembly limit the sequencing of mitochondrial genomes. conventional approaches to mitochondrial genome sequencing involve extraction and enrichment of mitochondrial dna, cloning, and sequencing. large repeats and the dynamic mitochondrial genome organization complicate sequence assembly.

the development of next generation sequencing technologies , such as the roche and illumina platforms, provides a new opportunity for rapid characterization of mitochondrial genomes. non-enriched whole genome dna libraries, both shotgun and paired-end, include plastid and mitochondrial dna that is sequenced along with the nuclear dna during the sequencing run. ngs technologies have already been used for sequencing the small mitochondrial genome of nematodes  <cit> , human  <cit>  and fish  <cit>  with no library enrichment. recently, sequencing data from non-enriched libraries has been successfully used to assemble plastid genomes of wild and domesticated rice, mung bean, date palm, and milkweed  <cit> . the major limitations for use of this approach on de-novo assembly of mitochondrial genomes are the ability to overcome assembly problems related to large repeat regions, presence of promiscuous dna, and sequence ambiguity due to sequencing technologies.

the aim of this study was to demonstrate how next generation sequence data from total genomic dna can be used to de-novo assemble the mitochondrial genome of carrot . in addition, intergenic sequence analysis provides evidence of a rare transfer of dna into the plastid genome. this is the first report of mitochondrial genome transfer into an angiosperm plastid genome. the strategy used in this study has broad application to explore more mitochondrial genomes, to further investigate intra-cellular genome interaction and genome evolution.

RESULTS
assembly
five different sets of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <dig> shotgun reads  with an average reads length ranging  <dig> to  <dig> nt, corresponding to an estimated nuclear genome coverage of  <dig> ×/set were used for initial assembly and  <dig>  3 kb paired-end reads were used for connection verification. in addition,  <dig> , <dig> illumina reads of length  <dig> nt were used to correct homopolymer ambiguity. each sequences set was independently assembled, each producing from  <dig>  to  <dig>  contigs . plastid assemblies resulted in five master circles with length ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nt . these five assemblies were then aligned with kalign  <cit> , generating a consensus sequence of  <dig>  nt . alignment of the de novo assembly with the published carrot plastid genome  <cit>  showed full-length coverage, with 99% identity relative to the published sequence including  <dig> nt of difference in cumulative sequence snps, and  <dig> nt of cumulative indels, with a maximum indel length of  <dig> nt.

mitochondrial assemblies were based on contig connections. in order to visualize these contig connections we developed and used bb.454contignet . the tool allows visualization of connections between gsassembler contigs, along with contig size and average read coverage. this visualization allowed us to establish single and repeat contigs.

with  <dig> single copy and  <dig> repeated contigs from sequence set  <dig> the mitochondrial genome could be arranged in two possible master circles of  <dig>  nt . sequence analysis identified four large repeat regions, five single copy regions, and  <dig> possible connections between repeat sequences and flanking regions in the master circles. sequence sets  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had some small gaps in their assemblies, due to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> missing connections, respectively . locations of these gaps were never shared between assemblies. alignment of the five assemblies gave a complete consensus sequence of  <dig>  nt . in order to confirm the  <dig> possible connections between repeat to repeat and repeat to single copy regions, we performed pcr and sequenced all possible amplicons spanning those regions. sequence of these amplicons confirmed all  <dig> expected connections . as a second verification, we mapped a set of  <dig>  3 kb whole genome paired-end reads onto the mitochondrial assembly, with both ends ≥ <dig> nt aligned. mapped reads with ≥95% similarity and ≥85% of the length matching the assembled sequence, and reads that aligned at least once within a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  nt of each other, were considered in agreement with the master circle assembly and  <dig>  reads mapped at least once within this range covering the entire assembled genome . by contrast, reads appearing to be in disagreement  were alternative mappings near repeat region borders  or with regions with plastid similarity that are within the expected range in the plastid genome and outside of the range in the mitochondrial genome . these results confirmed repeat connections as well as contig connections.

in the case of sequences of ambiguous source, common to both mitochondrial and plastid genomes, we determined the true mitochondrial-version of these common sequences. we amplified and sequenced three regions with size of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt using the sanger method. pcr results confirmed the size of the expected amplicons and these sequences were then incorporated into the mitochondrial assembly.

corrections and error rate
as  <dig> pyrosequencing is known to include insertion/deletion errors due to homopolymeric repeats  <cit> , we corrected homopolymer regions of ≥ 5nt by mapping  <dig> million illumina reads  with quality ≥ <dig>  excluding the three regions common to plastid and mitochondrion, independently sequenced by the sanger method . in total  <dig>  homopolymer sequences were detected,  <dig> in coding and  <dig>  in non-coding regions . after mapping,  <dig> errors were corrected,  <dig> in coding and  <dig> in non-coding regions, for a total length of  <dig> nt and an error rate of  <dig> %.

error rate estimation is for homopolymer sequences in coding and non-coding regions.

b calculated as cumulative ambiguity length/cumulative error length.

in addition to homopolymers, we also looked for ambiguity due to snps or single base insertions/deletions. overall, no ambiguities were detected resulting in a final assembly of  <dig>  nt.

coverage
assemblies of mitochondrial and plastid genomes in this study were carried out using  <dig> sequence data from whole genome libraries . in order to evaluate plastid and mitochondrial genome coverage obtained from all sets of shotgun  <dig> and illumina reads used in this study, we mapped sequences against the assembled plastid and mitochondrial genomes using gnumap  <cit> .

mapping of five sets of  <dig> shotgun reads  gave a coverage ranging from 123× to 173× for plastid, and from 16× and 23× for mitochondrial genomes . overall,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads mapped in the plastid and mitochondrial genome suggesting that about  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequenced dna was of plastid and mitochondrial origin, respectively.

for illumina sequences, out of  <dig> million reads ,  <dig> , <dig> sequences were successfully mapped to the plastid genome and  <dig> , <dig> sequences were mapped to the mitochondria giving a  <dig> x and 452x coverage, respectively . this suggests that about  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the sequenced dna was of plastid and mitochondrial origin, respectively.

analysis of gc content across the genomes indicate that in regions where the gc content is high the illumina read coverage is reduced . by contrast, high gc content did not affect  <dig> read coverage .

these results confirmed that unenriched whole genome sequencing is a practical approach for de novo assembly of higher plant plastid and mitochondrial genomes.

southern blot analysis
to evaluate the consistency of the assembly and possible recombination across repeats, a southern blot experiment was carried out. total genomic dna was digested with two enzymes, xhoi and eam1105i and hybridized with probes designed within repeats 1– <dig> and  <dig>  consistent with the assembled genome sequence, an expected hybridization pattern for both xhoi and eam1105i was observed . in addition, the digestion pattern of repeat  <dig> with both xhoi and eam1105i was consistent with the expected size fragments  of the recombinant sub-circles  <dig> and  <dig> .

genome size and content
the  <dig>  nt mitochondrial genome presented in figure  <dig> is one of the two possible master circle conformations. after brassica napus  and silene latifolia , the carrot mitochondrial genome is one of the smallest mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date among the angiosperms. the overall gc content of carrot  is comparable to other angiosperms  <cit>  . considering alignments with minimum length of  <dig> nt, the portion of the genome exhibiting 80% or more similarity with nicotiana, vitis and carica constitutes  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. intergenic spacer regions represent the largest part of the genome with  <dig>  nt . coding-exons represent  <dig> %  of the genome, and rna-coding genes constitute  <dig> % , with rrna accounting for  <dig> %  and trna accounting for  <dig> %  of the genome .

a blast search against a local mitochondrial protein and nucleotide database identified  <dig> putatively functional protein-coding genes and  <dig> genes coding for ribosomal rnas . for all of these genes, open reading frames  were detected, confirming the quality of the consensus sequence. distribution of genes is illustrated in figure  <dig>  as in other angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, most of the known genes encode for proteins of the electron transport chain, with  <dig> subunits of complex i , one subunit of complex iii , three subunits of complex iv , five subunits of complex v  and four genes involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c . truncated copies of atp <dig> and atp <dig> were detected, confirming observations previously reported by  <cit> . in addition, two conserved orfs, coding for a maturase  mapped within the nad <dig> intron and another orf named mttb coding for a transporter protein, were detected.

the number of ribosomal and succinate dehydrogenase proteins is usually variable among different species . annotation of the carrot mitochondrial genome allowed identification of  <dig> putatively functional genes coding for ribosomal proteins  of mitochondrial origin and one, rpl <dig> of plastid origin. the genome appears to lack functional copies of the succinate dehydrogenase genes sdh <dig> and sdh <dig> 

because they are in repeat regions, one gene  is duplicated, and six genes occur in triplicate . detection of orfs allowed identification of  <dig> group ii introns,  <dig> of which are trans-spliced.

blast searches against a local nucleotide mitochondrial database and detection with trna scan-se allowed identification of genes coding for  <dig> trnas . one is a pseudogene, coding for a plastid-derived trna-ile  with a deletion in the coding sequence. out of the  <dig> trnas, four are of plastid origin and  <dig> of mitochondrial origin. these trna genes recognize  <dig> amino acids . thus, trna genes for six amino acids are missing in the carrot mitochondrial genome.

b bold indicates trna of mitochondrial origin;

c ψ: pseudogene;

d italic indicate trna of plastid origin.

in order to investigate the presence of the seven missing mitochondrial genes  in the nuclear genome we aligned the corresponding sequences from the mitochondrial genome of the species most closely related to carrot  against a local database containing all the assembled sequences and raw reads used in this study. for three genes, sdh <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig>  a corresponding contig with conserved orfs was detected in the nuclear genome . none or insignificant matches were identified for the remaining four genes, sdh <dig>  rpl <dig>  rps <dig> and rps <dig> suggesting that these genes were not present in this dataset.

intergenic sequences
after annotation of conserved genes, we searched for other orfs and plastid regions in the intergenic sequences and orfs longer than  <dig> nt were annotated . in total,  <dig> orfs ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt in length were detected . out of these,  <dig> orfs were conserved among mitochondrial genomes, with the best match of orf <dig> to orf <dig> of nicotiana tabacum, of orf <dig> to orf115b of brassica napus and of orf <dig> to orf <dig> of beta vulgaris. out of the remaining orfs,  <dig>  had unknown function, and  <dig>  were similar to truncated copies of hypothetical proteins from vitis vinifera and arabidopsis thaliana nuclear genes.

blast analysis of intergenic sequences against a local database containing all published plant plastid genomes allowed detection of  <dig> fragments with similarity to plastid sequences, with length ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt, accounting for  <dig>  nt  .

repeats
with a total of  <dig> repeats ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt, the carrot mitochondrial genome has the lowest number of repeats among the sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes . all but one are dispersed repeats. most of the repeats  are between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length accounting for just  <dig> % of the total genome coverage. nine large repeats ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  nt account for  <dig> % of the genome. analysis of repeat orientation allowed the detection of  <dig> direct repeats  and  <dig> inverted repeats . the insertion of the large repeat  <dig>  between repeat  <dig> and  <dig>  forms a 35 kb super-repeat. after wild cabbage  <cit> , this is the largest repeat region described in eudicot mitochondrial genomes to date.

evidence of dna transfer into the plastid genome
recently goremykin and colleagues  <cit> , while analyzing the vitis vinifera mitochondrial genome, detected two sequences of  <dig>  and  <dig> nt  which were similar to the carrot plastid genome . both sequences are contained in a  <dig>  nt carrot plastid sequence  that is absent in other published plastid genomes. blast analysis revealed that the  <dig> nt sequence is similar to cox <dig> gene, suggesting a transfer of dna from the mitochondrial to the plastid genome. given this unexpected finding and no experimental confirmation, the authors concluded that an evaluation of this region of the carrot plastid assembly would be needed. in order to refer to this sequence we coded it as daucus carota mitochondrial plastid sequence .

here we confirm the presence of this region in the carrot plastid genome in the inbred carrot line b493b analyzed in this study . in addition, analysis of intergenic sequences of the carrot mitochondrial genome revealed that this entire sequence is present in the mitochondrial genome as three separate pieces. comparison of d. carota to petroselium crispum  revealed that the carrot plastid genome lacks a  <dig> nt sequence  present in the p. crispum and other more taxonomically distant species because of the replacement with the dcmp region.

in order to clarify the origin of this region, we first designed primers specific of flanking regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the plastid genome or region  <dig> of the mitochondrial genome. we then amplified and sequenced these regions in different apiaceae species. pcr results revealed a consistent conservation of the region  <dig> in the mitochondrial genomes; in fact an expected amplicon of  <dig>  nt was amplified across all species . by contrast, a polymorphic pattern has been obtained when the plastid flanking sequences were used to anchor the primers . a short fragment of  <dig> nt was amplified in all non daucus species including parsley , fennel , celery , plains eryngo  and  <dig> nt in coriander . the only exception was for cumin  which has the same pattern as carrot. with the exception of d. aureus, d. crinitus and d. muricatus, where amplicons of about  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt were obtained, respectively, other daucus species and cumin produced the amplicon of expected size,  <dig>  nt.

sanger sequence of above described pcr products confirmed the presence of the large region  <dig> in the mitochondrial genome of all daucus and non daucus species. it also confirmed, the absence of the insertion of regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the plastid genome of non daucus species . these sequences and its taxonomic distribution in daucus and close relative cumin  provide strong evidence of a transfer of dna into the plastome. in addition a few variants were observed. an insertion observed in the plastid dcmp region of wild species d. aureus, d. crinitus and d. glochidiatus is similar to a mitochondrial sequence contiguous to the dcmp region  <dig> . this suggests that this region now identified as region  <dig> was part of the original insertion in the plastid genome of the ancestral progenitor of carrot. sequence analyses of the plastid d. murucatus dcmp region revealed that the shorter amplicon is due to a deletion of regions  <dig> and  <dig> 

to investigate the sequence characteristics that might provide a possible explanation of this transfer in the carrot plastid genome, we aligned the plastid and mitochondrial sequences of regions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> against ncbi nucleotide and protein databases. the alignment demonstrated that region  <dig> was an intergenic sequence with no similarity to any other nucleotide or protein sequence present in databases. as previously reported by goremykin and colleagues  <cit> , region  <dig> is part of the cox <dig> gene. it is more interesting that blastx alignment of region  <dig> revealed multiple matches with nuclear retrotransposable elements from different species including vitis vinifera  and populus trichocarpa  .

discussion
implications for mitochondrial genome study
next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized molecular biology by making whole genome sequencing projects possible for any species. low coverage whole genome shotgun sequencing has proven a valuable approach for rapid and easy acquisition of a large amount of sequence data at relatively low cost. low coverage data is useful for marker acquisition as well as the assembly of plastid genomes  <cit> . despite its power, few examples of the application of ngs on de novo assembly of plant mitochondrial genomes have been reported. recently straub and colleagues  <cit>  attempted to assemble the milkweed mitochondrial genome using illumina data from unenriched whole genome dna. the assembly resulted in a partial mitochondrial genome assembly of  <dig> contigs. here we demonstrate how  <dig> data from whole genome dna library can be used for a complete de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome of daucus carota. adequate coverage, sufficient read length, and application of a bioinformatics analysis using a tool such as bb.454contignet were crucial for the final assembly.

our sequencing library was prepared from whole genome dna. the fraction of reads of plastid and mitochondrial genome origin obtained from such a library can vary depending on the age of tissue, dna extraction method, relative size of the organelle and nuclear genomes, and species  <cit> . adequate coverage is always necessary for a complete plastid and mitochondrial genome assembly, but this coverage likely can be obtained, even with a low nuclear genome coverage. the fact that we were near the lower limit can be seen from a comparison of the five assembly replicates, which suggests that if the coverage is too low, the complete assembly of the mitochondrial genome can begin to fail apparently due to isolated gaps in the sequence due to random chance.

in our study, leaf tissue was collected from plants without any pretreatment  that could reduce the amount of plastid or mitochondrial dna. the same dna extraction was sequenced by both platforms. we observed approximately twice the organellar fraction from illumina sequencing, relative to  <dig>  the interpretation of this observation is difficult as many factors could be involved. here we observed that illumina is more sensitive to regions with variable gc content than is  <dig>  in a range of gc content of 20–50% other authors reported a positive correlation between gc contents and sequence coverage  <cit> . since organellar dna is typically higher in gc content than nuclear dna, we suggest this as one of possible cause of the higher representation of organellar fraction from illumina sequencing.

development of new bioinformatic tools is often a crucial point for interpreting dna/rna sequence information into biological information  <cit> . repeat regions are the primary difficulty in genome assembly, and the length of reads relative to the length of repeats is a key factor in the ability to assemble a genome  <cit> . reads from repeats longer than the read length could assemble to multiple possible sequences, some of which may not exist in vivo. these cannot be collapsed into a single unambiguous sequence, thereby causing breaks in contigs, where one end of a contig can then lead to two or more adjacent contigs which continue the sequence. some assemblers such as gsassembler make this connection information available. we developed and used bb.454contignet http://www.vcru.wisc.edu/simonlab/sdata/software/ to parse, filter, and then graphically visualize these contig connections. this tool was very useful for our small-scale assembly project, and it could be suitable for other applications, such as assembly of bacterial artificial chromosome sequences, or specific regions in a whole genome assembly. as confirmation of the validity of our procedure, another group has successfully assembled another genome using this tool  <cit> . a similar tool, abyss-explorer has been developed for assemblies generated by abyss  <cit> . however, our results demonstrate the utility of shotgun  <dig> sequences with a size of 300– <dig> nt, making the experiment cost efficient, and we confirmed the assembly by pcr, southern blot and mapping 3 kb paired end data.

full de novo assembly of the mitochondrial genome can be very difficult due to repeat regions as well as its dynamic organization due to frequent recombination events. recent advances in illumina and roche  <dig> sequencing technologies have allowed increasing read length up to  <dig> and  <dig> nt, respectively . in addition, both ngs technologies officially support paired sequence data of up to 5 kb for illumina platform and up 20 kb for roche  <dig> platform. comparison of the distribution of the number and the length of the repeat sequences among sequenced mitochondrial genomes and the whole range of longest sequencing data achievable by both technologies demonstrates the power of ngs to overcome most of the assembly ambiguities due to repeats across these genomes. moreover, use of long shotgun sequences alone, such as  <dig> reads, would resolve assembly ambiguity across a large portion of repeat regions detected among these mitochondrial genomes . by contrast, use of short shotgun reads such as illumina could still result in a high number of contigs and connections that could make the assembly unreliable. paired sequence data can support and confirm assembly, and supply information about structural variants due to recombination across repeats. the ongoing development of third generation sequencing technologies such as pacbio , able to produce longer reads, will facilitate sequencing of new organelle genomes.

the usefulness of new organelle genome sequences will be reduced if their quality is reduced by sequence errors. next generation sequencing technology is known to generate a sequence error rate higher than the traditional sanger method  <cit> . most of these errors can be corrected with high sequence coverage. however, errors due to inaccurate determination of homopolymer length, particularly when ≥ <dig> nt, are characteristic of pyrosequencing , and are not resolvable by higher coverage. these errors can result in an inaccurate sequence annotation if the error occurs in a reading frame. in our study, homopolymer ambiguity was detected in both coding and non coding sequences. availability of illumina sequences allowed us to correct these homopolymer errors as described above. after corrections, orf detection confirmed contiguous reading frames of all of the genes predicted by blast alignment, an additional verification of the correctness of the finished sequences. combining these two technologies for this type of correction has already been described  <cit> . the high number  of homopolymer regions observed in this study would make verification of every homopolymer region by sanger sequencing uneconomical. by contrast, the low number of ambiguities in coding regions  <cit>  in such a small scale sequencing project would allow the use of a sanger sequencing approach as an alternative cost-efficient way to correct ambiguity in those regions, and insure correct annotation of genes.

genome organization
carrot is the first mitochondrial genome sequenced among the large euasterid ii clade, and only the second, along with n. tabacum, among asterids. the size of the genome  is similar to a previous estimation  made by robinson and wolyn  <cit>  based on restriction digestion mapping. sequence analysis revealed that the closest mitochondrial genome in terms of similarity was tobacco, confirming their phylogenetic relationship in the euasterid ii clade. the gene content of the carrot mitochondrial genome confirms the previous report of adams et al.  <cit>  where the authors used southern hybridization to survey mitochondrial gene presence or loss across  <dig> angiosperms. the major factor accounting for gene loss in the mitochondrial genomes is transfer to the nuclear genome. presence or absence of mitochondrial genes in the nuclear genome have been reported for several species  <cit> , including the transfer of rps <dig> <cit>  and a lack of sdh <dig> and sdh <dig> <cit>  in the nuclear genome of carrot. in contrast with these data, our results revealed the presence of a nuclear copy of sdh <dig> in the carrot genome. in addition, we confirmed the transfer of rps <dig> from the mitochondria into the nucleus and detected an additional nuclear copy of rps <dig>  we also found a replacement of the original mitochondrial rpl <dig> with a copy of the plastid rpl <dig> in the mitochondria. the high level of similarity between the rpl <dig> nucleotide sequences in these two organellar genomes  suggests a recent translocation. the lack of any sequence similar to the mitochondrial rpl <dig> gene in the nuclear genome suggests that the original mitochondrial version has been lost. according to kubo and arimura  <cit> , the replacement of a mitochondrial gene by a duplicated plastid counterpart could be due to the complete loss of the gene in either mitochondrial or nuclear genomes. however, detection of the orfs for nuclear sdh3rps10rps <dig> and plastid rpl <dig> suggests the possibility of functionality. further work will be needed to determine whether these nuclear copies are expressed.

the structure of angiosperm mitochondrial genomes is frequently characterized by repeat sequences  <cit> . the number and the size of these repeats is important, as they influence the size of the genome, and they are the sites of intragenomic recombination, underlining evolutionary changes in mitochondrial genome organization and structural dynamism in vivo <cit> . a high proportion of smaller repeat sequences explained  the size of the largest mitochondrial genome of cucumis melo <cit> . in contrast, in maize  <cit> , variable genome size among different genotypes is mainly caused by large  sequence duplication. the structure of the carrot mitochondrial genome presented here revealed that nearly half  of the genome is composed of large repeated sequences. the fact that carrot has the least number of repeat sequences among sequenced mitochondrial genomes and the presence of four large repeats , we deduced that the increase of the carrot mitochondrial genome size mainly occurred by large sequence duplication.

intragenomic recombination is an active phenomenon in the mitochondrial genome of angiosperms  <cit> . recombination frequency seems to depend on the size of the repeats. large size direct repeats  are associated with high frequency of homologous recombination producing sub genomic molecules observed in other mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . our southern blot results provide evidence of recombination across a large repeat  <dig> , and the in vivo co-existence of sub-genomic circles. smaller repeats, however, suggest very low recombination frequency, producing aberrant asymmetric recombinant molecules that are generally present at very low copy number and hard to detect  <cit> . in this study, we tested a possible recombination across short repeats using next generation sequencing data from roche  <dig> and illumina platforms and our results did not support any recombination events . it was shown recently that mitochondrial intergenomic recombination required stretches of similarity longer than  <dig> nt and remained under control of a nuclear gene msh <dig>  inactivation of msh <dig> lead to increased frequency of recombination and allowed recombination between repeats only  <dig> nt-long  <cit> .

dna insertion in the plastid genome
intercompartmental  dna migration is a known phenomenon in plant cell evolution. dna transfer among these compartments resulted in a functional relocation of organellar genes in the early phase of organelle evolution  <cit> . theoretically, six intercompartmental dna migrations are possible, and at least four have been observed in angiosperms . transfers of dna from mitochondrion to nucleus and from plastid to mitochondrion are discussed above . dna migration from plastid to nucleus has been described in arabidopsis, soybean and other species  <cit> . nuclear dna has been transferred to the mitochondrial genome of cucumis melo <cit>  and other species  <cit> . in contrast, no evidence of transfer of dna from nucleus or mitochondria to plastid has been reported in angiosperms  <cit> . smith  <cit>  investigated the presence of mitochondrial dna in the plastid genome of  <dig> species including  <dig> angiosperm, and found a complete absence of mtdna like sequences in any of the plastid genome of these species. recently goremykin and colleagues  <cit>  reported a fragment of mitochondrial dna in vitis with similarity to a sequence of  <dig> nt present only in the carrot plastid genome.

in this study, we confirmed the presence of this sequence in the plastid genome of carrot, and discovered that it was also present as three non-contiguous sequences in the mitochondrial genome. pcr results and sequence analysis clearly document conservation of a large portion of this sequence  across all mitochondrial genomes of the diverse apiaceae species examined, and a “gain pattern” only in daucus and cuminum plastid genomes. this evidence strongly suggests a transfer of dna into the plastid genome. in addition, the observation of the insertion of the dcmp region  <dig> in the plastid genome of wild daucus species d. aureusd. crinitus and d. glochidiatus led us to hypothesize that in the ancestor of carrot the dcmp regions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were contiguous when the transfer event occurred. assuming a single transfer event, the loss of the sequence contiguity in the mitochondrial genome could be due to a recombination of that genome, as is often observed in plant mitochondrial genomes. according to downie et al.  <cit> , cuminum is the closest relative to carrot of the taxa examined here. the pcr patterns obtained across species for the plastid copy of dcmp concur with that classification and suggest that the presence of the dcmp region can be a distinctive feature of species from the daucus clade.

the fact that the dcmp <dig> sequence has no matches in sequence data bases makes interpretation of its origin difficult. limited similarity with a retrotransposon element  of vitis vinifera and other species suggests that a retrotransposable element might have been moved from the nuclear genome into the mitochondrial and then into the plastid genome, or directly and independently from the nuclear genome to plastid and mitochondrial genomes. the fragment of  <dig> nt at the 5′ end of dcmp <dig> is very conserved across several even more diverse angiosperm mitochondrial genomes, which suggests a mitochondrial origin, and also suggests that the transfer occurred from mitochondrial to plastid genome. however, considering the exceptional dna up take system of plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , other sources of dna donors via horizontal transfer or transfer from the nuclear genome cannot be excluded. rare insertions of retrotransposon elements into the plastid genome have been observed in the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit> , but based on our knowledge this is the first evidence of transfer of dna from mitochondrial genome to plastid genome, and the potential presence of a possible retrotransposon in the plastid genome of a flowering plant.

CONCLUSIONS
our results confirmed that unenriched whole genome sequencing is a practical approach for de novo assembly of higher plant mitochondrial genomes. sequence analysis confirmed the dynamic organization of the mitochondrial genomes in carrot as in other mitochondrial genomes. this first report of a dna insertion from the mitochondria in the angiosperm plastid genome suggests that new and unknown mechanisms in intercompartimental genome interactions may exist. the new approach developed here for assembly of the mitochondrial genome used here could be used more broadly to sequence and assemble mitochondrial genomes of diverse plant species. this would supplement the currently limited number of sequenced mitochondrial genomes, and may allow us to better understand intra- and inter-genomic dna transfers and recombination, and this new instance of transfer of dna to plastid genomes could possibly have occurred in other angiosperms.
