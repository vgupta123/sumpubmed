BACKGROUND
the ripening of fleshy fruits causes complex biochemical changes during the transformation from the developmental program to the ripening process, which is regulated by hundreds to thousands of genes . ethylene is essential for the initiation and completion of tomato  fruit ripening  <cit> . aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase  and acc oxidase  are responsible for ethylene biosynthesis, which catalyze the conversion of s-adenosyl-methionine to acc and acc to ethylene, respectively  <cit> . there are many innate elicitors that can induce ethylene production in plants, including abscisic acid , which can phosphorylate the c-terminus of atacs <dig> by activating arabidopsis thaliana’s calcium-dependent protein kinases atcdpk <dig> and atcdpk <dig>  <cit> , and auxin, which can inhibit aba-induced stomatal closure by promoting ethylene production  <cit> . additionally, the cell wall degradation products released during the regular fruit ripening process can also induce ethylene production, playing an important role in the complex process of fruit ripening  <cit> .

oligogalacturonic acids  are oligomers of alpha- <dig> -linked galacturonosyl residues released from the cell wall by the hydrolysis of polygalacturonic acids  <cit>  upon microbial infection  <cit>  and mechanical damage  <cit> , as well as during fruit ripening  <cit> . as a plant innate elicitor, ogs can induce a series of plant responses  <cit> , including ethylene synthesis  <cit> , the inhibition of auxin action  <cit> , the accumulation of phytoalexins  <cit>  and callose, and the production of reactive oxygen species  <cit>  and nitric oxide  <cit> . previous studies demonstrated the endogenous accumulation of pectin-derived oligosaccharides, including ogs, in tomato tissues that were just beginning to ripen and these promoted a short increase of ethylene production in mg tomato pericarp discs  <cit> . also, the pectin breakdown products of tomato fruits can be induced by pathogen-related enzyme action  <cit> . these studies indicate that endogenous pectin-derived oligosaccharides exist and function in the normal course of ripening and disease defense in tomatoes. early studies suggested that ogs could promote ethylene biosynthesis in tomato fruits or discs, and in pear cell suspensions  <cit> . a mixture of small-sized ogs elicited ethylene production in tomato plants as a response to wounding  <cit> . ogs with four to six degrees of polymerization  were shown to be more effective in ethylene promotion through their ability to induce the expression of the leaco <dig> gene  <cit> . although the ogs’ ability to enhance ethylene production has been shown, the mechanisms behind this capability have not been elaborated and whether the ogs impact the fruit ripening progress remains unclear.

recent studies found that ogs could mediate cell wall signal transduction and are recognized by wall-associated kinases and kinase-like proteins , which contain an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic kinase domain  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atwak <dig> interacts with cell wall pectins in a calcium-induced conformation and is an ogs receptor  <cit> , ogs can affect many plant developmental and stress responses by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinases  in a wak2-dependent manner  <cit> . activated mapks can regulate a series of phytohormones, including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene, which extensively modulate plant growth, development, and stress/defense responses  <cit> . several acs proteins can be regulated by mapks through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation  <cit> . the phosphorylation of atacs <dig> and atacs <dig> by mapk <dig> led to the accumulation of the acs protein and elevated levels of cellular acs activity, promoting ethylene production  <cit> . calcium-dependent protein kinases  are also implicated in acs regulation  <cit> . in tomato, phosphorylation by mapk and cdpk are both required to promote leacs <dig> stability in the wounded tomato pericarp, and the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of leacs <dig> regulates its turnover upstream of the ubiquitin-26s-proteasome degradation pathway  <cit> .

in this study, we found that ogs could promote the ripening of the tomato cultivar ‘ailsa craig’  fruits at the mature green  <dig>  stage by inducing ethylene biosynthesis. additionally, the transcriptional levels of leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> were up-regulated in the presence of ogs. ogs also induce the phosphorylation of leacs <dig> at ser- <dig>  these results demonstrated that ogs induced ethylene biosynthesis at transcriptional and post-translational levels, and then promoted the ripening of tomato fruits. in addition, as a candidate ogs receptor, lewakl <dig> was affected by ogs, which remains to be studied further.

methods
ogs preparation and separation for different dp
ogs mixture with different degrees of polymerization were prepared from polygalacturonic acid  according to previous studies  <cit>  with adjustment. 1 g pga was dissolved in 100 ml  <dig>  m ph  <dig>  sodium acetate, pga was first incubated with 100 μl pectin methylesterase  at 37 °c for 2 h with shaking to remove the methyl residues, the solution was heated to 100 °c for 5 min to inactivation the pme,  <dig> u polygalacturonase  was then added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °c, finally incubated at 100 °c for 10 min.

we used anion exchange chromatography on a qae-sephadex a- <dig> matrix  to separate ogs with different dp, after equilibrated with  <dig>  m imidazole hcl buffer ph  <dig>  for 200 ml  <cit> , ph  <dig>  imidazole hcl of  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m,  <dig>  m were used to elute the ogs with 500 ml for each concentration. 9 ml elution was collected for each pool, thin-layer chromatography  and total uronic acids content was detected with m-phenyl phenol method  <cit>  , pools with same dp were combined and desalted with sephadex g- <dig> matrix . separation results were further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrum  as shown in additional file  <dig> according to simpson et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
og-induced tomato fruit ripening is developmentally regulated
wild-type ac tomato fruits were treated at mg  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> stages with ogs prepared as previously reported  <cit> . ethylene production was detected every day after treatment, and fruits were photographed. only mg <dig> fruits showed an accelerated ripening process, and the differences were found in two aspects of mg  <dig> fruits. ethylene synthesis was accelerated to 3 nl · g−1fw · h− <dig> by 2 days after treatment, approximately 3 days earlier than the control group . furthermore, the maximum rate of ethylene biosynthesis was enhanced. ethylene accumulated to ~8 nl · g−1fw · h− <dig> by 4 days after treatment and stayed at this high value until 6 days, when it started to slowly and steadily decrease. in the control fruits, a relatively lower ethylene synthesis rate was detected until 8 days after treatment. the rates were similar in both groups after 8 days. the og-treated fruit’s ethylene synthesis rates were not significantly different than those treated with control solution at other stages .fig.  <dig> ethylene production of ac mg <dig> fruits treated with or without ogs. tomato fruits were placed in a ventilated and temperature constant room at 25 °c and treated with 1 g/l ogs or the control solution. each fruit was put in a 300 ml air tight container at 25 °c for 1 h and 1 ml gas was extracted to detect ethylene content. vertical bars indicate the sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with the control group . the red arrow indicates the ethylene production of 3 nl · g−1fw · h− <dig> which corresponds to the breaker stage of tomato fruit on the plant



accompanying the ethylene production, og-treated ac mg  <dig> stage fruits showed an accelerated color change that occurred approximately 2 days earlier than the color change in the control group . no alterations in the timing of the color changes were found on og-treated mg  <dig> or mg  <dig> stage fruits . the emerging pattern of redness in og-treated fruits was found linearly on the fruits’ surfaces, not from the top of the fruit as in controls . we further found that the red areas on the fruits’ surfaces corresponded to the septum where ogs mainly accumulated when they were applied to fruit using vacuum infiltration through the joint between fruit and carpopodium.fig.  <dig> color changes of ac fruits treated with or without ogs. a mg  <dig>  mg  <dig> and mg  <dig> stage ac fruits were treated with 1 g/l ogs or the control solution through vacuum infiltration. photos taken  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 7 days after conduction. b detail color changes of mg  <dig> stage fruits,  <dig> or 5 days after treatment with ogs or the control solution respectively, red arrow indicates the position that had first turned red



the data demonstrated that ogs could induce tomato fruit’s ethylene production and promoted the mg <dig> fruit ripening process. the results using different fruit stages suggested that the tomato fruit’s response to the ogs’ induced ripening was developmentally regulated.

ethylene perception and signaling pathways are necessary for og-promoted fruit ripening
to identify whether the ethylene perception and/or signaling pathways participated in ogs’ promotion of fruit ripening, tomato fruit mutants neverripe , ripening inhibitor , non-ripening , and colorless non-ripening  were treated with ogs or the control solution. the mg nr fruits had continuously increasing ethylene production levels after treatment, but no obvious differences were found between the treatment and control groups . as nr is an ethylene receptor mutant, resulting in the inhibition of ethylene perception  <cit> , this result indicated that the ripening process stimulated by the ogs relied on ethylene perception.fig.  <dig> ethylene production of nr fruits treated with or without ogs. each fruit was put in a 300 ml air tight container at 25 °c for 1 h. 1 ml gas was extracted to detect ethylene content. vertical bars indicate the sd 



the rin, nor, and cnr mutants all had drastically reduced ethylene production levels and the ripening process could not be restored by an exposure to exogenous ethylene, indicating a functional defect in ethylene signaling  <cit> . we treated these mutants with ogs to test whether the ethylene signaling pathway was necessary for og-induced ethylene production as well as fruit ripening. no obvious differences were found among the rin, nor, and cnr fruit ripening processes with or without ogs treatments , indicating that the ethylene signal transduction pathway was necessary for og-induced tomato fruit ripening.

in our experiments on the og-promoted tomato fruit ripening, the ethylene production was measured starting 1 day after ogs treatment. campbell et al. found that ethylene production in pectic oligomers treated tomato fruit discs showed a transient increase  <cit> . therefore, to further examine whether a short-term boost in ethylene production existed in og-treated tomato-ripening mutant fruits, we measured the ethylene production of nr, rin, nor, and cnr fruit discs after ogs treatment. a transient ethylene production was observed in all of the mutant fruits after ogs treatment . these results indicated that og-induced transient ethylene production is not blocked by the lack of transcription factors rin, nor, cnr or ethylene receptor nr.

og-regulated expression patterns of ethylene synthesis-related genes
to explore whether ogs affect ethylene synthesis-related gene expression levels, we measured the long term expression levels of leacs1a, leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  and leaco <dig> after ogs treatment . leacs <dig>  leacs <dig>  and leaco <dig> were up-regulated by 12 h after treatment with ogs, but no significant differences were found after the second day. leacs1a and leacs <dig> were not obviously changed by the ogs and both groups stayed at low levels. because of the effects of ogs on ethylene production and the distinct changes in the transcriptional levels of related genes within the first day, obtaining more detailed ethylene production and gene expression profiles during the first 24 h was necessary.fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of ethylene synthesis-related genes. leacs1a , leacs2 , leacs4 , leacs6  and leaco1  gene expression values were presented relative to the actin. vertical bars indicate the sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with the control group 



we first measured the ethylene production of ac fruits during the 24 h after treatment with ogs or the control solution. as shown in fig.  <dig>  ogs treatment induced a significant burst of ethylene production compared with control fruits by 5 h, 8 h and 12 h. for the gene expression levels, leacs <dig> was induced by ogs 1 h after treatment, although this enhancement was only sustained for 2 h. then, it increased again from the 8 h, having a ~ <dig> fold increase over the control group at 12 h after treatment . a similar expression pattern was found for leaco <dig> , although the change was not as significant as that of leacs <dig>  leacs <dig> was also induced by ogs 1 h after treatment, however this effect was transient and not as strong as leacs <dig> . no obvious differences were found between the treatment groups for leacs1a and leacs <dig>  and they all decreased rapidly from 1 h after treatment . combined the results of ethylene production and ethylene synthesis-related genes expression indicated that leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> are the two related genes involved in transcriptional regulation of ogs induced transient ethylene production.fig.  <dig> transient ethylene production of ac mg <dig> fruits with or without ogs treatment. vertical bars indicate the sd . asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with the control group

og-induced ethylene synthesis is phosphorylation regulated and leacs <dig> is phosphorylated after ogs treatment
leacs <dig> turnover was adjusted by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and occupied an important position in ethylene synthesis. phosphorylated leacs <dig> at ser- <dig> proved to be more stable and boosted ethylene synthesis  <cit> . to identify whether phosphorylation/dephosphorylation process involved in ogs induced ethylene production, fruits were treated with protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitors 1 h before treatment with ogs. ethylene production was detected after treatment as shown in fig.  <dig>  the protein kinase inhibitor k252a apparently inhibited the ogs’ promotion of ethylene synthesis by 5 h after treatment. in contrast, the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid  enhanced the ethylene production induced by the ogs and the differences were significant by 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after treatment compared with ogs treatment alone. this suggested that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation affected the ethylene synthesis induced by the ogs.fig.  <dig> protein kinase/phosphatase inhibitors regulate ogs’ effect on ethylene synthesis. ac mg <dig> fruits were treated with 10 μm k252a in  <dig>  % dmso, 1 μm oa in  <dig>  % dmso or  <dig>  % dmso, respectively, 1 h before treatment with ogs. vertical bars indicate the sd . significant differences of four groups at each time point were indicated by different letters 



additionally, we selected leacs <dig> as a target to detect the phosphorylation level using a western blot analysis with anti-phosphorylated leacs <dig> at ser- <dig> after ogs treatment. ogs induced the accumulation of phosphorylated leacs <dig> from 1 h, with its highest value occurring at 5 h, and little phosphorylated leacs <dig> was found later . protein kinase inhibitor k252a reduced leacs <dig> gradually after treatment, although the value detected was higher at the first hour compared with samples treated with ogs alone. phosphorylated leacs <dig> was also accumulated at 1 h when pretreated with oa, but this effect rapidly decreased and did not return until 12 h, showing the long-term effects of oa on ogs treatment.fig.  <dig> time-course analysis of phosphorylated leacs <dig> treated with or without ogs. proteins were extracted from samples the same for gene expression detection. total 25 μg protein were loaded on each line to separate through 8 % sds-page gel, anti-phosphorylated-leacs <dig> was incubated with membrane overnight at 4 °c. ponceaux dyeing was used to verify the protein amount. the relative intensities of phosphorylated-leacs <dig> were quantified with adobe photoshop cc. we used the second hour protein band intensity of the control group as standard. the experiment was repeated in triplicate. a representative gel is shown. significant differences of four groups at each time point were indicated by different letters 



lewakl <dig> was induced by ogs as a candidate receptor
the waks/wakls family members were considered candidate receptors of the ogs as shown in a. thaliana and were involved in signal transduction after ogs treatment  <cit> . here, we found that lewakl <dig> was induced by ogs to a level approximately three-fold greater than that in the control fruits by 2 h after treatment . we also performed a western blot analysis with anti-lewakl <dig>  to detect the protein level after treatment. lewakl <dig> continued to accumulate after treatment, reaching its highest value at 8 h, and no lewakl <dig> signal was detected in fruits treated with the control solution .fig.  <dig> gene expression and protein variation of lewakl <dig>  a gene expression levels of lewakl <dig> by 2 h after ogs treatment, and the values were presented relative to the actin. the experiment was repeated in triplicate, and the asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared with the control group . b protein accumulation of lewakl <dig>  total 25 μg protein were loaded on each line to separate through 8 % sds-page gel, and anti-lewakl <dig> was incubated with membrane overnight at 4 °c. the relative intensities of lewakl <dig> were quantified with adobe photoshop cc for ogs treated group. we used the first hour lewakl <dig> protein band intensity as standard since no signals were detected for the control group. ponceaux dyeing was used to verify the protein amount. the experiment was repeated in triplicate. a representative gel is shown. significant differences of four groups at each time point were indicated by different letters 



discussion
ogs, as plant elicitors, can regulate ethylene, auxin and other phytohormones in plant development and innate defenses . our experiments confirmed that exogenous ogs could induce ethylene production in the short and long term, and accelerated fruit ripening, which were consistent with a previous study using fruit pericarp discs  <cit> . here we showed that this acceleration of fruit ripening was developmentally regulated and that mg  <dig> stage fruits showed obvious phenotypes . we speculated that the transient ethylene production played critical roles in the acceleration of tomato fruit ripening and the effects of ogs on mg2/ <dig> fruits might be masked as the fruit matured and produced more ethylene. cutillas-iturralde et al have shown that ethylene was induced by exogenous application of xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides in persimmon  and the later harvested fruits showed more evident ethylene production after treatment  <cit> . although persimmon fruits synthesized lower ethylene compared with tomato fruits, this phenomenon strengthened our idea that oligosaccharides’ function on fruit ethylene synthesis correlated with fruit development stage.

the system- <dig> ethylene synthesis was initiated at the onset of climacteric fruit ripening, and autocatalytic ethylene synthesis has a pivotal role in the system- <dig> ethylene synthesis, as well as the ripening process  <cit> . whether the ogs induced acceleration of fruit ripening required ethylene signal transduction was not clear. in our experiments, we found that fruit pericarp discs of ac, nr, rin, nor, and cnr all showed obvious short term ethylene bursts after being treated with ogs . we considered that the og-induced transient ethylene production was similar to the ethylene production initiated by wounding, which can be elicited rapidly  <cit> . however, our data indicated that long term ethylene synthesis and the ripening process of mutant fruits with defective climacteric respiration in ethylene biosynthesis were all not affected by ogs . therefore, we speculated that ogs’ functions in fruit ripening required system- <dig> ethylene synthesis and the autocatalytic regulation by the ethylene signaling pathway. additionally, previous studies found that exogenous aba could accelerate the ripening process of mg tomato fruits and this appears to require ethylene production because 1-mcp could fully block aba’s effect on fruit ripening and softening  <cit> . thus, autocatalytic ethylene synthesis is required for both og- and aba-triggered fruit ripening.

the transcriptional and post-translational regulation of ethylene synthesis proved pivotal for plant development and ripening . previous studies demonstrated that wound- and aba-induced ethylene synthesis mostly depended on post-transcriptional regulation . however, we found that the regulation of ogs on ethylene production was at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. at the transcriptional level, leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> were induced twice after ogs treatment , which was consistent with previous researches in which atacs <dig>  ataco, aterf <dig>  and aterf <dig> were all induced by ogs treated a. thaliana cell suspensions  <cit> . further, we found that phospho-leacs <dig> was accumulated after the treatment, with its highest value occurring after 5 h. k252a decreased protein accumulation and oa enhanced protein accumulation, especially after the 12 h . although k252a and oa are not specific protein kinase inhibitors, previous studies demonstrated that k252a can block the phosphorylation of leacs <dig> by mapk and cdpk  <cit> . similar results were found in rose flowers  <cit> .

the wak/wakl family are receptor-like kinases linked to the cell wall and contain a cytoplasmic protein kinase domain  <cit> . atwak <dig> has been demonstrated to be an ogs receptor using a domain swap approach  <cit> , and that atwak <dig> functioned upstream of mapk during stress  <cit> . here, we found that lewakl <dig> production was promoted by the ogs at the transcriptional and post-translational levels . previous studies found that the lewakl <dig> gene can be increased early in tomato roots and in cell suspensions challenged with orobanche ramosa  <cit> . thus, lewakl <dig> may be an ogs receptor, passing signals from the ogs and activating specific lemapks or lecdpks, although further researches are needed to elucidate whether ogs can bind lewaks/wakls or how og-induced ethylene production is regulated by lewaks or lewakls.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we investigated the ogs’ acceleration of tomato fruit ripening and explained the detailed regulation of ethylene synthesis. ogs treatments of different fruit stages indicated that the ogs’ effect on ripening is developmentally regulated and that mg <dig> stage tomato fruits showed the accelarated ripening phenomenon. we also used the ethylene receptor mutant nr and several ethylene signaling defective mutants, rin, nor, and cnr, to determine the functions of the ogs on the ethylene signaling pathway. none of the mutant fruits’ ripening processes were accelerated by ogs. therefore, we demonstrated that the ogs’ functions on fruit ripening required ethylene signaling pathway and the autocatalytic regulation of ethylene synthesis. our study also revealed that the transcriptional levels of leacs <dig> and leaco <dig> were rapidly up-regulated in the presence of ogs. moreover, ogs could induce the phosphorylation of leacs <dig> at ser- <dig>  these results demonstrated that ogs induced mg  <dig> tomato fruit ethylene biosynthesis at the transcriptional and post-translational levels, and then promoted the ripening of tomato fruits. additionally, we found a candidate receptor of the ogs, lewakl <dig>  which was also induced by the ogs at the gene and protein levels.
