BACKGROUND
macrophages play an essential role in both innate and adaptive immunity  <cit> . macrophages are the indispensable part of the host defense system because of their presence in virtually every type of tissue, their capacity to contain the majority of infections in the early phase of their development, and their ability to mount specific immunological responses.

macrophages are distributed in all tissues and organs after birth. the distribution patterns of macrophages have been shown by labeling the colony-stimulated factor  <dig> receptor  promoter with green fluorescent protein   <cit>  or by specific f4/ <dig> antibody  staining of macrophages  <cit> . it has been found that distinctive morphological differences within and among macrophage populations could be attributed to their heterogeneity  <cit> . the heterogeneity of macrophages may be important for their diverse and flexible participation in immune responses. therefore, it is important to examine the phenotypic and functional differences amongst macrophages from different origins, such as spleen, bone marrow and peritoneum.

peritoneal macrophages  have been widely used as a macrophage source in mice since the 1960s  <cit> . possibly due to the low organ tension within the peritoneal cavity, pms are remarkably distinct from macrophages of other tissues  <cit> . for example, pms have higher expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and il- <dig> than do splenic macrophages   <cit> .

spms were originally located in the cords of billroth in splenic red pulp and termed red pulp macrophages, which show a high acid phosphatase activity and several detectable macrophage markers, such as f4/ <dig>  mac- <dig> and moma- <dig>  <cit> . previous studies have found that spms differ significantly from pms in their requirements for activation  <cit> , and exhibit different levels of cd40l, il- <dig> and scavenger receptors  <cit> . it has been reported in a tumor-bearing mouse study, that cytotoxicity was significantly decreased in pms,while markedly increased in spms  <cit> . however, the differences of spms with other resident macrophages have not been fully addressed.

another source for commonly used macrophages is the bone marrow. the growth of bone marrow macrophages  requires macrophage colony-stimulating factor . in the past, studies of macrophages have had a bias towards macrophages derived from one specific organ. for instance, bms have been commonly used due to their homogeneity, ability to be transfected, proliferation capacity and longer lifespan. however, the application of bms in experimental studies also has difficulty due to the instability of their phenotype and functions in vivo  <cit> . bms are relatively flexible in their response to modification; for example, their proliferation can be regulated by changing the concentration of growth factor m-csf  <cit> .

for those reasons, it is important to define differences among macrophages derived from spleen, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity. the aim of this study was to explore differences in morphology, phenotype, proliferation, phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine expression of murine spms, bms and pms.

RESULTS
morphological difference of spms, bms and pms
pms displayed a larger cell size  and higher lysosomal content than both spms and bms . spms had a more elongated spindle shape than pms and bms , and lower lysosomal content. bms contained less cytoplasm than pms or spms.

phenotype differences of spms, pms and bms
the expression of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  gr- <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhcii, b7-h <dig>  b7-h <dig>  b7-h <dig> and b7-h <dig> was examined by flow cytometry analysis. cd <dig> was expressed frequently on bms , and significantly less on spms  and pms . similarly, gr- <dig> exhibited a much more frequent expression on bms  than on spms  or pms  .

cd <dig>  cd <dig> and mhc ii are important costimulatory molecules for t cell stimulation. pms demonstrated high frequent expression of mhc ii  and cd <dig> , whereas, bms had high expression of cd <dig> . spms showed relatively low expression of cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  .

expression of other costimulatory ligands including b7-h <dig>  b7-h <dig>  b7-h <dig> and b7-h <dig> was examined by flow cytometry. the expression of b7-h <dig> was much more frequent on pms  than spms  or bms . low expression level of b7-h <dig>  b7-h <dig> and b7-h <dig> was shown for all three macrophage types .

proliferative capability of spms, bms and pms
the proliferative capability of spms, bms and pms was assessed. under culture with  <dig> ng/ml m-csf , bms showed a much stronger proliferative capability than spms and pms. bm numbers increased from day  <dig>  and continued until to day <dig> when there was a  <dig> fold increase over baseline. however, spms showed less proliferation with only a  <dig> fold increase. in contrast, there was no proliferation in pms during the  <dig> day culture .

in response to  <dig> ng/ml of m-csf , the proliferation of the three macrophage populations showed similar patterns to those with  <dig> ng/ml m-csf. the proliferation of bms and spms was much greater than that in low concentration m-csf . however, an increase of m-csf concentration up to  <dig> ng/ml did not enhance proliferation capability of pms.

capacity of phagocytosis
phagocytic capacity of these three populations of macrophages was examined. a substantial amount of fitc-dextran was taken up by the macrophages derived from the three different sources. bms  exhibited the highest phagocytotic ability compared to spms  and pms  . the mean fluorescence intensity  of bms, spms and pms was 1980 ±  <dig>  645 ±  <dig> and 1232 ±  <dig> respectively , indicating the higher phagocytotic ability of individual bms. the mfi value of pms was higher than spms indicating the higher phagocytotic capability of pms.

antigen presenting capacity
spms, bms and pms were analyzed for their ability to present ova antigen to ova-specific do <dig>  cd4+ t cells by -thymidine incorporation assay. dcs generated from bone marrow were used as positive control. each of these types of macrophage exhibited a much lower ova-specific antigen presenting ability than dcs, and there was no significant difference in the ability of presenting ova-specific antigen among the three types of macrophage .

cytokine expression profile of spms, bms and pms
cytokine mrna expression profiles were examined. under resting conditions, bms produced significantly higher levels of il- <dig> and tgf-β than spms and pms. spms produced significantly higher levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α than bms and pms. however, following lps activation, spms still expressed high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines  in comparison to bms or pms. spms expressed significantly higher level of suppressive cytokine il- <dig> and tgf-β than pms. spms also expressed significantly higher level of tgf-β than bms .

discussion
macrophages have heterogeneous phenotypes and complex functions within both innate and adaptive immune responses  <cit> . to date, most experimental studies have been performed on bms, isolated spms and pms  <cit> . however, differences among macrophages from these particular sources remain unclear. in this study, the features of macrophages from spleen, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity were compared. we found that pms appear to be more mature than spms and bms, based on their morphology and surface molecular characterizatics. bms showed the strongest capacity in both proliferation and phagocytosis among the three populations of macrophage; under resting conditions, spms maintained high level pro-inflammatory cytokine expression , whereas, bms had high level expression of suppressive cytokines ; after lps activation, spms expressed relatively high levels of all those cytokines.

in macrophage studies, macrophage cell lines including j774a. <dig>  raw <dig> , p388d <dig> and u <dig>  <cit>  can be used, however, continuous subculture of these cell lines may cause gene loss and impair macrophage immune functions. therefore, macrophages from bone marrow, spleen and peritoneum in primary culture are more commonly used. to date, macrophage studies have been performed and validated extensively using bms  <cit> , but less so with spms and pms. unlike macrophages obtained directly from spleen and peritoneum, bms can be fully differentiated in vitro from macrophage dendritic cell precursors  <cit> . although there are many advantages in using bms in immunological studies, such as their high yield, homogeneity and long lifespan  <cit> , the features of bm macrophages are not fully characterized. morphological changes of macrophages from three sources were examined to compare their maturation. consistent with the previous studies  <cit> , there are some similarities among spms, bms and pms with regard to their sphere and deeply stained nuclei, but spms and pms contained much more cytoplasm than bms, suggesting that bms may be less mature then spms and pms. when comparing cytoplasm of spms with pms, pms exhibited a larger size and lysosomal content than spms, suggesting that pms may be more mature than spms. in addition to morphological analysis, surface molecular expression could also be used, at least in part, to indicate the maturity of the three populations. a study from alatery showed that both spms and bms were not fully mature and needed to undergo a further maturation in vitro in culture  <cit> . our study detected surface molecular expression that related to macrophage maturation and function. pms had high level mhc ii and cd <dig> expression, whereas bms had high level cd <dig> and gr- <dig> expression. mhc ii and cd <dig> are expressed highly on fully functional macrophages, which also indicates their maturity  <cit> . cd <dig> and gr <dig> are usually expressed on precursors of monocytes and macrophages, indicating that the cells are less differentiated and more immature  <cit> . therefore, our study showed that pms appear to be the most mature macrophage, followed by spms, then bms. these differences are likely important considerations in the experimental use of macrophages from different sources.

following great technical improvements in the in vitro generation of macrophages, they are now considered as candidates for cell therapy  <cit> . currently, there is a much variation in the preparation of macrophages from different sources for therapeutic use. a recent study of muscle regeneration demonstrated the therapeutic potential of macrophages derived from bone marrow  <cit> . however, both the experimental and clinical use of regulatory macrophages  for treating central nervous system injury relied on generation of macrophages from peripheral blood. previously we have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of m <dig> macrophages derived from spleen, but not bone marrow, to resolve inflammation and repair the kidney injury  <cit> . we have shown a similar efficacy of m <dig> macrophages derived from peritoneum as from spleen . this demonstrates the importance of the origin of macrophages used for treating disease. in this present study, the proliferative, phagocytotic and antigen presenting ability of bms, spms, and pms were assessed. it was found that bms exhibited the strongest proliferative capability among the three populations, with spms demonstrating slight and pms no proliferative capability, suggesting that macrophages derived from spleen and peritoneum might be more functionally and phenotypically stable. this observation is consistent with our previous report that m <dig> macrophage generated from bone marrow rather than spleen showed strong proliferation in vivo and failed to protect against renal disease, apparently due to the loss of function and phenotype of macrophages linked to their proliferation ability  <cit> . in addition to proliferative ability, phagocytotic capacity of macrophages was assessed. bms have been shown to maintain the highest capability of phagocytosis  <cit> , which was confirmed in our study and may be an important consideration in regards to their therapeutic efficacy.

t-cell activation and proliferation is associated with many chronic inflammatory diseases, including chronic kidney disease, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis  <cit> . inhibition of t-cell activation is important in effectively suppressing inflammatory responses. a previous study showed that b7-h <dig> binding to its receptor, pd- <dig>  results in inhibition of antigen-induced t-cell activation  <cit> . high expression of b7-h <dig> on pms suggests pms might inhibit t cell activation more effectively than spms or bms. such a property of pms indicates a greater potential for treating chronic inflammatory diseases.

although spms, bms and pms exhibited different levels of expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation, such as mhcii, cd <dig> and cd <dig>  they showed similar antigen presenting ability. many pms are recruited into peritoneal cavity in response to bacterial infection, in greater amount than other cell types  <cit> . in spleen, several subpopulations of macrophage have been characterized in vivo, including f4/80+ red pulp macrophages, moma-1+ marginal metallophilic macrophages, er-tr9+ marginal zone macrophages and moma-2+ white pulp macrophages in mice  <cit> . f4/ <dig> is prodominantly expressed on red pulp macrophages, but not on others such as marginal metallophilic macrophages, marginal zone macrophages and white pulp macrophages. therefore, f4/ <dig> stained cells might be less diverse and could be considered as a relative uniform population. however, other subpopulations of splenic macrophages require further study.

comparison of cytokine expression profile of spms, bms and pms might contribute to the understanding of their distinct properties and provide a valuable reference for further macrophage related studies. the significantly higher expression of tgf-β and il- <dig> by resting bms in comparison to spms and pms suggests that in vitro generated bms might be potentially more likely to have a m <dig> phenotype. m-csf has been shown to induce differentiation of bms from bone marrow progenitors  <cit>  and also to induce human macrophages into a m <dig> phenotype  <cit> . compared to an only  <dig> day in vitro incubation time of spms and pms, the requirement of  <dig> days stimulation of bone marrow cells with m-csf may push them towards m <dig> differentiation. combined with high proliferation and phagocytosis ability of bm, thus suggests that bms might be less mature and phenotypically stable than spms and pms, giving caution to the use of bms in cell therapy. alternatively, pro-inflammatory cytokines including il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnf-α were significantly more highly expressed on spms with and without activation than bms or pms, which may be relevant to the specific microenvironment of spleen. in spleen, spms play an important role in removal of red cells, which may require spms to produce abundant cytotoxicity-associated cytokines such as il- <dig>  tnf-α and il- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, cytokine expression of bms, spms and pms reflect their biological function.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we report a side-by-side comparison study of macrophages derived from spleen, bone marrow and peritoneum. this study demonstrates their distinct characteristics which are likely relevant to their respective roles in immune response. it also provides a powerful reference for choosing macrophages of specific origins not only for experimental study but also for therapeutic use.
