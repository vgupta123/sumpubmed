BACKGROUND
the rhesus macaque  has served a critical role in the study of human disease for more than half a century. this macaque remains the animal of choice for much of biomedical research and is the primary model for the study of human immunodeficiency virus  and acquired immune deficiency syndrome   <cit> . though indian-origin rhesus were originally used in most research protocols, the  <dig> ban on the export of primates from india resulted in reduced availability of these animals. because the growing demand for rhesus macaques has exceeded the domestic supply, the u.s. breeding colonies have imported large numbers of these animals from china.

in recent years, a variety of studies have investigated the relationship between indian and chinese rhesus macaques. comparisons of indian and chinese rhesus mitochondrial dna  sequences, including the hypervariable sequence i , 12s and 16s rrna loci, have shown that as much as 90% of the mtdna genetic heterogeneity is accounted for by country of origin differences  <cit> . studies of chromosomal microsatellite loci have also identified marked differences in allele frequencies between indian and chinese rhesus macaque populations  <cit> . similarly, population-specific differences in the allele distributions within both class i and ii major histocompatibility complex  loci support the contention that the two populations have distinct genetic characteristics  <cit> . all of these studies support the conclusion that since their geographic separation, indian and chinese rhesus macaques have diverged to become two separate subtypes.

the genetic divergence of indian and chinese rhesus macaques is thought to underlie the observed phenotypic differences between the two subtypes in experimental protocols. these differences are observed at many levels, including morphology, behavior and physiology  <cit> . significant differences in host response and disease progression have been observed in indian and chinese rhesus macaques exposed to the same simian immunodeficiency virus  challenge  <cit> . both viremic peaks and set points were, in general, lower in the chinese rhesus macaques than in indian animals exposed to siv/deltab <dig>  leading to much longer survival in the chinese animals  <cit> . the chinese rhesus macaques are also more resistant to sivmac <dig>  maintaining both lower acute and chronic viral loads than indian rhesus macaques infected with the same viral challenge  <cit> .

because indian and chinese rhesus macaques can respond very differently to the same research protocol, consideration of animal ancestry is warranted in both study design and result interpretation. most breeding facilities in the united states include both indian and chinese-origin rhesus. although efforts are taken not to interbreed the two populations, lack of information or misinformation regarding animal history can result in unrecognized crossing of the two subtypes. the introduction of misclassified animals may compromise research results. thus, being able to correctly identify rhesus macaque ancestry, including hybrids, would be very valuable to both researchers and animal breeders.

current approaches for rhesus macaque ancestry determination include:  <dig>  sequence comparison of mtdna loci,  <cit> ;  <dig>  microsatellite analysis  <cit> ; and  <dig>  snp analysis  <cit> . since mtdna is only inherited through the maternal line, this analysis cannot identify indian-chinese hybrid animals. the microsatellite analysis involves three loci in which the allele frequencies differ significantly between indian and chinese populations. the current literature only reports five snps in  <dig> genes  that are unique to either indian or chinese rhesus macaques, identified by fujimoto  <cit> . unfortunately, though both the reported microsatellite and snp markers can work for distinguishing purebred indian and chinese rhesus, neither offers a sufficient number of markers to reliably detect hybrid animals.

we have developed algorithms for identifying primers to amplify the 3' end of all rhesus macaque genes  <cit> . over  <dig>  of the sequences we obtained using these primers were used in the design of the affymetrix rhesus macaque genechip  <cit> . we tested whether these primers could also be used to discover gene-based snps. the 3' ends of  <dig> selected genes were analyzed in  <dig> indian and chinese rhesus macaques. this effort identified  <dig> snps. four hundred and fifty-seven of these snpsappeared uniquely in either the indian or chinese rhesus macaques. a subset of those snps was further tested using a snp genotyping assay against a population of  <dig> additional chinese and indian animals, as well as  <dig> known chinese/indian hybrid rhesus. eighty-four percent of the snps were confirmed to show population-specificity. all of the known hybrids were detected with the indian/chinese snp assay panel.

the indian/chinese snp assay panel will be useful for animal ancestry determination, for the identification of hybrid animals and for the genetic analysis of the phenotypic differences that characterize the two populations. further, this work validates the efficiency of using gene-based, 3' primers to discover snps in rhesus macaques.

RESULTS
rhesus macaque snp discovery
we selected  <dig> unrelated rhesus macaques for use in snp discovery,  <dig> each of alleged indian or chinese ancestry. all of the chinese rhesus monkeys were imported directly from primate suppliers in china. however, neither records of capture site or breeding history were available to more specifically identify their geographic origins within asia. two of the indian animals had been wild-caught in northern india, while the remaining  <dig> rhesus macaques came from u.s. breeders who indicated that the animals were of indian-descent. to validate the ancestries of all of the animals, we sequenced the 12s rrna portion of the mitochondrial dnas and compared them with previously published sequences from indian and chinese rhesus macaques  <cit> . we also used the allele sizes of three microsatellite loci with disparate allele frequencies in indian and chinese populations  to corroborate the animal ancestries  <cit> . only rhesus macaques that satisfied each of these criteria for being of pure indian or chinese heritage were included in this study.

the 3' ends of  <dig> different genes were amplified and sequenced in this study, with the average amplicon length being  <dig> bp/gene . the  <dig> genes included at least one from every chromosome with the exceptions of  <dig> and y . in total we identified  <dig> snps in the rhesus macaques . all except for three of the genes  identified at least  <dig> snp, with the overall average being  <dig>  snps/gene . some genes were very polymorphic:  <dig> genes contained between  <dig> and  <dig> snps . the overall minor allele frequency  of the snps was  <dig> , with  <dig> snps having a maf ≥  <dig>  in the sample population.

to assess how the snps identified in rhesus macaques compared with those found in the same regions of the human orthologs, we identified  <dig> genes that were also analyzed in a study of  <dig> individuals of either european and african decent  <cit> . the rhesus sequences contained more polymorphisms than did the human sequences, averaging  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp in the rhesus compared with  <dig> snp/ <dig> bp in humans . none of the common snps in these gene regions were detected in both humans and rhesus macaques.

population comparison of rhesus macaque snps
we analyzed the snps discovered within each rhesus macaque population. we identified  <dig> snps in the chinese group, while the indian animals had a total of  <dig> snps . the distribution of the minor allele frequencies of the snps within each population ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . there were a higher percentage of rare alleles  and a lower average minor allele frequency  in the chinese animals than in the indian rhesus , which is consistent with the chinese population being more diverse.

a large number of snps were found exclusively in either the indian or chinese rhesus macaque populations. a total of  <dig> snps were unique to the indian rhesus macaques, while  <dig> snps were only identified in the chinese animals . almost two thirds of the chinese-specific snps were relatively rare, occurring in less than 10% of the population. however,  <dig> of the chinese-specific snps and  <dig> of the indian-specific snps had an allele frequency of ≥  <dig> . in some cases, the population-specific snp allele was the major allele in that population.  the maoa gene contained a polymorphism that was fixed in each population.

genotype assay of population-specific snps
to further explore the population-specificity of the snps, we genotyped  <dig> additional rhesus macaques at  <dig> of the snps appearing only in the indian or chinese groups. the animals included  <dig> additional chinese-origin rhesus imported from china. the indian rhesus included  <dig> indian rhesus with well-documented breeding histories, obtained from one of  <dig> u.s. national primate research centers . four unrelated animals known to be rhesus macaques hybrids based on their breeding records were also included .

the  <dig> putative population-specific snps were interrogated using the sequenom iplex assay  <cit> . six of the snps  were excluded when they were found to have  <dig> or more population exceptions, . the  <dig> remaining snps are shown in figure  <dig>  only three animals had exceptions in mao:116; each of these animals was obtained from facilities in kunming, in southwest china. one of the same rhesus macaques  also contained a second "indian-specific" allele . three other chinese rhesus harbored one "indian-specific" allele . two of the indian rhesus carried an otherwise "chinese-specific" allele .

the  <dig> hybrid animals included in the study carried both chinese and indian-specific alleles . all but one of the animals was heterozygous for the maoa: <dig> snp, with the exception being a 1/ <dig> chinese hybrid , which carried  <dig> indian alleles . three other chinese alleles appeared in this group of four animals .

discussion
this study identified a striking difference in the genome composition of indian and chinese rhesus macaques. there were 76% more snps identified in chinese than in indian rhesus macaques, a finding consistent with the greater mtdna sequence and morphological diversity described for chinese rhesus macaques  <cit> . the increased genetic heterogeneity in chinese rhesus could be a consequence of the chinese animals inhabiting a large geographic range and evolving more regional population substructure  <cit> . in addition, the reduced diversity of the indian rhesus macaques suggests this population may have experienced an evolutionary bottleneck or expanded relatively recently from a small founder population.

a surprising finding was that 69% of the snps identified were unique to either chinese or indian rhesus macaques. if the initial cohort of animals chosen for sequencing included any misclassified or hybrid animals, then the real number of private snps would be even higher. however based upon both the background screening and the genotype analysis of a larger set of animals, the initial cohort appears to have correctly reported ancestries.

thirty-eight of the  <dig> snps genotyped in an additional  <dig> rhesus were verified as being largely population-specific. a few animals carried one or two bases that were exceptions to the population-specificity, suggesting that some of the alleles may be present in both rhesus subtypes, but occur at very different frequencies. six of the chinese animals carried an otherwise "indian" allele. those allele exceptions  may be characteristic of a subpopulation of chinese animals, such as those in western china or near the myanmar border  <cit> . alternatively, the spurious population exceptions may have resulted from the intermixing of indian and chinese rhesus macaques at some breeding colonies. future studies with native populations may clarify this point.

based upon the results of an expanded genotype assay, we predict that as many as 85% of the population-specific snps identified in this study will remain largely exclusive to one ancestral group when examined in additional studies. we therefore estimate that 80– <dig> of the snps identified in this study are both population-specific and occur at high frequency . these snps will be useful for validating rhesus macaque ancestry in an efficient manor. the overall high frequency of population-specific snps also suggests that a large-scale genome array of either indian or chinese-specific snps could be generated. such an array would enable admixture studies of population-associated phenotypes.

some of the alleles queried in the  <dig> snp genotyping panel  were found to deviate from hardy-weinberg equilibrium. the apparent under representation of particular genotypes may reflect the small number of animals sampled, population substructure, or possibly selective pressure against these, or linked, genotypes.

based upon a comparison of  <dig> gene sequences that were analyzed in similar studies of rhesus macaque and human populations, it appears that the indian and chinese rhesus has about  <dig>  times as many snps as the african and european human populations. given that only  <dig> animals were included in this study, that estimate is likely to be conservative. the higher level of heterogeneity is not surprising, since the evolutionary history of the macaques is longer, affording more time for sequence variations to accumulate.

some of the snps identified in this study may be functional, disrupting microrna target sequences or affecting gene expression through another mechanism. indeed, 3'utr polymorphisms in the rhesus macaque dat  <cit>  and tph <dig> genes  <cit>  were shown to be associated with altered gene expression, and in the case of tph <dig>  with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis activity. a finding from this study was that the maoa gene contains alleles that significantly differ in indian and chinese rhesus macaques. the maoa gene encodes an enzyme that contributes to the breakdown of serotonin; thus we speculate that disparate maoa expression or activity may contribute to the different levels of 5-hiaa  and the aggressive behavior that distinguish chinese and indian rhesus macaques  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates that the 3' end of rhesus macaque genes is a rich source for identifying sequence polymorphisms. this study also demonstrates that there is a high frequency of snps that are unique to either indian or chinese-origin rhesus macaques. these population-specific snps can be used to rapidly screen and establish rhesus macaque ancestry and to identify genes that underlie phenotypes characteristic of each population.
