BACKGROUND
in their natural environment, plants encounter a vast array of pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi and nematodes. to defend themselves against infection by these pathogens, plants employ a network of intertwined mechanisms. one such line of defense is based on dominant disease resistance  genes that mediate resistance to pathogens possessing corresponding avirulence  genes  <cit> . the largest class of known r genes includes those that encode the nucleotide binding site  and the leucine-rich repeat  domains. the deduced nbs-lrr proteins can be subdivided in classes based on their amino-terminal features  <cit> . the most frequent classes possess a tir domain with similarity to either the intracellular signaling domains of drosophila toll and the mammalian interleukin- <dig> receptor or a cc domain  in the n-terminal and are named tnl  and cnl , respectively  <cit> . each domain of nbs-lrr protein is predicted to have a specific function. the nbs domain is suggested to have ntp-hydrolyzing activity , regulating signal transduction through conformational changes  <cit> . the lrr domain contains tandemly arrayed repeats in the carboxy-terminal region of r-genes and its predicted biochemical function is to mediate protein-protein interaction. it was hypothesized and experimentally confirmed that the lrr domain is involved in the specific recognition of pathogen effectors  <cit> . both tir and cc domains are assumed to be involved in protein-protein interactions and signal transduction  <cit> .

genes encoding nbs-lrr protein represent one of the largest and most variable gene families found in plants, with most plant genomes containing several hundred family members. nbs-lrr genes are unevenly distributed in plant genomes and are mainly organized in multi-gene clusters  <cit> . furthermore, results of nucleotide polymorphism analyses demonstrated extremely high levels of inter and intraspecific variation of nbs-lrr genes, which presumably evolved rapidly in response to changes in pathogen populations  <cit> . the clustered distribution of r-genes is assumed to provide a reservoir of genetic variation from which new pathogen specificity can evolve via gene duplication, unequal crossing-over, ectopic recombination or diversifying selection  <cit> . however, the specific evolutionary routes of nbs-lrr encoding genes remain elusive. several comparative sequence analyses of r-gene clusters have been performed across haplotypes or related genomes in different plant species including arabidopsis  <cit> , wild potato  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , brassicaceae  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , rice  <cit>  soybean  <cit>  and common bean  <cit> . available data suggest that different r genes can follow strikingly different evolutionary trajectories. kuang et al.  <cit>  divided nbs-lrr-genes into two evolutionary categories: type i includes genes whose evolution is accelerated by frequent sequence exchange among paralogs. consequently, their sequences have chimeric structure and a clear allelic/orthologous relationship between different genotypes cannot be easily established. type ii includes slowly evolving genes whose sequence mainly evolves through the accumulation of amino acid substitution. orthology relationships are highly conserved among accessions  <cit> .

the evolutionary rate of each domain of individual nbs-lrr-encoding genes has been shown to be heterogeneous  <cit> . the nbs domain appears to be subject to purifying selection, whereas the lrr region tends to be highly variable  <cit> . nucleotide polymorphisms found in the lrr region of r genes have been shown to be responsible for pathogen specificity  <cit> . in particular, codons encoding putative solvent-exposed residues in the lrr domain are hypervariable among different r proteins and show significantly elevated ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, suggesting that the lrr domain is subject to positive selection for amino acid diversification  <cit> .

coffee is one of the world's most important agricultural commodities and is the main livelihood of more than  <dig> million people worldwide. although the coffea subgenus coffea includes more than  <dig> species  <cit> , commercial coffee production relies mainly on two related species: coffea arabica l. and c. canephora pierre, which account for 65% and 35% of world coffee production, respectively . c. arabica l. , the only polyploid species in the coffea genus, is an allotetraploid containing two diploid subgenomes, ca and ea, which originated from two different diploid species , c. canephora and c. eugenioides, respectively  <cit> . while diversification in the coffea subgenus coffea probably occurred in the second half of the middle pleistocene , it is most likely that the allopolyploid speciation of c. arabica took place in relatively recent times i.e. from historical times to  <dig>  years ago  <cit> .

among the diseases affecting cultivated coffee, coffee leaf rust, caused by the obligate parasitic fungus hemileia vastatrix berk. & br. , is one of the most serious diseases and greatly limits arabica coffee production in almost all coffee growing countries around the world. therefore, the development of coffee varieties resistant to coffee leaf rust has been a breeding objective of the highest priority in many countries  <cit> . a number of resistance genes to coffee leaf rust have been identified in the cultivated or wild coffea gene pool. in particular, one resistance gene  has been successfully introgressed from c. liberica into agronomically important arabica cultivars. in the last few years, the genetic and physical maps of the sh <dig> locus were completed  <cit> . furthermore, using fluorescence in situ hybridization in c. arabica, the sh <dig> locus was located in a distal position on a chromosome belonging to the homeologous group  <dig>  <cit> . recently, a region of  <dig> kb spanning the sh <dig> locus was sequenced and annotated  <cit> . tandem arrays of cnl r genes were identified suggesting that the sh <dig> locus corresponds to a complex multi-gene cluster.

the purpose of the present study was to gain insight into the genomic organization and evolution of the sh <dig> r gene cluster in coffee. the agronomic importance of this locus as well as the recent origin and the perennial characteristic of coffee species make these objectives especially appealing. sequences of the sh <dig> region in three different genomes, the ca and ea subgenomes of c. arabica and the cc genome of c. canephora were analyzed to investigate the genomic organization and evolution of the sh <dig> locus. in addition, we performed comparative analyses of the identified nbs-lrr encoding sequences to identify the forces that drive evolution in the sh <dig> r gene cluster. our results highlight the importance of intra and inter subgenomic gene conversion as an important evolutionary mechanism for the evolution of disease resistance genes.

RESULTS
organization of the sh <dig> r gene cluster
the sequences of a total of  <dig> bac clones spanning the sh <dig> locus  in three coffee genomes , were examined for the presence of r-genes using the previously determined annotation  <cit> . depending on the genome concerned , a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> r-genes were identified, respectively. these sequences shared more than 95% of identity. according to chen et al.  <cit> , a r gene family is defined when 60% identity is shared by members. the r-gene sequences detected in sh <dig> were therefore further considered as members of a unique r-gene coffee family. blast analysis of the non-redundant database  revealed high similarity with several r-genes belonging to the cnl class. while the highest identity was observed with the hypothetical cnl r protein in vitis vinifera  in ricinus communis and glycine max , the most similar functionally characterized protein was the rpp <dig> gene from arabidopsis thaliana that confers resistance to peronospora parasitica  <cit>  and shares 32% of identity and more than 50% of similarity. among the species belonging to the subclass asteridae, which includes coffea, several proteins where found in solanum spp. which show 30% of identity and 50% of similarity with the r-gene family found at the sh <dig> locus of coffea.

the cnl-like sequences identified in the sh <dig> r-gene cluster were distributed in two regions separated by more than  <dig> kb . in the first region  two or three copies were found in the same orientation. the other region  contained  <dig> or  <dig> copies repeated in tandem. region a and b had opposing coding orientations. orthology relationship among r-genes was established by comparing flanking sequences and each member was identified by the group letter followed by a number. a homeologous non-reciprocal transposition event  occurred between the two genomes of c. arabica and involved a region of around  <dig> kb that includes the a <dig> and a <dig> members .

to test for the presence of a possible additional copy of the sh3-cnl in the arabica coffee genome, southern blot analysis was performed using a specific probe corresponding to a conserved part of the nbs region . whatever the restriction enzyme used, only a limited number of hybridization bands was detected. based on the restriction profiles predicted from sequence analysis of c. arabica cv. iapar- <dig> bac, it was possible to assign all the bands to one of the eight members  present at the sh <dig> locus. no additional band was detected, suggesting that this family is only present at the sh <dig> locus in c. arabica cv. iapar- <dig>  in fact, even if it is possible that additional hybridization fragments have size out of the detectable range, this should happened for all the three restriction enzymes and can be considered as a very improbable event.

the presence and number of members of this gene family in a panel of diploid coffee species were investigated by southern blot analysis . while the sh3-cnl family was always present, the number of members ranged from three to eight depending on the species. intra-specific variability was also observed for different accessions of c. canephora and c. eugenioides.

origin and evolution of the sh <dig> r gene cluster
to investigate the origin of the sh3-cnl genes present at locus sh <dig> we performed comparative analysis of the available sequences of three coffea genomes and among the sh3-cnl copies including their flanking regions. since members of the sh3-cnl family were found to be collinear in the comparisons of the three coffea genomes , we concluded that the observed organization of this locus predates the divergence between c. eugenioides and c. canephora lineages. the most parsimonious scenario for the evolution of this locus is illustrated in figure 5b. two tandem duplications and several deletions shaped region a, whereas a distant duplication/insertion event gave birth to the sh3-cnl member in region b.

locus sh <dig> was compared with the putative orthologous region in the tomato genome  which is, to date, the closest species to coffea for which whole genome sequence is available . micro-synteny was found between the coffee sh <dig> locus and two tomato genomic regions which shared  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the coffea genes, respectively , but no cnl genes were found in these regions of the tomato genome.

sequence characterization of the sh3-cnl family
the coding sequence of all sh3-cnl members is composed of two exons separated by an intron ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length. the first exon spanned  <dig> nt while the second exon extended from  <dig> to  <dig> nt . the protein sequence extended from  <dig> to  <dig> aa . the protein sequence alignment of the identified  <dig> sh3-cnl members  is shown in figure  <dig>  sh3-cnl_a2_ca was chosen as query to annotate protein domains. blastp analysis against the pfam database predicted a nbs domain between positions  <dig> and  <dig> aa, while analysis of the conserved domain database predicted the beginning of the lrr region at position  <dig> aa of the query protein. coils analysis revealed a coiled-coil region located between position  <dig> and  <dig> aa, confirming that this family belongs to the cc sub-family of nbs-lrr genes . the lrr region of all genes consists of  <dig> repeats ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> aa. these repeats are sufficiently different to ensure an unambiguous alignment of amino-acid sequences. a  <dig> bp deletions modified the reading frame of b2_ea and induced an early stop codon after the 10th lrr; similarly, an  <dig> bp insertion in the a2_ea made this member a pseudogene. both indel modifying the reading frame were disregarded in figure  <dig> and in the following analyses.

cloning of sh3-cnl_a <dig> members from diploid species of coffee
to study interspecific diversity, the sh3-cnl_a <dig> member was selected at random for further analysis. the sh3-cnl_a <dig> member was cloned from six coffee species . the cloned fragments were around  <dig> kb in size. their sequences were determined and compared with those from ca, ea and cc genomes.

sequence diversity analysis of the sh3-cnl family
using the rdp <dig> software  <cit>  and regardless of the method used for the analysis, significant traces of gene conversion were detected among the member of the sh3-cnl family, both in c. arabica and c. canephora. as an example, the conversions detected with the rdp method were reported in table  <dig>  among the nine different gene conversions detected, two events involved inter subgenomic exchanges.

p value ; begin, first nucleotide of the potential converted region; end, last nucleotide of the potential converted region; length, length of the converted region .

the dna sp program  was used to estimate polymorphism among the four sh3-cnl members in the genome of c. canephora species . the highest level of dna polymorphism was detected in the lrr domain  while the most conserved regions were in the nbs domain, especially in the p-loop, kinase  <dig> and hydrophobic domains .

to check the type of selection that acted on genes in the sh3-cnl family, the ratio between non-synonymous  and synonymous substitutions  was estimated using dnasp v. <dig>  the ka/ks substitution rate was calculated for each pair between ortholog and/or paralog members in c. arabica and c. canephora species. we also calculated the ka/ks between each pair of a <dig> members cloned from diploid coffee species together with a <dig> members from sequenced genomes . the analysis was performed on the complete coding sequence as well as on different domains . analysis also focused on codons encoding the solvent-exposed amino acids of the β-strand/β-turn motifs  in the lrr domains.

strong evidence for positive selection  was observed only for residues in xxlxlxx motifs. among the  <dig> pair combinations between  <dig> bac derived r-genes,  <dig>  of which  <dig> involving b members, appeared under positive selection . when the same region was analyzed among orthologous a <dig> members, no significant ka/ks >  <dig> was found..

discussion
organization and evolution of the sh3-cnl family
comparative analyses of r-gene clusters across different haplotypes or species demonstrated that the evolution of resistant genes is a dynamic process mostly involving duplication, deletion, sequence exchange, point mutation, diversified selection, recombination, gene conversion and retroelement insertion  <cit> . the cluster arrangement of r-genes represents an important reservoir of diversity and a source of genetic variation allowing the generation of novel resistance specificities via gene conversion, gene duplication, unequal crossing-over, ectopic recombination or diversifying selection  <cit> . to explore the organization and to characterize the mechanisms involved in the evolution of the sh <dig> locus, where a putative r-gene cluster was identified  <cit>  a ~ <dig> kb sequence was analyzed in three coffee genomes, ea and ca from c. arabica and cc from c. canephora. sequence analysis revealed the presence of a variable number of nbs-lrr genes belonging to the cc subclass at the sh <dig> locus. all these genes belong to the same family . sequence analysis of regions flanking the sh3-cnl genes helped determine the orthology relationship among the copies in different genomes. at the same time, several traces of ancient duplications made it possible to trace back the duplication/deletion events which, consistently with the birth and death evolution model, shaped the sh <dig> locus from the most recent common ancestor of all sh3-cnl copies. since the structure of the sh <dig> locus was well conserved in all three coffea genomes analyzed, one can conclude that the origin of most of the sh3-cnl copies predates the divergence between coffea species.

homologs of sh3-cnl genes were found in several dicot species including solanum spp., but comparative genomics failed to find a cnl r-gene in the orthologous regions of three rosid species  <cit>  and solanum lycopersicum. consequently, it can be suggested that the ancestral sh3-cnl copy was inserted in the sh <dig> locus after the divergence between solanum and coffea lineages.

in a similar study by david et al.  <cit>  the authors compared the b <dig> locus of phaseolus vulgaris  with three sequenced legume genomes, medicago trunculata , lotus japonicus  and glycine max . their analysis revealed that conserved microsynteny existed among legumes species, except for the cnl sequences, which appeared to be completely absent in the corresponding regions of mt and lj and only a truncated cnl was found in syntenic regions of gm  <cit> . they suggested that cnl were inserted in the ancestor of the b <dig> locus after mt, lj, and pv diverged but before the divergence of pv and gm through an ectopic recombination event between non-homologous chromosomes. phylogenetic analysis including those legume cnl sequences and all known pv b4-cnl sequences supported this hypothesis  <cit> .

structural instability induced by repetitive mobile elements is one of the mechanisms that could lead to diversification into r gene families. the presence of very similar sequences increases the possibilities of mispairing during recombination, giving rise to unequal crossovers and interlocus gene conversions  <cit> . however, the edges of the duplications involved in the birth of new sh3-cnl copies were not related to mobile elements and mobile elements identified in the region did not appear to play a role in the structural evolution of the sh <dig> locus of coffea species.

gene conversion  is more frequent among members of highly similar, tightly clustered families  <cit> . gene conversion is a common phenomenon and it has been detected between paralogs in many r-gene clusters  <cit> . sequence exchanges between different sub-genomes have previously been detected in a r <dig> resistance-gene cluster of one cnl subfamily in allohexaploid, solanum demissum  <cit> . in that study, seven of the  <dig> sequence exchanges among r <dig> homologs occurred between different genomes. two explanations were proposed: first, sequence exchanges among different haplotypes could be generated through gene conversions or alternatively, they might have occurred through recombination before speciation and have been conserved in s. demissum  <cit> . at the sh <dig> locus, gene conversion events were detected between paralogs in all three coffee genomes analyzed and also between members of the two sub-genomes of c. arabica.

conversion events were detected between sh3-cnl members independently of their orientation .the inverted orientation of the loci might allow rare interlocus gene conversion or unequal exchange while minimizing the risk of gross chromosomal rearrangement  <cit> . the gene orientation in a cluster of nbs-lrr has also been studied in rice  <cit>  and a. thaliana  <cit> . these studies demonstrated that conversion can occur between genes in the same or in opposite orientation, however conversion is more frequent in gene families arranged as direct repeats because they have higher similarity than those found in opposite orientation.

in addition, gene conversion was suggested to be more frequent in perennial than in annual plants. yang et al. <cit> , compared the gene conversion events among nbs-encoding genes in two perennial and two annual plants. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> gene conversion events involving  <dig> and  <dig> nbs-encoding genes were detected in grapevine and poplar, respectively, while only  <dig> and  <dig> gene conversion events were detected in arabidopsis and rice, respectively  <cit> . since the long-generation time of woody species slows down the accumulation of evolutionary change, the authors suggested that an excess of recent duplications and a higher conversion rate in grapevine and poplar could generate novel resistance profiles to compensate for life history traits. according to kuang et al.  <cit> sh3-cnl members should be classified as evolutionary type i  since several conversion events were detected between members.

effect of selection on molecular evolution of the sh3-cnl family
natural selection influences the molecular evolution of sequences by increasing or reducing the fixation probability of a given mutation which, respectively, increases or reduces the fitness of the individuals carrying it.

the effect of natural selection on a gene sequence can be investigated by analyzing nucleotide substitutions that occurred between two variants of this gene. since synonymous substitutions  are supposed to not modify the phenotype, their accumulation is considered not to be influenced by natural selection. conversely, non-synonymous substitutions  could increase, reduce, or not influence the fitness of the individuals carrying it; consequently, their accumulation could be influenced by natural selection. the ratio of non-synonymous  to synonymous  substitution rates could be used to infer the effect of natural selection of a given gene or a part of it. when ka and ks have similar values , one could infer a neutral effect of selection; when ka is significantly lower than ks , it could be deduced that the selection purges the gene sequence of most non-synonymous substitutions ; finally, when ka is significantly higher than ks , the selection is assumed to favor fixation of new variants   <cit> .

in many nbs-lrr genes, analysis of corresponding proteins revealed high non-synonymous:synonymous substitution ratios in the leucine-rich  domain, mainly concentrated on the putative solvent-exposed residues, indicating that the lrr domain is subject to positive selection for amino acid diversification,  <cit> . these results are consistent with the observation that nucleotide polymorphisms found in the leucine-rich  region of r genes are often responsible for pathogen specificity  <cit> .

in the sh3-cnl family, significant positive selection was only detected when the ka/ks analysis was focused on solvent-exposed residues  most frequently among paralog members. conversely, when larger regions were considered, the effect of natural selection was diluted and not detectable.

in the co-evolutionary arms race between hosts and their pathogens, genes involved in their interaction are expected to evolve under positive selection. the positive selection detected in the solvent-exposed residue of the sh3-cnl members could indicate involvement in recognition of pathogen attack.

CONCLUSIONS
the sh3-cnl family appears to have evolved following the birth-and-death model, since duplications and deletions were inferred in the evolution of the sh <dig> locus. gene conversion between paralog members from the same or different sub-genomes, and positive selection appear to be the major forces influencing the evolution of sh3-cnl in coffee trees.
