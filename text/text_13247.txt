BACKGROUND
skeletal muscle in vertebrates has evolved to be a major organ system with great adaptability in order to respond to constantly changing physical demands placed upon it. this adaptability is achieved by the ability of muscle fibers to change their contractile and metabolic properties. adult skeletal muscle consists of two major fiber groups, slow-twitch and fast-twitch. in general, slow fibers are best fit for long-lasting aerobic activity whereas fast fibers are best fit for short bouts of anaerobic activity  <cit> . at the molecular level, a coordinated expression of multiple fiber type-specific genes, both structural and enzymatic, is required to give each fiber type its unique characteristics. slow and fast muscle fibers are operationally defined by the expression of the isoforms of myosin heavy chain   <cit> . in adult rodent skeletal muscle, slow fibers are defined by the expression of myhc-β, whereas fast fibers are defined by the expression of three myhc isoforms, iia, iix/d, and iib   <cit> . in developing fetal rodent muscle, instead of myhc-iia, iix/d, and iib, there are two developmental myhc isoforms  that are expressed, along with myhc-β, at different stages of development  <cit> . after birth, expression of embryonic and perinatal myhc isoforms as well as myhc-β is significantly downregulated and the majority of the rodent muscle becomes fast myhc-expressing fibers with exception of weight bearing core muscles such as soleus where slow myhc-β is highly expressed  <cit> . in adult muscle, the main determinant of muscle fiber type is motoneuron input  <cit> . several mediators and transcription factors have been identified for the nerve dependent fiber type regulation in adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . in contrast, our knowledge about factors that regulate fiber type differentiation during skeletal muscle development is still limited. we have previously reported that sox <dig> mutant fetal and perinatal skeletal muscle exhibits a significant increase in slow fiber type-specific gene expression accompanied by a significant decrease in fast fiber type-specific gene expression  <cit> . based on these observations, we have proposed that sox <dig> functions as a transcriptional suppressor of slow fiber specific genes in developing skeletal muscle.

sox <dig> is a member of the evolutionarily highly conserved sox transcription factor family  <cit> . between mice and humans, the overall amino acid sequence of the sox <dig> protein is approximately 95% conserved, and the functional domains are 100% conserved  <cit> . the sox proteins contain the sry-related hmg box domain which mediates sequence-specific dna binding  <cit> . in general, the specificity of sox protein targets in each cell type is regulated by their cofactors  <cit> , a property that is especially important for the sox <dig> protein since it lacks a regulatory domain . therefore, when sox <dig> is involved in transcriptional regulation, cofactors of sox <dig> dictate whether the outcome is activation or repression  <cit> . for example, sox <dig> activates cartilage specific gene transcription as part of the sox trio proteins   <cit> . in other cell types, sox <dig> suppresses transcription of the fgf <dig> gene or the cyclind <dig> gene by associating with repressors  <cit> . in the case of skeletal muscle, we have shown that sox <dig> suppresses transcription of slow fiber specific genes during development, thus playing a critical role in initial muscle fiber type differentiation  <cit> .

in the present study, to start to uncover how sox <dig> regulates transcription of fiber type specific genes at the molecular level, we used a conditional sox <dig> allele  <cit>  to inactivate sox <dig> in developing skeletal muscle. the muscle specific inactivation of sox <dig> allowed us to overcome the perinatal lethality of sox <dig> mutant mice  <cit>  and obtain sox <dig> knockout  adult skeletal muscle for in-depth analysis. to identify sox <dig> target genes and assess their transcriptional status, we conducted chip-seq analyses using sox <dig> and rna polymerase ii  antibodies. combining these methods, we demonstrate that:  inactivation of sox <dig> results in an extreme upregulation in expression of slow fiber specific, cardiac and fetal isoform genes, suggesting that sox <dig> is required for the functional maturation of skeletal muscle, and  sox <dig> binds to the dna sequences in the vicinity of these genes, and thus is directly involved in the transcriptional suppression of its target genes. these results indicate that sox <dig> plays a critical role in functional specification of muscle during development.

RESULTS
the expression level of myhc-β is dramatically increased in sox <dig> ko muscle during development
we have previously shown that in the sox <dig> null fetal skeletal muscle, nascent fast muscles maintain slow myhc-β expression  <cit> . in addition to myhc-β, other slow fiber specific genes  are also upregulated in the sox <dig> null muscle, along with significant downregulation of multiple fast fiber specific genes  <cit> . based on these results, we proposed that sox <dig> functions as a suppressor of slow fiber specific genes, thus the loss of sox <dig> leads to an increase in slow muscle fibers. since sox <dig> null mutations cause early postnatal lethality  <cit> , we were unable to determine whether this sox <dig> null fetal phenotype is maintained through postnatal development. to overcome the lethal phenotype, we utilized mice carrying a sox <dig> conditional allele  <cit>  to inactivate sox <dig> specifically in skeletal muscle. to start assessing the phenotype of adult sox <dig> ko muscle, we first used the myf5-cre mouse  <cit> . in this cre-transgenic mouse, the cre recombinase under the control of the myf <dig> promoter is expressed very early in the skeletal muscle lineage ; therefore, the inactivation of sox <dig> occurs significantly earlier than the beginning of fiber type specification  <cit> . to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the sox <dig> ko muscle phenotype, we examined four different muscles in the hindlimb, the tibialis anterior , extensor digitorum longus , gastrocnemius , and soleus   <cit> . the mrna expression of the following four genes: slow myhc-β , fast myhc-iib , peroxisome proliferative activated receptor γ coactivator 1α , and succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit a  were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr  and compared between sox <dig> ko  and control  mice. as summarized in table  <dig>  sox <dig> inactivation caused a significant increase in the mrna expression of myh <dig> and a concurrent decrease in myh <dig> in the ta, edl, and gastrocnemius muscles. the sox <dig> ko soleus muscle showed the least change in expression of these two myhc isoforms . this result likely reflects the observation that sox <dig> expression in soleus is significantly lower than the other three fast muscles , therefore, sox <dig> inactivation may have had a less impact in soleus compared to the other muscles. regarding the sox <dig> inactivation levels in adult muscle, we noticed that a higher level of sox <dig> inactivation, determined by sox <dig> mrna level, did not necessarily correlate with an increase in myh <dig> mrna level. there are a few possible hypotheses to explain this observation. first, sox <dig> is not a muscle specific gene and is also expressed in fibroblasts, which can obscure an accurate quantification of sox <dig> mrna specific to muscle cells. second, the sox <dig> mutation is recessive in nature. therefore, although two independent sox <dig> ko muscle samples show 50% reduction in sox <dig> mrna level, one sample may have more homozygous sox <dig> null cells and the other may have more heterozygous cells, leading to a significant difference in myh <dig> expression. third, skeletal muscle is multinucleated, which adds another layer of complexity as to how sox <dig> inactivation in each nucleus influences myh <dig> expression in a myotube as a whole.

sox <dig> was inactivated using myf5-cre mice. a two month-old and a three month-old mice were examined. control expression level =  <dig> .

to sort out these issues, we performed immunohistochemistry to examine the sox <dig> and myh <dig>  protein expression at the cellular level in fetal, early postnatal and adult muscle. we focused our observation on the ta-edl region, composed of fast-twitch myofibers in the adult mouse. as shown in figure 1a, in e <dig>  control , nuclear sox <dig> staining was well correlated with the absence of cytoplasmic myhc-β staining. also at p <dig>  the presence of sox <dig> nuclear staining corresponded to myhc-β negative myotubes . in sox <dig> ko muscle , at both stages, nearly 100% of myofibers displayed myhc-β expression . these data show that sox <dig> expression does not coincide with slow-twitch fiber gene expression, supporting our idea that sox <dig> functions as a suppressor of the slow-twitch fiber gene program. therefore, at the protein level, the loss of sox <dig> expression clearly leads to upregulation of myhc-β during the early stages of muscle development. during the normal mouse fast muscle development, the number of myhc-β positive slow-twitch fibers significantly decreases as postnatal skeletal muscles functionally mature  <cit> . we observed this trend in the developing control mouse muscles , resulting in adult ta-edl muscle with extremely rare myhc-β positive myofibers . in contrast to the control, at e <dig>  and p <dig>  nearly all sox <dig> ko myofibers were myhc-β positive , indicating that at these early stages, muscle-specific sox <dig> inactivation led to extensive upregulation of myhc-β expression in the entire sox <dig> ko muscle. in the adult sox <dig> ko muscle, on the other hand, approximately 50% of myofibers were myhc-β positive, a significant increase compared to the control ; however a significant decrease compared to the p <dig> sox <dig> ko muscle . when sox <dig> staining signals in the control and sox <dig> ko adult muscles were compared, overall sox <dig> staining signals were lower in sox <dig> ko, however, it was hard to make a clear correlation with myhc-β staining, since sox <dig> staining in adult muscle was quite diffused . in light of this, we noticed that in control p <dig> muscle, some myhc-β-negative myofibers did not show nuclear sox <dig> staining, but rather dispersed cytoplasmic sox <dig> staining . this observation may suggest an unknown additional mechanism to relocate the sox <dig> protein from the nucleus and/or degrade it in differentiated, more mature myotubes. a recent report on six1/six <dig> double ko muscle suggests that these two proteins positively regulate fast-twitch fiber differentiation and may also influence sox <dig> nuclear localization during fetal muscle development   <cit> . in adult muscle, therefore, not only sox <dig> expression, but other mechanisms such as the six1/six <dig> regulated sox <dig> shuttling may be in place to finalize fiber type gene expression in response to the environmental cues.

in addition to the muscle structural protein genes, we also examined mrna expression of the genes playing a role in muscle metabolism, ppargc1a  and sdha in adult muscle. ppargca <dig> is a co-regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation  <cit>  and sdha is a component of tca cycle and complex ii of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, whose expression is activated by ppargc1a  <cit> . we speculated that ppargca <dig> and sdha mrna expression would also be upregulated in sox <dig> ko muscle, because of a correlation between oxidative metabolism and slow fiber content reported in adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . in spite of this expectation, neither ppargc1a nor sdha mrna showed a noticeable increase in the sox <dig> ko muscles . this lack of correlation of the two gene programs was also observed in sox <dig> ko muscles generated using mck-cre transgenic mice . in a recent report on the adult sox <dig> ko muscle phenotype, quiat et al. also reported that expression of ppargc1a was not changed  <cit> . therefore, these results suggest that sox <dig> plays a role in transcriptional regulation of the structural protein genes which define muscle fiber types, but not of the genes which define the metabolic state of skeletal muscle. in order to uncover the mechanisms of muscle differentiation that are regulated by sox <dig> at the molecular level, we next performed sox <dig> chip-seq analysis.

sox <dig> was inactivated using mck-cre mice. mouse  <dig> and mouse  <dig> are two month-old, and mouse  <dig> is three month-old. gene names in bold: associated with sox <dig> binding. gene names in italics: slow fiber specific sarcomere proteins, or transcription factors reported that are preferentially expressed in slow fibers. n.d.: not determined. u.d.: undetected in sox <dig> ko mouse. control expression level =  <dig> .

genome-wide sox <dig> binding in skeletal myotubes
to identify genome-wide binding of sox <dig> in mouse skeletal muscle, we performed chip-seq analysis. as the chromatin source, we chose wild type fetal  myotubes differentiated for  <dig> hours in vitro, because at this time point, a significant differential expression of slow fiber specific genes was observed between sox <dig> null and wild type myotubes  <cit> , suggesting an ideal time point to capture sox <dig> acting as a transcriptional suppressor of those genes. also, since sox <dig> is highly expressed in fibroblasts , using a pure muscle cell population was necessary to identify muscle-specific sox <dig> binding. we conducted two independent chip-seq experiments and obtained  <dig> and  <dig>  million reads unambiguously mapped to the mouse genome for each experiment . as a result, we identified  <dig>  sox <dig> peaks common to the two chip-seq data sets. these peaks were assigned to a total of  <dig> mouse refseq genes. the vast majority of the sox <dig> binding sites were located in intronic regions , followed by intergenic regions  or transcript end)  and 5'-upstream region   .

to determine whether any known transcription factor consensus sequences are over-represented within the sox <dig> peak regions, a motif search was performed. motif analysis using meme   <cit>  identified four known transcription factor consensus motifs in the sox <dig> peaks . when the occurrence of a single motif was set to  <dig> or  <dig> per peak,  <dig> sox motifs  and  <dig> e-box motifs  were identified. the fact that the sox consensus motifs were found in the overwhelming majority of the sox <dig> peaks  suggests that the sox <dig> binding sites identified here are bona fide sox <dig> targets. the e-box motifs  identified using the in silico method here were identical to the e-box motifs which were enriched in myod binding sites detected using c2c <dig> myotubes  <cit> . comparing our data with the myod chip-seq data obtained from adult mouse primary myotubes  <cit>  revealed that 96% of the sox <dig> peaks were localized within  <dig> bp of the myod peaks .

in addition to sox motif and e-box, runx and tead/mcat motifs were also found in the sox <dig> peaks. when the occurrence of a single motif was set to  <dig>  we identified  <dig> runx motifs  and  <dig> tead/mcat motifs . a recent report has shown that runx <dig> has a role in skeletal muscle terminal differentiation  <cit> ; therefore, runx transcription factors might be involved in muscle specific gene expression together with sox <dig>  tead/mcat elements are known to play an important role in transcriptional regulation of many skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific genes  <cit> . a significant presence of tead/mcat motifs in the sox <dig> peaks, therefore, implies possible interactions between sox <dig> and the tead transcription factors during muscle differentiation.

transcriptional status of the genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites
in order to determine the transcriptional status of sox <dig> peak-associated genes in differentiating fetal myotubes, we performed chip-seq analysis using an antibody recognizing a phosphorylated form of pol ii, which is considered to be a transcriptionally active form and associated with highly transcribed genes  <cit> . to quantify pol ii binding levels of refseq genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites, pol ii binding events in the corresponding gene regions were measured in rpkm , a unit used to quantify transcriptional levels in rna-seq analysis  <cit> . rpkm was calculated from read  numbers in peak regions, length of refseq gene regions, and total number of uniquely mapped reads . by this method, the pol ii binding level of the β-actin gene, an abundantly expressed housekeeping gene, was calculated as  <dig>  rpkm. figure  <dig> summarizes the fold enrichment of the sox <dig> peaks and the corresponding pol ii binding of the  <dig> refseq genes associated with sox <dig> peaks. we found that the majority of the sox <dig> binding site-associated genes were inferred to be transcriptionally inactive . as shown in figure  <dig> andadditional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  of the  <dig> genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites,  <dig> genes  showed no pol ii binding  and  <dig> genes  showed less than one tenth of the pol ii binding to the β-actin gene , thus 84% of the genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites are considered to be transcriptionally inactive or transcribed at a very low level in myotubes. these data strongly suggest that the binding of sox <dig> to its targets mostly results in transcriptional suppression. the rest of the sox <dig> peak associated genes were transcribed mostly at a range of low to moderate levels . there were, however, a small number of sox <dig> peak-associated genes that exhibited a high level of pol ii binding. for example, myl <dig> , tnnc <dig>  and myh <dig>  showed a relatively high level of pol ii binding . in the case of tnnc <dig>  one of the two sox <dig> peaks was identified in the first intron , where a muscle enhancer element was reported  <cit> . therefore, an unidentified enhancer element may exist in the vicinity of the sox <dig> binding sites in myl <dig> and myh <dig> 

functional characterization of the genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites
gene ontology  analysis revealed that the sox <dig> peak-associated genes showed the highest enrichment for the go categories relevant to muscle cytoskeleton and myofibril establishment . many of these genes encode muscle sarcomeric proteins which define fiber types, cardiac isoforms, and developmental isoforms in muscle. for instance, myh <dig> , myh <dig> , myh <dig> , myh <dig> , myh7b , tnnc <dig> , and tnni <dig>  were represented. the profiles of sox <dig> binding and pol ii binding for these genes are summarized in additional file  <dig>  figure s2a-e. except for tnnc <dig>  and tnni <dig> , pol ii binding levels of these genes were very low . it should be noted that sox <dig> peaks were not detected for myh <dig>  which encodes the fastest adult myosin isoform myhc-iib  <cit>  nor for myh <dig>  which encodes the perinatal fast myhc isoform  <cit> . this suggests that sox <dig> is not directly involved in transcriptional regulation of the fastest myhc isoforms expressed in fetal or adult skeletal muscle.

the thirty most enriched gene ontology  biological process terms are listed.

another noticeable go term category enriched in the genes associated with sox <dig> peaks involved regulation of transcription . for instance, sox <dig> peaks were found in the vicinity or in the gene region of transcriptional regulators including  prox <dig>  sox <dig>  tead <dig>  tead <dig>  tcf <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and nfatc <dig> . these genes  are known to play a role in not only skeletal muscle development, but also heart development  <cit> . in spite of its high expression in skeletal muscle, the role of the class iv histone deacetylase hdac <dig>  <cit>  in muscle development is yet to be discovered  <cit> .

prox <dig> encodes a transcription factor expressed in slow muscle in zebrafish  <cit> . though its role in mammalian skeletal muscle development is yet to be reported, we hypothesize that the prox <dig> protein also plays a role in slow muscle fiber differentiation in mice. to support this, we have found that prox <dig> mrna is preferentially expressed in the slow soleus muscle compared to the edl, ta, and gastrocnemius muscles in adult . therefore, the prox <dig> protein may play a role in slow fiber differentiation during muscle development as well as maintenance of slow muscle in adult. in the sox <dig> gene region, two sox <dig> peaks were detected in the fifth intron . existence of sox <dig> binding sites and very low levels of pol ii binding in the sox <dig> gene region may suggest a self-regulatory mechanism of sox <dig> transcription during skeletal muscle development, as has been recently reported for erythrocyte development  <cit> .

we also examined whether tead <dig>  tead <dig>  tcf <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac <dig> are differentially expressed between slow and fast muscles. we found that tead <dig>  tead <dig>  tcf <dig> and hdac <dig> were all expressed higher in the slow soleus muscle than the group of fast muscles, edl, ta, and gastrocnemius . hdac <dig>  on the other hand, was expressed slightly higher in the fast muscles than soleus . these results suggest that tead <dig>  tead <dig>  tcf <dig> and hdac <dig> may also positively regulate slow fiber specific genes. the association of sox <dig> peaks to these transcriptional regulatory genes suggests that sox <dig> may be indirectly regulating muscle development through these key transcription regulators.

sox <dig> binding to the genes described above was validated by chip-qpcr .

muscle specific inactivation of sox <dig> results in significant upregulation of slow fiber, cardiac, and developmental isoform genes in skeletal muscle
the observation that the majority  of the genes associated with sox <dig> binding sites show little or no pol ii binding  supports our hypothesis that a major function of sox <dig> during myogenesis is transcriptional suppression. to further evaluate this hypothesis, we next analyzed mrna expression of selected genes associated with sox <dig> binding in sox <dig> ko muscle. for this, we used mck-cre mice  to assess the effect of sox <dig> inactivation in skeletal muscle as well as in cardiac muscle  <cit> , since many of the putative sox <dig> target genes are also expressed in the heart.

first, mrna levels of the eighteen genes  were compared between control and sox <dig> ko mice using newborn skeletal muscle . sixteen genes out of the eighteen tested showed a significant increase in mrna expression in the newborn sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle . nfatc <dig> and hdac <dig> showed a tendency to be increased in sox <dig> ko muscle, even though the difference was not statistically significant . these results indicate that sox <dig> functions as a suppressor for these genes in developing muscle.

next, we assessed mrna expression of fifteen genes out of the eighteen tested above  as well as fast fiber specific genes, myogenic regulatory factors, and metabolism related genes in adult sox <dig> ko muscle . the slow fiber specific sarcomeric protein genes which had shown increased expression in sox <dig> ko newborn muscle  displayed an even greater fold increase in mrna expression in adult sox <dig> ko muscles compared to control . among the four muscle groups tested, the ta and edl sox <dig> ko muscles showed the most dramatic increase in slow fiber specific gene expression, the soleus exhibiting the least fold increase , again likely reflecting the lower sox <dig> expression in the soleus than the fast muscles ta, edl, and gastrocnemius . the fast fiber specific genes  exhibited a significant decrease in their mrna expression in sox <dig> ko muscles . myh <dig>  and myh <dig> , were either increased or decreased in different sox <dig> ko muscle groups , which may reflect the fluid nature of myhcs iia and iix/d's expression in adult skeletal muscle  <cit> . these two myhc isoforms are intermediates between myhc-β and myhc-iib when fiber type shift occurs in skeletal muscle. therefore, they could be more sensitive to the timing and level of the sox <dig> gene inactivation, leading to varied expression in the individual sox <dig> ko muscles. upregulation of the cardiac isoform genes, myh <dig> and tnnt <dig>  was also observed in the adult sox <dig> ko muscle .

the significant upregulation in the slow fiber and cardiac isoform gene expression in adult sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle likely suggests that inactivation of the sox <dig> gene early in myogenic development inhibited the postnatal maturation of the skeletal muscle. postnatal development of skeletal muscle is characterized by the progressive decline of slow fiber specific gene expression in fast muscles  <cit> . as a result, control edl and ta muscles express only a trace amount of the myhc-β protein  <cit> . the extreme upregulation of the slow fiber specific genes such as myh <dig>  tnnc <dig>  and tnnt <dig> in the sox <dig> ko fast muscles may reflect their suspended postnatal maturation. this delayed maturation hypothesis is supported by the observation that the embryonic isoform acetylcholine receptor  γ  is expressed at a higher level than the adult isoform ach-r ε  in sox <dig> ko muscles . during postnatal maturation of skeletal muscle, ach-r γ is replaced by the adult isoform ach-r ε  <cit> . in the adult sox <dig> ko muscles, silencing of chrng was not seen and chrne expression did not reach to the control level . since we have located one sox <dig> peak in the chrng promoter region , sox <dig> may be directly suppressing transcription of chrng during normal skeletal muscle development.

transcriptional regulatory genes associated with sox <dig> peaks are upregulated in sox <dig> ko adult muscle
in addition to the sarcomeric protein genes, mrna levels of some of the transcriptional regulatory genes associated with sox <dig> peaks were upregulated in the sox <dig> adult ko skeletal muscles. prox <dig> expression was significantly increased in sox <dig> ko muscles, with the highest fold increase in the ta and edl, followed by the gastrocnemius . it should be noted that prox <dig> expression is highest in the soleus in the adult control  muscles . these observations suggest that prox <dig> may play a role for sustaining slow fiber specific gene expression in adult muscle. tead <dig> and hdac <dig> also showed a slight increase in their expression in the sox <dig> ko ta, edl, and gastrocnemius muscles . expression of tcf <dig> and tead <dig>  on the other hand, showed no clear difference between sox <dig> ko and control adult muscles , in spite of their higher expression in the sox <dig> ko newborn muscle . this result suggests that sox <dig> may regulate transcription of tcf <dig> and tead <dig> in developing muscle, but this regulation may not be maintained through adult.

since it has previously been reported that myod and myogenin are differentially expressed between slow and fast muscles   <cit> , we also examined mrna expression of these genes in sox <dig> ko muscle. as shown in table  <dig>  there was no discernable change in myod mrna expression, whereas there was a small increase in myogenin mrna expression in sox <dig> ko muscles. an increase in myogenin expression in sox <dig> ko muscle suggests that myogenin may play some role in maintaining slow fiber phenotype in the adult skeletal muscle as previously proposed  <cit> .

the level of transcriptional upregulation of metabolism related genes is less than that of slow fiber sarcomere protein genes in sox <dig> ko muscle
since a close coupling between the slow fiber gene program and the oxidative metabolism gene program in adult skeletal muscle has been reported  <cit> , we also examined mrna expression of the genes whose high expression is correlated with the oxidative state of skeletal muscle metabolism in sox <dig> ko muscle . in mck-cre induced sox <dig> ko muscle, mrna levels of ppargc1a and sdha were, in general, lower than control . these results replicated the data obtained using myf5-cre induced sox <dig> ko muscle . myoglobin expression showed a slight increase in the sox <dig> ko ta, edl, and gastrocnemius . when the color of gastrocnemius and soleus muscles was visually inspected, the characteristic color difference between the two muscles in control muscle  was less clear in sox <dig> ko muscle, because the sox <dig> ko gastrocnemius exhibited an increase in redness in its color . this may reflect a small, but consistent increase in myoglobin expression in the sox <dig> ko gastrocnemius muscle . the more red muscle in sox <dig> ko muscle has been also reported by quiat et al.  <cit> . interestingly, both quiat et al. and our current report observed reduced expression in ppargc1a in sox <dig> ko muscle, which may suggest that there could be a pathway independent of ppargc1a regulating myoglobin expression in sox <dig> ko muscle. an alternative explanation for the increased redness in the sox <dig> ko muscle could be a change in capillary density. in the sox <dig> peak associated refseq genes, go terms related to vasculature development and angiogenesis were also enriched  . thus, the increased capillary density could be the cause of more red color of the sox <dig> ko gastrocnemius.

fetal isoform gene expression is upregulated in the sox <dig> ko heart
since the two cardiac myhc isoform genes, α and β , were associated with sox <dig> binding  and their expression was upregulated in sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle , we next examined their expression in the sox <dig> ko heart. in the mouse heart, expression of myhc-α and myhc-β is developmentally regulated. myhc-β is the fetal isoform in the heart and is replaced by the adult isoform myhc-α within the first week after birth  <cit> . as summarized in table  <dig> it appears that this isoform transition, fetal to adult, is incomplete in the sox <dig> ko myocardium. in the sox <dig> ko heart, myhc-β expression was sustained at an equal to a slightly higher level than control heart, whereas myhc-α expression decreased to approximately the half of the control level . to test if this is a developmental defect in the postnatal heart, we also examined expression of the developmentally regulated skeletal α-actin gene, which is expressed in the fetal heart and silenced later in adult  <cit> . indeed, skeletal α-actin mrna expression was consistently higher in the sox <dig> ko heart , suggesting that the sox <dig> ko heart is developmentally more immature than the control heart. interestingly, the expression of ppargc <dig> was also lower in the sox <dig> ko heart . since ppargc <dig> plays an important role in maturation of the metabolic state and mitochondrial biogenesis in the postnatal heart  <cit> , this result suggests that the loss of sox <dig> caused a delay in the postnatal maturation of the heart, thus sox <dig> may also be necessary for the functional maturation of cardiac muscle.

sox <dig> was inactivated using mck-cre mice. mouse  <dig> and mouse  <dig> are two month-old, and mouse  <dig> is three month-old. control expression level =  <dig> .

nfatc <dig> protein expression is highly upregulated in sox <dig> null myotube cultures
it has been reported that nfatc <dig> stimulates myogenic differentiation both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> ; however, its implication in muscle fiber type specification has not been noted. calcineurin-directed dephosphorylation of nfat factors results in their nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of their target genes  <cit> . we have located one sox <dig> peak in the last intron of nfatc <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  sox <dig> ko newborn skeletal muscle showed a small increase  in nfatc <dig> mrna expression. to assess whether the nfatc <dig> activity increases in sox <dig> null myotubes, we examined sub-cellular localization the nfatc <dig> protein using western blot. we took advantage of the sox <dig> null mouse  in our laboratory to obtain a pure population of sox <dig> null myotubes  <cit> . fetal myoblasts were prepared from e <dig>  p100h-sox <dig> null and wild type littermates and were differentiated in differentiation medium . in undifferentiated myoblast cultures, the amount of the nuclear as well as cytoplasmic nfatc <dig> protein was comparable between sox <dig> null and wild type . once myotube differentiation was induced, in wild type cultures, the nfatc <dig> protein was detected only in the nuclear fraction, whereas in the p100h cultures, a continuous presence of the cytoplasmic nfatc <dig> protein and a higher level of the nuclear nfatc <dig> protein  were observed . we have previously reported that sox <dig> expression is significantly increased upon induction of myotube differentiation  <cit> . therefore, these results suggest that a higher level of sox <dig> expression in wild type myotubes likely suppressed new synthesis of nfatc <dig>  while the absence of sox <dig> in p100h myotubes allowed continuous nfatc <dig> synthesis. these results suggest that nfatc <dig> activity is upregulated in the sox <dig> null myotubes which show a higher level of slow fiber specific gene expression.

functional analysis of the sox <dig> binding sites
in order to characterize the functional nature of the sox <dig> binding sites in transcriptional regulation, we next performed reporter gene assays. we chose five sox <dig> peak-associated genes, myh <dig> , myh7b, tnnc <dig>  tnni1and hdac <dig>  in which sox <dig> binding was validated by chip-qpcr . all of these sox <dig> peaks tested contained a sox consensus motif. firefly luciferase vectors containing each of the following sequences, ~ <dig>  kb myh <dig> 5'-upstream sequence , ~ <dig> kb myh7b 5'-upstearm sequence , ~ <dig>  kb of the tnnc <dig> first intron , ~ <dig>  kb tnni <dig> 5'-upstream region , and ~ <dig> kb hdac <dig> 5'-upstream sequence  were generated . it should be noted that the proximal sox <dig> peak in the tnni <dig> 5'-upstream region  overlapped with the previously reported slow upstream regulatory element  containing an enhancer element  <cit> .

to assess whether these sox <dig> binding sites function as a negative or positive regulatory element, the luciferase reporter gene constructs described above were transiently transfected to p100h-sox <dig> null and wild type myoblasts, differentiated in dm for  <dig> hours, after which firefly luciferase activities were compared between the sox <dig> null and wild type myotube cultures. if these sox <dig> binding sequences function as negative regulatory regions, it is expected that the luciferase activity would be higher in p100h myotube cultures in which no functional sox <dig> protein is produced. as summarized in figure 8b, four out of the five sequences tested drove a higher firefly luciferase activity in sox <dig> null myotube cultures compared to wild type, indicating that these sox <dig> binding sites function as negative regulatory sequences. the myh7b 5'-sequence did not drive a statistically higher luciferase activity in sox <dig> null myotube cultures . since the endogenous myh7b expression was higher in sox <dig> ko muscle , it is possible that the in vitro culture may not be the best approach to assess the effect of the myh7b sox <dig> biding regions. intriguingly, bell et al. have shown that sox <dig> protein overexpression in c2c <dig> cells could suppress transcription from the  <dig> kb myh7b 5'-upstream sequence  <cit> . therefore, there could be a sox <dig> binding site not detected in our chip-seq analysis which may still be functioning as a negative regulatory element in a different context.

we have previously shown that the proximal sox <dig> binding site  functions as a negative regulatory element in reporter gene assays  <cit> . in the present report, we have identified an additional distal sox <dig> binding site  which overlaps with a known muscle enhancer element  <cit> . to delineate the two sox <dig> binding sites in the myh <dig> 5'-upstrem region , the distal sox consensus sequence  was mutated in mhcβ <dig>  . as shown in figure 8b, the loss of the distal sox motif did not affect the luciferase activity in either sox <dig> null or wild type myotubes. this result suggests that the distal sox motif has little effect on transcriptional suppression from the  <dig>  kb myh <dig> 5'-region in transient assays, and therefore, at least in the current in vitro assay conditions, the proximal sox <dig> binding site is sufficient to suppress the transcription driven by the  <dig>  kb myh <dig> 5'-upstream region.

the function of the sox <dig> binding site in the tnnc <dig> first intron was determined using a hybrid luciferase reporter construct whose transcription is driven by the chicken β-actin promoter. the tnnc <dig> first intron contains an enhancer element which was previously identified using c2c <dig> and sol <dig> skeletal muscle cell lines  <cit> . the presence of this intron alone significantly increased luciferase activity in wild type myotubes , confirming the enhancer activity . the luciferase activity of the construct, actb-p+tnnc <dig>  in sox <dig> null myotubes was significantly higher than wild type, indicating that sox <dig> binding hindered the enhancer activity in this intron . unexpectedly, the construct containing only the chicken β-actin promoter exhibited a small but statistically significant increase in luciferase activity in sox <dig> null myotube cultures compared to wild type . this was likely caused by the fortuitous presence of a couple of sox motif sequences in the chicken β-actin promoter and intron sequences in the vector , which could have functioned as a weak silencer element. the 5'-upstream sequences of both tnni <dig> and hdac <dig> showed a moderate but statistically significant increase in luciferase activity in sox <dig> null myotubes .

discussion
in order to understand how sox <dig> regulates muscle differentiation at the molecular level, we have performed chip-seq analysis to identify sox <dig> targets in skeletal myotubes and extended the characterization of the sox <dig> null muscle phenotype using muscle specific sox <dig> inactivation. among the  <dig> refseq genes found to be associated with sox <dig> peaks, the overrepresented go terms included muscle structure and function, skeletal muscle and heart development, as well as transcriptional regulation. in a concurrently conducted pol ii chip-seq analysis, we found that the majority of the sox <dig> peak-associated genes exhibited little to no recognizable binding peaks, suggesting that sox <dig> mainly functions as a transcription suppressor in developing muscle.

how does sox <dig> suppress its target genes? based on evidence from this and other labs, we can speculate on two possible mechanisms  and, based on evidence accumulated in this report we also demonstrate two other likely mechanisms :  sox <dig> may fine-tune the transcription of the genes that have been marked by myod binding,  sox <dig> may modulate transcription of its target genes in concert with tead and runx factors,  sox <dig> suppresses transcription by hindering the muscle-specific enhancer activity, and  sox <dig> also indirectly influences downstream gene expression by regulating the expression of other transcription factors and chromatin modifying enzymes. below, we will discuss each of these proposed mechanisms in more detail.

myod is one of the myogenic regulatory factors and defines the myogenic lineage during development  <cit> . in myotubes, myod binding events are frequent  and are associated with histone h <dig> acetylation   <cit> , which is a marker of an active chromatin state  <cit> . we found that 96% of the sox <dig> peaks in fetal myotubes overlapped with, or were in the close vicinity to , the reported myod peaks  <cit> . the e-box motifs in the sox <dig> peak regions we found were enriched for the cagctg e-box sequence . previously, it has been shown that this motif is represented in the peaks more strongly bound in c2c <dig> myotubes compared to myoblasts, indicating that this e-box motif is mainly associated with the genes regulating muscle differentiation  <cit> . taking this observation together with ours, we speculate that myod binding in the myotube would change the chromatin environment in such a way as to allow the approach of additional transcriptional regulators by recruiting the chromatin modifying enzymes  <cit> , thus allowing the fine-tuning of muscle specific gene expression necessary for the formation of mature skeletal muscle. sox <dig> could be one of these additional transcriptional regulators and specify fiber type characteristics during muscle terminal differentiation.

we have previously reported that sox <dig> interferes with a mcat enhancer located in close proximity to the sox consensus motif in myh <dig>  causing suppression of myh <dig> transcription  <cit> . tead/mcat motifs are frequently found in enhancer or promoter regions of muscle specific genes and it has been demonstrated that binding of tef-1/tead <dig> to the mcat motifs activates transcription of these muscle-specific genes  <cit> . in our analysis of the  <dig>  sox <dig> peaks, we found  <dig> mcat motifs. this suggests that the mechanism of myh <dig> transcriptional suppression by sox <dig>  we reported earlier may be a common mechanism sox <dig> uses to suppress genes whose transcription is activated via tead/mcat motifs. our analysis also revealed  <dig> runx motifs in the  <dig>  sox <dig> peaks. currently, the roles of runx motif binding factors  in muscle development are not well known, though there are reports showing that runx <dig> plays a role in skeletal muscle differentiation  <cit> . in adult skeletal muscle, runx <dig> expression is induced by denervation  <cit> , and muscle-specific runx <dig> inactivation leads to accelerated muscle wasting in denervated muscle  <cit> . in an earlier stage of muscle differentiation, it has been reported that runx <dig> directly interacts with myod preferentially in proliferating myoblasts to inhibit terminal differentiation of skeletal muscle  <cit> . the authors showed that the runx1/cbfβ complex recruits suppressive chromatin modifying enzymes , thus inactivating transcription of the myod target genes that are necessary for the cell cycle exit and differentiation  <cit> . since the runx proteins have been shown to function as transcriptional suppressors or activators in different circumstances  <cit>  , the transcriptional outcome of the possible interaction between the sox <dig> and runx proteins needs further investigation.

as demonstrated in the results section, the sox <dig> binding sites in the tnnc <dig> first intron and the tnni <dig> 5'-upstream region both effectively reduced the activity of the enhancer elements . the molecular mechanisms by which sox <dig> overrides muscle enhancers is currently under investigation; however, the skeletal muscle myhc gene clusters may help shed light on this role of sox <dig>  in the six myhc isoform genes clustered on the mouse chromosome  <dig>   <cit> , only the myh <dig> and myh <dig> genes were not associated with sox <dig> peaks . therefore, sox <dig> may be involved in sequential expression of the myhc loci, possibly in collaboration with an enhancer element similar to the locus control region  reported for the globin gene cluster  <cit> . this is an appealing hypothesis, because it has been shown that sox <dig>  regulates sequential expression of the β-globin genes during erythrogenesis  <cit>  in concert with bcl11a which binds to the globin gene lcr  <cit> . there have been reports on transcription factories that unite transcriptionally active genes on separate chromosome regions for coordinated transcription  <cit> . it is possible that association of sox <dig> with its target sequences inhibits transcriptional initiation by pol ii, thus causing dissociation of sox <dig> target genes from transcription factories.

we demonstrated that expression of tead <dig>  tead <dig>  hdac <dig>  and prox <dig> was upregulated in sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle , suggesting that sox <dig> is a suppressor of these transcriptional regulatory genes. tead <dig>  and tead <dig>  are highly expressed in muscle tissues and have been reported to activate muscle specific gene transcription  <cit> . hdac <dig> is a class iia hdac  <cit>  and functions as a mediator of motor neuron input to skeletal muscle  <cit> . prox <dig> is expressed in slow muscle in zebrafish  <cit> . since prox <dig> is preferentially expressed in slow fiber muscle in control mice  and sox <dig> inactivation caused a sizable increase in prox <dig> mrna expression in sox <dig> ko muscle, we propose that prox <dig> also plays a role in regulation of slow muscle fiber specific gene expression in mice. this observation presents further evidence of evolutionary conservation in the mechanisms regulating muscle fiber type differentiation in vertebrates  <cit> . since there are more transcriptional regulator genes that are closely associated with sox <dig> peaks, which we did not have space to discuss in this report, it is likely that sox <dig> is part of the transcriptional networks that shape the characteristics of both muscle development and mature muscle functions.

the most striking phenotype of sox <dig> null skeletal muscle is the dramatic increase in the expression of multiple slow fiber specific genes. this observation originally led us to hypothesize that sox <dig> functions as a transcriptional suppressor of slow fiber specific genes  <cit> . in this report, we expanded the gene expression profiling of sox <dig> ko skeletal muscle by including cardiac and embryonic muscle isoform genes. cardiac isoforms myh <dig> and tnnt <dig>  as well as embryonic isoforms myl <dig> and chrng, were upregulated in the sox <dig> ko muscle . it has been reported that tnnt <dig> is upregulated in regenerating dystrophic muscle  <cit> . myh <dig> is expressed in specialized craniofacial muscle, such as jaw and extraocular muscle, but not in limb or other body muscle  <cit> . these observations suggest that sox <dig> may play a role in not only determining fiber types, but also defining developmental maturity and highly specialized functions of skeletal muscle.

in sox <dig> ko muscle, a significant decrease in fast fiber specific gene expression was also observed. this sox <dig> ko phenotype could be a secondary effect of the increased slow fiber gene products, or could be regulated indirectly by sox <dig>  since we did not find sox <dig> peaks associated with fast fiber specific genes, both mechanisms are equally plausible. with regard to indirect regulation, a few possible mechanisms can be hypothesized. for example, expression of the transcription factors six <dig> and six <dig>  activators of fast fiber specific gene expression  <cit> , could be indirectly suppressed in sox <dig> ko muscle during development. alternatively, downregulation of fast fiber specific genes in sox <dig> ko muscle could be caused by changes in microrna expression. micrornas are known to function as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression  <cit> . a recent report indicates that micrornas suppress target gene expression predominantly through mrna degradation  <cit> , thus, it is plausible to postulate that an increase in micrornas targeting fast fiber specific genes in sox <dig> ko muscle leads to reduced fast fiber specific gene mrna levels. as described above, we found sox <dig> binding peaks associated with myh <dig> and myh <dig> . in the intron sequences of myh <dig> and myh <dig>  mir-208a and mir-208b are encoded, respectively  <cit> . it has been reported that mir- <dig> suppresses expression of thrap <dig>  which promotes fast fiber specific gene expression  <cit> . the increased transcription of myh <dig> and myh <dig> in sox <dig> ko muscle, therefore, could lead to upregulation of mir- <dig>  which in turn, suppress fast fiber specific gene expression. however, the actual situation is likely to be more complex. it should be noted that mir- <dig>  along with mir- <dig>  also targets the 3'-utr region of sox <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> is encoded in the intron of myh7b  <cit> , which has a sox <dig> binding site in its 5'-upstream region . since myh <dig>  myh <dig>  and myh7b are all negatively regulated by sox <dig> , these data suggest that sox <dig> and these mirnas constitute two-way feedback loops.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that:  sox <dig> directly suppresses the transcription of slow fiber-specific, cardiac, and embryonic isoform genes through binding to the transcriptional regulatory regions,  sox <dig> regulates expression of transcriptional regulators critical for muscle development, therefore, extending its effect on muscle development by cross-talking with other regulatory pathways,  loss of sox <dig> in skeletal muscle results in a significant increase in expression of slow fiber-specific, cardiac, and embryonic isoform genes which are associated with sox <dig> binding peaks, accompanied by a decreased in fast fiber-specific gene expression, and  loss of sox <dig> in cardiac muscle results in increased expression of fetal isoform genes in the adult heart, which suggests that sox <dig> is required for the postnatal maturation of cardiac muscle as well. since the sox <dig> ko phenotypes reported here have relevance to muscle degenerative diseases  <cit>  as well as heart failure  <cit> , uncovering the many functions of sox <dig> in muscle development will likely contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of human muscular diseases.
