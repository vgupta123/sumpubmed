BACKGROUND
functional roles for both coding and non-coding rna molecules have been increasingly appreciated in a variety of biologic processes, including gene regulation, molecular trafficking, and protein translation 
 <cit> . for example, mrnas of coding genes are increasingly recognized as targets of translational regulation by a variety of mechanisms 
 <cit> . additionally, thousands of long non-coding rnas have recently been identified 
 <cit>  and a growing number of these are being assigned discrete biologic functions 
 <cit> . strategies to identify multiple rnas binding an individual protein of interest have advanced further than those designed to identify multiple proteins binding a given rna. examples of the former include immunoprecipitation followed by microarray hybridization  or sequencing  
 <cit> . available approaches to accomplish the latter include rna pull-downs in which proteins bound to biotin-labeled rna are isolated and analyzed by techniques including mass spectrometry 
 <cit> . the capacity to rapidly identify multiple proteins binding to an individual rna of interest will allow characterization of the molecular mechanisms of action and the functional role of specific rnas in human disease.

the recent use of protein microarrays in yeast 
 <cit>  suggests a similar approach may be of utility in the more complex human setting. commercially available human protein microarrays were designed for detection of protein-protein interactions using protein or small molecule probes. as protein microarrays permit high throughput screening for intermolecular interactions, they may also provide an alternative approach to study human protein-rna interactions, an application in which they have not yet been reported. here, we demonstrate a high-throughput methodology allowing rapid identification of the proteins binding to a given human rna molecule using a protein microarray containing ~ <dig>  human recombinant proteins spotted in duplicate. as a result of this approach we identify previously uncharacterized interactions between hras rna and cnbp protein, as well as human stau <dig> and tp <dig> rna and show that stau <dig> influences tp <dig> rna stability in the context of transcriptional blockade.

RESULTS
to define rna-protein interactions, we utilized sense and antisense strands for  <dig> rna transcripts representing protein coding rnas tp <dig>  hras, myc, bcl <dig> and non-coding rnas pwrn <dig>  sox2ot, occ <dig>  igf2rnc, lncrbm <dig> and dleu <dig>  the schematic diagram of the workflow used in this work is presented on figure 
1a and a detailed protocol of probe preparation, labeling and hybridization conditions are included in experimental procedures section as well as in additional file 
1: figure s <dig> and additional file 
2: table s <dig>  briefly, the aforementioned rnas were in vitro transcribed, labeled with cy <dig> and independently probed on human protein microarrays. the labeling process was optimized in order to achieve ~  <dig> pmol dye per μg rna with an average efficacy of  <dig> dye molecule for approximately every  <dig> bp rna  to minimally influence rna native structure while yielding signal intensities that are readily visualized .

in order to determine the reproducibility of rna-protein interactions observed with this technology, we performed technical replicates of hras sense rna incubation to the microarray. comparison of the ratio of signal intensity above background of every spotted protein between the two independent replicates demonstrated suitable results with a pearson correlation of r2= <dig>  . we next analyzed the distribution of the signal within each array to establish filtering criterion for rna-protein interaction significance. a representative distribution of signal intensities for all proteins from the tp <dig> sense rna array displaying deviations from the global mean  is shown on figure 
1d. it is notable that there is a large fraction of proteins that display a signal intensity ratio over background of  <dig>  suggesting the absence of a global non-specific fluorescence. we selected filters allowing identification of the significant rna-protein binding events based on a z-score ≥  <dig>  and a minimum signal above background of  <dig>  fold. gene lists of all significant hits from all hybridized rnas in this study were generated , and overlaps of hits from the two technical replicates of hras sense rna probed to protein array resulted in a significance of p < 10- <dig> .

next, functional characterization of the proteins that significantly bound to rnas used in this study was performed. of the  <dig> spotted proteins – not including spotted protein controls – only  <dig> proteins significantly bound to at least  <dig> of the  <dig> rnas. these  <dig> rna binding proteins were strongly enriched for protein family domains compiled in the pfam database that have previously been identified in rna binding, including the rna recognition motif, rna binding domain, zinc finger and k homology domains . gene ontology  terms associated with rna binding, rna processing, and rna splicing among others were strongly enriched . taken together, these findings demonstrate the selectivity of this technique to detect rna-protein interactions.

we selected a subset of these proteins that most frequently bound rnas  for further domain analysis . interestingly, while  <dig> out of  <dig> of these “common rna binding proteins” contain motifs or domains previously characterized for rna binding capacity, several proteins such as ung, kcnab <dig>  stk <dig>  page <dig> and nudt16l <dig> contain no well-characterized rna interaction domains despite repeated significant rna-protein binding events observed in at least  <dig> out of  <dig> rna incubations to the protein array . among these proteins, nudt16l <dig> contains no defined domain at all and page <dig> has no known function except its specific expression in variety tumors. in addition, a comparison of the  <dig> common rna binding proteins to those identified by recent par-cl and par-clip-seq studies 
 <cit>  demonstrates that 21/ <dig> and 18/ <dig> of these proteins, respectively, demonstrate rna binding ability including nudt16l <dig> 

rrm – rna recognition motif, pcbp_like_kh – poly r binding protein like k homology domain, kh – k homology rna binding domain, kh-i – k homology rna binding domain type i, sf1_like-kh – splicing factor k homology rna binding domain, zf-ccch – zinc-finger of ccch  type, dsrm – double-stranded rna binding motif, aldo_ket_red – aldo-keto reductase, tas – predicted oxidoreductase, udg_f <dig> – family  <dig> of uracil-dna glycosylase, rpa1n – replication protein a n-terminal ob fold domain, rpa1_dbd_c – replication protein ssdna binding domain dbd-c, pkc_like – protein kinase c family, gage – gage protein family.

rna application to human protein microarrays therefore identified a set of human proteins with a broad capacity for binding to multiple rnas that contain known rna binding motifs as well as identified a number of new proteins for future study that contain no canonical motifs and no previously known rna binding capacity. to further narrow the lists of candidate rna-protein interactions, we selected proteins that significantly bound sense, but not antisense rnas, although some biologically relevant interactions may take place with both sense and antisense transcripts from a given locus. this analysis resulted in  <dig> interactions, revealing a substantial range of protein binding between individual mrnas and non-coding rnas and identified specific interactions for further study .

to perform biochemical validation of our findings we selected  <dig> of these newly identified interactions and studied rna-protein binding using reciprocal pull-down experiments. first, staufen <dig>  was identified as a protein-binding target of tp <dig> mrna using protein microarrays with signal over background  <dig> -fold, z-score  <dig>  . tp <dig> mrna, but not its antisense or any other rna transcripts, displayed a specific interaction with the duplicate stau <dig> protein spots . antibody to an ha epitope-tagged stau <dig> protein immunoprecipitated tp <dig> mrna but not control rnas in both in vitro and in vivo rna-protein pull-down assays . conversely, using reciprocal rna pull-down experiments, biotin-labeled tp <dig> mrna – but not biotin-labeled controls – pulled down stau <dig> protein . therefore, two-way pull-down experiments confirmed the novel tp <dig> mrna-stau <dig> protein interaction identified using human protein arrays.

a second interaction validation was undertaken for the ring-type cchc-zinc finger, nucleic acid binding protein , which bound hras mrna on the protein microarray with signal over background  <dig> -fold, z-score  <dig>  . the biotin-labeled hras mrna, but not biotin-labeled controls, pulled down cnbp protein . moreover, in the complementary pull-down experiments, antibody to ha epitope-tagged cnbp protein immunoprecipitated hras mrna but not control rnas both in vitro , as well as in vivo . these two-way studies of two independent, novel targets support the validity of rna-protein interactions detected by rna incubation to the human protein microarray and further verifies the capability of this method.

to further address significance of tp <dig> association with stau <dig> protein, several deletion mutants spanning the utrs of tp <dig> rna were generated and used for stau1-ha protein pull-down . although we could not identify any known stau <dig> binding sequence motifs 
 <cit>  within the tp <dig> utr, pull-down experiments indicated that stau <dig> protein preferentially binds within a  <dig> bp sequence of the tp <dig> 3′utr. moreover, repeated incubation of the tp <dig> open reading frame to the protein array demonstrated absence of binding signal to stau <dig> duplicate spots , while the full-length tp <dig> rna showed binding , confirming the finding that stau <dig> protein binding takes place within the tp <dig> 3′utr.

stau <dig> protein is known to be involved in several cellular functions including rna decay  
 <cit> , rna transport 
 <cit> , rna translation 
 <cit>  and modulation of stress response 
 <cit>  via shuffling between polysomes and stress granules. to explore consequences of stau <dig> binding to tp <dig> rna we studied tp <dig> rna stability in stau <dig> and upf <dig> deficient cells. unexpectedly, we found that although upf <dig> depletion did not affect overall tp <dig> rna levels , stau <dig> knock down caused reduction in tp <dig> rna half-life in actinomycin d treated primary fibroblast cells, under conditions known to halt synthesis of newly formed rna molecules . moreover, after introduction of the full-length tp <dig> and tp53-orf  in tp <dig> negative h <dig> cells, stau <dig> knock down caused reduction in the full-length tp <dig> rna half-life but did not affect tp53-orf rna after actinomycin d treatment . these initial findings indicate that stau <dig> protein binding to tp <dig> rna may play a role in preserving tp <dig> rna levels in the setting of a transcriptional blockade.

the diversity of naturally occurring rna-protein interactions is only beginning to be appreciated and rna hybridization to human protein microarrays may be a useful complement to current platforms in a number of ways. for example, this approach can be used to gain mechanistic insight into newly identified long non-coding rnas by understanding the proteins to which they bind. the ability to test the binding capability of any coding or non-coding rna to thousands of proteins simultaneously will significantly improve the pace of mechanistic analyses of rnas. in this regard, it may provide a complement to biotin-labeled rna pull-down/mass spectrometry-based approaches, which have proven successful in identifying rna binding proteins 
 <cit>  but require substantial amounts of cell-derived starting material and are laborious and time-consuming. rna hybridization to human protein microarrays, in contrast, requires minimal amounts of rna and can be completed in less than one day. however, the use of entirely recombinant components for this method precludes the detection of rna-protein interactions that 1) require intact protein complexes, 2) require post-translational modifications of protein, and 3) take place with proteins not spotted on the array.

rna hybridization to human protein microarrays may also help to understand proteins that bind and regulate the stability, localization, or translational control of protein coding transcripts. in this regard, stau <dig>  a known rna-binding protein implicated in both rna stability and localization 
 <cit> , was shown in this work to regulate tp <dig> in an as yet previously uncharacterized way. similarly, the binding of cnbp to hras rna may also modulate ras function. moreover, it is intriguing to note that human genetic disorders arising from mutations in both cnbp  and hras , while displaying distinctive features, both display profound abnormalities in muscle tissue. similarly, we observed the prader-willi syndrome associated long non-coding rna, pwrn <dig>  to bind the spata <dig> protein, which has been linked to apoptosis of spermatogenic cells 
 <cit> . as hypogonadism is a known symptom of prader willi syndrome, this observation may provide a functional link between this non-coding rna and its associated human disease. incubation of specific human rnas of interest to human protein microarrays may therefore help characterize mechanisms of rna function and may also stimulate efforts to identify potential uncharacterized links in the pathogenesis of human disease.

CONCLUSIONS
here we describe a refined methodology for rapid and large-scale identification of novel human rna-protein interactions. rna hybridization to human protein microarrays described here offers several attractive features. first, the reagents required are readily available, consisting of minimal amounts of in vitro transcribed rna and standardized, commercially available protein microarrays. second, rna hybridization to human protein microarrays does not require large-scale cell culture for protein isolation and mass spectrometry, and hence it is far less laborious than current rna chromatography techniques. third, this technique is rapid, taking less than a day to complete. biochemical verification of newly identified rna-protein interactions using this technique via reciprocal and independent pull-down experiments performed here moreover suggests that there are many undiscovered human-rna protein interactions and that this approach may be helpful in identifying them.
