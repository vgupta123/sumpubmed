BACKGROUND
sixty years ago, in  <dig>  esther lederberg discovered phage lambda  <cit> . since this seminal discovery lambda has become a model organism in which many foundational studies lead to our current understanding of how genes work and how they are regulated, as well as how proteins perform such functions as dna replication, homologous and site-specific recombination, and virion assembly. in addition, tailed phages are the most abundant life form on earth  <cit> , and so deserve to be studied in their own right and in the context of global ecology. nevertheless, phage lambda is not completely understood. there are still a number of genes in its  <dig>  kb genome whose function remains only vaguely defined, if at all. for instance, many of the genes in the b <dig> and nin regions have no known function . and  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted lambda proteins have unknown functions.

two of the best-characterized aspects of lambda biology are the genetic switch that determines whether a phage reproduces and lyses the cell or whether it integrates into its host genomes to become a prophage  <cit>  and the mechanisms through which transcription antitermination controls its gene expression cascade. nevertheless, lambda continues to yield new insights into its gene regulatory circuits  <cit> , and recent studies of its dna packaging motor are in the vanguard of nanomotor research  <cit> .

surprisingly, even the structure of the lambda virion is incompletely known: the structures of only  <dig> of the ~ <dig> proteins in the virus particle have been solved, and it is unknown whether several proteins that are required for tail assembly are in the completed virion, even though the overall structure is well known from electron microscopy  <cit> .

key to the understanding of lambda biology is a detailed understanding of protein function, including their interactions. we have curated more than  <dig> protein-protein interactions  from the literature, identified over the past  <dig> years. such interactions are reasonably well known within the virus particle and during the life cycle of lambda, i.e. during replication and recombination. however, the molecular details of virion assembly, obviously highly dependent on coordinated interactions of structural and accessory proteins, are still largely mysterious.

the structures of at least  <dig> lambda proteins have been solved . in addition, the lambda head has been studied in some detail by cryo-electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and nmr . the tail is much less well known. while we do have structures of the head-tail junction proteins w, fii, and u individually, their connections to the head via the portal protein  and to each other are not very clear. similarly, while we do have a structure of the major tail tube protein v, the remaining tail is structurally largely uncharacterized.

* ser/thr protein phosphatase

our motivation for this study was three-fold: first, in our continuous attempts to improve the yeast two-hybrid system further, we thought that phage lambda would be an excellent "gold-standard" to benchmark our experimental system by demonstrating how many previously known interactions  we are able to identify in such a well-studied system. second, we believe that interaction data can help to solve the structures of protein complexes, since binary interactions as described here may facilitate the crystallization of co-complexes. despite its well-understood biology, phage lambda is not well understood structurally; especially the assembly of its tail remains poorly understood. third, and possibly most important, we wondered if we could contribute to the understanding of lambda biology, either by discovering new interactions or by verifying questionable or poorly supported interactions.

bold: found in this study. * unpublished , # interactions not tested in y2h assays .

to achieve these goals, we cloned almost all lambda open reading frames  and tested them for all pair-wise interactions, using a novel yeast two-hybrid strategy  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig> unique interactions, most of which have not been previously described. about half of all published interactions were identified, and we will discuss why the other half has been missed and how these interactions might be detected by future two-hybrid studies.

RESULTS
approach
in order to find as many interactions as possible, we cloned  <dig> lambda orfs into six different y2h vectors . in fact, each vector pair results in very different subsets of interactions as we have shown previously  <cit> . for example, the pgadt7g/pgbkt7g vectors yielded  <dig> interactions while the pgbkcg/pgadcg vectors yielded only  <dig>  the main difference between these two pairs is the way the fusion proteins are constructed: in the former two vectors the gal <dig> dna-binding  and activation domains  are fused to the n-terminus of the lambda proteins . in the latter two the dbd and ad are fused to the c-terminus of the lambda proteins. it is thus reasonable to assume that structural constraints cause many of the observed differences.

* redundant, i.e. some interactions are found with multiple vectors.

fusion proteins indicate the location of the dna-binding  and activation domains , respectively, of each vector pair. for instance, the pdest vectors both have the dbd and ad fused at the n-terminus of the bait and prey protein. vectors are listed as bait/prey pairs.

assay sensitivity and false positives
as we have observed before in other contexts  <cit> , the pgadt7g/pgbkt7g vectors yielded almost half of all interactions discovered in this study and almost three times as many as the pdest series of vectors . the pdest system may detect fewer interactions but they probably also detect fewer false positives .

in a previous study we benchmarked the false positive rate for each y2h vector systems under different screening  conditions  <cit> . to evaluate the accuracy of the vector system we used specificity estimates from this study  <cit>  . the sensitivity was estimated using known lambda interactions . specificity ranged from most specific, namely  <dig> % for gadt7g/pgbkt7g and pgbkt7g/pgadcg to  <dig> % for pgbkcg/pgadt7g . sensitivity ranged from  <dig> % for pgbkt7g/pgadcg to 17% for pgbkcg/pgadcg and pdest22/ <dig>  for each method, we estimated the probability of being a true interaction using bayes theorem: pdest22/ <dig> , pgadt7g/pgbkt7g , pgbkt7g/pgadcg and pgbkcg/pgadcg , and pgbkcg/pgadt7g  .

verification and quality scores
if an interaction is found in more than one vector combination, the reliability is higher than when it is found in only one. twenty-four interactions  were found in  <dig> or more vector combinations . this number of combinations can be used as a score, and the  <dig> interactions with the highest score have all been described in the literature before. of the  <dig> high-scoring interactions, six  have been described before . to test if the difference of the proportions of detected literature interactions is greater for the more than one vector combination group, we carried out a one-sided test for difference of proportions. the null hypothesis can be rejected for alpha =  <dig>  indicating a moderately significant difference  . we conclude that the number of supporting vector combinations can be used as a confidence score. this suggests that the  <dig> novel high-scoring interactions are possibly physiologically relevant interactions and thus good candidates for further studies .

bfun = bait protein function, pfun = prey protein function group . nn, cn, nc, cc indicated the fusion type of the bait and prey proteins . the two nn vectors are indicated by g  and d . interaction that have been found in inverted prey-bait combinations are indicated by a prime sign . interactions that have been found in both bait-prey and prey-bait orientations are indicated by bold and primes , respectively. interactions without any note are unexpected and may not be physiologically relevant. 2v = interactions found with  <dig> vector pairs. stf = orf <dig> 

of the  <dig> interactions that were found in only one combination,  <dig> have been published previously, demonstrating that they are useful too. in fact,  <dig> out of  <dig> previously found interactions were also found in our screen, i.e. 53%. note that three previously found interactions  could not be tested since we were unable to obtain orf clones of j, xis, ninh, and esc .

prey counts
there are other criteria that can be used to score interactions. one of them is the number of times a prey protein is found. this "prey count" indicates whether a protein interacts very specifically  or more unspecifically and thus promiscously. proteins with high prey counts are more likely false positives, and hence we removed these interactions with prey count >  <dig> from further analysis . however, this was not generally true in our study: of the preys that were found  <dig> to  <dig> times,  <dig> were found among the "gold-standard" literature interactions. of the preys that were found  <dig> to  <dig> times,  <dig> were involved in such gold-standard interactions .

protein coverage
among the  <dig> lambda proteins listed in the uniprot database ,  <dig> were found to be involved in interactions , which represents 70% of the proteome.  <dig> proteins were found only in one interaction  but  <dig> proteins were found to be involved in  <dig> or more interactions . hence the former are more specific and latter more promiscous and thus less reliable. interestingly, several proteins were conspicuously absent from our list of interactions, primarily proteins of head and tail assembly  as well as the poorly understood proteins ning, ninh, orf <dig> , orf <dig> , and sieb .

functional specificity
we grouped all lambda proteins in  <dig> groups, namely virion head, virion tail, transcription, replication, recombination, lysis, lysogenic conversion, others with known function, and unknown . a statistical analysis of interactions shows that proteins involved in head assembly have the highest specificity : when interactions among different functional classes are considered, the proteins involved in capsid assembly tend to interact with themselves more frequently compared to other functional classes. interestingly, the proteins of unknown function show interactions with proteins involved in several functional classes, including tail assembly, transcription and recombination .

overall, the  <dig> protein-protein interactions  of our screens correspond to ~ <dig> % of the lambda search space , i.e. all possible protein pairs of the lambda proteome . this is significantly less than we found in streptococcus phage dp <dig>  namely  <dig> interactions among  <dig> orfs  <cit>  even though in the latter case only  <dig> vector pairs were used. a possible explanation is that we used a more rigorous retesting scheme here in which only interactions were counted that were found in multiple rounds of retesting.

discussion
lambda protein interaction network
this is only the second study that has applied multiple two-hybrid vector systems to characterize the protein-protein interactions at a genome scale, the first being our analysis of the varicella zoster virus  <cit> . the lambda protein network connects  <dig> proteins of unknown function with well characterized proteins, which should shed light on the functional associations of these uncharacterized proteins . for example, nini interacts with two proteins n and q which are involved in transcription antitermination. the scaffolding protein nu <dig> forms dimers, and interacts with the tail proteins z and m as well as the capsid protein e. thus, nu <dig> may play an accessory role in the assembly of both head and tail, even though nu <dig> is not absolutely required for tail assembly.

false negatives
this study discovered more than 53% of all published interactions among lambda proteins. however, it failed to discover the remaining 47%. we can only speculate why this is the case. some of the early steps in virion assembly depend on chaperones  <cit> . for instance, the portal protein b requires groes/el, most likely for folding  <cit> . these chaperones are not present in the yeast cells which we used for our interaction screens. we found only one of five known interactions of b  and aberrant folding in yeast may be the reason for not detecting the other four known interactions. in addition, several lambda proteins are processed during assembly. for instance, the c protease is processed and covalently linked to the capsid protein e. this fusion protein is then further processed to yield products named "x1" and "x2" even though recent attempts to identify x <dig> and x <dig> were unsuccessful and thus x <dig> and x <dig> may be artifacts  <cit> . a  <dig> amino acid peptide is also proteolytically removed from the portal protein b but it is not known how this affects its interaction properties. finally, protein s, which forms a membrane protein involved in lysis, is made in two variants that use different start codons. in fact, we do find that the shorter variant, s'  has a slightly different interaction pattern compared to the full-length variant, s  . we have not investigated the detailed mechanism of these differences but it has been shown in several studies that fragments of proteins show different interaction patterns than their full-length proteins  <cit>  even though this is an extreme case given the small difference between s and s'. while sterical hindrance may be an obvious reason for this behavior, little is known about the mechanistic details in most other published cases.

false negatives may also be a result of the obligate stepwise assembly of large protein structures in lambda and other phage, e.g. when a conformational change due to interaction between two proteins creates a new binding site for a third protein. for instance, in phage t <dig> only the heterodimer of gp <dig> and the host thioredoxin provides a binding site for the single-stranded-binding protein  and the primase-helicase gp <dig>  <cit> . such cases can only be detected if all three proteins were expressed simultaneously and the constructs involved allowed the formation of complex oligomers.

false positives
while we found only 53% of all previously known interactions of lambda, we also found many new ones . however, many of the new interactions have only been found once and hence are lower confidence interactions. on the other hand, nine of the previously published interactions were found only once in our screen but are nevertheless well-known interactions. in order to verify the biological significance of new interactions further criteria or experiments are required. one criterion often used is the plausibility of an interaction: if two interacting proteins belong to the same functional group, they are likely physiological.  <dig> of the  <dig> interactions  take place within their functional group, including the  <dig> known ones. some of the remaining interactions are discussed below in the context of their functional group.

some proteins appear to be particularly "sticky". for example, g, a tail protein, is involved in  <dig> different two-hybrid interactions. the specificity of such interactions is inversely proportional to the number of such interactions; thus, g likely interacts rather unspecifically, and its interactions have to be interpreted cautiously. similarly, int, a, nu <dig>  and u are involved in  <dig> or more two-hybrid interactions each, and thus each interaction has to be evaluated individually keeping in mind its promiscuity. we have attempted a careful manual evaluation in table  <dig> 

the reason for interaction promiscuity and thus false positives remains unclear. several hypotheses have been proposed to explain such cases. for example, a protein may have hydrophobic patches that interact unspecifically. some authors have suggested that simply an increase in abundance might cause a promiscuous gain of interactions  <cit>  but such theories remain to be tested rigorously.

the y2h assay appears to be sensitive enough to detect weak interactions that are not detectable in nmr experiments, e.g. the interaction between u monomers  <cit> . the high sensitivity may also explain a significant number of false positives which may have been detected in our screen but which do not have any physiological significance. future quantitative measurements are thus required to clarify the relationship between affinity and physiological relevance.

head assembly and structure
the structure of the lambda protein shell is known in great detail  <cit> . however, its assembly is much less well understood as are the locations and functions of the "minor" proteins that are present in only a few molecules/virion . the portal protein b is believed to be the nucleator or initiator of head assembly, which first assembles with the c protease and with the scaffolding protein nu <dig> into an ill-defined initiator structure. b, c, and nu <dig> are known to form a complex in which several interactions have been previously reported . we could not detect b in any interaction although we did find nu3-c, nu3-nu <dig> and nu <dig> interactions with e and z. this is noteworthy because nu3-e and nu3-z are new interactions. it is known that e  assembles onto or around the initiator structure to form the procapsid  <cit> , and it is conveivable that b joins such an assembly. if nu <dig> and c proteins are both required for b to join, we would have missed this interaction, given that we tested only pairs of proteins. nu <dig> also appears to form dimers by the y2h analysis, and this has been confirmed independently .

the head shell is bound by the d protein which stabilizes the coat protein shell. however, if nu <dig>  a, or fi are missing, dna is not packaged and as a consequence, the coat shell does not expand, and d can only add after expansion. we could confirm the a-nu <dig> interaction as well as the interactions between fi and a and fi and e which were previously known only from genetic experiments  <cit> . we also confirmed the d-e and e-e interactions.

the terminase and the portal proteins are the largest proteins of the lambda head. using fragments of these proteins as baits - as opposed to full-length proteins - may result in additional interactions, especially since we were not able to detect most of the b interactions reported in the literature .

tail assembly and structure
tail assembly is even less well understood than head assembly . from genetic analyses it is known that the host receptor protein j initiates the process with i, l, k, and g  successively joining the process  <cit> . older studies suggest a slightly different order of action, namely j > i > k > l  <cit> . in fact, it is not known if i, l and m are components of the finished virion or are assembly factors that are not present in virions. it is thus difficult to reconstruct the detailed molecular events during tail assembly. in any case, j eventually associates with the tape measure protein h, and the major tail protein v forms a tube around this central rod. u finally joins the head-proximal part of the tail. similarly, w and fii join to the portal protein in the head to form the binding site for the tail. the main tail proteins are connected by known direct protein-protein interactions  but the interactions during the initiation of tail assembly have eluded previous studies. in fact, we failed to detect any interaction involving j and i, and the only interactions of l and k did not involve other tail proteins . however, we did find several new interactions that are potentially relevant for tail assembly. for instance, g, a fairly promiscous protein with a total of  <dig> interactions, was found to bind to v, g, t, h, and m. it is thus possible that it acts as a scaffold organizing the assembly of the tail. by contrast, the interactions of h and v with g were their sole tail-related interactions. we did not find the tail fiber proteins stf and tfa to interact with other tail proteins in our screens. stf has been speculated to assume a trimeric structure, similar to the tail fiber protein of phage t <dig>  <cit>  although there is no specific evidence for oligomerization in lambda.

in summary, it is surprising that we found so many virion protein interactions, given that virion assembly is an obligately ordered pathway and most binding sites may be only present in the growing virion and not on individual unassembled proteins.

transcription
the genetic switch leading to a decision between lysogeny and lysis has made lambda a prime model system for transcriptional regulation. a significant fraction of lambda literature has been devoted to this question  <cit> . here, we ignore the interactions of transcription factors with dna and concentrate on their interactions among each other and the transcriptional machinery. several factors form dimers . of these, we could only confirm the cii self-interaction. ci, cii, and ciii all interact with various components of the virion in our two-hybrid studies, especially of the tail. however, whether these interactions are physiologically relevant is questionable. notably, the antiterminators n and q also show a number of interactions in our tests although none of these involve any other transcriptional regulators. also, all of these interactions were found in a single vector combination, so they are not as well supported as other interactions.

recombination, integration, and excision
integration of the lambda genome into the host chromosome is part of the establishment of the lysogenic state. integrase , assisted by the integration host factor  catalyzes this reaction. similarly, integrase , this time assisted by excisionase  and the host fis protein, catalyzes the excision of the lambda prophage. three other lambda proteins are known to be involved in homologous recombination: exo , bet , gam , and ninb  protein  <cit> ). we did not find the known interaction between bet and exo. in fact, we found int and bet to both homodimerize, and bet and int to interact. this indicates that these proteins may assist int. a number of other interactions involving these recombination proteins and unrelated gene products are difficult to explain and require further analysis. however, they may implicate several uncharacterized small orfs in the process of recombination .

host interactions
at least  <dig> lambda proteins interact with host proteins . lambda critically depends on host factors for integration, transcription, excision and virion assembly. hence, a detailed understanding of lambda biology depends on information about such host-phage interactions. these interactions are beyond the scope of this study. we will address this issue in a forthcoming paper.

protein networks and functional genomics of phage lambda
phage lambda has been studied almost exclusively by detailed and directed functional studies for the past  <dig> years. systematic or large-scale studies have been initiated only recently. for instance, maynard et al.  <cit>  have screened the keio collection of e. coli deletion mutants for genes that affect lambda reproduction. this study found  <dig> e. coli genes of which more than half had not been associated with lambda biology before. similarly, osterhout et al.  <cit>  investigated e. coli gene expression as a result of prophage induction and found  <dig> genes to change their expression patterns when lambda lysogens are induced. we expect to finish our own screens of lambda-host interactions soon and integrate the resulting protein-protein interactions into a systems biology model of lambda biology.

CONCLUSIONS
using phage lambda as a benchmark we showed that we can find about 50% of the interactions among its proteins using y2h screens. no other technology has been able to detect such a large fraction of interactions in a single macromolecular assembly . we thus predict that our strategy can find roughly half of all interactions in other phage and protein complexes. however, other methods will be required to find interactions that require chaperones, post-translational modifications, or other additional factors that could not be provided in our assay.
