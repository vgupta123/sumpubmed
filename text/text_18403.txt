BACKGROUND
aphids are major agricultural pests which cause significant yield losses to crop plants each year by inflicting damage both through the direct effects of feeding and by vectoring debilitating plant viruses  <cit> . annual worldwide crop losses due to aphids are estimated at hundreds of millions of dollars  <cit> . the application of nitrogen fertilizer and elevation of atmospheric co <dig> concentration exacerbate aphid infestation  <cit> . the major aphid species infesting wheat in china are the grain aphid , greenbug , bird-cherry oat aphid  and rose-grain aphid . of these, grain aphid is the most dominant and destructive one, affecting most of the wheat production areas  <cit> . the grain aphid is also a major pest of wheat in europe and north america  <cit> . in some wheat production areas, it has damaging infestations every year, causing the wide-spread use of chemicals and as much as  <dig> to 60% of severe reduction in wheat yield  <cit> . due to the complexity of plant-aphid interactions and the rapid development of resistant pest biotypes, outbreak of aphids causing substantial losses of wheat are reported regularly  <cit> .

aphids are important agricultural pests and also biological models for study of insect-plant interactions, virus vectoring and host plant adaptation  <cit> . recently, the release of genome sequence of the pea aphid provided a foundation for post-genomic studies of fundamental biological questions both in pea aphid and other aphid species. it revealed the presence of more coding genes than in previously sequenced insects and in particular, the presence of genes with no orthologs in other insects  <cit> . now, the assembled genome sequence data, ests and full length cdnas of the pea aphid are accessible at the aphidbase web portal   <cit> . with the release of the first aphid genome and the general accessibility of next generation sequencing technologies, there is an expectation within the aphid research community that we have reached a tipping point for genome information from additional aphid species and high-resolution comparative genomic and evolutionary analyses  <cit> . although a close phylogenetic relationship between pea aphid and grain aphid was illustrated based on analysis of partial sequence of ef <dig> alpha orthologs in different aphid species  <cit> , the diversity between these two aphid species is obvious. for example, the host ranges of grain aphid are restricted to cereal crops and in particular wheat, that of pea aphid is wider, mainly colonizing many leguminous plant species. until now, the molecular mechanisms underlying their divergence and host adaptation have not been documented due to the lack of enough genetic data of grain aphid available in the public databases. in a previous study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of grain aphids before and after feeding on wheat plants by using illumina rna sequencing  <cit> . however, a complete transcriptome and/or genomic data of the grain aphid have not been documented so far, in spite of the fact that grain aphid is most dominant and destructive aphid pest affecting wheat production in china, europe and north america.

next-generation sequencing  technologies allow direct sequencing of cdna generated from messenger rna   <cit> . these new technologies enable the de novo reconstruction of the transcriptome for a non-model organism  <cit> , leading to novel opportunities for expression profiling of organisms lacking any genome or transcriptome sequence information  <cit> . in this paper, in order to reveal the genetic factors underlying the divergence between the grain and pea aphids, comparative analysis between the transcriptome data of grain aphid generated in our lab by roche  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing and mrna sequences of pea aphid available in the public databases was performed. a number of orthologous genes that showed signs of diversifying natural selection were identified. this comparative analysis provides an invaluable resource for the investigation of genes involved in plant infestation, host adaptation and insecticide resistance. moreover, the demonstration of divergent transcriptome sequences between grain aphid and pea aphid pave the way for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the biological variations of these two destructive aphid species.

RESULTS
roche  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing and assembly of grain aphid transcriptome
to obtain a global view of the grain aphid transcriptome,  <dig> grain aphids at different developmental stages, which were derived from a single clonal lineage, were used for rna isolation. high-throughput rna sequencing  was performed with roche  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing platform. a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads, with an average length of 380 bp, amounting to a total  <dig>  mb, were obtained and deposited in the ncbi short read archive  under the accession number: sra <dig>  the raw reads were assembled using mira  <dig> assembly software packages , and resulted in  <dig>  contigs with an average length of  <dig>  bp . the un-assembled high quality reads which occupied  <dig> %  of the total cleaned reads were added to the contigs dataset and generated in total of  <dig>  sequences. these sequences were further assembled with gsassembler v  <dig>  software. among  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  were identified as unique sequences, while the remaining  <dig>  sequences were re-assembled into  <dig>  contigs. after removing sequences below 100 bp and transcripts of buchnera aphidicola , we obtained  <dig>  distinct sequences as unigenes which included  <dig>  contigs and  <dig> singletons . the flow chart of data assembly was provided in the additional file  <dig>  the assembled transcriptome data were submitted and have been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gapl <dig>  the average coverage of the contigs was  <dig>  x , and the longest length and the average length of the assembled contigs were  <dig>  bp and 866 bp, respectively . next, we analyzed the length distribution of the contigs, singletons, unigenes and the number of reads per unigene. as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>  contigs  were longer than 1000 bp,  <dig>  contigs  ranged from 500 bp to 1000 bp, whereas  <dig> contigs  were below 500 bp . the n <dig> and n <dig> of the contigs, were  <dig>  and 479 bp, respectively . the un-assembled high quality reads were assigned as singletons, which occupied  <dig> %  of the total cleaned reads. the length of singletons varied from 100 bp to 600 bp with an average of 369 bp. the majority of singletons were between 200 bp and 600 bp in length, and  <dig> % of them were below 200 bp . the number of reads per unigene varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average of  <dig> . the group that consisted of less than  <dig> reads contained  <dig>  unigenes, representing  <dig> % of the total assembled unigenes. whereas  <dig> unigenes had more than  <dig> reads,  <dig> unigenes had  <dig> to  <dig> reads, and  <dig>  unigenes had  <dig> to  <dig> reads. unigenes with reads below  <dig> represented  <dig> %  of the total number of unigenes .table  <dig>

the a, t, c and g proportions of the assembled unigenes were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the gc content of the transcriptome data of grain aphid was  <dig> %, a value slightly higher than that of the pea aphid which was  <dig> %  <cit> . of these  <dig>  unigenes assembled, the average length of coding regions  was 556 bp and the gc content of the cdss was  <dig> %. among which,  <dig>  unigenes, of which gc content was  <dig> %, could be predicted with 3′utrs and the average length of the 3′utrs was  <dig>  bp. at the same time,  <dig>  unigenes were predicted with 5′utrs, of which gc content was  <dig> % and the average length of 5′utrs was  <dig>  bp. it was interesting to note that the gc contents among cdss, 5′utrs and 3′utrs were different and the cdss had highest gc content among these three categories, whereas the gc content of 5′utrs was  <dig> % higher than that of 3′utrs.

the functional annotation and classification of the assembled unigenes
functional annotations of the derived unigenes were performed using basic local alignment search tool  against the public available databases such as national center for biotechnology information  nucleotide acid database  and non-redundancy protein database , and blastx against the swiss-prot database. a total of  <dig>  unigenes  matched the nt database with an e value of 1e- <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes  matched genes in nr database with e value of 1e- <dig>  blastx against swiss-prot database indicated that  <dig>  unigenes  were annotated with an e-value of 1e- <dig> .table  <dig>

all unigenes that matched swiss-prot database entries were further classified by gene ontology  terms according to the number of the matched entries. in total,  <dig>  unigenes  had go terms . furthermore, the unigenes were also classified according to eukaryotic orthologous groups  terms. in total,  <dig>  unigenes  had kog terms . in addition,  <dig>  unigenes  were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways  and grouped into  <dig> categories. the majority of classifications were metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metablolites, which represented  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total annotated unigenes, respectively.

the transcriptomic divergences between grain aphid and pea aphid
comparisons of the transcriptome data of different aphid species would provide useful information in deciphering many of the specialized biological variations underlying the role of aphids as plant pests, and in understanding the transcriptome evolution and the genetic factors underlying the divergence of these species. to compare the sequence divergence of these two aphid species, we analyzed the possible orthologous genes between the transcriptome of grain aphid obtained in this study and the pea aphid mrna sequence data which are available in website  using bidirectional best hit which has been widely used to identify orthologous genes  <cit> .

first, blastn and tblastx tools were employed to screen out unigenes homologous to pea aphid. using blastn tool,  <dig>  unignes homologous to pea aphid mrna sequences were identified and  <dig>  sequences un-matched were further subjected to comparison with pea aphid mrna data at translation level. as sequences below 250 bp were too short to be translated or compared with the translated sequences from pea aphid mrna, they were removed from the  <dig>  sequences dataset, and finally  <dig>  sequences remained. furthermore, by using tblastx tool, we found that among  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  sequences were orthologous to pea aphid mrna sequences. for the remaining  <dig>  sequences,  <dig> were annotated with predicted functions similar to these of sequences from pea aphid in nt database. thus, among the  <dig>  unigenes assembled,  <dig>  unigenes  which occupied  <dig> % of total assembled unigenes showed homology to pea aphid mrna sequences. of these,  <dig>  were one-to-one orthologs,  <dig>  were tree-matched orthologs, and the remaining  <dig>  were either homologous to pea aphid mrna sequences with the ratio of matched region below 50% or some paralogs . during blastn analysis,  <dig> sequences which were shorter than 250 bp and had no homologous sequences with pea aphid mrna identified by blastn tool were excluded because they were too short for tblastx searching. the remaining  <dig>  unigenes  were identified to be grain aphid specific genes under the described rearing conditions in this study . the presence and expression of some of the grain aphid specific genes were confirmed by qrt-pcr with randomly selected  <dig> unigenes .figure  <dig> 
comparison of the assembled grain aphid unigenes with pea aphid mrna sequences. among the  <dig>  unigenes assembled,  <dig>  grain aphid unigenes  were homologous to pea aphid mrna sequences, of these,  <dig>  were one-to-one orthologs ,  <dig>  were tree-matched orthologs , and  <dig>  were homologous to pea aphid mrna sequences with the ratio of matched region below 50% and some paralogs . the number of unigenes which were unique to grain aphids compared with pea aphid mrna was  <dig>  . and the remaining  <dig> sequences  which were shorter than 250 bp and had no homologous sequences with pea aphid mrna identified by blastn tool were excluded because they were too short sequence for tblastx searching. all orthologs were identified using ete pipeline with sos of  <dig> .



furthermore, the nt, nr, swiss-prot annotations and kegg, kog and go classifications of  <dig>  grain aphid specific unigenes which had no homologous sequences with pea aphid were performed. as indicated in table  <dig>  less than 15% of these unigenes were predicted with a defined function, whereas the rest of them could not be annotated or classified in the current available public databases, indicating that the functions of these sequences remain unknown and need to be investigated or annotated in the future. in addition, the kegg classification result showed that among  <dig>  grain aphid specific unigenes,  <dig> unigenes was annotated with kegg terms which most of them were belonged to the groups of metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum , purine metabolism , oxidative phosphorylation , starch and sucrose metabolism , aminobenzoate degradation , naphthalene degradation , ploycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation , bisphenol degradation , chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene degradation  and so forth . given the differences of the host plants and the habitats of these two aphid species, we proposed that the above mentioned pathways might play an important role in biological variations and divergences between pea aphid and grain aphid.table  <dig>

the kegg pathway classifications of the grain aphid specific unigenes. among  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig> had been annotated with kegg terms, and the classification of these unigenes showed that many of them were categorized into the groups of metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum , purine metabolism , oxidative phosphorylation, , starch and sucrose metabolism , aminobenoate degradation , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation , bisphenol degradation , and others.



the sequence divergences of orthologs between grain and pea aphids
except for the identified distinct grain aphid and pea aphid specific sequences, the sequence divergences inside the orthologous gene pairs between grain aphid and pea aphids were also estimated. among  <dig>  unigenes homologous to pea aphid mrna sequences, in total  <dig>  sequences pairs were assigned as orthologs. for the  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs identified between grain aphid and pea aphid, the cds of each unigene was obtained by removing 5′ untranslated regions  and 3′ utrs sequence and aligned separately to its counterpart mrna sequence of pea aphid using a megablast algorithm to generate matched orthologous pairs. the errors caused in the orthologous pair alignment were checked and removed manually. then, the orthologous pairs below  <dig> base pairs were also removed in order to generate reasonable results. finally,  <dig>  pairs with cds larger than  <dig> base pairs obtained and subjected to kaks calculator analysis  <cit> , of these, only  <dig>  orthologous pairs could be calculated with non-synonymous , synonymous  and their substitution ratio .

the sequence divergences within  <dig>  orthologous pairs between the two aphid species, of which ratios ka/ks substitution could be calculated, had been assessed. for the 5′utr, the gc content was  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the compared nucleotides were in a cpg contexts . differences between 5′utrs of the analyzed orthologous genes of grain aphid and pea aphid occurred at  <dig> % of the positions. interestingly, cpg sites in the 5′utr differed at  <dig> % of positions, whereas non-cpg sites differed at  <dig> %. thus, within 5′utrs, differences occurred approximately  <dig> times more often at non-cpg sites than at cpg sites. for the 3′utr, the gc content was  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the nucleotides was in a cpg context. the overall difference of 3′utr between these two aphid species was  <dig> %. cpg and non-cpg sites differed at  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. hence, in the 3′utr, cpg sites contained more differences than non-cpg sites. to understand the mechanism of evolution, we compared the ratio of transition  and transversion   <cit> . overall, the transitional differences were more frequent than transversional differences in 5′utrs and 3′ utrs . interestingly, the ts/tv ratio was higher in the cpg positions  than the non-cpg positions  in both the 5′utrs and 3′ utrs. when comparing divergences of 3′utr and 5′utr, the cpg sites divergence of 3′utr  was higher than that of 5′utr ; however, the overall and non-cpg sites divergence of 5′utr  was higher than that of 3′utr  .table  <dig>

note: the total loci of orthologous gene pairs examined between these two aphid species is  <dig> 



among the  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs, the overall divergence in coding regions was  <dig> %. at non-cpg sites, the divergence was  <dig> %, whereas at the cpg sites, the divergence was  <dig> %. apart from cpg context, the nucleotide variations in coding regions could further be classified as non-degenerative  sites  and four fold degenerate  sites . from a total of  <dig> .66 kb of coding region sequences ,  <dig> .53 kb were nd sites, whereas  <dig>  kb were 4d sites . at nd sites, the overall divergence was  <dig> %, whereas the overall divergence at 4d sites was  <dig> %. at nd sites, the gc content was  <dig> % and the cpg content was  <dig> %. among the divergence happened at nd sites, the non-cpg sites divergence between two aphid species was  <dig> % and the divergence at cpg sites was  <dig> %. at the 4d sites, the gc content was  <dig> % and the cpg content was  <dig> %. among the divergence happened at 4d sites, the divergence was  <dig> % at cpg sites while it was  <dig> % at non-cpg sites. these results demonstrated that the higher percentage of divergence at 4d sites compared with nd site was probably proportional to the content of cpg sites  and the rate of mutation . comparison the transition and transvertion ratio of nd sites and 4d sites indicated that the transvertional differences were more frequent at nd sites than at 4d sites .

furthermore, the code usages of these  <dig>  orthologous pairs between two aphid species were also analyzed by using cusp software . the gc content of the orthologous cdss in grain aphid was  <dig> % and that in pea aphid was  <dig> %. the gc contents in the first, the second and the third base of triplet-codes in grain aphid were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. however, for its counterpart, pea aphid, these values were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %. it was interesting to note that the first base of triplet-codes in both aphid species had highest frequency of g/c usage  followed by second base and then the third base.

estimation of the substitution rates based on synonymous and non-synonymous analysis between grain aphid and pea aphid
ka/ks have been widely used to measure the intensity and mode of selection. ka/ks >  <dig> is interpreted as a sign of positive selection whereas ka/ks <  <dig> is a sign of purifying selection  <cit> . to identify genes undergoing positive and purifying selection, ka and ks substitution rates of orthologous pairs between grain and pea aphids were estimated. these  <dig>  orthologous gene pairs had mean values of ka, ks, and ka/ks of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. of these  <dig>  sequence pairs,  <dig> orthologous gene pairs had ka/ks values larger than  <dig>  had ka/ks values between  <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> had ka/ks values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and the rest  <dig>  had ka/ks values below  <dig>  . the distribution of ka and ks was as shown in figure  <dig> and the top  <dig> orthologs which had values of ka/ks >  <dig> was as listed in table  <dig> figure  <dig>

in addition, of the  <dig>  orthologous pairs,  <dig>  could be annotated with kegg terms. according to ka/ks values, these  <dig>  orthologs could be classified into two groups, which consisted of  <dig> in one group that had ka/ks >  <dig> and  <dig>  in another group had ka/ks <  <dig>  the kegg classification of two groups which had ka/ks values < <dig> and > <dig> had similar distribution patterns . to identify the kegg pathways which had more unigenes with ka/ks value larger than  <dig>  we compared the kegg classifications of the two groups. the pathways such as secondary metabolisms , detoxification , nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain -like receptor signaling pathway and so on had high percentage of unigenes with value of ka/ks > <dig> . given the fact that similar pathways involved were identified with the grain aphid specific unigenes , we proposed that these pathways might be subjected to positive selection pressure during the process of evolution and play an important role in biological variations and divergences of these two aphid species. for example, a cytochrome p <dig> 6a2-like protein , which is predicted to take part in enhancing resistance to insecticide  <cit> , had a ka/ks value larger than  <dig> . the differences in partial dna and amino acid sequences of a cytochrome p <dig> 6a2-like protein ortholog between grain aphid  and pea aphid  were as indicated in figure  <dig>  sequence alignments indicated that among the  <dig> nucleoid acid mutations detected,  <dig> were nonsynonymous substitutions leading to amino acid changes. further ka/ks analysis with sliding window length of 57 bp and a step length of 6 bp indicated that a locus where a nucleoid acid change of gaa to aaa which led to an amino acid change of e to k might be under positive selection during evolution . this evidence further indicated that this cytochrome p <dig> 6a2-like protein gene might be under strong positive selection during the evolution of the grain aphid with the observed nucleotide acids or amino acid residues subjected to these variations underlying biological divergence or host plants specialization.figure  <dig>

discussion
natural selection under different ecological and agricultural environments might be the main cause of evolution and divergence among aphid species, and resulted in their biological and host plants differences. following publication of the first pea aphid genome in february  <dig>  aphid biology is entering a new era focused on deciphering many of the specialized biological adaptations underlying the role of aphids as plant pests  <cit> . so far, only a few genes, such as mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit i , were used to study the differentiation and divergences among different populations of one or different aphid species  <cit> . however, the investigation of individual gene may not provide an accurate insight into the divergence underlying the biological variations and host plant adaptation of the diverse aphid species at a genome-wide scale. genome information for additional aphid species needs to be obtained to perform the high-resolution comparative genomic and evolutionary analyses  <cit> . comparison between complete genome sequence of pea aphid  and expressed sequence tag  data from three other species, green peach-potato aphid , cotton aphid  and toxoptera citricida suggested that a number of the genes evolved fast , including many genes shared by aphids but with no hit in universal proteins   <cit> . furthermore, comparisons of the genome sequence of pea aphid with ests of  <dig> other aphid species were also performed to verify whether the accumulation of deleterious mutations is the reason for loss of sexual reproduction  <cit> . yet, no similar works on grain aphid or the transcriptome data of grain aphid were documented so far.

a more robust picture of genomic divergence among these major agricultural important aphid species may be obtained by examining the transcriptome that have been selected in an unbiased way without prior interest in their biological functions or evolutionary histories  <cit> . although the transcriptome data depend on the environment of aphids sampled as well as how the genotype has evolved, the transcriptome represents a sample of the spatiotemporally-expressed genome and can be used as an entry into the genome divergence analysis  <cit> . in this study, we analyzed the divergence of transcriptome sequence between the two aphid species, and similar genes/pathways were identified to be involved in the divergence of two aphid species through both comparative transcriptomic analysis and ka/ks analysis. comparing with mrna sequences of pea aphid,  <dig>  unigenes were regarded to be specifically expressed in grain aphid under the described rearing conditions , among which could be annotated by kegg terms, most of them were involved in secondary metabolism pathways, amino acid metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism and detoxification or insecticide resistance . in addition, to estimate the extent to which selection affects protein-coding sequences, the ratios of ka/ks were estimated. ka/ks ratio is a good indicator of selective pressure and has been used to identify protein coding sequences under positive and purifying selection  <cit> . ka/ks analysis between grain aphid and pea aphid showed that  <dig> orthologs were identified to have ka/ks >  <dig>  which was interpreted as a sign of positive selection. many of these genes were involved in kegg pathways such as amino acid biosynthesis and other biomolecular synthesis and metabolism, polysaccharide metabolism, insecticide resistance and detoxification, and nod-like receptor signaling pathway . given that similar involved pathways were identified with the grain aphid specific unigenes, such as secondary metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism and amino metabolism, detoxification and insecticide resistance, these lines of evidences suggested that the above mentioned biological processes and/or pathways were under strongly positive selection and might play important roles in divergence of biological variation and host plants adaptation during the aphid evolution. similar processes were also identified to be involved in the divergence between two invasive whitefly cryptic species  <cit> .

in addition, a number of divergent sequences within the orthologous gene pairs might also contribute to the biological differences between the two aphid species. the gene divergence at the 5′utr  was more obvious than that of cds  and 3′utr regions . the ratio of ts/tv can indicate the mechanism of evolution  <cit> . the frequencies of ts were higher than that of tv both in 5′utr and 3′ utr region. however, in the coding region, this frequency was slightly lower . this result further indicated that the sequence divergences of these two aphid species in un-coding regions of orthologous gene pairs were mainly caused by transitional difference whereas that of the coding regions was mainly due to the transversional variations, especially at the nd sites in which the change of every base of codon would cause the variation of amino acid sequence.

although the transcriptome of grain aphid generated in our lab and used in this study might have biases due to the fact that the presence of the transcriptome profile depends on the conditions under which aphids were reared and the different developmental stages of aphids, it did not indeed affect the grain aphid specific sequences and orthologous pairs identified by ete software using a species overlap score  of  <dig>  because of the following reasons. firstly, we used aphids of mixed life stages to make the library in order to maximize the likelihood of having a whole set of transcripts under the described rearing condition in this study. secondly, analysis of the transcriptomic divergence under the same rearing conditions such as in an artificial diet assay may also not appropriate because some genes involved in host plants localization and aphid-plant interaction may not expressed at all. at last, the generated transcriptome was assembled by using the genome sequences of pea aphid as a reference set. based on this, grain aphid specific sequences and sequence divergences between the orthologous pairs of these aphid species was analyzed and divergences in the orthologous pairs in the coding, 5′utr and 3′ utr regions were explored with ete with sos of  <dig> . ete algorithm uses the level of species overlap between the two branches of a given node to define a duplication  or a speciation  and this has been successfully applied in comparison of gene repertoires and patterns of evolutionary rates in eight aphid species that differ by reproductive mode  <cit> . and then  <dig> orthologs which were predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism, xenobiotic metabolisms and etc. were identified to have evolved in response to positive selection based on ka and ks analyses. however, we can’t expect to solve all the problems with one single silver bullet, the revealed genetic divergence between grain aphid and pea aphid remains to be appropriately interpreted in light of their biological studies in the near future.

nevertheless, despite the high sequence homology between grain aphid and pea aphid and its closer relationship, both the transcriptome divergences and the ka/ks analyses demonstrated that grain aphid and pea aphid have diverged substantially. and pathways such as the amino acids and other biomolecular synthesis and metabolism, polysaccharide and saccharide metabolism, insecticide resistance and detoxification, might have been subjected to strongly positive selection and play important roles in biological divergences of these two agriculturally important aphid species.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis between this set of transcriptome of grain aphid generated in our lab by roche  <dig> gs-flx pyrosequencing and mrna sequences of pea aphid available in the public databases revealed both grain aphid specific sequences and divergent orthologous sequences. and a couple of orthologous genes and/or pathways were identified to have evolved under positive selection pressure which might play important roles in the divergences of grain aphid and pea aphid. to our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study the transcriptome divergence of these two agriculturally important pest species. our results will provide valuable resources for post-genomic studies of fundamental biological questions in both grain and pea aphids, and investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution and divergence of these two destructive aphid species.
