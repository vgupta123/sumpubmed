BACKGROUND
the cognitive deficits in patients with alzheimer’s disease  and fronto-temporal lobar degeneration  are associated with selective loss of neuronal populations in the neocortex, limbic system and subcortical nuclei, in association with progressive accumulation of the cytoskeletal protein tau . ftld is an heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders that are characterised by atrophy of the frontal and/or temporal lobes  <cit> . examples of ftld include pick’s disease  and corticobasal degeneration. in contrast to ad, which presents predominantly with memory loss, ftld is associated with changes in personal and social conduct, behaviour and language disturbances, and often motor symptoms  <cit> . in ftld neurodegeneration is associated with either aggregated tau or aggregated tar dna-binding protein of 43 kda , fused-in-sarcoma or yet unidentified proteins in affected brain regions in the absence of overt beta-amyloid  plaques  <cit> .

the mechanisms through which aggregated and hyperphosphorylated tau leads to neurodegeneration in ad and ftld are not completely clear. recent studies suggest that abnormal tau might mediate neurodegeneration by dysregulating dynamin-related protein- <dig> , which in turns results in alterations in mitochondria biogenesis  <cit> . moreover, tau phosphorylation at ser <dig> through par- <dig> contributes to tau-mediated neurodegeneration under a pathological condition in which axonal mitochondria are depleted  <cit> . thus tau dependent loss of axonal mitochondria may play an important role in the toxicity and pathogenesis of ad  <cit> . tau also mediates the neurotoxic effects of aβ which can promote the mis-localization of tau to the dendrites  <cit>  and mitochondria  <cit> . in contrast, tau reduction has been shown to ameliorate the behavioral and neurodegenerative pathology in models of ad  <cit> . therefore strategies directed at reducing tau accumulation might be protective for ad and ftld.

we have previously shown that in app transgenic  mice over expressing the amyloid precursor protein , cbl reduces synaptic and behavioral deficits . cbl is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic-like effects that improves cognition in patients with mild to moderate ad . moreover, a recent double-blind trial of cbl was demonstrated to improve the activities of daily living and psychiatric deficits in patients with moderate to moderately severe ad  <cit> . several other randomized double-blind studies in patients with ad have shown that cbl is consistently superior to placebo at reducing cognitive alterations .

cbl also ameliorates the neurodegenerative pathology and accumulation of tau in a combined app tg mouse model injected with aav2-tau  <cit> . we have recently shown that cbl might reduce app and tau pathology in models of ad by decreasing cdk <dig> and gsk3β activity  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether cbl might ameliorate the neurodegenerative pathology in models of ftld. for this purpose we generated a new cross of the mutant tau tg mice expressing human  <dig> repeat tau , bearing the missense mutations v337m and r406w, under the mthy- <dig> promoter  <cit>  with gsk3β tg mice. the tau/gsk3β double tg model displays biochemical and neuropathological features reminiscent of tauopathies including elevated levels of tau phosphorylation and neurodegeneration. we found that administration of cbl reduces the levels of tau and ameliorates the neurodegeneration in this tau/gsk3β double tg model and this is accompained by reduced levels of drp- <dig> and mitochondrial pathology associated with tau.

RESULTS
neuropathological and biochemical alterations in tau/gsk3β tg mice
the parental single tau mutant tg mice that we use have been reported to display moderate alterations in tau accumulation  <cit> , additionally, previous studies have shown that adding gsk3β enhances the pathology  <cit> , therefore tau/gsk3β bigenic mice were generated by crossing tau tg mice expressing human tau under the mthy- <dig> promoter with gsk3β tg mice in order to enhance tau phosphorylation. these double tg mice were subsequently used to evaluate the effects of cbl. immunochemical analysis was performed in order to compare the expression patterns and distribution of tau and gsk3β between the single tau tg and the tau/gsk3β tg mice. by western blot levels of total gsk3β  were  <dig> fold higher in the gsk3β and tau/gsk3β tg compared to non-tg and tau tg mice . likewise, levels of phosphorylated gsk3β  were 3-fold higher in the gsk3β and tau/gsk3β tg compared to non-tg and tau tg mice . gsk3β was phosphorylated at the t-loop tyrosine y <dig> which could play a role in forcing open the substrate-binding site and has been proposed to correlate with kinase activation. levels of total-tau  were 2– <dig> fold higher in the tau tg and the tau/gsk3β tg mice compared to non-tg and gsk3β tg . levels of phosphorylated tau  were increased by 40% in the gsk3β tg, by 200% in the tau tg and by 350% in the tau/gsk3β tg compared to non-tg . the levels of p-tau were significantly different between the tau tg and the tau/gsk3β tg. immunocytochemical analysis showed that in the gsk3β tg and tau/gsk3β tg mice levels of gsk3β immunoreactivity were higher in the pyramidal cell in neocortex, ca1-ca <dig> and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus , as well as in neurons in the basal ganglia and brain-stem , compared to the non-tg controls and tau tg mice. these same neuronal populations also displayed increased p-tau immunoreactivity in the neocortex and granular cells in the hippocampus with the at <dig> antibody . the levels of p-tau were significantly higher in the tau/gsk3β tg compared to the tau tg mice .

to further investigate the effects of age on tau pathology in the single and bigenic mice, immunocytochemical analysis with p-tau  antibody was performed in mice at  <dig>   <dig> and 12 months of age. the non-tg and gsk3β tg mice display low levels of p-tau immunoreactivity at the  <dig> time points . compared to the control, the tau tg mice displayed a mild increase in p-tau at 6 m and 12 m of age . the tau/gsk3β tg displayed a mild increase in p-tau at 3 m and a robust progressive increase in p-tau at 6 m and 12 m of age . tau/gsk3β tg mice displayed greater p-tau compared to single tau tg mice therefore for subsequent studies with cbl we compared the effects on non-tg vs bigenic mice.figure  <dig>

chronic treatment with cbl reduces tau phosphorylation in the bigenic mice
non-tg and bigenic mice were treated for 3 months  with cbl and brains were analyzed with p-tau antibodies. mice were 6 month old at the time of the analysis. by immunoblot, levels of t-tau were elevated in the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice compared to the non-tg, no effects of cbl administration on t-tau were observed . likewise levels of p-tau species as detected with the at <dig> and at <dig> antibodies were increased in the tau/gsk3β tg compared to non-tg, however in tau/gsk3β tg mice treated with cbl, the levels of p-tau were reduced by 50% compared to the vehicle-treated tau/gsk3β tg group .

immunohistochemical analysis showed that p-tau immunoreactivity was more prominent in the hippocampal ca <dig> and dentate gyrus  regions of the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice compared to non-tg controls . tau/gsk3β tg mice treated with cbl displayed a 40% decrease in the levels of p-tau immunostaining in the hippocampus compared to the tau/gsk3β tg vehicle group .figure  <dig>

neuroprotective effects of cbl in the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice
next we evaluated whether the effects of cbl in the bigenic mice ameliorated the neurotoxic effects of p-tau. for this purpose vibratome sections were immunolabeled with antibodies against the dendritic marker- map <dig> and the pan-neuronal marker- neun. vehicle-treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice displayed a significant 25-30% reduction in map <dig> immunoreactivity in the ca <dig> region and the dg molecular layer compared to the vehicle treated non-tg controls . in contrast, bigenic mice treated with cbl showed levels of map <dig> immunoreactivity comparable to non-tg controls . stereological analysis of neuronal cell density with neun showed that the vehicle treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice displayed a significant 35-40% reduction in neun immunoreactivity cells in the ca <dig> region and the dg granular cell layer compared to the vehicle treated non-tg controls . treatment with cbl ameliorated loss of neun positive cells in the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice, which showed cell counts comparable to those observed in the non-tg controls .figure  <dig>

treatment with cbl reverses alterations in drp- <dig> in tau/gsk3β bigenic mice
previous studies have shown that tau neurotoxicity might be mediated by alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> , in this context we examined the levels of drp- <dig> a protein involved in mitochondrial fission and the general mitochondrial marker tom <dig>  <cit>  in the bigenic mice. by immunoblot analysis, drp- <dig> was identified as a single band at approximately 80 kda . compared to the vehicle treated non-tg controls, the vehicle treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice displayed a significant 35-40% increase in drp- <dig> in the cytosolic fraction from hippocampal homogenates . in contrast, bigenic mice treated with cbl showed levels of drp- <dig> lower than those detected in the vehicle treated bigenic mice. moreover, levels of drp- <dig> in the cbl-treated bigenic mice were slightly below the levels of the non-tg controls . level of phosphorylated drp- <dig>  were higher in the vehicle-treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice in comparison to vehicle- and cbl-treated non-tg mice . cbl treatment significantly decreased expression of p-ddrp- <dig> in the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice, bringing it to levels more comparable with non-tg controls .

immunocytochemical analysis showed that drp- <dig> reactivity was abundant in the neuropil of the cortex. likewise, tom <dig> immunoreactivity was most abundant in the neuropil displaying a fine punctate pattern . compared to the vehicle treated non-tg controls, the vehicle treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice displayed a significant 30-35% increase in drp- <dig> and tom <dig> immunoreactivity, while the bigenic mice treated with cbl showed levels of drp- <dig> and tom <dig> similar those observed in the non-tg controls .figure  <dig>

cbl ameliorates the mitochondrial alterations in tau/gsk3β bigenic mice
given that the neurodegenerative pathology in the tau/gsk3β bigenic mice was concomitant with an increase in drp- <dig>  and p-drp- <dig>  expression and tom <dig> puncta, we next sought to determine whether these alterations correspond to mitochondrial alterations. for this purpose electron microscopic analysis was performed in hippocampal sections. remarkably, compared to the vehicle and cbl-treated non-tg mice , the vehicle-treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice showed extensive mitochondrial alterations including presence of lamellar intra-mitochondrial inclusions, incompletely divided and fragmented mitochondria . in contrast, the mitochondria from the cbl treated bigenic mice were similar to controls . consistent with these observations, image analysis showed that in the vehicle treated tau/gsk3β bigenic mice the proportion of small , dividing mitochondria with inclusions was greater when compared to the non-tg controls, while bigenic mice treated with cbl displayed mitochondrial characteristics similar to non-tg controls .figure  <dig>

discussion
the present study showed that the tau/gsk3β double tg model displays biochemical and neuropathological features reminiscent of tauopathies such as elevated levels of tau phosphorylation and hippocampal neurodegeneration. interestingly, the tau/gsk3β double-tg mice also display elevated levels of drp- <dig>  p-drp- <dig>  and increased fragmentation of mitochondria accompanied by abnormal divisions and membranous inclusions. in the bigenic mice, cbl treatment reduced the accumulation of p-tau, ameliorated the neurodegenerative pathology, decreased drp- <dig> and p-drp- <dig> expression, and returned mitochondria to characteristics comparable to non-tg mice.

the mthy1-tau  tg model has been shown to accumulate soluble p-tau in the limbic system and to display spatial learning impairments  <cit> . the ftdp- <dig> r406w tau mutation has been described in an american, a dutch, and a japanese family . to enhance these deficits we crossed these animals with an mthy1-gsk3β tg model. this resulted in more widespread accumulation of p-tau and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. the alterations in the tau/gsk3β double tg model are comparable to previous reports using a tg model with conditional overexpression of gsk3β in forebrain neurons  <cit> .

given the findings with the age dependent analysis showing that p-tau accumulation is more abundant in tau/gsk3β double tg compared to the single tg mice, we decided to test the effects of cbl in the bigenic mice. animals were treated beginning at 3 months of age for 3 months, because at the earlier age group the tau pathology was subtler, becoming progressively worse at  <dig> and 12 months of age. therefore, the effects described in our study represent a preventive trial study for cbl. future study will be needed testing the effects of cerebrolysin in older tau/gsk3β double tg compared to single tau tg mice. moreover, future studies in other models of tauopathy such as the tg <dig> are warranted to further validate our observations.

an additional novel finding of our model was the presence of widespread mitochondrial pathology and increased drp- <dig> expression. this is consistent with recent studies showing that accumulation of tau might lead to neurodegeneration via alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis . drp- <dig> is known to promote mitochondrial fission, consistent with this our ultra-structural studies showed increased in fragmented mitochondria with abnormal divisions and inclusions. remarkably, hyperactivation of kinases that phosphorylate tau such as cdk <dig> and gsk3β has been shown to interfere with drp- <dig> function leading to mitochondrial alterations  <cit> , and gsk3β has been reported to phosphorylate drp- <dig>  <cit> . in these bigenic mice, treatment with cbl ameliorated the neurodegenerative pathology, decreased p-tau, reduced drp- <dig> and normalized mitochondrial morphology. the mechanisms through which cbl might achieve these effects on the bigenic model are not completely clear. we have previously shown that this neurotrophic peptide mixture is capable of reducing the behavioral deficits in app tg mouse model of ad-like pathology  <cit>  by blocking cdk <dig> and gsk3β  <cit> , resulting in decreased app maturation and aβ biosynthesis  <cit> , increased neurogenesis  <cit>  and synaptic formation  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that the effects on drp- <dig> observed in the bigenic mice might be partially mediated by the inhibitory effects of cbl on cdk <dig> and gsk3β  <cit> . moreover, and consistent, with the present study, treatment with cbl in app tg injected with aav2-tau has been reported to result in a significant amelioration of neurodegenerative pathology and decreased levels of tau phosphorylation at critical sites dependent on gsk3β and cdk <dig> activity  <cit> . these results suggest that cbl administration may have some therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of tauopathies.

CONCLUSIONS
in the tau/gsk3β double tg model cbl may rescue the deficits by reducing tau hyperphosphorylation, which in turn may restore mitochondrial biogenesis. these results suggest that cbl’s ability to rescue neurodegenerative pathology in the tauopathy model may involve reducing accumulation of hyper-phosphorylated tau and then restoring altered mitochondrial biogenesis associated with tau. therefore, cbl might be of potential therapeutical value in the treatment of certain forms of ftld.
