BACKGROUND
pine wilt disease  is one of the most serious global conifer diseases affecting native species of pinus from the far east forestlands to some parts of europe  <cit> . the pine wood nematode  bursaphelenchus xylophilus is the causal agent of pwd. pwn kills infected trees usually within a year of infection. this nematode is believed to be native to north america and causes little damage to the pinus species in those regions. however, once introduced into a susceptible tree area, prevention of the spread of b. xylophilus becomes increasingly difficult because the nematode is vectored by the adult  stage of monochamus beetles  <cit> .

bursaphelenchus xylophilus is thought to have been introduced into japan approximately 100 years ago from north america  <cit> . the first description of pwd in the nagasaki prefecture in japan occurred in  <dig>  <cit> , although b. xylophilus was not identified as the causal agent of the disease until  <dig>  <cit> . pwd has since spread to other east asian countries, such as china taiwan, and korea in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . moreover, pwd was found in portugal in  <dig>  <cit>  and has now spread to spain  <cit> .

over the past two decades, several molecular techniques have been applied to assess the genetic variability of b. xylophilus with the aim of revealing the origins and patterns of spread of this pathogenic nematode . some of these reports suggested that isolates from non-native areas  exhibited less genetic diversity than those from the native area   <cit> . however, a significant degree of genetic diversity or even greater genetic diversity than native isolates was also observed in non-native isolates  <cit> . therefore, it remains inconclusive regarding the genetic diversity of pwn from those studies, which demands a genome-wide analysis to have a full picture of this nematode diversity.

the genome of b. xylophilus was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and permit the investigation of population structures by genome-wide analyses and the identification of genetic factors involved in its key biological processes and parasitism. the genetic diversity of b. xylophilus isolates from different geographic locations was recently assessed using single nucleotide polymorphisms  from transcriptome data  <cit> . however, the genome-wide variations between the populations of b. xylophilus remains unknown, which presumed to have different geographical origins and possess different phenotypic characteristics such as degree of pathogenicity  and reproductive ability on fungi. identification of such variations will shed light on the molecular mechanism of b. xylophilus pathogenicity, as well as clarify the complex evolutionary and epidemic history of this nematode.

during the history of pwd in japan, a number of b. xylophilus strains have been isolated from the natural environment. extensive studies were performed on these strains of b. xylophilus to assess their pathogenic characteristics and ecological traits . increasing phenotypic information concerning the isolates of b. xylophilus in japan encouraged us to explore the intra-species genomic variation of this nematode.

in this study, we selected and sequenced six representative strains isolated in japan that were used widely in previous studies . we have shown that between strains of b. xylophilus genomes exhibit high genetic diversity, indicating multiple origins of b. xylophilus populations in japan. to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first genome-wide attempt to estimate the variation in b. xylophilus populations.table  <dig> origin and ecological traits of b. xylophilus strains used in this study

RESULTS
inter-strain genomic variation in bursaphelenchus xylophilus
in order to investigate the genomic diversity of b. xylophilus, we re-sequenced six representative strains with different phenotypic or ecological traits . the genome of b. xylophilus was revealed to be highly variable between the strains studied. we detected  <dig> , <dig> variant positions, which accounted for  <dig>  % of the total genome . most of the variants were snps , and a smaller number of positions had small indels, comprising  <dig>  and  <dig>  positions with insertions or deletions of 2–16 bp, respectively. of these indels,  <dig>  could be possible errors, as they were located adjacent to homopolymer regions longer than 5 bp.table  <dig> statistics of the variants found in b. xylophilus strains

all variant numbers were from comparisons to the reference genome



the snps and indels identified were validated by polymerase chain reaction , followed by sanger sequencing. a selected set of  <dig> variants  was used for the experimental validation. all snps and small indels were validated by the experiment, excluding one position with a homo/hetero difference, suggesting that our variance predictions were highly accurate .

a maximum parsimony tree was generated based on  <dig> , <dig> genomic positions with snp variants. the tree displayed good support for all samples studied . the samples were divided into two major groups, one comprising c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig> and the other comprising the remaining four samples including the reference strain ka4c <dig>  an extremely close relationship was observed between s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig>  consistent with the fact that these were inbred lines derived from the same parents, whereas t <dig> was positioned distinctly from them. more than  <dig>  million variants were detected in c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig> compared with the reference genome; whereas, smaller, but still high, numbers of variants  were observed for the other three strains . most of the variants  identified were homozygotes  in each strain . in the three strains that had undergone inbreeding ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the variants were homozygous, respectively. in the two isolates that did not experience inbreeding ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively, of the variants were homozygous.fig.  <dig> a maximum parsimony tree from single nucleotide polymorphisms  using paup*4b <dig> with  <dig> bootstrap resampling replicates . the scale bar represents the number of homologous substitutions.  and  after strain names indicate high virulence and low virulence, respectively



comparisons of variant positions with the reference gene models revealed that  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the variations were located in intergenic and intronic regions, respectively, representing higher frequencies than the ratios of the individual nucleotides in the total genome . exonic, upstream/downstream and splicing regions had fewer variants compared with the ratios of the individual nucleotides in the total genome . among the exonic variants, there were  <dig>  synonymous and  <dig>  non-synonymous snps. there were fewer indels that could introduce frameshifts  . there were  <dig>  stop gain and  <dig> stop loss variants . distribution patterns of variants and possible effects were similar between the strains .fig.  <dig> 
a variant position percentages across sequence classes. the annovar program was used to classify variant positions. intergenic: variant is in the intergenic region, not included in upstream or downstream, intronic: variant overlaps an intron, exonic: variant overlaps a coding region, upstream: variant overlaps 1-kb region upstream of the transcription start site, downstream: variant overlaps 1-kb region downstream of the transcription end site, splicing: variant is within 2 bp of a splicing junction. the absolute numbers of variants were shown above the bars. genome percentages of the same classes are shown alongside. b effects of the exonic variants. synonymous : a single nucleotide change that does not cause an amino acid change, non synonymous : a single nucleotide change that causes an amino acid change, frameshift insertion/deletion: an insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides that cause frameshift changes to proteins, stop gain/loss: a nonsynonymous snp or indel that leads to the immediate creation/elimination of a stop codon at the variant site, frameshift substitution: a block substitution  of one or more nucleotides that cause frameshift changes, unknown: unknown function . each position can have more than one alternative variant and the effect could be different



investigation of the number of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions provides information about the degree of selection during the evolution of a particular population. to determine the genetic diversity in coding regions, we calculated the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site  as well as the number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site . we found a mean synonymous site diversity μsi =  <dig>  × 10− <dig> and a mean non-synonymous site diversity μns =  <dig>  × 10− <dig>  the resulting value of pn/ps of  <dig>  suggested that strong purifying selection acting on the coding regions of these nematodes. the pair-wise comparisons illustrated that pn/ps ratios varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an exceptionally high value  obtained from the comparison between s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> . as observed in pristionchus pacificus  <cit> , a lower pn/ps ratio was observed in across-clade comparisons  than in within-clade comparisons. however, the pn/ps ratio of the intra-clade comparison between c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig> deviated strongly from this observation.fig.  <dig> relationship of the pn/ps ratio and synonymous site diversity  of all pair-wise comparisons of six b. xylophilus strains



frameshift and stop codon variants
genomic variants that introduce frameshift or stop codon mutations can have serious effects on protein structures and functions. the results of a functional enrichment test for frameshift and stop codon variants are shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  respectively. for the frameshift variants, six and five gene ontology  terms were significantly enriched in c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig>  respectively, whereas only two go terms were enriched in the other three strains . several go terms were related to proteolysis and peptidase inhibitor activity. metallopeptidase activity was over-represented in three strains , aspartic-type endopeptidase activity was over-represented in two strains  and cysteine-type endopeptidases inhibitor activity was over-represented in four strains . hydrolase activity acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds  and cadmium ion transmembrane transporter activity were each over-represented in one strain . in addition, voltage-gated chloride channel activity was over-represented in three strains .

similarly to the frameshift variants, for the stop codon variants, more over-represented pathways were found in okd1-f <dig>  and c14- <dig>  than in s10-p <dig> , s10-p <dig>  and t <dig> . metallopeptidase activity and alpha-trehalase activity were over-represented in okd1-f <dig> and c14- <dig>  flavin mononucleotide binding was over-represented in t <dig>  s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> . acetylcholine-activated, cation-selective channel activity and dopamine beta monooxygenase activity were over-represented in s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> .

de novo assemblies using un-mapped reads
unmapped reads of each sample were assembled independently from the reference. filtering by length  and by overlapping ends  with the reference genome was applied to avoid any contaminating sequences, as described previously  <cit> . the total lengths of the assemblies were similar between the strains, varying from  <dig>   to  <dig>  bp  . the numbers of contigs generated ranged 491– <dig>  with the highest number identified for s10-p <dig> and the lowest found for t <dig> .

protein-coding genes were predicted on the assemblies using augustus, with parameters optimised for b. xylophilus  <cit> . the numbers of predicted genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . some genes were unique  to each sample and the reference gene models, with the highest number and proportion in c14- <dig>  and the lowest number and proportion in s10-p <dig>  . several genes were found in more than one sample . annotations of those genes, based on blast2go software, are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  three proteins in s10-p <dig> were not found in s10-p <dig>  and  <dig> proteins in s10-p <dig> were not found in s10-p <dig>  two and four of these proteins were unique in strains s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig>  respectively. blast2go analysis of the protein sequences that differed between s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> are shown in table  <dig>  two proteins have signal peptides for secretion, whereas the other two have transmembrane domains. the unique genes in s10-p <dig> are related to the transferase activity of acyl groups , helicase activity or binding activities. the unique genes in s10-p <dig> are related to n-acetyltransferase activity, cysteine-type peptidase activity and transport.fig.  <dig> venn diagram showing the number of unique and overlapping genes predicted in the un-mapped de-novo assemblies between the strains

identification of copy number variations 
cnvs represent a form of structural variation corresponding to relatively large regions of the genome that have been deleted  or duplicated  on certain chromosomes. in addition to identifying snps and small indels, we also investigated cnvs to determine whether there were large missing or duplicated parts in the b. xylophilus genomes. compared with the reference genome,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the genomes of c14- <dig>  okd1-f <dig>  t <dig>  s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig>  respectively, have large insertions or deletions ranging in size from 1–31 kb .

variants specific to low-virulence strains
isolate c14- <dig> and okd <dig> are relatively closely related  <cit> , and they share similar characteristics with each other, including low virulence to the host and a slower life cycle . our phylogenetic analysis based on whole snp positions confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other and distantly related to the other strains . these two strains shared  <dig> , <dig> common variants compared with the reference genome, which accounted for more than half of the total variants in each strain. most of the shared variants  were homozygotic, and  <dig>   were exonic. those exonic variants caused frameshift deletion/insertion  and stop codon mutations . homozygotic variations affected  <dig> genes as frameshift variants,  <dig> genes as stop codon variants and  <dig>  genes as non-synonymous variants. metalloendopeptidase activity and peptide-transporting atpase activity were also enriched among these frameshift changes , and the structural constituent of muscle and endopeptidase activity were over-represented in the stop codon changes .

comparison between two inbred lines from the same parents
of particular interest, strains s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> were compared to identify genes related to differences in pathogenicity  because these inbred lines originated from the same parent pair  <cit> . this comparison revealed that only  <dig>  genomic positions were different between the two inbred lines, which accounted for  <dig>  % of the genome. among them, only  <dig> variants  were homozygotic . the number of exonic variants between the two lines was only  <dig>  consisting primarily of synonymous and non-synonymous snps, accounting for  <dig> and  <dig> variants, respectively. there were  <dig> frameshift variants , in which only three positions were homozygotic . functional annotation of these genes suggested their involvement in transport, protein phosphatase activity and phosphorylation activity . all stop codon variations were heterozygous between the two lines. homozygotic non-synonymous snps that differed between s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> were predicted to affect the functions of five genes  based on analysis using the sift algorithm  <cit>  and align gvgd  <cit> . in particular, bux.s <dig>  and bux.s <dig>  have higher probabilities of effect .fig.  <dig>

variants in the reference strain
the variant positions with homozygous alleles that were common in all samples sequenced, but different from the reference genome, were considered possible errors in the reference assembly or mutations that had occurred during the time gap between the two dna preparations. re-sequencing of the reference genome allowed us to identify  <dig> genomic positions  that were different from the published genome  <cit> . the majority of them were homozygotic, and only two genomic positions had heterozygotic differences.

discussion
this is the first genome-wide attempt to understand the intra-species diversity of b. xylophilus. in this study, we sought to assess the extent of divergence among b. xylophilus genomes in japan, in which the nematode was introduced from its native area. furthermore, we attempted to relate the diversity to variability in phenotypic traits, such as virulence, reproductive ability on fungus and some ecological traits. we selected six representative strains of b. xylophilus isolated from different parts of japan that have different phenotypic or ecological traits and that have been used in several previous studies .

our genome-wide analysis revealed that b. xylophilus had a significantly high degree of genome variation between the strains . high levels of genome variations have also been observed in other nematodes, including c. brenneri, which exhibited  <dig>  % of polymorphic synonymous sites between individuals  <cit> , and two other caenorhabditis nematodes  were determined to have hyper-diverse genomes   <cit> . however, the fact that all b. xylophilus strains used in this study were isolated in japan and the observation of significant degrees of genomic variations between these strains highlighted the possibility that multiple introductions of this nematode occurred in japan from the native area.

all nematode strains exhibited a high degree of homozygosity, even in samples that did not undergo inbreeding  . this can be explained by the founder effect, in which the loss of genetic variation occurs when a new population is established by an extremely small number of individuals, and the wahlund effect, in which a reduction in heterozygosity occurs in a population caused by a subpopulation structure  <cit> . pwns multiply explosively from a small number of infected nematodes within individual trees, and they have subpopulation structures in the pathogenic lifecycle. moreover, the effect of strain maintenance in the laboratory, involving extremely short generation times and the transfer of a small number of nematodes to a new bottle, can decrease the genetic diversity within a population  <cit> .

the pn/ps ratio in the b. xylophilus strains  was extremely low compared with the ratio  found in p. pacificus  <cit> . this can be explained by the fact that b. xylophilus is a parasitic nematode and is likely to have experienced higher selective pressures in the host tree. alternatively, this nematode has a large population size, as it can multiply to millions in the host tree once the host has died. this large population size can also render very effective purifying selection  <cit> . the much higher pn/ps ratio found in the s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig> pair-wise comparison  is consistent with this explanation because the two inbred lines have not experienced that type of selection pressure after being separated in the inbred line generation process.

go enrichment analysis revealed that the strains studied contain high levels of possible loss of function due to frameshift or stop codon variations in proteins related to proteolysis, which includes metallopeptidase activity, aspartic-type endopeptidase activity and cysteine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity . this is probably because the number of peptidase gene families in the b. xylophilus genome has expanded, comprising  <dig> genes, representing the biggest gene number of genes among sequenced nematodes  <cit> . the fact that such variants were enriched in these genes may suggest that regions with such expansions are also subject to change in terms of point mutations or small insertions and deletions.

strains c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig> have distinct phenotypes and ecological traits from other b. xylophilus strains . they multiply slowly on fungi and exhibit extremely low virulence to pine trees. therefore, to survive in nature, they should have a strategy and lifecycle that are distinct from those of the typical pathogenic strains, and a hypothesis that their origin is different from other strains has been proposed. isolating this type of population from the wild is difficult, and only two natural isolates have been reported to date; they are neither highly populous around japan nor involved in the massive pine death in this country . the phylogeny based on all snp locations in the genome suggested that the two strains are only distantly related to the other strains, but are not closely related to each other within the clade . these results suggested that similarly to the typical pwn populations, this type of population was also introduced several times into japan, or they had been present for a long time in japan before the typical pwn was introduced. furthermore, the lower pn/ps ratio found in the comparison of c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig>  than in the other pair-wise comparisons  also suggested that these strains may have a different lifestyle in nature, in which they experienced different types of selective pressures compared with the other high-virulence strains.

our analysis revealed that two strains  shared many snps when compared with the other strains. go enrichment analysis suggested several aspartic-type endopeptidases would display loss of function in c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig> . other more specific activities, such as hydrolase activity acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds  in okd1-f <dig> or cystathionine gamma-lyase activity in both c14- <dig> and okd1-f <dig>  were also over-represented in possible loss-of-function variations . based on these results, one plausible explanation for the phenotypic differences between the two strains and the other strains  is likely to be the lack of activities of such effectors or digestive proteases, which could lead them to display low ingestion of nutrients and provoke a delay in development. in addition, the effects of unique variations in specific genes could also be important in explaining the different ecological traits of okd1-f <dig> and c14- <dig> 

in this study, we could not identify a role for some specific genes found in the low-virulence inbred line s10-p <dig>  however, functional loss of these genes supported the hypothesis that they are associated with the phenotypic differences between s10-p <dig> and s10-p <dig>  further research is required to determine the potential role of these genes in pathogenesis. the genes identified and described in this study  could be considered as potential factors that explain the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of pwn.

CONCLUSIONS
by re-sequencing several key strains of b. xylophilus, we conducted the first in-depth study of genome-wide variation in b. xylophilus populations. our findings demonstrated that the level of diversity in the b. xylophilus genome is high and comparable with that in other hyper-diverse organisms  <cit>  because the geographical range was restricted in this study . the results presented here highlighted that the level of genomic diversity of pwn was related to its phenotypic variability, including variations in pathogenicity and ecological traits. moreover, we identified a gene set affected by genomic variation, and functional annotation of those genes indicated that some of them had potential roles in pathogenesis. this study provided an important resource to understand the population structure, pathogenicity and evolutionary ecology of pwn in japan. this comparative genomics study with geographically diverse b. xylophilus populations will greatly accelerate our understanding of the complex evolutionary/epidemic history of this emerging pathogen.
