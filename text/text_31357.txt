BACKGROUND
recent taxonomic work by iversen et al.  <cit>  has led to an alternative classification of the organism, enterobacter sakazakii, and the proposal of a newly defined genus, cronobacter. cronobacter spp. are considered emerging opportunistic pathogens and are associated with outbreaks of infections amongst infants, in particular neonates  <cit> . symptoms include bacteremia, necrotizing enterocolitis and meningitis, with case fatality rates as high as 80% being reported. the prognosis for survivors is also poor, with neurological development being severely affected in many cases  <cit> . more recently the association of cronobacter with infections in adults has been investigated. gosney et al.  <cit>  described the isolation of cronobacter from seven adult stroke patients. see et al.  <cit>  reported a case of bacteremia in a  <dig> year old woman who presented with a splenic abscess. in total, thirteen cases of cronobacter infections in adults have been documented from  <dig> to present.

the primary origins of cronobacter spp. remain unknown. due to its ubiquitous nature, cronobacter can be isolated from a wide variety of foods including milk, cheese, dried foods, meats, water, vegetables, rice, bread, tea, herbs and spices  <cit> . surveillance studies have detected cronobacter in infant formula production, food processing, households and clinical environments. powdered infant formula  has been epidemiologically linked to cases of infection in infants, thus research has specifically focused on the monitoring of pif products for the presence of cronobacter. however, less is known regarding the prevalence of cronobacter in other dairy foods. recently, el-sharoud et al.  <cit>  examined dairy products from an egyptian market for the occurrence of the organism. cronobacter was isolated from skimmed milk and a related imitation soft cheese.

identifying foods that may contain cronobacter is important to discover the possible routes for transmission of infection. with the indication that cronobacter spp. infect both infants and vulnerable adults it is important that a wider variety of foods now be evaluated. the aim of this study was firstly, to determine if cronobacter could be found present in dried milk and related products and secondly, to characterize any isolates recovered.

isolation & identification
in total  <dig> dairy-based products obtained within the nile-delta region of egypt were tested for the presence of cronobacter. additionally, strain cfs-fsmp  <dig> from the environment of a milk powder factory was obtained from nestlé research centre, lausanne, switzerland. samples included full-fat milk powder , skimmed milk powder , dried whey , dried ice-cream , dried artificial cream , sahlab , pif , stored- cheese , and fresh domiatti cheese , kariesh cheese  and ras cheese  . collected samples represented different, commercially available brands of each product type. domiati cheese is a traditional egyptian, highly salted, enzyme-coagulated, soft cheese. similarly, ras cheese, also typically egyptian is a hard cheese that is prepared from raw cow's milk or a mixture of cow and buffalo's milk. kariesh cheese is a traditional egyptian soft cheese that is produced by acid coagulation of skim milk by culturing with lactic acid bacteria. sahlab is a dried blend consisting of dried skim milk, starch and nuts that is reconstituted in boiling water and served as a hot drink. isolation was performed according to a modification of the international organization for standards technical specification on the detection of e. sakazakii . in brief, samples were diluted 1: <dig>  in buffered peptone water   and homogenized. with regard to dried milk products and powders,  <dig> g of product was added to  <dig> ml bpw. for the various cheese samples,  <dig> g of product was added to  <dig> ml bpw. following an overnight incubation at 37°c,  <dig> ml of the pre-enrichment culture was inoculated into  <dig> ml of enterobacteriacae enrichment  broth and incubated overnight at 37°c. a  <dig> μl volume of the selective enrichment was then streaked onto a chromogenic media, dfi agar .

presumptive positive isolates producing blue-green colonies were identified using rapid id 32e test galleries  as per the manufacturer's instructions. isolates identified as cronobacter  were confirmed using a modified version of the real-time pcr method described by seo and brackett  <cit> . in short, a primer set and probe targeting the dnag gene located internally to the macromolecular synthesis  operon was applied  <cit> .

the cronobacter genus currently consists of six genomospecies  <cit> . to this end, isolates confirmed as cronobacter were speciated using biochemical differentiation tests as described by iversen et al.  <cit>  and recn gene sequence analysis ).

antibiotic susceptibility testing
cronobacter isolates were tested for their susceptibility to ampicillin , compound sulphonamides , furazolidone , gentamicin , neomycin , spectinomycin , streptomycin , and trimethoprim  using the kirby-bauer disc diffusion method  <cit> . antibiotic disks were obtained from oxoid, hampshire, uk.

molecular subtyping
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  was applied as described previously  <cit> . analysis was carried out using bionumerics software v <dig>  . a dendrogram was generated using the dice coefficient and unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean . a band tolerance and optimization coefficient of  <dig> % was applied.

repetitive sequence-based  amplification was performed using an automated rep-pcr system as previously described  <cit> . analysis was performed using diversilab® software v <dig>  . isolate similarity was calculated using the pearson correlation  coefficient.

recn gene sequencing
recn gene sequencing was performed by fasteris sa  using a modified version of the method described by kuhnert et al. ). pcr reactions were carried out in  <dig> ×  <dig> μl volume, which were then pooled together. the thermo cycling conditions employed were as follows: 95°c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles comprising 95°c for  <dig> s, 54°c for  <dig> s and 72°c for  <dig> min. a final extension of 72°c for  <dig> min was applied. the primers used for recn sequencing were:

es-l_seq1   5'-ctggcacaattaaccatcagtaa-3'

es-l_seq2   5'-ctggcacaattaaccatcagcaa-3'

es-r_seq   5'-tgggtaacgcacatcacctgagt-3'

a maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree  was generated using bionumerics software . gaps were not considered an extra state. the jukes-cantor correction was used to compensate for divergence being a logarithmic function of time due to the increased probability of a second substitution at a nucleotide site slowing the increase in the count of differences as divergence time increases  <cit> . felsenstein bootstraps  were applied to assess the level of confidence for each clade of the observed trees based on the proportion of bootstrap trees showing the same clade  <cit> . the topology of the maximum parsimony tree was optimized using simulated annealing. .

RESULTS
isolation & identification
a total of sixteen cronobacter strains were isolated from various food products . some of the non-cronobacter strains isolated included citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris and putative vibrio cholerae. presumptive positive isolates produced blue-green colonies on dfi agar and were identified as cronobacter  using id 32e test strips. real-time pcr analysis confirmed the detection of cronobacter isolates. biochemical tests were performed in order to distinguish the phenotypes of the cronobacter isolates and contribute to the speciation of the collection of strains. the results of these tests are shown in table  <dig>

pfge analysis
macrorestriction of cronobacter genomic dna with xbai yielded  <dig> to  <dig> dna fragments ranging in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kbp. a dendrogram was compiled which illustrates the fingerprint pattern similarities between the various cronobacter isolates . in total,  <dig> pulse-types  were identified that showed indistinguishable similarity.

rep-pcr analysis
the rep-pcr typing yielded between  <dig> and  <dig> dna fragments that ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp. a dendrogram representing the genetic relatedness amongst the isolates was composed . amongst the collection,  <dig> rep-pcr cluster groups  were identified that exhibited identical similarity.

recn gene sequencing
the results of the recn sequence analysis determined that two cronobacter species, c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus, had been isolated in this study. the sequences of the recn gene analysis for the following strains were deposited in the genbank database: cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig> , cfs-fsmp  <dig>  and cfs-fsmp  <dig> . a maximum parsimony tree was produced that displays the genetic relationship amongst the collection of strains . for comparison purposes a representative for each of the other cronobacter spp., c. dublinensis , c. genomospecies  <dig> , c. muytjensii , c. turicensis  and two novel enterobacter species, e. helveticus  and e. pulveris , which represent the closest related species of cronobacter, were also included in the analysis.

discussion
the focus of this study was to test a collection of dried milk and related products available in egypt for the presence of cronobacter. while pif has been identified as one vehicle of transmission for infection in infants, less is known regarding other dried dairy products. more recent reports have also identified cronobacter infections in immunocompromised adults, further highlighting the need to identify these organisms' primary origin for contamination. the food products tested included milk powders, pif, dried whey, dried ice-cream, sahlab and cheese and all were obtained from the nile-delta region of egypt. in total, a collection of sixteen cronobacter isolates were recovered from the foods tests and these were characterized using both pheno- and genotyping methods. the results of the biochemical assays identified the presence of  <dig> phenotype profiles amongst the collection of isolates .

pfge and rep-pcr analysis was performed for molecular characterization of the isolates. pfge typing identified  <dig> pulse-type cluster groups exhibiting ≥ 95% similarity. analysis using rep-pcr typing identified  <dig> cluster groups that showed ≥ 95% similarity. interestingly, rep-pcr clustered all the c. malonaticus isolates into a single cluster, denoted as rep-pcr type a, while the c. sakazakii isolates formed two distinct clusters, rep-pcr types b and c. isolates cfs-fsmp  <dig> and  <dig> produced unique phenotype profiles when compared with the other strains in the collection. pfge analysis also grouped the latter two isolates into distinct clusters, pulse-types  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. further work is needed to determine whether or not these strains represent unique subtypes of c. sakazakii. sequencing of the recn gene was applied to further characterize the isolates and confirm the species identification. this method was chosen as it has shown a higher discriminatory power with regard to the speciation of cronobacter isolates when compared to 16s rrna sequencing ). the method identified two cronobacter species recovered in this study, c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus. figure  <dig> outlines the genetic relationship between the cronobacter species type strains, the isolates from this study and the genetically closest enterobacter species. as expected, the isolates recovered from the foods studied, clustered with the type strains of c. sakazakii and c. malonaticus.

antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that all isolates were susceptible to ampicillin, compound sulphonamides, furazolidone, gentamicin, spectinomycin and streptomycin. these findings are in agreement with the data obtained by stock and wiedemann  <cit> . in their study they identified cronobacter as being more susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics, including ampicillin, when compared with the enterobacter species, e. amnigenus, e. cancerogenus and e. gergoviae. interestingly, the cronobacter isolates screened in their study were naturally susceptible to neomycin. the isolates cfs-fsmp  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were resistant to this antibiotic. neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, the mode of action of which is to bind to the 30s ribosomal subunit of bacteria. a possible reason behind this observed resistance could be an alteration to the binding site protein of the 30s subunit. such an occurrence has previously led to streptomycin resistance, another aminoglycoside compound. in the stock and wiedemann study  <cit>  all cronobacter and enterobacter strains tested were susceptible to antifolate compounds. however, in our study isolate cfs-fsmp  <dig> was resistant trimethoprim. trimethoprim is an antifolate compound and acts by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase enzymes in susceptible bacteria. resistance in gram-negative bacteria has previously been reported and it is believed that the mechanism of resistance lies within the expression of plasmid and/or transposon mediated dihydrofolate reductase genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study identified and characterized cronobacter isolates recovered from dried milk and related food products. although the majority of the strains were susceptible to the panel of antibiotics tested, resistance patterns observed in three isolates may indicate increasing risks to public health associated with the presence of cronobacter in foods. phenotypic and genotypic analysis should be applied to further monitor and characterize the presence of cronobacter in food production environments and prevent its transmission thereby improving food safety and quality.
