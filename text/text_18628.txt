BACKGROUND
gram-negative, facultative anaerobes of the genus shigella, the principal etiologic agents of bacillary dysentery, continue to pose a threat to public health, with an estimated annual incidence of  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million deaths worldwide  <cit> . they are sub-grouped into four species: shigella dysenteriae, shigella flexneri, shigella boydii and shigella sonnei. however, classification based upon serotype and other physiological properties has provided limited information regarding the genetic relationship between the species and, moreover, is not sufficient for making disease associations. the results of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing  argue that shigella diverged from escherichia coli in eight independent events and, therefore, may not constitute a separate genus  <cit> . however, these results can't reflect the influence of horizontal gene transfer and gene loss. and comparison of genomic differences between different flora and strains will be helpful in revealing gene acquisition and gene loss in bacteria genome evolution, and in revealing the genetic basis of the diversity of biological activities  <cit> .

what remains particularly intriguing about shigella, are the unique epidemiological and pathological features that each of the species exhibits. for example, shigella dysenteriae serotype  <dig> can cause fatal epidemics in africa; however, shigella boydii is restricted to the indian sub-continent, whereas shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei are prevalent in developing and developed countries  <cit> . development of a vaccine remains a significant task. comparative genome information will assist achieving this goal as well as enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of shigella. reports on the genome of the two s. flexneri 2a strains previously revealed a dynamic nature and unique characteristics when compared to the genomes of close relatives, the non-pathogenic k- <dig> strain and enterohemorrhagic o157:h <dig> strain of e. coli  <cit> . furthermore, we also have completed a project, which involved sequencing strains of s. dysenteriae sd <dig> serotype  <dig>  s. boydii sb <dig> serotype  <dig> and s. sonnei ss <dig>  all epidemic isolates from the 1950s in china  <cit> . the release of five shigella sequences has initiated a new era of comparative genomics in shigella biology. however, sequencing remains a laborious and expensive technique, making it difficult to obtain answers concerning the genetic composition of serotypes, or newly emerged variants of interest in a timely manner. the technique of microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization  provides a valuable adjunct to current protocols used for the assessment of differences and changes in bacterial genetic content. indeed, this approach has already been utilized in a variety of bacteria to probe for differences between clinical isolates, vaccine strains, species diversity, and disease endemicity  <cit> . there is currently data on five shigella genomes, which can reflect four lineage gene contents of shigella. such diversified genomic compositions stated previously  <cit>  have prompted us to investigate gene distributions among all lineages of shigella using a cgh microarray approach. herein, we present the results of a genomic comparison of  <dig> shigella strains based on cgh analysis, which maximizes and extends the information gained from genome sequencing efforts to closely related strains. and this sequence information will provide a valuable resource from which we can begin to dissect shared and distinct features of shigella between different lineages and start exploring how and why these differences arose. in addition, the pattern of acquisitions and deletions detected on the dna arrays may, to some extent, reflect the gene contents of eight lineages and the evolution of a strain's genome.

RESULTS
analysis of control hybridizations indicates the level of sensitivity of the microarray
results for the four sequenced shigella strains' hybridization were directly compared to expected hybridization results as assessed by the percent identity of each mg <dig> and shigella amplicon to the four sequenced shigella genome sequences. from this analysis, we were able to determine that genes with â‰¥ 75% identity to the amplicon could be detected as present/conserved on our array, whereas genes that diverged by more than 74% could be assigned as absent/divergent . it is noted that positive signals in the cgh analysis may not indicate the presence of functional genes or a pathway. for example, although fec genes are present in sd <dig>  ss <dig> and a few other strains, only ss <dig> possesses an intact set.

genome order analysis of e. coli dataset reveals discrete regions among shigella serotypes
generally, the results of the cgh demonstrated that the genome contents of shigella spp. isolates differ markedly from that of e. coli strain mg <dig>  the number of orfs, which comprised the backbone sequence of shigella spp. strains used in this study, was  <dig> , which was less than the number cited in previous reports  <cit> . these conserved orfs included all  <dig> essential protein-encoding genes listed in the pec database except  <dig> orfs not spotted on the microarrays  <cit> .

 <dig>  orfs of mg <dig> were found to be absent in at least one strain . these orfs accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all mg <dig> orfs annotated and spotted on the slides, respectively. the numbers of absent orfs ranged from  <dig> in b <dig> to  <dig> in b <dig> . the mean number of absent genes was  <dig>  which is consistent with data from a previous study  <cit> . there were  <dig> mg <dig> specific orfs absent in all strains. among which  <dig> orfs were absent in pathogenic e. coli too  <cit> . the mosaic distribution of the absent regions and some gene clusters is shown in figure 1a. genes for cell motility, cell envelope, and carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes in the mg <dig> genome  were frequently found missing in the shigella spp. strains . for example, among the  <dig> strains of shigella in our study,  <dig> showed a loss of several flagellar genes to different extents, while the other  <dig> strains had almost complete flagellar gene sequences. moreover, e. coli surface pili have about  <dig> gene clusters, among which only  <dig>  are found in most shigella strains, which is in accordance with previous results  <cit> .  <dig> identified orfs of mg <dig> have been annotated with regulatory functions in the pec database  <cit> . out of the  <dig>  missing orfs,  <dig> are regulatory genes, the majority of which are regulatory transcription factors, including a few global regulatory factors. this result is consistent with the findings from the previous study  <cit> . in addition, ompt, encoding outer-membrane protease, was found lost in all the strains, and cada, encoding lysine decarboxylase, was not found in most strains, either.

#the % indicated in parenthesis is relative to mg <dig> total orfs.

in general, what we found was that the gene contents of most categories are more variable in c <dig> strains than those in others. for instance,  <dig> % and  <dig> % genes coding for carbohydrate and amino acid transport proteins and signal transduction proteins respectively, were absent from at least one strain of c <dig>  in contrast, strains from c <dig> shared relatively more core genes of most categories than those from the other two groups . however, it should be noted that the three shigella groups consist of different number of strains which may also be a key influence to the count of conserved genes here.

the alterations were observed scattered over the entire e. coli mg <dig> chromosome. however, the prophages of strain mg <dig> represent chromosomal variation "hot spots." at least  <dig> prophages and phage like regions were identified in mg <dig>  <cit> , but few were intact among shigella spp. strains.

genes for transport and metabolism of carbohydrates
e. coli is able to utilize several types of carbohydrates. however, shigella has lost the capability to use some carbohydrates due to the loss of several transport and conjugated genes, which are also the basis for the biochemical typing of shigella spp. strains. cgh result indicated that the missing genes were different in different strains. by means of cgh analysis, it was found that the lac operon is only intact in b <dig> and b <dig>  while laca and lacy are absent in all other strains. this result conforms to the observation that shigella cannot ferment lactose. moreover, the metabolism of mannitol, melitose and glycerol are also in accordance with the cgh results, however, results from galactitol and rhamnose show discordance with the cgh data. the reason for this discrepancy requires further investigation. furthermore, the fact that shigella is unable to use xylose differs from the cgh result with s. flexneri, and may be explained to a certain extent by a terminating mutation found occurring in xyla, the gene encoding d-xylose isomerase  <cit> . the cgh results for genes related to transport and metabolism of some carbohydrates are shown in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of known and putative virulence-associated genes
there were  <dig> shigella orfs that were not present in mg <dig>  on the microarray . since part of them were also present in some pathogenic escherichia coli strains, those orfs may be putative virulence-associated genes. shiga toxin was only found in d <dig>  previously identified shigella pathogenicity islands shi- <dig> and shi- <dig> are absent in sd <dig> but present in other sequenced strains   <cit> . shi- <dig> encodes an enterotoxin shet <dig> and proteases siga and pic, all implicated in virulence  <cit>  and shi- <dig>  encode an aerobactin system for iron acquisition  <cit> . variants of the shi- <dig> and shi- <dig>  that were missing one or more marker regions were found in most shigella strains. the siga gene was conserved in most strains, while the pic gene was absent. shi- <dig> is almost complete in s. flexneri while lost in d <dig> and d <dig>  the iuc and iuta genes that encode siderophore and its receptor in the shi- <dig>  island are present in all of the other strains. sci island, the possible pathogenicity island that has been found in genome sf <dig>  <cit> , almost exist in all s. flexneri strains except f <dig>  but are all missing in the other strains. and the pdu gene cluster, which is correlated with propanediol utilization, only exists in ss. the result of complete shigella islands is showed in figure 1b, while the result of selected virulence genes is showed in figure  <dig> 

compared with e. coli k- <dig>  most shigella strains are missing fec, but have retained feo, fep, and fhu, and have even developed their own iron transport system . the type ii secretion system  encoded by genes of the general secretion pathway is widely distributed in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . the well-known e. coli t2ss, encoded by the yhe genes at  <dig>  min of the mg <dig> chromosome, is absent in all sequenced shigella genomes but present in several tested strains. moreover, there is a novel set of gsp genes in the sd <dig> and sb <dig> chromosomes, which is also present in all c <dig> strains  and several other strains .

lineage relationships are revealed by phylogenic analysis
using the above cgh microarray data and the previously published data  <cit> , we performed phylogenic analysis . the phylogenic tree shows that most of the shigella strains can be grouped into three clusters  leaving ss, d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and b <dig> as additional minor branches. ss is closer than d <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and b <dig> to the main clusters. c <dig> contains d strains  and b strains  with f <dig> as minorities. c <dig> is mainly composed of b strains  and d <dig>  c <dig> consists mostly of f strains  and b <dig>  the results are in good agreement with the mlst result  <cit> , supporting the hypothesis that shigella species originated from multiple e. coli strains with diverse genetic backgrounds. furthermore, two sonnei strains are grouped with three eiec strains, and other pathogenic e. coli strains are grouped together. the high bootstrap values of most branches confirm the robustness of the tree.

in addition to what was discussed above, we also found many specific differences between different lineages, providing a window into understanding bacterial speciation and taxonomic relationships . for example, ybcz/ylca, which encodes a two-component signal transduction system that is responsive to copper ions, is absent in three lineages , and the locus glc, which is associated with the glycolate utilization trait in e. coli, is only present in cluster  <dig> strains , several cluster  <dig> strains and b <dig>  the locus aga, which is related to acetylgalactosamine metabolism, is only conservative in cluster  <dig>  b <dig> and d <dig> 

f <dig> sits in a different cluster as compared to the other flexneri strains and we found many differences that set it apart . for example, gsp genes, yea genes, waawyji, rhsabc and several phage-related genes were present in f <dig> and absent in other s. flexneri strains, while the cai-fix gene cluster, ybcz-ylca-ylcb, marab, yehabcde, glc genes, dgotak, bglbfg, yih genes, malgfe and safabc were absent in f <dig> but present in other members of s. flexneri.

discussion
abundant information is currently available for research on the genome evolutions of different organisms and the exploration of the roles played by different genes in their life processes. however, more and more evidence has revealed that most bacteria have shown unexpected diversity during the evolutionary process, even within one species  <cit> .

advantages and disadvantages of cgh technique
in order to systematically assess the genetic variability of bacteria, several genome comparison techniques, e.g., multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, mlst, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and restriction fragment length polymorphisms, have been used. microarray-based cgh has emerged as a revolutionary platform for comparative genomics that has recently been used for the analysis of genome variability among bacterial species or closely related bacteria. given that the sequencing of strains on a large scale is time-consuming, laborious and unfeasible at present, cgh may resolve the problem to some extent by applying the available genome sequence information to closely related species. and this method can supply more information about genome composition and provide opportunity to analysis unsequenced strain on genomic scale. cgh proved a useful tool in this study for identifying genetic differences between different shigella lineages over other techniques. even though this technique has several limitations as described before  <cit> , we believe, based on the criteria for data analysis, which we described before, that the use of cgh technology allows sufficient assessment of the genetic diversity and gene content among shigella spp. strains.

genomic diversity of shigella
an mlst study  <cit>  and five reported shigella genomes  <cit>  have suggested strongly that shigella is derived from multiple origins of e. coli. and the five shigella genomes vary in size from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb. our study has revealed extensive diversity among shigella genomes, forming a genetic basis to explain species/strain specific epidemiological and pathological features. the phylogenic analysis results supporting the hypothesis that shigella have emerged from multiple independent origins. the fact that two sonnei strains are grouped with three eiec strains supports the hypothesis that eiec strains are in an intermediate stage and are a potential precursor of "full-blown" shigella strains  <cit> . based on our results, we believe that the reason why shigella exhibits unique epidemiological and pathological features is due to the loss of several genes and gene acquisition as described above. we found many specific differences between different lineages that never been described before. previous study showed that there was over-representation of regulatory genes in the missing orfs in shigella/eiec strains  <cit> . our result reconfirmed this observation. how these genomic differences account for the differences in epidemiology and pathology remain to be elucidated. a comparison with respect to the new group relationship is particularly significant in providing insight into the virulence of shigella, such as f <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig>  b <dig>  etc. furthermore, f <dig>  which is distinct from other flexneri strains in several ways, should not be considered a flexneri member. and our results support the brenner's suggestion to transfer f <dig> to the boydii subgroup  <cit> .

currently, there are data on five shigella genomes, which can reflect only four lineage gene contents of shigella. our cgh results may, to some extent, reflect the entire genome diversity within shigella and the evolution of a strain's genome. in addition, we found a large number of deletions in different genes of the relevant operon in carbohydrate utilization, emphasizing strong evidence for the extinction of these metabolic pathways. after shigella became pathogenic to humans, the host presented a constant environment rich in metabolic intermediates, some genes were rendered useless by adoption of a strictly pathogenic life-style. these superfluous sequences were eliminated through mutational bias favouring deletions, a process apparently universal in bacterial lineages  <cit> .

the findings that diverse mechanisms appear to be responsible for same biochemical characteristics reconfirm the convergent evolution that shigella might have experienced. for example, shigella strains cannot decompose lactose, but each has resulted from a different mechanism. some strains lost the lac operon completely, while others only lost laca and lacy. the reasons to no flagellum and no motility of shigella are also diverse.

genetic basis for variation in virulence
understanding the virulence of shigella, in addition to the cgh data, facilitates our understanding of the scenario that underlies the difference between these organisms. the pattern of acquisitions and deletions detected, may explain these differences to some extent. on loss and gain functions, it is important to recognize these differences may enhance the virulence or lead to variation in virulence. variants of shi- <dig> that were missing one or more marker regions were found in most shigella strains. the shi- <dig> island is only absent in strains d <dig> and d <dig>  indicating its importance to most of the strains, and the unique iron acquisition mechanisms in the two d strains. furthermore, our results indicate that shi- <dig> and shi- <dig> are genetic elements that have disseminated throughout shigella and diverged into distinct structural forms, emphasizing their importance in shigella pathogenesis.

previous study argues that the gsp genes in s. dysenteriae, encoding the t2ss, ought to contribute significantly to pathogenicity as it enables stx to reach the target host cells from proliferating bacteria <cit> . our cgh result indicates a wide distribution of the gsp genes among strains from all phylogenetic groups which suggests that many strains possessed stx before their subsequent loss. perhaps, loss of stx genes has provided advantages to the bacteria for a better adaptation to the human hosts as causing severer disease offers little benefit to the organisms for long term survival. it is known that the deletion of certain genomic regions present in e. coli  enhances the virulence of shigella  <cit> . these pathoadaptive deletions could be identified as "absent" on the arrays. our cgh results demonstrated the existence of those "black holes" in all lineages.

the comparative genomic analysis between pathogenic and non-pathogenic e. coli strains reveals that a specific genetic background is required for acquisition and expression of virulence factors  <cit> . furthermore, we found that the iron transport system, which is virulence related, is reinforced in shigella by the development of its own iron transport system, in addition to the retention of most of the iron transport system from e. coli. shigella species express numerous iron acquisition systems, reflecting the importance of obtaining iron. a previous study which focused on transcriptome polymorphism of shigella/eiec also indicated that it was important to acquire iron for shigella/eiec  <cit> . these results indicate that the acquisition of some genes has enhanced the ability of shigella species to adapt to the complicated host environment during its evolution into an intestinal pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the comparisons performed in this study are necessary for further understanding the implications of genetic background in the evolution of shigella pathogenicity. these findings provide an invaluable genetic basis for future studies examining bacterial evolution, as well as pathogenicity, and the development of novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of shigellosis.
