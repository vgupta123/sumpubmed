BACKGROUND
wax esters are long chain esters that are derived from fatty acids and alcohols with chain lengths of  <dig> carbons or more. the compounds have many potential applications due to their excellent wetting behavior at interfaces  <cit>  and a non-greasy feeling when applied on skin surfaces. wax esters are important ingredients in cosmetic formulations , pharmaceuticals , lubricants, plasticizers and polishes and other chemical industries  <cit> .

natural waxes originate from animals, vegetables and minerals. many of the important commercial waxes contain rather high percentages of saturated wax esters, such as beeswax. other raw materials for saturated and unsaturated wax esters are sperm whale and jojoba oil  <cit> . since the naturally occurring wax esters are expensive and limited in access, the need to synthesize the compound has grown. wax esters have been synthesized via chemical  <cit>  and enzymatic reactions  <cit> . enzymatic synthesis uses lower temperatures than chemical synthesis  <cit> .

wax esters can be produced by alcoholysis of vegetable oils such as palm oil. palm oil consists of triacylglycerides, which are a combination of glycerol and different fatty acids. enzymatic synthesis of wax esters from rapeseed fatty acid methyl ester  <cit>  and lipase-catalyzed alcoholysis of crambe and camelina oil  <cit>  have been reported.

one of the most important stages in a biological process is modeling and optimization to increase the efficiency of the process . the classical method of optimization involves varying one parameter at a time and keeping the other constant. this technique is not only time-consuming but also does not depict the complete effects of the parameters in the process and ignores the combined interactions between the physicochemical parameters. in contrast, response surface methodology  is an effective statistical technique for developing, improving, and optimizing of complex process . rsm is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques that can be used to define the relationships between the response and the independent variables  <cit> . rsm defines the effect of the independent variables, alone or in combination, in the processes. in addition to analyzing the effects of the independent variables, this experimental methodology also generates mathematical model.

although rsm has so many advantages, and has successfully been applied to study and optimize the enzyme synthesis of flavor ester  and biodiesel   <cit>  and also optimizing enzyme production from microorganisms , it is hard to say that it is applicable to all optimization and modeling studies. baş and boyacı  <cit>  reported that the second-order polynomial equation was not suitable in explaining the effects of ph and substrate concentration on the initial reaction rate of the enzymatic reaction. similar observations were made on the data of some rsm articles .

the past decade has seen a host of data analysis tools based on biological phenomena developed into well-established modeling techniques, such as artificial intelligence and evolutionary computing. artificial neural networks  are now the most popular artificial learning tool in biotechnology, with applications ranging from pattern recognition in chromatographic spectra and expression profiles, to functional analyses of genomic and proteomic sequences  <cit> . an artificial neural network is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. indeed an artificial neural network is a massively interconnected network structure consisting of many simple processing elements capable of performing parallel computation for data processing. the fundamental processing element of artificial neural networks  simulates the basic functions of biological neurons .

in the present investigation, rsm and ann analysis of enzymatic synthesis of wax esters from palm oil and oleyl alcohol was carried out using a commercial immobilized lipase.

response surface methodology
fitting the data to various models  and their subsequent anova showed that reactions of palm oil and oleyl alcohol were most suitably described with quadratic polynomial model :

 yield  = - <dig> +  <dig> a +  <dig> b +  <dig> c + 508d -  <dig> a2-  <dig> b <dig> -  <dig> c <dig> - 655d <dig> -  <dig> ab -  <dig> ac +  <dig> ad -  <dig> bc -  <dig> bd -  <dig> cd 

where a is the temperature; b the time; c the molar ratio; and d the amount of enzyme.

the computed model f-value of  <dig> was higher than tabular value of f <dig>  =  <dig> , implying the model are significant at 1% confidence level. the model also showed statistically insignificant lack of fit, as was evident from the lower computed f value  than the tabular f <dig>  value  at 1% level. on the other hand, the pure error was very low, indicating good reproducibility of the data obtained. with very small p-value  from the analysis of anova and a suitable coefficient of determination , the quadratic polynomial model was highly significant and sufficient to represent the actual relationship between the response  and the significant variables . zhou et al. reported that satisfactory quadratic response models were obtained for the incorporation of caproic acid into rapeseed oil  <cit> . similar model was shown by shieh et al.  <cit>  and chen et al.  <cit>  who determined the optimization of lipase-catalyzed synthesis for biodiesel  and kojic acid mono laurate, respectively.

a significant at "prob > f" less than  <dig> 

b insignificant at "prob > f" more than  <dig> 

artificial neural network
effect of architecture and topology on neural network performance
the selection of an optimal neural-network architecture and topology is of critical importance for a successful application. several neural-network architecture and topologies  were tested for the estimation and prediction of lipase-catalyzed synthesis of palm-based wax ester. table  <dig> summarizes the top five ann models.

a incremental back propagation

b multilayer full feedforward

c multilayer normal feedforward

d hyperbolic tangent function

the effect of learning algorithm and transfer function
training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models that minimizes the cost criterion. we have tested different learning algorithms for training neural network models. all accepted models  have shown that incremental back propagation  was the most suitable learning algorithm for prediction of lipase-catalyzed synthesis of palm-based wax ester .

according to ibp learning algorithm, in training, a set of inputs is presented to a network of randomly preassigned weights. each neuron in the hidden and output layers first calculates the weighted sum of its inputs and passes the result through a transfer function to produce an estimate as output that corresponds to the input data set. the result is compared to the corresponding desired values and the error is back-propagated through the network to adjust the connection weights according to the learning rule. this procedure is repeated iteratively, until the predetermined target rmse is reached  <cit> .

the type of transfer function employed affects the neural network's learning rate and is instrumental in its performance. in the present work, among all employed transfer functions for hidden and output layers, accepted models  were produced by linear function for output layer and hyperbolic tangent  or gaussian function for hidden layer that between them, the best models have been obtained by hyperbolic tangent  function.

optimal number of hidden neurons
although it is important to select the optimal number of hidden neurons carefully, depending on the type and complexity of the task, this usually has to be done by trial and error. an increase in the number of hidden neurons up to a point usually results in a better learning performance. too few hidden neurons limit the ability of the neural network to model the process, and too many may allow too much freedom for the weights to adjust and, thus, to result in learning the noise present in the database used in training  <cit> . we tested the effect of number of hidden neurons on the goodness of fit. the results of testing with the two sample experiments, evaluated statistically on the basis of the coefficient of determination , are shown in figure  <dig>  in all examined cases, the optimum number of hidden neurons was  <dig>  with an obvious increase in the calculation time and overfitting when too many hidden neurons were used. then the 4-15- <dig> topology was chosen as the best topology for estimation of wax ester percentage yield.

artificial neural network analysis of synthesis of palm-based wax ester
the best ann chosen in the present work was a multilayer full feedforward incremental back propagation network with tanh transfer function  that consisted of a 4-15- <dig> topology . the optimized values of network for learning rate and momentum were  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the learning was completed in rmse =  <dig> , r =  <dig> and dc =  <dig>  in the case of training data set, the coefficient of determination  and absolute average deviation  were  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively, whereas for the testing data set, r <dig> was  <dig>  and aad was  <dig>   and for validating data sets r <dig> and aad were,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . comparison of predicted and experimental values in training, testing and validating data sets, not only revealed capability of ann in prediction of known data responses  but also showed the ability of generalization for unknown data  and implying that empirical models derived from ann can be used to adequately describe the relationship between the input factors and output in lipozyme-catalyzed synthesis of wax ester from palm oil and oleyl alcohol.

comparison of rsm and ann predicted values
the predicted output values of rsm and ann are shown in table  <dig>  though both the models based on rsm and ann preformed well and offered stable responses in predicting the combined interactions of the independent variables with respect to the response, yet the ann based approach was better in fitting to the measured response in comparison to the rsm model.

effect of parameters
finally, figure  <dig> shows the importance of percentage of effective parameters on the percentage yield. time with  <dig> % is the most important factor on the percentage yield, temperature with  <dig> %, amount of enzyme with  <dig> % and substrate molar ratio with  <dig> % are subsequent degrees of importance.

optimization of reaction
the optimal conditions for the lipozyme-catalyzed synthesis of wax esters were predicted as presented in table  <dig> along with their predicted and actual values. among the various optimum conditions, the highest percentage yield  was from experiment  <dig>  however, a reaction condition of  <dig> °c,  <dig>  h, substrate molar ratio 1: <dig>  and  <dig> % amount of enzyme  was chosen as the optimum condition, because experiment  <dig> used more enzymes to achieve highest percentage yield. although experiment  <dig> used more substrates than experiment  <dig>  enzyme is more expensive than substrate. if it was necessary to complete the synthesis within  <dig> h without the concern for cost, the time factor should be considered first, and then the other factors could be maximized. all the optimum conditions could be used to produce high percentage yield of wax esters. attention to r <dig> and aad values between actual and estimated responses demonstrated a higher prediction accuracy of ann compared to rsm.

the quantitative analysis of the products using gc showed that the alcoholysis of palm oil with oleyl alcohol produced esters with different chain length fatty acids. the composition of synthesized esters at optimum condition is presented in table  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
this study compared the performance of the rsm and ann in the estimation of lipozyme-catalyzed synthesis of wax ester from palm oil and oleyl alcohol. though both models provided good quality predictions for the four independent variables  in terms of the percentage yield of wax esters, yet the ann methodology showed a clear superiority over rsm as a modeling technique for data sets showing nonlinear relationships. as a modeling technique, artificial neural network was better than rsm for both data fitting and estimation capabilities. regression-based response surface models require the order of the model to be stated   <cit> , but unfortunately most of the packed program produced for the application of rsm use second order model equation and then the major drawback of rsm is to fit the data to a second order polynomial, while ann tends to implicitly match the input vectors to the output vector . indeed ann is a superior and more accurate modeling technique when compared to the rsm as it represents the nonlinearities in much better way  <cit> .

on the other hand, neural networks also have the disadvantage of requiring large amounts of training data in comparison with rsm that offers a large amount of information from a small number of experiments. this advantage of rsm is because of its experimental design  <cit> . to overcome this ann problem, in present study we used the rsm idea, and then a statistical experimental design, ccrd, was employed to reduce the number of experiments. thus, ann could be a very powerful and flexible tool for modeling the optimization process.
