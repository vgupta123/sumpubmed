BACKGROUND
since its first discovery in caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , microrna  has been seen as a key regulator of gene expression  <cit> . mirnas are rna molecules ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides that down-regulate genes by guiding argonaute  proteins to form mirna-induced silencing complexes  leading to translational repression or mrna degradation  <cit> . currently, there are  <dig> mature human mirnas  and  <dig> mature mouse mirnas  . mirnas are regulated in a developmental stage-and tissue-specific fashion  <cit>  and are known to participate in diverse biological functions  <cit> . the dysregulation of mirnas has been correlated with the pathogenesis of various human diseases such as cancer  <cit> . cumulative evidence has shown that, similar to protein-coding genes, mirna genes primarily fall under transcriptional and epigenetic regulation  <cit> . with the advent of bioinformatics and high-throughput technology, several tf-mirna regulatory network databases have been constructed. circuitsdb performed human and mouse tf-mirna feed-forward regulatory loops  by predicting the tf promoter and mirna-target region  <cit> . wang et al.  <cit>  curated studies containing approximate  <dig> transcription factor-mirna regulations to create the transmir database. yang et al.  <cit>  integrated the high throughput chip-seq datasets to provide a web-based tool called chipbase to help detect transcription factor binding sites  for non-coding rnas including mirnas.

the power of mirna-target interactions  lies in their multiplicity and cooperativity. for nearly a decade, mtis were mostly obtained by way of computation and prediction. numerous bioinformatics tools were generated that were based primarily on mirna seed region complementarity with genes, free energy of mirna-rna duplexes, and conservation of target sites across the species  <cit> . widely used mtis prediction tools include targetscan  <cit> , miranda  <cit> , pictar  <cit>  and many others. the pace of identification of relevant mtis is rather slow, mostly due to the high rate of false-positive predictions of mirna binding sites. rapid progress in high throughput screening technologies such as microarrays, small rna sequencing  and rna sequencing  can expedite mti prediction. the most exciting breakthrough in recent years, however, is a method which allows for the direct collection of ago-mirna-mrna complexes by argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing. this experimental approach has advanced our understanding of mti interactions from prediction-based knowledge to a level that is empirically-and genome wide-based. representative technologies include clip-seq   <cit>  and clash sequencing   <cit>  which can directly detect mirna target sites. meanwhile, development of the web servers, dchip-gemini  <cit> , magia  <cit> , and mirconnx  <cit>  provides additional tools for constructing tf-mirna regulatory networks through integrating gene and mirna expression profiles with target prediction. as a proof-of-concept demonstration, the high-throughput techniques of clip-seq for mirna-target interaction and chip-seq for tf studies were found to accelerate discovery of tf-mirna-gene regulatory networks in human pancreatic cancer early this year  <cit> .

while experimental-based databases have become more popular for building gene regulatory networks, most reconstructed tf-mirna-gene regulation networks are still computation/prediction-based. we expect an analysis platform integrating high-throughput datasets from chip-seq for tf-mirna network and clip-seq and clash for mirna-target networks could be used to effectively explore significant tf-mirna-mtis interactions in any complex biological system with improved confidence.

we applied this integrated analysis platform to the mir122a knockout mouse  model of liver disease. microrna- <dig>  is a highly abundant, developmental-regulated, liver-specific mirna. it plays a pivotal role in maintaining lipid metabolism homeostasis  <cit>  and tumor suppression in the liver  <cit> . mir122a knockout mice  develop temporally-controlled steatohepatitis, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , a path similar to the disease progression in humans  <cit> . a striking feature of this mouse model is that mir-122a profoundly modulates the liver transcriptome. the pathway disturbances that might drive cancer initiation and progression are found in young mir122a-/- mice . to date we have detected the expression of  <dig> experimentally-verified mir- <dig> targets, which represents only  <dig> %  of the differentially expressed genes   <cit>  in mir122a-/- livers. since mir- <dig> represents ~70% of the liver mirnas, the imbalance of the mirna homeostasis in mir122a-/- liver can give rise to liver damage. a systematic, genome-wide investigation of the mirna-mediated regulatory networks will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which mir- <dig> modulates liver transcriptome and disease.

RESULTS
we reconstructed the mirna-mediated regulatory network in mouse livers using high-throughput expression profiles. the overview is shown in figure  <dig>  first, we identified degs by retrieving the multiple gene microarray datasets from geo . high-confidence differentially expressed mirnas  were derived from the intersection of two mirna expression profiles . second, we mapped the degs and demirs to the curated tf-mirna regulatory network as active nodes and removed the other non-mapping nodes. finally, we reconstructed the potential mirna-mediated regulatory network in mir122a-/- mouse livers.

differential expression of mirnas in mir122a-/- mice
to obtain a list of high confidence demirs in mir122a-/- mouse livers, we subjected the same pair of wild-type  and mir122a-/- mouse liver samples to small rna sequencing and openarray assay for mirna profiling. the profiling results from these two entirely different platforms showed a positive correlation . for each profiling technology, we selected demirs . considering that different platforms have different coverage for all mouse mirnas, we focus on the demirs presented by both small rna-seq and openarray assay. we identified  <dig> up-regulated mirnas  and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas  in mir122a-/- mouse livers. among the upmirs, expression of  <dig> mirnas  was highly elevated while  <dig> others showed moderate increase in expression . we studied the chromosomal locations and found that, remarkably, the group of  <dig> highly expressed upmirs is located in the imprinted dlk1-dio <dig> gene cluster on the mouse chromosome 12qf <dig> region . in contrast, only  <dig> dnmir  was located in the chr12qf <dig> region. no preferred chromosomal locations were assigned to those moderately increased upmirs and other dnmirs. we speculate that the promoter regions of chr12qf1-demirs operate under a similar mode of transcription regulation. we further investigated the tf-mirna regulation to support our speculation.

there are  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas in 2-month-old male mir122a-/-  and wt mice. the expression ratio between the mir-122-/- and wt  is shown.

potential tf-mirna regulatory networks in mir122a-/- mice
to understand whether these demirs are transcriptionally regulated by specific transcription factors in mir122a-/- mice, we reconstructed the tf-mirna regulatory networks by integrating two experimentally verified resources, chipbase  <cit>  and transmir  <cit> . chipbase is a comprehensive resource which includes annotated  <dig> tf-mirna relationships from  <dig> mouse chip experiments targeting  <dig> tfs. we identified a total of  <dig> tf-mirna interactions involving  <dig> tfs and  <dig> demirs. the tf-demirs regulatory network in the mir122a-/- hepatocyte is presented in figure  <dig> and detailed tf-demirs interactions are listed in tables s <dig>  and s <dig> . the results showed that, similar to the majority of the pol ii genes, one mirna can be regulated by different tfs  and one specific tf can modulate the expression of multiple target mirnas . ten of the  <dig> curated tfs, potentially regulating  <dig> mirnas, are verified as mir- <dig> target genes. ctcf  <cit>  is a mir- <dig> target gene found in the human hcc cell line, while hif1a  <cit>  is a recently confirmed mir-122a target in mouse hepatocytes. although the target relationship of mir- <dig> with ezh <dig>  mycbp, rbbp <dig>  sin3a, sin3b, sirt <dig>  srf and suz <dig> has not been studied in mouse liver but it has been identified in starbase with human samples. the fact that many target genes of mir- <dig> are common to both mouse and human it is highly likely that ezh <dig>  mycbp, rbbp <dig>  sin3a, sin3b, sirt <dig>  srf and suz <dig> are mouse mir-122a target genes. this result suggests that mir- <dig> can potentially modulate the expression of  <dig> mirnas via its target transcription factors.

the appearance of higher numbers of connections in some hub-tfs and hub-demirs suggests that these hub-tfs may play an essential role in the regulation of multiple demirs, and that the hub-demirs could potentially be regulated by multiple tfs in a combinatorial mode. for example, spleen focus forming virus  proviral integration oncogene  and ccctc-binding factor  are the top two hub-tfs . the expression level of both spi <dig> and ctcf is moderately increased  in mir122a-/- mice. ctcf can perhaps regulate  <dig> demirs including  <dig> upmirs and  <dig> dnmirs. most of the ctcf-upmirs  are located in chr12qf <dig> locus. spi <dig> could potentially regulate  <dig> demirs . our analysis also suggests that  <dig> demirs, mir-17-5p, mir-486b-5p, mir-19a-3p, mir- <dig>  mir-199a-5p and mir-182-5p, are likely to be co-regulated by both ctcf and spi <dig>  further experimentation is needed to support these initial findings. it is interesting to note that spi1-upmirs and ctcf-upmirs are respectively clustered within different regions of chr12qf <dig>  namely the meg3-rian region and mirg region.

network analysis of curated mirna target genes
since  <dig> demirs have no known validated targets , we collected the interactions of  <dig> demirs and  <dig>  degs to establish the mirna-target regulatory network. table  <dig> shows detailed statistics of the curated mtis. a total of  <dig>  interactions between the  <dig> demirs and  <dig> curated target genes were obtained. there are  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in the group of  <dig> curated targets. a total of  <dig> targets  are present in the group of  <dig> degs found in 2-month old mir122a-/- mice livers  <cit> . we were surprised to find that 56%  of degs in mir122a-/- mice livers are likely modulated by dysregulated mirnas. figures  <dig> and  <dig> respectively present the upmirs-regulatory network  and the dnmirs-regulatory network . the regulator hub-demirs in the two networks are mir-381-3p and mir-17-5p, respectively. moreover, down-regulated nfib and up-regulated trp53inp <dig> are the mirna target hubs .

a includes  <dig> up-regulated mirnas and  <dig> down-regulated mirnas

b includes  <dig> up-regulated target genes and  <dig> down-regulated target genes, for a total of  <dig> genes.

c includes  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes of the  <dig> differentially-expressed genes found in 2-month old mir122a-/- mouse livers  <cit> .

* indicates the unique gene count

the complex interplay of mirnas and target genes is accomplished through multiplicity and cooperativity. we identified  <dig> demirs that can simultaneously regulate  <dig> mir- <dig> targets . a priori., we reasoned that in mir122a-/- livers, elevated expression of klf <dig>  a mir- <dig> target gene  <cit> , is a simple response to the loss of mir-122a; nonetheless, elevated expression of klf <dig> is likely to be the sum of a cascade of events involving the loss of mir-122a and the down regulation of  <dig> other dnmirs . our analysis supports the conclusion that mirnas and transcription factors are two major classes of gene regulators using similar control principles, namely one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between the regulator and the target genes  <cit> .

the differentially expressed target genes were analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis . selected molecular and cellular functions significantly enriched in the degs under the categories of "diseases and biological functions" and "canonical pathways" are respectively listed in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  while tables s <dig>  and s <dig>  respectively provide detailed gene lists. as shown in figure  <dig>  different functional enrichment in the category of "diseases and functions" was identified for the target genes of upmirs and dnmirs. the functions of the upmir-targets are involved in the negative regulation of lipid metabolism, energy production, and rna processing. they also contribute to connective tissue disorders and metabolic disease. in contrast, the functional roles of the dnmir-targets are significantly associated with the promotion of cell cycles, tissue development and cell-to-cell signalling.

to further understand their functional involvement, the group of differentially expressed target genes was used for ipa canonical pathway analysis. as shown in figure  <dig>  different functional enrichment was assigned to the target genes of upmirs and dnmirs. the upmir-targets are involved in the negative regulation of the biosynthesis of macromolecules, while the dnmir-targets participates in various cell signalling pathways for cell adhesion, proliferation, cell transformation and hepatic fibrosis. highly significant enriched pathways such as signalling for actin cytoskeleton/actin-based mobility by rho, hepatic stellate cell activation, pka signalling, erk signalling, pten signalling and nf-κb signalling, were enriched only for dnmir-targets. the ipa analysis results strongly suggest that upmirs-targets are involved in loss-of-function activities, while dnmirs-targets work in a gain-of-function manner. figure s <dig> -s <dig>  and s <dig> -s <dig>  respectively show the pathway presentation of the causal network analysis of "diseases and functions" and "canonical pathways".

discussion
in this case study we analyzed the mirna-mediated regulatory network in mir122a-/- mouse livers and identified a complex interplay of tf-mirna and mirna-targets by way of multiplicity and cooperativity. using similar control principles, tf and mirna can jointly fine-tune the target gene expression. the results of this study showed that altered expression of mirnas in mir-122a-deficient livers had far-reaching effects on liver homeostasis. previously we demonstrated that fibrotic and tumor signature genes were induced early in mir122a deficient livers  <cit> . the current study provided additional new evidence to reveal that the interplay between differentially expressed mirnas and their target genes not only contributes greatly to the properties we previously characterized but also raised new activities to assist the process of cell transformation of mir122a-/- hepatocytes. a general theme of demir-target interaction is that upmirs-targets are involved in loss-of-function activities while dnmirs-targets contribute to gain-of-function activities.

in the absence of the abundant liver-specific mir-122a, the altered expression of demirs did not reinstate the normal physiological functions of mir-122a, but rather expedited the hepatocyte de-differentiation. several lines of evidence supported our observation.  demirs synergistically heighten the adverse effect of mir-122a deficiency. we found a group of  <dig> dnmirs that can potentially target  <dig> mir-122a target genes. these  <dig> dnmirs are mir-144-3p, 17-5p, 93-5p, 322-5p, 19a-3p, 31-5p, 145a-5p, 335-5p and 345-5p . mir-144-3p and mir-17-5p can respectively recognize  <dig> and  <dig> mir-122a targets. upregulation of the mir-122a-co-targets contribute to altered cell adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, protein phosphorylation, ion transport, glucose catabolic process and liver fibrosis.  induced expression of chr12qf <dig> mirnas was detected in mutant hepatocytes. the imprinted dlk1-dio <dig> gene cluster is located on mouse chromosome  <dig>  and human chromosome <dig> . concurrent overexpression of chr12qf <dig> mirnas is regarded as the mirna signature of the stem cell property  <cit>  and overexpression of 14q <dig>  mirnas has been detected in cancer stem cells and in aggressive types of human hcc  <cit>  as well as in other cancer types  <cit> .  upregulation of several upmirs has been reported in hcc despite the fact the 2-month old mir122a-/- livers are free of tumors. elevated expression of mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir- <dig>  <cit> , mir-199a, 199a*, 200a, and 200b was positively and significantly correlated to the progression of liver fibrosis  <cit> . these results reinforce our previous findings that dysregulation of liver functions begins in young mir122a-/- mice  <cit> .

in mir122a-/- livers, overexpression of several classic imprinted genes h <dig>  igf <dig>  meg <dig>  mirg and rian signals for altered epigenetic regulation. how mir- <dig> influences epigenetic regulation of degs is not clear. it has been reported that many mirna targets are involved in gene regulation at the epigenetic level  <cit> . from the curated mirna-target interactions, several enzymes affecting methylation of dna or histones were found to be the target genes of upmirs. tet methylcytosine dioxygenase  <dig> , lysine -specific demethylase 7a  and jumonji domain containing 1c  are respectively targeted by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> upmirs . whether reduced expression of these enzymes is linked to epigenetic regulation of degs in mir122a-/- mice requires further experimental demonstration. it is worth mentioning that ctcf, an insulator-and chromatin loop-associated protein as well as an epigenetic regulator, is a direct target of mir- <dig>  <cit> .

tf-demir interactions revealed that ctcf, a hub-tf, potentially can regulate  <dig> demirs including  <dig> upmirs and  <dig> dnmirs. a great proportion of the ctcf-upmirs  is located in the chr12qf <dig> locus. recently, ctcf was found to be involved in the regulation of mir-125b <dig>  mir- <dig>  and the mir- <dig> cluster in breast cancer cells and stem cells  <cit> . dna methylation seems to play a role in the ctcf regulation of mirnas since ctcf binding sites tend to be mapped to the hypomethylated regions  <cit> . our initial methylome data also showed that the ctcf binding sites in the chr12qf <dig> locus are less methylated in mir122a-/- than in the wt liver .

CONCLUSIONS
we applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of the mirna/mrna from mir122a-/- mutant mice and wild-type mice and found a mirna-mediated network involving  <dig> curated tfs regulating the aberrant expression of  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> curated mirna target genes, of which 56% was found in the differentially expressed genes of mir122a-/- mice. this regulatory network disclosed previously known as well as many previously unidentified mirna-mediated regulations in mutant mice. remarkably, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at 12qf <dig> is associated with mirna overexpression in human hcc and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous changes in young mice deficient in mir- <dig>  in addition, a group of  <dig> mirnas was found to share mir- <dig> target genes, indicating synergy between mirnas and target genes by way of multiplicity and cooperativity. these findings have a potentially significant impact on our understanding of mirna-mediated regulatory networks. by collectively utilizing the experimentally verified data, this computational framework is highly reliable, effective and is suitable for exploring significant tf-mirna-mirna target interactions in any complex biological system.
