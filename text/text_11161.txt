BACKGROUND
the correct estimation of the free energy of protein conformations has been the focus of intense research for over  <dig> years. despite recent improvements, this goal remains elusive. one important consequence of this is the limited ability to judge the quality of protein models built by homology or "ab initio". in particular, the estimators need to be accurate enough to help in the selection of the most native-like model from an ensemble of closely related alternative conformations. this has been recently identified as one of the bottlenecks limiting the quality and usefulness of protein structure prediction  <cit> .

free energy estimators can be broadly divided in two different classes: physical effective energy functions based on physical potentials and database derived statistical effective energy functions. physical effective energy functions  for discrimination of native structures  <cit>  generally yield results comparable to statistical effective energy functions  based on the boltzmann hypothesis  <cit> . seefs are commonly formalized as sets of pairwise potentials of mean force  <cit> .

an intuitive test for a free energy estimator is the recognition of the native structure among a large number of well-constructed decoy structures. a number of standard decoy sets, consisting of the native structure plus a large ensemble of more or less incorrect models resembling real protein structures, have been established for benchmarking purposes  <cit> . the method used for constructing the decoys, which are generally minimized using a simple energy function, introduces some systematic bias. it is therefore important to benchmark a scoring function on different decoy sets in order to assess its generality. as the results for any decoy set are known beforehand, this test does not prevent the scoring function from learning some hidden characteristics shared by all decoy structures, thus limiting its usefulness for practical purposes.

the presently available decoy sets are mainly, if not exclusively, built from "ab initio" models and contain structures which do not cover the full range of root mean square deviation  values, with respect to native structure. most structures, in particular for the older decoy sets, have high rmsd values and are obviously misfolded, limiting the usefulness of the decoy sets. moreover the simple energy functions used during decoy construction could also account for some systematic bias. for this reason, we have decided to derive a new pool of decoy structures from the snapshots of different trajectories from molecular dynamics simulations of villin headpiece thermostable domain. this new decoy set is evaluated using a battery of peefs and seefs to give a comparison of their relative performance.

villin headpiece thermostable domain is a small helical domain, folding on a microsecond time scale. for its limited size, its stability and for fast kinetics of folding it has served as a model for many theoretical studies. all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the villin headpiece thermostable domain have been performed by several groups using explicit solvent  <cit>  and implicit solvent  <cit> . although simulations were able to produce native-like conformations, the ability of free energy estimators to recognize native structures among all conformations seems rather limited. in a pioneering work kollman and coworkers were able to identify structures close to native based on mm/pbsa energy  <cit> . although molecular mechanics/implicit solvent methods are able to consistently assign low energy to native-like conformations  <cit> , their performance depends much on the force field used, the protocol applied and the solvation model adopted. in this context, the well-constructed native- and non-native-like decoys described in this paper will provide a further benchmark for refinement of free energy estimators.

since this work was started x-ray structures for mutants of the villin headpiece thermostable domain have been deposited in the protein data bank with pdb id.: 1yrf, 1yri, 1wy <dig>  1wy <dig>  <cit> . the rmsd of the trace of these newly deposited structures with respect to the average nmr structure used in the present work  is  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å. in general, the results discussed hereafter are essentially the same when any of the other structures deposited in the pdb is used as a reference. although there are differences among the nmr and x-ray structures  <cit>  all conclusions based on ranking of models according to cα trace rmsd from native are not significantly affected.

RESULTS
description of the decoy set
snapshots from the five long time molecular dynamics trajectories described by de mori et al.  <cit> , extended to  <dig> ns here, provide a set of conformations which span a large range of rmsds from native structures. the histogram of counts for each interval of  <dig>  Å is reported in figure  <dig> 

although the distribution is not uniform, samples are present for native- and non-native-like conformations. moreover, in one of the simulations  the peptide assumes a native-like conformation starting from a rather different conformation . snapshots taken at  <dig> ns intervals from native and f <dig> simulations have been superimposed on native structure in figure  <dig>  superposition of native snapshots on the starting native structure sets the overall limits for definining native-like conformations . it is evident from superposition of f <dig> snapshots on native structure that this set qualifies for being defined native-like.

the average radius of gyration of models in each f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> sets ranges from  <dig>  Å  to  <dig>  Å . these values are comparable with the average radius of gyration of models in the native set . all sets display, after initial collapse at the beginning of the simulation, rather compact structures, as witnessed also by the average solvent accessible surface areas  ranging from  <dig> Å <dig>  to  <dig> Å <dig> .

the breakdown of sasa in hydrophobic and polar contributions displays a more diverse behavior. native set has the lowest hydrophobic sasa and the lowest ratio of hydrophobic to polar sasa. among other sets f <dig> has the lowest hydrophobic sasa, while sets f <dig> and f <dig> show the highest ratio of hydrophobic to polar sasa.

the average number of residues involved in helical conformations has been also monitored for all sets. for native simulation the average number of residues in α- or 310-helices is dropping between  <dig> ns and  <dig> ns to reach an average value of ca.  <dig>  this number is comparable to the average number of helical residues in f <dig> and f <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, but definitely higher than the value of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. the average number of hydrogen bonds, however, is not very different among the sets, ranging from  <dig>  for f <dig> to  <dig>  for native.

the quality of structures can be assessed by subjecting the minimized structures to the program procheck  <cit>  which summarizes the analysis using so-called g-factors for the quality of dihedral angles, covalent geometry and overall quality of the structure.

few structures  had very high g-factors which appeared artifactual. these g-factors were reassigned as the average of the previous and next value in the time series. the average overall g-factor is - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig>  for the minimized structures of simulations native, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. the average g-factor for dihedral angles is - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig>  for the minimized structures of simulations native, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively. the average number of residues in generously allowed or disallowed regions is  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  for simulations native, f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig>  respectively.

it should be noted that conformations from native simulation and f <dig> simulation, folding to a native-like conformation, have higher  overall and dihedral g-factors than  conformations from simulations f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  this confirms that statistics of model dihedral angles and covalent structure may be an important value for quality model assessment as recently demonstrated  <cit> .

the data discussed in this section are summarized in table  <dig> 

in the following we examine the behaviour of seefs and peefs on pooled sets of conformations. we consider separately the set containing native snapshots and the set not containing native snapshots. the latter set does not contain any information about the native structure. it is homogeneous, in that all snapshots are obtained using the same procedure and it is representative of a realistic prediction scenario. on the other hand, including snapshots from native simulation allows one to access a lower range of rmsds from native, which is not available with snapshots from the other simulations.

the decoys arranged in five sets corresponding to the different molecular dynamics trajectories are available in the internet .

statistical effective energy functions
residue-residue mean contact energy
the contact energy computed according to the methodology of berrera et al.  <cit>  has been supplemented with a scoring function for the overall quality of the structure . the resulting potential allows to separate native and native-like f <dig> snapshots from non-native snapshots for most of the conformations.

g-factors  are necessary in order to take into account other factors which may raise the energy of a molecule. a few of these, like steric clashes and bad covalent geometry should be removed by molecular dynamics simulation and energy minimization, as performed here. on the contrary, unusual torsion angles are not necessarily removed both for the limited simulation time and for possible inaccuracies in available force fields.

the running average of the contact energy for simulations native and f <dig> is mostly separated from that of the other simulations, although the structure is rather flexible and fluctuations in the structure imply fluctuations in energy and in rmsd. based on this potential  a structure at rmsd of  <dig>  Å from native could be picked up as the lowest energy structure out of the four simulations f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> 

another way of looking at these results is to plot the energy versus the rmsd from native. this is done in figure  <dig> where the different simulations are roughly separated. the correlation between contact energy  and rmsd is apparent, although it is hidden by fluctuations. the appearance of the plot greatly improves when the running average of the contact energy is plotted against the rmsd of the structure at the center of the averaging window . this shows that even for such coarse grained potential averaging of fluctuations greatly improves the performance of the scoring function.

the contact energy is strongly correlated with the hydrophobic sasa. the correlation coefficient is  <dig>  much larger than the same coefficient for the polar sasa which is - <dig> . a similar positive correlation coefficient is found also within each different set of models, showing that this correlation is not artifactual . although this was somehow expected based on the table of pairwise residue-residue contact energies favoring contacts between hydrophobic resiudes, this correlation shows that a simple criterion like burial of hydrophobic sasa may be an effective feature in model quality assessment.

the correlation with helical content is less pronounced and largely artifactual because sets native, f <dig> and f <dig>  which have the lowest contact energy are also similar in helical content and quite different from sets f <dig> and f <dig>  when single sets are considered the correlation vanishes.

frst
the most striking feature of the frst energy appears to be the high energy fluctuation between closely related structures. this behaviour, which is more similar to peefs, is induced by the torsion angle term of the frst function. in order to pass from one local minimum to another, it appears necessary to overcome an energy barrier formed by distorsions in local geometry. this effect accounts for the better discrimination of the most native-like conformations in figure  <dig>  on the other hand it creates some noise in the energy evaluations for the simulations f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> in particular where frst has a slight preference for some higher rmsd structures. overall this seef is reliable at discriminating native-like conformations when at least some are present, but it is not as effective at choosing the less erroneous between those with high rmsd.

frst energy is not correlated with the sets features selected in table  <dig>  due to the above mentioned fluctuations in the energy. however, it is worth noting that the rapdf component of frst energy correlates well with the more coarse grained residue-residue contact energy .

physical effective energy functions
molecular mechanics  energy
it is instructive to consider the molecular mechanics energy because it shows how important solvation effects are. with no consideration of solvation effects the energies for all simulations are comparable. the plot of mm energy versus rmsd from native structures  shows no correlation. the best model that could be picked up from the sets of simulations f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig>  f <dig> has  <dig>  Å rmsd from native. when the average energies are considered, the best model has  <dig>  Å rmsd from native. fluctuations here are rather large, in the range of  <dig> kcal/mol. no native-like conformation from simulation f <dig> can be distinguished based on mm energy, as it could be expected.

molecular mechanics/poisson-boltzmann surface area  energy and molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area  energy
the performance of the scoring function drastically improves when solvation effects are added to the mm energy function either through the poisson-boltzmann model or through the generalized born solvent accessibility model. it is apparent that a procedure for smoothing fluctuations should be employed for better reliability. we have previously used the colony energy approach proposed by honig and co-workers  <cit>  coupled with mm/pbsa energy estimation  <cit>  and we showed that it could greatly improve the energy vs. rmsd curve for a small number of decoy sets. the peculiar nature of the structural models described here makes a simple running average procedure effective.

the mm/gbsa energy for native and folding simulation f <dig> is lower than for non-native simulations in a consistent portion of time. the plots of mm/pbsa and mm/gbsa energy versus rmsd from native structure display a very good correlation. this feature is better displayed in the mm/gbsa energy versus rmsd plot  rather than in the mm/pbsa plot . this is most probably due to the fact that the: i) structures are optimized using mm/gbsa energy and changing the solvation model for energy evaluation may introduce noise; ii) the mm/gbsa method does not suffer from all the numerical approximations implied by the numerical finite difference solution of the poisson-boltzmann equation. in this case the best model that could be picked up, based on the energy running average, from simulations starting from non native conformations has a rmsd from native structure of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for mm/pbsa and mm/gbsa energy model, respectively. it is worth noting that non-native models in the set f <dig> have even lower mm/pbsa energy than native-like models of set f <dig>  the running average favors native-like models by few tenths of kcal/mol, largely within the numerical inaccuracies of the methodology. both mm/gbsa and mm/pbsa energies anticorrelate with the burial of hydrophobic sasa. the correlation with the number of helical residues and number of hydrogen bonds is artifactual, as discussed above, and disappears when single sets are considered.

comparison of different effective energy functions
for the present decoy set native-like conformations may be conveniently defined in terms of the rmsd from native structure. the long time simulation of the native structure has an average rmsd compared to the deposited structure of  <dig>  Å ±  <dig>  Å with a maximum rmsd of  <dig>  Å. the latter could be arbitrarily defined as the rmsd for considering a structure native-like.

tables  <dig> and  <dig> report the performance of the seefs and peefs tested, evaluated with different criteria and according to the rmsd from native of the lowest energy model. two sets, alternatively including or not snapshots from native simulation, are considered and the energy or scoring function values are considered as they are or averaged over  <dig> continuous snapshots.

for the set with native simulation snapshots included, averaging improves significantly the performance of the frst scoring function and mm energy function. for the set not including native simulation snapshots, averaging improves significantly the performance of mm/gbsa and mm/pbsa energy functions which are known to be affected by large fluctuations .

for the set including native simulation snapshots the frst scoring function, mm/gbsa and mm/pbsa energy functions show the best performance and they all recognize native-like models with rmsd from native less than  <dig>  Å.

the poor performance of mm energy points out the need to consider solvation effects. for the set not including native simulation snapshots seefs appear superior to peefs. averaging makes mm/gbsa and mm/pbsa more effective while it worsens the performance of atom-based frst scoring function. the sensitivity of frst to molecular details is greater than that of the residue-based contact energy  <cit>  for which, indeed, averaging has an overall beneficial effect.

since frst is trained on native structures it is likely that while assigning low scores to native features, it assigns exceedingly bad scores to non-native-like features. this would explain the effect of averaging the score over closely related structures. overall from the set not including native simulation snapshots it is seen that most methods are able to detect models with reasonably low rmsd from native .

CONCLUSIONS
the decoy set presented here displays features which make it attractive for testing energy scoring functions:

1) it covers a broad range of rmsd values ;

2) it has been obtained from molecular dynamics trajectories, starting from native and different non-native conformations which have diverse behaviour, with secondary structure elements correctly or incorrectly formed, and in one case folding to a native-like structure. this allows not only for scoring of static structures, but also for studying, using free energy estimators, the kinetics of folding;

3) all structures have been obtained from accurate md simulations in explicit solvent and after molecular mechanics  energy minimization using an implicit solvent method. the quality of the covalent structure therefore does not suffer from major steric or covalent problems.

different free energy or scoring functions have been tested on the sets. the performance of seefs and peefs depends strongly on the decoy set. here we have a decoy set with native, native-like and non-native structures. the set not including decoys from the native trajectory is representative of a realistic prediction scenario. moreover a simple running averaging procedure can be employed in order to smooth free energy fluctuations, because decoys are obtained by sequential sampling of molecular dynamics trajectory. these features are not common for decoy sets.

the performance of free energy estimators may be assessed therefore in different contexts: 1) when snapshots from native simulation are included in the set; 2) when only snapshots from simulations starting from non-native conformations are included in the set.

moreover the effect of averaging may be easily assessed.

when native structures are included in the set, i.e., when the set includes models very close to native structure, atom based energy functions perform very well. the atom-based frst seef compares well with atom-based mm/pbsa and mm/gbsa peefs.

when snapshots from native simulation are not included in the set, the performance of residue based seef less sensitive to molecular details improves over atom-based seef and peefs. for mm/gbsa and mm/pbsa averaging has a beneficial effect being able to smooth large fluctuations expected in the methodology. the effect of averaging on frst seef is dominated by relatively poor discriminative power on non-native free energy.

overall these results suggest that different free energy estimators, possibly in a hierarchical scheme, should be used depending on the expected quality of predictive models. application of some form of averaging in order to smooth fluctuations due to molecular details, should be considered carefully depending on the energy function employed.
