BACKGROUND
plants in the brassica genus display extreme morphological diversity, from cauliflower and broccoli through cabbages and brussels sprouts to turnips and oil crops. almost all organs are used for consumption: heads of cabbages and leaves on non-heading vegetable types, inflorescences of cauliflowers, tuberized stems/hypocotyls and/or roots of kohlrabi’s, turnips and swede and enlarged seeds and seedpods of oil types. one of the most important brassica species, brassica rapa, also shows this extreme morphological divergence, likely selected for by plant breeders all over the world, with heading and non-heading leafy crops, turnips and both annual and biannual oil crops.

next to its economic value, b. rapa is also of particular interest in the study of genome evolution, because of its recent genome triplication after divergence from the common ancestor of arabidopsis and brassica  <cit> . the genome sequence of the mesopolyploid crop species b. rapa ssp. pekinesis chiifu, a chinese cabbage, was published in  <dig> as the first b. rapa reference genome  <cit> . interestingly, most retained paralogous genes in this genome still show higher similarity to each other than to their orthologs in a. thaliana. comparative mapping studies identified a putative ancestral karyotype of the current arabidopsis and brassica genomes, with  <dig> conserved chromosomal blocks, as well as an on-going process of biased gene loss called gene fractionation in three subgenomes of b. rapa <cit> . these subgenomes have been reconstructed by grouping the  <dig> conserved blocks: the least fractionated subgenome , with the highest gene densities; the medium fractionated subgenome , with moderate gene densities; and the most fractionated subgenome , with the lowest gene densities  <cit> .

our main research goal is to understand the genetic drivers underlying the enormous morphological variation between b. rapa subspecies. in this study, we therefore consider two b. rapa genomes – those of a vegetable turnip double haploid line  and a rapid cycling inbred line  – as representatives of the very distinct morphotypes turnip and annual oil . the vegetable turnip has an enlarged hypocotyl/root, whereas the rapid cycling line is developed in wisconsin by intercrossing mainly annual oils and pakchois/caixins and selecting for earliness in flowering  <cit> . as recent studies suggested that the genome-wide density of variants is much higher between accessions of one plant species than between lines in one mammalian species, in this study we not only resequenced the turnip and rapid cycling line genomes, but also assembled and re-annotated them, resulting in two new reference genomes .figure  <dig>

plants. left: the chinese cabbage cultivar, chiifu; middle: an oil-like rapid cycling line ; right: japanese vegetable turnip .



these two new genomes were combined with the reference chiifu genome  to form an initial b. rapa pan-genome. this concept was raised first in the study of bacterial species, to define the full complement of genes of several closely related strains  <cit> . in a pan-genome, we can distinguish common genes, present in all accessions of a species; dispensable genes, occurring in more than one genome; and unique genes, specific to a single genome  <cit> . in the b. rapa pan-genome, we find such genes and explore functional annotations of the unique gene set to find morphotype-specific genes. we also analyze the orthology of genes in the pan-genome to arabidopsis thaliana and thellungiella halophila to find lost genes  and retained genes  . finally, using orthologous genes we estimate the divergence date of the three b. rapa species and find that it far precedes domestication. the two newly assembled and annotated genomes are available to the community as an online resource at http://www.bioinformatics.nl/brassica/turnip and http://www.bioinformatics.nl/brassica/rapid-cycling, accompanied by the tools developed to explore the pan-genome.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
maker re-annotation of the reference genome chiifu
to get a comparable genome annotation for all three b. rapa species, we first re-annotated the chiifu reference genome using maker  <cit> . this re-annotation covered about 85% of the original  <dig>  gene models found in the brassica database , resulting in  <dig>  gene models of which  <dig>  were novel predictions   <cit> . the re-annotation covered about 90% of the exons from the brassica database . the remaining  <dig>  exons, roughly 10%, were mainly  located in low complexity regions of the genome. as expected, when we decreased the minimum overlap required for matching gene models, the number of recovered gene models increased: only five genes with short lengths  were still missing if the minimum overlap required was 10%. approximately 75% of re-annotated gene models could be assigned a gene ontology term  <cit> .table  <dig>

four different minimum overlap requirements  used to compare two gene models at both gene level and exon level. the brad_only and maker_only columns represent features found only in the reference gene model and maker generated gene model respectively. intersections between two gene models mainly include the fraction overlap reciprocal for both , overlaps that split one reference feature to many maker features  or join many reference features to one maker feature .

genomic variation between the chinese cabbage, turnip and rapid cycling genotypes
within a species, the genomic variation between subspecies can vary substantially, as shown in several published intra-species comparative genomic studies  <cit> . we mapped the turnip and rapid cycling resequenced genomes to the reference chiifu genome and identified  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> genomic variants respectively . this is less variation than between pairs of a. thaliana accessions  <cit> . there are  <dig>  genomic variations common relative to the reference chiifu genome ,  <dig>  genomic variations only found between turnip and chiifu and  <dig>  genomic variations only found between rapid cycling and chiifu. only  <dig>  genomic variations  are unique, i.e. differ between all three  sequenced genomes.figure  <dig>

re-annotation of turnip and rapid cycling
the genome sequences of turnip and rapid cycling were reconstructed by applying all genomic variation found to the reference genome. the total lengths of both resulting genomes were almost the same as that of the reference genome :  <dig>  mbs for turnip and  <dig>  mbs for rapid cycling. before re-annotation of the reference genomes, nearly half of its gene models appeared to be affected by changes in the protein coding region in either turnip  or rapid cycling  with moderate to high impact  <cit>  . re-annotation of the turnip and rapid cycling genomes resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  predicted gene models respectively, slightly below the number found in the reference genome . after re-annotation, the number of genes found in the turnip and rapid cycling genomes which changed function or became pseudogenes with respect to the chiifu genome was only  <dig>  resp.  <dig>  .figure  <dig> 
number of genes predicted to be functionally affected by genomic variants. before annotation, genes were considered functionally affected in the rapid cycling line or in turnip when one of the following variants was found w.r.t. the chiifu genome: splice_site_acceptor, splice_site_donor, start_lost, exon_deleted, frame_shift, stop_gained or stop_lost. genes were considered affected if they had no orthologous gene at the same chromosome/scaffold of chiifu genome after its re-annotation.



pan-genome construction and detection of retained and lost genes
most of the genomic variation maps to intergenic regions, followed by introns, exons and utrs . after re-annotation of the rapid cycling and turnip genomes,  <dig>  genes are found to be common, i.e. present in all three genomes  while  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes are unique to turnip, rapid cycling and chiifu respectively . functional annotation of these genes resulted in  <dig>  gene ontology  assignments to  <dig>  genes .table  <dig>

pan-genome composition. there are  <dig>  genes classified as common in the b. rapa pan genome; the number of unique genes was  <dig>  in chiifu,  <dig>  in turnip and  <dig>  in rapid cycling.



in total, we thus found  <dig>  unique genes, found in only one of the three genomes; all remaining non-unique, non-common genes we called dispensable. about  <dig>  out of  <dig>  unique and dispensable genes in turnip could be annotated with at least one go term, as was the case for  <dig>  out of  <dig>  genes in rapid cycling and  <dig>  out of  <dig>  in chiifu. most of these genes were assigned to only ten biological process go terms, seven of which were common to the three genomes . gene models predicted from contigs that could not be mapped against the chiifu genome were annotated separately. the number of genes thus found with at least one go term annotation was  <dig> for the turnip genome and  <dig> for the rapid cycling genome . most unique and dispensable genes mapped to the lf subgenome, the least mapped to the mf <dig> subgenome. corrected for total gene count, the proportion of genes affected by changes to their protein coding region is lowest in the lf subgenome .table  <dig>

only dispensable and unique genes were included in the analysis. the term “response to stress” is the most over-represented and seven out of these ten go terms are found in chiifu, turnip as well as rapid cycling.

to study gene copy number variation in the b. rapa pan-genome, orthology between genes in b. rapa and its close relatives arabidopsis thaliana and thellungiella halophila was computed. for the common gene set we found  <dig>  orthologs in a. thaliana and  <dig>  in t. halophile. the numbers of genes with one, two or three orthologous genes in b. rapa were  <dig> / <dig> / <dig> in a. thaliana and  <dig> / <dig> / <dig> in t. halophila . further analysis of the b. rapa dispensable and unique genes with orthologous genes in either a. thaliana or t. halophila showed that the rapid cycling line and turnip dh line had over 40% resp. 30% less retained genes w.r.t. a. thaliana than chiifu, yet an approximately equal number of lost genes .table  <dig>

functional annotation of dispensable and unique genes in the chiifu, turnip and rapid cycling genomes
the unique and dispensable genes can be placed in  <dig> kegg pathways in turnip,  <dig> in rapid cycling and  <dig> in chiifu, with starch and sucrose metabolism containing the largest proportion of genes   <cit> . these genes are also found in  <dig>   <dig> resp.  <dig> plant-specific pathways hosted by the plant metabolic network in plantcyc  <cit> . genes are much more scattered over different metabolic pathways in plantcyc than in kegg  <cit> . the number of genes found in any pathway in plantcyc  is less than half of the number of genes found in kegg  since fewer enzymes are associated with each plantcyc metabolic pathway .

go enrichment analysis shows that the dispensable and unique genes in chiifu have both the most overrepresented  and underrepresented  go terms, while the dispensable and unique genes in rapid cycling have the least overrepresented  and underrepresented  terms and turnip has  <dig> overrepresented and  <dig> underrepresented terms. the number of genes assigned to enriched go terms is higher in turnip  than in chiifu  and rapid cycling .

genes with association to different morphotypes
next, we specifically looked for genes potentially related to morphological variation, by considering retained and lost genes with orthologs in both a. thaliana and t. halophila. only a small percentage of these, 15% of the retained and 10% of the lost genes, could be categorized into known a. thaliana gene families . the set of unique and dispensable genes found in turnip is enriched for the go cellular component term “peroxisome”, and contains class iii peroxidases among both lost  and retained  genes. to refine our understanding of a possible role of peroxidases in turnip formation, we more closely investigated b. rapa genes orthologous to  <dig> peroxidase related genes in a. thaliana <cit> . we exploited synteny information to support the confidence in orthology predictions and to help distinguishing true orthologs, since a. thaliana and b. rapa are evolutionary very close  <cit> . b. rapa orthologs of five a. thaliana genes were retained and of four a. thaliana genes were lost in turnip compared to chiifu and rapid cycling . we found proteins functionally interacting with these genes using string   <cit> . four of the five retained genes were involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and the fifth, at3g <dig> , a glutathione peroxidase, may contribute to glutathione synthesis. only one of the four a. thaliana orthologs of the lost genes, at5g <dig> , was predicted to interact with other proteins in string, whereas both per <dig> and another lost gene at1g <dig>  are also involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. we then examined all genes known to be involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway in a. thaliana and found that while orthologs of genes encoding a peroxidase  were enriched in turnip, genes encoding a 4-coumarate-coa ligase  or a coniferyl-alcohol glucosyltransferase  were underrepresented. the six a. thaliana genes encoding this ligase have ten orthologs in the common gene set of b. rapa, but only two b. rapa genes are orthologous to three a. thaliana genes coding for the glucosyltransferase. this suggests the lower copy number of genes in turnip coding for the glucosyltransferase may cause the reduction of 4-d-glucoside, coniferin, syringin and hence increase the production of different lignins .table  <dig>

discussion
variability in the b. rapa pan-genome
the three b. rapa genomes considered in this work – chiifu, turnip and rapid cycling – differ by about  <dig>  per  <dig> base pairs, considerably less than the differences between lines of maize  but very close to differences between various accessions of a. thaliana  and of rice   <cit> . to further investigate the pan-genomic variation, we focused on the unique genes, on average  <dig>  per b. rapa genome. the frequency of functional unique genes over the three subgenomes agrees with the theory that one of the subgenomes  is dominant and hence has the lowest percentage of affected genes .

we expected the number of unique genes in each b. rapa genome to be larger than the average number of unique genes found in different a. thaliana accessions, mainly because the morphological variation between a tuber forming turnip, a heading cabbage and an oilseed rapid cycling is larger than between, say, three a. thaliana accessions. additionally, the recent genome triplication in b. rapa may have lowered selective pressure on a subset of the genes. however, a recent study analyzing  <dig> a. thaliana accessions found only  <dig> unique genes per accession on average. such a comparison is not completely fair however, as the a. thaliana comparisons used a different definition of unique gene. we thus selected the three a. thaliana accessions  with the highest number of genes with predicted major disruptions, and used the protein sequences of their gene models to find unique genes by exactly the same process as in our study. this yielded on average  <dig>  unique genes, higher than the  <dig>  found in the b. rapa genomes. one explanation may be that the effective population size is much higher for a. thaliana than for b. rapa, which went through several domestication bottlenecks. additionally, the three b. rapa genotypes are all landraces  growing in protected agricultural settings, with varieties selected by breeders and farmers, while a. thaliana is a weed that grows in natural environments under diverse abiotic and biotic stresses  with different selection forces.

our findings are also in line with a previous study, in which the genetic variation in a b. rapa core collection representing all morphotypes and geographical origins was analyzed based on molecular marker profiles  <cit> . bayesian clustering implemented in the structure software revealed four subpopulations, each representing different morphotypes . amova results indicated that the percentage of variation found within sub-populations/morphotypes is much larger  than the variation among populations , suggesting that only a small percentage of the polymorphisms relate to the sepcific observed morphological differences.

genomic determinants of morphological variation
studying the functions of unique and dispensable genes could reveal whether they play a role in the extreme morphological differences between the three plants. through functional annotation, we found that peroxidases are good candidates for genes involved in the definition of plant morphology. peroxidases play a role in protection from biotic and abiotic stresses, but also in lignin formation. four of five turnip specific retained b. rapa genes orthologous to a. thaliana peroxidases are involved in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway. phenylpropanoids are a group of plant secondary metabolites and specific compounds differentially accumulate in particular tissues with specialized functions. these results suggest that lignin may be important for turnip tuber formation, which can relate to the increased numbers of xylem vessels in the turnip tuber.

in this paper we focus on the dna level, but it is entirely possible that turnip formation is  regulated at the transcriptional or even post-translational level. gene loss occurred more in rapid cycling than in turnip and chiifu . rapid cycling may have a different composition of flowering time genes because it was generated by crossing early flowering b. rapa genotypes to create a morphotype with a short life cycle for educational purposes  <cit> . to verify this hypothesis, we looked for genes in the three b. rapa genomes orthologous to  <dig> known flowering related a. thaliana genes. these flowering genes were classified into five different categories, including flower development, gibberellin-, photoperiod/circadian rhythm- and vernalization pathway and metabolic processes . in rapid cycling, there are five lost genes related to flowering time , compared to only three in chiifu and turnip  .table  <dig>

b. rapa
genotypes


five lost genes are related to flowering time in rapid cycling, covering all five categories of lowering time genes. in the other genomes just three genes are found, related only to photoperiod in turnip and vernalization in chiifu.



evolutionary divergence
chiifu, rapid cycling and turnip are estimated to have diverged  <dig>  years ago, far preceding domestication . this may seem to imply that prior to domestication there was already considerably divergence among b. rapa genomes; however, domestication can accelerate selection and hence influence divergence time estimates. we do not know whether there was already variation in appearance, such as enlarged hypocotyls, leaves that form heads, multi tillering types etc. prior to domestication, or whether  there was a common wild type, and that breeders merely combined mutations and allelic variation by crossing which gave rise to diverse morphotypes. it is also unknown whether early plant breeders could breed for all different morphotypes starting from the same genetic materials, or that specific b. rapa materials  resulted in certain morphotypes. resequencing more b. rapa genotypes belonging to turnip, leafy and oil types, especially from diverse geographical regions  may shed light on these questions.the percentage of b.rapa genes that have orthologs in t. halophila is higher than the percentage with orthologs in a. thaliana. the divergence date of a. thaliana and b. rapa is estimated at  <dig> mya, earlier than that of t. halophila and b. rapa at  <dig> mya and earlier than the whole genome triplication event dated 5– <dig> mya, after speciation of a. thaliana/b. rapa and t. halophila/b. rapa <cit> . in other words, b. rapa genes are expected to be more similar to t. halophila genes than to a. thaliana genes.

computational analysis
as practical considerations make it hard to obtain the sequencing depth required for de novo genome assembly, in this work we took a hybrid approach in which we first mapped reads to a reference genome and then created new genomes by applying all variation found. the trade-off between the number of detected variants and mapping accuracy is important. a low mapping quality threshold setting leads to many candidate genes for further experimental validation, but can also introduce false positive discoveries.

for the purposes of this study, we developed a number of scripts for variant calling, re-annotation and functional annotation that can help biologists to answer similar questions on genotype-phenotype relations. the re-annotation is a particulary time-consuming step, which may be extended by considering rna-seq data or available gene model gff and fasta files.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present two novel reference genomes and their annotations representing the morphotypes turnip and rapid cycling to the b. rapa community, which provides reliable templates for studying genetic variation between these two morphotypes and the reference, chiifu. in addition, this paper offers a complete workflow for those having limited computational resources and bioinformatics expertise studying similar biological questions. we investigated the resulting b. rapa pan-genome, paying specific attention to potential drivers of morphological variation. the number of genes with protein-coding changes among the three b. rapa genomes was lower than that among three diverse accessions of arabidopsis thaliana. we found peroxidases, mainly involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, enriched in the genes retained in turnip. analysis of the gene content of the b. rapa pan-genome revealed that the divergence date between the three morphotypes was dated long before domestication .
