BACKGROUND
the biology of the transcription factor yin yang  <dig>  is not well characterized yet, but may be of particular interest due to its similarities to the ubiquitously expressed yy <dig>  which has been implicated in fundamental biological processes such as dna-replication, cell cycle regulation and organogenesis  <cit> . yy <dig> is a zinc finger protein that shares 56% sequence homology with yy <dig>  <cit> . especially, the c-terminal dna-binding zinc finger is highly conserved  <cit>  and mediates a similar binding specificity to the 5'-natg-3' dna consensus motif  <cit> , suggesting synergistic or competitive functions, if both factors act within the same cell  <cit> . the biological significance of yy <dig> is highlighted by early embryonic lethality of mice with homozygous yy <dig> deletion. in addition, mice with heterozygous yy <dig> ablation show growth retardation and defects in neurulation  <cit> .

analysis of yy <dig> ablation has not been reported, yet. the intron lacking yy <dig> gene is extraordinarily positioned between exons  <dig> and  <dig> of another x-chromosomally located gene encoding mbtps <dig> . first expression analyses by in situ hybridization in testis, ovaries and brain from adult mice suggested a shared control of yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> gene activities  <cit> . however, our data indicate that the upstream region of the human yy <dig> gene mediates significant promoter activity independently from mbtps <dig>  <cit> .

to gain more information on the biology of yy <dig>  we established whole mount in situ hybridization. in parallel, real-time pcr was used to quantify yy <dig> mrna expression in various organs of developing and adult mice more precisely. herein, we demonstrate that the yy <dig> mrna expression pattern differs from that of yy <dig> and mbtsp <dig>  importantly, yy <dig> expression underlies significant changes during development, particularly in various areas of the brain.

RESULTS
expression of yy <dig> in mouse embryos
since there are only limited data available on the organ-specific yy <dig> expression  <cit> , we established the whole mount in situ hybridization technique. first experiments with dig-labeled riboprobes showed wide spread signals of yy <dig> transcripts on the entire e <dig>  embryo , suggesting ubiquitous expression similar as described for yy <dig>  <cit> . the specificity of the antisense riboprobe staining is underlined by the negative control, where the embryo was incubated with the corresponding sense riboprobe . to analyze the yy <dig> expression pattern more precisely, we subsequently performed taqman real-time pcr in selected organs and tissue specimens of developing and adult mice.

quantitative analysis of yy <dig> expression in heart and lung
specimens of the heart and lung, taken at several developmental stages, were dissected, and cdnas were amplified out of isolated rna. we analyzed samples spanning from e <dig> to p <dig>  since in earlier developmental stage region-specific specimens cannot be isolated due to technical limitations. by using taqman real-time pcr technique with fam-labeled probes, we tested the specimens also for yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> transcripts. for all three transcripts we found almost stable expression level throughout all tested developmental stages of the heart  and lung . however, in contrast to the highly expressed yy <dig>  the amount of yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> transcripts was clearly lower in all developmental stages. interestingly, yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> showed always similar expression levels. thus, neither the yy genes nor mbtps <dig> showed any significant changes in expression during heart and lung development.

quantitative analysis of yy <dig> expression in the brain
previously, the expression of yy <dig>  yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> in the neocortex and cerebellum of adult mice has been shown by in situ hybridization, but not quantified  <cit> . to analyze the gene expression during development we used the quantitative real-time pcr technique. as shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  there were significant changes of yy <dig> expression from day e <dig> to p <dig> by means of taqman real-time pcr. by contrast, the yy <dig> levels remained stable. interestingly, in cerebellum the amount of yy <dig> increased up to 6-fold with maturation. in the neocortex yy <dig> expression significantly decreased during intrauterine gestation, reached a minimum in the early neonatal period, before it increased again in adult mice . however, the content of yy <dig> transcripts in the hippocampus remained stable on a lower level compared to those of cerebellum and neocortex . in all brain regions, mbtps <dig> and yy <dig> were consistently higher expressed  than yy <dig>  in contrast to yy <dig>  transcripts of yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> were almost constitutively expressed during development. the combined data indicate that yy <dig> expression underlies a tissue- and developmental-stage specific regulation.

quantitative analysis of yy <dig> expression in neurons, astrocytes and microglia
due to the dynamic regulation of yy <dig> expression in neocortex and cerebellum, we analyzed the expression of yy <dig>  yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> transcript levels in primary neurons, astrocytes and microglia of mice by using real-time pcr. as depicted in figure  <dig>  yy <dig> was strongly expressed at similar levels within all three cell types, whereas yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> were found at lower levels. especially neurons contained a very low amount of yy <dig> transcript, if compared to astrocytes and microglia cells .

discussion
herein, for the first time we provide data implying that the transcription factor yy <dig> possess a functional role during development, as it has already been shown for its famous and well characterized homologue yy <dig>  <cit> . since, yy <dig> is broadly, possibly ubiquitously expressed in embryonic mice , we conducted extensive real-time pcr analyses indicating a tissue-specific expression pattern that is in part developmentally regulated. thereby, our experiments were especially focused on the cardiopulmonary and central nervous system.

expression of yy <dig>  yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> could be detected in all analyzed organs, tissues and cells . while their expression levels did not change significantly during development of heart and lung, the specimens from the brain revealed a more dynamic expression pattern. the relative high amount of yy <dig> transcripts in the cerebellum, neocortex and hippocampus underlines the broad implication of yy <dig> in the brain at all stages of mice development  <cit> . in fact, its functional role in the nervous system has been demonstrated by analyses of heterozygous yy <dig> knock-out mice  <cit>  and conditional ablation of yy <dig> in oligodendrocytes  <cit> . by contrast, the amount of yy <dig> showed tissue-specific variations throughout brain development . in the cerebellum, yy <dig> expression increased significantly from early postnatal to adult. during this time period cerebellum undergoes dramatic morphological changes, including active neurogenesis, neuronal migration and differentiation  <cit> . in cortical samples yy <dig> expression revealed a u-shaped progression with a minimum starting at birth. at this time point neurogenesis and neuronal migration are completed in the cortex  <cit> . here, it has to be noted that cerebellum and cortex have specific parallel neuronal connections between each other  <cit> . for example, neurons from the motor cortex project to the cerebellum. the hippocampus, however, involved in learning and memory processes, exhibited a constant low level of yy <dig> transcripts throughout development. further analyses of yy <dig> protein localization at the cellular level could help to understand whether yy <dig> could be involved in controlling axon formation, migration, or dendritogenesis. this issue cannot be examined so far, because currently no appropriate antibody against murine yy <dig> is available.

by analyzing different primary cell types isolated from the murine brain, we found differences of yy <dig> expression as well, whereas yy <dig> levels showed no significant changes. in contrast to microglia cells and astrocytes, neurons express almost no yy <dig>  the neuronal data suggest that yy <dig> could be required for proliferation, since neurons, in contrast to astrocytes and microglia cells, cannot divide anymore. ongoing experiments may verify this hypothesis.

comparing all real-time pcr results it becomes obvious that the expression of yy <dig> and mbtps <dig>  respectively, is individually regulated depending upon the analyzed organ, tissue or cell type. while both genes seem to be co-regulated via the same promoter in heart and lung as well as in microglia and astrocytes, however, the data from primary neurons and all three brain tissues indicate an alternative transcriptional activity. currently, two different possibilities of yy <dig> and mbtps <dig> gene regulation are discussed:  both genes are under the control of the mbtps <dig> promoter, and  yy <dig> transcription is mediated by its own adjacent promoter, located upstream of its coding sequence, a model that we favour according to own data on the regulation of the human yy <dig> gene  <cit> . of note, only the yy <dig> promoter shows a significant sensitivity against dna-methylation, strengthening the implication of yy <dig> in developmental processes. our observations presented in this manuscript emphasize that in fact both promoter regions seem to be utilized in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner.

CONCLUSIONS
the results from the real-time pcr experiments confirm that yy <dig> is differentially expressed in the lung, heart and brain, indicating a stringent spatial regulation and function. precisely, we show a significant change of yy <dig> expression during the development and maturation of the neocortex and cerebellum. within the central nervous system, yy <dig> is predominantly expressed in astrocytes and microglia cells.
