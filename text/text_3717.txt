BACKGROUND
ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase   is limited by a low carboxylation rate and competing oxygenase activity that initiates a wasteful photorespiratory pathway leading to the loss of fixed carbon  <cit> . the co2/o <dig> specificity  of rubisco is equal to the ratio of catalytic efficiencies  for carboxylation  to oxygenation vo/ko  <cit> . net photosynthetic co <dig> fixation would be increased if rubisco could work faster with greater specificity for co <dig>  <cit> . because there is natural variation in rubisco kinetic constants  <cit> , it may be possible to develop genetic engineering strategies aimed at improving the enzyme by focusing on regions responsible for this variation.

the green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an excellent model for studying plant-like rubisco enzymes comprised of eight large subunits  and eight small subunits   <cit> . mutants that lack rubisco function can be maintained with acetate, and both the nuclear rbcs and chloroplast rbcl genes are amenable to transformation  <cit> . because chlamydomonas rubisco has a faster carboxylation rate and lower Ω value than rubisco enzymes of flowering plants  <cit> , but shares ~90% sequence identity with flowering-plant enzymes, a phylogenetic approach has been initiated to define the structural basis for differences in catalysis  <cit> . there are only  <dig> residues in the chlamydomonas large subunit that differ from those of  <dig> flowering-plant sequences  <cit> . changing five of these "phylogenetic" residues to those common to flowering plants, and introducing a spinach small-subunit loop, produced a chlamydomonas rubisco enzyme with catalytic properties more like those of flowering plants than chlamydomonas, including a 12–17% increase in Ω  <cit> . however, because the Ω value was not identical to that of flowering-plant rubisco, there must be other residues that also contribute to the differences in rubisco catalytic properties.

the loop between β-strand  <dig> and α-helix  <dig> of the large-subunit α/β barrel folds over the transition-state analog carboxyarabinitol  <dig> -bisphosphate   <cit>  . in this closed conformation, the large-subunit carboxy terminus  packs over loop  <dig>   <cit> . in chlamydomonas rubisco, substitution of conserved asp- <dig>  which was proposed to be an essential latch residue  <cit> , with either ala or glu did not eliminate catalysis but caused a 14–17% decrease in Ω  <cit> . deletion of  <dig> residues from the carboxy terminus of the synechococcus  large subunit caused a 38% decrease in Ω, and a group of four plant-like substitutions e470p/t471a/k474t/l475v was reported to cause a 9% increase in Ω  <cit> . however, this small increase was close to the experimental error of the assays employed  <cit> . lengthening the carboxy terminus beyond residue  <dig> had no effect on Ω  <cit> .

the chlamydomonas carboxy-terminal residues asp- <dig>  thr- <dig>  ile- <dig>  and lys- <dig> comprise a set of previously identified "phylogenetic" residues   <cit>  that differ from the set common to flowering plants . the carboxy terminal residues of synechococcus, studied previously  <cit> , comprise a somewhat different set of residues  relative to those of flowering plants . therefore, the carboxy terminus of chlamydomonas was changed via directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation to that of spinach rubisco  to see whether the catalytic properties common to rubisco of flowering plants might be obtained.

RESULTS
recovery and phenotype of the mutant strain
the residues equivalent to chlamydomonas asp- <dig>  thr- <dig>  ile- <dig>  and lys- <dig> are glu, ala, met, and thr, respectively, in most flowering-plant sequences  <cit> . the carboxy terminus of the spinach large subunit is identical in length to that of chlamydomonas, and the availability of the spinach crystal structure  <cit>  allows structural comparison . however, whereas most plant rubisco enzymes contain a glu at position  <dig>  this residue is a pro in spinach rubisco. thus, a chlamydomonas d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t mutant enzyme was created to mimic the large-subunit carboxy terminus of spinach rubisco.

when the rbcl-deletion mutant mx <dig> was transformed with the rbcl-d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t gene, photosynthesis-competent colonies were recovered. thus, the substituted residues are not essential for rubisco expression, assembly, or function in vivo. furthermore, the mutant strain was indistinguishable from wild type with respect to growth at either  <dig> or 35°c, eliminating the possibility that the mutant is temperature conditional   <cit> .

mutant rubisco holoenzyme stability
to assess the effect of the mutant substitutions on holoenzyme levels in vivo, protein extract was subjected to sds-page and western-blot analysis. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple-mutant strain contains wild-type levels of rubisco subunits. a wild-type level of holoenzyme could also be purified from the quadruple mutant when cell extract was fractionated on a sucrose-density gradient . no difference was detected between the mutant and wild-type enzymes when thermal stability experiments were performed in vitro . thus, analysis of the catalytic properties of the quadruple-mutant enzyme would not be expected to be influenced by structural instability during the assays.

kinetic properties of the quadruple-mutant enzyme
to determine whether the spinach-like substitutions can confer catalytic properties mimicking those of the spinach enzyme, kinetic constants were determined for the purified mutant enzyme . the Ω value of the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple-mutant rubisco enzyme is 10% higher than that of the wild-type chlamydomonas enzyme. nonetheless, this value is still 17% lower than that of spinach rubisco . although the Ω value appears to be altered in the correct direction, the other kinetic constants remain quite different from those of spinach rubisco . the increase in Ω is likely the consequence of an increase in ko/kc . due to an apparent decrease in vc/kc, the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple-mutant enzyme would not be a "better" rubisco  <cit> .

discussion
substitution of the chlamydomonas carboxy-terminal residues with those of spinach, to produce the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple-mutant enzyme, causes a 10% increase in Ω, but the other kinetic constants are not like those of spinach rubisco . thus, these engineered "phylogenetic" residues  <cit>  do not by themselves account for the differences in catalysis between chlamydomonas and spinach rubisco. however, there should be other residues in the spinach enzyme that complement for the lower values of kc and ko . residue  <dig>  is a "phylogenetic" residue in the loop  <dig>  which is in van der waals contact with the conserved asp- <dig> of the carboxy terminus . another divergent residue, arg- <dig>  is also involved in van der waals contact with the carboxy terminus. the analogous lys- <dig> of the spinach enzyme interacts with the carboxy terminus via a single hydrogen-bond  and a p305k substitution in chromatium vinosum rubisco causes an 80% increase in carboxylation catalytic efficiency  <cit> . it is thus likely that the addition of v341i and r305k substitutions to the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple mutant would confer kinetic constants that are more like the flowering-plant enzymes.

engineering of synechococcus rubisco to produce an e470p/t471a/k474t/l475v mutant enzyme with a spinach-like large-subunit carboxy terminus may also have resulted in a similar, relative increase in Ω  <cit> , but the Ω value of that mutant synechococcus enzyme is still ~10% lower than the Ω value of the chlamydomonas quadruple-mutant enzyme analyzed in the present study. variation in amino-acid identities at residues  <dig> and  <dig> may indicate that these residues are less important than the others. the loss of the e470-r <dig> and e470-k <dig> salt bridges in synechococcus rubisco  <cit>  and d470-r <dig> and d470-k <dig> salt bridges in chlamydomonas rubisco  <cit>   may be primarily responsible for the observed increases in Ω  <cit> .

in a recent study, a set of three "phylogenetic" substitutions in the chlamydomonas large subunit , which causes a 10% decrease in Ω  <cit> , was complemented by the addition of two large-subunit phylogenetic substitutions  and the loop that resides between β-strands a and b of the spinach small subunit  <cit> . the resultant penta/abso enzyme has a ~15% higher Ω value and all other catalytic properties similar to the spinach enzyme  <cit> . although the d470p/t471a/i472m/k474t quadruple-mutant enzyme, analyzed in the present study, does not have kinetic constants like those of spinach rubisco, it does have a 10% increase in Ω . if these carboxy-terminal substitutions could increase the Ω value of the penta/abso enzyme by 10% without substantially altering other kinetic constants, a chlamydomonas enzyme would be generated with kinetic properties indistinguishable from those of spinach rubisco  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
such combinatorial approaches may identify only a small number of regions responsible for the differences in kinetic properties between chlamydomonas and spinach rubisco. these regions may then serve as suitable targets for dna shuffling and genetic selection aimed at improving rubisco  <cit> .
