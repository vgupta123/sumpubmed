BACKGROUND
according to evolutionary theories of aging, lifespan evolves as a trade-off between the metabolic costs of somatic maintenance with those of reproduction. reproductive processes such as egg production and progeny rearing are energy-intense and drain resources away from processes that promote somatic maintenance. studies have provided evidence for a trade-off between reproduction and survival. for example, experimentally increased egg production in wild seabirds is associated with lower rates of postmigratory return to breeding grounds  <cit> . one mechanism by which organisms can regulate the relative burdens of reproduction and somatic maintenance in response to environmental conditions is through phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits, such as growth and reproduction  <cit> . plasticity in life-history traits can affect lifespan directly, such as to delay reproduction until environmental conditions improve, or indirectly, as a consequence of elevated stress resistance.

one highly plastic reproductive process is vitellogenesis, the process of maternal yolk production that provides the major nutrient source for developing embryos. vitellogenin genes are expressed in adult females within tissues specialized for yolk production, such as the insect fat body and avian liver. vitellogenesis has been well-studied in birds and insects and is hormonally regulated in response to environmental conditions. in insects, vitellogenesis is induced by the coordinate action of 20-hydroxyecdysone and juvenile hormone . insect jh is regulated, in turn, by insulin-like signaling . eggs in drosophila insulin receptor mutants fail to become vitellogenic and this phenotype can be rescued by methoprene, a jh analog  <cit> . in aedes aegypti mosquitoes, vitellogenin gene expression is synergistically enhanced by ecdysone and insulin signaling, via the nutrient sensing protein, tor  <cit> .

iis is also required for vitellogenesis in c. elegans nematodes  <cit> . in c. elegans, iis is mediated by the insulin receptor-like protein , daf- <dig> which transduces signals via age-1/pi3k to antagonize the activity of daf- <dig>  a foxo transcription factor  <cit> . under conditions that reduce daf-2/ir signaling, levels of vit gene transcripts and yolk proteins  are both reduced  <cit> . in addition to suppressing vitellogenesis, defective iis prolongs adult lifespan in c. elegans and drosophila  <cit> . the mechanism by which iis modulates longevity is likely to be multifactorial and complex  <cit> . vitellogenesis appears to be one target of the iis prolongevity mechanism, possibly for the purpose of reallocating resources to somatic maintenance. consistently, rnai knockdown of vitellogenin gene expression could extend lifespan of wildtype adults  <cit> . fecundity has been linked to longevity in daf- <dig> mutants. sixteen daf- <dig> alleles were associated with reduced brood size at nonpermissive temperatures  <cit> . however, certain alleles, termed class  <dig>  had brood sizes ranging from 85-100% that of wildtype, while class  <dig> alleles had brood sizes ranging from 60-93% of wildtype. in insects, iis regulates vitellogenesis hormonally through jh. however, it is not known whether c. elegans iis also regulates vitellogenesis through hormonal effectors or by direct action in the intestine, the site of vitellogenin production.

to address this question, we identified factors modulating c. elegans vitellogenesis and then examined whether these factors were modified by iis or were iis-independent. the c. elegans genome contains six vitellogenin  genes. the genes, vit- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig>  all contribute to the pool of yp <dig>  the major yolk protein. vit- <dig> encodes a protein that is processed into yp <dig> and yp <dig>  our analyses show that iis stimulates vitellogenin gene transcription through a sperm-dependent signal, implying the existence of germline-dependent hormonal regulators of vitellogenesis in c. elegans. however, yolk protein levels correlated poorly with vit- <dig> mrna and were regulated by iis independently of sperm and nutrients. based on these findings, we propose that vit genes may be transcribed in excess and titrated to reflect reproductive needs. furthermore, iis deficits appear to suppress vitellogenesis convergently through germline-dependent transcriptional mechanisms and a separate posttranscriptional mechanism.

RESULTS
differential regulation of vit- <dig> transcription and translation
to measure vitellogenesis in c. elegans adult hermaphrodites, we examined vit mrna levels and yolk protein  levels. first, quantitative rt-pcr was used to determine levels of the vit transcripts contributing to the pool of yp <dig>  the major c. elegans yolk protein. we developed primer sets that specifically recognized vit- <dig> or vit- <dig>  but not vit- <dig>  - <dig> or - <dig>  which have very similar sequence. for simplicity, the term "vit" may be used to refer to vit-2/ <dig>  samples were collected at four time points across the adult reproductive period, between adult days  <dig> to  <dig>  in wildtype worms, the abundance of vit- <dig> and - <dig> transcripts declined progressively from adult days  <dig> to  <dig>  resulting in approximately 7-fold reduction over this period  . in comparison, absolute levels of act- <dig> mrna did not decline over this period, indicating that transcription was not globally reduced and these changes were relatively specific to vit genes  .

to determine the concordance between vit message and protein levels during this period, we also examined yolk proteins directly in wildtype hermaphrodites. yolk proteins  are the most abundant proteins in the worm and are easily detected in coomassie-stained crude lysates after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  <cit> . we confirmed the identities of bands corresponding to yp <dig>  yp <dig>  yp <dig>  actin  and myosin  by mass spectrometry. we quantified the levels of each protein by densitometry and calculated abundance relative to myosin, as an internal standard, as well as an independent loading standard run on the same gel. in contrast to the progressive decline observed for vit- <dig> and - <dig> transcripts, yp levels increased in abundance nearly 4-fold by adult day  <dig>  . actin levels did not change over this period. furthermore, the absolute levels of myosin relative to a loading standard were constant, showing there was no overall change in protein levels. rather, the increased level of yp <dig> reflected specific increases in this pool.

we next examined vit mrna levels in daf- <dig> mutant hermaphrodites. most daf- <dig> mutations prolong adult lifespan but have pleitropic effects on other adult processes. the class  <dig> daf- <dig> mutation extends adult lifespan, but does not strongly affect other adult traits, such as fertility, while the class  <dig> daf- <dig> mutation is more pleitropic and negatively affects fertility  <cit> . we observed that vit- <dig> and - <dig> mrna levels were similar to wildtype in both daf- <dig> mutants on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but were strongly reduced in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites on adult day  <dig> . reduced vit- <dig> transcript abundance in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites was dependent on daf- <dig>  which encodes a foxo transcription factor that is the major target of signaling by the daf-2/insulin receptor, and vit mrnas were present at normal levels in day  <dig> daf-16; daf- <dig> hermaphrodites   <cit> . we investigated whether sod- <dig>  a direct target of daf- <dig>  also changed progressively between adult days  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . unlike vit- <dig>  sod- <dig> mrna did not undergo a progressive change, but was maintained at high levels in daf- <dig> mutants across this period  . this suggests that vit-2/- <dig> repression in daf- <dig> adults occurs through a different mechanism than sod- <dig> activation. in contrast to the progressive decline we observed for vit transcripts in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, yp levels were depressed in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites for the entire reproductive period  . yp suppression in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites was also daf-16-dependent. although yp levels were consistently lower in daf- <dig> adults, actin was present at normal levels .

sperm stimulate vit mrna levels in hermaphrodites
we next considered whether the progressive decline in vit mrna levels could reflect a physiological change that occurred between adult days  <dig> and  <dig>  this period encompasses the fertile period, when c. elegans hermaphrodites lay a brood of approximately  <dig> eggs. sperm abundance limits fertility in wildtype hermaphrodites, and cessation of egg production reflects sperm depletion  <cit> . to investigate the relationship between reproduction and vit expression, we examined vit transcripts and yp levels in mutants with reproductive defects. in fem- <dig> hermaphrodites, which fail to produce sperm  <cit> , vit- <dig> and vit- <dig> mrna were significantly reduced on adult days  <dig> and  <dig> compared to wildtype . these transcripts remained suppressed at days  <dig> and  <dig>  but were not statistically significantly different than in the wildtype at these ages. in contrast, vit- <dig> and - <dig> mrna levels were normal in fem- <dig> animals, which develop a masculinized germline producing primarily sperm   <cit> . the levels of sod- <dig> mrna were roughly normal in both strains, indicating that the fem- <dig> and fem- <dig> mutations did not have pleitropic effects on daf-2/daf- <dig> pathway activity . thus, vit transcriptional suppression may be correlated with deficits in sperm, but not oocyte, production.

to test this hypothesis, we examined whether wildtype sperm could stimulate vit- <dig> mrna levels in sperm-deficient fem- <dig> hermaphrodites by measuring mrna after allowing them to mate with wildtype males. we confirmed that mating rescued fem- <dig> sterility by the appearance of fertile heterozygous progeny . sterile fem- <dig> hermaphrodites co-cultured with wildtype males exhibited a broad range of vit- <dig> mrna levels which, on average, were elevated compared to unmated fem- <dig> hermaphrodites . on adult day  <dig>  we observed a statistically significant elevation in vit- <dig> mrna levels from mating . mating had no effect on sod- <dig> mrna . the progressive decline in vit- <dig> mrna between adult days  <dig> and  <dig> was also abrogated by coculture with wildtype males . these results demonstrate that vit transcriptional suppression in sterile fem- <dig> hermaphrodites could be rescued by the introduction of wildtype sperm from mating.

to assess the impact of reduced vit transcripts on overall yolk protein production, we examined yp <dig> levels in sterile fem- <dig> adult hermaphrodites. in comparison to wildtype adults, yp levels relative to myosin were normal or elevated in fem- <dig> adults . yolk protein levels were also elevated in germline-masculinized fem- <dig> hermaphrodites. this indicates that the sperm-dependent stimulation in vit-2/ <dig> mrna levels is likely to be dispensable for yp production under normal conditions.

deficits in iis suppress vitellogenesis through two separable effects
our analysis showed that vit-2/- <dig> transcriptional suppression in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites followed the same temporal pattern as in wildtype hermaphrodites. since vit- <dig> mrna was stimulated by sperm in fem- <dig> hermaphrodites, we tested whether wildtype sperm could also enhance vit- <dig> mrna levels in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites. when daf- <dig> hermaphrodites were cocultured with wildtype males, vit- <dig> mrna levels were stabilized during days 1- <dig>  compared to self-fertilized hermaphrodites . similar results were obtained for vit- <dig> mrna . mating had no significant effect on sod- <dig> message levels in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, consistent with regulation of these targets through distinct mechanisms . as noted for fem- <dig>  we detected a broad range of vit transcript levels in mated daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, such that relative differences in vit transcripts of mated compared to selfed daf- <dig> hermaphrodites were not statistically significant at any single timepoint. this variation is likely to reflect differences in mating efficiency between trials  <cit> . we confirmed that mating occurred by the presence of heterozygous male progeny. mating did not significantly alter progeny production nor have adverse effects for the mated hermaphrodites, such as death from internal hatching of embryos . although mating stimulated levels of vit- <dig> transcripts in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, there was no effect on yp . in both mated and unmated daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, yp <dig> levels were equivalently reduced in comparison to wildtype.

cis-acting requirements for vitellogenin repression in daf- <dig> adults
to further characterize the basis for yp suppression in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, we tested whether a gfp reporter expressed from the vit- <dig> promoter could recapitulate daf- <dig> regulation of endogenous yp. using an pvit-2:gfp reporter containing  <dig> kb of upstream promoter sequence :gfp), we compared gfp fluorescence in daf- <dig> day  <dig> adult hermaphrodites grown on daf- <dig> rnai or control conditions. the pvit-2:gfp reporter was a transgene maintained as a stably-transmitted extrachromosomal array. if the pvit-2:gfp reporter were a target for daf- <dig> suppression of vitellogenesis, then we expected daf- <dig> rnai to block daf- <dig> activity and allow increased gfp expression in a daf- <dig> background. consistently, the level of gfp fluorescence was higher in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites treated with daf- <dig> rnai than untreated animals  . as a negative control, we found that daf- <dig> rnai did not affect gfp expression from the intestinal gly- <dig> promoter  <cit> , which is independent of daf-2-pathway regulation .

^ relative gfp fluorescence . data show % change  of average maximum gfp fluorescence from daf- <dig> rnai versus control in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites. positive values indicate increased pvit-2:gfp fluorescence associated with reduced daf- <dig> activity from rnai. bold indicates gfp intensity was significantly different in daf- <dig> rnai-treated animals in all trials .

* gfp fluorescence intensity increased statistically significantly in 3/ <dig> trials . in the remaining  <dig> trials, % gfp intensity change on daf- <dig> rna was +5%  and +6% 

using gfp reporters expressed from subfragments of the 2-kb vit- <dig> promoter, we identified a cis-regulatory region responsive to daf- <dig> activity. deletions of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb upstream of the vit- <dig> translational start sequence did not disrupt daf-16-dependent repression of pvit-2:gfp expression in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites . thus, daf- <dig> regulation of yp requires only a short 300-bp vit- <dig> promoter, but not additional upstream sequences. the 300-bp vit- <dig> promoter contains binding sites for three transcription factors that direct vitellogenenin expression in the adult hermaphrodite intestine: the elt- <dig> gata factor, the male-specific transcriptional repressor mab- <dig>  and an unidentified factor which binds to vpe <dig> repeat sequences in the vit- <dig> promoter  <cit> . daf- <dig> recognizes its transcriptional targets through a binding site with consensus gtaaac/ta  <cit> . although the vit- <dig> promoter contains this sequence within the 5-kb upstream of the translational start  <cit> , we did not detect any matches within the 300-bp promoter fragment sufficient for daf-16-mediated repression.

we also examined gfp mrna levels in animals containing an integrated pvit-2:gfp transgene. as for the endogenous vit- <dig> locus, gfp mrna was not detectable in wildtype or daf- <dig> adults immediately after the l4-adult molt , but increased dramatically by adult day  <dig> . levels of gfp mrna were similar in day  <dig> wildtype and daf- <dig> adults . this observation suggests that, like endogenous vit- <dig>  the pvit-2:gfp transgene was not subject to transcriptional suppression at this time point. this is consistent with the conclusion that daf- <dig> activity in daf- <dig> adults acts to repress gfp levels at a posttranscriptional step.

discussion
this study's goal was to characterize the effect of daf- <dig> pathway activity on vitellogenesis in c. elegans. our findings corroborate previous reports showing that daf- <dig> activity suppresses vitellogenesis at both the transcriptional and translational levels  <cit> . however, our temporal analysis of this suppression do not support a simple model where daf- <dig> acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of vit genes. first, yp levels were reduced in a daf-16-dependent manner in young adults, although vit mrna levels were normal or elevated at this stage. second, wildtype sperm stimulated vit- <dig> mrna non-autonomously in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, but failed to increase yp levels. third, we observed daf-16-dependent suppression of pvit-2:gfp expression, although this promoter fragment lacks dbe-like daf- <dig> binding sites, with the caveat that daf- <dig> might bind to non-dbe sites in the vit- <dig> promoter  <cit> . finally, we note that vit genes were not represented among  <dig> direct daf- <dig> targets identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation  <cit> .

since these data do not seemingly support the simple model that daf- <dig> functions as a transcriptional repressor at the vit loci, we propose an alternative model whereby daf- <dig> represses vitellogenesis through two parallel pathways that independently regulate vit transcription and translation . at the transcriptional level, increased daf- <dig> activity in daf- <dig> adults was associated with a progressive decline of vit mrna which mirrored a similar progressive decline of vit mrna in wildtype adults. we also found that vit mrna levels were low in a feminized mutant unable to produce sperm, but were normal in a masculinized mutant that produces sperm but not oocytes. together, these observations suggest a role for sperm in stimulating vit mrna levels in early adulthood. the daf- <dig> pathway promotes germcell proliferation and daf- <dig> hermaphrodites have low fertility at 25°c  <cit> . because the introduction of wildtype sperm could stimulate vit mrna levels in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, we theorize that daf- <dig> hermaphrodites are deficient in a sperm-derived signal that simulates vit-2/- <dig> gene transcription.

in contrast to the progressive decline of vit mrna in daf- <dig> hermaphrodites, yolk protein production was suppressed constitutively throughout adulthood. this observation suggests a shift of translation regulation. consistently, gfp expression from the pvit-2:gfp transcriptional reporter was suppressed in a daf-16-dependent manner, although gfp mrna levels were comparable in wildtype and daf- <dig> hermaphrodites. when under stress, cells respond by upregulating translation of stress-resistance proteins, such as heat-shock proteins and chaperones. at the same time, cells repress translation of non-essential proteins to conserve energy supplies  <cit> . one interpretation of our results is that daf- <dig> adults undergo a similar translational switch to repress yp synthesis in early adulthood. genetic results indicate that such a shift in translational regulation should be regulated by one or more daf- <dig> target genes. it is not currently known if specific daf- <dig> targets may regulate translation. however, ms analysis of  <dig> proteins in daf- <dig> and wildtype adults identified  <dig> proteins with differential abundance, only  <dig> of which had been previously identified as daf- <dig> target genes  <cit> . while the remaining  <dig> proteins might be novel daf- <dig> targets, as proposed  <cit> , it is also possible that these might represent additional secondary targets of a daf-16-dependent shift in translational regulation. we note that global translational reprogramming in response to thermal stress  occurs normally in daf- <dig> adults  <cit> . thus, daf-2/daf- <dig> pathway activity may regulate translational reprogramming at 25°c, a relatively nonstressful condition, but not under severe stress, such as at 35°c.

we were surprised to observe significant discordance between vit transcript and yp levels under the conditions we examined in the course of this study. in wildtype adults, yp <dig> increased during adulthood although vit- <dig> and - <dig> mrna decreased. furthermore, yp <dig> was reduced in daf- <dig> day  <dig> adults which contained normal levels of vit- <dig> and - <dig> mrna. we acknowledge the caveat that other vit loci , which contribute to the yp <dig> pool, may have increased expression to make up for the decline in vit- <dig> and - <dig>  however, other studies have observed these  <dig> loci to be expressed at similar levels  <cit>  . in addition, alternative regulation of these loci could not account for the discrepancy between vit mrna and yp <dig> in day  <dig> daf- <dig> adults.

discrepancies between mrna and protein levels have been observed under other conditions. studies in yeast have examined the correlation between transcript and protein abundance on a large scale. with the exception of highly expressed genes, these studies report little correlation between relative levels of mrna and protein, concluding that transcript levels may be inadequate reflections of the true cellular composition  <cit> . one factor that could contribute to discordance between vit transcript and yp levels is the potential accumulation of yp within embryos in the hermaphrodite uterus or the pseudocoelomic body cavity. thus, older hermaphrodites containing more eggs in the uterus might also contain more yolk in bulk lysates. however, this explanation does not account for our finding that fem- <dig> hermaphrodites, which fail to make oocytes, contained normal levels of yp <dig>  in this strain, yp are likely to accumulate in the pseudocoelom. rather, we hypothesize that vit genes are transcribed at high levels on the first day of adulthood, in anticipation of reproductive needs. then, as reproduction proceeds over the next 3- <dig> days, vit mrna levels are titrated downward in response to actual reproductive demand. providing excess vit transcripts in early adulthood may ensure adequate yp synthesis capacity for maximum reproductive rate.

CONCLUSIONS
vitellogenins have been repeatedly identified as targets repressed by daf- <dig> activity and downregulated under prolongevity conditions  <cit> . furthermore, vitellogenin downregulation by rnai was itself sufficient to extend adult c. elegans lifespan  <cit> . these findings indicate that longevity and somatic maintenance in daf- <dig> mutants is likely to reflect combinatorial effects of protective enzyme induction and reproductive suppression. our studies show that daf- <dig> pathway deficits suppress vitellogenesis through two separable mechanisms. this reveals new insight that longevity assurance in daf- <dig> mutants can result from convergent regulation of vitellogenesis by pleitropic phenotypes in these mutants.
