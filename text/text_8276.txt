BACKGROUND
chickpea  is the second most important grain legume cultivated mostly on residual soil moisture in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world. it is a self-pollinated crop and cross pollination is a rare event   <cit> . chickpea has its origin in south-eastern turkey, and after its domestication, from a closely related wild species c. reticulatum ladizinsky, in the middle east this crop progressed further throughout the mediterranean region, india and ethiopia  <cit> . it is a rich source of protein to vegetarian diets, especially in india. globally, it is cultivated on over  <dig>  mha with an annual production of  <dig>  million tons  <cit>  and productivity is less than 1 t/ha which is very much less than estimated potential of 6 t/ha under optimum growing conditions. in india, it is cultivated on  <dig>  mha with  <dig>  million tons production and an average productivity of 920 kg/ha. about 71 % of the global area with 67 % of global production of chickpea is contributed by india. despite being the largest producer, india imports chickpea from several countries e.g. australia, turkey, mexico, usa, canada etc.

several biotic and abiotic stress have been affecting the chickpea productivity. however, efforts to increase the productivity could not yield much success due to low genetic diversity in cultivated gene pool  <cit> . this limited genetic diversity in the cultivate gene pool affects genetics and genomic studies in chickpea as number of markers found polymorphic between parents were comparatively very low in comparison to other crops. for instance after screening more than two thousand markers on intra-specific chickpea populations  only couple of hundred representing ~10 % of total polymorphic markers could be identified for these populations  <cit> . in cases with low genetic diversity, identification of polymorphic markers between contrasting parents is time consuming and tedious task  <cit> .

recent advances in next-generation sequencing  technologies dramatically reduced the cost on sequencing and are being deployed to understand the genome architecture, variations in genomes, identify the candidate genes for biotic and abiotic stresses that limit crop productivity below the production potential  <cit> . in order to harness the untapped genetic potential available for crop improvement in a species, several germplasm lines have been re-sequenced using whole genome re-sequencing  approach in different crops. for instance,  <dig> rice genomes  <cit> , maize  <cit> , sorghum  <cit>  etc., have been re-sequenced.

during recent years, small variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms  and indels are being extensively deployed in crop improvement. sometimes these small variations do not capture all the genomic information associated with a particular phenotypic variation. this may be due to other important class of large genomic variations i.e. structural variations . these svs include inversions, translocations, transversions, copy number variations , insertions and deletions, are genomic rearrangements ranging from  <dig> nucleotides to several megabases with respect to the reference genome  <cit> . in case of humans, these large variations are extensively studied and are associated with important complex disease phenotypes. nevertheless, in case of plants, very few studies explored the usefulness of large variations for instance in maize, svs have been studied between maize and its progenitor  <cit> , while functional impact and origin mechanisms of cnvs were reported in case of barley  <cit> .

nevertheless, the availability of draft genome sequence for several crop plants  <cit>  including chickpea  <cit> , opened new vistas for crop improvement strategies. understanding genome wide variation among parental lines of mapping populations will enable trait mapping and identification of stress responsive candidate genes. with an objective to understand the genome-wide variations that can be deployed for chickpea improvement, we re-sequenced a set  <dig> genotypes that are parental lines of  <dig> mapping populations and segregate for different biotic and abiotic stresses as well as nutritionally important traits in chickpea.

RESULTS
to dissect complex biotic and abiotic stresses, several bi-parental mapping populations and next generation mapping populations like multi-parent advanced generation intercross  population are being used at icrisat. although few thousand simple sequence repeat  markers are available for trait mapping in chickpea, limited polymorphism among parental lines of bi-parental mapping population has been hindering the trait mapping efforts to reach to the candidate genes responsible for the traits of interest  <cit> . nevertheless, genome-wide variations like snps, cnvs and pavs are very important for trait mapping and crop improvement and gaining importance in recent years.

in order to gain insights into the genome-wide variations that can be used for trait dissection and in-turn for chickpea improvement,  <dig> chickpea genotypes with diverse origin  and representing both market classes  were re-sequenced in this study. these  <dig> chickpea genotypes are parental lines of  <dig> mapping populations segregating for abiotic , biotic stresses  and nutritionally important  traits; parental lines of magic population and parental lines of marker-assisted recurrent selecion  populations .

in silico mapping of sequence data 
a total of  <dig>  gb comprising of  <dig>  million  <dig> and 100 bp reads were generated for  <dig> genotypes of chickpea at an average sequencing depth of  <dig> x for each line . the trimming and processing of the data resulted in  <dig>  million high quality reads. on aligning the clean data, using bowtie  <dig>  to the cdc frontier reference genome the mapping rate of reads varied from  <dig>  %  to  <dig>  % . the variation in mapping rate among different genotypes may be due to divergence among the parental genotypes used in the study. on an average  <dig>  % reads from each genotype were aligned to the reference genome with  <dig>  % average coverage. the number of reads from each genotype aligned on to reference genome varied from  <dig> , <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  while uniquely aligned reads varied from  <dig> , <dig>  to  <dig> , <dig>  thus on an average  <dig>  % high quality reads were uniquely aligned to the genome. the mean depth ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with an average of ~ <dig>  for all the samples. higher mean depths of  <dig>  and  <dig>  were observed in icc  <dig> and jaki  <dig> because of comparatively higher amount of reads generated for these samples .

snps and their distribution
to determine the extent of sequence diversity among  <dig> chickpea genotypes, clean reads were aligned to the reference genome assembly of chickpea. as a result, a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps were identified across all  <dig> genotypes re-sequenced . prior to this study,  <dig>  snps were identified by  <dig> transcriptome sequencing of cicer arietinum and cicer reticulatum genotypes  <cit> . in addition, few hundreds of snps were also reported using solexa ⁄ illumina sequencing, amplicon sequencing of tentative orthologous genes , mining of expressed sequence tags  and sequencing of candidate genes . wgrs approach has also been deployed in several crops for instance soybean  <cit> , rice  <cit> , pepper  <cit> , maize  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> . among the snps on eight pseudomolecules , most snps were identified on ca <dig>  and the least on ca <dig> , accounting for  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the snps, respectively . a total of  <dig>  snps were identified on unanchored scaffolds and contigs  accounting to  <dig>  % of snps identified. the snp density varied among pseudomolecules; ca <dig> has the highest density  and ca <dig> had the lowest density  . amongst the pseudomolecules, ca <dig> was found to have maximum polymorphism rate , while ca <dig> had least polymorphism rate . this study further re-affirms the results reported earlier  <cit>  which may be due to presence of large repetitive regions in ca <dig> pseudomolecule. the minimum density for exonic variants was observed on ca <dig>  while the maximum was found on ca <dig>  among the pseudomolecules . least density for exonic variants was  <dig>  exon variants/kb on ca <dig>  this means there were maximum changes in the coding regions of ca <dig>  in concurrence with the result of varshney et al  <cit> . the number of snps per genotype varied from  <dig>   to  <dig> , <dig>  . icc  <dig> among desi and icc  <dig> among kabuli genotypes were found to have maximum number of snps. the number of pair-wise snps were high between ig  <dig> and ig  <dig>  and least between cdc-frontier and iccv  <dig>  . the number of snps reported in the study are higher compared to the previous studies . this may be due to diverse parental lines and wild genotypes used in the present study. the snps were categorized further into homozygous and heterozygous snps based on called snps in each genotype against the reference genome . maximum number of homozygous snps were identified in case of pi  <dig>  and minimum in case of iccv  <dig> . among  <dig> genotypes maximum heterozygosity rate was observed in case of ig  <dig> , while least heterozygosity rate was observed in case of pi  <dig> . the mean heterozygosity rate was  <dig>  across the  <dig> genotypes .fig.  <dig> genome-wide variations in  <dig> chickpea genotypes. a distribution of snps, insertions, deletions and polymorphisms on eight pseudomolecules of chickpea. b insertions and deletions identified in each chickpea genotype used in the present study



insertions and deletions 
insertions and deletions ranging from 1 bp to 58 bp were considered as indels in the present study. in total,  <dig>  indels were identified across  <dig> chickpea genotypes . the maximum number of deletions,  <dig>  were 1 bp in length, while the least number of deletions  were of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 57 bp in lengths. the maximum number of insertions were  <dig>  with 1 bp length, while the minimum number was  <dig> with 58 bp length . of these indels,  <dig>  were the deletions and  <dig>  were insertions. the density of deletions and insertions were  <dig>  and  <dig>  per kb respectively across the genome . further, indel analysis for each sample against the reference, cdc-frontier, revealed the maximum indels in ig  <dig> , and minimum indels in iccv  <dig>  respectively . when insertions to deletions ratio was calculated for each genotype, the maximum and minimum indel ratios were  <dig>  and  <dig>  in case of jaki  <dig> and ilc  <dig> respectively. in jg  <dig>  jg  <dig>  wr  <dig> and iccv  <dig> the indel ratio was ~ <dig> .

copy number variations  and presence absence variations 
cnvs and pavs were determined in case of genes longer than  <dig> kb. the gene ontology analysis was done using swiss-prot and trembl databases . a non-redundant set of  <dig>  genes were found duplicated across different genotypes and for  <dig>  genes uniprot ids were retrieved and assigned. out of these,  <dig>  genes were found duplicated across just one of the samples making them line specific duplicated genes. gene ca_ <dig> was found duplicated across a maximum of  <dig> samples . ca_ <dig> with go ids go:0016021; go: <dig> was found to be receptor-like protein  <dig>  present to function for cell membrane. duplicated genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amongst different genotypes. in jg  <dig>  a maximum of  <dig>  genes were found duplicated while the minimum number of genes  were duplicated in jg  <dig> . maximum number of defence related genes  were duplicated in a salt tolerant line icc  <dig> 

similarly, a non-redundant set of  <dig> genes were not found in any genotype. uniprot ids could be assigned for  <dig> genes. amongst these,  <dig> genes were not present in any of the genotypes suggesting line specific gene deletion . the gene ca_ <dig> was absent in eight genotypes, however, it is an uncharacterized protein. ca_ <dig> was not present in  <dig> genotypes and its putative function was pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein belonging to ppr family, pcmp-e subfamily. the pavs result depicted that there were no genes deleted in iccv  <dig>  ig  <dig> and pi  <dig> . a maximum of  <dig> genes were found deleted in jg  <dig> followed by  <dig> genes in iccv  <dig> 

 miscellaneous variations
in addition to above variations, an effort was made to identify miscellaneous variations like inter-chromosomal variations , intra-chromosomal variations  and inversions . of  <dig> miscellaneous variations,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were ctx, itx and inv respectively. to further avoid false positives, we have used stringent cutoff of  <dig>  as a result  <dig> miscellaneous variations were identified on eight pseudomolecules . ctx were in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp spread over ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig>  and ca <dig> . itx were in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig>  mbp spread over ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig> , ca <dig>  and ca <dig> . while inv were in the range of  <dig> bp to  <dig>  mbp predominantly on ca <dig> , followed by ca <dig> , ca <dig>  and ca <dig> .table  <dig> distribution of miscellaneous variations on eight pseudomolecules of chickpea

line specific variations
a total of  <dig>  unique line specific variations including  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels were observed among  <dig> chickpea genotypes studied. maximum number of line specific variations,  <dig> , were observed in pi  <dig> , and followed by  <dig>  in ig  <dig>  . we further compared line specific variations among parental genotypes that segregate for abiotic stresses  and biotic stresses . although larger number of line specific snps and indels were identified in the case of helicoverpa resistant wild species genotype ig  <dig>  interestingly no species specific deletion and duplication of genes were identified . on contrary, in the case of parental genotypes of mapping population segregating for helicoverpa resistance  the number of line specific snps and indels differed significantly. similarly, large number of line specific variations among parental lines of mapping populations segregating for ascochyta blight , fusarium wilt , botrytis grey mould and salinity , were identified that can be used for developing high density genetic maps, trait mapping as well as for marker-assisted selection. among  <dig> chickpea genotypes, the line specific variations were <  <dig> in case of icc  <dig>  iccv  <dig>  pb  <dig>  jg  <dig>  icc  <dig>  jaki  <dig> and c  <dig>  among  <dig> genotypes, interestingly no line specific variation was observed in the case of c  <dig>  further, the number of line specific variations were in the range of ~ <dig> to ~ <dig>  in case of remaining  <dig> genotypes . the maximum percentage of line specific variations found in coding regions in icc  <dig>  followed by iccv  <dig>  . the mean of the line specific variations in the coding region was found  <dig>  %, while none of the line specific variations in coding regions were observed in the case of icc  <dig> and jaki  <dig>  when the frame shift, start lost, stop gained and stop lost mutations were summed up and their percentage were calculated out of the total variations in coding regions, the maximum of  <dig>  % was observed in pb  <dig> genotype, while there were none in  <dig> genotypes  . among the parental lines of magic population, line specific snps, line specific deletions and line specific insertions were high in case of jg  <dig>  further, gene deletions ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , while gene duplications ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   . overall large variation is evident at genome level in case of parental lines of magic population. the main purpose of developing magic populations is to create and harness the genetic diversity for crop improvement. in summary, the magic lines developed from these lines will possess tremendous variation that can be used for allele mining and gene discovery. the line specific variants were further annotated using uniprot repository. the annotation revealed the effect of these line specific variants on a number of transcription factors and their regulators like zinc finger protein, bhlh, wrky, f-box, bzip, phd, scream and mads box, etc. along with tfs, disease resistace nb-lrr protein, heat shock proteins, dna- damage repair proteins, nodulation signaling pathway related proteins were also affected .fig.  <dig> genome-wide variations identified in chickpea genotypes resistant or susceptible to important biotic stresses. circos diagrams represent line specific snps, indels, gene deletions and duplications. each circos represents eight chickpea pseudomolecules and consists of four concentric rings where a represents snps, b represents indels, c represents deletion and d represents duplication events. the deletion events are marked with triangles in green ring and circles represent duplications in red. a distribution of variations among helicoverpa resistant and susceptible genotypes. the green, red, blue, and yellow color inside all rings represents vijay, ig  <dig>  icc  <dig> and icc  <dig> respectively. b distribution of variations among fusarium wilt resistant and susceptible genotypes. the green, red, blue, and yellow color inside all rings represents c  <dig>  jg  <dig>  wr  <dig> and iccv  <dig> respectively. c distribution of variations among ascochyta blight resistant and susceptible genotypes. the green, red, blue, and yellow color inside all rings represents iccv  <dig>  jg  <dig>  pb  <dig> and iccv  <dig> respectively



annotation of genome-wide variations
in general, premature stop, frame-shift and presence/absence variations lead to genetic load by disabling the gene functions which may lead to inbreeding depression. hence, we annotated the genome-wide variations. among  <dig> , <dig> variations,  <dig>  were mis-sense,  <dig> were non-sense and  <dig>  were the silent mutations . however, large variations  were in intergenic region. of  <dig>  variations detected in the genic regions,  <dig>  were intronic variations and  <dig>  were exonic variations . out of these exonic variations,  <dig>  were non-synonymous substitutions. on comparing the distribution of snps across genomic regions, snps were most abundant in intergenic regions  and the proportion of snps were high in the introns  than exons . genetic variant annotation and effect prediction tool was used to predict the effect of all snps, homozygous snps and heterozygous snps identified among all  <dig> chickpea genotypes . the number of snps leading to stop-gain or non-sense mutations among different genotypes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the indels were studied for their affects on the genome for each of the genotypes. maximum insertions affecting the genic regions was seen in ig  <dig>  while the least in iccv  <dig>  . similarly, maximum deletions occurring in the genic regions were observed in ig  <dig>  and the minimum of  <dig>  % in jaki  <dig> .

we identified  <dig> variations in the “qtl-hotspot” region on ca <dig>  reported earlier to enhance the drought tolerance in chickpea  <cit>  . among these variations, notably two codon insertions were found in ca_ <dig>  belonging to 7s seed storage gene family and reported to enhance seed size  <cit> . in addition we also identified  <dig> variations that were non-synonymous coding affecting a total of  <dig> genes with functions like heat stress transcription factor a-6b, epf-like protein  <dig> and early light-induced protein  .

CONCLUSIONS
the genome-wide variations identified in the present study can be used for developing high density snp arrays for genetics and breeding applications. further, large number of line specific variations among the wild accessions indicate that the wild chickpea has much more diverse genepool than the cultivated chickpea, thus may contain useful genetic resources for chickpea improvement.
