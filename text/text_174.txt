BACKGROUND
cells must be able to flexibly adjust the structural and functional capacity of their compartments in order to adapt to stress or changing nutrients, to assume specialized tissue functions and to maintain homeostasis.

the biogenesis of cellular organelles involves the assembly and targeting of numerous proteins and membrane lipids, and often these processes are orchestrated by transcription factors whose activities are adjusted in response to stress or developmental cues. while much is known regarding the regulation of lipids, mitochondria, peroxisomes and the er  <cit> , understanding the transcriptional regulation of lysosomal function remains less advanced.

lysosomes are defined by acidic luminal ph, characteristic membrane proteins and lipids, and the presence of multiple acidic hydrolases that catalyze the degradation of material reaching the compartment through fluid-phase endocytosis, phagocytosis or autophagy  <cit> . abnormalities of lysosomal function, content, number, morphology or gene expression are characteristic of multiple inherited lysosomal storage diseases, of cellular senescence, organismal ageing, atherosclerosis, alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . ectopic secretion of lysosomal proteases can lead to excessive extracellular matrix degradation, which in turn contributes to metastasis, emphysema, atherosclerosis, arthritis, osteoporosis and the formation of aneurysms  <cit> .

large-scale gene expression correlation analyses have shown that a number of lysosomal genes form coordinated clusters, or synexpression groups, suggesting that expression of these targets is co-regulated under varying conditions  <cit> . sardiello et al. performed a pattern search of lysosomal promoters, leading to the identification of a specific e-box, which was found to be recognized by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor called tfeb  <cit> . ectopically expressed tfeb causes an upregulation of multiple lysosomal genes, leading to increased numbers of lysosomes, enhanced degradation of endocytic substrates, and lysosomal exocytosis  <cit> .

transcriptional regulation of lysosomal function has been studied mainly during autophagy, and in this context several transcription factors have been shown to play roles in lysosomal gene regulation, including gata- <dig>  <cit> , foxo <dig>  <cit>  and tfeb  <cit> .

lysosomal substrates of extracellular origin impose a particular load on macrophages and other phagocytic myeloid cells that process microbes, senescent cells and effete tissue material  <cit> . how the degradative capacity of lysosomes in such cells is regulated during stress and differentiation remains poorly understood.

here, we used expression correlation analyses to search for novel regulators of lysosome-specific genes. we found that transcription factors whose expression correlates with lysosomal genes are often involved in differentiation, embryonic development and interferon signaling. the strongest candidate that emerged from our computations was signal transducer and activator of transcription- <dig> , a transcription factor regulated by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  the roles of il- <dig> and stat <dig> in modulating lysosomal gene expression were evaluated in a primary cell culture model of alternatively activated mouse macrophages using data based on gene expression profiling, quantitative pcr and chromatin immunoprecipitations. results obtained with macrophages from wild-type and stat6-deficient mice demonstrate that stat <dig> positively regulates a large number of lysosomal genes in an il-4-dependent manner.

RESULTS
identification of transcriptional networks through correlation analysis
previous studies have shown that the mrna levels of transcriptional regulators are often predictive of the expression of their target genes  <cit> . based on this premise, we asked whether mrna correlation analyses across multiple datasets might reveal novel regulators of lysosomal gene expression.

calculations were performed using expression profiles based on specific mouse and human affymetrix microarray platforms for which large numbers of independent datasets are available at the ncbi geo repository  <cit> . we then processed these files to generate average expression values for named, full-length mrnas. a list of known transcription factors was assembled from gene ontology  annotations and the literature  <cit> .

to verify the usefulness of the processed expression data for extracting transcriptional regulators, we initially interrogated the datasets for two pathways whose regulation is already well understood. we began by calculating a matrix of pearson correlations between  <dig> mouse genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and  <dig>  known transcription factors. the results were aggregated according to transcription factor and ranked. the resulting list was led by srebf <dig>  which encodes the transcription factor srebp- <dig>  known in fact to be a pivotal regulator of cholesterol metabolism and of the genes in the reference set   <cit> .

to further trial this strategy on a pathway for organelle biogenesis, we selected a group of  <dig> highly coordinated er genes and found that this cluster correlates most strongly with xbp <dig>  an established master regulator of the er stress response and of er biogenesis   <cit> .

in a complementary approach, srebf <dig> and xbp <dig> were each used as reference to calculate expression correlations with  <dig>  mouse genes. of the  <dig> genes that correlated most strongly with srebf <dig>  five are involved in cholesterol metabolism , and of the  <dig> genes most strongly correlated with xbp <dig> nine encode proteins associated with the er  . these values are similar to results returned by the netview tool, which returns lists of ‘nearest neighbors’ based on co-occurrence in expression quantile groups  <cit> ; according to netview, the sets of  <dig> nearest neighbors for srebf <dig> and xbp <dig> each include five genes associated with cholesterol metabolism or the er, respectively . taken together, the above results confirm that correlation analyses of co-regulated gene groups across our processed datasets can identify transcription factors that coordinate their expression.

correlation analysis of lysosomal gene expression
we next asked which transcription factors might correlate with the expression of lysosomal genes. calculations were performed for  <dig> mouse and  <dig> human dna-binding transcription factors for which high-quality data are available in the processed microarray datasets. in each case the  <dig> highest-ranking correlators were then analyzed for go set enrichment using the bioconductor gostats package  <cit> . the resulting tables were searched for the terms ‘lysosome’ or ‘vacuole’, returning  <dig> transcription factors that scored positive at a significance cutoff of p ≤  <dig>  and according to both mouse and human datasets . the  <dig> transcriptional regulators include two factors, mitf and tfeb, that have previously been shown to direct the expression of lysosomal genes during differentiation and autophagy, respectively  <cit> . further validating the data is the presence of  <dig> regulators that are known to physically associate with the endomembrane system . a majority , however, have been implicated during embryonic development or differentiation . also prominent are transcription factors involved in interferon signaling .

the above results suggest that lysosomal gene sets are re-programmed in the context of different transcriptional networks. we therefore sought to identify subsets of lysosomal genes that are likely to be coordinately regulated. correlations were calculated among a list of  <dig> lysosomal genes that had been assembled from go annotations and reviews of the lysosomal proteome  <cit> . computations were performed across  <dig>  mouse datasets, and the genes were clustered hierarchically according to average correlation coefficients. inspection of the resulting dendrogram and heat map identify three principal clusters, suggesting that the genes in each of these groups are often controlled collectively .

cluster  <dig> consists of  <dig> genes encoding lysosomal proteins whose functional profiles are generally similar to that of the entire lysosomal gene set. however, an unexpectedly large number of cluster  <dig> genes  have also been found at the plasma membrane  or extracellularly ; of lysosomal genes outside of cluster  <dig>  only 33% fall into either of these categories.

cluster  <dig> consists of  <dig> genes that cover a range of different lysosomal functions, but subunits of the vacuolar h+ atpase  and components of the endo/lysosomal trafficking machinery  are particularly prominent. the expression of genes in cluster  <dig> is correlated negatively with 78% of cluster  <dig>  suggesting that these gene sets are frequently regulated reciprocally.

cluster  <dig>  the largest coherent group, includes  <dig> lysosomal genes whose protein products are involved in all aspects of lysosome physiology, including hydrolysis, acidification, transport and antigen presentation.

collectively, the preceding analyses support the conclusion that distinct subsets of lysosomal genes can be coordinately regulated, hinting at the existence of dedicated transcriptional networks that control the expression of these clusters. the relatively low average correlation values indicate that such networks would be active only in a subset of physiological contexts.

transcription factors co-regulated with lysosomal syn-expression groups
next, in order to explore the contexts and possible regulation of the three lysosomal gene clusters, each group was used as reference set for correlation analyses with known transcription factors across both mouse and human datasets. the complete results of these calculations are given in additional file  <dig>  and the ten highest-ranking transcription factors are listed in figure  <dig> 

a large proportion of the transcription factors that correlate with cluster  <dig> are known to play roles in embryonic development and morphogenesis . based on pubmed literature searches, none have been associated with the regulation of lysosomal or vacuolar function. two genes, pax <dig> and smyd <dig>  are common to both the mouse and human top- <dig> lists. pax <dig> is important for thyroid and kidney development  <cit> . twenty-nine percent of cluster  <dig> genes  are highly expressed in mouse kidney   <cit> , which may help explain the moderate correlation of pax <dig> with the cluster  <dig> gene set. smyd <dig> encodes a skeletal muscle and heart-specific histone methyltransferase, also known as bop, that acts as a transcriptional repressor  <cit> . whether smyd <dig> contributes to the repression of the lysosomal cluster  <dig> genes is currently not known.

five of the top- <dig> transcription factors that correlate with cluster  <dig>  have been linked to both oxidative stress and autophagy. the intersection of the mouse and human regulators contains three genes , with nfe2l <dig> ranking highest. the nfe2l <dig> gene encodes the protein nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor  <dig> , a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor that activates genes with antioxidant response elements  under conditions of oxidative stress  <cit> . based on published chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing  data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts , nrf <dig> binds to the promoters of five of the cluster  <dig> genes   and to eight additional lysosomal genes  <cit> . in lymphoid cells nrf <dig> binds to the promoter of one of the cluster  <dig> genes  plus nine other lysosomal genes  <cit> , with fnbp <dig> and gabarapl <dig> being recognized in both mefs and lymphoid cells. according to published microarray studies comparing wild-type and nrf2-deficient mouse tissues, the expression of only a small and varying number of cluster  <dig> genes are affected by nrf <dig> in liver, small intestine and prostate  <cit> . consistent across independent studies is the nrf2-dependent regulation of ctsb  in liver, small intestine and prostate  <cit> ; moreover, nrf <dig> binds close to the scpep <dig>  gene in mefs and regulates its expression in liver and small intestine  <cit> . in summary, nrf <dig> regulates a small number of lysosomal genes in a tissue-specific manner, but available evidence does not yet support the concept that nrf <dig> accounts for the coordinate regulation of a majority cluster  <dig> genes.

the transcription factor whose expression profiles correlated most strongly with those of the lysosomal cluster  <dig> was mouse stat <dig>  and following an analogous analysis of human datasets, stat <dig> ranked near the top as well . also correlating strongly with cluster  <dig> are other regulators of immune function  and transcription factors bound to the membrane of the er .

given its strong correlation with the largest lysosomal cluster, stat <dig> was chosen for further in-depth analyses.

stat6
as a cutoff-free approach to identifying which go categories best correlate with stat <dig> we used the gene set enrichment analysis  tool developed by subramanian et al.  <cit> . gsea calculates enrichment scores that reflect to what degree members of a particular go category are concentrated at the extreme of a ranked gene list. the method also defines a ‘leading-edge’ subset of genes that account for the core of the enrichment score. the greatest enrichment scores for genes that correlate with mouse stat <dig> were seen for the go terms ‘lysosomal membrane’ and ‘lysosome’ . in the human datasets the highest-scoring categories are related to type i interferon and toll-like receptor signaling; however, the go sets ‘lysosomal membrane’ and ‘lysosome’ also ranked high . the ‘leading-edge’ subsets for the go term ‘lysosome’ contained  <dig> mouse and  <dig> human lysosomal genes, respectively , of which  <dig> were common to both sets . these results confirm that stat <dig> mrna levels are often coordinated with those of multiple lysosomal genes.

il- <dig> and stat <dig> regulate lysosomal gene expression in macrophages
stat <dig> is a member of the ‘signal transducer and activator of transcription’ family and expressed in most tissues  <cit> . the principal activators of stat <dig> are il- <dig> and il- <dig>  whose binding to cognate receptor complexes leads to recruitment of jaks and jak-mediated stat <dig> phosphorylation, whereupon stat <dig> dimerizes, moves to the nucleus and binds to specific promoter elements  <cit> . in addition to being stimulated by il- <dig> and il- <dig>  stat <dig> can become active in response to other cytokines and certain pathogens  <cit> . to obtain a detailed view of lysosomal gene regulation by il- <dig> and stat <dig>  we analyzed il-4-induced changes of gene expression in macrophages from wild-type and stat6-deficient mice  <cit> . detailed results are given in additional file  <dig> and are graphically summarized in figure  <dig>  in the absence of il- <dig> the stat <dig> genotype had no effect on lysosomal gene expression, as would have been expected. however, in cells exposed to il- <dig> an absence of stat <dig> was associated with significant  changes in the expression of  <dig>  known lysosomal genes. comparing gene expression in stat6-deficient versus wild-type cells,  <dig> lysosomal genes were increased and  <dig> lysosomal genes were decreased .

the  <dig> lysosomal genes that are positively regulated by stat <dig> encode proteins involved in all aspects of lysosomal function, including 39% of known lysosomal hydrolases, most subunits of the vacuolar h+ atpase, components of the vesicular transport machinery and others . of these  <dig> genes, 53% are among the leading edge of mouse lysosomal genes whose expression correlates most significantly with stat <dig> .

in wild-type macrophages exposed to il- <dig>  fifty-one lysosomal genes were induced and  <dig> lysosomal genes were suppressed , reflecting a complex reconfiguration of gene expression in this cell type  <cit> . the contribution of stat <dig> to lysosomal gene expression, however, is generally positive: in stat6-deficient cells the activating effects of il- <dig> were almost completely abolished , whereas the suppressing effects of il- <dig> largely persisted . surprisingly,  <dig> lysosomal genes were suppressed by il- <dig> in stat6-deficient, but not in wild-type cells , indicating that stat <dig> usually antagonizes the inhibitory effect of il- <dig> on the expression of these genes.

next we sought to verify the microarray data through an alternative method. for this, we cultured bone marrow macrophages from wild-type and stat6-deficient mice with il- <dig> for 6 hours, 24 hours or 10 days, and rna was extracted for reverse transcription and quantitative pcr. most targets were chosen from among the lysosomal genes that, according to figure 5d, were decreased at least two-fold in stat6-/- versus stat6+/+ macrophages grown in the presence of il- <dig>  expression of the ppia gene  remained relatively unchanged under the four conditions and was used to normalize values for the remaining genes. the arg <dig> gene , an established target of il-4/stat <dig> signaling  <cit> , was strongly induced by il- <dig> in wild-type cells, but its expression remained low in stat6-deficient cells . similar results were obtained for most of the lysosomal genes that were analyzed, with the strongest regulation by il- <dig> seen for mmp <dig>  acp <dig>  ctsk, atp6v0d <dig>  ifi <dig> and ctsl. only myo7a and hgsnat, which appeared moderately induced by il- <dig> based on microarray analyses , changed much less significantly according to the qpcr data . overall, however, the qpcr results are in good agreement with the microarray data and confirm that il- <dig> controls the expression of multiple lysosomal genes in a stat6-dependent manner.

stat <dig> binds close to lysosomal gene loci
to explore whether stat <dig> might bind to genomic loci encoding lysosomal genes, we interrogated publicly available chip-seq data from il- <dig> treated macrophages  <cit> . according to peak coordinates from macrophages grown with il- <dig> for 4 hours, stat <dig> binds in the vicinity of  <dig>  named genes ,  <dig> of which have been annotated as encoding lysosomal proteins .

as an unbiased approach to determining whether genes associated with specific functions are statistically overrepresented among the  <dig>  stat6-bound targets, the list was subjected to gene set enrichment analysis using gostats  <cit> . excluding categories with more than  <dig> members, the three highest-ranking categories returned by this analysis were ‘ribosomal subunit’ , ‘cytosolic part’  and ‘lysosome’  . these data indicate that genes encoding lysosomal proteins make up a significant fraction of the genomic loci that stat <dig> physically interacts with.

of the  <dig> lysosomal genes whose loci are bound by stat <dig> according to the current measure, 46% are among the genes whose mrna levels were significantly reduced in stat6-deficient macrophages grown with il- <dig> . however, this fraction increases to 72% if stat <dig> peaks located anywhere inside a gene are also counted as targets.

in order to study the kinetics of stat <dig> binding to lysosomal loci, stat <dig> chip-seq peaks from different time points after il- <dig> addition were aligned to genomic maps of the genes whose mrna levels were analyzed in figure  <dig>  as expected, no il- <dig> induced stat <dig> binding could be seen around the ppia locus, whereas several stat <dig> peaks appeared at the arg <dig> gene as early as 15 min after il- <dig> addition . similarly, il- <dig> rapidly induced the binding of stat <dig> to all of the  <dig> lysosomal genes that are shown, and binding patterns remained relatively stable for the subsequent 4 hours. at the atp6v1h, ctsl and ifi <dig> loci additional stat <dig> peaks appear at later time points, suggesting contributions of co-factors whose activities might increase with delayed kinetics. to independently verify the stat <dig> chip-seq data, several peaks were selected for verification by chip-qpcr, and in each case the results were confirmatory . collectively, mrna quantifications and chip-seq data show that stat6-mediated activation of lysosomal gene expression coincides with the binding of stat <dig> to the affected promoters, strongly suggesting that stat <dig> plays a direct role in augmenting the transcription of these targets.

stat <dig> sites at lysosomal genes are near active chromatin
actively transcribed genes are often controlled through promoter and enhancer elements characterized by binding sites for multiple, tissue-specific transcription factors and by the presence of nucleosomes with activating epigenetic modifications such as monomethylated histone h <dig> lysine- <dig>  and acetylated h <dig> lysine- <dig>   <cit> . in macrophages, cell type-specific gene expression depends in part on pu. <dig>  an ets-domain transcription factor required for the development of myeloid and b-lymphoid cell types  <cit> . pu. <dig> has previously been shown to cooperate with stat <dig> in controlling the expression of several genes  <cit> . to characterize stat6-bound genomic regions near lysosomal genes, we studied publicly available chip-seq data to explore the co-localization of stat <dig> with h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and pu. <dig> in samples from wild-type and stat6-deficient macrophages that had been grown ± il- <dig> for 4 hours  <cit> . as a point of reference we selected  <dig> stat <dig> peaks that were observed consistently after  <dig>   <dig> and 4 hours of il- <dig> exposure and within 5 kb of the transcription start sites of lysosomal genes  . of these  <dig> peaks, 75% were marked by the presence of h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and pu. <dig> in wild-type cells grown without il- <dig>  showing that stat <dig> predominantly binds to regions characterized by activating epigenetic markers .

in macrophages, latent enhancers have been defined as sites devoid of h3k4me <dig>  h3k27ac and pu. <dig> that acquire h3k4me <dig> upon stimulation  <cit> , and none of the stat <dig> peaks near lysosomal genes fall into this category .

enhancer elements containing h3k4me <dig>  but no h3k27ac, have been described as “poised” for activation  <cit> . among the regions bound by stat <dig> near lysosomal genes, 86%  have pre-existing nucleosomes containing h3k4me <dig>  but only 4%  contain h3k4me <dig> alone and acquire h3k27ac upon il- <dig> exposure; at  <dig> of these sites  the il- <dig> induced acetylation of h3k <dig> was dependent on stat <dig> .

h3k27ac marks are usually concentrated near promoters and their presence is predictive of gene expression  <cit> . inspection of the data in additional file  <dig> shows that 89%  of the lysosomal stat <dig> peak regions already contain h3k27ac in untreated wild-type cells. we identified  <dig> lysosomal stat <dig> peak regions at which h3k27ac was induced by il- <dig>  and this modification was stat6-dependent near the same  <dig> genes at which il-4/stat <dig> promote monomethylation of h3k <dig> , indicating that stat <dig> coordinates activating chromatin modifications at these promoters. two of the affected targets, atp6v0d <dig> and plekhf <dig>  are among the lysosomal genes whose mrna levels are most strongly regulated by il- <dig> and stat <dig> . at many of the lysosomal genes whose expression is controlled by stat <dig>  il- <dig> exposure led to a pronounced expansion of pre-existing h3k27ac marks around the stat <dig> peaks , and at most of these sites the spreading of h3k27ac was dependent on stat <dig> . in summary, stat <dig> binds near lysosomal genes at sites marked by active chromatin configurations, and at several lysosomal genes stat <dig> contributes to the establishment or expansion of these markers. these results further strengthen the concept that stat <dig> plays pivotal roles in activating the expression of lysosomal genes in macrophages.

discussion
in the current study we used gene expression correlation analyses to search for dna-binding transcription factors whose activities might relate to lysosomal function. the strongest candidate that emerged from our data was stat <dig>  a widely expressed transcription factor that is activated in response to specific cytokines and pathogens. in support of a role for stat <dig> upstream of lysosomal gene expression we demonstrate that il- <dig> induced stat <dig> positively regulates a wide range of lysosomal genes in mouse macrophages.

our in silico strategy was based on a large body of work showing that the expression of transcription factors and their target genes are often positively related  <cit> . if the expression of a group of lysosomal genes was transcriptionally coordinated through the action of a transcription factor, we reasoned, it might be possible to identify such a regulator through correlation analyses across a great number of microarray data. association of transcriptional regulators with their target genes, based on expression data, has previously been demonstrated using a number of methods, including mutual information scoring  <cit> , probabilistic methods  <cit> , differential equations  <cit> , gibbs sampling  <cit>  and spearman correlations  <cit> . here, we applied a simplified clustering approach by calculating pearson correlations between lists of known transcription factors and potential target genes. correlation values were averaged across hundreds of expression datasets, and genes were ranked accordingly. in one round of calculations genes most highly correlated with individual known transcription factors were screened for go set enrichment which, at a cutoff of p ≤  <dig> , produced a list of  <dig> dna-binding regulators whose expression is highly correlated with lysosomal genes. in a complementary approach transcription factors were sorted according to their correlation with groups of co-regulated lysosomal genes.

the list of  <dig> regulators includes mitf and tfeb, two proteins that have been previously identified as regulators of lysosomal gene expression in the context of autophagy, and differentiation  <cit> . further validating our approach was the presence of proteins that are known to be physically associated with compartments of the endomembrane system, including atf <dig>  hcls <dig>  lass <dig>  creb <dig>  nfe2l <dig>  nfe2l <dig>  and tsg <dig>  strikingly, 65% of the  <dig> regulators have been implicated during embryonic development or differentiation, and 22% are involved in interferon signaling, suggesting that these processes are frequently accompanied by reconfiguration of the lysosomal system. augmented expression of lysosomal genes during development and differentiation might support the generation of tissue-specific, lysosome-related organelles  <cit> . moreover, endo/lysosomal factors are increasingly being implicated during cell migration and polarity, both important aspects of development, as well as of wound healing and cancer  <cit> . positive correlation between lysosomal and interferon signaling genes points to the front-line role of lysosomes in the defense against pathogens  <cit> .

cluster analysis of all known lysosomal genes led to the identification of several subgroups whose expression appears to be coordinated. unexpectedly, one cluster was characterized by being correlated negatively with a large fraction of other lysosomal genes, indicating that the expression of these groups is often mutually exclusive. the mechanistic origin and physiological relevance of these results is not yet understood. the largest lysosomal cluster includes large fractions of known acidic hydrolases and vacuolar h+ atpase subunits, supporting the impression from previous studies that core lysosomal functions are transcriptionally coordinated  <cit> . the transcription factor most strongly correlated with this cluster was stat <dig>  a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription family  <cit> , stat <dig> is activated predominantly through jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in response to il- <dig> or il- <dig>  stat6-deficient mice are viable, but suffer defects in the differentiation of several immune and non-immune cell types, exhibit increased susceptibility to infection by certain viral, bacterial and helminthic pathogens and show attenuated allergic responses  <cit> . conversely, ectopically activated stat <dig> is frequently found in tumor samples  <cit> .

in monocytes, stat <dig> signaling promotes the differentiation into a class of alternatively activated macrophages  <cit> . based on microarray data obtained from primary mouse macrophages cultured with il- <dig>  we found that the expression of  <dig> lysosomal genes was dependent on stat <dig>  reflecting 40% of the known lysosomal proteome and 54% of lysosomal genes expressed in this cell type;  <dig> of these genes have been associated with human diseases  <cit> . of particular interest is the role of stat <dig> in controlling the vacuolar h+ atpase that, by virtue of maintaining the acidic ph in the endo/lysosomal system, is pivotal to all aspects of lysosomal function  <cit> . of  <dig> different subunits and associated factors that make up the vacuolar h+ atpase  <cit> ,  <dig> were found to be controlled by stat <dig>  and three subunits  were among the lysosomal genes most strongly induced by il- <dig> 

previous studies have shown that il- <dig> increases the expression of the lysosomal proteases cathepsin l and s in mouse macrophages and of cathepsin s in human bronchial and conjunctival epithelial cells  <cit> ; however, the transcription factor responsible for this regulation had not yet been identified. through analysis of microarray data we found that in mouse macrophages exposure to il- <dig> augments the expression of eight lysosomal protease genes, and in  <dig> of these cases  the il- <dig> effect was dependent on stat <dig>  in total, the il-4/stat <dig> system was found to control the expression of 39% of known lysosomal hydrolases, a group that in addition to proteases, include glycosidases, lipases and other degradative enzymes. genes involved in vesicular targeting to lysosomes and in the movement of substances across the lysosomal membrane are also regulated by il-4/stat <dig>  these effects are likely to contribute to the heightened influx of endocytic substrates and the increased capacity for lysosomal degradation that have previously been observed in il- <dig> treated macrophages  <cit> .

alternatively activated macrophages have been implicated in tissue repair  <cit> , and we speculate that il-4/stat6-mediated expression of lysosomal enzymes may facilitate the repair-associated turnover of extracellular matrix, for example through secretion of acidic hydrolases into the extracellular space  <cit> , or through intracellular digestion of phagocytosed collagen fibrils  <cit> . in support of this model, the lysosomal genes that are most strongly affected by il- <dig> and stat <dig> in macrophages, encoding cathepsins l and k, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, collagenase- <dig> and vacuolar h+ atpase, have all been shown to play important roles in extracellular matrix degradation  <cit> . furthermore, stat6-controlled expression of several lysosomal and extracellular proteases has been implicated in tissue destruction during pulmonary emphysema and is thought to contribute to the invasiveness of glioma tumours  <cit> .

in wild-type macrophages il- <dig> effects a complex reprogramming of gene expression, with similar numbers of lysosomal genes being induced and suppressed. stat <dig>  however, appears to mediate only the activating effects of il- <dig> on lysosomal mrnas. in macrophages devoid of stat <dig> the induction of lysosomal genes by il- <dig> was blocked or severely reduced. on the other hand, in stat6-/- cells the suppressive effects of il- <dig> remained largely unchanged, pointing to an il- <dig> induced signaling branch that operates independently of stat <dig>  similar interdigitation of il- <dig> and stat <dig> signaling has been observed in the context of th <dig> differentiation  <cit> .

unexpectedly, the expression of  <dig> lysosomal genes was reduced by il- <dig> in stat6-deficient, but not in wild-type cells. stat <dig> thus acts both to mediate increased expression as well as to counteract an unknown, inhibitory pathway that is triggered by il- <dig>  these results reveal that the role of stat <dig> in this context is significantly broader than might have been expected from the number of il- <dig> induced genes alone. the mechanism behind this effect is not yet known. binding of stat <dig> to affected promoters might for example block access or regulation by il-4-induced inhibitory factors, compensate for the loss of other positive regulators, or counter the effects of repressive epigenetic alterations. stat <dig> deficiency in mouse t cells has been shown to cause a marked increase of trimethylated lysine- <dig> on histone  <dig> , indicating that stat <dig> supports transcription in part by antagonizing inhibitory chromatin modifications  <cit> . however, to what degree stat <dig> exerts this effect in macrophages still has to be explored in detail.

chip data show that about 70% of the lysosomal loci that are regulated by stat <dig> in macrophages have nearby stat <dig> binding sites, indicating that stat <dig> is likely exerting proximal effects in directing the expression of these targets. a similar number of stat <dig> sites near lysosomal genes have been identified in a chip-seq analysis in mouse th <dig> cells; however, very few of these genes were induced on the mrna level  <cit> . while phosphorylation on tyrosine  <dig> is sufficient to allow the binding of stat <dig> dimers to cognate dna elements, stat <dig> is unable to activate transcription on its own  <cit> , and it must cooperate with other proteins to promote gene expression  <cit> . in this context, activating chromatin modifications are likely to be important, as most stat <dig> peaks overlap with regions of histone h <dig> acetylation, and the most strongly regulated stat <dig> targets experience extensive expansions of h3k27ac marks in an il- <dig> and stat6-dependent manner. exactly what additional factors are involved in il-4/stat6-controlled lysosomal gene expression, and whether they act in concert with or downstream of stat <dig> remains to be studied.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding how the structure and function of organelles are molded during embryonic development and differentiation is a major goal of cell and developmental biology. the aim of this study was to identify transcriptional networks that are associated with the re-programming specifically of lysosome-related genes. through large-scale analyses of published microarray data we identified more than  <dig> dna-binding transcription factors whose expression correlates with significant numbers of lysosomal genes. affiliations identified in this manner indicate that mrnas for lysosomal genes are frequently modulated in concert with regulators that are active during of differentiation, development, interferon signaling and oxidative stress, suggesting broad re-programming of lysosomal genes in these contexts. depending on network structure, expression of transcription factors can correlate with their downstream target genes, and for most of the regulators identified here such directing roles in lysosomal gene control remains to be explored. however, stat <dig>  the strongest candidate emerging from our correlation analysis, was clearly identified as an upstream regulator for a large number of lysosomal genes in il- <dig> treated mouse macrophages. according to the effects of il- <dig>  lysosomal genes can be grouped into three principal categories ; lysosomal genes in category i are induced by il- <dig> through a stat6-dependent mechanism; genes in category ii tend to be suppressed by il- <dig>  but this effect is negated in the presence of stat6; category iii genes are suppressed by il- <dig> through a pathway operating independently of stat <dig>  in summary, this work illuminates the principal contexts of lysosomal gene regulation, identifies a novel pathway of lysosomal gene control and advances understanding of the cell and molecular biology of alternative macrophage differentiation.
