BACKGROUND
the paper mulberry  belongs to the family of moraceae and is naturally distributed in eastern asia and pacific countries. the paper mulberry has the shallow roots morphology with advanced lateral roots but without an obvious taproot. the paper mulberry is one of the multifunctional tree species in agroforestry systems  <cit> , as well as being one of the traditional forages  <cit>  and chinese medicines in many countries of asia  <cit> . it is the ideal tree species for ecological and gardening purposes  <cit> . due to its fast growth and adaptability, the paper mulberry is commonly used for the ecological afforestation and landscape in both sides of highway, mined areas and on barren land  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanism of strong adaptability and tolerance to biotic or abiotic stress of the paper mulberry has not been studied, which limits the exploitation of the paper mulberry.

in recent years, many reports have provided new and exciting information that has allowed us to better understand the genes involved in cold adaptation and freezing response  <cit> . one of the major advances in the past decade of cold tolerance research is the discovery of the cold stress related tfs. many tfs, including dreb  <cit> , myb  <cit> , nac  <cit>  and wrky  <cit> , have been found to be involved in the cold response of plants. recently, more and more researches concentrate on tf families involved in abiotic stress including cold stress response based on genome wide analyses, such as wrky  <cit> , nac  <cit> , myb  <cit>  and ap2/erf  <cit> . however, there are few reports on the role in cold responses of other tf families, such as arf, e2f, grf and gras, though their functions in development and growth have been characterized. moreover, most studies about cold stress in plants concentrate on a few species, such as arabidopsis  <cit>  and some crops  <cit> . the universality of the mechanism under tf control is not explicit, especially for tree species. because of low domestication, open-pollinated native populations and high levels of genetic variation, trees are ideal organisms to unveil the molecular basis of population adaptive divergence in nature and have gained much attention in recent years as non-classical model plants for environment adaptation, evolutionary and genomic studies  <cit> . a substantial number of ests  encoding putative transcription factors, including cbfs , are observed in eucalyptus under low temperature  <cit> . in subgroup iii of the ptwrky genes in populus, eight were induced expression under cold stress  <cit> . a comprehensive analysis of the nac gene family in populus revealed the functional divergence among members in nac family  <cit> . over-expression of jcerf or jcdreb, isolated from jatropha curcas, a woody oil plant, in transgenic arabidopsis exhibited enhanced salt and freezing stress responses  <cit> . bpdreb <dig>  cloned from the paper mulberry, could enhanced the freezing tolerance of arabidopsis significantly without causing growth retardation  <cit> . genetic diversity revealed by srap  marker and cluster analysis show that there is a relationship between the genetic variation and geographical distribution  <cit> . these results provide reference for making genetic map and guiding the breeding of the paper mulberry. in this study, we discern the potential transcriptional regulatory network regulated by the tfs in the seedlings of the paper mulberry from transcriptomic data under cold stress.

RESULTS
identification and classification of tfs in the paper mulberry under cold stress
tfs play the significant roles in plant development and stress tolerance. to identify the tfs involved in the cold stress response, we surveyed the biological functions of putative tfs that were differentially expressed in the paper mulberry under cold treatment. after retrieving annotation results for every unigene, there were total of  <dig>  tfs in the paper mulberry and classified into  <dig> families based on their dna-binding domains and other conserved motifs  <cit> . the expression level of all tfs was normalized by using their rpkm values. among of these, total of  <dig>  tfs, belonging to  <dig> families, were identified as being expressed in paper mulberry during cold stress . of these,  <dig> tfs had the complete orf  representing  <dig> % of the total .

under non-stress conditions,  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were expressed in the leaves. this number reached  <dig> after 2 hours of cold stress and  <dig>  after 6 hours. when 12 hours passed under low temperature, the number of expressed tfs was reduced to  <dig>  after 24 hours of exposure to cold, the number of expressed tfs was  <dig> . a total of  <dig> tfs were expressed in all five samples, representing  <dig> % of the total tfs. a relatively small number of tfs were uniquely expressed in each sample:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig> no. of expressed and differentially expressed tfs in each sample. a venn diagram of expressed tfs distributed in five samples b venn diagram of differentially expressed tfs in every sample. the time was represented the sample that were treated under cold stress. the former and latter number presented below the treat time, such as , was the number of tfs and families presented in this sample, respectively.



differentially expressed tfs the paper mulberry under cold stress
temperature is an important environmental factor that affects plant growth and development. temperature stresses include cold, freezing and heat. expression data from different plants species have indicated that the members of the tfs participate in plant responses to cold stresses. after four hours of cold treatment, a total of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs were identified in the well-developed leaf of vitis amurensis while  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs were identified in vitis vinifera  <cit> . the transcripts of  <dig> tfs from  <dig> tf families were responsive to cold stress in populus simonii  <cit> . when ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a desert shrub, was cultured at 4°c for 14 days, a total of  <dig> tfs were identified as degs,  <dig> of which showed significant up-regulation and  <dig> down-regulation  <cit> . in our study, a total of  <dig> tfs were responsive to cold stress, representing  <dig> % of the total number of tfs expressed in the paper mulberry .  <dig> tfs were expressed in all five samples, representing  <dig> % of the total differentially expressed tfs. the number of specifically expressed tfs was  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these results show that the number of tfs involved in cold response varies considerably among different tissues of different species under different conditions. this implies that the individual plant species have distinct cold response.

after 2 hours of cold stress treatment,  <dig> tfs showed differential expression characteristics, of which  <dig> tfs were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . the number of repressed tfs was significantly more than the number of induced expression tfs. compared with the untreated leaves, a total of  <dig> tfs were differentially expressed after 6 hours of cold stress treatment, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs. meanwhile, there were  <dig> differentially expressed tfs between 6 hours and 2 hours after cold stress treatment, with  <dig> up-regulated tfs and  <dig> down-regulated. after 12 hours of cold stress, the number of differentially expressed tfs  decreased dramatically compared with the untreated leaves, with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs. however, when comparing gene expression at 12 hours of cold exposure to 6 hours, there is a significant increase in the number of down-regulated tfs , which is more than the number of up-regulated tfs . this suggests that most of the tfs up-regulated at 6 hours were reduced upon another 6 hours of exposure to cold, and thus are only transiently activated in response to this stress. after 24 hours of cold stress treatment, there were  <dig> differential expression tfs, including  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs when compared with 12 hours of treatment.figure  <dig> cold stress responsive tfs between every two samples. taken pairwise comparison of 0 h vs 2 h as an example, up-regulated was referred to the expression was higher than that after 2 hours of cold stress treatment while down-regulated referred to the expression was lower than that after 2 hours of cold stress treatment.



to validate the transcriptomic data, we selected  <dig> tfs for confirmation by qpcr . the qpcr results suggested that the expression profile of the tfs were consistent with the transcriptomic data, though there was no biological replicate in the transcriptomic experiment. this was mainly benefit from using the clonal seedlings in this study.

family distribution of the differentially expressed tfs
a total of  <dig> differentially expressed tfs could be classified in to  <dig> families . the bhlh family contained the most differentially expressed tfs , followed by wrky , erf , myb , c2h <dig>  and nac . regarding the cpp , dbb , hrt , nf-yb , rav , srs , voz , whirly , yabby  families, all known members were responsive to cold stress. meanwhile, all the members of btf <dig>  camta, lsd, nf-x <dig> and s1fa family did not change in expression during cold stress treatment. however, according to the results of qpcr , three members of the camta family showed a significant expression difference in the early stage  of cold stress treatment though this was not detected in the transcriptomics data.figure  <dig> total and cold stress responsive tfs distributed in every family. “total tfs” referred to the total number of tfs in each family expressed in the leaf of the paper mulberry. “differentially expressed tfs” referred to the tfs with dramatic change in the leaf of the paper mulberry under cold stress. “percentage” referred to the percentage of the “differentially expressed tfs” number accounting for the “total tfs” number of each family.



there were  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families  responded to cold stress after 2 hours of treatment; most of these tfs showed a decrease in expression. for example, there were  <dig> down-regulated erf family tfs compared with  <dig> up-regulated;  <dig> down-regulated nac family members, and only one up-regulated; and  <dig> down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated wrky family tfs. total  <dig> families are involved in the cold stress response at 6 hours of treatment . whether it is compared with the untreated sample or with the 2 hours treated sample, the up-regulated tfs in most families increased significantly, while there was little to no change in the number of down-regulated tfs. for example, the number of up-regulated tfs in the wrky family increased to  <dig> and the number down-regulated reduced to  <dig> . after 12 hours of cold stress, there were  <dig> tf families that exhibited differential expression. for most families, when compared with the untreated leaf sample, the number of up-regulated tfs was clearly more than down-regulated tfs . however, the numbers of down-regulated tfs were significantly more than the up-regulated in the bhlh, wrky, erf, myb, c2h <dig>  nac and lbd families when compared with 6 hours cold stress treated leaf . the whirly , rav , and yabby  tf families emerged as having members with differential expression at this time, while the nf-yc and voz families were no longer expressed.figure  <dig> cold stress responsive tfs distributed in each family of every pairwise comparison. a-g family distribution in each pairwise comparison. numbers on the column represent the amount of up-and –down regulated tfs distributed in the family.



compared with the untreated leaf, a total of  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were differentially expressed in the leaf treated under cold stress for 24 hours. the numbers of up-regulated tfs was significantly more than that of down-regulated tfs in most families, except the bhlh family with  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated tfs . when compared with the leaf treated with cold stress after 12 hours, only  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families showed the differential expression traits at 24 hours of cold stress. the b <dig> family changed greatly with  <dig> tfs down-regulated and  <dig> up-regulated. regarding the erf, grf, hsf, nac and wrky families, the number of up-regulated tfs was obviously higher than that of down-regulated tfs. the tf family hrt  and nf-yc  emerged as having differentially regulated members after 24 hours of cold exposure, while the bbr-bpc, bes <dig>  eil, nf-yb, mads-box, rav, whirly, wox and yabby families were no longer expressed .

according above analysis, from  <dig> to 24 hours of cold stress treatment , the expression pattern of tfs in the ap2/erf, bhlh, myb, nac, and especially wrky families experienced a dramatic change. genes encoding  <dig> ap2/erf,  <dig> bhlh,  <dig> c2h <dig>   <dig> myb,  <dig> nac and 71wrky family members were responsive to cold stress in the paper mulberry, which comprise  <dig> % of the total cold-regulated tfs in this species , and the number of expressed tfs from these families obviously increased after the cold treatment while the number of the remaining families was almost same within each treatment sample . this result was similar with previous studies. for instance, in the mature pollen of arabidopsis, a total  <dig> tfs from eight families, including ap2/erf, bzip, bhlh, hd-zf myb, mads, nac, and wrky, have been reported to be involved in the cold stress response process  <cit> . in apical shoots of cassava subjected to cold, a total of  <dig> genes were identified as early cold-responsive tfs; ap2/erf, myb, and gras were the three major tf families involved in this process, with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> tfs represented, respectively  <cit> . the wrky  <cit> , nac  <cit> , myb  <cit>  and ap2/erf  <cit>  tf families have been characterized as being involved in abiotic stress, including cold stress response, based on genome-wide analyses and many intensive researches have revealed their significant roles in the cold stress response.

cold-inducible dreb1/cbfs, one of the subfamily in ap2/erf superfamily, have been identified from numerous plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , sheep grass  <cit> , barley  <cit> , prunus mume  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . the dreb1/cbf cold response pathway play a central role in cold acclimation. dreb1/cbf proteins bind to dre/crt elements in enhancers and activate transcription of target cold-inducible genes, including other transcription factors, and thus bring about transcriptomic and metabolomics changes, which eventually cause cold stress responses  <cit> . the dreb1/cbf function in cold tolerance by aba-dependent and aba independent pathway. meanwhile, under cold stress, an acute rise in cellular aba levels induces the expression of downstream genes which contain aba-responsive cis elements in their promoters, represented by various types of tfs, such as bzip, myb, and myc. myb proteins are a superfamily of tfs that have known regulatory roles in developmental processes and defense responses in plants  <cit> . the hos <dig> gene encodes an r2r3-type myb and works as an important coordinating factor for responses to cold stress  <cit> . expression of osmyb <dig> was up-regulated by cold and the osmyb <dig> overexpressing plants were more tolerant against cold stress than wild type plants  <cit> . cold stimulates the activation of ntl <dig>  a nac family tf, which induces a subset of pr genes and the transgenic exhibited enhanced disease resistance  <cit> . this indicates that the mechanism by which these paralogous tfs mediate stress tolerance is complex in plants, though these tfs can bind to the same core recognition sequence  <cit> .

transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing gmwrky <dig> shows increased tolerance to cold stress when compared with wild-type plants  <cit> . recent research suggest that the three structurally related wrky proteins, atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  participate in at least three phytohormone-mediated signaling pathways, including sa , ja  and aba   <cit> , two closely related wrky transcription factors  respond to both biotic and abiotic stresses, e.g. p. syringae, nacl, cold and heat  <cit> .

cross-talk and mutual regulations exist among these tfs. cbf2/dreb1c negatively regulates cbf1/dreb1b and cbf3/dreb1a, ensuring that their expression is tightly controlled, which, in turn, guarantees the proper induction of downstream genes and the accurate development of arabidopsis tolerance to freezing and related stresses  <cit> . the cold regulation of cbf <dig> involves upstream bhlh  <cit>  and myb  <cit>  factors. cold stress induces simulation of ice <dig> at k <dig>  which is critical for ice1-mediated activation of transcription of cbfs and repression of myb <dig>  cbfs regulate the expression of cor genes that confer freezing tolerance. the expression of cbfs is negatively regulated by myb <dig> and zat <dig>  <cit> . the myb <dig> protein interacts with ice <dig> and binds to myb recognition sequences in the promoters of cbf genes, which suggest myb <dig> is part of a complex network controlling the expression of cbfs in response to cold stress  <cit> . camta <dig>  one member of the calmodulin binding transcription activator  family, binds to the cm <dig> motif and works as a positive regulator of cbf <dig>  <cit> . atwrky <dig> negatively mediates cold sensitivity of mature arabidopsis pollen through regulating the expression of genes encoding cbf family transcriptional activators  <cit> . therefore, we inferred that the ap2/erf, bhlh, c2h <dig>  myb, nac and wrky family members interacted with aba, ja and other of phytohormone might play the central and significant roles during cold stress response in the paper mulberry.

in addition, there were still many tfs distributed in other small tf families, such as arf, dbb, g2-like, lbd, wox the g2-like, grf, lbd, wox and yabby , even though they have been characterized primarily for their participation in the regulation of plant photo-morphogenesis, development and growth. most members of these families also showed changes in expression upon exposure to cold, suggesting they also have important roles in cold stress tolerance in the paper mulberry.

the arf tfs play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including development, growth, cell division and responses to environmental stimuli  <cit> . atgrf <dig> is required for the development of appropriate leaf size and shape through the promotion and/or maintenance of cell proliferation activity in leaf primordial  <cit> . cold stress inhibits shoot-ward auxin transport and alters the intracellular auxin gradient  <cit> . however, knowledge about its role under cold stress is limited. a total of  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated arfs might function as the positive and negative regulator by sensing the auxin signal in the paper mulberry under cold stress.

bbx  proteins are key factors in regulatory networks controlling growth and developmental processes that include seedling photomorphogenesis, photoperiodic regulation of flowering, shade avoidance, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . their functions are not entirely redundant, as judged by the fact that some dbbs were apparently implicated in light signal transduction in a negative manner, whereas another was implicated in a positive manner with regard to light-induced inhibition of elongation of hypocotyls  <cit> . for instance, bbx <dig> and bbx <dig> function as transcriptional co-repressors, forming inactive heterodimers with hy <dig>  that down-regulate bbx <dig> expression for fine-tuning of light-mediated seedling development  <cit> . therefore, five dbbs are thought to play regulated roles, respectively in the photomorphogenesis of the paper mulberry under cold stress.

g2-like  tfs are required for chloroplast development and have been reported to co-regulate and synchronize the expression of a suite of nuclear photosynthetic genes and thus act to optimize photosynthetic capacity in varying environmental and developmental conditions  <cit> . although no study has reported that g2-like are related to cold stress, fifteen g2-like tfs were induced and eight had repressed expression exposure to cold, which suggests they may function to regulate chloroplast development in the paper mulberry under cold stress.

the lbd family is of plant-specific and implicated in plant development. two members of the arabidopsis lbd family, lbd <dig> and lbd <dig> are expressed in immature tracheary elements , and their expression is dependent on vnd <dig> and vnd <dig>  which are nac family tfs required for te differentiation. asl <dig> appears to be involved in a positive feedback loop for vnd <dig> expression that regulates te differentiation-related gene  <cit> . four lbd genes downstream of arfs, lbd <dig>  lbd <dig>  lbd <dig> and lbd <dig>  are rapidly and dramatically induced by callus-inducing medium; lbd as key regulators in the callus induction process, thereby establishing a molecular link between auxin signaling and the plant regeneration program  <cit> . in addition, bhlh <dig> post-translated regulates the function of lob  at lateral organ boundaries  <cit> . however, tcp tfs play a pivotal role in the control of morphogenesis of shoot organs by negatively regulating the expression of boundary specific genes, including lbds  <cit> . there are  <dig> lbds highly expressed in the leaf of the paper mulberry under cold stress and this might account for the advanced lateral organ development in the paper mulberry even in the cold or other hostile environment.

the wox tfs have been identified to function in sam  and ram  by a dynamic feedback loop involving the clavata <dig>  peptide ligand and the clv <dig> receptor in sam  <cit> . the dwt <dig> tillers have shorter internodes with fewer and un-elongated cells compared with the wild type; further study showed that the dwt <dig>  activity in the internode elongation is directly or indirectly associated with ga  signaling, suggesting a new function of wox genes in balancing branch growth in rice  <cit> . overexpression of wox <dig> induced ectopic expression of knotted 1‑like homeobox <dig>  genes in leaves and consequently produced a phenotype similar to plants ectopically expressing knoxi genes  <cit> . however, hos <dig>  encoding the wox <dig>  is important for growth and development, and for a part of freezing tolerance, by affecting the activity of genes independent of the cbf pathway in arabidopsis  <cit> . this is the only report that wox tfs are involved in the cold response. in our study, three of five genes encoding wox tfs were induced by cold exposure. up-expression of these genes implied that they might have important roles in cambial meristems during leaf growth and development of the paper mulberry under cold stress.

thus, tfs of the arf, dbb, g2-like, lbd, wox, yabby and other families, interacted with auxin, ga and other various hormones, were thought to be essential for the regulation of photo-morphogenesis, growth and development of the paper mulberry under cold stress.

clustering of the differentially expressed tfs and the identification of key tfs
discerning the expression pattern and the regulatory cascades of the tfs will be benefit for the identification of key tfs that mediating the activation of downstream genes during cold stress from  <dig> to 24 hours in the paper mulberry. so, according to the expression profiles, the  <dig> differentially expressed tfs were clustered into three groups, namely early, intermediate and late responsive groups . besides, the key tfs was screened from these three groups following the threshold: fold change was more than ten or the difference value of rpkm was more than  <dig> figure  <dig> heat map of differentially expressed tfs under cold stress. to be considered differentially expressed, the transcript must have rpkm ≥  <dig> in at least one tissue, 2-fold or greater change, and p ≤  <dig> . according to their expression pattern under cold stress, the differentially expressed tfs were categorized in to  <dig> groups and  <dig> subgroups. the number at the left of the heat map  represented the amount of the families, differentially expressed tfs and the percentage of the total differential expressed tfs in each group, respectively. yellow indicates high expression, black indicates intermediate expression, and blue indicates low expression.



tfs in group  <dig> was early responsive to cold stress at 2 hour, including  <dig> up-regulated  and  <dig> down-regulated . subgroup  <dig> is characterized by a rapid induction of expression at 2 hours of cold treatment, followed by a slight decrease in expression for the duration of the experiment. this group contained  <dig> tf accounting for  <dig> % of the total. a total of  <dig> tfs in subgroup  <dig> clearly underwent transcriptional repression as the cold stress began . among of these  <dig> tfs, one up-regulated bhlh , and two down-regulated erfs  were considered to playing key role in the early activation of downstream genes. in addition, according to the results of qpcr,  <dig> camtas were highly induced to express under cold stress at 15 min or 30 min , though they were not detected in the transcriptomic data. even though, this was consistent with the fact that ca2+ is the second message of cold stress and camta is one of the pathways that senses cold stress downstream of ca2+ signal transduction. because the transduction of ca2+ signal is rapid and the balance of intracellular calcium concentration is critical, the induced expression of camta is always fast and transient  <cit> . thus, three camtas were also considered to be the primary key tfs that sensed and transduced the cold stress signal.figure  <dig> the family composition of each subgroup in the heat map. the number represented the amount of the differentially expressed tfs in each family.



the intermediate group  contained  <dig> differentially expressed tfs that obviously began in response to cold stress since 6 hours. according to the expression profile, group  <dig> has been divided into  <dig> subgroup, of which group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was up-regulated while group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was down-regulated . a total of  <dig> tfs were categorized as subgroup  <dig>  these genes remained relatively stable through 2 hours after induction of cold stress, but increased suddenly at 6 hours and remained at heightened expression until 12 hours of cold stress. then the expression gradually decreased to the level of untreated leaves after 24 hours treatment. subgroup  <dig> contained a total of  <dig> tfs that were induced at 6 hours treatment of cold exposure, but the expression of these genes was decreased again by 12 hours of treatment, though their expression levels were relatively high again at 24 hours of treatment. the members of subgroup  <dig> were up-regulated rapidly at 6 hours treatment and then sharply declined. it contained  <dig> tf and was the largest subgroup, representing  <dig> % of the total.

a total of  <dig> tfs are contained in subgroup  <dig>  these genes have a gradual decrease in expression until 6 hours of exposure to cold, at which point they reached their lowest level of expression. at 12 hours of treatment, they reached their highest expression levels and then gradually returned to the pretreatment or slightly lower than pre-treatment levels by 24 hours. in subgroup  <dig>  which contains  <dig> tfs, expression levels began to rise or slightly fluctuate from  <dig> to 2 hours cold stress treatment. they were then reduced to the lowest levels at 6 hours of treatment. after that, expression gradually increased and returned to relatively high levels by 24 hours of cold exposure. unlike the tfs in subgroup  <dig> and  <dig>  those showing subgroup  <dig> expression profiles remained relatively stable after suppressed expression at 6 hours of cold stress. this subgroup includes  <dig> tf belonging to  <dig> families.

in group  <dig>  total  <dig> tfs were considered to be the key tfs mediating downstream genes in the intermediate stage of cold stress . among of them, there were  <dig> tfs were induced expression, including  <dig> bhlh,  <dig> erfs, one hsf,  <dig> mybs,  <dig> nacs and  <dig> wrkys, which mainly functioned in abiotic stress response  <cit> . meanwhile, total  <dig> tfs were significantly suppressed expression, such as arr-b, b <dig>   <dig> bhlhs,  <dig> c2h <dig>   <dig> co-like,  <dig> erf,  <dig> hd-zip,  <dig> yabbys, g2-like, gata, gras and tcp. many of these tfs have been reported play important roles in growth and development of lateral organ or apical meristem  <cit>  as well as the photosynthesis  <cit> . these result suggested that, at the intermediate stage under cold stress, low temperature began to repress the development and growth of vegetative organ in the paper mulberry. simultaneously, the paper mulberry initiated more stress related genes to enhance the cold tolerance.

group  <dig>  namely late responsive group, contained  <dig> tfs that were clustered into subgroup  <dig> and  <dig>  these two subgroups were significantly up-regulated at the  <dig> and 24 hours of treatment, respectively. a total of  <dig> tfs were in subgroup  <dig> and belonged to  <dig> tf families accounting for  <dig> % of the total. there were  <dig> tfs in subgroup  <dig>  belonging to  <dig> families and accounting for  <dig> % of the total. in late responsive group, total  <dig> tfs were defined as the key tfs functioning in the terminal stage because of their great changes of rpkm value just beginning from  <dig> or 24 hours cold stress , including  <dig> arr-b, c3h,  <dig> co-like, 2 g2-like,  <dig> hsfs,  <dig> nacs and tcp. most of them presented the up-regulated expression, which implied that the expression level of a large number of tfs went back to the originally expressed status and only a few of them were highly expressed to be responsible for the recovery growth and continuous cold stress.

based on the above differential expression analysis, the proposed cold response regulatory cascades under the regulation of tfs in the paper mulberry was illustrated in figure  <dig>  after signal reception, stress-activated ca2+ signaling and other secondary signal modulate the expression of early cold stress responsive tfs. one bhlh, two erfs and three camtas played the key roles in the primary signal transduction. after that, at the intermediate stage of cold stress, there were mainly two biological processes that were regulated by tfs, namely cold stress resistance and the growth homeostasis. on the one hand, much cold stress related genes could be repressed or induced by tfs, such as wrky, hsf, erf, nac, myb, etc., which played the central roles in endowing paper mulberry with the cold tolerance by regulating the content of osmoprotectant, including soluble sugar, proline and so on. on the other hand, the major growth physical process, e.g. photosynthesis, chloroplast malfunction, cell division in cambial meristem and lateral organ development, were mainly regulated by yabby, wox, lbd, dbb, grf, etc., which made the growth state of paper mulberry reach to a new homeostasis. of cause, the crosstalk and the intricate regulation network could exist in these processes. at the late stage of cold stress, the expression of most tfs restored to the level before cold stress. a few of tfs, mainly concentrated in the arr-b, co-like, g2-like and tcp families, were drastically induced expression to respond to the new growth homeostasis under low temperature stress.figure  <dig> the supposed regulated network under the control of tfs of the paper mulberry exposed to cold stress. after signal reception, stress-activated ca2+ signaling and other signaling modulate the expression of stress-responsive transcription factors. the thick arrows show different biological processes in the stress response under the control of tfs. the key tfs was included in the ellipse drawing by green line. blue front tfs represented the repressed expressed tfs and the red front tfs represented the induced expression tfs. the blue line between tfs showed in the intermediate response group presented the existed the interaction among these tfs.



CONCLUSIONS
our study is the comprehensive transcriptomic-wide identification of cold stress-responsive tfs in the paper mulberry. total of  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were responded to cold stress and they were clustered into three groups, namely early, intermediate and late responsive groups. the key tfs were also screened as playing the important roles in three stages. in addition, based on the analysis, the ap2/erf, bhlh, myb, nac and wrky families play central and significant roles during cold stress response in the paper mulberry just as in other species, as many members of these families are up-regulated during exposure to cold. the finding indicates a substantial conservation of tf families that regulate cold stress response across different species of plant. in addition, we identified many other tf families previously associated with growth and development, including arf, dbb, g2-like, grf, gras, lbd, wox and yaaby, which exhibit obviously altered expression under cold stress in the paper mulberry. although it seemed that their important roles in the cold stress response have been neglected, these proteins might contribute to the regulation of cold response in this species. this study provides us the profile of the tfs involved in the cold stress adaptation of the paper mulberry and also highlights that many plant growth and development related tfs are affected by cold stress, suggesting the potential of using these tfs to improve the plant growth under cold conditions instead of simply enhancing the cold stress tolerance.
