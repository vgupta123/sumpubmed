BACKGROUND
the complete genome sequence of the mycobacterium tuberculosis , h37rv, has been determined and its bioinformatic analysis improved our understanding of the life-cycle of this facultative, intracellular, human pathogen  <cit> . although re-annotation of the genome sequence of m. tb strain, h37rv, changed some assignments, the significant portion of the annotation remained unchanged  <cit> .

bioinformatic analysis has allowed us to predict the function for  <dig> proteins out of  <dig>  and more than  <dig> of these have been experimentally identified in mycobacterial function. among the  <dig> conserved hypothetical proteins,  <dig> putative proteins showed no similarity to any known protein and it is possible that some of them may be specific to m. tb only  <cit> . in h37rv, among many virulence factors, it was predicted that tlya gene is a part of an operon containing at least three other genes viz. the first being tlya , second is ppnk  and the third is recn , homologous to e. coli recn  <cit> . since h37rv is a well characterized pathogen, an obvious question surfaces about the role of rv <dig>  with respect to its pathogenicity and virulence because during the initial annotation, rv <dig> was predicted to be a  <dig> amino acid long, hemolytic protein, which may function as a virulence determinant as it showed homology with the tlya gene products of swine pathogen serpulina hyodysenteriae, a causative agent of swine dysentery and almost identical to tlya of mycobacterium leprae  <cit> . this annotation was consistent with experimental observations that described the presence of hemolytic molecules in m. tb. for example, king and co-workers detected contact dependent hemolytic activity in the virulent strain h37rv which was reduced by several fold in attenuated strain h37ra, and not present in vaccine strain bcg  <cit> . moreover, two more proteins of m. tb, which showed homology with phospholipase c of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 30% homology to hemolysin a, precursor of vibreo cholerae, which have been reported to possess hemolytic activity  <cit> . in addition, wren et al. showed the presence of tlya homologues in m. tb, mycobacterium leprae, mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium bovis bcg, but appeared to be absent in non-pathogenic strain mycobacterium smegmatis. interestingly, introduction of the tlya gene into mycobacterium smegmatis using a mycobacterial shuttle expression plasmid increased the contact dependent hemolysis orchestrated by it  <cit> . however, no further information is available on rv <dig> until recent studies showed that rv <dig> functions as a ribosomal rna methyltransferase  <cit> . the methylase activity resulted in methylation of ribosomal rna which can alter the susceptibility to capreomycin, a macrocyclic peptide antibiotic. it has been observed that mutations in the tlya gene may make the bacteria resistant towards capreomycin  <cit> . hence, the question arises as to whether the tlya is a hemolysin or a ribosomal methyltransferase or it is a dually active molecule.

multi-functionality for a protein can arise due to the presence of distinct/separate domains to carry out an individual function or upon post-translational modification such as proteolytic cleavage which may result in acquisition of a new function. in the present example rv <dig> has been suspected to possess two entirely diverse activities i.e. haemolytic and rna methylation activities, which is rather unusual. since mycobacterium can have a complicated external environment after entry into macrophages, the role of an individual protein like rv <dig> needs a thorough characterization in order to decipher its location specific function during the initial phase of infection. such studies are important to prove or disprove its diverse/distinct functions to correlate its probable role in pathogenicity of m. tb. the present study is aimed at answering the following questions viz.,  can this protein be present in two distinct locations and perform two diverse functions?  if yes, any other molecule assist this protein to perform these diverse functions?  how the hemolytic function is orchestrated by it?

the answers to the above questions can be unambiguously obtained only with the help of detailed characterization of rv <dig> as purified rv <dig>  per se, must exhibit the said activities under in vitro, conditions. in this manuscript, we have presented several experimental evidences which clearly show that the rv <dig> has membrane destabilizing activity as well as the rna methyltransferase activity.

RESULTS
homology of rv <dig> of m. tb
rv <dig>  tlya gene product of h37rv, is an alkaline protein that has >40% similarity with other cytotoxins/hemolysins. initial annotation has referred the tlya gene product as a cytotoxin/hemolysin homologue and it was classified as a hypothetical 'pore forming hemolysin'. the multiple sequence alignment of tlya gene products of other pore forming hemolysins is shown in figure 1a. for example, the identity amounts to ~38% with serpulina hyodysenteriae and ~32% with helicobacter pylori  <cit> . in addition, the rv <dig> also contains a motifs that align well with rrna methyltransferase and rna binding proteins as it displays considerable homology with ftsj/rrmj  of e. coli as shown in figure 1b <cit> . another common feature seen in the alignment of large rrmj class was that only four residues, corresponding to the k38-d124-k164-e <dig> tetrad in e. coli rrmj, are invariant and were common to several families of site specific methyltransferases that modify 2'-hydroxyl groups of ribose moieties of ribosomal rna. since rv <dig> also has well conserved k69-d154-k182-e <dig> tetrad, it has been re-annotated as rrna methyltransferase  <cit> . currently, the national center for biotechnology information, usa has listed the rv <dig> as a member of cog <dig>  which were predicted to be rrna methylating enzymes. it is note worthy that both hemolysins of s. hyodysenteria and h. pylori also have the k-d-k-e tetrad  as shown in figure 1a. hence, the tlya gene product exhibits homology with two diverse classes of proteins viz. hemolysin/cytolysin as well as ribosomal rna methyltransferases.

cloning, expression and purification of rv1694
the full-length gene of rv <dig>  was cloned in pt7nc  and pet28a  vectors as shown in figure. 2a and was expressed in e. coli bl <dig> codonplus-ripl. the e. coli were routinely induced with  <dig> mm iptg at 28°c and significant amount of the rv <dig> bearing the 6-histidine tag was isolated from the soluble fraction with the help of ni-nta affinity column. the purity was consistently found to be >95% as judged by 12% sds-page . the average yield of the purified protein was ~ <dig>  mg per liter of culture. figure 2c shows the identification of rv <dig> with immune rabbit serum raised against it. the circular-dichroic spectrum of purified rv <dig> indicated the presence of 23% of α-helix, 33% of β-sheet and 37% of random coil . we have also confirmed the integrity of the protein by tryptic digestion and maldi-toff analysis which was in excellent agreement with data base sequences present in expasyhttp://au.expasy.org/tools/peptide-mass.html . the cd data was also consistent with a homology model shown in figure 3b, which was built with swiss-model server using 3hp7a.pdb as template which represents the putative hemolysin from streptococcus thermophilus  <cit> .

rv <dig> has hemolytic activity
e. coli has no natural homolog of rv <dig>  thus, it was not expected to exhibit any contact dependent hemolysis of red blood cells. in order to confirm the hemolytic activity of rv <dig> expressing e. coli, we have analyzed both of our constructs  for contact dependent haemolytic property. the data in figure 4a represents the contact dependent hemolysis of rabbit rbcs  in comparison to uninduced and mock vector  transformed e. coli. consistent hemolysis of rrbcs was observed in ~ <dig> hrs of incubation time.

we have also examined the specific activity of purified rv <dig>  shown in figure 4b. the amount of rv <dig> needed for 50% hemolysis, in  <dig> hrs, was ~ <dig>  μmug/ml while the maximum lysis observable was ~70%. the time taken to achieve hemolysis was rather long but consistent with slow contact dependent hemolysis observed in the published literature mentioned earlier. the slow lysis could be due to slow transfer/assembly of rv <dig> from e. coli to rbc membrane, when compared to conventional hemolysins such as aerolysin or staphylococcal α-hemolysin which assemble on target cells within minutes as they are secreted from the corresponding bacterium  <cit> . since, rv <dig> contains two cysteine residues; the role of these cys residues in the hemolysis was also examined in presence of reducing agents. interestingly, the hemolytic activity was reduced by ~ <dig>  fold to that of the non-reduced form as shown in figure 4b. this observation suggests that the hemolytic activity of rv <dig> is dependent on intact disulfide bond.

the above mentioned data on haemolysis, shown in figure 4b, highlights that the rv <dig> is monomeric protein before binding to the cell membranes and it readily oligomerizes after binding to target membranes. in order to rule out any pre-existent, loose, oligomeric aggregates responsible for the haemolysis of rrbcs in our experiments, we have generated the rv <dig> by in vitro transcription and translation  and examined for hemolytic property. the data in figure 4c shows the haemolytic activity of rv <dig> generated by ivtt, which is unambiguous and consistent with the slow hemolysis data shown in figures 4a and 4b. we have also examined the hemolysis of human rbcs and it was observed that the human rbcs were also susceptible to lysis by rv <dig> .

visualization of rv <dig> on e. coli surface
since rv <dig> expressing e. coli showed contact dependent hemolysis, it was important to localize by staining the e. coli expressing the rv <dig> with rabbit antiserum specific to it. the confocal microscopic pictures of e. coli stained for the rv <dig> are shown in figure 5a. strikingly, the rv <dig> was present on the outer cell wall of e. coli as seen from the specific staining of the polyclonal antibody raised by us. it is important to note that neither mock transformed e. coli  nor secondary antibody used in the study showed any staining. these vital controls unambiguously prove the presence of rv <dig> on the cell wall.

we next examined whether the immune serum of rv <dig> can inhibit the contact dependent hemolytic activity of e. coli expressing the rv <dig>  as shown in figure 5b, the hemolysis was reduced by about 50% in comparison to the hemolysis in the absence of immune serum. the observed inhibition of hemolysis by the immune serum was specific as pre-immune serum of the same rabbit had no effect on the contact dependent hemolytic activity of the e. coli expressing the rv <dig>  these observations suggest that the rv <dig> was expressed on the cell wall of e. coli and the anti-rv <dig> antibody neutralizes the contacts needed for the assembly and lysis.

binding and oligomerization of rv <dig> on rbc membranes
we further examined whether or not rv <dig> can form ordered oligomers which must be present and responsible for the slow but consistent hemolysis observed by us. hydropathy plot analysis of rv <dig> primary sequence has revealed that there are two probable transmembrane regions viz. amino acids 67- <dig> and 150- <dig>  to confirm the binding and oligomerization of rv <dig> to rbc membranes, we have incubated the rv <dig> with rrbcs, isolated the membrane fragments and visualized its oligomeric forms by sds-page. the rv <dig> showed strong binding to rrbc membranes and formed stable oligomers which were easily detectable with anti-6-histidine antibody . the oligomers of rv <dig> showed concentration dependency and the kinetics of oligomerization on rrbc membranes was found to be slow in comparison to well studied, conventional hemolysins.

the data shown in figure 6a and 6b lets us infer that the rv <dig> can form oligomers ranging from dimers, to heptamers based on the mobility identified with anti-6-histidine antibody. the oligomers formed on rbc membranes were found to be resistant to temperatures up to 100°c and 4% sds very much like the oligomers of staphylococcal α-hemolysin , but significant dissociation of the oligomer was observed in the presence of reducing agent. this result suggests that the hemolytic activity of rv <dig> was due to the formation of stable oligomers on target cell membranes only and the intermolecular disulfide bond may be necessary for the oligomerization.

rv <dig> binds to and oligomerizes on macrophage phagosomal membranes
earlier studies have suggested that the m. tuberculosis, after entry into macrophages, appears to compromise the integrity of phagosomal membranes for its survival. to understand any possible role for rv <dig> in this process, we have examined the binding and oligomerization of rv <dig> on phagosomes isolated from raw <dig>  cells for different time periods i.e.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> min. in figure 6c, the presence of lamp- <dig>   <dig> kda phagolysosome glycoprotein protein marker, authenticates our phagosomal preparation. the rv <dig> showed strong binding to the phagosomal membranes and formed stable oligomers, which are very similar to the ones seen on rrbcs including their stability in 4% sds and susceptibility to near boiling temperatures under non-reducing conditions. moreover, unboiled samples prove the absence of any pre-existing oligomer of rv <dig> added to phagosomal preparation. in summary, all these observations suggest that the rv <dig> has the ability to bind to target membranes such as phagosomal membranes and can form multimeric structures for destabilization. in this process it appears that a disulfide bond seems to play a key role.

limited proteolysis of rv1694
limited proteolysis provides valuable information regarding the existence of stable domains of proteins/regions and also susceptible regions that might be protected against proteolysis upon interaction with other proteins or cell membranes. keeping this in mind, we have digested the rv <dig> with proteinase k in presence and absence of membrane for different time periods and examined the resultant protein fragments by sds-page. the sds-page gels were stained with coomassie brilliant blue and also by immuno blotting with anti-6-histidine antibody. as shown in figure 7a, after  <dig> min of proteinase k digestion, there were two prominent bands of size around  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda, which seem to be resistant to further digestion as seen with coomassie brilliant blue staining. however, the cleavage pattern of rv <dig>  shown in figure 7b, obtained with anti-6-histidine antibody suggests that the amino terminal of the rv <dig> was more susceptible to proteases such as proteinase k. it should be noted that any cleavage at the carboxy terminus cannot be detected with the anti-6-histidine antibody. limited proteolysis of rv <dig>  bound to the rbc membrane, has yielded the pattern suggestive of inaccessibility of the amino terminus as we could see the intact protein in the shorter time frames . the proteolytic patterns were also consistent with the model of rv <dig> shown in figure 3b. as shown in figure 3b, the two visible domains of rv <dig> viz. n-terminal domain consisting of  <dig> to ~ <dig> amino acids and the second domain of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids are connected by amino acid segment with two arg residues, which are generally susceptible to trypsin or proteinase k like enzymes. if a protease nicks the region between two domains, it should result in a domain that is smaller by  <dig> kd i.e. ~ <dig> kd . in summary, the amino-terminal of the rv <dig> protein was more accessible to the proteinase k in the soluble state that becomes inaccessible when bound to the target membranes.

rv <dig> is a ribosomal rna methylase
in order to evaluate the ribosomal rna methyltransferase activity of rv <dig>  we attempted several approaches as described below:

capreomycin inhibits the growth of e. coli transformed with rv1694
in our first approach, we monitored the growth rates of e. coli expressing the rv <dig> and mock vector  transformed e. coli without or with capreomycin  as shown in figure 8a. in the presence of capreomycin, the mock vector transformed e. coli growth was retarded by only ~10% while the e. coli expressing the rv <dig> construct did not grow efficiently . we also ensured that these cultures expressed the rv <dig> by examining for hemolysis at each time point for the data plotted . this experiment confirms the rv <dig> mediated methylation of ribosomal rna of e. coli under in vivo conditions, as the mock vector transformed control has practically showed no dramatic retardation of growth in the presence of capreomycin.

capreomycin inhibits in vitro translation of s <dig> extract of rv <dig> transformed e. coli
in the second approach, we also analyzed the in vivo methylation activity of rv <dig> by coupled in vitro transcription-translation with capreomycin. in this experiment, we prepared the s <dig> extracts of e. coli expressing the rv <dig> along with controls. the s <dig> extract was supplemented with all necessary components to monitor the translation of the s <dig> extract in the presence and absence of capreomycin. we have used the supercoiled plasmid of α-hemolysin of staphylococcus aureus as a reporter to examine the translational activity of the s <dig> extract as staphylococcal α-hemolysin is very efficient in inducing the lysis of rrbcs. also, the kinetics of hemolysis of α-hemolysin was well established and very fast in comparison to the kinetics of lysis of rv <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the assay is fast and reliable as the efficiency of translation by way of lysis of rbcs can be compared with the values reported in the literature and does not require any specialized equipment or reagents.

we have carried out the in vitro transcription and translation experiments at two different concentrations of capreomycin , in order to closely match the observations reported earlier  <cit> . in figure 8b, in the absence of capreomycin, the translational efficiency of s <dig> extracts of rv <dig> expressing e. coli and mock vector e. coli showed nearly identical translational efficiency of the staphylococcal α-hemolysin reporter  and this value was taken as 100% translation efficiency. at  <dig> ng/ml capreomycin, the s <dig> extract made from rv <dig> expressing e. coli showed reduced translation  i.e. considerable loss of hemolysis  where as the mock vector transformed e. coli showed no loss of translation . at  <dig> ng/ml capreomycin concentration, the s <dig> extract made from rv <dig> expressing e. coli showed no translation of reporter , whereas the vector transformed e. coli showed about 26% lysis  compared to the translation without capreomycin. it should be noted that the e. coli is partially sensitive to capreomycin at higher concentrations i.e. > <dig> ng/ml. this experiment, once again, confirms the ribosomal rna methylation activity of rv <dig> 

in vitro methylation activity of rv <dig> on ribosome
in addition to capreomycin sensitivity assays described above, we have also examined the incorporation of radioactive methyl group of s-adenosylmethionine  into the ribosomal rna by rv <dig>  in this assay, we have used crude ribosomes as substrate for rv <dig> in the presence of the methyl group donor  and judged the extent of methylation reaction. assay was carried out with and without rv <dig> and ribosomes under native and heat denatured conditions. it was clear from figure 8c that the native ribosome, in the presence of purified rv <dig>  has  <dig> % more methylation in comparison to ribosomal preparation alone. however, heat denatured ribosomes, in the presence of purified rv <dig>  didn't show any significant incorporation of the methyl group of -sam in comparison to the heat denatured ribosomes alone. this result, once again, confirmed that the purified rv <dig> was also ribosomal rna methylase and it transfers the methyl group from s-adenosylmethionine to rrna.

discussion
the aim of the present study is to decipher the other face of mycobacterial rv <dig> which has been attributed with ribosomal rna methylation activity.

the data presented in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which assessed the activity of rv <dig> under in vitro conditions, unequivocally, confirm the other feature of rv <dig> i.e. its membrane destabilizing attribute. firstly, the e. coli harbouring the tlya has clearly exhibited hemolysis much like the mycobacterial strain studied earlier. this observation also implies that the cellular localization of rv <dig> is nearly same in both m. tb and e. coli which may involve common transport mechanism. noteworthy feature of our confocal data was that the rv <dig> was exported to the cell wall of e. coli despite the absence of any signal sequence. secondly, the purified protein also exhibited unambiguous hemolysis under in vitro conditions  which was sensitive to the presence of reducing agents. the hemolytic activity of the purified protein was reduced drastically in the presence of reducing agents indicating the need for the presence of an intact disulfide bond. moreover, rv <dig> irreversibly binds to and oligomerizes on red blood cell membrane and was resistant to heat and sds very much like the conventional hemolysins but unlike them, the oligomers of rv <dig> dissociate in the presence of thiol-reducing agents. while reducing agents abolish the activity by 90% and the residual activity seen in figure 4a could be due to the presence of higher order oligomers  which were found to be un-dissociable. unfortunately, these oligomers were rigid and did not fly well in maldi-toff spectrometers for deeper analysis. moreover, consistent with the haemolytic nature, the data in figure 6b and figure 6c revealed the rv1694's ability to bind to and oligomerize on isolated phagosomal membranes also. this oligomerization was once again sensitive to reducing agents. our limited proteolysis data also revealed that the amino terminus was more exposed to proteases in solution while it was found to be inaccessible when it was membrane bound. hence, a reasonable working model for the contact dependent haemolytic property of e. coli expressing the rv <dig> could be due to contacts between e. coli and target membranes through the insertion of its amino terminus in the target membrane while its carboxy terminus could be anchored to host cell wall. overall, the hemolytic property of this protein was due to ordered assembly of this protein on target cell membranes through its hydrophobic pockets than due to any pre-existing aggregate as the rv <dig>  generated by in vitro transcription and translation, also exhibited unambiguous hemolysis. our data also rules out the role of any unidentified protein complexing with the rv <dig> for the observed haemolytic activity as the oligomers seen in our sds-page gels were composed of homo-oligomers of rv <dig> as the molecular weights of the oligomers were consistent with the multimeric forms of rv <dig>  in support of this, the sds-page of oligomers, after boiling in presence of reducing agents  has yielded the corresponding monomeric rv <dig> 

in general, more than one third of bacterial pore forming toxins act as common virulence factors for the host pathogenic bacteria. these toxins have two distinct states: a water soluble form before oligomerization and a transmembrane form after oligomerization and conversion between these two states do not require any assistance from chaperones but require a hydrophobic milieu. on the other hand the data presented here on rv <dig> is interesting as it does not have any classical signal sequence like the conventional secreted forms of hemolysins. in this regard, the data reported by bloom's group had highlighted this possibility. these authors have shown that the live bcg organisms were able to orchestrate phagosomal membrane permeability which can allow uptake of molecules upto  <dig> kd  <cit> . this observation suggests the role of a hemolysin like or membrane destabilizing molecule after successful entry into macrophages. the need for the association of rv <dig> with phagosome compartments is also important in the context for understanding the mhc class i presentation which requires antigen localized to the cytoplasmic compartment of antigen-presenting cells. it has been shown that the human cd8+ t cells recognized epitopes of a 28-kd hemolysin  from hla*0201+ persons with latent tuberculosis infection  <cit> . hence, the best role that can be visualized for the rv <dig> would be limited to destabilizing the phagosomal compartments for which we have shown the evidence in figure 6c. for this activity, it is essential that the rv <dig> must be present at or beneath the surface of mycobacterial cell envelope. upon contact/entry with the host macrophage or a phagosomal compartment, it can attach to the membrane for destabilization. the contact dependent hemolysis observed by us can indirectly suggest this possibility.

in addition to the haemolytic activity of rv <dig>  our preparations have shown an unambiguous ribosomal rna methyltransferase activity as well. expression of rv <dig> had resulted in susceptibility to capreomycin . all these observations together summarily suggest that the rv <dig> is dually active protein.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have been successful in providing clear answers to the questions mentioned earlier viz.  the rv <dig> can be present in two distinct locations viz. intracellularly to methylate the ribosomal rna which confers susceptibility to capreomycin and also at the cell membrane to destabilize the target membranes upon its contact.  based on the oligomeric bands and the dissociation of the oligomers under reducing, boiling conditions confirm that the rv <dig> might not be assisted by any other protein  the orchestration of hemolysis by this protein involves a possible burial of its amino terminus in the target membranes upon its contact while its carboxy terminus can anchor with the host bacterial cell wall. to the best of our knowledge, a dual activity has not been demonstrated either for cytolysins or for rna methyltransferases using highly purified preparations of proteins. further studies are underway to know the role of this protein in the context of bacterial growth and survival to know the functions of rv <dig>
