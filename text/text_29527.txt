BACKGROUND
aquilaria sinensis is a tropical evergreen tree widely distributed in fujian, guangdong, guangxi and hainan provinces in china and the other countries such as vietnam, india, indonesia, malaysia, and thailand  <cit> . under stress conditions such as infected by fungi or wounded by wind, lighting, and bited by insects, resin-impregnated heartwoods are slowly forming in the trunk and branches of a. sinensis . those resinous heartwoods are commercially called agarwood which has been long-term used as an anti-emetic, digestive, and sedative agent in traditional medicines, and also as incense and peculiar perfume  <cit> . however, the production of agarwood always takes decades in natural processes, and the natural aquilaria forests have been seriously destroyed in all countries because of the high value and great demand of agarwood. therefore, a. sinensis has been listed in appendix ii of the convention on internal trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora  <cit> . under these circumstances, aquilaria trees were cultivated for production of pharmaceutically important and commercially valuble agarwood using artificial methods such as burn-chisel-drill, trunk pruning, and fungi inoculation  <cit> . however, production of agarwood using artificial methods still takes long time, and the products are always with low quality.

previous investigations revealed that 2-chromones are the principal components of argarwood . there are more than  <dig> congeners of 2-chromones have been reported  <cit> , and many of 2-chromones have potentially pharmacological activities including neuroprotective activity, cytotoxic activity, antibacterial activity, ache inhibitory, anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidatic activity . however, the biosynthesis and regulation of 2-chromones remains completely unknown.

agarwood-producing plants are timber species which take a considerably long time to grow and the resinous portion is formed inside of the wood. it makes studies using fresh plants difficult and inconvenient. thus, establishing calli and cell suspension cultures of a. sinensis with high production of 2-chromones, the principal components of agarwood, would be undoubtedly useful for the studies on the mechanism of agarwood formation  <cit> . it has been reported that salicylic acid and the crude extracts of fungi could elicit the production of 2-chromones in the calli and cell suspension cultures of a. sinensis  <cit> . we are, recently, focusing on exploring the mechanism of agarwood formation, establishment of effective method which can be used to induce the production of 2-chromones in calli and cell suspension is therefore critically important. surprisingly, we firstly found that salinity stress induced the production of structurally diverse 2-chromones in a. sinensis calli and suspension cells, suggesting that 2-chromones might be responsible to salt stress responses. identification of these 2-chromones produced in salt-treated calli and suspension cells would be useful for further research on the biological functions of 2-chromones in stress responses and the mechanism of agarwood formation.

on the other hand, plants integrate complex signal pathways that may cross-talk and diverge at various steps in response to salt stress  <cit> . high salinity stress induces the biosynthesis of hormones to regulate the expression of specific genes and metabolites including the most important stress-responsive hormone abscisic acid   <cit> . salinity stress causes water deficit and osmotic stress, enriching the production of aba in shoots and roots  <cit> . the accumulation of aba can alleviate the inhibitory influence of salinity stress on photosynthesis and growth  <cit> . some other phytohormones such as salicylic acid  and brassinosteroids , also participate in plant responses to abiotic stress  <cit> . cross-talk among ca2+ signaling pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades in salt stress responses have been recently been reported . moreover, novel classes of transcription factor family members viral for signal transduction are induced by salt tress, including bzip, wrky, ap2/erf and nac families which facilitate the expression levels of various genes that eventually influence plant tolerance of salt stresses . previous research indicated that the transcriptional expression of bzip genes were enriched in salt-sensitive wheat variety under salt stress, but decreased in salt-tolerant cultivar  <cit> . in arabidopsis, salt stress induced the expression of at wrky <dig> which directly binds with the promoter of rd29a  <cit> . ap2/erf family members of rice play a significant role in salinity stress response  <cit> . over expression of a nac transcription factor family member in rice and wheat confers salt tolerance  <cit> . although traditional forward and genetic approaches can provide valuable insights to salt stress responses, technical limitations may prevent further research. genome-wide transcriptome analyses have dramatically improved the efficiency of salt stress-related gene discovery  <cit> . in arabidopsis, more than 20 % of the transcriptome was observed regulating under salinity stress using transcriptome analysis  <cit> . however, no systematic consensus on the specific classes of genes corresponding to particular signaling events in response to salt stress has been established so far. identification and characterization of the key factors for salt stress-response signaling pathways will be meaningful for further understanding the mechanism of stress responses and the biosynthesis of specific secondary metabolites.

herein, nacl was demonstrated to be an ideal elicitor to induce the production of 2-chromones in a. sinensis calli. using lc-ms-it-tof,  <dig> phenylethylchromones were identified from nacl-treated a. sinensis calli. in order to elucidate the possible mechanisms of salt stress responses of a. sinensis, transcriptome sequencing was performed using illumina sequencing technology, and the data was analyzed to identify the differentially and specifically expressed transcripts of salt-regulated genes. concurrently, the novel classes of nacl-responsive genes relevant to signal transduction in response to salt stress were characterized. the results provided valuable insights for further studies on the mechanism of salt stress signaling transduction and agarwood formation.

RESULTS
salt stress induced the production of 2-chromones in a.sinensis calli
to study the effects of different nacl concentration on the biosynthesis of 2-chromones, 75 mm, 150 mm and 300 mm nacl was applied to the media and 2-chromones were measured by lc-ms-it-tof system at 10 days . the peaks of tentative 2-chromones in the bpc profiles of calli extracts indicated that the most species and contents of 2-chromones were induced by 150 mm nacl . no 2-chromones were produced in the control calli  . our experiments indicated that the accumulation of 2-chromones kept constantly increasing until four weeks in nacl-treated calli. therefore, extracts of a.sinensis calli treated with 150 mm nacl for 4 weeks were analyzed by lcms-it-tof. the bpc profiles of a.sinensis calli extracts and mixed standards comprising  <dig> known 2-chromones isolated from agarwood are shown in fig. 1c and d. forty one 2-chromones were putatively identified on the basis of their uv and ms data, and  <dig> of them were unambiguously identified by comparing their retention time  on hplc chromatogram, uv and ms data with those of authentic compounds. the other  <dig> compounds were tentatively identified by their predicted molecular formulas deduced from their hresims data, and further confirmed by comparison of their ms/ms data with those of in literature  <cit> . all the data of 2-chromones identified from nacl-treated a. sinensis calli are summarized in table  <dig>  including rt, molecular formula, calculated and experimental molecular weight , error  in generated molecular formula, and ms/ms data. the structures of  <dig> unambiguously identified 2-chromones from nacl-treated a.sinensis calli are represented in fig.  <dig>  previous studies showed that crude extracts of melanotus flavolives  sing. only induced four 2-chromones in a.sinensis cell suspension cultures  <cit> . in this study, we firstly used the salt treatment which is the most important abiotic stress to produce a lot of 2-chromones. these results indicated that salt stress was the effective method to induce the production of 2-chromones in calli.fig  <dig> analysis of 2-chromones from nacl-treated a. sinensis calli by lc-dad-it-tof-ms system. a calli treated with different consistence of nacl at 10dpi. b effects of treatment with different consistence of nacl on the production of 2-chromones. c bpcs of salt-treated aquilaria calli extracts. d bpcs of mixed 2- chromone standards isolated from agarwood. bpcs: 50–1000 m/z

optimization of illumina sequencing timing
previous experiments indicated that the cell were almost died at 10 days, in order to determine the best time for tanscriptome analysis, cell activity and 2-chromone accumulation in calli treated with 150 mm nacl was investigated at 0 h, 24 h,72 h, 120 h, 168 h and 216 h. the results revealed that the activities of the cells treated with nacl decreased significantly at 24 h and 120 h, and the activities reached to 30 % and 5 % of the control, respectively . we also discovered that the main 2-chromones detected from the calli were  <dig> -dimethoxy-2- chromone  and  <dig> -dimethoxy-2- chromone  during the early inducing period . these two compounds are also the main 2-chromones in agarwood and kept increasing in the wood tissues of a. sinensis with the time of fungal infection  <cit> . therefore, the occurrence of these two 2-chromones could be used as an important indicator for studies on the formation of agarwood. compound  <dig> was firstly detected in the nacl-treated calli for 24 h , and then the contents of compounds  <dig> and  <dig> increased constantly. the production of 2-chromones  <dig> and  <dig> increased remarkably at 120 h , continuously, high-quality and sufficient rna could be isolated from the calli which were treated with 150 mm nacl until 120 h. therefore, three cdna libraries from the control and induced a.sinensis calli treated with salt at 24 h and 120 h were constructed using illumina sequencing.fig.  <dig> effects of nacl treatment on the cell activity of a. sinensis calli and production of 2-chromones at different time points. a relative cell activity of calli exposed to 150 mm nacl treatment. values was means standard error . means denoted by the same letter did not significantly differ at p < <dig>  according to duncan’s multiple range tests. b bpcs of 150 mm nacl treated a. sinensis calli extracts at 0 h, 24 h and 120 h



transcriptome sequence assembly and annotation of the unigenes
three cdna libraries which were generated with mrna from control calli, and calli induced by 150 mm nacl at 24 h and 120 h were assembled and annotated. a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> clean reads for control  and induced calli which treated with 150 mm nacl for 24 h  and 120 h  were generated after removal of the adaptors and unknown or low-quality reads, giving a total of  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 160 nt,  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 980 nt and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> 420 nt for the control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h library . after complete assembly of the reads,  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> contigs with median contig size of 476 nt, 466 nt and 474 nt, were yielded from the control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h library, respectively. further assembly analysis showed that the control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h library consisted of  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig> unigenes , respectively. however, there were  <dig>  <dig> unigenes with a mean length of 1562 nt were generated from three libraries. the length distribution of unigenes was shown in the additional file 1: table s <dig> table  <dig> summary statistics for sequencing and sequence assembly for three libraries prepared from the control and salt-treated calli



functions of the unigenes were annotated by blastx based on sequence similarity to sequences in the public databases, including nr, swiss-prot, kegg, cog and go database, and then aligned to the nucleotide database nt  by blastn. there were  <dig>  <dig> unigenes matched to one or more database and a total of  <dig> unigenes were annotated. nr classification results revealed that there were  <dig> unigenes matched to this database and the unigenes of a.sinensis shared  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % similarity to the homologs with vitis vinifera and ricinus communis by blastx annotation, followed  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % for populus balsamifera and amygdalus persica, respectively . to further classify the function of the total unigenes, the unigenes were annotated by the go, cog and kegg database. go analysis indicated that the unigenes were grouped into three main categories , which together include  <dig> function classes .  <dig> unigenes had cog annotations and were distributed in  <dig> clusters including the largest group “general function prediction”, followed by the group of “replication, recombination and repair” and “transcription” . gene annotation and pathway mapping in kegg database indicated that  <dig> unigenes were distributed in  <dig> kegg pathways. the top three kegg pathways which include the largest number of unigenes were metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and plant-pathogen interaction .fig.  <dig> species distribution of unigenes by blastx annotation. the figure indicated species distribution of unigenes blastx annotation with a cut-off e-value of  <dig> e <dig>  different color showed different species



with the advent of sequencing, genome-wide analyses become available in many plant species and have significantly improved the efficiency of gene discovery. however, no genomic data is available for a.sinensis. the illumina technology have been the first choice in field of transcriptome sequencing studies since  <dig>  owing to the increasing in sequencing length of reads to 150 bp or more  <cit> . in this study, we carried out de novo transcriptome assembly of a.sinensis calli. to date, the transcriptome information of a.sinensis was acquired by roche  <dig> gs platform  <cit> . however, our de novo transcriptome analysis generated greater depth of sequencing, obtaining more complete coverage of the transcriptome comparing with  <dig> pyrosequencing in previous study. in this study, our transcriptome assembly was compared with the previous published transcriptomes using  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . as shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  more than 57 % unigenes were greater than 1 kb, and more than 73 % unigenes were greater than 500 bp. however, over 70 % of the unigenes assembled by  <dig> gs platform were 200 bp and 600 bp long. these results indicated that our seq-rna assembly captured larger portion of the transcriptome of a.sinensis. owing to lack of genomic resources for a.sinensis, the proportions of unigenes which significantly corresponding to the known proteins in genbank were considered as another useful metric. nearly  <dig>  % of our unigenes had matched in nr protein database, and this value was higher than  <dig>  % reported in  <dig> gs platform assembly  <cit> . thus, the de novo assembly of mrna-seq will significantly improve the genome annotation of a.sinensis and be used for further study on the functional members of gene families.

functional analysis of differentially expressed genes
to investigate the gene expression changes in response to salinity stress, the gene expression level was measured in fragment per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped  and the false discovery rate  <  <dig>  and the absolute value of log <dig> ratio ≥  <dig> was used as a threshold to estimate the statistical significance of transcript expression. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified, including  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> expressed uniquely in control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h libraries, respectively;  <dig>  <dig> unigenes were expressed in three libraries but at different levels . after induced by salt treatment for 24 h,  <dig> genes were induced while  <dig> genes were down-regulated. however,  <dig> genes were up-regulated and  <dig> genes were down-regulated after induced by salt stress for 120 h .fig.  <dig> comparison of the unigenes expressed in the salt-treated and control labraries. a venn diagram showing the unigenes expressed in the control and salt-treated calli. b changes in gene expression profiles among the control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h calli libraries. the number of up-regulated and down-regulated degs between the control and induced-24 h, control and induced-120 h libraries were shown. we judged the significance of gene expression difference with the threshold fdr ≤  <dig>  and the absolute value of log2ratio ≥ 1



the differentially expressed genes from the control and induced libraries were organized in functional categories by go enrichment analysis . according to the sequence homologies, the differentially expressed genes were assigned to three principal categories: biological process, cellular component and molecular function, which contained  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> functional groups. among these groups, the induced-24 h vs control and induced-120 h vs control comparisons had similar distribution of gene functions in biological process, cellular component and molecular function. however, the go terms “cell periphery”, “extracellular region” and “external encapsulating structure” were significantly enriched after inducing by salt stress for 24 h, whereas “cell periphery”, “anchored to membrane” and “regulation of meristem growth” were primarily enriched after inducing by salt stress for 120 h . we also found that a high percentage of transcripts after inducing by salt for 24 h and 120 h fell into the functional groups: “cell”, “cell part”, “cellular process”, “metabolic process” and “organelle part”. to further analysis the function of differentially expressed transcripts, the differentially expressed genes were mapped in the kegg database. the kegg analysis indicated that  <dig> degs with pathway annotation were distributed in  <dig> kegg pathways after salt treatment for 24 h, and among these pathways,  <dig> pathways with p-value ≤  <dig>  were significantly influenced . after inducing 120 h by 150 mm nacl,  <dig> annotated degs transport involved in  <dig> kegg pathways, and  <dig> pathways with p-value ≤  <dig>  were significantly enriched . notably, remarkable enrichment was observed in plant-pathogen interaction pathway, stilbenoid, diarylheptanoid and gingerol biosynthesis pathway, plant hormone signal transduction pathway and pheylpropanoid biosynthesis after inducing by salt for 24 h and 120 h . these results suggested that the transcriptome of a.sinensis calli was remarkably affected in response to salinity stress and provided resources for screening genes required for salinity stress and agarwood formation.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes in salt-treated calli relative to control calli. the functions of degs covered three principal categories : biological process, cellular component and molecular function



confirmation of differentially expressed candidate transcripts by quantitative real-time pcr 
to confirm the reliability of the rna-seq results, a total of  <dig> candidate genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis with specific primers . the analysis results suggested that all  <dig> degs selected had the same expression trends as illumia-solexa sequencing . for example, both qrt-pcr and rna-seq analysis indicated that the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase , calmodulin, wrky transcription factors , caffeoyl-coa-o-methyltransferase, and chalcone synthase  <dig> were significantly more highly expressed in salt-treated calli compared with the control calli. otherwise, suppression of auxin influx carrier and auxin response factor  <dig> by salt treatment indicated by rna-seq analysis was verified by qrt-pcr analysis. furthermore, a high correlation  was detected between rna-seq and qrt-pcr . these results demonstrated the changes in the gene expression analyzed by rna-seq reflecting the practical transcriptome difference between the control and salt-treatment calli.fig.  <dig> validation of the relative expression levels of differential expression transcripts by quantitative rt-pcr  analysis. a expression profiles of the selected degs in the salt-treated calli relative to the control calli, as determined by qrt-pcr and rna-seq. the x-axis indicated the annotation of the selected degs. the y-axis indicated the normalized expression level of the genes. a: calmodulin 1; b:calcium-binding protein cml37; c: calcium-dependent protein kinase 10; d: calcium-dependent protein kinase 13-like; e: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase a; f: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2; g: mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2; h: auxin influx carrier; i: auxin response factor 4; j: g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase; k: cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase 25; l: lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase fls2; m: wrky transcription factor 75; n: wrky transcription factor 40; o:wrky transcription factor 29; p: ethylene-responsive transcription factor erf; q: myb-related protein myb4; r: myb superfamily protein 1; s: methyltransferase pmt15; t: caffoyl-coa-o-methyltransferase; u: caffeic acid 3-o-methyltransferase; v: chalcone synthase; w: respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein a; x:respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein b; y: respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein d; z: pathogenesis-related protein sth- <dig>  the transcriptional level of the selected genes was performed by qrt-pcr with three biological replications and action was used as an internal reference. error barsrepresent the standard deviations of qrt-pcr signals . b correlation of the expression ratio of selected degs analyzed by qrt-pcr and rna-seq



salinity stress induced a complex hormone signal pathway

high salinity elicits rapid and constantly changes in gene expression overlapping with responses to the hormone  <cit> . abscisic acid is an essential hormone that mediates plant growth in response to salinity stress through regulating the expression of many genes which encode various proteins vital for biochemical and physiological processes. aba mediates the salt-stress signaling transduction pathway through the important signaling components, including the aba receptor pyr/pyl family proteins, the group of protein phosphate 2c, the members of serine/threonine –protein kinase snrk <dig>  and aba responsive element binding proteins  <cit> . in a.sinensis calli during salinity stress, the proteins of aba receptor pyr/pyl family, phosphate 2c family and aba responsive element binding proteins family showed significantly differential expression patterns, however, the transcripts which annotated as serine/threonine-protein kinase snrk <dig> showed no obvious changes. the comparative analysis of expression profiles indicated a crosstalk between salt stress and aba signal pathway. as well as the well-known stress-responsive aba, other phytohormones were also responsible for salt stress. recent studies indicated that alterations in cytokinine signaling influenced plant response to abiotic stress, seed germination, cell division, and floral initiation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, endogenous cytokinin overproduction decreased salt stress resistance, however, low cytokinin levels promoted salt-induced senescence in tomato  <cit> . our transcriptome analysis indicated that the majority of receptor kinases and response regulators responsible for cytokinine signal transduction were significantly decreased under salt treatment . for example, the majority of changed a.sinensis cre <dig> genes which are the important cytokinin receptors were down-regulated under salt stress. down-stream genes such as arr-b genes indicated both up- or down-regulated under salt stress at different time point. plants utilized auxin signaling to modify root development when responding to diverse biotic and abiotic signals including salinity stress  <cit> . in arabidopsis, salt stress inhibits the pin <dig>  expression which is known to dominate gravitropic root response by monitoring bicipital auxin transport  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes required for the auxin signal pathway were differentially expressed under salt treatment in calli. the majority of changed aquilaria auxin influx carrier and auxin response factor genes were down-regulated under salt stress conditions in calli, however, the genes annotated as auxin-responsive protein , auxin responsive gh <dig> gene family and saur family protein were both up- and down- regulated during salt treatment . in addition, many aquilaria brassinoteroid signal transduction genes, such as brassinoteroid resistant1/ <dig> and brassinoteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinases  family of genes, were also differently expressed under salt stress. in particular, the brassinoteroid resistant1/ <dig> family genes were down-regulated during salt treatment, however, the bak <dig> family members which acting on serine/threonine containing substrate and required for brassinosteroid signal transduction  <cit> , were both up- and down-regulated during salt stress in calli at different time point . furthermore, families of jasmonate zim domain-containing protein , transcription factor myc <dig> and tga which involved in jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signal transduction  <cit> , respectively, were also different expressed under salt stress in calli, with majority up-regulated. besides aba, cytokinine, auxin, brassinoteroid, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signal pathways in response to salinity stress, other hormones including ethylene and gibberellin also play an important role for salt stress signaling transduction. the comparative analysis of expression profiles indicated that salinity stress induced complex hormone signal pathways.

salt stress regulated the genes associated with signal transduction: receptor-like kinases, ca2+ -binding proteins and mapk proteins
an appropriate defense response to salt stress initially requires recognition of the stress. one of the largest groups of receptor proteins related to the responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses is the receptor-like kinase superfamily which possesses an amino-terminal signal sequence, a transmembrane segment and intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain . we identified  <dig> degs annotated as receptor-like kinases induced in the calli under salinity stress . a total of  <dig> degs identified at 24 h in calli after induced by salt stress were annotated as receptor-like kinases, while a total of  <dig> degs categorized as receptor-like kinases were induced by salt treatment at 120 h. among these degs,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated induced by salt treatment after 24 h, whereas,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated at 120 h after induced by salt, however, with  <dig> degs co-regulated in 24 h and 120 h after induced by salt. hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes annotated as receptor-like kinases suggested overall difference at control, 24 h and 120 h in the calli induced by salinity stress .

at least four receptor-like kinase families have been reported to be induced in stress-responsive genes: lrr receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase , proline-rich receptor-like kinase , cysteine-rich receptor-like protein kinase , and g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase . lrr-rlk family constitutes the largest group among the receptor-like kinases, and regulates various plant processes of plant growth and development underlying the abiotic stress and biotic stress response . for instance, fls <dig> which is the member of lrr-rlk, recognizes the bacterial flagellin fragment and mediates defense responses in plants  <cit> . brassinosteroid insensitive 1-associated receptor kinase  which is a member of lrr-rlk and is responsible for br hormones, regulate plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . consistent with these, we observed that a total of  <dig> differential expressed transcripts were annotated as lrr-rlk family members, including  <dig> of fls <dig> subgroup members and  <dig> of bri subgroup members . for instance, a fls <dig> subfamily member, were induced more than 4-fold by nacl at 24 h and 120 h in calli, and we confirmed this by qrt-pcr. perk family members act as sensors/receptors in cell wall and monitor changes to the cell wall during plant exposure to abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . the first characterized perk member was brassica napus perk <dig>  which expressed in different tissues and rapidly induced by wounding  <cit> . another member of perk family, perk <dig>  was a positive regulator in aba and salt stress reponses. we observed that  <dig> of transcripts for perk family members detected were regulated in response to nacl treatment and about half of transcripts were up-regulated. however, we observed the majority of the crr-rlk and srk family members were up-regulated under salt stress in different time point, as expected for these two families of stress-inducible receptor-like kinases. many of other nacl-responsive receptor-like kinases shown in the table are potentially regulators of the nacl-stress response in a.thaliana. these results suggested that the transcription of the majority of receptor-like genes is controlled and modulated by salt stress, implying their important roles in salt stresses signaling transduction. the downstream events of receptor-like kinase signaling relate to protein phosphorylation via a mitogen-activated protein kinase  cascade  <cit> . in our analysis, salt stress influenced the expression pattern of several mitogen-activated protein kinase genes. a total of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts involved in mapk pathways and up-regulated transcripts were especially predominant in the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family . for instance, three mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinases that encoded mapkkka, mapkkk <dig> and mapkkk <dig> were transcriptionally enriched  at 24 h and 120 h under salt treatment , and we conformed this by qrt-pcr. however, most members of mitogen activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase genes including the protein encode mpk <dig> and mekk <dig> in a.thaliana that play an important role for stresses response were down-regulated at two time point <cit>  . calcium ions  have been demonstrated as a second messenger in plant signaling pathways including response to salt stress. it has been reported that salt treatment trigger a transient increase in ca2+ level  <cit> . the activation of mapk through stresses is always dependent on binding of ca2+-binding proteins including calmodulins , calcium-binding protein, calcium-dependent protein kinases  and calcineurin b-like protein  . in our analysis,  <dig> differentially expressed unigenes which annotated as ca2+ dependent proteins were responsive to salt stress signal transduction and up-regulated transcripts were especially predominant in cml proteins at 24 h and 120 h under salt stress. aquilaria calli genes encoding ca2+ dependent proteins including cam <dig>  cml <dig>  cml <dig>  cml <dig> and cdpk <dig> which are responsible for plant innate immunity  , showed a high expression, suggesting these proteins might be a component of ca2+ signaling to modulate plant defense response against salt stress. thus, receptor-like kinases, mapk cascades and ca2+ dependent proteins involved in salt stress signal transduction.table  <dig> expression patterns of unigenes annotated as members of mapk cascades and ca2+ signal pathways

transcription factors are essential for regulation of gene expression, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and signal transduction. the arabidopsis genome possesses at least  <dig> predicted transcription factors that have been classified into  <dig> families. however, there were  <dig> predicted transcription factors were regulated by salt treatment. in a.sinensis, a total of  <dig> degs were annotated as transcription factors.  <dig> degs were induced by 150 mm nacl at 24 h, with  <dig> degs were up-regulated and  <dig> degs were down-regulated, whereas  <dig> degs were induced by nacl at 120 h,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated, however, only  <dig> degs were co-regulated at 24 h and 120 h . hierarchical clustering of degs annotated as transcription factors suggested overall difference in control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h libraries . at least seven transcription factor families have been reported to be enriched in stress-responsive genes: ap2/erf, myb, wrky, bhlh, hox, nac, and hsf . ap2/erf is one of the largest transcription factor family involved in the response to salt stress, which can be further classified into four subfamilies: erf, dreb, ap <dig>  rav  <cit> . of these, erfs and ap2s expression levels were found to be correlated with salt tolerance and activate the downstream salt-responsive genes. in a.sinensis, we observed  <dig> of ap2/erf family transcripts were regulated by salt stress , and the up-regulated transcripts were detected in three ap2/erf family’s subgroups at two time point . however, the erf subfamily members were found to be significantly induced by salt stress at 24 h and 120 h in a.sinensis calli . recent analysis of the myb family members expression level concluded that most of myb-transcription factor are responsible for stresses and hormones  <cit> . consistent with this analysis, in arabidopsis, at least one third of the  <dig> predicted myb transcription factors were enriched by nacl at the transcript abundance level, and in wheat  <dig> of  <dig> detectable myb family members were induced by high salt at transcript level  <cit> . similarly, we observed that a total of  <dig> degs were annotated as myb family members and  <dig> of  <dig> co-regulated transcripts were enriched by nacl . myb <dig> and myb <dig>  were induced more than 4-fold by nacl at each of two time point , and we confirmed this by qrt-pcr. in addition, the other myb family members such as myb <dig>  myb <dig>  myb <dig> and myb <dig> were up-regulated by nacl. the majority of wrky family members which contain zinc-finger motifs are known to involve in biotic and abiotic response  <cit> . in arabidopsis, more than 1/ <dig> wrky transcription factors were induced by nacl, and the members of wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> were significantly enriched  <cit> . we observed that  <dig> degs were annotated as wrky family transcription factors and the majority of the wrky family members were up-regulated by salt treatment at 24 h and 120 h . we also used qrt-pcr to confirm these observations for wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> , which were significantly enriched by salt stress. three other large families of transcription factors with distinct dna binding motifs are bhlh, hox and nac genes  <cit> . all of these families contained nacl-responsive genes, however, the members of hox and nac families were remarkably enriched in nacl-induced transcripts. furthermore, most of the hsf family members were enriched by salt stress  <cit>  , as expected for this family of stress-responsive transcription factors. many other transcription families including myc, gras, tga, tcp and gata , contained nacl-responsive genes and played important role for the physiological response to nacl treatment. the large number of up- or down-regulated transcription factor genes we observed, is consistent with the existence of a complex signal transduction network underlying the response to salt stress.table  <dig> transcription factors co-up-regulated by salt stress at different time in a.sinensis calli



putative genes involved in biosynthesis of 2-chromones in calli under salinity stress
our study showed that salinity stress induced the production of 2-chromones in a.sinensis calli. these results suggested that the activities of enzymes which are responsible for biosynthesis of 2-chromones were enriched by salinity stress. the rna-seq analysis indicated that the diarylheptanoid and ginerol biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched, however, curcumin synthase which is a plant polyketide synthase and is the most important synthase for diarylheptanoid and ginerol biosynthesis  <cit> , could not be annotated the three libraries including control, induced-24 h and induced-120 h. according to the structure of 2-chromones, we proposed that the biosynthesis of 2-chromones might be similar to diarylheptanoids, and polyketide synthases  except curcumin synthase may play a vital role in the biosynthesis of 2-chromones  <cit> . the transcriptome data indicated that the expression of chalcone synthase which is a member of type iii polyketide synthase was affected after induced by salt for 24 h and 120 h . among these genes, the chalcone synthase  <dig>  was up-regulated in calli after induced for 24 h and 120 h; however, the expression of chs <dig> was reduced at 120 h . the phylogenetic tree was constructed according to the pkss amino acid sequences by neighbor-joining method using mega  <dig>  software to investigate the evolutionary relationship and distribution among pkss from different species. the phylogenetic tree analysis allow the classification of pkss in higher plants in two different clusters called chsand non-chs  cluster, and aschs <dig> was grouped in non-chs cluster, including curcuminoid synthase  from monocots oriza sativa, diketide-coa synthase  and curcumin synthase  from monocots curcuma longa, and aschs <dig> was grouped in chs cluster  <cit>  . these results suggested that aschs <dig> might possess an unusual catalytic potential and could be the important enzyme for biosynthesis of 2-chromones. 2-chromones always display o-methyl groups on the phenylethylchromone scaffold. it suggested that o-methyltransferase plays a critical role in transferring o-methyl groups to 2-chromone scaffolds. recently, transcriptome analysis result from the medical plant glaucium flavum indicated that the o-methyltransferase  were required for benzylisoquinoline alkaloid  biosynthesis  <cit> . transcriptome resource analysis of aquilaria calli revealed the biosynthesis of 2-chromones required the members of flavonol 3-o-methyltransferase and caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase families transfer o-methyl groups to the 2-chromones scaffolds . rna-seq analysis showed that a total of  <dig> degs were annotated as flavonol 3-o-methyltransferase and a total of  <dig> degs were annotated as caffeoyl-coa o-methyltransferase . more than half of transcripts annotated as o-methyltransferase were enriched by salinity stress at 24 h and 120 h. these results demonstrated that chalcone synthase and o-methyltransferase play a critical role in biosynthesis of 2-chromones.table  <dig> expression patterns of genes involved in biosynthesis of 2-chromones

CONCLUSIONS
we firstly identified  <dig> 2-chromones from the salt-treated a.sinensis calli by lc-ms system. to find the transcripts responsible salinity stress, a comprehensive transcriptome analysis was conducted from the control calli and induced calli with 150 mm nacl treatment. a total of  <dig>  <dig> unigenes with an average length of 1562 nt were obtained, and they were annotated by comparing them with the public database including nr, swiss-prot, kegg, cog and go database. our transcriptional analysis revealed numerous genes that were differentially expressed at 24 h and 120 h under salt stress in calli. the differentially expressed candidate genes from rna-seq were confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis. we found that numerous genes involved in hormone signal transduction, mapk cascades signal transduction, ca2+ signal transduction, or encoding receptor-like kinase and transcription factors showed different expressions between the control and salt-treated calli. these differences suggested that a complex signal pathway were induced in response to salinity stress. in addition, our rna-seq analysis observed that chalcone synthase and o-methyltransferase may regulate the biosynthesis of 2-chromones. these results provide a better understanding of salt stresses signal transduction in a.sinensis calli, and clues to facilitate the mechanism of agarwood formation.
