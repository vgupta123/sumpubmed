BACKGROUND
there are more than one million species of insects in the world. insects can adapt to any number of environmental conditions because of their small size. studies of insects have contributed a wealth of scientific discoveries. the i5k project, which began in  <dig>  <cit> , aims to sequence the genomes of  <dig> arthropod species. this project provides genomic information for minor insect species, such as those not used experimentally .

researchers can now access public databases containing the genomic information of many insects for comparative analyses  <cit> . for our present study, we easily obtained gene sequences and analyses from large datasets, including rna-seq results, from public databases. however, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of gene annotations in non-model organisms. thus, we need to develop an analysis procedure for how to select functional genes from public databases.

enolase is a key glycolytic enzyme . glycolysis is responsible for the majority of energy production in all organisms. in a human study, three enolase isoenzymes were identified as homodimers composed of two alpha , 172430), two gamma , or two beta  subunits. isoenzyme alpha is present in most tissues, whereas the beta form is localized to the muscle and the gamma form is found only in nervous tissue  <cit> . a sperm-specific enolase was also identified in mus musculus  <cit> . the eno <dig> and eno  <dig> sequences are well conserved in vertebrates, whereas the insect enolase 1-like sequence is well conserved across arthropods.

in recent years, many insect enolases have been discovered. insect enolases differ from mammalian enolases in that they have relatively low conservation among insects and show species-specific functions. for example, the enolase of the parasitic wasp, aphidius ervi is expressed on the egg surface and contributes to the digestion of host proteins by promoting plasmin generation as a plasminogen receptor  <cit> . the expression of an enolase protein was up-regulated in the midgut of aedes aegypti infected with chikungunya or dengue viruses  <cit> . these reports suggest that insect enolases can have many different species-specific roles. to analyze the function of an enolase, the gene sequence of the organism of interest is required.

the silkworm bombyx mori is a lepidopteran insect that has been used as a model insect in agricultural research for several reasons: 1) the majority of agricultural pests are lepidopterans, 2) its genome sequence is almost completely characterized, 3) various spontaneous genetic mutants are available, and 4) the silkworm is amenable to transgenic, knock-out, and microarray technologies . however, there have been very few reports about enolase in lepidopteran insects.

in this study, we used a combination of dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolase genes in b. mori using public databases. we found two genes and one isoform of b. mori functional enolases and characterized their functions.

RESULTS
five enolase candidates were identified from b. mori datasets
first, we searched for enolase candidate sequences in a translated database of b. mori ensembl genes  and kaikobase cdnas  using the hmm search pipeline with two hmm profiles  and enolase c-terminal domain ) retrieved from the pfam protein family database . five sequences were revealed to encode enolases within the b. mori genome . these sequences were annotated as enolases and were located at the following positions: bmeno <dig> and bmenox were on chr <dig>  11726013– <dig> , bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were on chr <dig>  9181393– <dig> , and bmenoy was not mapped on the b. mori chromosomes. the bmeno <dig> sequence was found in only the b. mori ensembl gene dataset, and the bmenoc sequence was found only in the kaikobase cdna dataset. the deduced open reading frame  of bmeno <dig> and bmenox was  <dig> nucleotides long, encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acids, a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and a putative isoelectric point  of  <dig> . the deduced orf of bmeno <dig> was  <dig> nucleotides long, and encoded a protein with  <dig> amino acids, a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and a putative pi of  <dig> . the deduced orf of bmenoc was  <dig> nucleotides long, encoding a protein with  <dig> amino acids, a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and a putative pi of  <dig> . bmenoc was similar to the c-terminus of the bmeno <dig> sequence. the deduced orf of bmenoy was  <dig> nucleotides long, and encoded a protein with  <dig> amino acids, a molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, and a putative pi of  <dig> .fig.  <dig> combining dry and wet bench processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm b. mori. to identify enolase sequences in b. mori, we performed a hmm search of public databases. we found five enolase sequences, which we then characterized using rna-seq analysis, cdna cloning, and rt-pcr. finally, we determined that three enolase genes in b. mori were functional. the insect experimental tools and machines drawings  are licensed at

therefore, we identified five putative enolase sequences from the b. mori gene datasets from ensembl metazoa and kaikobase.

analysis of b. mori enolase sequences
alignment with enolase homologs from other species showed that the deduced bmeno amino acid sequences, except for bmeno <dig> and bmenoc, contained all of the conserved ser, glu, and asp residues . these amino acid residues are involved in the coordination of the metal-binding domain. the bmeno <dig> and bmenoc sequences contained a conserved asn residue that replaced the asp residue as the metal-binding amino acid residue . in fig.  <dig>  amino acid residues  related to enolase active sites, also known as substrate binding pockets, are shown with asterisks. these amino acid residues were changed to ser, arg, and asp in bmeno <dig> and bmenoc .

the bmenox amino acid sequence corresponded well with the bmeno <dig> amino acid sequence except for an unknown amino acid at residue  <dig> . furthermore, the bmenoc amino acid sequence from position  <dig> to  <dig> corresponded well with the bmeno <dig> amino acid sequence at positions  <dig> to  <dig> . however, the n-terminus of bmenoc was slightly different from that of bmeno <dig>  the entire amino acid sequence of bmenoy corresponded with that of h. sapiens eno <dig>  .

three enolases have been identified in vertebrates, including mammals. in the phylogenetic tree that contains amino acid sequences of the bmenos and enlases of the species shown in table  <dig>  the five identified bmenos were distributed into three clusters . bmeno <dig> and bmenox were located in the same cluster close to each other. bmenoy was distributed in the cluster that contained h. sapiens enolase . interestingly, bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were distributed in an independent cluster that contained only lepidopteran insect sequences .fig.  <dig> a phylogenetic tree of b. mori enolases and enolase proteins of other species. the amino acid sequences of the bmenos were aligned with enolases of the species shown in table  <dig>  bmenos are framed in red





cdna cloning of bmenos from b. mori larvae and verification with rna-seq analysis
next, we cloned the bmeno cdnas from b. mori larvae, and verified these sequences in the testis using rna-seq analysis. from the cdna cloning, we identified three bmenos in the b. mori kinshu × showa strain: bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc. we verified the expression of the bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc mrnas using rna-seq analysis at single-nucleotide resolution . the expression levels of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were similar, and the expression of the c-terminus was significantly increased in bmeno <dig> compared with the n-terminus . this comparison would not have been available without rna-seq analysis. the nucleotide sequences of bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc were submitted to ddbj/ena .fig.  <dig> verification of enolase mrna expression by rna-seq analysis. histograms show the frequency of bmeno <dig>  and bmeno <dig>  gene expression. the boxes below indicate exon positions. the black arrows in b show regions similar to those of the bmenoc sequence

the distribution of the bmeno mrnas in different tissues during different developmental stages is shown in fig.  <dig>  the bmeno <dig> mrna was expressed in all tissues beginning on day  <dig> of the fifth instar period and continued through all developmental stages. the bmeno <dig> mrna was mainly localized to the testis, but also showed weak expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. the bmeno <dig> mrna was detected in the whole bodies of day  <dig> pupae. the bmenoc mrna was detected only in the testis. bmenoy was not detected in any tissue at any developmental stage . however, the bmenoy mrna was detected in the human cell line hepg <dig> derived cdna library .fig.  <dig> tissue and developmental stage distribution of bmeno expression. a tissue-specific expression of the bmenos. lane  <dig>  brain;  <dig>  nerve ganglion;  <dig>  suboesophageal ganglion;  <dig>  silk gland;  <dig>  midgut;  <dig>  malpighian tubule;  <dig>  fat body;  <dig>  testis; and  <dig>  ovary. each sample was derived from a day  <dig> fifth-instar larva. b developmental stage-specific expression of the bmenos. lanes 1– <dig>  whole body, day  <dig> first to fifth instar larvae;  <dig>  whole body, day  <dig> pupa;  <dig>  whole body, day  <dig> adult. c expression of the bmenos and hsgapdh in cdna from hepg <dig> cells




we investigated the bmeno <dig> and bmeno <dig> mrna distribution in the testis from day  <dig> of the fifth instar larval stage to the adult stage by quantitative rt-pcr . the bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc mrnas showed different expression patterns in the testis from day  <dig> fifth instar larvae to adults.fig.  <dig> quantitative rt-pcr confirmation of bmeno <dig> and bmeno <dig> mrna expression in the testis. bmeno <dig> is marked with black circles, bmeno <dig> is marked with white circles, and the combination of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc is marked with white triangles. the mrna expression of each enolase is shown as rq values in days  <dig> to  <dig> of the fifth-instar larval stage , days  <dig> to  <dig> of the pupal stage , and day  <dig> of the adult stage  . the rq value on day  <dig> of the fifth instar larva was set to  <dig> . error bars indicate the relative minimum/maximum expression levels against mean rq expression levels. technical replications were performed in triplicate




confirmation of bmeno isoforms
to verify the bmeno isoforms, a northern blot analysis was conducted using specific probes. these probes were labeled with dig from position  <dig> to  <dig> in the bmeno <dig> nucleotide sequence and from position  <dig> to  <dig> in the bmeno <dig> and bmenoc nucleotide sequences. the bmeno <dig> probe showed a  <dig> % match with positions  <dig> to  <dig> of the bmenoc sequence. the transcription products were detected as single bands with characteristic sizes:  <dig> bases for bmeno <dig>  and  <dig> bases for bmeno <dig> and bmenoc . bmenoc may be an isoform of bmeno2; however, we could not detect a variation in size between bmeno <dig> and bmenoc with northern blotting .fig.  <dig> northern blot analysis of bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc. total rna  isolated from the testis of day  <dig> fifth-instar b. mori larvae was analyzed by northern blot analysis using probes that labeled bmeno <dig> and both bmeno <dig> and bmenoc. bands of approximately  <dig> bases were identified as the bmeno <dig>  and bmeno <dig>  transcripts. a bmenoc band was not detected. total rna was loaded for bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  bmenoc, and 18s rrna 




discussion
in this study, we obtained candidate bmeno sequences from public databases. using a combination of dry and wet processes, we identified functional enolases in b. mori. these enolase amino acid sequences were composed of two domains. the n-terminus consisted of a shorter enolase_n motif, and the c-terminus consisted of a longer enolase_c motif. bmenoc did not contain the enolase_n motif.

the his  <dig>  glu  <dig>  glu  <dig>  lys  <dig>  his  <dig>  and lys  <dig> amino acid residues are required for s. cerevisiae enolase activity. amino acid residues ser  <dig>  asp  <dig>  glu  <dig>  and asp  <dig> were identified as critical for metal-binding in s. cerevisiae enolase . bmeno <dig> also contained these active residues  and metal-binding residues . however, bmeno <dig> and bmenoc had different amino residues from bmeno <dig> at the metal-binding and substrate-binding sites . the chinese oak moth  is a lepidopteran insect, and its enolasei and enolaseii genes corresponded well with bmeno <dig> and bmeno <dig>  a. pernyi enolaseii contains the same metal-binding and substrate-binding amino acid residues as bmeno <dig> and bmenoc  <cit> . our phylogenetic analysis showed that bmeno <dig> was close to the cluster containing insect enolases, such as those from d. melanogaster, t. castaneum and a. mellifera. bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were located in a lepidopteran-specific cluster. sequences that belong to this cluster have residues that differ from the conserved residues necessary for enolase activity . thus, lepidopteran-specific enolases may have glycolytic enzyme activity that does not require the aforementioned conserved enolase residues.

cdna cloning showed that the bmeno <dig> amino acid sequence corresponded with that of bmenox. we also confirmed that the chromosome positions of bmeno <dig> and bmenox were identical. as a result, only one transcript was detected as bmeno <dig>  these results suggest that the bmenox sequence was misread and incorrectly registered in the public database.

the chromosome positions of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were also nearly identical. however, the bmenoc sequence differed from that of bmeno <dig> by three amino acid residues. cdna cloning and rna-seq analysis showed bmenoc is likely an isoform of bmeno <dig>  rt-pcr analysis showed that the bmeno <dig> mrna was mainly expressed in the testis, followed by the suboesophageal ganglion, and also a little bit in the ovary. bmenoc was only expressed in the testis. to examine the physiological functions of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc in the testis, we performed qrt-pcr on testis from day  <dig> fifth-instar larvae to adults. bmeno <dig> and bmenoc were highly expressed from day  <dig> of the fifth-instar larval stage to the prepupal stage. when spermiogenesis occurs from the end of larval developmental stage to the prepupal developmental stage, the testis becomes hypertrophied in b. mori  <cit> . the ecdysone titer is increased in b. mori at this time  <cit> . thus, the expression of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc may correlate with spermiogenesis in b. mori.

almost all lepidopteran insects have two kinds of sperm: apyrene and eupyrene sperm  <cit> . both sperm types are essential for fertilization in lepidopteran insects, but the role of this evolutionarily-conserved system in fertilization remains unclear. furthermore, a sperm-specific enolase was reported to control sperm formation and mobility in m. musculus  <cit> .

in this study, we found differences in the mrna expression of bmeno <dig> and bmenoc. the bmeno <dig> mrna was expressed in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide  is secreted from the suboesophageal ganglion in b. mori, and affects the pheromone glands of female moths and stimulates the biosynthesis of a sex pheromone . diapause hormone  is also secreted from the suboesophageal ganglion and promotes embryonic diapause . dh also stimulates the prothoracic gland and promotes ecdysteroid generation, which controls molting and metamorphosis  <cit> . future studies should examine the function of bmeno <dig> outside of reproduction. based on these data, bmenoc might be an isoform of bmeno <dig> that has a different function.

bmenoy mrna expression was not detected by rt-pcr in any b. mori tissue at any developmental stage. however, the bmenoy mrna was expressed in the human cell line hepg <dig>  sequence analysis of bmenoy showed that its amino acid sequence completely matched that of h. sapiens alpha enolase. thus, bmenoy might be a result of contamination by human alpha enolase that was incorrectly registered in the public database. in conclusion, our results suggest bmeno <dig>  bmeno <dig>  and bmenoc are functional enolases in b. mori.

in this study, we performed a pipeline analysis using a combination of dry and wet bench processes. using a molecular biological approach, we identified functional enolases in b. mori. bmeno <dig> was conserved across species. however, bmeno <dig> and bmenoc appear to have a lepidopteran-specific function rather than a glycolytic enzyme function. notably, enolase functions as a dimer. therefore, research on how the enolases characterized in this study combine and function is needed. future studies should compare the expression and enzymatic activities of the dimer proteins in different tissues and developmental stages. the key bmeno <dig> amino acid residues partially differed from those in bmeno <dig>  and may play an important role in enzyme activity and metal binding.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified three b. mori enolases using a combination of dry and wet bench processes. these bmenos have different functions within the tissues of b. mori. at some point, incomplete transcripts or uncorrected data were registered in public databases. if we can resolve these database errors using wet bench processes, then the usefulness of public databases will increase for all users. all public databases provide a wealth of information for future scientific research. thus, we proposed a procedure for how to identify active genes from public databases in this study. it is important that public databases are regularly maintained by users. our combination of dry and wet experiments is useful for the detection of minor genes and declared functional genes of non-model organisms in public databases.
