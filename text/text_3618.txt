BACKGROUND
voltage-gated calcium  channels couple membrane depolarisation to the entry of ca2+ that, in turn, is fundamental in a variety of cellular events such as contraction  <cit> , changes in gene expression  <cit>  and neurotransmitter release  <cit> . cav channels belong to the super-family of voltage-gated ion channels that also include sodium channels and potassium channels  <cit> , and can be broadly classified into high-voltage activated  and low-voltage activated  classes. hva cav channels are heteromeric protein complexes composed of a pore-forming α <dig> subunit and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits  <cit> . in addition to promoting surface expression of the cavα <dig> subunit, cavβ subunits modulate the kinetics of activation and inactivation, gating  <cit>  and the rate of recovery from inactivation  <cit> .

schistosomes are parasitic trematode flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting approximately  <dig> million people worldwide. with the ultimate goal of understanding the molecular basis for neuromuscular transmission in these parasitic flatworms, we have previously cloned three transcripts from schistosoma mansoni that code for one l-type-like and two non l-type high voltage-activated cav channel α <dig> subunits  <cit> . heterologous expression of these α <dig> subunits in xenopus oocytes and mammalian cell lines has proved problematic, perhaps because of the relatively high a-t content of these coding regions, or the lack of a specific chaperone in these systems. additionally, we have identified two cav channel β subunits from schistosomes and other platyhelminths: a conventional β subunit , and a variant β subunit , which appears to be unique to platyhelminths and has unusual structural and functional features  <cit> .

when heterologously expressed in xenopus oocytes, the conventional schistosome cavβ subunit significantly increases cav <dig>  current amplitude, and shifts the steady state inactivation curve to more hyperpolarized potentials  <cit>  . the actions of this β subunit are consistent with those of mammalian cavβ subunits  <cit> . here, we have reproduced and extended our previous data on modulation of cav <dig>  currents by the schistosome smcavβ subunit  in a mammalian cell system, which may better approximate the cellular milieu in which these channels are found in situ. xenopus oocytes are widely used in expression of ion channels and other proteins, in part because they are primed for high levels of protein translation. however, most other cells are not that strongly geared towards this role. oocytes are much larger than adult, differentiated cells and contain high amounts of yolk granules. in addition, the mammalian cell line hek does not express the endogenous cavβ subunit that complicates analysis of heterologously expressed cav channels in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . finally, adult s. mansoni live in a mammalian host environment.

interestingly, during these studies, we observed a rapid run-down of the currents produced by cav <dig>  channels co-expressed with this schistosome cavβ subunit. decrease of ca2+ channel activity under whole-cell patch-clamp, a configuration of the patch-clamp technique that disrupts the contact between membrane and cytoplasm, is a well-known phenomenon  <cit> . however, very few studies have dealt with the structural and biochemical causes for run-down, and those studies focus primarily on l-type ca2+ channels. notably, kameyama and collaborators were able to relate run-down of l-type ca2+ channels to the ca2+-binding protein calmodulin  <cit> . here we investigate the mechanism of this β subunit-dependent rundown, examining the role of several forms of atp and cations in run-down of the cav <dig> /smcavβ complex. additionally, we use a truncated β subunit protein to provide clues regarding the molecular substrate within the smcavβ subunit that mediates run-down of cav <dig> /smcavβ currents.

RESULTS
smcavβ modulates activation and inactivation of cav <dig>  in a conventional manner
to assess the modulatory phenotype of cavβ subunits, a hek- <dig> cell line stably expressing the human cav <dig> d subunit  was used. using ca2+ as the charge carrier, currents produced by cav <dig>  alone peaked at + <dig> mv with an average amplitude of - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . co-expression of smcavβ increased peak amplitudes to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa  and shifted the i–v peak leftwards, to + <dig> mv .

data represent mean ± s.e.m. number of repeats is indicated in parentheses. asterisks indicate statistically significant difference .

using ca2+ as the charge carrier, the decaying phase of cav <dig>  currents produced by cav <dig>  channels alone or with smcavβ subunits was well fitted by a double exponential function with fast  and slow  time constants of inactivation . the double exponential fit to the decay of currents produced by cav <dig>  in response to a pulse to + <dig> mv had a fast time constant of  <dig> ms that contributed 66% to total current decay, and a slow time constant of  <dig> ms that represented 34% of total current decay. the double exponential fit to the decay of currents produced by cav <dig>  co-expressed with smcavβ in response to a depolarizing pulse to + <dig> mv had a fast time constant of  <dig> ms, which contributed 55% to total current decay, and a slow time constant of  <dig> ms that contributed 45% to total inactivation. fundamentally, smcavβ slowed macroscopic inactivation of cav <dig>  currents by increasing the time constants of both the fast and slow components while simultaneously decreasing the contribution of the fast component and increasing the contribution of the slow component to total inactivation . co-expression of smcavβ markedly shifted the midpoint of steady-state inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction . midpoints of single order boltzmann fits to steady-state inactivation curves of cav <dig>  and cav <dig>  + smcavβ currents were, respectively, - <dig> mv and - <dig> mv . the slope factors of these boltzmann fits to steady-state inactivation were not significantly different:  <dig> mv/e-fold for cav <dig>  and  <dig> mv/e-fold for cav <dig>  + smcavβ .

smcavβ significantly slowed the rate of recovery from inactivation. the fractional recoveries of current as a function of time at - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> mv were well fitted by a single exponential function with recovery time constants from inactivation . for example, τrec for cav <dig>  and cav <dig>  + smcavβ from - <dig> mv were, respectively,  <dig> and  <dig> ms  .

the mammalian  β2a subunit  increased current amplitude to a similar extent as the schistosome cavβ subunit, shifted the steady-state inactivation curve in the hyperpolarizing direction, although to a lesser degree than the schistosome cavβ subunit, slowed macroscopic inactivation, and shifted the i–v peak in the hyperpolarizing direction .

cav <dig>  currents run-down in the presence of smcavβ in a manner independent of ca2+ but dependent on chelated forms of atp and free na+
currents produced by cav <dig>  progressively decrease in amplitude to approximately 75% of their initial values within ~ <dig>  minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration, but only when smcavβ is co-expressed . over the same time frame, no run-down was observed for currents produced by cav <dig>  expressed alone, nor in the presence of the mammalian cavβ2a subunit nor with the structurally atypical schistosome smcavβvar subunit . substitution of cacl <dig> by an equimolar concentration of bacl <dig> did not prevent run-down, indicating that this phenomenon is ca2+ independent .

we hypothesized that this rapid run-down could be caused by physical dissociation between smcavβ and cav <dig> . however, as the kinetics of inactivation and the steady state inactivation properties were identical before and after run-down , it seems likely that the association between cav <dig>  and smcavβ remained intact in these conditions.

since mg2+ is known to block ca2+ channels from the intracellular side, we replaced mg2+-atp with an equimolar concentration  of na+2-atp, yet under these conditions we still observed significant run-down that, again, was dependent upon co-expression of the schistosome cavβ subunit . no run-down was observed in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments using a "minimal" internal solution without atp . further experiments indicate that non-chelated forms of atp  do not mediate smcavβ-dependent cav <dig>  run-down . currents produced by cav <dig> /cavβ2a did not run-down in the presence of  <dig> mm intracellular nacl, na2-atp, tris2·atp or in minimal intracellular solution .

next we explored the possibility that this particular form of run-down was caused by the cations associated with the atp molecule . free mg2+ reduced currents produced by cav <dig>  alone by about 75%, and by about 90% when smcavβ was co-expressed ; therefore, since it would be very challenging to distinguish ca2+ current decrease due to run-down from ca2+ current decrease due to blockade by internal mg2+, we did not pursue run-down studies in the presence of free mg2+. however, in contrast with mg2+, free na+ did not suppress the activity of cav <dig>  channels expressed alone or co-expressed with the schistosome smcavβ or with the mammalian cavβ2a subunit . however, substituting mg2+-atp with nacl resulted in significant run-down , indicating na+-dependent modulation of channels containing smcavβ.

the structural basis for run-down mediated by smcavβ resides in its acidic n-terminal domain
the n-terminus of the smcavβ subunit contains an atypical domain that is rich in glutamic acid and aspartic acid residues . since blast screens for similar domains in other proteins did not yield any hits, we set to investigate whether this n-terminal domain represents the structural base for the atypical modulation of the smcavβ subunit. furthermore, there is precedence for important modulatory effects on cav channels localizing to the n-terminal regions of β subunits  <cit> . to this end, we created a truncated version of smcavβ that lacks the first forty-six amino acids containing this acid-rich domain , and tested whether it still caused cav <dig>  currents to run-down. the n-terminally truncated smcavβ subunit enhanced cav <dig>  currents, slowed their macroscopic inactivation and shifted their steady-state inactivation to the same extent as the wild type smcavβ subunit . however, unlike the wild-type version of smcavβ, the n-terminally truncated smcavβ subunit did not induce run-down of ca2+ currents within 2– <dig> minutes of establishing the whole-cell configuration with an internal solution containing either  <dig> mm mg2+-atp , or  <dig> mm nacl .

discussion
in this study we set out to characterize the modulatory phenotype of a cavβ subunit from the parasitic trematode s. mansoni. this β subunit is phylogenetically close to other cavβ subunits  <cit> . the mammalian hek- <dig> cell line was used as the expression system and the mammalian cav <dig>  channel splice variant "d" as our "test" α <dig> subunit. this splice variant is susceptible to modulation by cavβ subunits  <cit>  and is the longest of all known versions of the cav <dig>  subunit  <cit> . our data show that smcavβ exhibits similar modulatory phenotypes in hek cells and xenopus oocytes. additionally, smcavβ slows recovery from inactivation of cav <dig>  currents using ba2+ as the charge carrier, i.e. in the absence of intracellular ca2+ accumulation. using strontium as the charge carrier, mammalian and jellyfish cavβ subunits also slow recovery from inactivation of this same channel in conditions in which ca2+ does not accumulate in the intracellular compartment  <cit> . however, it is important to note that recovery from inactivation appears to depend heavily on the identity of the cavα <dig> subunit being assayed: all jellyfish and mammalian cavβ subunits delayed recovery from inactivation of cav <dig>  channels, but accelerated the recovery of the jellyfish l-type cav channel  <cit> .

smcavβ-dependent run-down of cav <dig>  currents
while characterizing the modulatory phenotype of smcavβ, we consistently observed a rapid run-down of cav <dig>  currents only in the presence of smcavβ. this contrasts with previous studies, in which run-down appears to occur in the α <dig> subunit, independently of accessory subunits  <cit> . down-regulation of ca2+ currents caused by interaction of cavβ subunits with intracellular proteins is well documented. for example, interaction of cavβ subunits with small gtpases of the rgk family  <cit> , with large gtpases of the dynamin family  <cit> , or with the nuclear protein hp <dig>  <cit>  results in down-regulation of ca2+ currents. our data represent the first case, to our knowledge, of down-regulation of ca2+ currents by interactions between cavβ subunits and chelated forms of atp or na+ ions, which are likely relevant to platyhelminth physiology. unlike previous studies, in which hydrolysable forms of atp suppress ca2+ current run-down  <cit> , here we show that two physiologically relevant, hydrolysable forms of atp induce smcavβ-mediated decrease in cav <dig>  activity. the possibility that run-down was caused by mg2+ ions that dissociate from the atp molecule was considered, but the fact that free mg2+ dramatically suppressed cav <dig>  currents posed a significant challenge to explore this possibility. these results are reminiscent of the effects of mg2+ ions at a similar concentration on l-type cav channels, which occurs by their binding to a low-affinity site at the pore of the α  <dig> subunit  <cit> . since atp associates with na+ ions under physiological conditions  <cit> , we also measured run-down of cav <dig> /smcavβ channels in the presence of intracellular na+2-atp. because we detected significant run-down under these conditions, and knowing that the binding constant between na+ ions and atp is relatively low, about  <dig> m- <dig> , we hypothesized that na+ ions that had dissociated from atp were causing this run-down. experiments using nacl instead of na+2-atp confirmed this hypothesis.

our study is not the first to show cavβ-dependent run-down of non-l type ca2+ current. the mammalian cavβ subunit appears to enhance run-down of the non-l-type, cav <dig>  α <dig> subunit  <cit> . however, it is important to note that in that study, run-down occurred under the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration on xenopus oocytes, where the connection between cytoplasm and plasma membrane remains largely intact. therefore the mechanism of run-down employed by the mammalian cavβ subunit is likely to be distinct from that used by the schistosome cavβ subunit.

molecular substrate for smcavβ-dependent mg2+-atp and na+ sensitivity
since the conventional smcavβ subunit contains a string of acidic residues in the n-terminal domain that is not found in its mammalian counterparts, we generated a version of this subunit that lacked this region, to test whether this unique domain is the molecular substrate for this particular form of run-down. deletion of this acidic, n-terminal fragment did not change the modulatory phenotype of smcavβ on current amplitude, inactivation kinetics or steady-state inactivation. however, in contrast to our results with wild type smcavβ, cav <dig>  currents did not run down when co-expressed with this mutated subunit, using ca2+ as the charge carrier and in the presence of intracellular free na+ or mg2+-atp. it seems likely that sensitivity to intracellular mg2+-atp and free na+ resides in all or part of the string of acidic residues of the smcavβ subunit.

physiological relevance
several reports have shown that the ca2+ currents of platyhelminth muscle and nerve cells are very labile, running down within minutes or even seconds after establishing the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration. in previous work, the intracellular solution used to record voltage-gated ca2+ currents from muscle cells of s. mansoni was titrated with naoh to bring the ph to a physiological value  <cit> . we have empirically calculated that this action would bring the concentration of na+ to approximately  <dig> mm, which is sufficient to reduce ca2+ currents modulated by smcavβ significantly, according to our data. similarly, ca2+ currents recorded from isolated muscle cells of the free-living flatworm bdelloura candida run-down within  <dig> seconds of establishing the whole-cell configuration  <cit> : it is tempting to speculate that this run-down was caused by the relatively high concentration of nacl  added to the intracellular solution in these experiments.

our previous studies have identified a different schistosome cavβ subunit , which does not exhibit the hallmark action of cavβ subunits, namely, to increase ca2+ current density. together with the data presented here, this raises the question of whether schistosomes employ unique strategies to modulate excitability via atypical modulation of hva cav channels, information that could be useful in the design of targeted therapies to treat schistosomiasis.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified novel functions for a schistosome cavβ subunit, namely to confer ca2+ currents with sensitivity to intracellular mg2+-atp and na+ ions, which translates into a reduced ability on the part of this cavβ subunit to increase ca2+ currents. we conclude that the molecular basis for this atypical sensitivity to both mg2+-atp and na+ ions resides in a domain or domains located within the first forty-six amino acids of smcavβ, which contains a string of twenty-two aspartic and glutamic acid residues not present in other cavβ subunits.
