BACKGROUND
throughout the world, cassava  has been cultivated as an important food source and industrial feedstock since agriculture was developed. accordingly, it ranked fourth among all crops in worldwide production. thailand was the world's leading exporter  <cit> . as a cyanogenic crop, cassava has the ability to release hydrogen cyanide  during cell damage  <cit> . variation among cultivars in their cyanogenic potential , causes concerns about their possible health effects such as acute intoxication, manifested as vomiting, dizziness, etc.  <cit>  and environmental toxicity  <cit> . improved cassava cultivars with low cn and an improved understanding of genes affecting cn were of considerable interest.

cn was reported to be a quantitative trait  <cit> . since conventional breeding was not effective or efficient with quantitative trait loci  of moderate to low heritability, molecular breeding was expected to be an efficient, reliable and cost effective breeding approach  <cit> . for molecular breeding, qtl analysis was often used to identify trait-linked markers in order to facilitate marker-assisted selection . qtl identification was not only used to assist breeding program, but also to gain understanding of the loci and underlying genes and their effects  <cit> .

in the present study, an f <dig> outbred population was chosen for qtl analysis because that population structure required the least time to generate. the population provided the significant segregation of both genotype and phenotype as required for qtl discovery  <cit> . a large number of ssr markers for cassava have been developed  <cit> . these markers were used to construct a genetic linkage map in order to apply for identification of qtl underlying cn trait.

RESULTS
phenotypic measurement
variation in the cn in an outbred population derived from 'hanatee' × 'huay bong 60' and its parents are shown in table  <dig>  in all evaluated years and locations, the cn of 'hanatee' was approximately two folds lower than 'huay bong 60'.

the distribution of the cn in the population showed continuous variation, across a wide range , typical of quantitative traits. that implied that cn would be underlain by polygenes. transgressive variation was observed that may have resulted from cooperation or interaction among the loci and genes present in the two parental types. in addition, over-dominance and epitasis may also have contributed to the transgressive segregation  <cit> . the correlation coefficients  among years and locations ranked from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and showed significance at p <  <dig>  . therefore, the phenotypic data were appropriate for qtl analysis but mean data might be less informative than individual environments.

linkage map construction
a total of  <dig>  available ssrs consisting of  <dig> primer pairs provided from the international center for tropical agriculture   <cit> ,  <dig> primer pairs from  <dig> primer pairs from sraphet et al.   <cit>  and kunkeaw et al.   <cit>  were tested for informative markers between the parental lines. of these,  <dig> markers  were informative and successfully genotyped within the population. from genotypic data using  <dig> loci, the results showed that  <dig> markers  had distorted segregation ratios. eleven markers  were 100% identical to other marker loci. therefore, those  <dig> total dna markers were excluded. the highly distorted segregation ratios found in this study were common among out-crossing species like cassava  <cit> 

the linkage map  consisted of  <dig> markers located on  <dig> linkage groups. the map covered  <dig>  cm with average spacing between markers of  <dig>  cm, smaller than the  <dig> cm desirable for qtl detection by interval mapping   <cit> . although the derived map had good potential to identify qtl, it was not yet a saturated map. more markers or inclusion of markers with distorted segregation ratios maybe required, to bring the number of linkage groups equal to the number of haploid genome .

the cassava genome database contained a draft sequence in late  <dig>  <cit> , in which there were  <dig>  scaffolds spanning  <dig> mb. the ssr loci used in the map were identified in the scaffolds. a total of  <dig> scaffolds were placed on the map. of these,  <dig> scaffolds containing more than one marker locus from the same linkage group. however,  <dig> of  <dig> scaffolds were separated by markers from other scaffolds. for example, on the lg <dig>  there were  <dig> loci which can be located on  <dig> scaffolds of the cassava genome sequences . within the region between eme <dig> to ca <dig>  scaffold <dig> was separated by scaffold <dig>  the lack of correspondence of some marker orders in our genetic map with the physical order in the sequence of cassava may have resulted from inaccurate estimations of genetic distance based on recombination frequency. errors might be found in both genetic maps and preliminary scaffold assemblies. alternately, the difference in genetic background of the cassava used in the two studies may underlie the differences.

qtl discovery
based on multiple-qtl models  analysis, only  <dig> qtl were detected across  <dig> linkage groups, 1- <dig> from each environment . each qtl showed lod scores that were higher than the chromosome wide significant threshold. the lod scores of the qtl identified ranged from  <dig> - <dig> . the qtl with the largest effect had a lod score higher than both chromosome and genome wide significant thresholds. cn09r <dig> was located on linkage group  <dig> associated with marker locus ca <dig>  in addition, cn09r <dig> also explained the largest portion of variation at  <dig>

the lod scores of some qtl were lower than genome wide significant threshold as expected for sparse maps   <cit> . however, for all qtl, the phenotype means indicated that one allele combination was markedly better at each location although the differences were not all significant. therefore, many qtl were dependent on the environment. equally, the large variation in cn found among environments showed a strong environmental effect . the percentage of phenotypic variation explained  from all detected qtl ranged from  <dig> - <dig> % .

although mqm showed the highest precision to identify and map qtl, kruskal-willis  analysis was used for single marker analysis to avoid type  <dig> errors. except for cn08r <dig>  all identified qtl showed significance by kw analyses . even though cn08r <dig> did not show significance by kw analysis, loci flanking this qtl showed strong significance. that suggested that all loci detected were the real qtl not type  <dig> errors  <cit> . no common qtl was found across all environments , which may be because the cn was highly sensitive to environment  <cit> . however, kw analysis of cn09r <dig> showed significant association with cn across all environments.

in a previous study by kizito et al.   <cit>  two qtl for cn were found linked to loci ssry <dig> and ssry <dig>  the locus ssry <dig> was not polymorphic in the current map, but ssry <dig> was found on linkage group  <dig> as was cn09l <dig>  however, ssry <dig> was  <dig>  cm far from the position of cn09l <dig>  it should be kept in mind that qtl analysis is based on statistical analysis and there is a strong environmental effect on cn  <cit> . therefore, individual qtl may not be found only in specific populations or environments. however, this study helped develop markers to assist in cassava improvement, and for the study of genes affecting to cn and for comparative mapping in other related species.

in addition, functional gene annotation of the regions within 2-lod support of each qtl was performed. a total of  <dig> annotated genes, consisting of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> predicted genes underlying the regions of cn08r <dig>  cn09r <dig>  cn09r <dig>  cn09l <dig> and cn09l <dig>  respectively were identified . interestingly, three annotated genes at the qtl peaks have been predicted including; a nucleotide-binding protein of  <dig> kda , β- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase  and an adenosine/guanosine diphosphatase  within intervals that contained qtl cn09r <dig>  cn09l <dig> and cn09l <dig>  respectively . nbp <dig> belongs to subgroup of the p loop ntpases which perform a wide variety of cellular functions such as signal transduction, signal-sequence recognition, protein transport and localization, chromosome partitioning, etc.  <cit> . nbp <dig> was an iron-sulfur protein with a dual localization in the cytosol and nucleus. it played a direct role in biogenesis and was essential for eukaryotic metal ion insertion in proteins and membrane transport  <cit> .

adenosine/guanosine diphosphatases were nucleoside diphosphatase acting on hydrolysis of phosphoric ester. one of the substrates for this enzyme was nucleoside diphosphate which is generated by glycosyltransferase in the fungal, plant, and mammalian cell secretory pathways  <cit> . the conversion of nucleoside diphosphate by nucleoside diphosphatase yields monophosphates which relieve inhibition of the transfer enzymes and provide substrates for antiport transport systems by which the entrance of nucleotide sugars from the cytosol into the secretory pathway lumen was mediated. however, the absence of diphosphatase activity does not end glycosylation or the entrance of nucleotide sugars into lumen  <cit> .

β- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase belongs to the glycosyltransferase family of enzymes. they act to catalyze the transfer of a sugar  unit from a sugar nucleotide derivative to a sugar or amino acid acceptor   <cit> . cyanogenic glycosides are precursors of hcn in cyanogenesis pathway  <cit> . to produce linamarin and lotaustralin, which are cyanogenic glycosides in cassava, the glcosyltransferase must catalyze l-valine and l-isoleucine  <cit> , and thus the gene encoding this β- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase might be involved in this process.

there is no report to link nbp <dig> and adenosine/guanosine diphosphatase directly to the cyanogenesis pathway, however these two enzymes were involved in common biogenesis. in addition, sequences of linamarase  and hydroxynitrile lyase  which are key enzymes involved in the cyanogenesis pathway were found on scaffold <dig> and scaffold <dig>  respectively. however, these scaffolds were not anchored by any of the markers in this study linkage map. thus, it would be useful to identify additional markers to link these enzymes to the map.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, an ssr based genetic linkage map of cassava was constructed using an f <dig> population of a cross between 'hanatee' and 'huay bong 60'. the map was used for analysis of qtl underlying cn, and five potential qtl were detected. among all the qtl, cn09r <dig>  which was located on linkage group  <dig> was the strongest with the lod value of  <dig>  and it explained  <dig> % of the variation in cn. in addition, all loci on the genetic map were compared with the data from cassava genome sequence. the anchor markers common to both could help the organizing and completion of chromosome sized scaffolds. the loci found in this study will be useful for identification of genes controlling the traits as well as establishing mas of cassava in the future.
