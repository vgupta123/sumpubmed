BACKGROUND
in biological systems, cellular communication is mediated by various types of molecules, including signaling proteins. however, some inorganic ions, such as na+, k+, and ca2+, are known to be involved in important signaling processes, especially in tissues and organs that are composed of electrically excitable cells. the role of ions as signaling molecules is possible partially because their distribution and trafficking in cells, tissues and organs are tightly regulated by membranous structures. among these signaling ions, calcium ions  are known to contribute to numerous cellular processes in both excitable and non-excitable cells during development and differentiation  <cit> . for example, in the central nervous system, glial ca2+ signals play important roles in various physiological processes, including cellular proliferation and the coordination of neuronal metabolism  <cit> . developmental and physiological roles of ca2+ waves have also been well documented in the retina  <cit> , the skeletal muscles  <cit> , and the intact liver  <cit> . spontaneous ca2+ waves coordinate morphogenesis in zebrafish  <cit> , and long-distance cellular communication through intercellular ca2+ waves has also been reported in the slime mold  <cit> . in insects, ca2+ waves have been well studied in the blowfly salivary gland  <cit> ; however, the developmental roles of ca2+ waves in insect tissues have not been elucidated  <cit> . we therefore examined these processes using pupal wing tissues of butterflies.

butterfly wings harbor unique color patterns that are constructed by regularly arranged scales on the surface of the wing, akin to mosaic roof tiles. at the microscopic level, each scale has a single color that is produced by a single epithelial scale cell during the pupal stage  <cit> . at the macroscopic level, the color pattern of a wing is the result of a collection of color pattern elements  <cit> . the diverse color patterns of butterflies are due to a transformation of the nymphalid groundplan  <cit> , which is a simple scheme of the manner by which color pattern elements are positioned against a plain background. one representative color pattern element is an eyespot . the center of the prospective eyespot area functions as an organizing center from which a putative morphogenic signal that determines color patterns is believed to be released to the surrounding tissue  <cit> . many putative genes that may be involved in this process are expressed in the prospective eyespot area  <cit> , yet their functions remain elusive.

although the nature of the morphogenic signals is not known, the color pattern determination process has been explained using a concentration gradient model for positional information  <cit> . this model has been applied to an ideally symmetric eyespot in the model butterfly bicyclus anynana  <cit> , but the actual eyespot structures of nymphalid butterflies are too diverse in shape to be explained by a simple gradient model  <cit> . furthermore, damage-induced color pattern changes in junonia almana, which have been examined at relatively high resolution, are not explainable by a simple concentration gradient model  <cit> . such damage experiments have demonstrated that the inner and outer black rings of a single eyespot respond to damage independently, that damage near an eyespot can change the shape and size of a nearby eyespot, that damage can induce an orange background region inside of a black ring, and that when one eyespot is reduced in size due to damage, an adjacent eyespot increases in size  <cit> . considering the diverse eyespots widely observed in nymphalid butterflies and the results of the damage experiments, an induction model has been proposed, in which morphogenic signals are not static concentration gradients but are instead generated as serial pulses or waves from an organizing center  <cit> .

over the course of butterfly evolution, repeated wing-wide systematic changes in the position, size, and shape of color pattern elements in the nymphalid groundplan may have occurred. similar global changes in these elements can be induced by temperature shock or chemical injection  <cit> , demonstrating that the fate of differentiating immature scale cells can be modified by environmental factors. it has been proposed that wing-wide signals, such as ecdysteroids and cold-shock hormones , coordinate the overall color patterns of wings  <cit> . a global signal is also implicated by the positional dependence of scale size and shape  <cit> . although this global signal may not be identical to morphogenic signals from organizing centers, we hypothesized that a long-range signal that travels across the wing plays an important role in the development of scales and epithelial scale cells and hence the color patterns of butterfly wings. we speculated that ca2+ waves are the most likely to be involved in the mechanism underlying this function.

in this study, we investigated the potential involvement of ca2+ waves in butterfly wing development using the blue pansy butterfly junonia orithya, which has large eyespots on its wings . we have previously established a system that enables us to directly observe developing wing tissues in vivo until eclosion without any detectable disturbing effects and to load chemicals into the developing wing  <cit>  . using this system, we have characterized the manner by which pupal wing tissue develops over time in vivo  <cit> . because this method is very simple and non-invasive, only involving wing displacement, the possibility of introducing artifacts is minimal .figure  <dig>

in the present study, we discovered ca2+ waves in the developing wing tissues in vivo. our results suggest that spontaneous and damage-associated ca2+ waves that propagate slowly over long distances may play roles in the development and differentiation of pupal epithelial scale cells.

RESULTS
spontaneous long-distance ca2+ waves across a wing
to observe calcium dynamics in an intact pupal hindwing, we used fluo-4 am or fluo-8 am, which are commonly used ca2+ indicators. the indicators were successfully loaded into the wing tissues after surgery . we first focused on the m <dig> and cua <dig> compartments, here called the border region of the pupal wing tissue. the cua <dig> compartment  contained the prospective eyespot area. however, the prospective eyespot area was resistant to the indicators , as described previously  <cit> . this resistance was most likely because of the thick cuticle and dented structure of the eyespot area  <cit> .

in the non-eyespot areas of the m <dig> and cua <dig> compartments, we observed many spontaneous intercellular ca2+ waves  that traveled slowly over long distances  . several ca2+ waves were observed simultaneously in various locations within a single visual field. when the ca2+ waves were physically close to each other, they appeared to collide, reducing in velocity and amplitude. we detected periodic fluctuations in fluorescence intensity in defined regions of interest  at approximately 5–10 min intervals .

the positional origins of many of the ca2+ waves were too diffuse to identify, which is partially because several waves crossed the visual field simultaneously and because our visual field was not large enough to pinpoint the origins of these waves. however, some ca2+ waves appeared to propagate from the immediate periphery of the prospective eyespot in the  <dig> individuals examined . although the prospective eyespot itself did not stain well as mentioned above, radially expanding rings that were observed from the immediate periphery of the prospective eyespot suggest that the organizing center may be able to emit ca2+ waves.

similarly, we next focused on the compartments near the prospective discal spot, here called the basal region of the pupal wing tissue. we detected several ca2+ waves that appeared to originate from the basal compartments close to the prospective discal spot at intervals of approximately 5–10 min  . it is worth noting that the discal spot is likely the organizing center of the central symmetry system  <cit> . we noticed that different individuals exhibited different wave patterns from similar locations . interestingly, complex wave behavior, including spiral or vortex movement, was observed in  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals examined .

traveling distance and velocity of ca2+ waves
to determine the manner by which the waves travel long distances, we evaluated a representative case from the basal area at which a ca2+ wave crossed a visual field diagonally from the upper right side to the lower left side over a period of 5 min . we set  <dig> rois containing a few cells in the direction of wave propagation at regular intervals . the ca2+ wave appeared to decrease in intensity as it traveled .figure  <dig>

another ca2+ wave traveling diagonally from the lower right side to the upper left side in a visual field was also captured at the cellular level . rod-like subcellular structures , and to a lesser extent, their surroundings, were lit sequentially, a few cells at a time . the velocities of the ca2+ waves appeared to decrease as they propagated, but their intensities varied in different cells .

we examined the relationship between the travel distance of a wave and its velocity . the velocities of the ca2+ waves were 1–10 μm/sec, and the maximum traveling distance was approximately 1 mm. a reasonable correlation value of r =  <dig>   was obtained. the waves that traveled long distances were faster than those that traveled short distances. the propagation of these ca2+ waves could be described as negative acceleration with a varied initial velocity.

double-staining with sybr green i for nuclei and mitotracker orange for mitochondria revealed epithelial cells in the pupal wing tissues  . the mitochondrial staining pattern  that was revealed by mitotracker orange was similar to the staining pattern of the ca2+ indicators at the cellular level, as shown in figure 2c, d.figure  <dig>

damage-associated production of ca2+ waves
because physical damage is known to induce small ectopic eyespots in the hindwings of this species of butterfly  <cit> , an intact hindwing was damaged by the tip of a needle in a background area of the basal region, producing a hole with a diameter of approximately 100–300 μm . in  <dig> of the  <dig> individuals treated, we observed both an increase in fluorescence intensity around the damaged site and clear expanding ca2+ waves radiating from the damaged site  at intervals of approximately 5 min . the expanding ring waves at a given site did not arise spontaneously from undamaged areas and were similar to those radiating from the immediate periphery of the prospective eyespot. indeed, in the remaining  <dig> cases treated, we also observed large increases in fluorescence intensity that changed over time without expanding movement immediately around the damaged site . in addition to the elevated ca2+ signal immediately around the damaged site, flickering intensity changes in small areas around the site were observed .figure  <dig>

we confirmed the previous finding  <cit>  that an ectopic pattern was induced in the adult hindwings after damage  in this species , although its induction in the adult wings required more severe damage than the induction of ca2+ waves . the induced ectopic pattern was composed of an outer black ring, middle orange ring, and bluish focal area, similar to a normal eyespot .

pharmacological modification of ca2+ waves
some chemicals have been reported to induce color pattern modifications when injected immediately after pupation. the first chemical modifier that was discovered for the injection of chemicals into pupae was sodium tungstate  <cit> , and heparin and other related chemicals were subsequently found to induce similar modifications  <cit> . additionally, thapsigargin, which is a chemical that affects the intracellular trafficking of ca2+, has been shown to increase dark-colored scales in this species  <cit> . to examine the possible effects of these chemicals on spontaneous ca2+ waves in real time, we first examined the length of time required for an injected dye to reach wing tissue. rhodamine  <dig> injected into the abdomen was detected in the wing tissue at 3–10 min after injection  .figure  <dig>

we defined  <dig> rois in the region of the wing tissue at which the prospective discal spot was located  . after we confirmed the recording of spontaneous ca2+ waves in the visual field in addition to the rois, thapsigargin was injected into the abdomen, which caused a transient increase in the intracellular ca2+ concentration and the disappearance of spontaneous waves at 3–10 min after injection  . injections of tungstate , heparin , and dimethyl sulfoxide   did not cause any changes in the spontaneous ca2+ waves .

we confirmed that thapsigargin  , tungstate  , and heparin   induced characteristic color pattern changes in the adult wings when injected into the abdomen. in contrast with normal wings, the thapsigargin-treated wings showed incomplete cover scale development  in  <dig> individuals . furthermore, increases in dark-colored scales and fuzzy boundaries of color pattern elements were observed in  <dig> individuals  in each category . in addition, the arrangement and fine structures of the scales appeared to be disturbed, as shown by the scanning electron microscope images and the dull, blue scale color .figure  <dig>

discussion
using a unique technique for imaging developing butterfly wings, we discovered spontaneous intercellular ca2+ waves that propagated slowly across pupal wings. our experimental system allowed for the non-invasive observation of developing wings in vivo, and the individual pupae used for imaging normally developed the full adult color patterns  <cit> , excluding the potential artifacts that may be associated with the experimental system. interestingly, ca2+ waves were not detected in larval wings in vivo , which suggests that they play developmental roles only in pupal wings.

for many waves, we were unable to find a clear point of origin or trajectory. we believe that this was largely because our visual field was not large enough to find originating points for the waves. additionally, wave interactions complicated this issue. variability in waves may be due to technical reasons, such as inherent individual variation, slightly different locations, the timing of recordings, uneven loading of the indicator from individual to individual and from location to location, and the level of bleaching of the indicator . it is worth noting that even the timing of gene expression in butterfly wings varies within a population during development  <cit> .

in contrast, some waves clearly originated from the immediate periphery of the prospective eyespot , the prospective discal spot , and the damaged site . wave patterns appeared to differ between the two regions examined  . these results suggest an involvement of ca2+ waves in wing development. physical damage  and pharmacological experiments  also support this interpretation. however, we admit that the present study is mainly descriptive, and a direct functional role of ca2+ waves cannot be rigorously proven by these methods because many other molecular pathways may be modified by physical damage and chemical injections, which could then indirectly change scale morphology and color patterns in the long term.

nonetheless, because many other studies have demonstrated instructive roles of ca2+ waves in developmental systems  <cit> , we believe that the butterfly wing system is not an outlier. indeed, ca2+ waves travel long distances in the liver and are terminated by annihilation collision with another wave front  <cit> , similar to our observations in butterfly wings. in zebrafish, spontaneous ca2+ waves coordinate cellular processes, including morphogenesis during development  <cit> . the waves appear to be generated from cells of morphological importance in the developing neocortex, such as s-phase cells  <cit> .

some specific aspects of butterfly ca2+ waves are noteworthy. first, the interactions between two or more ca2+ waves are diverse, but may have some general rules . for example, two progressive waves may fuse, but they may also collide with each other and decrease in intensity. in addition, two waves may occasionally form a spiral pattern around each other.figure  <dig>

waves.  four patterns of ca2+ waves and oscillations. notable features, velocity, and an estimated frequency of occurrence are indicated.  three patterns of wave interactions, fusion, annihilation collision, and spiral formation.



second, the frequency of individual waves also varied, but it was typically between  <dig> and 4 cycles in 10 min, roughly corresponding to  <dig> to  <dig> mhz. to detect this type of low-frequency wave, long-term real-time recordings are required, which were achieved with our system.

third, these waves are long-range. the maximum travel distance that we observed was approximately 1 mm, which is an underestimate because a greater distance is expected if the visual field under the microscope is wider or if the detection sensitivity of the system is higher. nonetheless, this 1-mm distance was exceptionally long, spanning at least 50– <dig> cells, given that a single epithelial cell is approximately 10–20 μm in diameter in pupal wing tissue   <cit> . these findings suggest that approximately  <dig> cells are involved in wave-generating activity when a wave propagates radially from a designated point in a two-dimensional plane . it is possible that a long-range wave may reach every single cell of a given wing surface, which may occasionally result in the wing-wide synchronization of waves.

fourth, ca2+ waves in the wings are slow, traveling at 1–10 μm/sec . the wing waves that we detected could be categorized as slow waves   <cit> , which have been hypothesized to be caused by stretch-sensitive channels that allow extracellular ca2+ flow into the cell  <cit> . this activity can occur in developing epithelial cells of butterfly wing tissues because each cell is conical in structure with relatively long dendritic processes; thus, the deep sides are likely to be physically flexible  <cit> . a more detailed morphological characterization of epithelial cells is currently underway in our laboratory.

fifth, the velocity of ca2+ waves appears to be distance-dependent , indicating that the initial velocity may determine the traveling distance. the waves appear to travel in a slightly decelerating motion. the velocity that was recorded in this study is similar to that of waves that have been detected in slime mold, in which they may be used for cellular integration  <cit> .

interestingly, ca2+ waves can be initiated by physical damage , which is reminiscent of those that have been induced in damaged fish skin  <cit> , cultured rat skin  <cit> , and damaged brain tissue  <cit> . it is therefore possible that damage-associated ca2+ waves play a role in producing ectopic eyespots.

the biological functions of ca2+ waves have also been assessed by pharmacological experiments . neither tungstate nor heparin, which are two known color-pattern modifiers, affects any aspect of ca2+ waves. dmso, which is used as a solvent of thapsigargin, also does not cause any change in these waves. in contrast, thapsigargin, which modifies background color  <cit> , transiently increases the intracellular ca2+ concentration and abolishes these waves, indicating that it functions as a ca2+-atpase inhibitor in the endoplasmic reticulum  membrane  <cit> . these short-term effects of thapsigargin, which were expected because of its well-known function, were observed immediately after injection, confirming its successful induction of er stress. because the specific effects of thapsigargin have been well established  <cit> , we believe that this short-term effect is caused by thapsigargin directly, and not by indirectly through unknown side effects.

the long-term effects of thapsigargin on scales in this species are known  <cit> , and similar effects have also been reported following ionomycin injection  <cit> . these pharmacological agents both work through elevating the cytosolic calcium concentration. therefore, it has been speculated that calcium may play a role in scale development  <cit> . in the present study, in addition to cover scale color, we demonstrated that thapsigargin also affected the arrangement, shape, microstructure, and formation of cover scales. it is unclear whether the short-term effects of thapsigargin eventually led to long-term phenotypic effects without any side effects. in other words, we do not know whether its effects on cover scales are direct or indirect results of the abolishment of ca2+ waves. however, we speculate that long-range, slow ca2+ waves may play important roles in multiple aspects of normal cover scale development. the disorder of the scales suggests that ca2+ waves may function as synchronization signals for cell growth and division, resulting in wing-wide phenotypic coordination  <cit> . alternatively, waves may be used for interactions between elements. it has been reported that the size and morphology of elements are affected by nearby elements  <cit> . to demonstrate a direct functional role of ca2+ waves in wing development, genetic manipulations may be required in the future. a relatively easy-to-use method is baculovirus-mediate gene transfer, which can be successfully used to deliver a gene into the wings of this butterfly species  <cit> .

the mechanism that underlies the intercellular propagation of ca2+ waves is currently unknown. inside a cell, mitochondria appear to play a similar role as in cochlear supporting cells  <cit> . as we could not detect any changes in color patterns or ca2+ waves when octanol, which is a general gap-junctional inhibitor, was injected , signaling may be mediated by a chemical  and a receptor via the extracellular space. the ca2+ waves detected in this study are somewhat similar to progressive waves from an organizing center that have been predicted by the induction model for positional information  <cit> . however, the morphogenic signal that is predicted by the induction model consists of ultra-slow waves that are more likely to be gene expression waves  <cit>  or other similar waves. the relationship between ca2+ waves and the predicted ultra-slow waves remains to be clarified. for example, wnt ligand, which may be involved in color-pattern formation  <cit> , may be induced by ca2+ waves.

CONCLUSIONS
this study detected, for the first time, spontaneously produced ca2+ waves that travel slowly over long distances during butterfly wing development. these findings were made possible by our technological advancements in butterfly wing live imaging. moreover, ca2+ waves were generated by physical damage, which is known to produce ectopic eyespots. thapsigargin injection abolished the ca2+ waves and resulted in abnormal scales and patterns. these results suggest that spontaneous ca2+ waves play critical roles in scale development and color pattern formation, which are involved in two-dimensional morphogenesis in butterfly wings. the discovery of long-range, slow ca2+ waves that may contribute to pattern formation is a significant advancement in the developmental biology of pattern formation  <cit>  and in signaling biology  <cit> .
