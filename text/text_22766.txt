BACKGROUND
the sperm annulus is a ring-like structure existing in all mammalian spermatozoa. this structure was identified  <dig> years ago and formerly called "jensen's ring". at low magnification, the annulus appears dense and homogeneous, but at high magnification it shows to be composed of closely packed filamentous subunits oriented circumferentially  <cit> .

during early spermiogenesis, a flagellar axoneme forms beneath the cell surface from one of the two centrioles, and rapidly protudes from the cell. the centriole pair forming the axoneme then move towards the nucleus and finally impacts it, which causes the cell membrane adherent to the centriole to become infolded  <cit> . as early as in this stage the annulus or the anlage of the annulus can be seen encircling the axoneme at the distal end of the basal body by electron microscopy  <cit> . during the late stage of sperm flagellum development, the annulus slips towards a more distal position, and the mitochondria begin to affix to the flagellum. in a mature spermatozoon the annulus is located between the midpiece and the principal piece of the flagellum, and beneath the plasma membrane, firmly connecting them together  <cit> .

recent researches show that the sperm annulus is a septin-based structure composed of several septins, such as sept <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . septins, conserved from yeast to drosophila to humans, are polymerizing gtpases that can form hetero-oligomeric filaments required for cytokinesis and other cellular processes  <cit> . the functional importance of septins in sperm annulus formation is illustrated by the sept4-deficient male mice. sept4-deficient male mice are sterile due to defective morphology and motility of the sperm flagella. mutant sperm lacking the annulus often show bent-back tail morphology at the midpiece-principal piece junction. therefore, cortical organization of the annulus based on circular assembly of septins is essential for the structural and mechanical integrity of mammalian spermatozoa  <cit> . to date, however, little is known about how the annulus/septin ring is assembled and positioned to the midpiece-principal piece junction during spermiogenesis. in vivo, mammalian septins may need extra factors or adaptors to organize higher-order structures, albeit their self-assembly into filamentous rings in vitro  <cit> . thus, the present study intends to examine the involvement of dnajb <dig>  a type ii heat shock protein  <dig> , in annulus assembly and positioning during mammalian sperm flagellum development.

hsp40s generally function as cochaperones in the hsp <dig> chaperone systems that are involved in many processes in cells, such as folding of newly synthesized proteins, refolding of misfolded proteins, translocation of proteins into organelles, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, and protein degradation  <cit> . we have previously shown that dnajb <dig> is a component of mouse sperm axoneme  <cit> . here we report that dnajb <dig> is associated with the annulus spatiotemporally during sperm flagellum development in wild type mice, and even present temporarily in the annulus-deficient sept4-null spermatids taking on an annulus-like pattern. in vitro dnajb <dig> interacts with sept <dig> directly. altogether, our data suggest that dnajb <dig> may assist in assembling the annulus and positioning it toward the midpiece-principal piece junction during sperm flagellum development.

RESULTS
dnajb <dig> localized to sperm annulus transiently during mouse spermiogenesis
with the specific antibody against mouse dnajb <dig>  we have demonstrated that dnajb <dig> is an axonemal component of flagella in mature spermatozoa  <cit> . surprisingly, when performing immunofluorescence microscopy on mouse testicular germ cells, we found that this antibody also labeled a ring-like structure in certain spermatids in addition to the axoneme. it is known that three kinds of ring-like structures form during mammalian spermatogenesis: intercellular bridges, the perinuclear ring of the manchette, and the annulus  <cit> . the ring-like structure labelled by this antibody on flagella prompted us to investigate whether or not dnajb <dig> localized to sperm annulus by co-staining with anti-sept <dig> antibody. sept <dig>  an annulus constituent, has been used to indicate the sperm annulus  <cit> . we then found that dnajb <dig> was co-localized with sept <dig>  but only in developing spermatids , not in mature epididymal spermatozoa . we also employed phase contrast microscopy to clearly demonstrate the sperm annulus , which was stained with dnajb <dig> antibody in parallel, showing that dnajb <dig> indeed localized to the sperm annulus.

due to the difference in signal intensity and angles of view, the annular dnajb <dig> staining exhibited three distinct patterns. in most cases, it showed a bar-like pattern ; but the ring-like pattern  was obvious when detached from flagella; it also displayed a two-dot pattern when the signal intensity was low, especially at the beginning of the annulus formation . in addition to its annulus location, dnajb <dig> staining on the same testicular cell preparation uncovered a discernible pattern. in a subset of spermatids, a small dot labelled with the antibody was kept apart from the annulus staining toward the distal end of the sperm flagellum . during sample preparation, some spermatids were damaged and their annuli were released. in this case, dnajb <dig> was still co-localized with sept <dig> on the ring-like structure , indicating that there may be a strong physical interaction between them.

spatiotemporal progression of annular dnajb <dig> during spermiogenesis
intrigued by our observation above, we employed immunofluorescence microscopy to follow the spatiotemporal progression of annular dnajb <dig> with the annulus during mouse spermiogenesis in detail. in order to define each step in spermiogenesis, we combined the antibody staining with dapi  and mitotracker . because it is difficult for us to demonstrate  <dig> colors in one sample, we stained the testicular germ cells with the sept <dig> antibody and the dnajb <dig> antibody separately.

the annulus indicated by the sept <dig> immunofluorescent signal first appeared in step  <dig> spermatids , not in step  <dig> spermatids . it kept staying at the neck region until the spermatids developed to early step  <dig> , and after that it slipped down to its distal position followed by the formation of the mitochondrial sheath . of note, sept <dig> was still present at the midpiece-principal piece junction of mature spermatozoa . it has been shown by electron microscopy that the annulus can be detected shortly after the flagellum formation and migration toward the nucleus in the early stage of cat spermiogenesis  <cit> . in chinese hamster spermiogenesis, the anlage of the annulus is first detected in spermatids in which the centriolar pair forming the flagellum has reached and impacted the nucleus  <cit> . correspondingly, the flagellum forms in step 2– <dig> spermatids, then migrates inwards and finally reaches and indents the nucleus in step  <dig> spermatids in both rat and mouse spermiogenesis  <cit> . however, with immunofluorescence microscopy, we were unable to detect the annulus structure even in step  <dig> spermatids, probably due to the sensitivity difference between the two methodologies, or the developmental difference among different species, or because the annulus prior to step  <dig> is not septin-based. indeed, early ultrastructural studies in rat and mouse spermatids show that the annulus cannot be clearly seen until step  <dig>  <cit> , and stays at the neck region from step  <dig> to early step  <dig>  <cit> , consistent with our present findings.

coincident with the appearance of annulus demonstrated by the sept <dig> antibody, the annulus-like dnajb <dig> immunofluorescence signal was also first seen in step  <dig> spermatids , not in earlier step spermatids . the signal intensity of annular dnajb <dig> increased as the spermiogenesis proceeded . it peaked when the annulus migrated down to its most distal position, and afterwards decreased gradually with the formation and maturation of mitochondrial sheath . in contrast to sept <dig> staining , dnajb <dig> was absent at the midpiece-principal piece junction of mature spermatozoa . the nuclear staining  and mitochondrial staining  used to define steps of spermiogenesis were merged with the dnajb <dig> staining to clearly show the whole progression . as shown in figure 1a, figures 3d, e, f, g, h, i and 3j detailed the migrating progress of both dnajb13-labeled dot and annulus towards the midpiece-principal piece junction on the tail. the dnajb <dig> dot appeared around step 13– <dig> , a time point slightly before annulus migration , advanced toward the midpiece-principal piece junction , and then stayed there . the dnajb13-labeled annulus followed the dnajb <dig> dot downwards , and eventually merged with it at the midpiece-principal piece junction . these data indicate that the annular dnajb <dig> and the dnajb <dig> dot may be involved in positioning of the annulus.

localization of dnajb <dig> in sept4-null spermatids
to further study the relationship between dnajb <dig> and the annulus, we examined the localization of dnajb <dig> in sept4-null mouse spermatids. surprisingly we found that dnajb <dig> was still present at the neck region of the flagellum, displaying either a ring-like or two-dot pattern from step  <dig> to early step  <dig> . however, the intensity of the annulus-like dnajb <dig> staining in sept4-null spermatids was consistently low and steady, compared to that in wild type spermatids . perhaps due to lack of the annulus in the sept4-null spermatids, the annulus-like dnajb <dig> staining disappeared soon and was undetectable in middle step  <dig> of the sept4-null spermatids . these data indicate that the annulus-like dnajb <dig> appears prior to formation of the septin-based annulus, and further that it may assist in assembling the septin-based annulus.

as in wild type, the dnajb13-positive dot was able to be detected on flagella of the sept4-null spermatids, and also migrated towards the midpiece-principal piece junction . therefore, its presence and migration are likely to be independent of annulus. since the mitochondrial sheath is still formed in sept4-null spermatids  <cit> , the dot may play a role in mitochondrial sheath orientation in the absence of annulus.

in vitro dnajb <dig> co-localized and interacted with sept4
in an effort to determine whether dnajb <dig> and sept <dig> interact in vivo, we first made the testicular lysate. however, the great majority of testicular sept <dig> was detergent-insoluble . we then turned to an in vitro assay by constructing plasmids expressing gfp-tagged dnajb <dig> and flag-tagged sept <dig> respectively, co-transfecting them into hela s <dig> cells, and then performing both immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation  analyses.

the immunofluorescence result showed that gfp-dnajb <dig> was co-localized with flag-sept <dig> in hela cells , consistent with the in vivo findings. the co-ip result showed that flag-sept <dig> could be co-immunoprecipitated with gfp-dnajb <dig> by anti-gfp antibody , indicating that dnajb <dig> and sept <dig> interact directly. the same results were also obtained in u2os and cho cell lines . it is known that hsp40s homodimerize via their c-terminals to capture substrates  <cit> . in fact, rsp <dig> , the chlamydomonas orthologue of dnajb <dig>  can form homodimer  <cit> . we indeed found that dnajb <dig> could homodimerize in hela s <dig> cells . taken together, these data indicate that in vivo dnajb <dig> may interact with sept <dig> via its homodimers.

CONCLUSIONS
by performing immunofluorescence and biochemical approaches, we for the first time revealed a spatiotemporal association of dnajb <dig>  a type ii hsp <dig>  with the sperm annulus and elucidated a relationship between dnajb <dig> and the annular constituent sept <dig>  with closer inspection of the annulus-deficient spermatids from sept4-null mice, we here tentatively propose a model of how dnajb <dig> is involved in the assembly and positioning of sperm annulus. in the early stage of sperm flagellum development, dnajb <dig> forms an annular anlage, or attaches to a pre-existing annular anlage, and then recruits septins through direct interaction with sept <dig> or sept4-containing septin complex to build up a genuine annulus. in the late stage of sperm flagellum development, dnajb <dig> may assist the migration of the annulus, and meanwhile forms a dot on the flagellum to direct the annulus toward the midpiece-principal piece junction. as the annulus is positioned to the midpiece-principal piece junction, dnajb <dig> disappears gradually with formation and maturation of the mitochondrial sheath.
