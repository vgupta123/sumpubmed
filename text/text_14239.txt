BACKGROUND
new genes provide novel traits to organisms and thus contribute to the adaption of species to new ecological niches
 <cit> . the mechanisms by which organisms acquire new genes have been intensively studied and the rapidly accumulating genomic data have further supported the idea that most genes were originated from duplication events
 <cit> . besides gene duplication, retroposition, exon shuffling, trans-splicing, and de novo gene evolution, horizontal gene transfer  represents another critical source of gaining novel genes by directly introducing new genes to distantly related recipient species
 <cit> .

a large number of hgt events have been recognized in prokaryotes
 <cit>  and unicellular eukaryotes
 <cit> . although in multicellular animals, the separation of germ line cells from the soma expectedly leads to low hgt frequencies, genes of prokaryotic, fungal or plant origins have been discovered in diverse animals including bdelloid rotifer
 <cit> , tunicates
 <cit> , jelly fishes
 <cit> , starlet sea anemones
 <cit> , nematodes
 <cit> , aphids
 <cit>  and other insects
 <cit> . the evolutionary significance of hgt has been well illustrated in some animals. for instance, acquiring two carotenoid biosynthetic genes from fungi endowed the pea aphids with red body color, based on which the variation between green and red aphids is further driven by the predators and parasites
 <cit> .

hgt is also involved in the adaptation and genome evolution of plants
 <cit> . in nonvascular plants, yue et al. identified  <dig> gene families in a moss nuclear genome with prokaryotic, fungal, and viral origins
 <cit> . most of these genes were most likely transferred to the ancestor of green plants and may have played significant roles during the transition of plants from being aquatic to terrestrial
 <cit> . extensive hgt has occurred between the organellar genomes of higher plants
 <cit> . however, gene transfer between plant nuclear genomes was rarely reported
 <cit> . some exceptions are that a mu-like element  in higher plants was found to be transferred between rice and setaria nuclear genomes
 <cit> , and similarly, four independent genes in the c <dig> photosynthesis pathway were recurrently transferred from c <dig> to c <dig> plants in panicoideae, and such hgt events may explain the origin of c <dig> plants in different species
 <cit> . these hgts were all between nuclear genomes and it is still unclear how these hgt events happened, since there are no direct physical interactions between donors and recipients.

physical contact between the donors and the recipients theoretically facilitate hgt occurrence, since it increases the chance of genetic material transfer
 <cit> . parasites and hosts can form long-lasting intimate physical contact and thus parasitism may result in relatively high frequencies of hgt
 <cit> . consistent with this scenario, the majority of hgt events in higher plants found so far are from plant parasitic systems. in plants, hundreds of host organelle genes have been reported to be transferred from hosts to parasites
 <cit> , or vice versa
 <cit> , with most being targeted to the recipient mitochondria. in contrast, only few cases of hgt between the nuclear genomes of parasitic plants and hosts were reported
 <cit> . the first confirmed hgt in parasitic systems involving nuclear genomes was that a gene with unknown function was transferred from a monocot host  to the eudicot parasite plant striga hermonthica <cit> , and this was detected by analyzing the expressed sequence tags of s. hermonthica. with the rapid development of the next-generation sequencing technologies, increasing amount of transcriptome data become available. rafflesia cantleyi  is an obligate and holoparasitic plant, and by screening the transcriptome data of this parasite and its obligate host tetrastigma rafflesiae, xi et al. proposed that several dozen genes were transferred from the host to the parasite, with most probably encoded by the nuclear genomes
 <cit> . likewise, zhang et al. found that an albumin gene, encoding a seed storage and insect toxin protein, was transferred from legumes to the root parasitic plant orobanche aegyptiaca and shoot parasitic plant cuscuta pentagona and probably retained the same function after hgt
 <cit> .

plants in the genus orobanche  are root parasites and form one of the largest groups of holoparasitic plants. most orobanche species have a narrow host range, while o. aegyptiaca is one of the exceptions, as it parasitizes many plants including brassicaceae, leguminosae, solanaceae, apiaceae, asteraceae, and cucurbitaceae
 <cit> . o. aegyptiaca is mainly distributed in mediterranean region and western asia and can also been found sporadically in africa, australia, america, and eastern asia
 <cit> . cuscuta  plants are shoot parasites and represent another group of obligate parasitic plants, and most members of this genus have broad host ranges, which greatly overlap with the plant families infected by o. aegyptiaca <cit> , and have a wide geographic distribution that is similar to that of o. aegyptiaca <cit> .

the inconsistence between a species tree and a gene tree is an important indication of the occurrence of hgt. the genome data of mimulus guttatus and solanum , the ordinal relatives of orobanche and cuscuta respectively, have been released
 <cit> . m. guttatus  and o. aegyptiaca belong to the order lamiales, and solanum spp.  and c. australis  belong to the order solanales. the available genomic information from m. guttatus and solanum has provided an excellent opportunity for identifying hgt in orobanche and cuscuta. here, we report that strictosidine synthase-like  genes from brassicaceae were co-opted by the two parasitic plants, o. aegyptiaca and c. australis. furthermore, these ssl genes belong to a new member of the ssl gene family and were originated by gene duplication uniquely in brassicaceae. the presence of introns in the foreign ssls of parasitic plants strongly suggests that host dna, but not mrna, was directly integrated into o. aegyptiaca and c. australis respectively. furthermore, the expression levels of the ssl genes in o. aegyptiaca and c. australis varied in different developmental stages and organs and the ssl gene in c. australis was inducible after wounding. these results support the scenario that during parasitization nuclear genes can be transferred from hosts to parasitic plants, and the foreign genes may provide their new hosts with novel traits, which might be beneficial for adaptation.

RESULTS
identification of foreign ssl genes in orobanche aegyptiaca and cuscuta australis
o. aegyptiaca is a root holoparasitic plant that parasitizes many plant species. recently, a large set of transcriptome data was released . taking advantage of these published databases, we downloaded the assembled transcriptomes of o. aegyptiaca and screened for foreign genes . more than  <dig> sequences were obtained initially which were predicted as hgt candidates by alieng
 <cit> . among these, a 691-bp transcript fragment showed  <dig> and 89% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively, to a strictosidine synthase-like  gene in arabidopsis thaliana  , while it was highly divergent from the homologs in orobanche relative mimulus guttatus . to obtain the complete ssl transcript sequence, we re-assembled the rna-seq datasets of o. aegyptiaca using trinity
 <cit>  and obtained a 1597-bp cdna sequence with a putatively complete open reading frame  encoding  <dig> amino acids .

considering that the shoot parasitic plant c. australis also parasitizes brassicaceous plants, we investigated whether c. australis also gained the ssl gene. a homemade transcriptome assembly of c. australis was searched using oassl as the query, and  <dig> highly similar transcripts were found, which were very likely derived from one gene by alternative splicing . this c. australis ssl  also showed high similarities with the same arabidopsis ssl at the nucleotide and amino acid level , but exhibited much lower similarities with its solanales homologs in s. tuberosum and s. lycopersicum . these data strongly suggested that these two parasitic plants acquired a ssl gene from arabidopsis or certain other brassicaceous species.

to gain insight into the evolution of ssl genes and rule out the possibility that oassl and cassl were originated from non-brassicaceous plants, ssl sequences from  <dig> representative plant genomes and the two parasitic plants were used for constructing a gene tree . phylogenetic analysis using all ssl members in arabidopsis and the representative homolog sequences from other species  revealed that ssl gene family contained two highly divergent clusters, cluster i and cluster ii, and multiple subfamilies. cluster i comprised  <dig> subfamilies with each containing homologs from the major clades of land plants, including eudicots and monocots; cluster ii contained  <dig> subfamilies, among which sub-family vii  was only composed of the homologs from eudicots but the other  <dig> subfamilies included homologs from both eudicots and monocots. transcriptome analysis revealed that both parasitic plants contain multiple ssl copies,  <dig> copies in o. aegyptiaca belonging to  <dig> subfamilies and  <dig> copies in c. australis from  <dig> subfamilies.

sub-vii contained  <dig> clades, clade i and clade ii. although clade i contained homologs from diverse species of eudicots, clade ii only included ssl sequences from brassicales and the  <dig> parasitic plants , and the oassl and cassl clustered with  <dig> arabidopsis ssl genes with 100% bootstrap support. thus, clade ii may be originated in brassicales by gene duplication from clade i before the divergence of brassicales , and oassl and cassl were very likely derived from brassicaceae by hgt.

to gain more insight into the potential gene donors of the ssl genes in orobanche and cuscuta, we collected all ssl sequences from species with available genome sequences and also from the transcriptome assemblies of  <dig> shoot parasitic plants, cuscuta pentagona , cassytha filiformis , and pilostyles thurberi  from the 1kp project , and  <dig> root parasitic plants, triphysaria versicolor and striga hermonthica from the parasitic plant genome project
 <cit> . phylogenetic analysis showed that only certain brassicaceae ssl genes clustered closely with oassl and cassl. all these sequences clustered were used to infer the specific origins of foreign ssls. the tree showed  <dig> groups, group i to iii, and the ssl genes from the two parasitic plants were assigned to group ii with 100% bootstrap support . importantly, both oassl and cassl shared a single amino acid deletion and multiple unique amino acids that are uniquely conserved in group ii ssl proteins . these results indicated that oassl and cassl were originated from brassicaceae, although we were not able to determine the exact donor species, since oassl and cassl showed ambiguous relationships with other species in group ii .

the structures of brassicaceae-specific ssl genes, oassl in o. aegyptiaca, and cassl in c. australis
comparison of  <dig> ssl mrna sequences with their respective genomic dna sequences in  <dig> brassicaceae species indicated that brassicaceae ssl genes contained maximally  <dig> introns and among them  <dig> genes lacked the first intron. the positions of intron  <dig> and intron  <dig> were well conserved but the intron lengths varied within and between species .

only one copy of oassl transcript was identified in the transcriptome of o. aegyptiaca. using genomic dna as the template, we cloned its genomic sequence : it contained  <dig> introns, whose positions were identical to the intron  <dig> and  <dig> of the ssl genes in brassicaceae . analysis of c. australis transcriptome assembly revealed  <dig> isoforms of cassl, which were named seq <dig>  and seq <dig> . seq <dig> shared 100% identity with seq <dig> except that seq <dig> had a 21-bp insertion . the insertion was located at the same position as intron  <dig> in brassicaceae-specific ssl genes, thus seq <dig> was very likely originated from partial retention of intron  <dig>  the putative protein sequences of seq <dig> and seq <dig> aligned well with ssls from brassicaceae without any frame shifts, suggesting that seq <dig> and seq <dig> encode functional proteins . genomic pcr was used to amplify the sequence of cassl gene, but various primers spanning the intron region failed to produce any products. we speculate that the intron in cassl may have complex secondary structures or may be very long. intron  <dig> was obviously absent in cassl .

by hgt, dna can be transferred into nuclear, plastidal, or mitochondrial genomes of plants. all currently known brassicaceae-specific ssl genes are encoded by the nuclear genomes. nuclear or mitochondrial genomes from orobanche or cuscuta genera are not available, but a blast search of multiple chloroplast genomes of cuscuta species
 <cit>   indicated that none of the plastidal genomes contained homologs of cassl gene. we speculate that the cassl gene is likely in the nuclear genome of c. australis, although the possibilities of being in chloroplast or mitochondrial genome could not be completely ruled out. this might be also true for the oassl in o. aegyptiaca, since the current plastid genomes from orobanche do not possess the ssl genes
 <cit> .

expression analysis of atssl <dig> in a. thaliana, oassl in o. aegyptiaca, and cassl in c. australis
because no functional studies have been reported for the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes, we chose the atssl <dig> gene in arabidopsis , which showed the highest similarities to oassl in o. aegyptiaca and cassl in c. australis, as a representative and investigated its expression profile in various developmental stages, and after diverse stress stimuli and treatments using genevestigator
 <cit> . atssl <dig> was expressed in all developmental stages at rather similar levels . strong up-regulation of atssl <dig> expression was observed in inflorescence stem upon addition of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and in roots inoculated with the nematode heterodera schachtii; a large down-regulation was found in root after low oxygen treatment . therefore, we speculated that atssl <dig> might be involved in plant development and stress responses.

to gain insight into the potential function of oassl gene in o. aegyptiaca, we examined the expression profiles of oassl using the paired-end rna-seq datasets in ppgp generated from different developmental stages of o. aegyptiaca <cit>  . oassl shows 3- to 5-fold increased transcript abundance during haustorial formation and vegetable growth stages , suggesting that oassl gene might perform functions in haustorial formation and vegetable growth.

given that there are no public transcriptome databases available for cuscuta spp., quantitative real time-pcr  was done to measure the expression levels of cassl in c. australis in different developmental stages and after wound treatment. because selection of suitable reference genes is important for qpcr assay, four commonly used reference genes, actin, ef-1α, ef-tu, and pp2a, were evaluated with genorm
 <cit> , deltact
 <cit> , bestkeeper
 <cit> , normfinder
 <cit> , and reffinder
 <cit> . the result showed that ef-1α was stably expressed under all conditions . thus, ef-1α was used as the reference gene. cassl was expressed at all  <dig> different developmental stages or organs , and the highest expression level was found in mature stems and the lowest was in shoot tips  . additionally the transcriptional levels of cassl before and  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 24 h after wounding were determined. the expression level of the cassl gene was up-regulated  <dig> -fold 1 h after treatment and increased over time  . these results imply that cassl might be involved in development and abiotic stresses, such as wounding.

functional divergence and selection analysis
compared with its original gene copies , the brassicaceae-specific genes  present as a relatively long branch in the phylogenetic tree, which suggests that functional divergence between the two subfamilies probably had occurred after the gene duplication event. to evaluate this scenario, two types of functional divergence  between these two subfamilies were estimated by posterior analysis with diverge 2
 <cit> . type i functional divergence  represents the conserved amino acid sites in one clade but highly variable in the other; type ii functional divergence detected the conserved amino acid sites in both clades but with changed biochemical properties
 <cit> . the coefficient of type i functional divergence was significantly greater than  <dig>  and  <dig> amino acid sites possessed a posterior probability higher than  <dig> , which suggested that functional constrains on these  <dig> sites had shifted for most members between the two clades. no type ii-related radical changes happened between the two clades after gene duplication. these results suggested that type i functional divergence was the dominant patter for the genes in clade i and clade ii and altered site-specific selective constrains probable had led to group-specific functional changes between them.

we further investigated whether strong selection was involved in the evolution of the ssl genes in clade i and ii  using likelihood ratio tests developed by yang et al.
 <cit> . we firstly used the site models to detect whether positive selection occurred in some sites among the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes, their original copies, and the foreign ssl genes in the two parasitic plants. no positive selection was detected in these genes . notably, the maximum likelihood estimates of the value under m <dig> model approached  <dig>   <dig>  in the large dataset  and  <dig>  in the small dataset . the log-likelihood differences between models m <dig> and m <dig> were statically different for both the large dataset  and the small dataset  . these suggested that relaxed purifying selection was the main driving force in the evolution of these genes.

under the branch-site models, the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis were examined by setting the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes and each of the two parasitic genes separately as foreground. no evidence indicated that positive selection acted on the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes and the cassl gene in c. australis . however, two codon sites in the oassl gene of o. aegyptiaca have probably undergone positive selection  with more than 75% posterior probability . codon  <dig> encoded a glycine  or arginine  in the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes, whereas it encoded an asparagine  in the oassl gene of o. aegyptiaca; site  <dig> was a serine  in the oassl gene, which showed a  <dig>  posterior probability of positive selection, while it encoded an asparagine  or glutamic acid  in the brassicaceae-specific genes .

discussion
the brassicaceae-specific ssl genes and the alien origins of ssl genes in the parasitic plants o. aegyptiaca and c. australis
the ssl genes in plants constitute a large gene family that shows high levels of divergence among different subfamilies. among them, sub-vii is relatively special since it includes one clade  containing ssl genes from different species of eudicots and the other clade  only has species from brassicales and the two parasitic plants studied in present work. it is very likely that ssl genes in clade ii were formed only in brassicales via gene duplication of an ancestral ssl gene in clade i.

intriguingly, in this work we found that two ssl genes of brassicaceae have been introduced to the two parasitic plants by horizontal gene transfer. this is strongly supported by the following evidence: 1) high identity values in the multiple sequence alignment, 2) shared indels and amino acids, and 3) robust bootstrap values in the phylogeny analyses. from these lines of evidence, the possibility of convergent evolution can be ruled out. because o. aegyptiaca and c. australis belong to different taxa, the gene transfer events leading to the two foreign genes in the two distantly related parasitic plants should occur independently.

the possible transfer mechanism
the existence of introns in oassl and cassl gene sequences indicates that both gene transfer events occurred not at the mrna level but at the dna level. similarly, it was reported that the foreign albumin gene in o. aegyptiaca also contains introns and thus should be transferred as dna
 <cit> . parasitic plants are known to transport thousands of mrnas from their hosts
 <cit> ; however, it is likely that dna, but not mrna, transferred from a plant to another is the major form of hgt in plants. probably this is because mrna has to be reversed transcribed to dna before they could be integrated into a plant genome and the activity of this type of reverse transcription is extremely low.

the occurrence of any hgt event at dna level in plants requires multiple steps: 1) entering the cytoplasm after crossing the cell wall and cell membrane, 2) entering the nucleus through the nuclear membrane, 3) integration into the genome, 4) fixation and transfer to the next generation, 5) spread inside the population. the proposed mechanisms of hgt in plants include illegitimate pollination, vector-mediated, and plant-plant contact hypothesis
 <cit> . illegitimate pollination hypothesis presumes that the pollen grains of the gene donors can germinate on the stigma of the reproductive isolated species, after pollination, recombination may allow some foreign genes to be integrated into the other set of chromosomes, and hybrids with the same species and natural selection may lead to the retain of the target chromosome set with some foreign genes within the population. this hgt mechanism is considered to occur between closely related species, such as the hgt cases between setaria and oryza <cit> , between poa and festuca <cit> , or between c <dig> and c <dig> species in alloteropsis <cit> . because both o. aegyptiaca and c. australis are distantly related with brassicaceae, the illegitimate pollination hypothesis is very unlikely.

the vector-mediated transfer hypothesis assumes that viruses, pathogens, endophytes, or other media act as vectors to transfer the foreign dna into the recipients. because most vectors have limited host ranges, vector-mediated hgt from brassicaceae  to orobanchaceae and convolvulaceae appears to be unlikely. only vectors with a wide host range, such as apple latent spherical virus
 <cit> , may be able to mediate these transfer events. however, no plant viruses carrying the foreign genes have been discovered so far. this is possibly due to fast replication of virus which may cause loss of foreign genes during amplification. evidence of virus carrying foreign genes is needed to confirm the vector-mediated hgt as a plausible mechanism.

plant-plant contact hypothesis suggests that the foreign dna is imported into the recipients via the direct contact between plants, such as the long-term intimate contact in parasitic systems. parasitism establishes a functional symplastic pathway between parasitic plant and host, allowing transport of nutrients, rnas
 <cit> , proteins
 <cit> , viruses
 <cit> , and phytoplasma
 <cit>  from the hosts to the parasites. currently, no direct evidence indicates that host dna molecules can be transported into parasitic plants, but movement of large dna fragments and even whole chloroplasts has been observed in the graft regions between the same species
 <cit>  or between sexually incompatible species
 <cit> . the connections between parasitic plants and their hosts are highly similar to the artificial graft junctions; thus, regardless of whether the transfer of dna is limited to cell-to-cell in a short range or can occur in relatively long distances, the fusion of host and parasite vascular systems provides possibilities for foreign dna to travel to the recipients. because the concentration of imported macromolecules also decreases along the stems
 <cit> , the probability for the integration of foreign genetic materials decreases with the distance from the haustoria. we hypothesize that brassicaceae ssl genes were firstly integrated to the cells of o. aegyptiaca and c. australis haustoria or nearby tissues, and certain cells somehow developed into floral meristems, allowing the host genes to pass to the next generations.

functional implication of the foreign ssl genes in o. aegyptiaca and c. australis
the initial biochemical evidence for the function of a ssl gene was from rauvolfia serpentina, in which the activity of a strictosidine synthase  that catalyzes the stereospecific condensation of tryptamine and secologanin to form strictosidine  was detected
 <cit> , and later, the coding gene was cloned
 <cit> . because strictosidine is the key intermediate in indole alkaloid biosynthesis, which is the precursor of several clinically useful anti-cancer alkaloids, the str genes were successively elucidated in catharanthus roseus <cit> , rauwolfia verticillata <cit> , and ophiorrhiza japonica <cit> . however, compared with the catalytic feature and the active site information in the 3d-structure of strs
 <cit> , hickes et al. suggested that the great majority of sequences annotated as str do not catalyze the pictet-spengler reaction
 <cit> .

we added all sequences encoding proteins with confirmed str activity in our comprehensive phylogenetic analysis, and they clustered as a highly supported clade . one sequence from vitis vinifera  is related to those with verified str activity in our phylogenetic tree. no str activities but hydrolytic activities were detected in this ssl gene of v. vinifera <cit> . given the low sequence similarities and distant relationships of the genes in clade ii to the real strs, the brassicaceae-specific and the foreign ssl genes in the parasitic plants probably do not catalyze the pictet-spengler reaction. we found that the ssl genes in arabidopsis and the parasitic plants are actively transcribed in multiple developmental stages and following different treatments, but their biological functions need to be further studied.

parasitic plants face at least two challenges. first, they need to conquer host defenses while at the same time absorbing nutrients from the hosts; second, they have to resist herbivores, bacteria, fungi, or abiotic environment stresses, such as wounding. previous work had indicated that transferred genes in nematodes from microorganism may have enabled the parasites to modulate the host defense systems
 <cit> . parasitic oomycetes probably acquired certain secretory proteins from fungi, which inhabit the same niche with the oomycetes, and thus are able to suppress certain host defense responses
 <cit> . data-mining in the public microarray database revealed that the most related arabidopsis atssl <dig> also responds to the treatments of hormones, abiotic and biotic stresses. oassl in o. aegyptiaca showed different expression levels at different developmental stages and had undergone positive selection. similarly, in c. australis, cassl also exhibited developmental stage- and organ-specific expression levels; furthermore, wounding transcriptionally activated cassl. therefore, the foreign ssl genes in the two parasitic plants might be involved in plant development and secondary metabolism, which is normally associated with herbivore and pathogen resistance
 <cit>  or other environmental stresses
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
hgt from the host nuclear genome to parasitic plants has been rarely reported so far, here we provide solid evidence indicating that two nuclear-encoded ssl genes from brassicaceae species were co-opted by two distantly related holoparasitic plants, the root parasitic plant o. aegyptiaca and the shoot parasitic plants c. australis. thus, the physical connection with host plant and the parasitic lifestyle including the transport of host nutrients and macromolecules may give parasites the opportunity to obtain host genes by hgt, and hgt between host and parasitic plant nuclear genomes may not be very rare. our analysis also suggests a potential role of the horizontally transferred genes in the evolution and adaptation to parasitic lifestyle or environment.
