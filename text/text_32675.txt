BACKGROUND
in a day, millions of people use drinking water and in some areas in which the quality of tap drinking water is low, consumption of bottled mineral water is common. bottled mineral waters are a rich sources of trace elements copper, zinc, and iron and also magnesium, fluorine, sodium, and calcium. their consumption is routine in hotels, restaurants, airplanes and other vehicles and also medical practitioners usually prescribe these kinds of waters for patients with malnutrition. low risk of water-borne pathogens and chemical toxins exist for bottled drinking water, increasing their consumption over the time. in keeping with this, there are some reports regarding the contamination of these kinds of water with dangerous pathogens such as helicobacter pylori, vibrio cholera, salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli  <cit> .

h. pylori is a gram negative, micro-aerophilic and flagellated bacterium which is known as a causative agent of gastric adenocarcinoma, type b gastritis and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma  <cit> . in fact, h. pylori colonization in gastric mucosa is the primary cause of ulcers in the stomach and duodenum  <cit> . documented data revealed that near  <dig> % of world populations have been infected with h. pylori  <cit> . in keeping with this, its exact routes of transmission and origin are still unknown  <cit> . based on the fecal–oral and oral–oral transmission routes of the h. pylori, contaminated water can play an important role in spread of h. pylori to humans  <cit> .

colonization and invasion of h. pylori to gastric mucous is dependent on a number of virulence factors. some of the most important virulence factors of this bacterium are the vacuolating cytotoxin , induced by contact with the epithelium antigen , cytotoxin associated gene , blood group antigen-binding adhesion  and outer inflammatory protein  . the vaca gene is polymorphic, comprising variable signal regions  and mid-regions . the s <dig> type is further subtyped into s1a, s1b and s1c subtypes and the m <dig> into m1a and m1b subtypes. the icea gene has two main allelic variants icea <dig> and icea <dig> but their functions are not yet clear. the caga gene has been detected in the specimens taken from the severe cases of peptic ulcer . cage is  <dig> of  <dig> genes located within the pathogenicity island shown to induce secretion of chemokines, such as interleukin il- <dig>  and induce inflammation  <cit> . the oipa gene plays a significant role in effective colonization of bacteria into the mucosa  <cit> . genotyping using these virulence markers is considered as one of the best approaches for the study of relationships between h. pylori isolates from different samples.

efficient antibiotic therapy is one of the best approaches for treatment of infectious diseases transmitted through water. water-borne h. pylori infections are no exception to this principle. however, therapeutic protocols have become somewhat limited because of the presence of multidrug resistant strains of this bacterium  <cit> .

consumption of bottled mineral water is so common among iranian people. besides, the prevalence of h. pylori is considerable among iranian sources of infection and other sites of the wold . therefore, study the important role of contaminated water as a risk factor for transmission of h. pylori is essential. these important points and also lack of community studies in relation to antibiotic resistance pattern of water-borne h. pylori,caused us to carried out the present study in order to investigate the exact status of vaca, caga, icea, oipa, cage and baba <dig> genotypes status and antibiotic resistance pattern of h. pylori isolates of iranian bottled mineral water samples.

discussion
the present research was carried out to study the prevalence of h. pylori in the bottled mineral water samples of  <dig> major brands in iran as well as to determine the distribution of vaca, caga, cage, icea, oipa and baba <dig> genotype status and antibiotic resistance patterns of h. pylori isolates. to our best knowledge, this is the first prevalence report of genotyping and antimicrobial resistance properties of h. pylori in the bottled mineral water samples in the world. we found that  <dig>  % of bottled mineral water samples were contaminated with resistant and virulent strains of h. pylori. with respect to the high accuracy which were performed on the producing of mineral water, our results reported a significant public health concern.

in contrast to findings of our investigation, watson et al.   <cit>  failed to isolate h. pylori from drinking water samples of united kingdom. isolation of h. pylori using the culture media is important due to the necessity of detecting viable bacteria in water. previous investigation in iran  <cit>  showed that the distribution of h. pylori in various types of water samples including tap water, dental units’ water and water cooler of public places had the ranges of 2– <dig> %, which was higher than our results. nurgalieva et al.   <cit>  revealed that river water was a high risk factor for h. pylori infection in kazakhstan. accordingly, they stated that transmission of h. pylori could be waterborne. drinking water can pose a substantial threat for transmission of h. pylori because of several important criteria  <cit> . these criteria include the ability of h. pylori to adhere to different materials and to co-aggregate with other bacteria and form complex structures on pipes or other surfaces in contact with water  <cit> . notion about the disability of h. pylori to survive alone in running water, but to develop a symbiotic relationship and form complex structures on contact surfaces  <cit> , makes it rational to assume that groundwater is a reservoir for h. pylori due to its stagnant nature. according to the high application of groundwater in the production of bottled mineral water, it is not surprising that  <dig>  % of our samples were positive for this bacterium. several investigations have shown a considerable prevalence of h. pylori in the ground water samples between years 1999– <dig> in united sates  and japan  <cit> .

other possible reasons for the high prevalence of h. pylori in bottled mineral water samples in iran are a) lack of competent approaches for water sanitization b) expending the distrustful groundwater for producing the bottled mineral water c) the opportunity of presence of bacterial colonies as a biofilm in the in pipes used for water transfer d) the opportunity of leakage of household, industrial and agricultural wastewater to the sources of mineral water and finally e) lack of personal hygiene of refinery room’s staffs. according to the high prevalence of h. pylori in bottled mineral water samples, it can be concluded that the food safety regulations as well as quality standards—including good manufacturing practices , good agricultural practices  and hazard analysis and critical control points —are not introduced for iranian mineral water factories.

marked monthly distribution with the higher prevalence in july month was seen in the h. pylori strains of bottled mineral water. the main reason for the higher prevalence of h. pylori in summer is the fact that during these times of the year climatic events including temperature, rain and barometric pressure may have influence on the prevalence of this bacterium. bacteria have the higher growth and occurrence in warm condition. yahaghi et al.   <cit>  reported a similar seasonal distribution for the h. pylori strains of vegetable and salad samples. they showed statistically significant differences for the incidence of h. pylori between hot and cold seasons of the year.

consumption of contaminated bottled mineral water of our study may lead to the gastrointestinal disorders, because of the presence of resistant and virulent strains of h. pylori. all of h. pylori isolates of our investigation were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agents. in keeping with this,  <dig>  % of isolates were resistant to more than  <dig> antimicrobial agents. in addition, the highest levels of resistance were seen against six types of antimicrobial agents. these antimicrobial agents are the best choices for treatment of the cases of infection with h. pylori. in fact, in most cases of peptic ulcer diseases with the sign of h. pylori infection, these antimicrobial agents are used. unfortunately, prescription of these types of antibiotics are usually irregular and over than allowance levels. therefore, it is not surprising that majority of h. pylori strains were resistant to these antimicrobial agents. similar results have been described by bang et al.   <cit> , thyagarajan et al.   <cit> , yahaghi et al.   <cit>  and secka et al.   <cit> . high resistance levels of h. pylori strains of biopsy samples taken from patients with peptic ulcer diseases against metronidazole , clarithromycin  and amoxicillin  was reported previously by bang et al.   <cit> . another iranian investigation  <cit>  showed that the prevalence of resistance in h. pylori strains of gastrointestinal disorders against metronidazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin had the ranges of  <dig> to  <dig> %. bahrami et al.   <cit>  reported that the high prevalence of water-borne h. pylori resistance against furazolidone , clarithromycin , amoxicillin , metronidazole  and tetracycline . considerable levels of resistance in h. pylori strains of clinical specimens against metronidazole, clarithromycin, quinolones, amoxicillin, and tetracycline have been reported from various countries such as nigeria, senegal, india, saudi-arabia, china, colombia, taiwan, brazil, thailand, argentina and egypt  <cit> .

the bottled mineral water samples of our study harbored h. pylori positive in genotypes of vaca, caga, cage, icea, oipa and baba <dig>  the most commonly detected genotypes were vacas1a , vacam1a , caga  and icea <dig> . low prevalence of oipa , baba <dig>  and cage  genotypes was also detected. the number of isolates which were positive for combined genotypes was also considerable. m1as1a , m1as <dig>  and m2s <dig>  and also s1a/caga+/icea2/oipa-/baba2-/cage-  were the most commonly detected combined genotypes. as it show, caga, oipa, baba <dig> and cage negative strains of h. pylori were more prevalent than their positive strains. the bottled mineral water samples weren’t harbored the caga, cage, baba <dig> and oipa positive strains of h. pylori. the number of icea <dig> strains was also low. in keeping with the uncertain cause of low distribution of caga, oipa, baba <dig> and cage genotypes in the h. pylori strains of bottled mineral water, high prevalence of pathogenic genotypes can guarantee the occurrence of gastrointestinal disorders due to consumption of h. pylori positive bottled mineral water samples of our study. the number of studies which were conducted on genotyping of h. pylori isolated from bottled mineral water are significantly low. in an only study which was conducted by yingzhi et al.   <cit> , high presence of vacas1a, vacam1a and vacas1am1a genotypes in the drinking water samples was reported. there were no additional previously published data in this field on drinking water but high presence of vacas1a, vacam1a, vacas <dig> alleles and also m1as1a, m1as <dig>  m1as1b, m1bs1b, m2s1a, m2s <dig> and m1am <dig> genotypes in the h. pylori strains of human clinical samples such as gastric biopsy, feces and saliva have been reported previously . sedaghat et al.   <cit>  reported that the prevalence of caga, icea <dig>  icea <dig>  oipa and baba <dig> genotypes in the cases of human clinical disorders including gastric ulcer and gastritis were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively which was similar to our finding in bottled mineral water. high potential of vaca positive strains of h. pylori for causing human clinical disorders has been reported previously . the severity of diseases caused by baba positive strains of h. pylori is higher than baba negative strains  <cit> . we found that  <dig> % of h. pylori strains recovered from the bottled mineral water samples harbored the baba genotype. the expression of icea <dig> is up-regulated on contact between h. pylori and human epithelial cells and may be related with peptic ulcer disease. we found that  <dig>  % of our strains were icea1 +. the expression of the oipa associated with il- <dig> induction and is related with severe clinical outcomes . prevalence of this genotype in the h. pylori strains of our investigation were  <dig> %.

CONCLUSIONS
to our best knowledge, the present investigation is the first prevalence report for presence of h. pylori in bottled mineral water as well as its genotyping and antimicrobial resistance properties all-around the world. bottled mineral water samples of iranian factories harbored virulent and resistant strains of h. pylori which shows an important public health problem. brand c, july month, resistance against ampicillin, s1a allele, m1as1a genotype and s1a/caga+/icea2/oipa-/baba2-/cage combined genotypes were the most commonly detected characters of h. pylori isolates of bottled mineral water samples of our study. cefsulodin and furazolidone prescription can be effective for treatment of cases of h. pylori.
