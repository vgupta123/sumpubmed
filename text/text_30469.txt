BACKGROUND
t lymphocytes are involved in various aspects of immune functions such as surveillance, inflammation and wound healing. these activities are dependent upon the chemotaxis of immune cells to sites of antigen deposition or inflammation  <cit> . lymphocyte chemotaxis involves an iterative series of coordinated molecular events including cell polarization, adhesion and force generation  <cit> . the molecular processes required for cell movement and recruitment are not fully understood. this derives in part from an incomplete knowledge of the cellular components that are required for chemotaxis. we performed a detailed mass spectrometry based compositional analysis of the isolated pseudopodia of migrating t lymphocytes as an approach to understanding the molecular basis for these processes. one of the components identified in pseudopodia was glia maturation factor γ  suggesting that it might play a role in the migration or chemotaxis of t lymphocytes. while the current studies were in progress it was reported that gmfg is required for the chemotaxis of human neutrophils  <cit> .

gmfg is a 17 kda protein which, contrary to the name, is not involved in the development of glia or the formation of gliomas  <cit> . rather it is highly expressed in the thymus, spleen, lung and in highly motile cell types such as lymphoblasts, t-lymphocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts  <cit> . gmfg has a high level of structural similarity with members of the adf  domain containing family suggesting that it might play a role in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . although an early study suggested that gmfg directly interacted with actin filaments  <cit> , subsequent reports using purified actin and a gmfg homolog from yeast have yielded conflicting results  <cit> . several groups have shown that gmfg and its homologs interact with purified arp2/ <dig> complex  <cit>  and interfere with arp2/ <dig> induced daughter filament growth. they also cause removal of actin branches from the parent actin filament . these observations suggested that gmfg may be involved in cell movement, possibly by defining the location of arp2/ <dig> dependent actin branching required for membrane extension or by providing a mechanism for the regeneration of the actin monomer pool required for continued cell pseudopodia extension.

the present study demonstrates that gmfg is required for the migration and chemotaxis of human t-lymphocytes. the loss of gmfg results in reduced cell migration which appears to be associated with altered integrin expression and increased cell adhesion. these results suggest that gmfg may be required for the proper control of cellular adhesion which is essential for cell movement.

RESULTS
gmfg is present in the pseudopodia of sdf <dig> treated t-lymphocytes
the intent of our studies was to examine the roles of proteins found in the pseudopodia of chemotactically stimulated lymphocytes. pseudopodia of sdf <dig> stimulated jurkat cells were isolated from the undersides of transwell insert membranes containing 3 μm pores. the pores prevented full transmigration but did permit pseudopodia extensions through the membrane pores. the proteins in the pseudopodia were subsequently identified by mass spectrometry.

glia maturation factor gamma was consistently identified by mass spectrometry in all of the pseudopodia isolates from sdf <dig> stimulated jurkat. the peptides that were identified for gmfg are listed in additional file  <dig>  however, gmfg was not detected when the same amount of protein from whole cell lysates was examined by mass spectrometry under identical conditions. clearly gmfg must be present in the lysates of cells that the pseudopodia were isolated from. however, the presence of gmfg was potentially masked by the presence of higher abundance proteins that were reduced in the pseudopodia preparations. a western blot based comparison of gmfg levels in pseudopodia and cell lysates, confirmed that gmfg was enriched ~ <dig> -fold in pseudopodia relative to whole cell lysates . immunofluorescence microscopy further demonstrated that gmfg was recruited to the leading edge of sdf <dig> stimulated il- <dig> dependent peripheral blood t-lymphocytes . however, gmfg was also detected throughout the cell body particularly in the region immediately behind the nuclei of migrating cells. similar distributions were also observed in migrating jurkat and ccrf-cem cells . these results indicated that a component of the total cellular gmfg pool was recruited to the leading edges of migrating t cells and enriched relative to the cell bodies.

gmfg is required for sdf <dig> induced t-lymphocyte chemotaxis
the accumulation of gmfg in the leading edge of the cell suggested that it could be involved in cell migration. the role of gmfg in these processes was examined using shrna to reduce gmfg protein expression levels. jurkat cells were transduced with one of three distinct shrna clones that targeted different regions of the gmfg sequence. western blot analysis of gmfg levels demonstrated that each of these clones caused a 65–76% reduction in gmfg levels relative to cells transduced with a non-silencing control vector . the control transductants had gmfg levels similar to those of wild type jurkat cells suggesting that the transduction process per se did not impact on the expression of this protein.

reduction of gmfg expression levels did not impact on cellular architecture or proliferation suggesting that it was not essential for these processes. however, the sdf <dig> induced chemotaxis of cells with reduced gmfg was inhibited by 69–95% compared with either non-silencing control transductants or untransduced jurkat cells .

the loss of chemotaxis could arise from changes in cellular motility or a failure of cells to respond to chemokine stimulation. the effects of gmfg knockdown  on migration rates were examined in il- <dig> dependent t cells. cell tracking plots clearly demonstrated the reduced motility of gmfg-kd cells in comparison to non-silencing controls . a closer inspection of the knockdown cells showed that they were able to polarize and extend pseudopodia. however, the knockdown cells were unable to fully detach from their initial positions and the observed pseudopodia were rapidly collapsed and formed at one or more new sites . this process was repeated continuously, with little or no net movement observed for the knockdown cells. quantitation of tracking data comparing knockdown cells to controls indicated a 58% decrease in median velocity, a 57% decrease in median accumulated distance and a 74% decrease in the median euclidean distance traveled . thus, the apparent accumulated distance traveled by these cells, was actually a measure of repeated extension and retraction of cellular processes from a fixed point. in reality there was no net movement. these observations raised the possibility that gmfg played a role in the regulation of cellular adherence.

the effects of gmfg loss on t cell adhesion and integrin expression
the relative levels of adhesion of gmfg-kd cells to fibronectin was  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold that of nonsilencing control cells . the increased adherence was observed in jurkat cells, ccrf-cem cells and il- <dig> dependent peripheral blood t-lymphocytes using two different gmfg shrna constructs for each cell line.

members of the β <dig> integrin family are the predominant mediators of lymphocyte cell adhesion to extracellular components such as fibronectin  <cit> . the surface expression of β <dig> integrin on gmfg-kd cells was increased by 61% compared with control cells . both α4β <dig> and α5β <dig> integrins have been shown to contribute to lymphocyte fibronectin binding. there was a 66% increase in α <dig> integrin levels in gmfg-kd cells. in contrast, the levels of the α <dig> subunit were unaffected in the gmfg-kd cells. these results indicated that the loss of gmfg was associated with altered β1and α <dig> expression levels and patterns.

the contributions of integrins to the adhesive changes were examined using adhesion blocking antibodies specific for the β <dig>  and α <dig>  subunits. treatment with 3s <dig> . in contrast jbs <dig> appeared to only inhibit the increased level of adhesion found in the gmfg-kd cells implying that the elevated adhesion of these cells to fibronectin was mediated by α5β <dig> 

the α5β <dig> integrin binds specifically to an rgd motif within fibronectin  <cit>  and this interaction can be inhibited with synthetic peptides containing the rgd sequence. the addition of rgd peptide to cell suspensions of a ccrf-cem gmfg-kd line reduced the fibronectin adhesion of these cells to levels comparable to those of control non-silencing cells . similar results were obtained for a jurkat gmfg-kd line . interestingly, rgd had no discernible effect on the binding of control cells to fibronectin. these data further support the conclusion that the increased adhesion of gmfg-kd cells is due to an increase in the levels of functional α5β <dig> integrin on the surface of these cells.

integrins have multiple conformations corresponding to different affinities  <cit> . changes to the activation state of α5β <dig> integrins could contribute to the observed increase in adhesion of the gmfg-kd lines. the huts- <dig> antibody is specific for the active conformation of β <dig> integrins  <cit> . flow cytometry analysis of gmfg-kd lines and controls using this antibody demonstrated an increase in the amount of active β <dig> integrin on the surface of gmfg-kd cells . these data demonstrated that increased α5β <dig> integrin was accompanied by an increase in the activation state of the β <dig> subunit suggesting that changes in the levels and activities of α5β <dig> are responsible for the increased adhesion of gmfg-kd cells to fibronectin.

gmfg loss is associated with altered β <dig> integrin distribution
the distribution of β <dig> integrins on non-silencing and gmfg-kd cells was examined by confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. fluorescence intensity plots were constructed along lines drawn through the central polarized axis of t-cells . the distributions of the β <dig> integrins along these axes were then categorized as either tail biased, unbiased or front biased. sixty cells from each cell line were processed in this fashion as a sampling of the overall distribution of β <dig> integrins. line plots from three representative cells from each category were overlaid to produce the graphs shown in figure 6a, along with a single cell image to illustrate the staining patterns. gmfg-kd cells predominantly displayed a tail bias  while only 22% of control cells fell into this category . the knockdown cells were rarely observed to have a front bias , while the control cells were evenly split between front biased and unbiased .

gmfg loss leads to increased β <dig> integrin expression and adhesion to icam-1
analysis of lfa- <dig>  surface expression on gmfg-kd cells revealed a modest but consistent increase . the increase ranged from  <dig> to 61% above that of controls in both the knockdown lines examined. similar results were seen with both ccrf-cem and jurkat cells . this increased surface expression of lfa- <dig> correlated with an enhanced adherence of these cells to icam- <dig> relative to non-silencing control cells . the two knockdown lines tested showed statistically significant increases  in adhesion by 43% and 85% .

discussion
the present study demonstrated that gmfg is enriched in the pseudopodia of migrating human t lymphocytes. interference with gmfg expression markedly inhibited sdf <dig> stimulated chemotaxis. this effect was associated with reduced migration and a failure to sustain cellular polarity and directed movement. the inability of the cells to move was associated with an increase in total β <dig> integrin levels which included elevated expression levels of the high-affinity conformation of the β <dig> subunit. these changes and the increased adhesion of gmfg-kd cells to fibronectin appeared to be predominantly related to increased α5β <dig> levels. this was further supported by the fact that a synthetic rgd containing peptide and inhibitory antibodies specific for the α <dig> and β <dig> subunits reduced the elevated adhesion of the gmfg-kd lines to levels comparable with control cells. the loss of gmfg also seems to impact on the distribution of integrin molecules, as there is a propensity for gmfg-kd cells to accumulate β <dig> integrins within the uropod. this accumulation, in combination with increased surface expression levels, was consistent with failure of the cells to detach from the substrate. furthermore the changes in integrin levels and activity were not restricted to the α5β <dig> integrin suggesting that gmfg activity plays a broader role in control of cellular adhesion.

gmfg is a member of the actin-depolymerizing factor homology  family with actin depolymerizing activity  <cit> . recent studies indicate that gmfg mediated depolymerization differs from that of other adf-h members such as cofilin  <cit> . gmfg does not bind directly to actin, rather it interacts with arp2/ <dig> complex members which can induce debranching of actin filaments. interestingly, while gmfg reduces the rate of actin filament assembly, the distribution and absolute amount of f-actin ultimately produced during in vitro assays is unaltered in the absence of gmfg . these observations raise the possibility that gmfg may be required for the transition from branched actin networks at the leading edge to more filamentous structures that are at immediately proximal to the leading edge of migrating cells. these filaments may provide the cytoskeletal architecture for interaction with integrins through integrin associated actin binding proteins. such interactions could also regulate integrin activation and distribution to generate the adhesion required for cell movement.

several gmfg interaction partners have been identified to date. gmfg was identified in immunoprecipitates of arp2/ <dig> complexes in hela cells that were overexpressing gmfg  <cit> . subsequently, several groups confirmed the interaction of murine, yeast or dictyostelium gmfs and the arp2/ <dig> complex using purified proteins  <cit> . wave <dig> was also co-precipitated with myc tagged gmfg in dhl <dig>  <cit> . however it is unclear if the latter interaction relates to cell motility rather than chemotaxis as these results were obtained with cells that had not been treated with exogenous chemokine.

the present studies demonstrated a role for gmfg in the control of t cell adhesion and its subsequent effects on cell migration in stably transduced lymphocyte lines and short term il <dig> dependent peripheral blood t cells. the loss of gmfg has also been shown to decrease the chemotactic responses of both pmn and differentiated hl <dig> cells  <cit> . the phosphorylation levels of p <dig> activated kinases  and p <dig> mapk were also found to be decreased following fmlf or cxcl <dig> stimulation of dhl <dig> cells. pak1/ <dig> plays multiple roles in the regional regulation of actin dynamics and myosin function  <cit> . the strength of focal adhesions can be regulated by pak1/ <dig> activity as inhibition of either the activity or expression of pak1/ <dig> results in increased numbers of nascent long lived adhesions. the net effect of these alterations is a reduction in cellular migration. additionally, the conformation of α5β <dig> integrin is known to switch from low to high affinity in focal adhesions  <cit> . hence the increased proportion of activated β <dig> integrin observed on gmfg-kd cells would be consistent with a pak1/ <dig> mediated increase in the number of focal adhesions. an intriguing possibility is that gmfg alters cytoskeletal organization which impacts on the frequency and properties of integrin contacts with the extracellular matrix. the strength of α5β <dig> binding can be enhanced by cytoskeletal tension forces generated by myosin ii  <cit> , and it is conceivable that gmfg could be involved in the regulation of force generation by its effects on the cytoskeleton. the observed changes in the integrin expression patterns and activity may be a reflection of architectural changes that accompany the shifts in motility induced by gmfg loss. these are points for future examination which could provide new insights as to the regulation of lymphocyte adhesion.

CONCLUSIONS
gmfg is required for lymphocyte migration. the loss of gmfg results in the selective increase of integrin expression, leading to altered uropod retraction and reduced persistence of leading edge protrusions. these changes could be a result of either the direct actions of gmfg on integrin properties or an indirect consequence of possible alterations in cytoskeletal dynamics associated with gmfg loss. it is unclear if the effects of gmfg loss on chemotaxis derive from the inability of cells lacking this protein to respond to chemotactic stimuli or their failure to sustain the directionality required for chemotaxis. collectively this data suggests that gmfg plays an essential role in the regulation of lymphocyte movement.
