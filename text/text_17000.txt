BACKGROUND
in the past, pseudogenes were generally regarded as functionally inert, due to the presence of several disabling features that prevent their expression , and therefore their evolution has been considered to be neutral  <cit> . however, this view has been challenged by new evidences, which demonstrate that certain pseudogenes are functionally active  <cit> . the gencode, a sub-project of the encode , has estimated the number of pseudogenes in the human genome to be near  <dig>   <cit> . from these, ~6% were identified has potentially transcribed by computational models and almost half of them validated by rt-pcr-seq techniques  <cit> . indeed, pseudogenes can be functional at the dna, rna or protein levels and have a function related or independent of the parental gene  <cit> . at the dna level, pseudogenes can regulate other genes by pseudogene insertion in the non-coding or coding region of the target gene and regulate the parental counterpart gene by gene conversion, homologous recombination and through regulatory sequences  <cit> . concerning the rna level, pseudogene rnas can compete with the parental mrna for mirnas, rna binding proteins and/or translational machinery binding, as well as, functioning as sirnas and thereby inhibiting the parental gene expression. pseudogenes can also function in unrelated genes as long non-coding rnas, by encoding mirna precursors or even compete for mirnas  <cit> . at the protein level, pseudogenic proteins can have the same activity of the parental protein but function in different tissues, subcellular localization and/or pathophysiological conditions  <cit> . pseudogenic proteins with altered functions might also affect the activity of the parental ones  <cit> . if a pseudogene mrna is translated to a functional pseudogenic protein, this gene is often called a retrogene  <cit> . pseudogenes can also produce truncated proteins that can function as antigenic peptides in the surface of the cells to stimulate the immune system against the malignant cells  <cit> . pseudogenes have already been associated with several pathological conditions such as cancer  <cit> , diabetes  <cit>  and neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

one promising model to understand the functional relevance of pseudogenization is the protein phosphatase  <dig> regulatory subunit  <dig> . this protein, also known as inhibitor- <dig> , was one of the first regulatory subunits identified as an inhibitor and binding partner of the ser/thr phosphoprotein phosphatase  <dig> . ppp1r <dig> forms a stable complex with ppp <dig> catalytic subunit  blocking the active site and inhibiting it potently, being the reactivation triggered by phosphorylation  <cit> . the ppp1c/ppp1r <dig> complex has been implied in several processes such as cardiac function  <cit> , mitosis and meiosis  <cit> , tubulin acetylation and neuronal cell survival  <cit> . also, it has been previously shown that a ppp1cc2/ppp1r2-like complex is important in the acquisition of sperm motility  <cit> .

the ppp1r <dig> gene is conserved throughout all eukaryotes, from yeast to humans, with homologues found even in plants  <cit> . in the human genome, as observed for other ancient ppp <dig> inhibitors such as ppp1r <dig>  and ppp1r <dig> , several sequences have been identified that are highly similar to ppp1r <dig>  <cit> . for ppp1r <dig>  nine loci were found that present hallmark features of processed pseudogenes. these related sequences were collectively named ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes and were numbered from  <dig> to  <dig>   <cit> . these pseudogenes are found scattered in the genome due to random retrotransposition phenomena that consist on the reverse transcription of cellular rnas and random insertion into the nuclear genome  <cit> . past studies identified four ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes at the messenger rna level using high throughput techniques. ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> were discovered in human  <cit> , ppp1r2p <dig> in human and crab-eating macaque  and ppp1r2p <dig>  was found in human and mouse   <cit> .

in this work we performed an exhaustive search for ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes in publicly available mammalian genome databases in order to infer their evolutionary history. in the collected pseudogenes, an assay for detection of the proteins was conducted. our results show that evolution and pseudogenization of ppp1r <dig> gene may be correlated with the formation of new genes and the gain of new specific functions.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> sequences were retrieved from the ncbi and ensembl databases by blasting against the human ppp1r <dig> mrna sequence. ten pseudogenes were obtained from human sequences, increasing by one the previous number reported in the literature  <cit> . all pseudogenes obtained are intronless and with a truncated 5’utr meaning that are processed pseudogenes. the parental human ppp1r <dig> cds  covers 17% of the entire mrna ; even the pseudogenes with the lowest coverage contain the parental cds, with the exception of ppp1r2p <dig> that only comprises part of the 3’utr.

phylogenetic analysis
in order to increase the reliability of the alignment for the phylogenetic reconstruction, we selected sequences with >85% coverage and >60% similarity with the human ppp1r <dig> cds. by doing this,  <dig> sequences were included in the tree that represented all the pseudogenes with the exception of ppp1r2p <dig> . the unused sequences encompassed pseudogenic fragments and sequences where identity with ppp1r <dig> was detected mostly outside the cds  or presented truncated cds .

from the ml tree, four major clusters can be distinguished, generally supported by high bootstrap values . one of the clusters includes most mammalian ppp1r <dig> sequences, the exceptions being primates ppp1r <dig>  glires ppp1r <dig>  ppp1r2-like sequences , and the elephant ppp1r <dig> . the other cluster comprises ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p8-like primate sequences. mammalian ppp1r2p <dig> sequences compose a third cluster and a fourth cluster includes all ppp1r <dig> and related pseudogene sequences from primates . these sequences are clustered with the glires ppp1r <dig> sequences. ppp1r <dig> is also present in the gray short-tailed opossum  which is consistent with the presence of ppp1r <dig> in eukaryotes, being indeed an ancient and well conserved gene  <cit> .

two major retroposition events can be inferred, the retroposition that originated ppp1r2p <dig> and the retroposition that gave origin to ppp1r2p1/p2/p3/p4/p5/p6/p <dig> . retroposition of ppp1r2p <dig> occurred before the split of eutheria  from metatheria  at ~ <dig> - <dig>  millions of years ago , as suggested by the presence of this pseudogene in the marsupial gray short-tailed opossum and in all other mammals, making ppp1r2p <dig> the most ancient pseudogene still present in humans . in the x chromosome we found, close to ppp1r2p <dig>  more ppp1r2-like copies that seem to have arisen by ppp1r <dig> gene duplication: marmoset , rat , mouse  and pig . the phylogenetic analysis shows that these copies are related to parental ppp1r <dig> gene suggesting that this gene has been retroposed to the x chromosome more than once independently and at different time points in these species. we checked for gene conversion events and we did not find any evidence for it. in the phylogenetic tree the ppp1r2p <dig> genes are clearly apart of these ppp1r2-like that are clustered in the ppp1r <dig> gene group. ppp1r2p <dig> is also non-primate specific. indeed, ppp1r2p <dig> was present in all mammalian orders included in this study, with the exception of glires and opossum, suggesting that it was originated ~ <dig> - <dig>  mya . retroposition of ppp1r2p1/p2/p3/p4/p5/p6/p <dig> is more recent and occurred in the ancestor of primates and during primates’ evolution since these pseudogenes occur only in primate species . other retroposition events of ppp1r <dig> gene have also occurred in some mammals  and appear to be species-specific events since these fragments are not widespread in mammals and both copies present in each species cluster together. clustering of glires ppp1r <dig> and r2-like pseudogenes along with ppp1r2p1/p2/p3/p5/p6/p10/p <dig> from primates is consistent with the grouping of these species within the euarchontoglires  superorder  <cit> . ppp1r2p <dig> was originated before the separation of new world monkeys  and catarrhini that occurred  <dig> - <dig>  mya . a 70 bp deletion seems to have occurred in hominidae after the divergence from hylobatidae, ~ <dig>  mya. also, an alu repeat was inserted after the radiation of the hominoidea, ~ <dig>  mya, in the middle of the sequence disrupting it, but without affecting the open reading frame  . interestingly, in chimpanzee, ppp1r2p <dig> suffered a recent duplication event that gave rise to a second locus separated by two alu repeats flanking a line <dig>  element . concerning ppp1r2p <dig>  we found that it clusters along with primates’ ppp1r <dig> suggesting that this is the most recent retroposed pseudogene originated after the separation of hominoidea from cercopithecoidea , ~ <dig> - <dig>  mya, since no copy was found in rhesus monkey and marmoset . clustering of ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p10/p <dig> might indicate that these pseudogenes arose by duplication. our analysis shows that ppp1r2p <dig> is the ancestral, being originated before the division of platyrrhini and catarrhini , while ppp1r2p <dig> is a duplication that occurred only in humans, being therefore a duplicated pseudogene . also, in orangutan, a duplication occurred very close to ppp1r2p <dig>  that is not related with human ppp1r2p <dig>  and was hence here named ppp1r2p10-like . the other pseudogenes  were originated at the same time as ppp1r2p <dig> . ppp1r2p <dig> was originated in catarrhini after its separation from the platyrrhini ~ <dig> - <dig>  mya . the ppp1r2p <dig>  and ppp1r2p <dig>  sequences were not retrieved from the databases, which suggest the later deletion of these pseudogenes . the fact that some genome annotations are early assemblies, might explain the missing of these and other sequences. however, the good quality of glires  genome assemblies reinforces the absence of ppp1r2p <dig> sequence and suggests that it occurred in the common ancestor. the absence of gibbon ppp1r2p <dig> sequence could also be explained by the several insertions present, similar to what happens in other species, virtually dismantling it and making the retrieval impossible . moreover, the conserved linkage confirms the results of the phylogenetic analysis, being all pseudogenes flanked by the same respective genes in all species analyzed .

evidences for functionality of ppp1r2-related pseudogenes
features such as the existence of transcriptional related data, presence of regulatory elements, mrna stability , translation initiator sequence and complete orfs  are indicators of the putative functionality of genes. a search for such features was conducted in order to verify the potential functionality of the ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes.

ppp1r2p1
the gene expression omnibus  and gene expression atlas  public repositories contain expression data for ppp1r2p <dig>  the presence of promoters, enhancers and other regulatory elements could be an explanation for ppp1r2p <dig> transcriptional related data , although basal transcription should not be set aside. concerning the mrna stability, only part of the 5’utr , due to the low processivity of the reverse transcriptase, and part of the 3’utr  are present. therefore, the stability might be compromised although a polya signal  is present near the 3’utr terminus . regarding the translation, the kozak sequence, important for translation initiation, is present in the parental gene and is conserved in ppp1r2p <dig>  altogether, these results suggest that at least in humans, ppp1r2p <dig> is expressed and might be functionally relevant. although we cannot set aside the low quality of some of the assembled genomes, in other primates the orf of ppp1r2p <dig> has frameshift disruptions that introduce premature stop codons, indicating that in these species might not produce a putative functional protein, or if so the protein might be truncated.

ppp1r2p3
the sequence of ppp1r2p <dig> is complete, without any frameshifts or element repeats disruptions . the sequence was truncated at the 5’utr, as expected due to the low processivity of the reverse transcriptase, and in the 3’utr it lost two of the four polya signals that may lead to a short ~1500-1600 nt message. we have previously found, by a yeast two hybrid screening of human testis cdna, using as bait ppp1cc <dig>  one clone assigned to ppp1r2p <dig>  <cit> . a search for ppp1r2p <dig> ests in databases revealed that this is one of the most represented ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes , being highly detected in testis . together with our previous data, this strongly suggests that this pseudogene is transcribed. two independent reports using mass spectrometry have also assigned peptides to ppp1r2p <dig>  <cit> . however, these peptides share the sequence with both parental gene and ppp1r2p <dig>  being most probably misassigned. nonetheless, we have shown recently by mass spectrometry the presence of ppp1r2p <dig> in human sperm samples  <cit> .

ppp1r2p9
the ppp1r2p <dig> sequences retrieved have not been disrupted, at least in primates . however, the 5’utr of the parental gene is absent and the 3’utr is truncated . at the 3’utr there is a single polya signal at nucleotide position  <dig>  according to the human sequence, which suggests that a shorter message is produced. sequence repeats, deletions, unknown and known sequence insertions were only found in the ppp1r2-like sequences . the only exceptions are in mouse and rat where the 3’utr was deleted in the parental ppp1r2p <dig> .

this pseudogene is the one with more transcriptional related data  and has many ests in testis  like ppp1r2p <dig>  ppp1r2p <dig> was originally found in cdna libraries of human germ cell tumors, binding to ppp1c directly and in heat stable extracts inhibits this phosphatase potently with an ic <dig> of  <dig> nm  <cit> . also, we have recently identified ppp1r2p <dig> as an interacting partner of ppp1ca by yeast-two hybrid in human brain  <cit> . this suggests that silent regulatory areas are present in the region were ppp1r2p <dig> was retroposed and that during the evolution ppp1r2p <dig> might have retained or gained the capacity to be transcribed. in spite of this, there is no data suggesting the translation of ppp1r2p <dig>  considering the orf, all species show a continuous orf with no or small truncations at the c-terminus , with the exception of pig where no protein translation was obtained from the orf.

evidences of non-coding nature of ppp1r2-related pseudogenes
considering the other pseudogenes sequences, many insertions in ppp1r2p <dig> lead to a completely disrupted orf and missense mutations in ppp1r2p4/p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> lead to premature stop codons . also, since these pseudogenes showed low coverage to the parental gene, most of the 3’utr is missing and so, regulatory elements such as polyadenylation signals that are important for the transcript cleavage and stability are absent. this indicates that no transcription or translation should be expected from these pseudogenes, which corroborates with the fact that no expression was found in ests and high-throughput databases with the exception of ppp1r2p <dig>  considering the pseudogenes with the highest coverage in relation to the parental gene, ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  no orf disruptions were found but many missense mutations were found in all species analyzed that lead to premature stop codons . all four polyadenylation signals present in the parental ppp1r <dig> mrna are conserved in ppp1r2p <dig>  although protein expression is unlikely, ppp1r2p <dig> message was found by qpcr in human testis but not in peripheral blood leukocytes  <cit> . also, two experiments from arrayexpress, report the up/down regulation of this pseudogene in prostate adenocarcinoma and in a prostate transcriptomic study performed in a caucasian population  <cit> . these results might be artifacts or could be due to other ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes/parental gene since this pseudogene is located in chromosome  <dig> that has low density , and as expected, the processed pseudogene density is also low,  <dig>  <cit> , making the transcription highly unlikely.

detection of ppp1r2-related proteins
ppp1r <dig> forms a stable and high affinity complex with ppp1c by blocking the active site. the reactivation of the complex is triggered by phosphorylation at thr <dig> of ppp1r <dig> through several kinases, including glycogen synthase  <dig>   <cit> . ppp1r <dig> is also phosphorylated at the residue ser <dig> by casein kinase  <dig>  that accelerates the subsequent phosphorylation at thr <dig> by gsk <dig>  <cit> . the comparison of human ppp1r2p <dig>  ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> with ppp1r <dig> amino acid sequences  shows that ppp1r2p <dig> is the most divergent  and ppp1r2p <dig> the most similar . regarding the ppp <dig> binding motifs, silk and ksqkw, they are conserved in all ppp1r2-related proteins, and klhy is conserved in ppp1r2p <dig> but a substitution of the first residue to thr or arg is observed for ppp1r2p <dig> or ppp1r2p <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the c-terminal acidic stretch  required for gsk <dig> phosphorylation  <cit>  is maintained in ppp1r2p <dig> although the gsk <dig> phosphorylation site thr <dig> is substituted to pro. the other two pseudogenes maintain the gsk <dig> phosphorylation site but the acidic stretch has several changes particularly in ppp1r2p <dig> . finally, the ck <dig> phosphorylation site ser <dig> is conserved in ppp1r2p <dig> but is substituted by an arg in ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  overall, the analysis shows that these ppp1r2-related proteins should maintain the ability to bind to ppp1c, as was already demonstrated for ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  <cit> , and the ability to regulate the holoenzyme activity by gsk <dig> phosphorylation is compromised in ppp1r2p <dig>  <cit> , and may also be but in a lesser extent in ppp1r2p <dig>  due to the change ser <dig> to arg.

ppp1cc <dig> is a sperm-specific protein phosphatase involved in spermatogenesis and sperm motility  <cit> . its inhibition in vivo, was associated with a ppp1r2-like activity since gsk <dig> was able to reverse the process  <cit> . recently, a report identified the ppp1r <dig> protein in heat-stable extracts of bull testis and mouse testis and sperm where it may account for this ppp1r2-like activity  <cit> . it is well known that testis is one of the organs where most pseudogenes are expressed and their gene products were shown to have important roles in spermatogenesis and other germ cell related functions  <cit> . this might be due, in part, to the hyper-transcription state of the autosomal chromosomes in the meiotic and post-meiotic germ cells due to chromatin modifications  <cit> . a recent study done by gencode has revealed that 64% of all validated expressed pseudogenes are expressed in testis  <cit> . ppp1r <dig> is one of the ppp1c regulators with more related pseudogenes  <cit> . we have previously identified ppp1r2p <dig> message and protein, in testis  <cit> . we hypothesized that from the other pseudogenes, only ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> are capable of being also translated. in fact, the two pseudogenes, ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig>  were present in the mass spectrometry data obtained from a human sperm immunoprecipitation .

peptides were identified by orbitrap velos mass spectrometry, from human sperm heat stable extracts and immunoprecipitates using rabbit anti-ppp1r <dig> antibodies. aa, amino acids; pi, isoelectric point.

this analysis was based on the fact that the molecular weight of these ppp1r2-related proteins should be similar to the parental one , being therefore present in the same region where the band was extracted to mass spectrometry analysis. the antibody used to immunoprecipitate ppp1r2-related proteins was raised against a peptide containing amino acid residues 134– <dig> from the mouse ppp1r <dig> sequence . this antibody was used previously to detect ppp1r <dig>  <cit> . in the 14-residue region, ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> have two and three substitutions respectively, when comparing to ppp1r <dig> sequence. we predicted that using this antibody, we were also able to detect the other ppp1r2-related proteins. mass spectrometry data identified  <dig> msms  spectra corresponding to  <dig> different peptides matching unequivocally to ppp1r2p <dig>  and  <dig> msms spectra corresponding to one peptide matching unequivocally to ppp1r2p <dig>  <cit> .

the sequence coverage obtained for ppp1r2p <dig> was  <dig> % and the mascot score levels were  <dig>  . this is the first time that ppp1r2p <dig> protein is detected, being clearly recovered from human ejaculated sperm. additionally, these results also indicate that native ppp1r2-related proteins are indeed heat stable and migrate at the same position as the parental ppp1r <dig>  lastly, no peptides were recovered for ppp1r2p <dig> using this method, which might suggest the absence of the protein, at least from the sperm cells.

signatures of selection
pseudogenes have been regarded as being derived from functional-encoding genomic dna sequences that have accumulated disabling mutations  that make them non-coding protein genes. this lack of function predicts that pseudogenes are not under selective pressures and thus evolve neutrally . nevertheless, this view keeps being challenged by the accumulation of examples of transcribed pseudogenes with several acknowledged functions   <cit> . signatures of selection, in addition to sequence conservation, have been considered as obvious indicators of the functional importance of pseudogenes  <cit> .

here, by using six ml methods, signatures of both positive and negative selection were detected in the ppp1r2p <dig> pseudogene, as well as in the parental gene ppp1r <dig> . signatures of negative selection were far more evident than those of positive selection, for both genes. four methods, rel, fel, slac and fubar, showed sites negatively selected, with most being detected by more than one method. signatures of positive selection were principally detected by fel and meme methods. the codons  <dig> and  <dig>  for ppp1r <dig>  and the codons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  for ppp1r2p <dig>  were detected by at least two separate methods. no detection was obtained for the paml method. it is known that sperm-expressed genes present in chromosome x tend to be positively selected when compared with x-linked non-sperm genes and with sperm-expressed autosomal genes  <cit> . this evolutionary pressure is due to their hemizigous expression in males that will favor advantageous mutations and remove any deleterious one. ppp1r2p <dig> is not evolving neutrally and may thus be expressed, further supporting a functional role for this pseudogene.

CONCLUSIONS
retropositions from the ppp1r <dig> gene are ancient, prior to the great radiation of the mammals, as supported by the presence of ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> in the different groups of mammals. all the other pseudogenes found in humans are primate-specific and were retroposed at different times during the evolution of this group. for instance, ppp1r2p <dig> exists only in the members of the hominoidea family, whereas ppp1r2p <dig>  the most distinct, is present in all groups and was retroposed ~ <dig> - <dig>  mya. this reveals that retropositions have occurred in waves and in a unique way similar to the alu repeats explosion that occurred ~40- <dig> mya, after the divergence of simian ancestors from the prosimians . the recent pseudogene duplication in humans, ppp1r2p <dig>  and in chimpanzee, ppp1r2p <dig>  suggests that evolution of pseudogenes is still an active process.

as suggested by the presence of an uninterrupted orf, ests and polya signals, ppp1r2p <dig>  appears to be transcribed. moreover, the finding of positive and negative selection signatures suggests that it could be functionally relevant. indeed, we confirmed that two ppp1r2-related proteins are translated in human sperm , and are heat stable in their native form  <cit> . the importance of these ppp1r2-related proteins in physiological conditions, such as spermatogenesis and sperm physiology, should be assessed in future studies. besides this, ppp1r2p <dig>  ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> were found to be associated with pathological conditions  <cit> . thus, assessing their ratios may be considered as a diagnostic tool in the future.

furthermore, it has been shown that pseudogenes can regulate their parental counterparts at the rna level either by sirna or by competition for positive and negative stabilizing factors and mirnas  <cit> . although ppp1r2p <dig>  ppp1r2p <dig> and ppp1r2p <dig> translation is very unlikely, their expression is documented and so, it is feasible these pseudogenes could regulate the parental ppp1r <dig> message levels and therefore its function.

these observations indicate that ppp1r <dig> pseudogenes have possible biological functions rather than acting as non-functional relics as initially believed. their evolution process might be in part related with the formation of new genes and the gain of new specific functions. therefore, their designation as pseudogenes should be reevaluated.
