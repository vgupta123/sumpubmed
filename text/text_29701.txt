BACKGROUND
hsfa <dig> is the sole plant hsf that has been found to be seed-specific  <cit> . gain of function as a consequence of overexpression of hahsfa <dig> in seeds showed the involvement of this transcription factor in basal thermotolerance and longevity. the transgenic seeds survive exposure to lethal temperatures after seed imbibition, without a previous, heat-acclimation treatment. the hahsfa <dig> seeds also resist controlled deterioration procedures for rapid aging  <cit> . more recently, we have shown that ectopic overexpression of hahsfa <dig> conferred dramatic resistance of vegetative tissues from young seedlings to severe dehydration, which was quantified as water loss of up to 98% of total water content  <cit> . in both cases hahsfa <dig> activated a genetic program that includes subsets of hsps normally expressed during zygotic embryogenesis in seeds; this program does not include late embryogenesis abundant  proteins. furthermore, hahsfa <dig> did not affect the accumulation of sucrose and raffinose oligosaccharides which, like lea proteins might be also involved in seed longevity and desiccation tolerance .

our laboratory has been interested for a long time in the identification of additional transcription factors involved in controlling the "seed hsp program". hahsfa <dig> and orthologous plant hsfs might be master regulators of such a program; our earlier work indicated that hahsfa <dig> could be used to obtain partially improved phenotypes without producing any negative effects on plant growth, morphology or development, at least under laboratory conditions. among candidate regulatory factors is hadreb <dig>  which is expressed in immature embryos and was cloned by cis-element interaction screening. hadreb <dig> belongs to the dreb a <dig> subgroup of proteins that interact with drought-responsive element  sequences found in plant promoters  <cit> . dreb <dig> proteins are involved in the response and acclimation to dehydration and to high-temperature stress, whereas related dreb <dig> proteins are induced by cold. the dreb <dig> and dreb <dig> transcription factors and related ap <dig>  erf, and rav <dig> groups belong to the apetala2/ethylene-responsive element binding protein  family, which contains a total of  <dig> members in arabidopsis  <cit> . we showed that hadreb <dig> interacted with dre sequences in the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter and that this interaction was required for synergistic transcriptional activation of hahsp <dig> g <dig> by hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in sunflower embryos  <cit> . we also pointed out sequence similarities and differences between hadreb <dig> and other dreb <dig> factors in arabidopsis and other plants. these differences might indicate the functional divergence of hadreb <dig> from atdreb2a. thus, the most overall similar factor in arabidopsis, atdreb2a, appeared to differ from hadreb <dig> in sequences conserved in dreb <dig> factors such as crorca <dig>  from catharanthus roseus, a plant species that is closer to sunflower than arabidopsis. such sequences included the carboxyl terminal region, which is possibly involved in transcriptional activation  <cit> .

very few plant dreb <dig> factors have been functionally characterized. in arabidopsis for example, overexpression of atdreb2c enhanced basal thermotolerance in vegetative tissues without causing negative effects on plant growth  <cit> . similarly, a wheat dreb <dig> factor improved freezing and osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco, although some lines showed delayed germination  <cit> . the constitutive or stress-inducible expression of the maize zmdreb2a factor in arabidopsis plants improved their drought stress tolerance and basal thermotolerance. in this case the transgenic plants showed delayed bolting and reduced growth of rosette leaves  <cit> . in contrast with the above results, the overexpression of atdreb2a or rice osdreb2a factor in arabidopsis was not sufficient for observing stress-tolerant phenotypes, but nor did it impair plant growth or development  <cit> . these dreb <dig> proteins could be unstable and/or have little transcriptional activity. both proteins could require post-translational modification that stabilize and activate them in the nucleus. atdreb2a has been the most functionally analyzed of the plant dreb <dig> factors. recent work identified e <dig> ubiquitin ligases named drip <dig> and drip <dig>  which interact with and mediate atdreb2a ubiquitination. the overexpression of drip <dig> and drip <dig> delayed the drought-stress response that is regulated by atdreb2a  <cit> . internal deletion of amino acids  <dig> to  <dig> transformed atdreb2a into atdreb2a ca, a constitutively active and stabilized form in the nucleus. that form, when overexpressed induced significant tolerance to drought stress  <cit> . in addition, atdreb2a ca induced not only drought-responsive genes but also heat-shock-related genes; basal thermotolerance was increased in plants overexpressing atdreb2a ca and decreased in atdreb2a knockout plants  <cit> . atdreb2a was shown to be induced by heat stress, and in turn specifically induced transcription of athsfa <dig>  one of the  <dig> different hsfs in arabidopsis. the atdreb2a-mediated athsfa <dig> induction regulates the expression of heat-shock related genes involved in the observed thermotolerant phenotypes  <cit> . recent analyses of genetic responses involved in plant acclimation to high temperature pointed to an additional dreb <dig> factor. atdreb2b, together with athsfa <dig>  are the only two transcription factors among the genes that were specifically induced in thermotolerant lines of arabidopsis. moreover, it appears that atdreb2a and atdreb2b could have some functional redundancy in thermotolerance, as mutants for either factor did not show a defect in heat acclimation  <cit> ; dreb2a- <dig> mutant arabidopsis plants, however, showed reduced basal thermotolerance when directly treated at 46°c for  <dig> min  <cit> .

here we report the results of a functional analysis of hadreb <dig> in transgenic tobacco and point to clear differences with other functionally characterized dreb <dig> transcription factors. we overexpressed hadreb <dig> using cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter and enhancer sequences. we could easily detect accumulation of the hadreb <dig> protein in vegetative tissues; however, hadreb <dig> did not induce heat-shock protein genes, as cytosolic shsps  or hsp <dig> or increase basal thermotolerance. we also overexpressed hadreb <dig> under the seed-specific ds <dig> gene regulatory sequences . in this case, gain-of-function phenotypes were observed, but only after the conjoint overexpression in seeds of hahsfa <dig> and hadreb <dig>  the phenotypes included enhancement of the accumulation of shsps , of basal thermotolerance, and increased resistance to artificial aging. the strict dependence on a seed-specific hsf of the effects of hadreb <dig> characterize the latter as a distinct dreb <dig> factor with unique properties and functions that are restricted to seed development. the conjoint overexpression of hahsfa <dig> and hadreb <dig> in vegetative tissues did not further enhance the ectopic accumulation of seed shsps  that is induced by hahsfa <dig>  tolerance to severe dehydration is not increased beyond that observed upon constitutive overexpression of hahsfa <dig> alone  <cit> . we discuss how the novel observations reported here would: a. – allow the functional assignment of hadreb <dig> and of similar plant dreb <dig> factors; b. – indicate additional complexity in the transcriptional control of the hsfa <dig> program ; c. – improve the genetic modifications of seed longevity based on hsfa <dig> overexpression.

RESULTS
constitutive overexpression of hadreb2: lack of effect on vegetative thermotolerance
based on previous results showing that at least some plant dreb <dig> proteins enhance vegetative thermotolerance , we tested the overexpression of hadreb <dig> under camv35s sequences in transgenic tobacco, in 35s:dr <dig> plants. basal thermotolerance and the accumulation of different hsps at normal growth temperature  were analyzed in various 35s:dr <dig> lines. each 35s:dr <dig> line carries a different, single integration of the camv35s: hadreb <dig> transgene in heterozygosis. representative results of these experiments are depicted in figure  <dig>  all seedlings from the 35s:dr <dig> lines died after exposure to a temperature of 48°c for  <dig>  h. in contrast, seedlings from the same lines resisted the treatment at 48°c only if heat-acclimated by a previous treatment at a sub-lethal temperature . similar results were obtained with control, non-transgenic seedlings. in addition, 35s:a <dig> plants survived the 48°c treatment without previous heat acclimation . this result, as previously reported  <cit> , provided a positive control for partial, basal thermotolerance.

a hemaglutinin  tag fused to hadreb <dig> allowed us to determine whether protein stability is high enough for hadreb <dig> to accumulate in transgenic tobacco. the tagged hadreb <dig> could be readily detected to accumulate in the 35s:dr <dig> seedlings. in contrast, we could not detect accumulation of ci or cii shsps, nor of hsp <dig>  in unstressed 35s:dr <dig> seedlings . in summary, the hadreb <dig> protein was stable enough to accumulate in transgenic tobacco seedlings; however, hadreb <dig> overexpression did not modify basal or acquired thermotolerance or induce hsps at normal growth temperatures. these findings contrast with previous results obtained with other dreb <dig> transcription factors .

seed-specific overexpression of hadreb2: no effect on basal thermotolerance
we also tested, in ds10:dr <dig> plants, overexpression of hadreb <dig> under the ds <dig> sequences previously used to confer the very efficient seed-specific expression of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . we analyzed various ds10:dr <dig> lines for persistence of basal thermotolerance after controlled seed imbibition. basal thermotolerance assays  were thus performed  <cit>  with seeds from different ds10:dr <dig> lines, each one with a single transgenic integration event in heterozygosis. no effects on basal thermotolerance were observed in eight ds10:dr <dig> lines studied. the ds10:dr <dig> transgene was linked to a marker for hygromycin resistance . mendelian analyses were performed and the observed segregation ratios were evaluated by statistical analyses. antibiotic resistance segregated at the expected 3: <dig> ratio both before and after the bta . this indicates that, after exposure for  <dig> h to 50°c, there was no difference in survival between segregating transgenic  and sibling non-transgenic seeds. only about 20% of the seeds survived bta. thus, basal thermotolerance in the ds10:dr <dig> seeds was lost after imbibition and exposure to 50°c. this result is similar to that previously observed for different non-transgenic and for some transgenic tobacco seeds without an enhanced thermotolerant phenotype, such as 35s:a <dig>  <cit> . the germination success of dry mature, ds10:dr <dig> seeds without stress treatment was not affected . in agreement with the lack of effect of ds10:dr <dig> on thermotolerance, we observed similar accumulation levels of ci and cii shsps and of hsp <dig> in the seeds of ds10:dr <dig> lines compared to non-transgenic seeds .

combined overexpression of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa9: further enhancement of thermotolerance and longevity in seeds
the failure to observe an effect of hadreb <dig> on shsp accumulation and thermotolerance in seeds  could have alternative explanations. in this way, the overexpression of hadreb <dig> alone  would be insufficient if the expression levels of endogenous hsfa <dig> factor were insufficient and/or if the properties of hsfa <dig> factors from tobacco and sunflower were different. for example, the tobacco hsfa <dig> factor and hahsfa <dig> could be optimized in each case for functional interaction with a homologous dreb <dig> factor, hadreb <dig> in sunflower. our previous work lends support to the fact that the level of tobacco hsfa <dig> is insufficient. hahsfa <dig> and tobacco hsfa <dig> did not differ in the seed regulation of wild type  and mutant  versions of the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter  <cit> ; this observation supported our decision to use tobacco as a suitable heterologous system . to deal with any limiting factor in the heterologous system, we combined overexpression of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in seeds of transgenic tobacco. ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines were obtained by transforming homozygous ds10:a <dig> lines, which have been described to show enhanced and stable thermotolerant seed phenotypes. seeds from these parental lines also showed resistance to controlled-deterioration, a procedure for rapid aging  <cit> . the ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines were produced from two different ds10:a <dig> backgrounds, these being the previously characterized transgenic lines ds10:a9#6- <dig> and ds10:a9#14- <dig>  <cit> .

initial experiments were performed with ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines that contained different, single, integration sites of the ds10:hadreb <dig> transgene in heterozygosis. this was combined with a single integration of the ds10:hahsfa <dig> transgene in homozygosis . these lines were analyzed for persistence of basal thermotolerance by analyzing mendelian segregation of the hygr marker gene among seeds that survived exposure to high temperature in bta. because the ds10:a <dig> parental lines already showed enhanced resistance in bta  <cit> , exposure to 50°c was prolonged to  <dig> h. seeds that combined the ds10:hahsfa <dig>  and ds10:hadreb <dig>  transgenes showed enhanced persistence of basal thermotolerance. this was strongly indicated by a clear increase after bta of hygr ratios among seeds that survived the treatment. thus, ratios of hygr to hygs increased from the expected 3: <dig> value to values up to 17: <dig>  this increase was consistently observed in independent experimental repetitions performed with nine lines derived from two different parental lines. statistical analyses confirmed a highly significant effect on segregation after bta for the hadreb <dig> gene, when combined with hahsfa <dig> in either parental background . the results of these experiments are summarized in figure  <dig>  allowing for direct comparison with those for ds10:dr <dig> lines that were described above . it is clear that a positive effect of hadreb <dig> overexpression on seed thermotolerance requires the concurrent overexpression of hahsfa <dig> 

in our previous report on seed-specific overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> , we showed that the bta results agree with those of standard procedures used for rapid seed aging and for assessment of seed longevity. one such procedure is controlled deterioration treatment   <cit> . recent work has demonstrated that cdt and natural seed aging involve similar molecular events, such as oxidation of identical target proteins in arabidopsis  <cit> . these findings facilitate the analysis of seed longevity in solanaceae plants, which already resist aging much more on average than that seen in other plants, even without genetic modification  <cit> . natural-aging experiments involving wild type tobacco seeds could thus take several years to complete, e.g., by testing storability at room temperature. therefore, the effect of hadreb <dig> on seed longevity that is indicated by the bta results in figure  <dig> was confirmed using the cdt procedures that we described for tobacco seeds  <cit> . the results included in figure  <dig> also show that hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> enhanced resistance to cdt for  <dig> d at 50°c  in a similar way to that indicated by the bta results. thus, statistical analyses also confirmed a highly significant effect on segregation after cdt for the hadreb <dig> gene in both parental hahsfa <dig> backgrounds used .

further to the positive effect on thermotolerance and longevity, we also observed hints of a deleterious effect of hadreb <dig> overexpression in seeds. in this way, the ds10:a9/dr <dig> plants produced normal seeds and in normal yield, but the germination percentage of unstressed, mature seeds was reduced from 95% to 40% in  <dig> out of  <dig> lines with the ds10:dr <dig> transgene in heterozygosis. however, in most lines showing defective germination, segregation was consistent with the multiple integration of ds10:dr <dig>  this contrasted with the mentioned lack of effects of single overexpression of hadreb <dig> in the ds10:dr <dig> seeds. therefore, both the positive and negative effects of hadreb <dig> required concurrent overexpression of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> . however, in a high proportion  of the ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines, seeds showed unaltered germination under unstressed conditions. these lines and their progeny were thus used for the thermotolerance and cdt experiments in figure  <dig> and for subsequent analyses .

the effects of the ds10:dr <dig> transgene were confirmed in second-generation seeds. from three representative ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines , we obtained after segregation the respective pairs of sibling lines with the ds10:dr <dig> transgene in homozygosis , and without the dr <dig> transgene ; all of these lines also had the ds10:a <dig> transgene in homozygosis. performing bta enabled assessment of the enhanced persistence of thermotolerance. here , we used a higher challenging temperature and for a shorter time  compared to conditions used for assays with the heterozygous parental lines . the results summarized in figure  <dig> demonstrate that the ds10:dr <dig> transgene in homozygosis enhanced seed survival after bta compared to sibling lines with only ds10:a <dig>  seeds that did not geminate after bta were dead, as previously observed for the parental ds10:a <dig> lines  <cit> . comparisons are separated for the a9#14- <dig>  and a9#6- <dig>  parental genetic backgrounds, thus better controlling initial differences in thermotolerance . in addition, within each comparison, we used sibling lines differing only in the inheritance and expression of the ds10:dr <dig> transgene . this provides a necessary control for epigenetic variability  <cit> ; e.g., somaclonal variation, which is a problem that is inherent to tobacco transformation and regeneration in vitro. we confirmed that the additional effect of hadreb <dig> on survival was statistically significant in both the a9#6- <dig> and a9#14- <dig> backgrounds. for example, differences between the germination percentages of single and double-homozygous seeds were highly significant over the duration of the experiments in figure  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows pictures from a representative experiment performed with one of the sibling pairs. besides the obvious difference in percent germination after bta, sibling ds10:a9/dr <dig> and ds10:a <dig> seedling growth was similar; no difference in seedling size was apparent  <dig> d after bta . this indicates that hadreb <dig> did not improve seedling growth after bta further than it was previously observed with the single overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> .

the combined overexpression of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> induces subtle changes in the accumulation patterns of seed shsps
we also analyzed hsp and dehydrin protein accumulation in seeds from the same lines that were used for the bta experiments outlined in figure  <dig>  the use of "syngenic" sibling seed-material was essential for the detection of subtle changes that could be otherwise hidden by epigenetic variation. indeed, western analyses performed after 1d-electrophoresis only revealed a very slight, almost imperceptible, increase in the accumulation of ci shsps in seeds of the ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines. a slightly more pronounced increase was seen for cii shsps, and it appeared clearer for a minor protein species of  <dig>  kda that reacted with antibodies against plant dehydrins . the accumulation enhancement of ci and cii shsps was confirmed by western analyses performed after 2d-electrophoresis. the results depicted in figure  <dig> show that hadreb <dig> specifically enhanced the accumulation of some of the seed ci and cii shsps. in the case of ci shsps, the affected polypeptides included a triplet of acidic spots that are resolved within the major  <dig> kda band. the most basic polypeptide of the same size class was also induced by hadreb <dig> . this corresponds to a minor spot for a heat-inducible polypeptide that is barely detectable in ds10:a <dig> and non-transgenic seeds  <cit> . regarding the cii shsps, we observed an enhancement of the accumulation of all spots resolved around a size of  <dig> kda. such spots correspond to seed polypeptides that are also induced by heat stress  <cit> . this result contrasted with the lack of effect of hadreb <dig> on the accumulation of seed-specific cii shsps, which correspond to the spots resolved around an average size of  <dig> kda . all the changes mentioned here were consistently observed in independent experimental repeats performed with the three pairs of sibling lines.

the content of total soluble carbohydrate was analyzed in seeds from two sibling pairs of lines representing each parental genetic background. the results in additional file  <dig> show that total soluble carbohydrate was the same for ds10:a <dig> and ds10:a9/dr <dig> seeds. this result was not unexpected given that the single overexpression of hahsfa <dig> did not affect the accumulation of total soluble carbohydrate in seeds, in contrast with the reported effect on seed hsps  <cit> .

the combined overexpression of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> does not confer further dehydration tolerance in seedlings
the results in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and additional file  <dig> demonstrate a functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in seeds of transgenic tobacco. to investigate if a similar interaction occurs in vegetative tissues, we combined the overexpression of the two transcription factors under camv35s sequences. double-homozygous 35s:a9/dr <dig> lines, and their respective 35s:a <dig> siblings, were obtained from two different parental backgrounds , which carry a single integration of the 35s:a <dig> transgene in homozygosis  <cit> . the 35s:dr <dig> transgene when combined with 35s:a <dig> did not further enhance the tolerance to severe dehydration caused by the single overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  this was determined by dt <dig> experiments  <cit>  in which whole seedlings from double-homozygous 35s:a9/dr <dig> lines survived dehydration to the same extent as the respective "syngenic" 35s:a <dig> material. figure  <dig> summarizes the results of these experiments, performed with two pairs of sibling lines, with each pair representing the mentioned parental backgrounds. additional experiments showed that the survival of green organs was also not affected . we could not detect an enhancement in the ectopic accumulation of shsps  that is caused by overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . we also failed to detect any effects of the 35s:dr <dig> transgene on the basal thermotolerance of seedlings that is induced by overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> , or on acquired thermotolerance . thus, 35s:a9/dr <dig> and sibling 35s:a <dig> seedlings could heat-acclimate in a similar way, as was previously described for non-transgenic tobacco and for 35s:a <dig> material  <cit> . therefore, hadreb <dig> does not appear to interact with the hsfs involved in vegetative heat-acclimation in tobacco. furthermore, an interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> could not be observed in vegetative organs of seedlings.

discussion
the results presented here demonstrate a functional interaction between the transcription factors hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig>  in transgenic tobacco. the conjoint seed-specific overexpression of both factors was required in order to observe enhanced phenotypes related to seed longevity, as demonstrated by improved resistance to cdt  <cit> . the observed phenotypes occurred in concurrence with subtle and specific increases in the accumulation of seed shsps. however, in seedlings we could not detect effects of hadreb <dig> on hsps, thermotolerance, or dehydration tolerance, beyond what is observed by overexpressing only hahsfa <dig>  our results strongly indicate unique properties for hadreb <dig> in connection with hsfs, seed development and seed longevity. this would set apart hadreb <dig> from previously characterized dreb <dig> factors in plants.

we found that hadreb <dig> differs from other characterized dreb <dig> factors in terms of its stability and its functional interaction with hahsfa <dig>  a class a hsf transcription factor with expression patterns and roles mostly restricted to seeds  <cit> . thus, we could easily detect the accumulation of the ha-tagged hadreb <dig> protein in both the 35s:dr <dig> and ds10:dr <dig> lines . this contrasts with previous reports on atdreb2a, a dreb <dig> protein from arabidopsis. the atdreb2a protein could be detected in vegetative tissues, but only upon deletion of amino acids  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . the observed stability of the hadreb <dig> protein in vegetative tissues is consistent with the absence, in hadreb <dig>  of similar sequences as in the domain involved in the instability of other dreb <dig> proteins such as atdreb2a or rice osdreb2a .

hadreb <dig> is also unlike other dreb <dig> factors such as atdreb2c, zmdreb2a, and wdreb <dig> from arabidopsis, maize and wheat, respectively. these proteins would also differ from atdreb2a in their stability in vegetative tissues. thus, the respective intact proteins have been found to be active when overexpressed in homologous, or even heterologous transgenic plants. atdreb2c, zmdreb2a and wdreb <dig> were able to enhance resistance to heat  <cit> , cold  <cit> , or osmotic stress  <cit> . the abiotic stress resistance was observed without additional negative effects for atdreb2c only  <cit> , whereas the zmdreb2a transgenic plants showed delayed bolting and reduced growth  <cit> , and some wdreb <dig> lines showed delayed germination  <cit> . in contrast, and despite the observed accumulation of the protein in vegetative tissues, hadreb <dig> did not enhance thermotolerance  or dehydration tolerance . furthermore, overexpression of hadreb <dig> in vegetative tissues did not negatively affect growth or development.

the sensitivity to heat stress of the 35s:dr <dig> lines shows that hadreb <dig> did not activate the genetic programs associated with thermotolerance that involve different dreb <dig> factors. these programs involve transcriptional activation of several hsp genes , whereas the 35s:dr <dig> lines did not show altered expression of hsp <dig> or of cytosolic shsps . our results suggest that hadreb <dig> does not activate transcription factors associated with vegetative thermotolerance. among these are hsfs that could differ between different plant species. for example, only athsfa <dig>  one of the  <dig> different class a hsfs encoded by the arabidopsis genome, was found to be a potential, direct target of atdreb2a  <cit> . different class a hsfs such as athsfa1a, athsfa1b, athsfa1e, athsfa <dig>  and athsfa <dig> have been reported to contribute to vegetative thermotolerance and to hsp gene transcriptional activation in arabidopsis  <cit> . in contrast, in tomato plants a single hsf, lphsfa <dig>  appears to play a master role in vegetative thermotolerance  <cit> . whatever the hsf involved in tobacco , hadreb <dig> would fail to induce them, or to interact functionally with them on hsp gene promoters. this interpretation fits with the lack of effect on vegetative thermotolerance and hsp expression in the 35s:dr <dig> lines.

on the other hand, the combined effects of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> on thermotolerance, cdt resistance, and hsp expression in transgenic tobacco seeds would confirm, in a heterologous system, a functional interaction between both factors. we previously reported in sunflower embryos evidence for such an interaction, which was observed on a single promoter belonging to the ci shsp gene family. the hsfa9-specificity involved in the reported interaction  <cit>  and the seed-specific expression patterns of hsfa <dig> proteins  <cit>  would agree with the observed enhancement of thermotolerance in tobacco seeds, and the lack of functional effects in the 35s:dr <dig> lines. the specific functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> would additionally set hadreb <dig> apart from other characterized dreb <dig> plant proteins. based on the effects observed in the ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines, we conclude that hadreb <dig> contributes to the genetic program of seed-longevity and embryo desiccation tolerance regulated by hahsfa <dig>  we previously suggested that the specificity of the synergistic interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> could involve unique sequences, which in hahsfa <dig> included its carboxyl-terminal activation domain  <cit> . we also would like to point out other sequences that are located in the putative carboxyl-terminal activation domain of hadreb <dig>  such sequences may be conserved in some dreb <dig> proteins such as dvdreb2a , but not in atdreb2a .

hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> only interact inefficiently in gst-pull down assays  <cit> . however, physical interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> is not very likely to occur in planta as conditions that would facilitate physical interaction are detrimental for the transcriptional synergism between these two factors  <cit> . this synergism requires the independent binding of both factors to different cis-elements in the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter  <cit> . we hypothesized that the same mechanism could be used for transcriptional activation of other shsp promoters  <cit> . our observations in transgenic tobacco seeds are consistent with such a proposal. only a subset of the proteins encoded by the tobacco ci shsp genes increased their accumulation in the ds10:a9/dr <dig> lines . in contrast, all ci shsps that are detected in tobacco seeds increased their accumulation in the ds10:a <dig> lines  <cit> . a similar specificity was evident by comparing the levels of cii shsps in seeds of the ds10:a9/dr <dig>  and ds10:a <dig> lines  <cit> . the specific effects of hadreb <dig> on seed-shsp accumulation would indicate that hadreb <dig> coactivates  only a subset of the gene promoters activated by hahsfa <dig> alone. for shsp promoter activation hadreb <dig> needs a functional dre similar to one that we characterized in the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter  <cit> . other promoters for shsp genes expressed in plant seeds are yet to be functionally analyzed. only some of the shsp genes in fully sequenced genomes, such as arabidopsis, show potential core dre cis-elements within  <dig> bp upstream of start codons . however, functional dres are very difficult to predict based only on dna sequence information. the nucleotide sequence near the core dre element is important  <cit> , but the conclusive determination of that sequence context would require functional analyses of a number of different promoters. lacking additional examples for shsp promoters activated by dreb factors in plant seeds, we can only speculate on the involved sequence context. its determination awaits the functional characterization of additional shsp gene promoters known to be active in seeds. whatever that context may be, we propose that it is different from that in other promoters induced in vegetative tissues by dreb proteins such as atdreb2a. this could explain why no arabidopsis ci or cii shsp genes were predicted as target gene candidates for the former dreb <dig> proteins, as predictions were based on dre sequence contexts determined for atdreb2a and its target genes . thus, if dreb <dig> factors different from atdreb2a are involved in the regulation of shsp genes in arabidopsis seeds, they could recognize a different dre promoter context. hadreb <dig> and other similar dreb <dig> proteins could recognize the dre sequence context found in the hahsp <dig> g <dig> promoter, which would not be necessarily conserved in arabidopsis shsp genes. this proposal is consistent with the observation in the ap <dig>  domain of hadreb <dig> of amino-acid residues that are conserved in dvdreb2a, ledreb <dig>  and crorca <dig>  but not in atdreb2a .

in seedlings of the 35s:a9/dr <dig> lines we could not detect effects of hadreb <dig> on thermotolerance or dehydration tolerance beyond what is observed by overexpressing only hahsfa <dig>  this contrasts with the conjoint activity of hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in seeds of transgenic tobacco. in consequence, we propose that additional seed-specific regulators might be involved in the genetic program controlled by hahsfa <dig>  <cit>  and hadreb <dig> . vegetative organs could thus lack factors  that would be necessary for the functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig>  such factors would be conserved in the heterologous system  but present in sufficient amounts only in seeds. we will attempt to clone the hypothetical additional factors. future work with these factors might confirm our proposal. finally, we would like to point out that hadreb <dig> could be used in combination with hahsfa <dig> as a tool for genetic improvement of seed longevity, along the lines previously proposed for hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . transgenes expressing hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> could eventually be stacked in elite hybrid cultivars  <cit>  for enhanced effect on longevity.

CONCLUSIONS
we conclude that hadreb <dig> contributes to the genetic program of seed-longevity that is regulated by hahsfa <dig>  we demonstrated a functional interdependency of the transcription factors hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> in seeds of transgenic tobacco. hadreb <dig> would thus differ from other previously characterized dreb <dig> factors in plants in its unique functional interaction with the seed-specific hahsfa <dig> factor. we pointed out amino-acid residues that are conserved in hadreb <dig>  dvdreb2a, ledreb <dig>  and crorca <dig>  but not in atdreb2a. the unique sequences in hadreb <dig> and similar dreb <dig> proteins are located in dna-binding and transcriptional activation domains, which would be consistent with their functional specialization. distinct from atdreb2a and similar dreb <dig> factors, the hadreb <dig> protein appears to be stable enough to accumulate in vegetative tissues. nevertheless, no functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig> was observed when both factors were conjointly overexpressed in vegetative tissues. we therefore suggest that additional, seed-specific factors, or protein modifications could be required for the functional interaction between hadreb <dig> and hahsfa <dig>
