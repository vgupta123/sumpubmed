BACKGROUND
understanding variations in the human genome is the key to unraveling the phenotypic diversity among individuals and understanding various human diseases. genomic variations exist at various levels, from differences in single nucleotides to microscopic chromosome-level variation  <cit> . copy number variations , a new type of genomic variation that has recently received considerable attention, are deletions, insertions, duplications, and more complex variations ranging from  <dig> kb to submicroscopic sizes  <cit> . recent advances in array technologies such as bac arrays, oligonucleotide array cghs, and whole-genome snp arrays, have finally enabled researchers to identify this new type of variation, which had gone unnoticed for a long time  <cit> .

since sebat et al.  <cit>  and iafrate et al.  <cit>  first reported large-scale cnvs among normal human individuals in  <dig>  and since then, many researchers have identified novel cnvs using diverse technical and computational approaches  <cit> . these reported cnvs are collected and maintained in a curated database, the database of genomic variants , which contains more than  <dig>  cnvs obtained from  <dig> publications as of april,  <dig>  however, the discovery of new cnvs has not yet been saturated, and many challenges remain for the standardization of cnv discovery  <cit> . the global map of cnvs from the  <dig> normal individuals in the hapmap collection is an important advance in the field, yet genomes from more individuals from diverse populations should be studied to achieve a full cataloging of human cnvs  <cit> .

whole-genome snp arrays such as affymetrix  <dig> k or illumina  <dig> k arrays, which are widely used for whole-genome association studies, are also useful for cnv discovery since the intensity of the probes can be exploited to detect cnv gains and losses  <cit> . a few recent studies successfully utilized whole-genome snp data from control populations in north american and european countries for the detection of novel cnvs  <cit> . here, we report the identification of  <dig> novel cnvs from  <dig> normal korean individuals by analyzing affymetrix  <dig> nsp snp array data. our work will be valuable in expanding our knowledge of cnvs across diverse populations and ethnicities.

RESULTS
cnvrs from the korean population
commonly used algorithms for cnv detection from snp arrays can produce widely different results from the same data because they differ both in the way reference samples are prepared and in their calling criteria  <cit> . a stringent criterion to select only regions identified by more than two different algorithms is currently recommended to increase confidence in the identified cnvs  <cit> . in this work, we applied three algorithms, cnag  <cit> , dchip  <cit>  and gemca  <cit> , to our data set of  <dig> normal korean individuals genotyped using affymetrix  <dig> k nsp arrays. we identified a total of  <dig> cnvrs, among which  <dig> cnvrs  were novel and not present in the database of genomic variants. many novel cnvs were likely missed by our approach, but we chose to be conservative in our selection of cnvs to reduce false positives. more than  <dig> % of the identified cnvs in the korean population would be novel if we consider a recent study, which showed that most cnv loci are actually smaller than currently recorded in the database of genomic variants  <cit> .

as expected, there were significant differences in the numbers and positions of cnvs identified by the three methods . in most cases, the dchip algorithm identified more cnvs than cnag and gemca. average  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cnvs per individual were found by dchip, cnag and gemca, respectively . in total,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cnvs were found by the dchip, cnag and gemca algorithms. detailed information for each identified cnv is shown in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> cnvs was identified by our criterion of selecting cnvs represented by more than two algorithms. when we compared size distribution between  <dig> duplicated and  <dig> deleted cnvs , we found that duplicated regions had a tendency to be longer than deleted regions . when we plotted each cnv in the genome, we found that most cnvs were located near the band of each chromosome . finally, we defined  <dig> cnvrs from the  <dig> cnvs by merging overlapping cnvs from different individuals .

size and occurrence of cnvs in the korean population
the sizes of the  <dig> cnvs ranged from several kb to several megabases . the smallest cnv was  <dig>  bp, and the largest  <dig> , <dig> bp. many cnvs were in the range of  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb. we also compared the size distributions of the cnvs identified by each method. the smallest, median, and largest cnvs were  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> bp for the gemca algorithm,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> bp for the cnag algorithm and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> bp for the dchip. in general, cnvs identified by the dchip algorithm had larger range than those identified by the gemca and cnag algorithms.

most cnvs  from the korean population were rare , occurring just once among the  <dig> individuals . however, a few previously reported cnvs occurred in a significant proportion of the korean population. for instance, one cnv on chromosome  <dig> was present in  <dig> individuals. generally, there were more cnv gains than losses, and  <dig>  of the  <dig> cnvrs had mixed gains and losses among different individuals. among all autosomal chromosomes, cnvs were detected most frequently on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

comparison by ethnicity
affymetrix  <dig> k cel files from the  <dig> hapmap individuals were obtained from the affymetrix web site and analyzed with the cnat algorithm to identify cnvs at an individual level. also, individual-level cnv data from the  <dig> hapmap samples obtained by the array cgh method were downloaded from the copy number variation project at the welcome trust sanger institute web site . the  <dig> individuals were divided into three ethnic groups – asian , european , and african , and the overlap of cnvs between the korean population and each of the three ethnic groups was investigated . overall, there was a 23–40% overlap in counts and a 23–79% overlap in actual nucleotides in cnvs between the korean population and the three ethnic groups. the korean population showed the highest degree of cnv overlap with the asian population, as expected, but the overlap was less than 40%, implying that many more cnvs remain to be identified from the asian population beyond those identified in the  <dig> asian hapmap individuals.

novel cnvrs from the korean population
among the  <dig> novel cnvrs identified from the korean population,  <dig> cnvrs contained a total of  <dig> genes . the total length of the novel cnvrs was  <dig> , <dig> bp, or  <dig> % of the human genome. the total length of the  <dig> known cnvrs is  <dig> , <dig> bp . twenty-four of these cnvrs contained  <dig> genes.

among the three novel cnvrs, we validated two cnvrs by q-pcr . one case sample, which had a gain of two copies in a novel cnvr encompassing synpr gene, showed a  <dig> -fold increase in dna copy number in comparison to five samples with normal copy number . the other validated region was a cnvr containing krr <dig> gene, in this case, the case sample, which had a gain of one copy, showed a  <dig> -fold increase in dna copy number in comparison to five samples with normal copy number .

we analyzed the functional enrichment of genes contained in the cnvrs from the korean population using the gostat tool   <cit> . the novel cnvrs were enriched with genes involved in regulation and development processes . genes in the previously known cnvrs were mainly related to processes such as cell adhesion, multicellular, development, and regulation of gene expression . our results are in agreement with nguyen et al.'s work, which showed the over-representation of secreted, cell adhesion, and immunity-related proteins in cnv-associated genes  <cit> .

the fact that 15%  of cnvs in the korean population were novel implies that current cnv discovery has not yet plateaued, and that the genomes of more individuals should be examined to fully understand cnvs in the general population. until recently, cnv studies have mainly focused on populations in north america and europe  <cit> . more individuals from other continents, such as asia, africa, and south america, need to be studied to enrich our understanding of the diversity of cnvs in the human population. we stress that the korean population had less than a 40% overlap in cnvrs with the  <dig> asian hapmap individuals, which suggests that more individuals should be studied to fully represent the pattern of cnvs among east asian populations. in this regard, our work on  <dig> korean individuals will be a useful resource for better understanding the diverse variation in the human genome.

CONCLUSIONS
recent studies have shown that cnvs are as important as single nucleotide polymorphisms  or microscopic variations. many studies have reported the identification of novel cnvs, but more cnvs from diverse populations should be identified until we have a full catalogue of the structural variations among human populations. until now, the cnvs of asian populations have not been as thoroughly studied as those of european or american populations, and in this regard our study of cnvs from the korean population will contribute to the full cataloguing of structural variations among diverse human populations.
