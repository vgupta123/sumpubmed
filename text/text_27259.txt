BACKGROUND
introgression is the transfer of genes of one species into the gene pool of another via hybridization. as a phenomenon, it has been an important topic in animal and plant genetics research for many different reasons. for example, introgression has been implicated in the adaptation of modern humans 
 <cit>  and is of concern to conservation biologists due to loss of integrity of wild bird and mammal populations 
 <cit> . in plants, introgression is a key concept in studies of the risks of contamination of natural populations by genetically modified  crops. more commonly in crops, favorable genes from wild relatives are intentionally transferred into breeding lines for cultivar development. this has been particularly valuable in crop species that are relatively low in genetic diversity.

according to a review of crop introgression breeding 
 <cit>  the major functional categories of beneficial traits transferred from wild species are resistance or tolerance to abiotic stress or disease, yield, cytoplasmic male sterility or fertility restorers for hybrid production, and quality traits. among the pioneering uses of wild crop relatives during the late 19th to early 20th centuries were the transfer of disease resistances into grape  
 <cit>  and sugarcane  
 <cit> . a  <dig> review of  <dig> crops estimated that 6% of total annual economic value in the us was contributed by crop wild relatives 
 <cit> . for  <dig> major crops of global importance, it was estimated that  <dig> wild species have been used in released cultivars, and that furthermore, the introgression breeding approach is increasing 
 <cit> . lack of information on pedigrees, unpublished activities within the private sector and changes in taxonomy are some of the factors that contribute to the uncertainty of the collective impacts of crop introgression breeding 
 <cit> .

some of the earliest tomato introgression breeding in the us may have been done indirectly and unwittingly via the french variety merville des marchés. recent phenotypic data collected for merville des marchés pi  <dig> showed it to be variable in fruit size and smoothness ; its genotype was segregating, showed population admixture, and was an outlier based on genetic distance relative to many other s. lycopersicum accessions 
 <cit> . we postulated that these were indications of s. pimpinellifolium in its ancestry . the fusarium wilt-resistant processing variety marvel 
 <cit>  was selected from merville des marchés in the early 1900s, and marvel was a parent of marglobe released in  <dig> 
 <cit> , which in turn can be found in the pedigree of many important varieties from the 1930s through the late 1950s . direct introgression of tomato with wild species in the us commenced in the 1930s concurrent with collection expeditions to geographic centers of origin. the first released cultivar, developed from marglobe x s. pimpinellifolium, was aptly named pan american 
 <cit> . introgression breeding efforts of tomato increased globally post world war ii, involving the screening of a wide range of traits and all wild tomato species 
 <cit> . such efforts continue to be of utmost priority today using sophisticated tools such as introgression libraries for gene discovery 
 <cit> .

compellingly, of  <dig> introgressed traits tallied in released crop cultivars for  <dig> species ,  <dig> of them were in tomato ; the next highest numbers were found in rice and potato with  <dig> traits each 
 <cit> . the emphasis and success of introgression breeding in tomato encompasses several factors including its intrinsically narrow genetic base, relative ease of crossing with several wild taxa, production demands based on growing conditions and market niche, its susceptibility to pests and pathogens, and its sensitivity to abiotic factors. in addition to resistance or tolerance to dozens of bacterial, viral, fungal, insect, and nematode pathogens, hundreds of favorable genes or quantitative trait loci  for abiotic stress resistance, flower and fruit traits, yield, and plant architecture have been mapped in wild tomato species 
 <cit>  and thus hold the potential to be exploited.

introgression breeding carries a cost, namely, genetic linkage of non-targeted loci that are eliminated through repeated backcrossing. linkage drag can persist within a genome despite backcrossing, especially if recombination is suppressed. several examples of linkage drag in tomato and other crops have been quantified using molecular markers 
 <cit> . linkage drag can denote favorable, deleterious or neutral alleles that become inadvertently incorporated into breeding lines or cultivars.

in this study we apply the term ‘cryptic introgression’ 
 <cit>  to describe latent genetic variation in s. lycopersicum that originated from wild tomato species. various scenarios can be evoked for its origins ranging from linkage drag, hybridization between feral s. lycopersicum and wild relatives, to crossing in open-pollinated populations by wind or insect vectors with pollen of introgressed cultivars 
 <cit> . cryptic introgression is of interest in germplasm collections such as those conserved at united states department of agriculture, agricultural research service  plant genetic resources unit  because it can indicate novel genetic variation for exploitation by end-users, or conversely, reveal unfavorable and hence undesirable alleles with respect to crop improvement.

in previous reports we hypothesized the detection of cryptic introgression in 5% to 10% of dna markers that were resequenced in tomato germplasm panels 
 <cit> . the aim of the current study was to gather additional evidence on these alleles by resequencing and analyzing the same markers in several accessions of wild tomato species and one accession of weedy s. lycopersicum . although variation within wild species gene pools made it impracticable to attempt to discover the 100% identical homologous allele, the assumption was that introgressed alleles would be more closely related to the alleles of a particular wild species than to their s. lycopersicum homologs. to identify introgressed alleles we also used evidence from mapped locations of markers, phenotypic descriptions, and historical origins of lines and accessions.

RESULTS
markers and in silico mapping
for the  <dig> markers used in this study , nucleotide primers for pcr and sequencing were originally designed against s. lycopersicum sequences except for the conserved ortholog set ii  and unigene  markers, which were designed against euasterids 
 <cit> . molecular markers have shown good success rates of transferability among distantly related wild tomato species such as s. lycopersicum and s. pennellii . in the current study, some primer pairs did not amplify or give clean or homologous reads in every wild tomato sample. the cosii and u markers did not outperform the other markers in terms of successfully generating high quality sequence data because most of them contained introns, which sometimes carried small indels in a heterozyogus condition. such heterozygous indels were major contributors to poor quality reads and hence missing data.

in our current germplasm panel , s. lycopersicum and s. pimpinellifolium had no missing markers; sequences were available for at least two of the four green-fruited taxa for the final set of  <dig> markers. s. peruvianum la <dig>  s. peruvianum g <dig>  s. arcanum, s. pennellii and s. habrochaites gave data for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> markers, respectively. the latter two species are usually self-incompatible  and carried greater numbers of polymorphic markers within accessions than the inbred accessions of s. peruvianum and s. arcanum that were sampled. mean snp frequency across the polymorphic markers was  <dig>   for s. habrochaites,  <dig>   for s. pennellii,  <dig>   for s. peruvianum la <dig>   <dig>   for s. peruvianum g <dig> and  <dig>   for peru wild. ta <dig>  tomate and s. arcanum had no polymorphic sites in any of the markers.

s. pimpinellifolium showed unusually high polymorphism of  <dig>   relative to the other self-compatible taxa. as one explanation, this accession was categorized as an admixture population in a simple sequence repeat  genotyping study of s. pimpinellifolium population structure 
 <cit> , so naturally represents two dissimilar s. pimpinellifolium genomes. because the seed source traces back to vaughan seed co. in usa and horticultural experiment station, ontario, canada 
 <cit> , another possibility is that s. lycopersicum was incorporated into its pedigree by one of those entities. this may be evidenced by comparing the previously estimated d, number of mutations per kb, 
 <cit>  between the two species 
 <cit>  which was approximately four-fold greater than our estimate reported below.

the majority of markers were mapped with high confidence to a single map location within the genome . this is the first report in which a whole-genome sequence 
 <cit>  and web based tools were available with which to do this for the expressed sequence tag  -based markers 
 <cit> . accordingly,  <dig> of the est-based markers were newly mapped and markers 437_ <dig>  2189_ <dig> and 2819_ <dig> were revised with respect to previously predicted chromosomal location based on identities to restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers 
 <cit> . all chromosomes were represented by the  <dig> markers; numbers of markers per chromosome ranged from one on chromosome  <dig> to eight on chromosome  <dig>  small gaps were observed in the alignments but close examination revealed that these were in masked regions rich in runs of poly a or poly t. only marker 1675_ <dig> did not initially provide any hits. a lowered stringency of  <dig> x 10- <dig> subsequently found the probable position.

four markers had two blastn hits each. these were 1260_ <dig> for two tightly linked  sequences on chromosome  <dig>  2325_ <dig> on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  2582_ <dig> on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and 2819_ <dig> for two linked  regions on chromosome  <dig>  a check of the primer regions found multiple mismatches in predicted primer binding sites of the secondary hit for three of the markers; these were assumed to have amplified as single-copy. for marker 2819_ <dig> the forward primer had a single mismatch and the reverse had no mismatches. the predicted amplicon in the mismatch region was 86% identical to the reference ta <dig> sequence. when the mismatch sequence was included in mega cluster analysis, it separated from all other  alleles with 87% bootstrap support, and the mean d among sequences increased 8-fold . therefore, it is unlikely that this paralog amplified and confounded the results. all markers had previously been screened in our lab for amplification of single bands and highly homozygous sequences within s. lycopersicum <cit> . results of in silico mapping confirmed that this set of markers provides robust results in sampling single-copy s. lycopersicum genes. all sequences were deposited into the european molecular biology laboratory , european nucleotide archive  data base as accession numbers he977919-he <dig> 

clustering patterns and divergence estimates among taxa
pi  <dig> tomate was chosen for the current study to represent a ‘pre-introgression breeding’ genotype. it bears small, slightly ribbed and unimproved fruit with scarring and cracking  and was homozygous for the common s. lycopersicum haplotype at  <dig> of  <dig> markers for which it had been sequenced 
 <cit> . for  <dig> of the markers there was high bootstrap support for the red-fruited clade that consisted of s. lycopersicum including tomate and s. pimpinellifolium alleles . bootstrap values ranged from 54% to 100% . these bootstrap values subtracted from 100% can be interpreted as estimates of the probability of type i error, i.e., falsely accepting a cluster that is not signified by the data .

results underscored the close relationship of s. lycopersicum to s. pimpinellifolium because their alleles were frequently identical or highly similar. the placement of green-fruited species with respect to the red-fruited clade and each other varied among loci. this can result from incomplete lineage sorting or introgression 
 <cit> . an example was the placement of s. habrochaites near s. pimpinellifolium for marker tg <dig> ; this example was also reported by nesbitt and tanksley 
 <cit> .

of the nine markers that did not support the red-fruited clade, seven had previously been hypothesized as carrying introgressions . these are discussed below. the other two markers, 1287_ <dig> and 2280_ <dig>  showed patterns that contained s. peruvianum within the red-fruited clade  seemingly due to lack of resolution. at marker 1287_ <dig> s. peruvianum haplotypes were only one or two mutational steps from tomate. these mutations were not shared with any other taxa. at marker 2280_ <dig> only four unique haplotypes were observed. these were s. habrochaitess. pennelliis. arcanum and {ta <dig>  tomate, s. pimpinellifolium, peru wild, g <dig>  la1537}. for the  <dig> markers that supported the red-fruited clade, accepted taxonomic relationships among tomato species were generally supported 
 <cit> .

divergence estimates  among loci are associated with a high variance over evolutionary time due to differences in mutation and recombination rates, selective constraints, and influences of various factors such as random sampling of gametes and demography. average d ranged from  <dig> for marker 4301_ <dig> to  <dig> mutations per kb for marker c2_at1g <dig> . at the aggregate scale the mean d ± standard error from pi  <dig> tomate was as follows: ta <dig> d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , peru wild d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , s. pimpinellifolium d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , s. arcanum d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , s. peruvianum la <dig> d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , s. peruvianum g <dig> d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , s. habrochaites d =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and s. pennellii d =  <dig>  ±  <dig> .

the lack of precise resolution in distinguishing taxa by clustering, or by average divergence from tomate in the case of the green-fruited taxa was a function of shared polymorphisms in many instances, e.g., at  <dig> markers at least one single nucleotide polymorphism  within a species was also segregating between other species pairs. this has been observed in other studies of crop species and their closely related wild relatives . in addition, random sampling contributed to low resolution, e.g., s. peruvianum haplotypes appeared to be derived from tomate at marker 1287_ <dig> based on a small number of noninformative snps.

evidence for introgression
in previous studies we reported nine markers  with highly diverged alleles within s. lycopersicum and hypothesized that this was due to introgression from wild species. these were 220_ <dig>  437_ <dig>  2325_ <dig>  2534_1r , 2486_ <dig> 
 <cit> , 2819_ <dig>  c2_at1g <dig> 
 <cit> , u <dig> and c2_at1g <dig> 
 <cit> . of the  <dig> markers in the current study, seven of these nine showed patterns in cladograms that did not cluster together members of the red-fruited clade . hybridization networks , descriptive information of the accessions, map positions of markers, and species origins of documented introgressed disease resistance alleles  were used as total evidence to categorize the divergent markers into putative linkage drag during introgression breeding versus natural out crossing with s. pimpinellifolium . this categorization did not constitute proof of natural hybridization versus introgression breeding. however, it was a useful concept from which to synthesize independent lines of evidence and can serve as a basis for future hypothesis testing of the two scenarios.

linkage drag was inferred for at least three of the four markers at which ta <dig> carried an allele that was highly divergent from all other members of the red-fruited clade. all four mapped to chromosome  <dig> and spanned from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb . introgressed disease resistance loci documented on chromosome  <dig> 
 <cit>  include ve <dig>  and ve <dig>  both from peru wild, frl , tm-2a  and sw- <dig> , all three from s. peruvianum, and ph- <dig>  from s. pimpinellifolium . la <dig> was the most closely related allele to ta <dig> in cladograms for the three markers spanning  <dig>  –  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  which encompasses the tm-2a locus at position  <dig>  mb. la <dig> is an inbred accession that was derived from pi  <dig>  the original source of tm-2a .

hybridization networks placed ta <dig> in various positions for each of the three markers surrounding tm-2a: near the red-fruited alleles with reticulation back towards s. peruvianum for marker 2486_ <dig> , between the red-fruited alleles and s. peruvianum with reticulation back towards both for marker 2534_1b , and within the green-fruited wild species alleles between the two s. peruvianum accessions, with no reticulation for marker 220_ <dig> . the size of the tm-2a introgressed region was estimated by mapping in segregating f <dig> populations 
 <cit> . rflp marker tg <dig> at chromosome  <dig> location  <dig>  mb was tightly linked  to tm-2a. the chromosomal position of tm-2a has been characterized as very near the centromere with extremely repressed recombination 
 <cit> . it is therefore probable that markers 220_ <dig> , 2486_ <dig>  and 2534_1b  were part of the introgressed segment in ta <dig> 

the ta <dig> allele at marker 437_ <dig>  was not as definitively related to s. peruvianum and its origin was more difficult to interpret. the cladogram placed ta <dig> in an intermediate position between two clades, namely, {s. pimpinellifolium, tomate, s. arcanum, peru wild, s. peruvianum} versus {s. habrochaitess. pennellii} . the hybridization network showed reticulation with s. habrochaites and the red-fruited alleles . several genes commonly found in tomato varieties have originated from s. habrochaites  or s. pennellii  but none of these map to chromosome  <dig> 
 <cit> . the chromosome  <dig> introgressions listed in table 
 <dig> were judged to be commonly used in cultivars based on an informal survey of descriptions from online seed catalogs  as well as comprehensive reviews of tomato breeding .

linkage drag of 437_ <dig> in ta <dig> with ph- <dig>  or sw- <dig>  was rejected because they originated from s. pimpinellifolium and s. peruvianum, respectively. based on a blastn search of ta <dig> marker 437_ <dig> against the solanaceae plantgdb-assembled unique transcipts  in the solanaceae genomics resource database , ta <dig> and s. habrochaites shared a sympleisiomorphy at nucleotide position  <dig> that was absent from all other alleles that we resequenced. this provided tentative but inconclusive evidence of a direct relationship between the introgression and s. habrochaites. as alternative evidence, fm <dig>  a progenitor of ta <dig>  purportedly carries asc resistance  for which s. pennellii has served as one of the original sources on chromosome  <dig> in tomato 
 <cit> .

the remaining five markers with divergent alleles showed patterns consistent with introgression from s. pimpinellifolium in natural populations. at four markers  the divergent alleles were more closely related to red-fruited rather than green-fruited taxa with bootstrap values ranging from 82% – 100% , although markers 2819_ <dig> and u <dig> did not support monophyly of red-fruited alleles . hybridization networks showed red-fruited species alleles to be distinct from green-fruited species alleles for 2325_ <dig> and c2_at1g <dig>  while 2819_ <dig> and u <dig> showed connections between red-fruited and green-fruited species . marker u <dig> nicely illustrated the s. lycopersicum x s. pimpinellifolium hybrid origin of merville des marchés pi  <dig> . marker c2_at1g <dig> showed an unusual pattern in that pi  <dig>  and pi  <dig> were divergent from all other alleles in the cluster analysis with 99% bootstrap support . this suggested a potential paralog. however, no heterozygotes were observed, the marker did not map to more than one genomic location, and cosii markers were designed to amplify highly conserved single copy genes 
 <cit> .

the divergent c2_at1g <dig> alleles were unlikely to have originated from a green-fruited species because chromosome  <dig> does not carry any introgressed disease resistance alleles 
 <cit> . the hybridization network depicted pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> as branching from s. pimpinellifolium, with complex reticulations at the base of the red-fruited clade that extended through the green-fruited taxa, down to s. pennellii at the root . among the seven unique polymorphisms carried by pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  two were non-conservative amino acid substitutions, two were synonymous and three were intronic. one possibility is that selection at or near this locus has caused ancient polymorphism to have been retained. a significant hka test 
 <cit>   strengthened this interpretation. therefore, diversity at this marker showed patterns of both natural selection and introgression.

additional evidence that these five markers represent s. pimpinellifolium introgressions in natural populations includes geographical origins of three accessions from ecuador where the two species hybridize extensively 
 <cit> , original collection of three accessions dating to  <dig> and  <dig> , the primitive fruit phenotype of fasciation  or wild cherry tomato , and previously reported introgression of pi  <dig> with s. pimpinellifolium by rick 
 <cit> . in estimates of population structure 
 <cit>  pi  <dig>  pi  <dig>  pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> all showed high probability of membership in the second of two populations inferred for s. lycopersicum genotypes, consistent with interspecific hybridization 
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
it was useful to delineate cryptic introgression within s. lycopersicum into linkage drag stemming from breeding versus natural hybridization with s. pimpinellifolium, although this categorization was not definitive and should be subjected to further scrutiny. sequences of the wild tomato species markers in the context of their physical map locations have strengthened our previous interpretations of detection of introgressed alleles in domesticated tomato 
 <cit> . genomic tools for fine resolution of introgressed regions in crop species are increasingly available. the strengths and weaknesses of comparative genotyping to verify introgression have been illustrated here using solanum section lycopersicon taxa.

in the current study the implications of linkage drag of introgressed alleles on phenotype remain unknown. at least one marker  codes for an enzyme involved in fruit ripening . in cultivars or breeding lines it will be more useful to estimate the proportion of a genome that harbors linkage drag. this should be feasible for ta <dig> using bioinformatics given the vast amount of public est sequence data available for this particular line and wild tomato species . importantly, an understanding of linkage drag will help to distinguish it from selection during crop improvement. four of six markers that previously rejected neutrality tests   were found to be introgressed rather than selected. it is anticipated that next-generation sequencing will be utilized to more rapidly eliminate linkage drag in crops 
 <cit> .

natural hybrids will carry high proportions of wild alleles making them somewhat easy to detect using large numbers of molecular markers. the intrinsic value of naturally introgressed germplasm was recognized in common bean  as a source of new alleles for traits such as disease resistance 
 <cit> . in s. lycopersicum, if horticultural effects of introgression are subtle then accessions such as merville des marchés may be prime sources to screen for new alleles. a search of the literature for accessions that were part of the current study  found that pi  <dig> showed high lycopene content, similar to lines containing pigment mutations such as ogc, hp, and dg <cit> .

finally, it is worth noting that rick 
 <cit>  reported the potential of natural hybridization of s. lycopersicum with solanum chilenses. habrochaites , and lycopersicon peruvianum  in regions of chile, ecuador and peru where sympatric populations grow in close contact, although he found no evidence of this based on phenotypes and severe postzygotic barriers are well known. genotyping of populations sampled from these regions would provide evidence to reexamine whether introgression from these wild tomato species into s. lycopersicum has played a role in the crop’s evolutionary history.
