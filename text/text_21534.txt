BACKGROUND
hospital-acquired infections caused by opportunistic pathogens present a serious threat to public health. nosocomial infections are estimated to occur in 5% of all acute-care hospitalizations and in more than  <dig> million cases each year  <cit> . p. aeruginosa is the most common opportunistic pathogen responsible for hospital acquired burn wound infections, urinary tract infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia  <cit> . in cystic fibrosis patients, p. aeruginosa is implicated in chronic lung infections, leading to high rates of illness and death  <cit> . in the increasing aids population, 50% of deaths have been linked p. aeruginosa bacteremia  <cit> . the increasing prevalence of nosocomial infections has been associated to the growing problem of antimicrobial and detergent-resistant pathogens  <cit> . as such, proper use of effective disinfecting strategies in hospitals is necessary to abate this growing problem  <cit> .

ortho-phenyphenol is used as a fungicide and as an antibacterial agent in a wide variety of settings. opp is used as a hospital disinfectant, and as a fungicide and disinfectant for wood preservation, the treatment of vegetables and citrus fruits and textile production  <cit> . results from toxicological studies indicate that opp administered in diet, leads to the formation of tumors in the urinary bladder of rats  <cit> . opp has also been reported to cause sister-chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in chinese hamster ovary cells   <cit> .

despite the aforementioned detrimental effects of opp and its many uses to combat microbial contamination, to our knowledge, the mechanism of action of opp on bacterial pathogens has not been elucidated. moreover, the use of opp as a hospital disinfectant necessitates an understanding of the cellular functions that it affects in different pathogenic bacteria. this will facilitate the determination of its mode of action such that it can be more effectively utilized. further, such information will expedite the development of efficient antimicrobials which target specific pathogenic bacteria and exert nominal effects on other species. in previous studies, whole genome microarrays have been successfully used to analyze the global transcriptomic response of p. aeruginosa to different antimicrobials. from these studies, specific cellular functions affected by the application of these antimicrobials were elucidated through the identification of signature genes that were up or downregulated  <cit> .

to our knowledge, for the first time, we investigated the genome-wide changes in p. aeruginosa gene transcription upon exposure to  <dig>  mm opp for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes using affymetrix p. aeruginosa genechip arrays. our findings show that:  the transcription of genes encoding ribosomal, virulence and membrane proteins  were upregulated after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes  the transcription of genes that may allow transient switches to anaerobic respiration and swarming motility as stress responses were upregulated after  <dig> minutes  after  <dig> minutes, amino acid anabolism and lipopolysaccharide synthesis were upregulated.  after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes of opp treatment, the transcription of the genes encoding the ribosome modulation factor and the alternative sigma factor, rpos were significantly downregulated.

RESULTS
growth inhibition of p. aeruginosa by opp
in order to determine a suitable sublethal concentration of opp that will produce strong growth inhibition, p. aeruginosa was exposed to six concentrations of opp dissolved in dmso , and growth inhibition was monitored at intervals of  <dig> minutes for  <dig> minutes. note that the concentration of opp that inhibits 90% of p. aeruginosa isolates  has been reported to be  <dig> mg/l   <cit> . in figure  <dig>  the highest concentration of opp used  produced marked growth inhibition. therefore, a lower sublethal concentration of  <dig>  mm was selected as the test concentration since this concentration caused a non-drastic sublethal growth inhibition as seen in figure  <dig> 

changes in the transcriptional profiles of p. aeruginosa in response to opp
four separate microarray experiments were performed in the absence  and in the presence  of  <dig>  mm opp. in order to investigate early and late changes in transcription in response to opp, rna was isolated after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes exposure to  <dig>  mm opp. to determine which genes showed significant changes in transcript level in response to opp, the following criteria were applied:  the p-value for a mann-whitney test should be less than  <dig> ,  an absolute fold change in transcript level should be equal to or greater than  <dig>  a gene should have a present or marginal call  from 50% or more replicates on both experimental and control replicate sets. after a one-way anova was performed,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes that make up the p. aeruginosa genome were found to be statistically significant. further analysis revealed that a total of  <dig> genes showed statistically marked upregulation  or downregulation  after  <dig> minutes and after  <dig> minutes exposure to opp. the expression levels of the  <dig> genes in the p. aeruginosa genome obtained from control experiments and after treatment with opp  have been deposited in ncbi's gene expression omnibus  <cit>  and can be accessed through the geo series accession number: gse <dig>  <cit>  .

functional classification of upregulated and downregulated genes
in order to relate the up and downregulated genes to their functions, the  <dig> statistically significant genes were classified into different functional classes. functional classes were obtained from the p. aeruginosa community annotation project  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates the grouping of up and down regulated genes at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes into different functional classes and the total number of genes in each class for the two treatment times. note that a total of  <dig> genes were classified as "hypothetical, unclassified, unknown".

among the downregulated genes, the functional classes of: "adaptation and protection", "amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism", "carbon compound catabolism" and "energy metabolism" contained significantly more downregulated genes at  <dig> minutes compared to  <dig> minutes. the marked differences between the numbers of upregulated and downregulated genes after  <dig> minutes exposure compared to  <dig> minutes of treatment may be related to the growth inhibition observed following exposure to opp.

grouping of functionally classified up and down regulated genes
to further analyze the  <dig> upregulated and downregulated genes, we removed the  <dig> genes belonging to the class designated as "hypothetical, unclassified, unknown". the remaining  <dig> genes were placed in six groups based on their transcription directions. figure  <dig> illustrates the six different groups and the total number of genes in each group. group i contains genes that were upregulated after  <dig> and  <dig> minutes. group ii is made up of genes that were upregulated after  <dig> minutes only. group iii contains genes that were downregulated upon  <dig> minutes of exposure to opp. group iv contains genes that were upregulated after  <dig> minutes only. group v is made up of genes that were downregulated only after  <dig> minutes exposure to opp. group vi contains genes that were downregulated after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes exposure to opp. all of the genes discussed in this report can be found in additional file  <dig>  however, for clarity and to facilitate the reading of this report, the genes discussed below in the six groups are indicated in table  <dig>

group i: genes upregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes exposure
group  <dig> consisted of genes that were induced both at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes exposure to opp . the most distinctive functional class in this group was "translation, post-translational modification and degradation" which contained  <dig> genes . this functional class contained several  <dig> and 50s ribosomal proteins. the two most upregulated  <dig> and 50s ribosomal proteins are indicated on table  <dig>  a complete list of ribosomal proteins in this group can be found in additional file  <dig>  group  <dig> also contained genes coding for translation initiation factors: pa <dig>  pa <dig> and pa  <dig> , elongation factors g and ts: pa <dig>  pa <dig>  and peptide chain release factor:  pa <dig> . the upregulation of these genes after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes suggests that protein synthesis is affected in p. aeruginosa upon exposure to opp and even after prolonged exposure . this may reflect a cellular protective response, whereby proteins involved in stress response are synthesized. the upregulation of the cold shock protein: pa <dig>  and the heat shock protein: pa <dig>  which are involved in stress response supports this hypothesis. the observed upregulation of translation may also indicate an increase in the synthesis of virulence factors, which can be produced in response to environmental stress. previous studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of staphylococcus aureus is stimulated as a protective response against antimicrobial treatments  <cit> . in line with this hypothesis was the upregulation of pa <dig> , which has been suggested to be relevant for pathogenesis in escherichia coli when it is tyrosine phosphorylated  <cit> .

among the genes in the functional class of "membrane proteins" in this group, we observed three proteins of the secy system: pa <dig> , pa <dig>  and pa <dig> secg) were upregulated. in gram negative bacteria, the sec system is utilized for the secretion of degradative enzymes, virulence factors, toxins and proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane and for the insertion of proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> , allowing for growth and survival. the concomitant upregulation of genes involved in the sec system and genes involved in translation is possibly indicative of the transport of synthesized proteins across the cell membrane.

concurrent with the induction of genes of the sec system was the upregulation of genes involved in membrane associated transport of small molecules notably, pa4687: ferric iron-binding periplasmic protein , pa1964: probabale atp-binding component of abc transporter, pa2760: probable outer membrane protein precursor and pa4688: iron iii-transport system permease . these results are in agreement with those of a recent study that demonstrated that the hita and hitb genes were 2- to 8-fold upregulated in p. aeruginosa in response to a two hour exposure to  <dig> mm hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . hita, hitb and hitc  encoded by the hitabc operon facilitate iron acquisition from the periplasm  <cit> . in contrast, a previous study indicated that the hitab genes were downregulated approximately 7- and 6- fold in p. aeruginosa treated with sodium hypochlorite for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . therefore the upregulation of hita  and hitb  in this study is suggestive of active iron uptake, which is essential for bacterial growth and an important determinant of bacterial virulence  <cit> .

it is worth noting that eight type iv pilus assembly proteins belonged to this group including pil c, d, g, i, m, n, o and p. type iv pili have been implicated in the pathogenicity of gram negative bacteria, and mediate cellular functions such as twitching motility, host-cell adhesion and cell signaling  <cit> . the expression of type iv pili is necessary for colonization and maturation of p. aeruginosa biofilms on a variety of surfaces  <cit> . considering that the cellular functions noted above generally mediate virulence and cell survival, it is therefore possible that the upregulation of these genes may be associated with protection and concomitant survival of p. aeruginosa when treated with opp.

five genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis  were also categorized under group i. a previous study that investigated the proteomic response of p. putida to phenol-induced stress noted that several enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, including fabb and fabh <dig> were upregulated approximately  <dig> fold and  <dig> fold respectively when treated with phenol  <cit> . although faba was not mapped in the aforementioned study, it was suggested that under phenol stress, the expression level of faba correlated with the upregulation of fabb. our study corroborates this theory, as both faba and fabb were upregulated approximately  <dig> and  <dig> fold respectively following  <dig> minutes exposure to opp . in contrast, fabh <dig> was downregulated in p. aeruginosa after  <dig> minutes of treatment with peracetic acid  <cit> .

with respect to energy metabolism, the genes: pa <dig> , pa <dig>   and pa <dig> , which are involved in atp synthesis associated with oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain were upregulated at both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes. this result suggests that oxidative phosphorylation is possibly a major route for energy production in p. aeruginosa treated with opp.

group ii: genes upregulated upon  <dig> minutes exposure
group ii contained  <dig> genes, the least number of genes among the six groups . the most upregulated gene in this group was norb , with an approximately four fold increase in transcription . the nitric oxide reductase enzyme is a membrane bound cytochrome bc complex which has been reported to be expressed under anaerobic conditions in p. stutzeri  <cit> . norb is the catalytic component of the norbc complex and harbors low and high spin and low spin ferric heme proteins  <cit> . recent experimental evidence suggests that coupled with electron transfer, proton uptake by norb occurs from the periplasmic side of the bacterial cell membrane  <cit> . as such, nitrate can be used as the terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen under anaerobic conditions, with nitric oxide being one of the intermediates in the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen in the denitrification process  <cit> . nitric oxide produced during denitrification is highly toxic to the cell and relies on the scavenging activity of nitric oxide reductase for cell survival  <cit> . a previous study  <cit>  demonstrated that several genes involved in anaerobic respiration were upregulated in s. aureus after  <dig> minutes of exposure to peracetic acid, suggesting the possibility of a shift to anaerobic respiration in response to oxidative stress.

another gene of interest in this group was pa3479: rhamnosyl transferase chain a . the rhlab operon catalyzes the first gylcosyl transfer reaction required for the synthesis of rhamnolipids  <cit> . rhamnolipids have been found in high levels in the sputum of cystic fribrosis patients and are classified as virulence factors  <cit> . rhamnolipids have been postulated to act as biosurfactants that facilitate surface colonization  <cit> . the multicellular nature of both biofilms and cells undergoing swarming motility indicate that both phenomena are related  <cit> . rhamnosyl transferase chain a has been found to be critical for the exhibition of swarming motility by p. aeruginosa, which is important for environmental adaptation  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that p. aeruginosa mutants lacking type iv pili and flagella are unable to swarm  <cit> . the upregulation of type iv pili assembly genes at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes  supports the possibility that p. aeruginosa treated with opp may exhibit swarming motility as a stress response. the finding that the rhla gene exhibited no change in its expression level at  <dig> minutes also supports this hypothesis. moreover, the probable purine binding chemotaxis protein, pa <dig>  which belongs to the group of flagellar assembly proteins, was also upregulated in this group.

previous studies have revealed that low iron levels significantly stimulated swarming motility, thereby preventing biofilm formation  <cit> . from this observation, it was hypothesized that in an unfavorable nutritional environment, biosurfactant production and surface motility are over expressed in order to prevent p. aeruginosa from settling into a biofilm  <cit> . our results are in line with this hypothesis, considering that the ferric iron-binding periplasmic protein and the iron iii-transport system permease  were upregulated after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes  of exposure to opp, suggesting active iron uptake.

group iii: genes downregulated upon  <dig> minutes exposure
one of the characteristics of this group was the downregulation of genes involved in hydrogen cyanide production: pa <dig> , pa <dig> , pa <dig> . the hcnabc genes eoncode a cyanide synthase, which forms hydrogen cyanide from glycine  <cit> . these results are similar to those of a previous study where the hcna and b genes were downregulated in p. aeruginosa treated with peracetic acid for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . hydrogen cyanide is considered an extracellular virulence factor of p. aeruginosa and its production is transcriptionally regulated by the anaerobic regulator anr and the quorum-sensing regulators lasr and phlr  <cit> . it has been established that hydrogen cyanide is optimally produced when cell densities are high during the transition from exponential to stationary phase  <cit> . p. aeruginosa does not produce cyanide when it is grown under anaerobic conditions, with nitrate being used as the terminal electron acceptor  <cit> . the down regulation of genes responsible for cyanide production, therefore, supports the possibility that p. aeruginosa experiences an oxygen limiting state characterized by a transient switch to anaerobic metabolism. the upregulation of the nitric oxide reductase enzyme  in group ii supports this theory. further, the hcnabc genes did not exhibit a change in expression levels at  <dig> minutes, indicating resumption of aerobic metabolism.

also in this group was the groel gene which encodes a heat shock protein. in a previous study, the expression of groel was unchanged in p. putida exposed to phenol  <cit> . the clpb gene which encodes an atp dependent protease that functions as part of a chaperone network necessary for the recovery of stress induced protein aggregates was downregulated  <dig>  fold. in contrast, the clpb gene has been shown to be upregulated  <dig>  fold in p. putida treated with phenol  <cit> .

group iv: genes upregulated upon  <dig> minutes exposure
group iv consists of genes whose expression levels increased only in response to  <dig> minutes of exposure to opp . this group contained the highest number of genes  among the six groups generated based on gene transcription direction. the significantly higher number of genes in this group compared with the number of genes in group ii , suggests that p. aeruginosa significantly adjusts its transcriptional profile after  <dig> minutes of treatment with opp.

the most dominant classes in this group were "amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism", "membrane proteins", "nucleotide biosynthesis and metabolism", "translation, post-translational modification and degradation" and "transport of small molecules".

compared to the other functional classes in this group, a higher number of genes were involved in amino acid biosynthesis and in translation, post-translational modification and degradation. active protein synthesis was reflected in the upregulation of several genes coding for  <dig> and 50s ribosomal proteins, aminoacyl-trna synthetases associated with alanine , formylmethionine , glycine , leucine , methionine and selenomethionine , phenylalanine  and tryptophan . in addition, genes involved in the biosynthesis of several amino acids: arginine and proline , glutamine , lysine , glutamate , histidine , phenylalanine , serine , were also upregulated. these results are similar to those of a previous study  <cit>  which indicated that the following enzymes were induced under phenol stress in p. putida: argd, proa, gltd , trpb and trps , and cysk and glya- <dig> . based on these results, the authors suggested that phenol-stressed cells may experience amino acid deficits, and hence a shortage of proteins required for growth and survival  <cit> . interestingly it has been shown that e. coli can adjust its rate of tryptophan biosynthesis following a shift to stressful nutritional conditions  <cit> . in contrast, a similar study in our laboratory investigating the effect of opp on s. aureus  <cit>  revealed that several genes involved in amino acid anabolism and specifically lysine and diaminopimelic acid  biosynthesis were markedly downregulated. this suggests that the effect of  <dig>  mm opp on amino acid metabolism in p. aeruginosa and s. aureus differ.

among the genes coding for proteins involved in the transport of small molecules was the tola gene, which codes for the tola protein. the tola protein is an inner membrane protein belonging to the tolqrab protein complex  <cit>  and is necessary for the uptake of the group a colicins and tol-dependent phage  <cit> . tol proteins are also required to maintain the integrity of the bacterial cell envelope structure  <cit> . mutations in tola have been shown to cause increased sensitivity to detergents and certain antimicrobials and the leakage of periplasmic proteins  <cit> . the upregulation of tola after  <dig> minutes of exposure to opp suggests a protective role for tola, possibly related to the maintenance of the cell membrane structure.

in line with the upregulation of genes in the class of "transport of small molecules" after  <dig> minutes, was the induction of several genes belonging to the classes of "membrane proteins" and "protein secretion/export apparatus". the upregulation of the glycerol-3-phosphate transporter gene  and the proton glutamate symporter  is indicative of active transport across the cell membrane. further evidence of translocation was seen in the upregulation of the components of translocation pathways such as the sec dependent pathway  which is driven by atp hydrolysis and the twin-arginine translocation  pathway  which uses energy derived from the proton motive force to translocate proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . interestingly, e. coli with mutations in tatc, which is critical for the functioning of the tat system, show pleitropic defects in the cell envelope, leading to hypersensitivity to some detergents and drugs  <cit> . the peptidoglycan associated lipoprotein precursor , which has been reported to play a protective role against hydrogen peroxide treatment in biofilms of p. aeruginosa  <cit>  was also upregulated. further, several genes encoding proteins in the abc transport system, including the sulfate transport protein , probable protein binding component of iron abc transporter , probable periplasmic polyamine binding protein  and probable atp binding component of abc transporters  were also upregulated in this group. these findings possibly imply that membrane components of p. aeruginosa were altered and that activated and or facilitated transport of ions, sugars, amino acids and other solutes necessary for cell survival was boosted after  <dig> minutes of exposure to opp. it therefore appears that both the maintenance of active transport across and the integrity of the cell membrane are necessary for cell survival after  <dig> minutes of opp treatment.

this group also contained six genes: rfad, mura, lpxa, lppl, lpxb and waaf that are involved in the lipopolysaccharide  biosynthetic pathway. lps is the main component of the outer cell wall and upregulation of its synthesis suggests that adaptation to opp treatment in p. aeruginosa may involve cell wall modification. similar results were obtained in p. putida, where the lpxc, mura and the vacj  proteins were upregulated after exposure to phenol  <cit> .

another predominant functional group in this class contained genes involved in energy metabolism. genes encoding several components of the f1atp synthase  involved atp generation by oxidative phosphorylation and elements mediating electron transfer , ferredoxin i , ferredoxin  and the na+-translocating nadh: quinone oxidoreductase subunit nqr <dig>  were upregulated. other components involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway:  and pa <dig>  were upregulated after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes  and pa <dig> . this corroborates the theory that energy production through this route is essential for opp-treated cells.

an interesting observation was the upregulation of several genes involved in the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines after  <dig> minutes of treatment with opp. the genes: pyrc, pyre, pyrh, belonging to the pyrimidine biosynthetic operon that has been described in bacillus subtilis  <cit>  and the purl gene involved in purine biosynthesis  <cit>  were upregulated, suggesting that an increase in nucleotide biosynthesis may contribute to the adaptive response of p. aeruginosa to opp. in contrast, the quantities of the purm, purl and pyrh proteins have been reported to be downregulated after exposure to phenol for  <dig> minutes  <cit> .

group v: genes downregulated upon  <dig> minutes exposure
this group contained a total of  <dig> genes  that were downregulated after  <dig> minutes of treatment with opp. genes belonging to the functional classes of "amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism", "energy metabolism and "putative enzymes" contained a relatively higher number of genes. it was interesting to find the napa, b, d and f genes among the genes in the class of energy metabolism. these genes are some of the components of the nap operon that has been identified in many gram negative bacteria  <cit> . the e. coli nap operon  encodes a periplasmic nitrate reductase  <cit> . the respiratory periplasmic nitrate reductase in denitrifying p. sp. strain g- <dig> has been reported to support anaerobic growth in the presence of nitrate  <cit> . most nap enzymes consist of a large catalytic sub subunit  and a small diheme cytochrome c . napc is a membrane bound tetraheme cytochrome c that transfers electrons from the quinol pool in the cytoplasmic membrane to napab. napd is found in the cytoplasm and plays a role in the maturation of the enzyme prior to export  <cit>  and napf is a non-heme iron-sulfur protein  <cit> . the downregulation of the nap a, b, d and f genes in this study suggests that after  <dig> minutes of opp treatment, p. aeruginosa probably maintains aerobic growth. this is in contrast to after  <dig> minutes of treatment when the nitric oxide reductase gene was upregulated, suggesting a possible transient switch to anaerobic respiration .

this group also contained several genes involved in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation. in particular, pa <dig> , pa <dig> , and  <dig>  which are involved in the conversion of valine, leucine and isoleucine to alkyl-coa derivatives that feed into the tca cycle, pyrimidine metabolism and propanoate metabolism were downregulated. similarly, the bkda <dig>  bkda <dig> and lpdv genes were downregulated in p. aeruginosa after exposure to peracetic acid for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . the results of the present study suggest that the synthesis of these amino acids was being inhibited after  <dig> minutes of opp treatment with concomitant inhibition of energy production through the tca cycle. further, several genes involved in the synthesis of acetylcoa were present in this group. in particular, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  involved in the synthesis of acetylcoa from lysine and butanoate respectively and pa <dig>  which catalyzes the transformation of pyruvate to acetylcoa were downregulated. these results support the fact that energy production through the tca cycle was being inhibited after  <dig> minutes of exposure to opp.

group vi: genes downregulated at  <dig> and  <dig> minutes exposure
the most downregulated gene in this group was the ribosome modulation factor gene , which exhibited a fold change of - <dig>  after  <dig> minutes of opp treatment and - <dig>  after  <dig> minutes. the ribosome modulation factor  is a ribosome associated protein that is produced by e. coli during slow growth at exponential phase  <cit>  and upon entry into stationary phase  <cit> . rmf is considered a protective factor of ribosomes against stresses such as heat shock, acidic/basic ph and high osmolarity during stationary phase  <cit> . mutant stationary phase e. coli strains without functional rmf are more susceptible to osmotic stress  <cit>  and heat stress  <cit> . the production of rmf by stationary phase cells has been linked to the detection of the dimerized form of 70s ribosomes: 100s ribosomes with no translational activity  <cit> .

in exponentially growing e. coli cells not treated with any chemicals and in those treated with acidifying agents, it was found that rmf expression was growth rate dependent and there was an inverse relationship between rmf expression and growth rate  <cit> . it has been postulated that the function of rmf in slow growing exponential phase cells is to promote more efficient protein synthesis through the inactivation of excess ribosomes, thereby reducing competition for protein synthesis factors  <cit> . our results contrast those of previous studies which have reported that rmf is expressed in slow growing cells during exponential phase  <cit> . it was surprising that rmf expression was downregulated upon both treatment times, but more significantly after  <dig> minutes, given the fact that opp-treated p. aeruginosa cells in this study were also slow growing during exponential phase. however, more investigation is required to determine the mechanism by which opp treatment influences transcriptional control, leading to downregulation of the expression of the rmf gene in p. aeruginosa.

the rpos gene which encodes rpos, an alternative sigma factor of rna ploymerase was also downregulated after both exposure times. rpos is known to participate in the stress response of both e. coli and p. aeruginosa  <cit> . although rpos is more widely considered a global regulator in a complex regulatory network that controls the expression of several stationary-phase inducible genes, it has been demonsrated that rpos also acts as a master regulator of gene expression in exponentially growing e. coli cells exposed to osmotic stress  <cit> . further, a previous study revealed that cell viability was slightly decreased in e. coli cells containing mutations in rmf and rpos  <cit> . the downregulation of the rmf and rpos genes may therefore be indicative of the mechanism of action by which opp causes a growth inhibition in p. aeruginosa.

this group also contained four genes that are involved in the p. aeruginosa heat shock response: grpe, hslu, hslv and htpg. in contrast to these results, the htpg and grpe proteins have been reported to be upregulated in p. putida exposed to phenol and to hydrochloric acid  <cit> . the hslvu operon encodes two heat shock proteins, hslv and hslu that function together as an atp-dependent protease  <cit> . the hsluv operon was upregulated in e. coli after exposure to acid stress for  <dig> minutes  <cit> . this result suggests that transcriptional regulation of the expression of these heat shock proteins during stress may vary depending on the nature of the environmental stress.

validation of microarray data using real-time pcr
in order to validate the relative transcript levels obtained by the microarray analysis, we employed quantitative real-time pcr on six genes. these genes were selected because they displayed a wide range of mrna level changes . table  <dig> indicates that our microarray results were in agreement with quantitative real-time pcr analyses of the selected genes.

the real time pcr results are the mean of three biological replicates with three technical replicates for each gene. the microarray results are the mean of four replicates of each gene.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study represents the first genome-wide response of p. aeruginosa exposed to  <dig>  mm opp. the results from this study indicate that after  <dig> minutes of opp exposure, genes involved in anaerobic metabolism and swarming motility were upregulated. we suggest that p. aeruginosa undergoes a switch to denitrification as indicated by downregulation of cyanide production which is indicative of anaerobic respiration. opp treatment also caused the downregulation of the genes encoding the ribosome modulation factor  and an alternative sigma factor  of rna polymerase which have been linked to decreases in cell viability when mutated. the repression of these genes may be contributory to the growth inhibition observed after p. aeruginosa was exposed to opp and may reflect the mechanism of action by which opp reduces the viability of p. aeruginosa cells, leading to the observed growth inhibition. we suspect that the continuous marked upregulation of translation after both  <dig> and  <dig> minutes and of amino acid biosynthesis following  <dig> minutes exposure to opp are consequential responses to combat this growth repression. our results suggest that these responses may involve the upregulation of genes involved in the synthesis of membrane transport and virulence proteins and also proteins involved in the maintainanceof the integrity of the cell membrane. in addition, after  <dig> minutes of opp treatment, the adaptive response to opp treatment may involve cell wall modification evidenced by the upregulation of lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis genes. it is worth noting that in contrast to the results of this study, we have observed that in s. aureus, opp treatment led to downregulation of amino acid anabolism in general and specifically lysine and diaminopimelic acid  biosynthesis genes . it is therefore apparent that opp exerts differential effects on amino acid metabolism in p. aeruginosa and s. aureus.

this gene expression profile can now be employed to more profoundly understand the mechanisms by which opp exerts a killing effect on p. aeruginosa and how this organism develops resistance to phenolic disinfectants in general and to opp in particular. the information from this study provides useful information that will benefit further research on the toxicogenomic impact of phenolic biocides on p. aeruginosa. further, considering that multicellular behavior in bacteria such as swarming motility is an adaptation to environmental stress, it will be interesting to investigate the comparative response of sessile cells versus cells exhibiting swarming motility to opp treatment.
