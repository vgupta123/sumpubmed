BACKGROUND
a decade-long debate reasons to what extent darwinian selection or neutral processes are driving the molecular evolution of genes and thus the ecological divergence of species  <cit> – <cit> . selectionists argue that a large fraction of those non-synonymous dna base substitutions in coding genes going to fixation should be driven by positive darwinian selection  <cit> . under a strict neutralist’s view, most fixed amino acid substitutions have no effect on fitness  <cit> , because purifying selection constantly removes alleles with strongly deleterious effects on fitness while positive effects were thought to be extremely rare. later, the nearly neutral theory acknowledged that also substitutions with slightly deleterious effects may drift to fixation under realistic demographic scenarios  <cit> . while the neutral theory was the prevailing model for several decades, the comparison of whole genome sequences has recently produced evidence for an important role of natural selection  <cit> . in particular, for drosophila species, natural selection has been shown to shape both the coding and non-coding parts of the genome  <cit> . however, before being able to draw general conclusions on the importance and mode of selection in shaping ecological divergence, more studies of systematically diverse taxa with differing life histories, demographies and mating systems are clearly needed  <cit> . the recent progress in sequencing technology  <cit>  and resultant ability to sequence whole transcriptomes or genomes even for non-model species now opens up this opportunity  <cit> . moreover, such approaches allow at the same time pinpointing the genomic basis of ecologically relevant traits and their evolutionary history  <cit> – <cit> . this may be accomplished in two different ways: based on known ecological differences of the taxa under scrutiny it is possible to assess the processes driving the evolution of genes likely associated with the relevant traits. this is an extension of the classical candidate gene or top down approach. in addition, scanning coding genes for positive selection allows for a bottom up approach, which li et al. <cit>  called “reverse ecology”. the principle of the latter is to identify loci whose divergence was driven by positive selection and to infer hypotheses about ecological differences from their biological function. in both cases, however, it remains challenging to functionally link the identified patterns with observed phenotypic differences.

to contribute to this scientific debate, we have conducted a comparative analysis of larval transcriptomes among the dipteran midge sister species pair chironomus riparius meigen  <dig>  and chironomus piger strenzke  <dig>   <cit> . as co-occurring, morphologically cryptic sister species, they are particularly interesting to perform comparative genomic analyses of ecological niche differences for several reasons. first, due to the shared evolutionary history, their general ecological niche is usually similar, which makes them prime candidates for interspecific competition and, to allow coexistence in sympatry, niche segregation  <cit> . second, fixed genetic differences among them must have evolved during or after divergence, thereby also reflecting the selective forces leading to the observed ecological differences and/or reproductive isolation. third, their coding gene sequences will almost certainly be sufficiently similar to distinguish orthologous from paralogous loci  <cit> . fourth, the short evolutionary distance assures that the incidence of multiple mutational hits at individual sites is negligible, making it possible to infer which mutational changes have occurred since speciation  <cit> . fifth, as morphologically cryptic species, identified differences likely not involve anatomic differences, thereby reducing the complexity of associating gene evolution with phenotypic differences.

the two chironomus species show differential swarming behaviour in the field, acting as a prezygotic isolation mechanism  <cit> . while some studies indicate that c. riparius and c. piger readily form viable and fully fertile interspecific hybrids in the laboratory  <cit> , others estimate fertile hybrids in the wild to be effectively absent, due to fertility reductions caused by hybrid dysgenesis syndromes  <cit> . indeed, no ongoing hybridisation in the field could be found in an early chromosomal study  <cit> , which was corroborated by a field survey applying microsatellites and mitochondrial markers  <cit> . larvae of both species are widely distributed in small streams, ditches, ponds and puddles throughout the holarctic  <cit> . the species are often dominating the local chironomus larval community  <cit> . they frequently occur together at the same sites, however, usually one species prevails at a particular site  <cit> . as chironomids spend most of their lifetime as larvae and usually even do not feed as imagines during their few days in this stage  <cit> , the larval stage is in general regarded as the relevant life cycle stage for ecological studies  <cit> . this is especially true for the two species under scrutiny, c. piger and c. riparius, as they show clear ecological differentiation as larvae  <cit>  but nearly none as imagines  <cit> . field data indicate that c. piger larvae are found preferentially in puddles and shallow ditches with higher maximum water temperatures, higher salinity, in particular higher nitrite and calcium concentrations as compared to sites inhabited by c. riparius <cit> . the latter species often inhabits sediments with high organic content, indicating higher tolerance to anaerobic conditions  <cit> , which was confirmed in different experimental studies  <cit> . in a recent experimental study c. piger coped better with higher nitrite concentrations  <cit> . contrary to expectations from field studies, c. riparius’ fitness tended to be higher at both higher constant temperatures and larger daily temperature ranges. however, the interaction of both stressors favoured c. piger in warm, high nitrite habitats, thus concurring to the field observations  <cit> . based on this previous knowledge on ecological niche differences, proteins with functions in cell respiration as well as those concerning response to temperature and solved ions, especially nitrite detoxification, are promising candidates for interspecific differences driven by positive selection.

in this study, the following three questions were thus addressed: i) is positive darwinian selection a major evolutionary driving force for the divergence of the sister species? ii) can genes with signs of positive selection be conclusively linked to known ecological differences between the two sister species? iii) can we derive hypotheses on yet unrecognised ecological differences between the sister species from the observed pattern of divergence?

RESULTS
sequencing, assembly and annotation
sequencing the larval transcriptomes of the two midge species with the roche  <dig> technique resulted in  <dig> , <dig> quality filtered reads in total . assembly using the clc genomics workbench yielded  <dig>  contigs for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively . mean contig length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius. n <dig> length was  <dig> bp for c. piger and  <dig> bp for c. riparius. ninety-three percent  and 94%  of all reads could be mapped against the obtained contigs.

using the blastx algorithm,  <dig>  contigs of c. piger and  <dig>  contigs of c. riparius matched entries in the swiss-prot database with e-values below the threshold of 1e- <dig>  merging hits with identical descriptions irrespective of the hits’ taxon assignment resulted in  <dig>  unigenes in c. piger and  <dig>  unigenes in c. riparius with an overlap of  <dig>  genes. of all contigs with blastx hits below 1e- <dig> a total of  <dig>  could be annotated with go terms .

alignment quality and sequence divergence
the programme orfpredictor assigned open reading frames , matching the set requirements, for  <dig>  contigs in c. piger  and for  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius , respectively. orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologues from translated sequences of the two sets of orfs from c. piger and c. riparius. as  <dig>  groups only contained sequences from one or the other species, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept. for each group the best-fitting sequences of the two species were then aligned and re-translated. trimming of those alignments ended in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp. of those,  <dig>  alignments  had no differences on the nucleotide level. besides that, there was an apparent peak around 1% sequence divergence between the species . the mean sequence divergence was  <dig> % on the nucleotide level and  <dig> % on the amino acid level, equalling  <dig>  amino acid substitutions in total.

detection of intraspecific genetic variation
single nucleotide polymorphism  identification in the species-specific mappings considered sequencing quality scores of the used and surrounding nucleotides, mapping depth and quantity of the rarer allele for quality control. snp detection across the  <dig>  contigs in c. piger identified  <dig>  high quality diallelic snp positions. after discarding all snps outside the defined high quality orfs,  <dig>  snp sites remained. of those,  <dig>   were non-silent, and  <dig>   were silent. the  <dig>  contigs in c. riparius yielded  <dig>  snp positions in total,  <dig>  of which were within a high quality orf. at  <dig>  snp positions  the two alleles coded for different amino acids, while  <dig>  snp sites  were silent. classification of snps according to the frequency of their rarer allele showed the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps to decrease at higher allele frequency .

snps were classified by the frequency of their rarer allele as follows: low frequency < 5%, moderate frequency 5-15%, and common 15-50%. pn = non-synonymous snps, ps = synonymous snps, pn*/ps* = ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps per non-synonymous and synonymous sites, respectively.

measure of sequence evolution for the whole transcriptome
the estimated average proportion of amino acid substitutions fixed by positive selection, α, amounted to  <dig>  for the  <dig>  alignments included. this estimate is significantly greater than zero with regard to the calculated confidence interval . the analysis was repeated under exclusion of  low-frequency and  low+moderate-frequency snps to correct for slightly deleterious mutations. this procedure slightly elevated α to   <dig>   and   <dig>  , respectively.

mcdonald-kreitman tests
the mcdonald-kreitman test , a robust test for positive selection using substitution and polymorphism data, could be applied to  <dig> alignments showing non-zero values in all four categories of nucleotide changes. of those alignments,  <dig>  had a ratio of non-synonymous substitutions  to synonymous substitutions  significantly greater than the ratio of non-synonymous polymorphisms  to synonymous polymorphisms  with a fdr-corrected p-value ≤  <dig> , hence bore signs of positive selection between c. piger and c. riparius. due to lacking blastx annotations in three of them, eight alignments with reliable signs of positive selection and available annotations remained .

shown are values for all alignments with a significant mkt value  and a significant blastx hit  against the swissprot database. ω >  <dig>  indicating positive selection, printed in bold. x = incalculable due to missing data for the four-species alignments, # = infinite value.

/ >  <dig> is an indicator of positive selection. interspecific ω values are calculated with kaks_calculator using the same alignments as mkt; species-specific ω values are calculated with codeml using four-species alignments.

branch-specific ω
orthomcl built  <dig>  groups of putative orthologous sequences by means of the four sets of protein sequences from c. piger, c. riparius and the two mosquitoes a. aegypti and c. quinquefasciatus. as only groups with at least one sequence per species were analysed further, a total of  <dig>  groups were kept. trimming of the re-translated alignments of the best-fitting sequences per species resulted in  <dig>  final alignments with an average length of  <dig> bp. using the programme paml, signs of positive selection were found in  <dig> alignments  in c. piger and  <dig> alignments  in c. riparius.

among the eight annotated genes with signs of positive selection in the mkt, two had branch-specific ω >  <dig> in one species and ω <  <dig> in the other, indicating directional selection. here, plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig> showed signs of positive selection only in c. piger and mitochondrial sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase only in c. riparius. one protein  showed ω larger than one in both species, indicating disruptive selection between the species. the rest were either incalculable in one or both species due to missing sequence data in the four-species alignments  or had branch-specific ω smaller than one .

discussion
comparative sequence-based studies are highly dependent on data quality. the stringent approach taken here with orthology assignment of high quality contigs and rigorous trimming of the resultant alignments is therefore rather conservative, despite a considerable loss of data. one source of errors that necessitated substantial trimming of the data was homopolymer stretches that pose well-known problems when sequencing with the  <dig> roche technology  <cit> . by only using snps with the rarer allele observed at least twice, a misidentification of snps due to sequencing errors should not have posed considerable problems as the overall sequencing error rate  is only  <dig> % for  <dig> gs flx  <cit> . with a mean coverage of  <dig> observed at the snp positions used, this equals p =  <dig> . considering that only a small portion of those  <dig> sequencing mistakes are base replacement errors  <cit> , the effective error rate is even lower. furthermore, included errors will most certainly contribute proportionally more to non-synonymous than to synonymous snps due to the high ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous positions. the resulting overestimation of the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous snps would therefore rather lead to a lowered, conservative signal of the impact of adaptive evolution in the mkt and the calculation of α.

it is, however, important to be aware of other immanent limitations of next-generation-sequencing-generated transcriptomic data for population genetic analyses. transcriptomic sequences might miss alleles due to allele specific gene expression  <cit> . this phenomenon is wide-spread  <cit>  and may result in an underestimation of intraspecific variation. however, as allele specific gene expression is due to differential dna methylation, this may not present a substantial problem here, as dipterans have lost the main methylation enzymes in their evolutionary history  <cit> . other limitations for the use of our data are due to the experimental design. the pooling of individuals, although a common and recommended strategy for non-model organism studies aiming to identify as many alleles as possible  <cit> , did not allow scoring individual genotypes, which in turn precluded calculations of allele frequencies. for this study,  <dig> individuals per species were sequenced at a mean mapping depth of  <dig>  nucleotides per position for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius across all loci. as we have used a minimum coverage of  <dig> reads per position in each species for snp detection, we have discovered only segregating alleles with a frequency over  <dig>  with a probability of > 90%.

interspecific patterns for the whole transcriptome
the mean interspecific nucleotide sequence divergence of  <dig> % on the cdna level, the mean silent site rate in coding regions  of  <dig>  and the fact that  <dig>  alignments  showed no differences at all, together illustrate the relatively close phylogenetic relationship between the sister species c. piger and c. riparius. accordant calculations between two reproductively isolated ‘biotypes’ of the cryptic whitefly species bemisia tabaci revealed a mean divergence of  <dig> %  <cit> , while  <dig> % divergence were found between the two closely related drosophila species d. simulans and d. sechellia <cit>  and  <dig> % divergence between two very young sympatric crater lake cichlid fishes  <cit> . a recent study across transcriptomes of the copepod tigriopus californicus even revealed higher median divergence on the interpopulation level . on the other hand, the conservative alignment strategy taken here, with exclusion of seemingly too heterogeneous parts, may have led to a slight underestimation of the overall sequence divergence, as suggested by the  <dig> % of coding sequence divergence in the vwvz/7b globin gene cluster of c. piger and c. riparius <cit> .

since estimations of the species divergence time of c. piger and c. riparius based on large amounts of sequence data are lacking to date, the overall synonymous substitution rate of the orfs was used for a rough molecular clock calculation. drosophilids are the best-analysed dipteran system concerning molecular clock analyses with rates of synonymous substitution per synonymous site per million years of  <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig>   <cit> , and  <dig>   <cit> . transferring these brachyceran rates to the nematocerans c. piger and c. riparius resulted in an estimation of the species splitting event about  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years ago, which translates to a multiple number of generations since divergence in this multivoltine species. this time frame clearly illustrates the existing potential for evolutionary processes to shape the species’ genomes.

number of genes identified
the number of genes found in the larval transcriptomes of c. piger  and c. riparius  is roughly a third to half the number of genes found in the genomes of the nematocerans anopheles gambiae [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> , aedes aegypti [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> , culex quinquefasciatus [n =  <dig> ,  <cit>  and the dipteran drosophila melanogaster [n =  <dig> ,  <cit> . the discrepancy is explained by the fact that certainly not all genes are expressed in the l <dig> stage of the midges and only a single stressor  was applied. for example, drosophila larval stages were shown to express only  <dig>  to  <dig>  different mrnas at once  <cit> . moreover, using non-normalised cdna libraries likely resulted in missing genes with low expression levels.

global patterns of gene evolution
the α statistics showed approximately a quarter  of the  <dig>  amino acid substitutions to be driven by positive selection. this finding is close to the average of  <dig> % found by eyre-walker in a meta-study of  <dig> interspecies comparisons  <cit> . in another meta-study fay reported that 47% of  <dig> analysed species showed signs of positive selection, often affecting ca. 40% of all non-synonymous substitutions  <cit> . among other factors, the level of adaptive evolution was shown in the former study to positively correlate with effective population size  <cit> . bayesian coalescence analysis of published mitochondrial coi sequences estimated the effective mitochondrial population size to be quite high with  <dig>  ×  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  x  <dig>  for c. riparius, respectively  <cit> . an average fst of  <dig>  for c. piger and  <dig>  for c. riparius indicates little among population differentiation in both species  <cit> . drift within both species thus seems to be a minor driving force here, a circumstance rendering natural selection particularly effective  <cit> .

inference of positive selection from polymorphism data
for the detection of positive selection on the level of individual genes, most reliable results can be gained from the mk test, which is more robust to demographic biases than, e.g. the popular dn/ds method  <cit> . however, the mk approach necessitated a more than 80% reduction of the data set, due to the high sequence similarity between the sister species. of the remaining  <dig> genes used to calculate mk statistics,  <dig>  showed significant signs of positive selection.

this proportion of  <dig> % of positively selected candidate genes inferred with the mkt appears rather moderate. this is especially so, since the genes expressed in the final larval stage of chironomids should be particularly prone to increased diversifying selection compared to the rest of the genome, because this is the phase in the life of the midges during which the competition  is potentially most severe among species  <cit> . a recent genomic comparison of congeneric shallow and deep sea urchins indeed confirms that in particular genes expressed in the ecologically divergent life cycle stage show increased signatures of positive selection  <cit> . the chironomid l <dig> transcriptomes may thus perhaps even overestimate the impact of adaptive evolution on the entire coding genome. on the other hand, the mkt is rather conservative and positive selection having occurred early in divergence may have lost its signature  <cit> .

ecological implications of positively selected genes
although a sign of positive selection alone is only the first step in defining the genetic basis of ecological differentiation, such analyses are able to deliver promising potential candidate genes  <cit> . among the eleven genes with significant signs of positive selection in the mkt, eight could be functionally annotated. five of these genes suggest a correlation either to observed or so far unrecognised ecological differences between c. piger and c. riparius or to the evolution of reproductive isolation.

one of them, calreticulin, is a chaperone involved in protein folding and rejection of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . it might thus be linked to the different maximum temperatures in the respective habitats of c. riparius and c. piger <cit> , as increased temperature destabilises and degrades proteins  <cit> .

the nadh-cytochrome b <dig> reductase  <dig> is also known as methemoglobin reductase, which describes its main function, the reduction of methaemoglobin to haemoglobin  <cit> . one of the main environmental agents causing the formation of detrimental methaemoglobin are nitrate/nitrite  <cit> , thus matching the observed and experimentally confirmed differential adaptation of the chironomid sister species to environmental nitrite concentrations  <cit> . an increased efficiency due to positive selection in converting methaemoglobine would certainly explain the higher nitrite tolerance of c. piger and thus identify a genomic basis for the observed niche difference. because chironomids possess more than  <dig> different globins  <cit>  which can make up as much as 90% of the last instar’s total hemolymph protein  <cit> , this might be of particular importance. unfortunately, the methemoglobin reductase was not found in the dataset of all four taxa used in the branch-specific test, which precludes the inference of the direction of selection.

the branch-specific ω for plasma membrane calcium-transporting atpase  <dig>  revealed positive selection on the c. piger branch , as opposed to a neutral evolution of this gene in c. riparius . pmca <dig> is responsible for the removal of calcium out of the cell  <cit> . interestingly, pfenninger and nowak  <cit>  demonstrated conductivity in general and caco <dig> concentrations in particular to be significantly correlated to the relative abundance of c. piger and c. riparius, with the latter preferring lower concentrations, thus lending ecological plausibility to pmca <dig> as a candidate gene for positive selection.

besides proposing candidate genes for the known ecological differences between c. riparius and c. piger, the reverse ecology approach of studying whole transcriptomes also yields novel gene candidates with plausible relevance to the ecology and evolution of the sister taxa:

sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase is involved in hydrogen sulfide detoxification  <cit> . hydrogen sulfide is produced by microorganisms under anaerobic conditions, being highly toxic to most metazoans. the prevalence of c. riparius in anaerobic habitats like sewage sludge  <cit>  might therefore at least partly be based on higher hydrogen sulfide tolerance. in accordance with this hypothesis is the high ω detected on the c. riparius branch  for sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase in contrast to the c. piger branch , suggesting adaptation to increased h2s levels in sediments of eutrophic water.

the nuclear encoded 39s ribosomal protein l <dig> interacts closely with mitochondrially encoded rrna molecules  <cit> , thus providing the basis for cytonuclear coevolution, in which structural changes in one partner  provide the stage for selection-driven compensatory changes in the interaction partner  <cit> . intriguingly, the branch specific analysis shows positive selection along the branches of both species. if the resulting changes in protein structure led to incompatibilities with the mitochondrial rrna of the respective other species in the formation of mitochondrial ribosomes, they may at least partially explain the observed reproductive isolation in the wild  <cit> . cytonuclear incompatibilities indeed have been shown to confer reproductive isolation among other insects species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in accordance with recent meta-studies  <cit>  on the genome-wide prevalence of positive selection in insects, the data presented here argue that such darwinian processes are likely to have played an important role in the divergence of chironomus piger and c. riparius. several gene loci showing signatures of directional or disruptive positive selection can explain observed ecological characteristics of niche divergence. in addition, the reverse ecology approach pointed towards a new hypothesis with respect to the higher anaerobic tolerance of c. riparius. the signs of positive selection on a sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase gene in this species suggest the possibility that this adaptation depends at least partly on a higher h2s-tolerance.

obviously, the above hypotheses, based solely on bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome sequences, need further investigations, in particular ecological experiments and functional protein assays, to functionally link the proposed candidate genes to the observed traits. in addition, there are likely several, if not many other fixed functional differences among the sister species, which affect protein structure and gene expression and thereby determine their respective niches. the presented study is therefore but a first step to fully understand the genomic basis of the ecological differences between c. piger and c. riparius. however, since many of the known ecological differences are plausibly mirrored by patterns of sequence evolution, the taken approach appears to be a valuable starting point to dig deeper into the genomic details of niche segregation.
