BACKGROUND
the association between improved health and probiotic bacteria consumption was first documented more than a century ago. since then, numerous species of bacteria have been examined for their potential health benefits, particularly within the late two decades  <cit> . data from these studies suggest that the effects upon the host might be attributable to the probiotic bacteria themselves through an immunomodulatory activity. these species are able to survive in the human gastrointestinal  tract and influence the host enteric microbiota, which subsequently modulate host immunophysiologic responses. in addition, numerous in vitro, animal model, and human studies also suggest that many of these same species are capable of producing a significant impact upon the host immune system as well  <cit> .

as described by vinderola et al., the two primary routes that probiotic species are able to impact the host are through their direct colonization of the host as well as indirectly by the subsequent release of various metabolites from these species  <cit> . the former functions via an influence upon the balance of the gut microbial environment. whereas, the latter route functions through more complex pathways, such as immune recognition of bacterial envelope components, activation of toll-like receptors, cd <dig>  mannose receptors, etc.  <cit> . these events have been demonstrated to promote the rapid activation of the nf-κb and stat transduction pathways, which subsequently induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . in fact, many characterized probiotic effects are mediated through immune regulation, particularly through perturbations in the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines  <cit> . thus, probiotics can be employed therapeutically to alleviate intestinal inflammation, normalize gut mucosal dysfunction, and down-regulate hypersensitivity reactions  <cit> . furthermore, this approach also has a robust safety record. thus, probiotics have many properties that make them highly desirable for the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of ailments  <cit> .

previous data has suggested that careful attention should be utilized when selecting strains to be used for probiotic therapy, as differences do exist in the immunomodulatory capacity of bacterial strains. consequently, we were particularly interested in isolating a probiotic strain with both strong probiotic potential as well as immunomodulatory activity. to this end, we recently isolated a novel lab, lactobacillus casei zhang  from koumiss  widely used in traditional mongolian medicine in the inner mongolia region of china  <cit> . lczhang exhibited favorable probiotic properties, such as acid resistance, bile resistance, gi colonization ability, etc.  <cit> . in order to elucidate the immunomodulatory effects of lczhang, we administered healthy mice with varying doses of either live or heat-killed lczhang and measured the level of various cytokines, immunoglobulin g , and t-cell populations in the serum, il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor gene expression in the spleen, and secretory immunoglobulin a  in the intestine.

RESULTS
live lczhang elicits ifn-γ production and inhibits tnf-α production in a dose-dependent fashion
lcactobacillus zhang is initially isolated strain from homemade koumiss and determined to be lactobacillus casei using  <dig> s rrna-based phylogenetic analysis together with a wide array of biochemical assays  <cit> . in order to examine the immunomodulating capacity of lczhang, we began by examining its effect upon cytokine levels in the circulating blood of healthy mice. we quantified ifn-γ and il- <dig> levels in the sera of mice receiving a daily dose of lczhang for  <dig> consecutive days. the level of ifn-γ increased in all the three dose groups . however, only the high dose group elicited a significantly higher response  compared to the heat killed group and control group . il- <dig> also increased, but none of groups exhibited a significant difference .

as shown in figure 1c, tnf-α production was significantly reduced with a high dose  and medium dose of lczhang . the effect of lczhang administration on il-1α production is shown in figure 1d. no significant changes were observed, though il-1α levels were slightly reduced. in addition, the effects were dose-dependent. no significant changes were observed to heat killed lczhang administration .

il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor gene transcription
in addition to circulating cytokine levels, we were also interested to determine whether lczhang had the ability to affect cytokine transcription as well. therefore, il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor gene transcription were measured after the intake of lczhang. as shown in figure 2a, significant increases in il- <dig> gene transcription were detected at day  <dig> and  <dig> with all dose groups and at day  <dig>  il- <dig> mrna levels peaked at almost double the control. by day  <dig>  both il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor gene transcription had decreased with only the high dose samples remaining significantly different from the control . throughout the assay period, il-2r gene transcription showed a similar trend with that of il- <dig> .

t cell subpopulation patterns
the proportion of cd3+, cd4+, and cd8+ t cells tended to increase slightly over the assay period, but the differences were not significant. both cd4+, and cd8+ t-cells and the ratio of cd4+/cd8+ did not seem to be affected by lczhang .

intestinal siga production
intestinal content from the caecum and distal colonic sections were collected from each mouse and the siga concentration was measured . a significant increase in the concentration of this immunoglobulin was also observed at all dose groups compared to the control. similar to that of igg, by the fifth day, siga levels peaked and subsequently decreased to a relatively stable level. however, from days  <dig> –  <dig>  a slight increase in the level of siga was observed for each of the dose groups . at its peak level on day  <dig>  the high dose group exhibited 4-fold increase in siga over the control, while medium and low dose groups both showed about a 3-fold increase.

igg production in serum
discussion
the potential health benefits of consuming lactic acid bacteria  are increasingly being recognized. in fact, there are some suggestions that lab commonly used in the dairy industry are therapeutic for diseases such as cancer, various infections, gi disorders, asthma, etc. because the immune system is an important contributor to each of these diseases, the immunoregulatory effects of lab were of primary interest. in those studies, cytokine production, antibody  production, phagocytic activity, peyer's patch  activation, t cell function, and natural killer  cell activity were shown to increase with lab consumption or when cells were exposed to lab in vitro or in vivo  <cit> . it is noted that probiotics interferes basal lymphoproliferation or mitogen-stimulated t- and b-cell proliferation  <cit> .

the present study focuses on the immunoregulating capacity of lczhang, which is a nice probiotic candidate  <cit> . our data showed that the pro-inflammatory cytokines ifn-γ can be increased in a dose dependent manner after the intake of viable lczhang. ifn-γ is a typical type  <dig> helper t cell  cytokine and the augmentation of th <dig> cytokines are known to enhance various immune responses. il- <dig> stimulates the production of ifn-γ and is at least partially associated with the production of th <dig> cells. furthermore, probiotics have been suggested to affect dc maturation and functioning  <cit> . labs may potentially influence the development of th <dig> and th <dig> via changes in dc types and/or the extent of maturation  <cit> . usually, the immunoregulatory effects of probiotics can be ascribed to a skew of the th1/th <dig> balance in favor of th <dig> mediated immunity  <cit> . consequently, the release of the th <dig> associated cytokines il- <dig>  ifn-γ and tnf-α by various cell types has been demonstrated to be increased by lab  <cit> , which could help to mediate cellular immunity and inhibit the proliferation of th <dig>  <cit> . unexpectedly, our results with lczhang do not completely agree with those reported previously. specifically, a reduction of tnf-α was observed in the serum. as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tnf-α plays a pivotal role in inflammation, mediating fevers, and inducing the liver to produce various detrimental proteins. in certain immune deficiency disorders, elevated tnf-α production has been demonstrated to be a mediator of some of the disease pathology  <cit> . thus, lczhang administration may have some potential utility to help moderate the inflammation associated with elevated tnf-α.

also, via rt-pcr we detected a significant increase of il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor gene transcription level after  <dig> days of oral administration of lczhang. il- <dig> can induce the proliferation of activated t- and b-cells, enhance nk cytotoxicity, and increase the killing activity of monocytes and macrophages for tumour cells and bacteria  <cit> . increased il- <dig> and il- <dig> receptor transcription also implicates the activation of t cells. collectively, oral administration of lczhang elicits a modest level of systemic immunoenhancing effects. in this study, the level of siga in the intestine was increased by the oral administration of lczhang. intestinal secretory iga plays a principal role in the intestinal immune system: it prevents infection by inhibiting the attachment of bacteria and viruses to the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . since lczhang was able to stably increase the level of siga for at least  <dig> days, it is conceivable that lczhang may have the ability to improve the gastrointestinal mucosal resistance to infections  <cit> . indeed, similar results have ever been found with other probiotic strains  <cit> , but further studies are needed to verify whether this is also the case with lczhang.

the glycoprotein immunoglobulin g  accounts for about 75% of the total immunoglobulins in plasma of healthy individuals. immunoglobulin g  antibodies are predominately involved in the secondary antibody response, which occurs later following antigen recognition. the presence of specific igg generally corresponds to maturation of antibody response. it is interesting that total igg level in sera increased after administered lczhang in the present study. with temporal increased igg level, igg level restored to normal level after  <dig> days administration of lczhang, which is still significantly higher than control group. it is conceivable that some biological activate peptides released from lczhang may involve in triggering secondary antibodies responses. the mechanism of action is still unknown, further investigation required to evaluate changes of igg sub-classes, other classes of ig, such as ige or igm, etc.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this data indicated that oral administration of lczhang is able to modulate immune responses. the effects exhibit strong dose-dependent characteristics and is consistently related to the viability of this bacteria. also, oral administration of lczhang effected the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which suggests a mechanism by which lczhang could enhance specifically local as well as systemic immune responses. further studies are necessary to better assess the full breadth of the immunomodulatory activities of lczhang. in addition, it is of great interest to measure the effects of koumiss ingestion upon immune system activation in the local population of inner mongolia.
