BACKGROUND
homeobox genes are characterized by a conserved  <dig> base pair motif encoding a homeodomain with three structurally conserved helices  <cit> . the tale superfamily is distinguished by a three-amino-acid loop extension  between helix  <dig> and helix  <dig> within the homeodomain  <cit> . the third helix is highly conserved playing the major role in dna binding site recognition  <cit> . tale homeodomain proteins are critical transcription factors for embryonic and early development  <cit> . tgif  genes are members of tale superfamily, containing tgif <dig>  tgif <dig>  tgiflx and tgifly  <cit> .

tgif <dig> orthologues share a high similarity inside the homeodomain between distantly related vertebrates  <cit> . tgif <dig> is a smad transcriptional co-repressor that negatively regulates tgf-β-activated gene expression in vertebrates  <cit> . in drosophila, tgif <dig> is a transcriptional activator interacting with mad and smad <dig>  <cit> . in humans, tgif <dig> is highly expressed in the placenta and other adult tissues such as liver, kidney and gonads  <cit> . mutations in tgif <dig> can cause holoprosencephaly , a severe disease affecting forebrain and craniofacial development, associated with mental retardation  <cit> . two isoforms of tgif <dig> were identified by rt-pcr from alternative splicing events that are specific to the mouse  <cit> . both alternative splice forms are functional as transcriptional repressors  <cit> . mouse tgif <dig> mrna is initially detected at e <dig>  with the highest expression in the forebrain, the branchial arches, the otic pit, and the limb buds but not in the heart  <cit> . subsequently the expression is maintained at a higher level from then on in the forebrain but declines throughout the whole embryo by e <dig>   <cit> . however, tgif <dig> knockout mice do not have any abnormal phenotypes  <cit> , possibly due to a functional redundancy with tgif <dig>  since both occupy similar spatial and temporal expression domains during embryogenesis  <cit>  and both are co-repressors for tgf-β receptor activated smads by interacting with histone deacetylases   <cit> .

tgif <dig> shares similar dna binding homeodomains to tgif <dig>  suggesting both proteins are likely to bind the same dna sequence  <cit> . human tgif <dig> has  <dig> exons which have the highest homology with tgif <dig>  there are two alternative splicing forms of tgif <dig> genes one of which contains a retained intron within the second coding exon that occurs only in mice  <cit> . both forms of tgif <dig> mrna transcripts are present and functional as transcriptional repressors in adult and embryonic tissues in mice and have similar expression patterns  <cit> . tgif <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart, kidney and testis, but the transcript is almost undetectable in the brain and prostate  <cit> . in the mouse, tgif <dig> transcripts are highly expressed in the nervous system at e <dig>  and e <dig> , indicating this gene has a wide but well controlled expression pattern during early embryo development  <cit> . both tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> are required for gastrulation in mice and act to limit nodal signalling and l-r axis specification  <cit> .

in addition to the autosomal tgifs described above, orthologues exist on the eutherian mammal × and y-chromosomes, tgiflx  and tgifly . tgifly lacks the specific c-terminal residues shared by tgiflx, tgif <dig> and tgif <dig>  <cit> . the tgiflx gene originated from autosomal tgif <dig> by retrotransposition  <cit> , characterized by loss of introns, poly a tracts, and flanking short direct repeats  <cit> . tgiflx has  <dig> exons with a  <dig> base-pair intron  <cit> . tgif <dig> and tgiflx share high conservation both within the homeodomain and the c-terminus conserved region but show extensive variation outside these domains  <cit> . tgiflx is highly conserved between primates. there is an orthologue in mice, tex <dig> ,  <cit> , indicating that the tgiflx retrotransposition event occurred at least  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . tgiflx/tex <dig> expression is restricted to the adult testis  <cit> . tex <dig> mrna is detected in the spermatids in the seminiferous tubule and in some residual bodies, suggesting that it may play a critical role in spermatogenesis  <cit> . unlike tgif <dig> and tgif <dig>  this gene is not expressed in the brain, so it is unlikely to be involved in brain development  <cit> .

x-linked genes are believed to evolve more rapidly than their autosomal orthologues due to their hemizygosity in males  <cit> . the mammalian sex chromosomes emerged from an ancestral pair of autosomes  <cit>  and have received specific additions and deletions in each lineage. a large number of genes on the x-chromosome have a role in mammalian spermatogenesis  <cit> . human tgiflx maps to xq <dig>  in human  <cit> , within a region recently added to the x-chromosome in the eutherian lineage  <cit>  and is expressed in the testis  <cit> . homeobox genes expressed in the testis such as tgiflx and esx1l are biased on the x-chromosome  <cit> . two forms of tgif genes  identified in drosophila are crucial for spermatogenesis, suggesting that there is an ultra-conserved function for these genes in all animals  <cit> .

to date, tgiflx and its orthologues have only been studied in eutherian mammals. since marsupial mammals diverged from eutherian mammals between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> , we investigated whether this gene was present in a marsupial, the tammar wallaby, macropus eugenii. we characterised tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> orthologues in the tammar, identified their chromosomal location, and examined their expression throughout development and in adult tissues.

RESULTS
the absence of tgiflx and identification of tgif <dig> &tgif2
human tgiflx  was used to search all available genome databases to identify tgiflx-related sequences. an orthologue of tgiflx was identified from the horse but its chromosomal location is unknown. horse tgiflx shared high similarity through the exons and both upstream and downstream flanking sequences. another orthologue was identified from the mouse known as tex <dig> which only shared partial similarity in the homeobox region. no orthologues were identified from other species including the tammar, platypus, chicken and fish .

owing to the absence of a tgiflx orthologue in non-eutherian mammals, the marsupials and monotremes, another blast search was performed for its progenitor gene tgif <dig> and paralogue tgif <dig> from various species including reptiles, amphibians, fish and flies. it showed orthologues of tgif <dig> were present in all vertebrates investigated. tgif <dig> orthologues shared the same upstream gene myl <dig> in most vertebrates except fish and the downstream gene sla <dig> that was only present in therians. the tgif <dig> orthologues were poorly conserved at the first exon . no orthologue of human tgif <dig> was identified in the fly genome. the tgif <dig> orthologues were identified in all species examined and shared the same upstream gene myom <dig>  and downstream gene dlgap <dig> .

characterization of tammar tgif <dig> and tgif2
tammar tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> were amplified from adult tammar testis by reverse-transcriptase pcr  with cross-species primers. the tammar full-length tgif <dig> cdna encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> amino acids longer than human and mouse orthologues. the predicted tammar tgif <dig> protein contains  <dig> amino acids,  <dig> amino acids shorter than eutherian orthologues. tammar partial genomic sequences from ncbi http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi were retrieved by alignment with tammar tgif and used to confirm their genomic structure. tammar tgif <dig> has  <dig> exons and the open reading frame spanned all exons. the homeobox was located within the second exon. similarly, tammar tgif <dig> also contains  <dig> exons but the coding region only spanned exons  <dig> and  <dig> 

alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences of various orthologues of the tgif family from human and tammar revealed that they were highly conserved over the homeodomain and carboxyl-terminal conserved domain  . both tammar tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> contained a three-amino acid loop extension  between the α <dig> helix and α <dig> helix, confirming that tammar tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> belong to the tale super-family. the α <dig> helix was identical between human and tammar tgif <dig> and tgif <dig>  in addition, the region containing the mitogen-activated protein  kinase phosphorylation sites  close to the carboxyl-terminal conserved domain was identical in human and tammar tgif1/tgif <dig>  however, the region outside the conserved domain had a very poor similarity and identity, especially between human tgiflx and other orthologues .

full length protein sequence or near full-length protein sequence for tgif <dig>  tgif <dig> and tgiflx/y homologues were retrieved from ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov or ensembl http://www.ensembl.org. there are  <dig> tgif <dig> orthologues from various vertebrates and invertebrates,  <dig> tgif <dig> from various vertebrates and  <dig> tgiflx/y homologues from eutherians. phylogenetic analysis with phylip program clustered these homologues into two main clusters tgif1s and tgif2s . tgiflx/y orthologues branched with the tgif2s. tgif <dig> from all mammals including the tammar clustered tightly, with monotremes forming the most distant branch. tgif <dig> from reptiles, birds, amphibians and fish formed other branches. invertebrates including fly and mosquito clustered as a single branch. the biggest branch of the tgif <dig> cluster was the eutherian group, followed by the tgiflx/y cluster. tammar and opossum tgif <dig> formed a separate branch followed by monotreme, bird and reptile.

tammar bac clones were identified by screening the agi tammar bac library with the tgif <dig> probe. the bac clone showing homology to tammar tgif <dig>  was confirmed by pcr amplification. the clone was mapped to the long arm of tammar chromosome  <dig> by fluorescence in situ hybridization  . only one hybridization location was detected.

tammar tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> mrna distribution in the fetus and developing gonads
rt-pcr was performed to investigate the expression pattern of tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> in various fetal tissues during organogenesis. both tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> mrna were detected in all the examined tissues . tgif <dig> was ubiquitously expressed during early development. similarly, tgif <dig> was also expressed in all examined fetal tissues. tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> mrna transcripts were detected in gonads at all stages examined from the last two days of the  <dig>  day gestation to day  <dig> post partum .

tammar tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> mrna distribution in adult tissues
tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> expression was investigated in adult tissues including the adult testis and ovary. as in the human, tammar tgif <dig> was ubiquitously expressed in most adult tissues except the pancreas, stomach and epididymis. in contrast, tgif <dig> was only expressed in the adult gonads and was absent in all other tissues except the spleen . to further confirm our results, we performed semi-quantitative pcr . this further demonstrated that tgif <dig> has a broader expression pattern than tgif <dig> 

tammar tgif <dig> mrna and protein distribution during spermatogenesis
in the adult testis, using in situ hybridization tgif <dig> mrna was detected in the germ cells, predominantly in a layer around the seminiferous cord lumen . no mrna staining was detectable in the sertoli cells or interstitial cells. there was strong tgif <dig> mrna staining in round spermatids when they were just newly formed  and before transforming into elongated spermatids . after round spermatids started to elongate, staining decreased moderately but was still detectable in the cytoplasm of elongating/elongated spermatids and spermatocytes . no staining was detected when elongated spermatids transformed into mature spermatozoa and were released into lumen .

tgif <dig> protein was also restricted to the germ cells during spermatogenesis. when round spermatids were newly formed, tgif <dig> protein was present and there was strong staining in the cytoplasm of spermatids . after that, immunostaining decreased significantly to an almost undetectable level . at late stages of spermatid transformation, tgif <dig> was detected to the cytoplasm of germ cells surrounding the lumen . when the sperm tail was fully formed and released to the lumen, tgif <dig> protein was localized in the residual body and the mid-piece of sperm tail .

tammar tgif <dig> mrna distribution during folliculogenesis
in the adult ovary tgif <dig> mrna was detected in the granulosa cells and theca cells of the secondary follicles and tertiary follicles . there was no mrna detected in the primary follicles  and tgif <dig> was almost undetectable in the graafian follicle . there was no staining seen in the oocyte.

discussion
conservation of the tgif family in vertebrates
tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> share the highest degree of homology in the tgif family. the characterisation of tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> established that both genes have  <dig> exons in all species except the orthologue of tgif <dig> in drosophila. the conservation of tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> throughout the exons, the utr and flanking regions suggests the functional importance of these genes during evolution. the x-linked tgiflx is specific to the eutherian lineage and arose after they diverged from marsupials and monotremes around  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago respectively.

the entire tammar tgif <dig> protein shared 71% amino acid identity with human tgif <dig> and only 33% similarity with human tgiflx. the high degree of conservation over the homeodomain and tale regions suggests that tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> interactions via the homeodomain may be similar in marsupial as in human and mouse  <cit> . the third helix within the homeodomain, critical for dna binding, is the most conserved between eutherian and marsupial orthologues, suggesting they are likely to bind to the same dna motif as identified in the mouse  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses showed that the tgiflx groups tightly with the tgif <dig> branch, supporting the suggestion that tgiflx originated from a tgif <dig> retrotransposition event  <cit>  .

both tgif <dig> &tgif <dig> are important for embryonic and gonadal development
marsupial tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> mrna was expressed in all embryonic tissues examined, as in mice  <cit> . tammar tgif <dig> mrna was abundant in embryonic brain, consistent with the high level seen in the murine embryonic nervous system  <cit> . tammar tgif <dig> was observed in all examined tissues, again consistent with previous studies in mice, and there was abundant mrna expression in the brain  <cit> . in contrast, mouse tgif <dig> mrna transcripts were restricted in the brain from e <dig> indicating that tgif <dig> may be involved in cerebellum development and maturation  <cit> . the overlapping expression of these two genes and the phenotype of the tgif <dig> knockout mouse suggest that tgif <dig> can compensate for the loss of tgif <dig> during embryogenesis  <cit> . the ubiquitous expression of tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> in the tammar similarly suggests that both tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> may be functionally redundantly during marsupial embryogenesis.

differential function of tammar tgif <dig> and tgif <dig> in adult tissues
tammar tgif <dig> was broadly expressed in adult tissues including the testis, in similar locations to those described for the human and mouse  <cit> . mouse tgif <dig> is found in the nuclei of peripheral regions of tubules such as spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes in the adult testis  <cit> . murine tgif <dig> mrna transcripts are present and functional as transcriptional repressors in adult and embryonic tissues and have similar expression patterns  <cit> . similarly, tgif <dig> is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues  <cit> . in contrast, tammar tgif <dig> was exclusively expressed in the adult testis, ovary and spleen. the expression of tammar tgif <dig> in adult gonadal tissues is instead similar to that of human tgiflx and mouse tex <dig> that are expressed only in adult testis and are thought to be involved in spermatogenesis  <cit> . marsupial tgif <dig> was strongly expressed in round spermatids but appeared to be down-regulated as they transformed into elongated spermatids, identical to the tex <dig> expression pattern in mice  <cit> . tammar tgif <dig> protein was strongly detected in early round spermatids and in mature spermatids, and also detected in the residual bodies, in line with tex <dig> mrna distribution in mice  <cit> . since tgiflx is undetectable in some humans with abnormal spermatogenesis, tgiflx is likely to have a function in male reproduction and development  <cit> . therefore, the expression pattern of marsupial tgif <dig> and its specific localisation in the germ cells during spermatogenesis suggests that tgif <dig> has developed a specialised function in marsupial germ cells.

the mrna of tammar tgif <dig> was examined in the adult ovary and was detected primarily in the granulosa cells in developing ovarian follicles, predominantly in secondary and tertiary follicles, suggesting that tgif <dig> may also function in folliculogenesis and the development of oocyte. this is the first examination of tgif <dig> in ovaries of any mammal. tgif <dig> was also detected in the thecal cells, known to be critical for follicular function  <cit> .

evolution of the tgif family from fly to human: specialised function in sex and reproduction?
the mammalian x-chromosome is known to contain a disproportionate number of genes involved in testis and brain function  <cit> . this is thought to have evolved due to direct selection of male advantage genes on the hemizygous ×  <cit> . whether x-linked genes are more likely to evolve testis functions or testicular genes are more likely to be relocated to the × remains to be tested. the marsupial x-chromosome is the smallest × in mammals and is most similar to the x-chromosome of the therian ancestor  <cit> . in the eutherian lineage the × has been expanded, mainly by the addition of two large autosomal blocks from the therian ancestor. these two large additions are autosomal in the marsupial and non-mammalian vertebrate lineages  <cit> . tgiflx maps to the conserved region of the x-chromosome, present in all therian mammals, but was absent on the marsupial x-chromosome. eutherian tgiflx was not part of the two large autosomal additions but arose via retrotransposition, presumably from tgif <dig>  <cit> . once on the eutherian x-chromosome it was exposed to positive selection that favours the evolution of male reproductive advantage genes  <cit> , possibly leading to its specialisation in the adult testis. the accelerated rate of tgiflx evolution therefore appears to be due its location on the × and its potentially redundant function with its progenitor tgif <dig>  <cit> . despite the autosomal location of tammar tgif <dig>  it too has a specialised role in the adult marsupial in spermatogenesis and possibly folliculogenesis. the conflicting expression profiles of tgif <dig> in adult marsupials and eutherians make it impossible to determine if the ancestral tgif <dig> orthologue was a broadly expressed gene in the adult or was gonad-specific. there is good evidence that the × selectively retains translocated testis-specific genes that may confer a male advantage  <cit> . thus the ancestral tgif <dig> may have already had a function in mammalian spermatogenesis before a translocated copy moved to the × in eutherians. due to the new tgifx orthologue now fulfilling the testicular function, autosomal tgif <dig> was able to diversify and take on broader functions in the adult. this suggestion is supported by the similar degree of functional specialisation in reproduction from the autosomal copy of tgif <dig> in marsupials, demonstrating that a location on the sex chromosome is not the only the driving force behind the rapid specialisation of this gene in spermatogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that tammar tgif <dig> had a similar expression pattern to that of eutherians  <cit> , but tgif <dig> has a restricted expression pattern, very similar to that of eutherian tgiflx/tex <dig>  since tgiflx and its orthologues are only present in the eutherian lineage, the retrotransposition event resulting in its creation must have occurred after the marsupial-eutherian divergence between  <dig> and 148mya  <cit>  but before ~ <dig> mya when the primate-rodent lineages split  <cit> . the germ cell specific expression of marsupial tgif <dig> in adult testes suggests it may have a role in spermatogenesis, similar to that of tgiflx/tex <dig> in eutherian mammals and of the tgif genes in drosophila. tgif <dig> expression was shown for the first time in follicles and oocytes so it is likely that it also has a role in folliculogenesis. together these data suggest that there has been an ultra-conserved function for the tgif family in fertility and that tgif <dig> already had specialised role in the adult, in spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis long before its retrotransposition in eutherian mammals.
