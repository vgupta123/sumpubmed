BACKGROUND
fungi are exposed to different external abiotic factors during their life cycle. like almost every organism, fungi can adapt to the abiotic factor light by considerable adjustments of their physiology, including metabolic processes  <cit> . light has an effect on almost all metabolic pathways in fungi, such as carotenoid metabolism  <cit> , fatty acid metabolism  <cit> , camp levels  <cit> , sulfur metabolism  <cit>  and carbohydrate metabolism  <cit> . it was reported already more than  <dig> years ago that consuming available nutrients and sensing of light are connected - it depends on the carbon source if light exerts a stimulating effect on growth rates . the number of genes regulated in response to light ranges from only one in cryptococcus neoformans  <cit>  to several hundred in neurospora crassa  and trichoderma atroviride  up to 5% of the whole genome in aspergillus nidulans  <cit> .

due to the immobility of a fungus, the signal transduction system is important for survival under changing environmental conditions  <cit> . being crucial for successful competition in nature, transmission of nutrient signals can be considered responsible for integration with light signaling, resulting in adjustment of the growth rate in light and darkness to environmental conditions. one prominent mechanism for achievement of this task is the heterotrimeric g-protein signaling pathway  <cit> , which is interconnected with the light response pathway in trichoderma reesei  <cit> .

trichoderma reesei  was discovered in the 1940s and this fungus is most prominent for its ability to produce cellulases. these enzymes are used in various biotechnological processes, such as in the textile industry, food and feed industry  <cit>  and heterologous protein production  <cit> . despite its long history of use for research and industry, sexual development under laboratory conditions was only recently achieved  <cit>  and only a few details on the mechanism and regulation of mating in t. reesei are available so far  <cit> . concerns about the consumption of fossil fuels, the co <dig> balance and imminent climate change prompted increased research efforts towards second generation biofuels and hence towards improved cellulase production. the sequence analysis of the genome of t. reesei reveals that the genome comprises  <dig> hemicellulase genes and nine cellulase genes - surprisingly low numbers for the currently most important cellulase producer worldwide  <cit> . induction and regulation of the genes responsible for this industrial application have been studied for decades  <cit> . however, the impact of signal transduction pathways on biosynthesis of degradative enzymes and their responsiveness to light only recently received attention  <cit> .

albeit unexpected for an important biotechnological workhorse, several trichoderma species were used as photomorphogenic models  <cit>  and since the discovery of light modulated cellulase gene expression  <cit>  the interrelationship between metabolic functions and light response became a focus of research. like many other metabolic processes, the production of cellulases is influenced by light and the light regulatory protein envoy as well as the two photoreceptors blr <dig> and blr <dig>  in t. reesei  <cit> . investigation of the transmission of environmental signals by the g-protein alpha subunits revealed an effect of this signaling pathway on cellulase gene expression. the signals transmitted by both gna <dig> and gna <dig> have a positive impact on cellulase gene expression, which is dependent on light  <cit> . the fact that these g alpha subunits are involved in light modulated cellulase gene transcription raises the question, as to how the light signal could be transferred to and/or integrated with the nutrient signal transmitted via the heterotrimeric g-protein pathway. in t. reesei several regulatory mechanisms impacting heterotrimeric g-protein signaling are present  <cit> .

a light-dependent function for phosducin-like proteins has previously been shown in higher eukaryotes: phosducins  were first isolated in photoreceptor cells of the retina of mammals  <cit> , where they act as regulators of g-protein signaling  <cit> . among the three classes of phosducins and phosducin-like proteins , phosducins of class i play a role in the g beta-gamma binding  <cit>  by acting as co-chaperones in their folding and are required for efficient g-protein signaling  <cit> . knock-out mutants of class ii phosducins in saccharomyces cerevisiae were not able to survive, suggesting that class ii phosducins are essential for cell growth  <cit> . phds and phlps of class iii are assumed to play a role in actin folding  <cit> . in fungi the function of phosducin-like proteins in g-protein beta-gamma assembly was confirmed  <cit> . disruption of the cryphonectria parasitica class i phosducin bdm- <dig> impacts on the accumulation of the g alpha subunit cpg- <dig>  <cit>  and is a probable casein kinase  <dig> target  <cit> . the aspergillus nidulans phosducin homologue phna was shown to be involved in regulation of the sterigmatocystin biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . nevertheless, a related function in light response in fungi has not been explored so far. the genome of t. reesei comprises two genes encoding phosducin-like proteins of classes i and ii, both of which have orthologues in several other fungi, including aspergilli and neurospora  <cit> . besides the phosducin-like proteins, also microbial opsins as g-protein coupled receptors can be considered promising candidates for connecting components between nutrient and light signaling  <cit> . however, in the t. reesei genome no microbial opsins were detected  <cit> .

our study revealed that class i phosducin-like proteins are involved in transmission of light-dependent signals in fungi. transcription of phlp <dig> was responsive to light and phlp <dig> acted in the same pathway as the g-protein beta and gamma subunits gnb <dig> and gng <dig>  genome wide transcriptional analysis showed considerable light dependent gene regulation, especially of glycoside hydrolase genes, which was at least in part mediated by phlp <dig>  we identified a broad positive influence of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> on gene expression in light, suggesting sustainment of predominantly nutritional processes by this signaling pathway in light. moreover, we found that phlp <dig> positively regulated transcript levels of the peptide pheromone precursor hpp <dig> as well as of the homologue of the yeast pheromone transporter gene ste <dig> and consequently impacted on mating efficiency.

RESULTS
genome-wide analysis of light-dependent transcription in t. reesei
to gain an overview on light-dependent physiological processes in t. reesei, genome wide transcriptional analysis using microarrays was applied . t. reesei was grown on microcrystalline cellulose for  <dig> hours in constant light and constant darkness, since the fungus is in its active phase of growth and enzyme production at this time. constant conditions were chosen in order to avoid interference of circadian rhythmicity with our results. as internal controls we checked genes with known transcriptional patterns under these conditions  <cit> . transcription of the light regulatory protein encoding env <dig>  the photolyase gene phr <dig> and the peptide pheromone precursor encoding gene hpp <dig> correlated with earlier data under similar conditions and hence confirm that growth conditions were appropriate for our analysis. additionally we tested whether the microarray results reflected actual expression patterns in the sample by qrt-pcr of the two major cellulase genes cel7a/cbh <dig> and cel6a/cbh <dig>  while transcript abundance of cel7a/cbh <dig> exceeded the saturation threshold  of the arrays and could thus not be used as an internal control for appropriate cultivation conditions, transcriptional patterns of the cellulase gene cel6a/cbh <dig>  correlated with qrt-pcr data. for both cel7a/cbh <dig> and cel6a/cbh <dig> clear correlation with earlier data  <cit>  was observed .

t. reesei showed considerable alterations in gene regulation in dependence on the light status .  <dig> genes  were found to be at least two-fold differentially regulated under these conditions, which is in the range of light regulated genes found in other ascomycetes  <cit> . gene set enrichment analysis  was used to elucidate which processes were specifically enhanced or decreased in light . as expected, genes representing functions in dna photolyase activity were significantly enriched among the genes upregulated in light. surprisingly, we found significant enrichment  of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolic processes  =  <dig> ), cellulase activity and cellulose binding , regulation of oxidoreductase activity  and sulphate transport  in this group. these results were in agreement with earlier data on light-modulated cellulase gene expression  <cit>  and an interconnection with sulphate metabolism and light response in t. reesei  <cit> . in contrast, genes involved in lipid biosynthetic processes  and transport processes  were downregulated in light.

specifically, among the group of  <dig> genes, which were at least two-fold upregulated in constant light, we found eight genes involved in sexual development , hence supporting the requirement of light for this process  <cit> . considering the biotechnological significance of t. reesei in production of cellulolytic enzymes, detection of  <dig> glycoside hydrolase  genes, which were upregulated in light, supports the hypothesis of a high importance of light in regulation of extracellular substrate degradation . those gh-genes included the two major cellulase genes cel7a/cbh <dig> and cel6a/cbh <dig>  the endoglucanase cel5a/egl <dig>  the xylanase xyn <dig> and the beta-xylosidase bxl <dig>  interestingly, we also found transcription of cel61a/egl <dig> and an additional gh-family  <dig> gene to be decreased in constant light, suggesting that t. reesei adjusts its cellulase mixture to different physiological requirements in light and darkness.

the class i phosducin-like protein is responsive to light
the widespread influence of light on glycoside hydrolase gene expression suggested a close interconnection between light response and nutrient signaling, which was also corroborated by our studies on g-protein signaling  <cit> . as regulators of g-protein signaling, class i phosducin-like proteins, which are involved in transmission of light signals in higher eukaryotes  <cit> , represent viable candidates as nodes between the pathways transmitting light and nutrient signals.

we therefore first tested short-term light responsiveness of the class i phosducin-like protein encoding gene phlp <dig> . phlp <dig> was significantly induced by light after  <dig> minutes of exposure  and also upregulated in light upon growth on cellulose and long term light exposure . in n. crassa  <cit>  and a. nidulans  <cit>  orthologues of phlp <dig> were not found among light regulated genes. following the definition by chen and co-workers  <cit> , phlp <dig> belongs to the group of late light responsive genes . this classification hints to a function of phlp <dig> also upon prolonged cultivation in light, i. e. under constant conditions of growth on cellulose in light or darkness. indeed, transcript abundance of phlp <dig> is increased in light after  <dig> h of growth compared to darkness .

the sequence of a light response element , which is a probable binding site for the wcc complex in n. crassa, was identified  <dig> bp upstream of the translational start codon. the core region of an elre  defined by chen  <cit>  superposes this element. this fact supports a light responsive role for phlp <dig> in t. reesei. however, the light responsive element  described by  <cit>  does not entirely correspond to the motif identified by he  <cit>  and was not detected in the  <dig> kb promotor region of phlp <dig>  accordingly, the phlp <dig> orthologue of n. crassa was not found to be a target of the white collar complex  <cit> .

class i phosducin like proteins are supposed to act as co-chaperones for g-protein beta and gamma subunit folding  <cit> . in contrast to phlp <dig>  transcript abundance of the genes encoding the g-protein beta and gamma subunits  showed only a small short term response to illumination on glycerol and no change under constant long-term conditions in light compared to darkness whilst grown on cellulose . to gain insight into the mechanism of light regulation of phlp <dig>  we analyzed transcript ratios of phlp <dig> in the photoreceptor mutants Δblr <dig>  Δblr <dig> and Δenv <dig>  under constant conditions of growth on cellulose. deletion of env <dig> caused a significant increase in light responsiveness of phlp <dig> transcription  compared to the parental strain qm <dig> . in contrast, lack of blr <dig> or blr <dig> resulted in only minor differences of transcript abundance compared to wild type, which does not corroborate binding of a photoreceptor complex to the lre motif in the phlp <dig> promotor. however, in the respective mutants the detected differences between light and darkness lack statistical significance , which may be interpreted as abolished light response. hence, although a certain influence of the photoreceptors blr <dig> and blr <dig> on transcription of phlp <dig> was observed, the function of env <dig> in regulation of phlp <dig> is likely more relevant with respect to light response.

deletion mutants of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> display similar phenotypes
to confirm the hypothesis that phlp <dig> is involved in the g-protein signaling pathway by acting on the g beta and the g gamma subunits, we constructed deletion mutants of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig>  and gng <dig> . phenotypes of Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> in constant darkness  and constant light  revealed largely similar growth patterns of the three deletion mutant strains, which clearly differed from the parental strain qm <dig> . evaluation of the number of spores revealed increased sporulation in light in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> strains and a minor decrease in Δphlp <dig> in darkness . lack of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> or gng <dig> caused decreased hyphal extension rates and biomass formation under all conditions tested including cellulose .

these data suggest a carbon source and light-independent decrease of biomass formation and hence a light-independent growth defect upon lack of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> or gng <dig>  the strikingly similar phenotypes of strains lacking phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> support the expected function of phlp <dig> in efficient folding of gnb <dig> and the hypothesis that phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> act in the same pathway.

lack of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> or gng <dig> causes considerable loss of regulatory control in light
to determine if phlp <dig> and its regulatory targets gnb <dig> and gng <dig> would function as a node between the light response pathway and nutrient signaling via the heterotrimeric g-protein cascade, we applied genome wide transcriptional analysis of Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> in light and darkness. we chose cultivation under constant conditions  with cellulose as carbon source, as expression of plant cell wall degrading enzymes mainly produced on cellulose represents the best studied output pathway in t. reesei. the function of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> could be on the one hand regulation of light responsiveness  of gene expression, which we describe as the difference between transcript abundance in light compared to darkness in the same strain . on the other hand, alteration of gene expression in the mutant strains compared to the parental strain is important for determination of the  regulatory targets of the function of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> 

because of the presumed function of phlp <dig> in light response, we first investigated the influence of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> on light responsiveness of gene expression. analysis of transcript profiles in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> indicated that these genes are crucial for regulation of light responsiveness on gene expression. in these strains not only the roughly 3% of genes were regulated in response to light as in the parental strain qm <dig>  but this number considerably increased up to 23% of all genes in Δgnb <dig> . interestingly, the most striking difference was the high number of genes downregulated in light compared to darkness, which suggests that several processes maintained or regulated by phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> in the parental strain in light might not be initiated or enhanced further in their absence, because the light signal does not reach the target. we conclude that the signal transduction components and their output pathways, which trigger regulation of physiological processes, are different in light than in darkness. as candidates for the respective targets we identified glycoside hydrolases, of which up to  <dig>  were downregulated in contrast to two in the parental strain in light, and also components of sulphur metabolism with up to  <dig> genes downregulated in this strain in contrast to none in the qm <dig> strain .

light regulation of glycoside hydrolases is prevalent in t. reesei
in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> the number of glycoside hydrolases genes differentially regulated in light and darkness was even higher than in the parental strain. while gh encoding genes upregulated in qm <dig> are in no case regulated contrarily in the mutants , many gh-encoding genes show lower transcript levels in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> than in qm <dig> , which indicates that phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> are involved in triggering their expression specifically in light. intriguingly, only in  <dig> out of  <dig> gh-families represented in the t. reesei genome, no member was found to be regulated light-dependently in any of the strains tested, among which only the functionalities of rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase , beta-galactosidase  and a-n-acetylglucosaminidase  are not available within any other gh family.

in total we found  <dig> gh-encoding genes out of  <dig> in the genome to be regulated by light in the parental strain qm <dig> and/or one or more mutant strains. hence these genes can be expected to be potentially regulated in response to light and to a nutrient signal as transmitted via the heterotrimeric g-protein pathway. these results are in accordance with earlier studies revealing that the influence of light on growth of a fungus is dependent on the provided carbon source  <cit> . tight regulation of the enzymes required for carbon source utilization in response to light is expected to be required for this mechanism, which is likely to involve the function of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> 

regulatory targets of phlp1
as lack of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> revealed considerable light dependent regulation by these factors, we were interested, whether their function is a positive or negative one and if illumination would be relevant for their impact. to this end we compared transcript abundance of genes in mutants with their parental strain upon growth under constant conditions as described above. this analysis allowed us to identify targets of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> , which might directly or indirectly be involved in light-adaptive processes and regulation of output pathways such as glycoside hydrolase gene expression in t. reesei . investigation of the targets of phlp <dig> revealed  <dig> genes to be upregulated at least two-fold in Δphlp <dig> in light compared to the parental strain . among these were hfb <dig>  and hfb <dig>  - two genes encoding class ii hydrophobins and six glycoside hydrolase family proteins. however, the number of genes positively influenced by phlp <dig> in light was considerably higher.  <dig> genes were downregulated at least two-fold in the phlp <dig> deletion strain . in addition to  <dig> glycoside hydrolase family genes, we found  <dig> g-protein coupled receptor proteins in this group , of which  <dig> belonged to the pth11-like gpcrs reported to play a role in pathogenesis of magnaporthe grisea  <cit> .

in darkness, transcript abundance of  <dig> genes was enhanced in the Δphlp <dig> mutant including two glycoside hydrolase family  <dig> genes, which encode mannosidases and five other candidates for glycoside hydrolases . moreover, a class ii hydrophobin gene hfb <dig>  as well as ooc <dig>  which is related to cellulase transcription  <cit>  were found to be targets of phlp <dig>  only  <dig> genes were downregulated in Δphlp <dig> in darkness and most of them overlap with those downregulated in light .  <dig> genes were significantly downregulated in both light and darkness in the Δphlp <dig> strain compared to the parental strain qm <dig> and hence represent light-independent targets of phlp <dig> . interestingly these targets included rgs <dig> , a g-protein signaling regulator encoding gene and a gene encoding a gprk-type gpcr , which also comprises an rgs domain.

overlapping targets of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng1
for evaluation of the hypothesis that gnb <dig>  gng <dig> and phlp <dig> are acting in the same pathway and to elucidate the regulatory output of the respective interactions, we analyzed the target genes common to these components . such genes would reflect a function of all three proteins - presumably due to their complex formation or a tight regulation of each other - in regulation of the respective target genes.

in light, we detected a  <dig> %  overlap of all upregulated genes and  <dig> %  overlap of all downregulated genes in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> . in darkness  <dig> genes were upregulated in all three mutants, including two glycoside hydrolases , one putative pth11-like gpcr , a hydrophobin gene hfb <dig> , a gene involved in conidiation  and one polyketide synthase . seven genes - among them are rgs <dig>  a gene encoding a regulator of g-protein signaling, and a putative g-protein coupled receptor comprising an rgs-domain  - were downregulated in darkness.

gene regulation in the individual mutant strains was more similar between Δphlp <dig> and Δgng <dig> than between Δphlp <dig> and Δgnb <dig> for both up- and downregulated genes in light . most interestingly, among the  <dig> genes downregulated in light in all mutant strains, again rgs <dig> was found to be downregulated . since the positive effect of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> on  <dig> genes in light was the most important effect, we conclude that this group comprises the most crucial target genes of g-protein beta-gamma signaling.

as expected based on the results described above, the predominant functional group within  <dig> positive targets in light were the glycoside hydrolases with  <dig> target genes . additionally,  <dig> pth11-type gpcr encoding genes , and one gprk-type gpcr containing an rgs-domain ,  <dig> hydrophobin genes hfb <dig> and hfb <dig> , a polyketide synthase group  <dig> encoding gene  and two non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes , two putative multicopper oxidase genes  as well as six putative transcription factors  were found to be targets of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig>  interestingly, downregulation of four genes  was found to be independent of the light status.

we conclude that the phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> complex impacts signal perception by g-protein coupled receptors, transmission and termination of the signals by regulation of g-protein alpha subunit activity, transcriptional activity of target genes and hence the output in terms of carbohydrate utilization and secondary metabolism.

phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> regulate cellulase gene expression
since our genome wide analysis revealed a crucial function of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> in regulation of hydrolytic enzymes, we investigated the subset of these genes responsible for degradation of cellulosic substrates in more detail. in addition to cel7a/cbh <dig>  for seven out of nine cellulases , cel7b/egl <dig>  , cel5a/egl <dig>  , cel12a/egl <dig>  , cel45a/egl <dig>  , cel74a/egl <dig>  , cel61b ), including a gene encoding a cellulase enhancing protein of gh family  <dig>  we observed a positive effect of light on transcript levels in at least one of the strains tested, which is reduced in the Δphlp <dig> and Δgng <dig> deletion strains, as was observed for cel7a/cbh <dig> . a negative effect of light was not detected for any cellulase gene. moreover, in total eleven out of  <dig> hemicellulase genes  <cit>  are differentially regulated at least two-fold in light and darkness in qm <dig> and/or the mutant strains .

qrt-pcr analysis of transcription of cel7a/cbh <dig> showed consistently decreased levels in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> in light compared to the parental strain qm <dig>  . transcription abundance in the deletion strains was not only observed in light, but also in darkness. in particular, in the Δphlp <dig> strain transcript levels were reduced by  <dig> % +-  <dig> %, in the Δgng <dig> strain by  <dig> % +-  <dig> % and in the Δgnb <dig> strain even by  <dig> % +-  <dig> % compared to qm <dig> in darkness. considering the positive effect of gna <dig> and gna <dig> on cellulase expression  <cit> , this result is in accordance with a positive effect of phosducin-like proteins on the efficiency of g-protein signaling  <cit> . analysis of specific cellulase activity in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> revealed increased efficiency of the cellulase mixtures secreted by these strains as compared to the parental strain , hence reflecting posttranscriptional regulation of cellulase gene expression as was suggested previously  <cit> . consequently, phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> are important for regulation of cellulase gene expression by the heterotrimeric g-protein pathway. however, the function of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> in regulation of cellulase gene expression is not dependent on light.

phlp <dig> is a regulator of pheromone expression
targets of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> were found to include genes involved in sexual development, with the peptide pheromone precursor gene hpp <dig>  <cit>  and the homologue of the yeast pheromone transporter gene ste <dig>  as most interesting representatives. ste <dig> is involved in the secretion process of an a-type pheromone in schizophyllum commune  <cit>  and was shown to be required but not essential for mating in cryptococcus neoformans  <cit> . the protein encoded by tr_ <dig> shows homology to c. neoformans ste <dig> with coverage of 91% and an e-value of 3e- <dig> .

evaluation of microarray data by qrt-pcr confirmed considerably decreased transcript levels of hpp <dig> in Δphlp <dig> and co-regulation of hpp <dig> with ste <dig> in Δphlp <dig> and Δgng <dig> . the data indicated that in darkness the pheromone precursor was downregulated to a basal level in all strains tested, confirming the importance of light for sexual reproduction  <cit> . expression levels of hpp <dig> were significantly decreased in light in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig>  with lack of phlp <dig> causing a decrease even to dark levels. transcription of ste <dig> was enhanced upon deletion of gnb <dig>  which might reflect a reaction to the decreased pheromone levels.

this influence of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> on the pheromone precursor and transporter of the corresponding pheromone in submerged culture on cellulose prompted us to analyze sexual development under conditions appropriate for reproduction i. e. on solid medium . despite considerably decreased transcript levels of hpp <dig> and ste <dig> in the Δphlp <dig> strain in shake flasks on cellulose, this strain was still able to produce fruiting bodies. however, the amount of fruiting bodies formed by Δphlp <dig> after  <dig> days was significantly lowered by 39% . since the function of gnb <dig> and gng <dig> is likely to be considerably affected by phlp <dig>  a role also for these factors in sexual development was expected. in Δgnb <dig>  and Δgng <dig>  no statistically significant decrease in fruiting body formation was observed. additionally we found that in Δphlp <dig> ascospore discharge was reduced by  <dig> %  and virtually abolished in Δgnb <dig> . these results suggest a role for phlp <dig> in development of female sexual structures and in reproductive efficiency.

discussion
the changing conditions between day and night or growth on the surface and in substrate require considerable physiological adjustments, the significance of which is so far poorly understood. especially the differences in carbon source utilization and expression of the enzymes produced for this task in light and darkness are of utmost interest for both research and industry. in this study we investigated gene expression under conditions triggering production of plant cell wall degrading enzymes, the most important research focus of t. reesei. constant conditions of illumination are used to reveal an influence of light especially on metabolic processes, while largely avoiding interference with circadian rhythmicity, which would be effective under the more natural conditions of 12: <dig> light-dark cycles. the analysis of short term light responsiveness of transcription of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig>  complemented long term light exposure experiments .

we elucidated the function of an important node between the light response pathway and nutrient signaling. our results strongly point at a positive effect of the phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> complex on a broad array of genes in light. while a strong impact of such a central signaling mechanism is not surprising, the huge amount of downregulated  genes in light was unexpected. this finding supports a model in which distinct mechanisms are responsible for regulation of physiological processes in darkness and in light, with phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> playing an important role for transmission of signals relevant to expression of hydrolytic enzymes and proteins involved in sexual reproduction in light . it may be even more astonishing that at least 23% of all genes can be regulated in a light dependent manner, as shown for strains lacking one of the signaling genes, an effect which was masked in the parental strain by tight regulation.

however, our results indicate that the pathway of heterotrimeric g-protein signaling represents an interactive regulatory network for signal transmission: among the genes not upregulated in light in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> there were three g-protein coupled receptors and one regulator of g-protein signaling . this finding could explain how the different relevance of signals in light and darkness as reported earlier for t. reesei  <cit>  can result in altered regulation of output pathways. signals integrated at the regulatory level of the g-protein beta and gamma subunits may adjust sensitivity of the organism to environmental signals by regulating the respective receptor. transmission of a certain set of signals is modulated by an effect on rgs <dig> by action on the activity of different g-protein alpha subunits  <cit> .

interestingly, as seen for Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig>  biomass formation in gna1ql, a strain that expresses a constitutively activated g-protein alpha subunit  is also reduced  <cit> . identification of possible target genes of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> revealed rgs <dig> and a gpcr, containing an rgs domain,  as light independent targets. rgs proteins are regulators of g-proteins by activating the gtpase function and thereby control the g alpha activity negatively  <cit> . in t. reesei the number of genes comprising these functionalities is high  compared to one rgs-protein in n. crassa  <cit>  or  <dig> rgs-proteins and one gprk-type gpcr in a. nidulans  <cit> . in accordance with our results, a study of the phosducin-like protein phna in aspergillus nidulans showed a function of phna in regulation of the rgs protein flba, which controls the vegetative growth signaling pathway mediated by the g beta and gamma subunits  <cit> . since deletion of phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> or gng <dig> decreased the abundance of the rgs <dig> transcript and hence could lead to enhanced activity of gna <dig>  that is in agreement with our data and the hypothesis raised previously  <cit>  that the growth defect observed upon alteration of gna <dig> might at least in part be due to the function of the g-protein beta and gamma subunits.

an interesting question with respect to light dependent regulation of plant cell wall degrading enzymes  is the correlation between growth rate of the fungus and biosynthesis of extracellular protein. the most elaborate studies on this topic in t. reesei were done under constant  fermentation conditions: it was shown that upon growth under carbon limiting conditions with lactose as carbon source, slow growth correlates with high specific rates of extracellular protein synthesis  <cit> . however, the same study revealed that despite efficient synthesis of the major cellulase cel7a/cbh <dig> at low growth rates, the protein secretion capacity limits protein production under these conditions. in terms of physiology, this phenomenon can be explained by the need to use hydrolytic enzymes to increase nutrient supply from insoluble extracellular substrates. several studies showed an initial increase of extracellular protein production with increasing dilution rate and a decrease after reaching a peak was observed  <cit> .

studies using cellulose as carbon source and shake flasks for cultivation also do not provide a consistently direct correlation between growth rate and transcription of glycoside hydrolase genes: growth and transcription of cel7a/cbh <dig> in the wild type strain qm <dig> were in accordance with an indirect correlation between growth rate and cellulase transcription, as the lower growth rate of t. reesei in light is correlated with higher transcript levels of cel7a/cbh <dig>  <cit> . since growth has been shown to represent an output pathway of light signaling  <cit>  and the t. reesei photoreceptors blr <dig> and blr <dig> influence growth as well as cellulase gene expression  <cit> , this connection is not surprising.

in the present genome wide study, we found both positive and negative light dependent regulation of an unexpectedly high number of glycoside hydrolases in qm <dig> and mutant strains. having in mind that the difference in growth observed in qm <dig> between light and darkness was not similarly clear in the mutant strains, a strict correlation of glycoside hydrolase gene expression with growth rate cannot be proposed from the data of our study. moreover, the fact that both positive and negative regulation of glycoside hydrolase genes in response to light was observed, refutes the hypothesis that the negative effect of light on the growth rate correlates with a consistently positive effect on transcription of glycoside hydrolase genes. also, we found decreased, but still light-dependent regulation of transcript abundance of cel7a/cbh <dig> in Δphlp <dig>  Δgnb <dig> and Δgng <dig> , although growth was less or not at all influenced by light in these strains. consequently, we propose a model in which phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig> represent crucial components of the pathway connecting light signaling to regulation of growth, which would explain the uncoupling of cel7a/cbh <dig> transcription from the growth rate. alternatively, our data could indicate that the correlation of cel7a/cbh <dig> transcription with the growth rate is a specific event under the clearly defined conditions used in previous experiments, but not a general phenomenon. likewise, an extrapolation of these findings to glycoside hydrolases in general would require a consistently indirect correlation of growth rate and transcription of glycoside hydrolase genes, which is clearly not the case. therefore the assumption that transcription of glycoside hydrolase genes generally increases at lower growth rates is not supported. our data rather point at a sophisticated adjustment of glycoside hydrolase gene expression by up- and downregulation of certain groups which is triggered by phlp <dig>  gnb <dig> and gng <dig>  while we found growth to be regulated in response to light in any case, we could not obtain conclusive evidence that this might be achieved exclusively by regulation of substrate degradation efficiency  in t. reesei, but must  be governed by other pathways.

the positive influence of phlp <dig> on ste <dig> and hpp <dig> transcription added another piece of the puzzle to the regulatory mechanisms in g-protein signaling. the decreased fruiting body formation  and ascospore discharge  in the phlp <dig> deletion strain corresponds with the lower transcript levels of hpp <dig> and ste <dig> in this strain, as it was shown that hpp <dig> is necessary for male fertility in t. reesei qm <dig>  <cit> . this result reflects a crucial role of phlp <dig> in sexual development, which is in accordance with the function of its orthologue in a. nidulans  <cit> . nevertheless, the mating defect of the strain lacking gnb <dig> was even more severe, but with virtually abolished ascospore discharge concerns a different aspect of mating. although our study was focused on elucidation of the interrelationship between light response and nutrient signaling, the fact that sexual development of t. reesei is dependent on light  <cit>  draws a logical connection of these signaling pathways to sexual development. accordingly, in schizosaccharomyces pombe the nutrient regulated g-protein camp pathway and the pheromone regulated map kinase signaling pathway are interconnected and hence mating is also controlled by the availability of nutrients in this fungus . an involvement of the g-protein beta subunit in sexual development is also known from other fungi. in n. crassa it was shown that the deletion of the gene encoding the g-protein beta subunit gnb- <dig> results in a female sterile, but male fertile strain with small perithecia and no ascospore ejection  <cit> . in aspergillus nidulans lack of the g-beta subunit caused an increase in hülle cell formation, which supports fruiting body formation, but no cleistothecia could be found  <cit>  and in the basidiomycete cryptococcus neoformans g-protein beta is required for haploid fruiting and fertility  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, with phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> we could identify a further step in the signaling cascade aimed at light-modulated cellulase gene expression . thereby the targets among substrate degrading enzymes  are more widespread than expected. the considerable number of glycoside hydrolases showing differential transcription between light and darkness, which is in many cases subject to regulation by phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig>  reflects the high significance of light for fungi also in terms of substrate degradation. interestingly, also g-protein coupled receptors and regulators of g-protein function  are among the targets of phlp1-gnb1-gng <dig> - which can be considered to act somewhat at the downstream end of the g-protein pathway. hence we conclude that the pathway of heterotrimeric g-protein signaling does not strictly act as a cascade but rather represents an interactive network for signal integration and transmission. a function of phlp <dig> and gnb <dig> also in mating efficiency confirms phlp <dig> and its immediate targets as crucial nodes in adjusting the physiology of t. reesei to the central determinants of life in nature: the rotation of earth, acquisition of nutrients and reproduction.
