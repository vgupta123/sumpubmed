BACKGROUND
small regulatory peptides, a growing class of signaling molecules mediating cell-cell communication, are essential for plant growth, development and responses to environmental stimuli . the cle  peptide family is one of the well-studied peptide families in plants. the cle genes have been found in many plant species and some plant parasitic nematodes, while the functions of most cle genes are still unknown . however, accumulated data have revealed that cle genes played vital roles in stem cell homeostasis of different types of plant meristems including the sam , the ram , the vascular meristem  and the root nodule meristems  .

other than their roles in stem cell homoeostasis, cle genes have been found to participate in a range of biological processes . atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  and atcle <dig>  for example, were predominantly expressed in the arabidopsis root pericycle, and their expressions were induced under nitrogen-deficient conditions  <cit> . over-expression of atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  and atcle <dig> repressed the emergence and growth of lateral roots, which required clv <dig>  suggesting that clv <dig> mediated a nitrogen-responsive cle peptide signaling pathway that negatively regulated later root development under nitrogen deficiency  <cit> . atcle <dig> is specifically expressed in the endosperm and young embryos  <cit> . the mutation of atcle <dig> caused smaller and defective seeds/embryos, while ectopic expression of the atcle <dig> gene resulted in larger seeds/embryos, indicating that atcle <dig> played crucial roles in embryogenesis and endosperm development  <cit> . overexpression of hgcle <dig>  a cle-like nematode gene, resulted in a wus-like phenotype and a short-root phenotype. consistently, overexpression of hgcle <dig> rescued the clv3- <dig> mutant phenotype  <cit> . further studies have shown that multiple receptors, including clv <dig>  rpk <dig>  crn/sol <dig> and clv <dig>  are required for the successful nematode infection of arabidopsis roots  <cit> .

it has been shown that a number of cle genes, including atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  atcle <dig>  atcle41/tdif and atcle <dig>  played roles in vascular development  <cit> . in particular, exogenous application of atcle41/tdif peptides inhibited xylem vessel differentiation, but had no effect on the sam and/or ram development. consistently, over-expression of atcle41/tdif resulted in a xylem vessel strand-discontinuous phenotype in a pxy/tdr-dependent manner  <cit> . intriguingly, both over-expression and exogenous peptide application promoted cambial cell proliferation  <cit> . in combination, the data suggested that atcle41/tdif promoted the proliferation of vascular cambium cells while preventing them from differentiating into xylem through the tdr/pxy receptor  <cit> . recently, it has been suggested that the atcle41/tdif-pxy/tdr signaling module is evolutionarily conserved on regulating the secondary growth in poplar tree species  <cit> . by tissue-specific over-expression of pttcle <dig> and pttpxy genes, etchells and colleagues  generated poplar trees that exhibited enhanced growth and increased wood formation  <cit> .

poplar has been proposed as a model plant in understanding the molecular basis of tree growth and development, particularly the formation of wood which is commercially used for manufacturing, such as fuel and construction materials  <cit> . however, little is known about cle genes in this economically important tree species. as the conservation of their fundamental roles in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of meristematic tissues, particularly the cambium, as well as other cellular processes, it is of great interest to study the cle gene family in poplar, with an focus on cle genes exhibiting expression in vascular tissues which might be important for wood formation. with the availability of the genome sequence of poplar , we carried out a genome-wide analysis to identify cle genes as a first step to gain insights into their potential roles in various aspects of poplar growth and development, enabling a better understanding of the cle gene family in a tree species.

a complete list of ptcles identified in the present study. the names in bold indicate the ptcle proteins which were also identified in oelkers et al.  <cit> 



similar to arabidopsis cle proteins, ptcles displayed few sequence features with each other, apart from the secretion signals and the cle motifs . in line with the atcle members, the presence and location of putative n-terminal signal peptide cleavage sites were predicted in each ptcle . it has been shown that deletion of the putative cle signal peptide inactivated the cle protein activity in vivo, suggesting that the signal peptide is essential for in vivo functions of cle peptides  <cit> .fig.  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of representative ptcle proteins and the consensus sequence for the cle motifs of poplar and arabidopsis. a the multiple sequence alignment of representative ptcle proteins. the predicted proteolytic cleavage sites are indicated by the small arrowheads. the cle motif is boxed. b-c weblogo plots were used for display the cle motifs of poplar and arabidopsis




the cle proteins contain one or more c-terminal conserved cle motif, which was reported to be a 12â€“ <dig> amino acid hydroxyprolinated, triarabinosylated peptide, and was the functional domain of cle proteins  <cit> . meme  was employed to investigate the presence and distribution of cle motifs in all ptcle proteins. only one single cle motif was found to be present across all ptcles . the presence of multiple cle domains was not observed in any of the ptcle proteins although cle proteins containing multiple cle domains have been reported previously .

the cle motif, a segment that contains the mature cle peptide sequence, is highly conserved across all cle proteins  <cit> . as expected, the consensus sequences of the cle motif between atcle and ptcle are highly conserved , suggesting functional conservation between ptcles and atcles. similar to atcles, residues r <dig>  p <dig>  g <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and h <dig> of the cle motifs in ptcles are highly conserved . only moderate conservation was observed for amino acids  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  although a similar probability of occurrence presented in both atcles and ptcles . these conserved residues might provide a framework for the physical binding with their presumed receptors. studies have been reported that residues d, h, g, p <dig>  r and p <dig> of the cle domain were critical for proper atclv <dig> function in sam as evidenced by ala-substitutions  <cit> . in addition, residues in the flanking sequences and the hydroxylation/arabinosylation modifications of residue p <dig> are also critical to the atclv <dig> function . furthermore, a gly-to-thr substitution in the cle motifs resulted in a strong dominant-negative effect  <cit> . however, to what extent the conservation of these residues in the cle motif across poplar and arabidopsis could reflect their functional relevance awaits further investigation. furthermore, the cle motif exhibited residue divergence at positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , which may provide the basis for distinct functions of the individual ptcles and/or the specificity of the putative receptor binding.

four or five residues proximal to the cle motif at the n-terminus are required for proper endoproteolytic processing and optimal function in stem cell regulation  <cit> . a comparison of the six residues  proximally adjacent to the cle motifs revealed high divergence across all ptcles, but a degree of residue conservation was found for multiple ptcles . a lys residue is presented before the conserved arg residue of the 12-aa cle motif in many ptcles . this may suggest that the importance of this residue for endopeptidase recognition, which has been shown in the case of atclv <dig> and atcle <dig>  <cit> . additionally,  <dig> out of  <dig> ptcles carried an arg residue immediately following the cle motif at the c-terminus, indicating a possible decrease of peptide activity as has been reported previously  <cit> .

the ptcle proteins are classified into four major distinct groups
although ptcle proteins shared little sequence similarity, the cle motifs were well conserved. therefore, all the cle motif sequences, as well as the full length proteins, were used as the basis to build phylogenetic trees separately. phylogenetic analyses using several methods supported the classification of ptcle proteins into four major groups . the cle motifs of the four groups were aligned, which resulted in consensus sequences supporting for classification of these four groups .fig.  <dig> the ptcle proteins are classified into four major groups. a phylogenetic analysis of ptcle proteins. the tree was generated from the alignment of the cle motifs of all ptcle protein sequences with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the distinct groups are shown by colored branches. b weblogo representation for the cle motifs for each of the four groups



the consensus sequences of the cle motifs in all groups  were highly conserved with five residues that were almost invariant, except for position  <dig> of group ii and position  <dig> of group iv . however, residue divergence across the first six n-terminal residues of the cle motif was observed in all groups, especially in group iv, in which high variance was observed . the cle motifs of groups i, ii and iii lacked the conservation of the ser residue at position  <dig>  which was invariant in group iv . the lys residue at position  <dig> of group i was highly conserved, whereas the residue at the same position of other groups was rather variable . group ii contained a group-specific ser residue at position  <dig>  which may be largely responsible for its separation into a distinct group . however, whether the conserved residues and/or distinct group-specific residues contribute to cle functionalities requires biological validation.

previously, cle proteins identified from various plant species were categorized into thirteen groups  <cit> . a closer examination of the cle consensus sequences revealed that groups i, ii, iii and iv of ptcles corresponded to groups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented in  <cit> , respectively. the comparison indicated a similar signature of the cle motifs in both classifications. it was reported that arabidopsis cle was classified into four functional groups based on the effects of peptide treatment on plants  <cit> , which was well correlated with the phylogenetic analysis of atcles  <cit> . the classification presented in  <cit>  contained at least one functional cle in each group, which helped to understand the possible function of individual ptcle group. nevertheless, the correlation of phylogenetic analyses between ours and  <cit>  implied strong functional similarities between interspecies orthologs as validated by many functional characterized cle genes from arabidopsis, rice, medicago, lotus japonicus and soybean  <cit> . for instance, group iv members, which correspond to the group  <dig> as classified in  <cit> , were predicted to confer similar phenotypic effects on vascular development in poplar to those observed in arabidopsis  <cit> . however, determining whether these predicted gene functions are evolutionarily conserved requires further biological investigation.

genomic organization of ptcle genes
similar to atcle genes, ptcle genes often lacked introns. only thirteen ptcle genes contained intron, seven of which contained one intron and six of which contained two introns . ptcle genes scattered over on different chromosomes although some clustering can be observed . furthermore, some of the ptcle genes were found to be located adjacently to each other . for instance, ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> were located in tandem on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. additionally, ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> were organized sequentially in tandem on chromosome  <dig> . however, sequence comparison within those tandem pairs showed low sequence similarity, and the cle motifs were not totally identical, implying that these genes might not arise from recent tandem duplication events . these observations may indicate, in some cases, that diversity in the cle motifs was favored during evolution which may give rise to distinct roles of ptcles and expansion of the ptcle gene family.fig.  <dig> genomic organization of ptcle genes. a the ptcle gene structure is presented using gray boxes for exons, lines for the introns, and bold lines for utrs, respectively. the black boxes mark the cle motifs. b physical locations of ptcle genes on populus chromosomes. the ptcle genes are located according to the jgi populus v <dig>  gene annotation. the scale bar represents  <dig> Â mb



interestingly, a number of ptcle genes located on different chromosomes encoded identical, or nearly identical cle motifs, suggesting that these ptcle genes were possibly duplicated genes arising from segmental duplication events . for instance, the cle motifs of the positionally adjacent pairs ptcle7/ptcle <dig> were almost identical to that of ptcle36/ptcle <dig>  while those of ptcle40/ptcle <dig> were nearly identical to that of ptcle45/ptcle <dig> . moreover, ptcle <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> comprised identical cle motifs, while ptcle <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared the same cle motifs . a set of five pairs, ptcle7/ptcle <dig>  ptcle18/ptcle <dig>  ptcle20/ptcle <dig>  ptcle22/ptcle <dig> and ptcle28/ptcle <dig>  carried identical cle motifs within pairs . these results suggested that genome-scale duplication of ptcle genes occurred in different regions of poplar chromosomes. in tomato, neighboring slcle genes, sharing no significant similarity within pairs, were found on different chromosomes, suggesting that these neighboring slcle were not likely to arise through tandem duplication  <cit> . however, it was observed that many atcle gene pairs, e.g., atcle9/atcle <dig> and atcle5/atcle <dig>  may have arisen through duplication. additionally, many atcle genes were found in regions of the genome that were rich in repetitive sequences  <cit> . these results suggested that rearrangement and gene duplication were plausible mechanisms for the expansion of the atcle gene family  <cit> . therefore, like atcles, genome duplication and reshuffling contributed to the expansion of ptcle gene family  <cit> . moreover, unlike arabidopsis, the subsequent diversity in the cle motifs of ptcles also has driven the expansion of this family.

probing the roles of ptcle genes by phylogenetic analyses and expression profiles between arabidopsis and poplar
as the first attempt to investigate potential role of ptcles, the phylogenetic relationships between atcles and ptcles were analyzed . the phylogenetic analysis classified the ptcles and atcles into several clades with varying degrees of phylogenetic distance based on the conserved cle motifs that were used to construct the phylogenetic tree . although the phylogenetic tree is based on the cle motif alone, the clades defined by this tree correlated very well with phylogenetic relationship defined using full-length cle proteins .fig.  <dig> comparative studies of representative atcles and ptcles with identical or nearly identical cle motifs. each subclade which contains a well-known atcles  and their closest poplar counterparts derived from the phylogenetic analysis of all atcles and ptcles as depicted in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  the identical residues are shaded in black while similar residues are shaded in grey. a the atclv <dig> clade; b the atcle <dig> clade; c the atcle <dig> clade; d the atcle41/tdif clade



overall, our analysis indicated that the ptcle proteins were quite closely related to their predicted arabidopsis counterparts, which allowed interspecies identification of putative functional orthologs . some clades segregated atcle and ptcle proteins, whereas other clades contained cle proteins of both species . each of these clades contained at least one functionally characterized member, allowing us to infer possible functions for the ptcles in the same clade . thus, the potential function of ptcles in each clade was predicted using functionally characterized atcles . as aforementioned, many ptcle proteins contained perfectly matched cle motifs . particularly, some ptcle proteins comprised cle motifs that matched completely with the cle motifs of atcle proteins . it is presumed that ptcles with identical cle motifs or ptcles carrying the same cle motifs as that of atcles might share similar protein functions  <cit> . in addition to the cle motif, the expression domain of cle genes is also important for their functional specificities as have been shown that many atcle proteins acted interchangeably when ectopically expressed  <cit> . therefore, we assessed potential roles of ptcle genes using a combination of phylogenetic analyses and available transcriptomic data.

the roles of atclv <dig>  atcle1/atcle3/atcle <dig>  atcle9/atcle <dig> and atcle41/tdif have been functionally characterized previously  <cit> . we thus further identified ptcles sharing identical or nearly identical cle motifs with those well-studied atcles. three ptcles  were grouped together with atclv <dig>  of which ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> shared a nearly identical cle motif with atclv <dig> . atclv <dig>  perceived by various parallel receptor complexes, restricted expression of the stem cell-promoting transcription factor wus, which in turn activated atclv <dig> expression, thus forming a negative feedback loop that maintained a balanced stem cell population . indeed, ptcle <dig> showed a highest expression level in shoot apex and a moderate expression level in shoot and leaf primordia of all materials tested, strongly supporting a possible role for ptcle <dig>  similar to atclv <dig>  in regulating poplar shoot development . however, we cannot exclude the possibility that ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> also play roles in shoots.fig.  <dig> transcriptional profiling of ptcle genes in representative shoot and vascular tissues. the microarray data were downloaded from geo and normalized for analysis. color scale represents log <dig> expression values



atcle <dig>  atcle <dig> and atcle <dig> repressed the lateral root development in a clv1-dependent manner in arabidopsis  <cit> . two ptcles, ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig>  shared an identical cle motif as that of atcle1/atcle3/atcle <dig> . ptcle <dig> was found to predominantly expressed in the xylem , unlike what has been observed for atcle <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a different role of ptcle <dig>  however, it still will be of great interest, as the first step, to investigate whether the expression of ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> are induced under nitrogen deficient conditions.

atcle9/atcle <dig> inhibited protoxylem vessel formation via clv <dig> by repressing the expression of arr <dig> and arr <dig> in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . a pair of ptcles  comprised the same cle motif as that of atcle9/atcle <dig> . similar to atcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> was highly expressed in vascular tissues . numerous clv2-like proteins have been mined from poplar  <cit> , which favors the idea that a similar atcle9/atcle10-clv <dig> signaling pathway regulates root vascular development in poplar as well.

a subclade of four ptcles  grouped together with atcle41/tdif, sharing an identical cle motif , which strongly supported a conserved role of these peptides in the regulation of vascular cambium homeostasis in poplar and arabidopsis. intriguingly, in all materials tested, ptcle <dig> had the highest expression level in phloem, and was almost absent from xylem . this expression pattern was similar to that of its putative arabidopsis counterpart atcle41/tdif  <cit> . ptcle <dig>  another ptcle gene encoding an identical cle motif with that of atcle41/tdif, was highly expressed in cambium and moderately expressed in phloem, which may suggest a broader role for ptcle <dig> in poplar . in arabidopsis, the plasma membrane-bound receptor pxy/tdr perceived the atcle41/tdif to promote the cambial proliferation by regulating wox <dig> expression, and to suppress cambial cell differentiation into xylem cells  <cit> . recently, etchells et al.  <cit>  showed that tissue-specific expression of pttpxy and pttcle <dig> produced transgenic trees with increased wood production and a larger biomass. notably, pttcle <dig> was the same cle protein as ptcle <dig> identified in this study . altogether, it seems possible that ptcle <dig> also plays a similar role in the regulation of cambium development and wood formation. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that ptcle <dig> carrying the same cle motif as atcle41/tdif, is also involved in cambium stem cell homoeostasis . taken all together, this pointed to the existence of a similar atcle41/tdif-tdr/pxy module in regulating secondary growth in trees. however, whether the other three ptcle proteins , which contained an identical cle motif as that of pttcle41/ptcle <dig>  sharing a similar function remained unknown. four hundred receptor-like kinases  and eighteen wus-related proteins have been identified in poplar, which supports the idea that the existence of multiple cle-rlk-wox signaling pathways  <cit> .

in summary, we grouped and compared the ptcle proteins with their most closely-related atcle proteins to assess their potential roles based on functional studies . the study indicated that ptcle proteins are generally closely related to their predicted arabidopsis counterparts. intriguingly, many ptcle proteins comprised exactly the same cle motifs as that of their arabidopsis counterparts, strongly suggesting functional conservation between specific atcles and ptcles. however, it is also possible that those ptcles carrying identical cle motifs play distinct roles in planta which could be achieved via tissue-specific expression pattern. additionally, a few sets of ptcles shared an identical or nearly identical cle motif, whereas no closely-related atcles could be identified in the phylogenetic clades , raising the possibility that these ptcles may have unique functions in woody trees. it is of great interest to examine whether those ptcles possessing similar cle motifs are functionally redundant as what has been observed in the atcle gene family  <cit> . nevertheless, it is important to assess to what extent these observations are supported by biological validation.

uncovering putative functions of ptcle genes in shoot and vascular development
previous studies have demonstrated that cle peptides played various roles in plant growth and development . to deepen our understanding of the potential functions of ptcle proteins, in silico expression data for  <dig> out of  <dig> ptcle genes were obtained from different populus species other than p. trichocarpa for further analysis . a total of six developmental microarray sets including samples derived from various organs and tissues were retrieved and normalized for further study with an emphasis on shoot organogenesis and vascular development .

ptcle genes generally exhibited differential expression patterns in the materials tested , similar to what was observed for the expression of atcles  <cit> . other than ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig>  and ptcle <dig> are also highly expressed in shoot apex and/or shoot and leaf primordia . among these, ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> showed consistent expression patterns in two tested samples. ptcle <dig> is limited to the shoot apex, whereas ptcle <dig> expression is relatively restricted to the shoot and leaf primordia, indicating a spatially and temporally expression fashion . however, whether any of these ptcle proteins are involved in controlling the stem cell homoeostasis in shoot apex or in primordia remained to be proven.

the cambium, a stem-cell tissue, gives rise to the phloem and xylem which perform essential roles in transportation of water, mineral nutrients and signaling molecules  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the atcle41/tdip-tdr/pxy-wox <dig> signaling module plays an important role in cambium proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . additionally, a number of atcles are shown to control vascular development, which assigned cles as central players mediating cell-cell communication in plant vascular development  <cit> . in our analysis, we found that a number of ptcle genes are predominantly expressed in various vascular tissues, except the aforementioned ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> . ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> are expressed at the highest level in cambium and xylem, while ptcle10/ptcle13/ptcle21/ptcle27/ptcle35/ptcle <dig> exhibited a peak expression level in xylem. ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> are predominantly expressed in the cambium . the expression of ptcle <dig>  ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig> is mainly detected in the phloem . the transcriptional activities of the remaining ptcle genes are highly dynamic .

interestingly, we found that ptcle gene pairs encoding identical cle motifs, including ptcle3/ptcle <dig>  ptcle21/ptcle <dig>  and ptcle28/ptcle <dig>  exhibited both overlapping and distinct expression patterns with respect to different tissues . this points to functional divergence of these ptcle genes in planta despite that they share the same cle motif. we further investigated whether expression trends are similar between atcle genes and their putative poplar orthologues. in addition to previously high-resolution expression data for the entire arabidopsis a-type cle genes  <cit> , we compiled and visualized the expression profile of atcle genes in selected tissues by e-northerns browser of bar . in silico expression data for  <dig> out of  <dig> atcle genes were available. in the case of atcle <dig>  it was highly expressed in meristematic tissues and xylem-rich samples . a similar expression trend was observed for its putative poplar orthologues ptcle <dig> and ptcle <dig>  both of which exhibited significant expression levels in cambium and developing-/differentiating-xylem . however, only some cle genes of arabidopsis and poplar are presented in the microarrays, making it difficult for in-depth investigation. nevertheless, it is also likely that other ptcle genes which are not available on the microarrays show significant expression in some tissues. thus we analyzed the available est sequences and rna-seq data to explore the expression of the ptcle genes that are not presented in the microarray. the corresponding ests and rna-seq reads were extracted from public databases, demonstrating that these ptcle genes were transcribed based on the numbers of ests detected and the fpkm  values for rna-seq data . in several cases, there are no matched est were identified in p. trichocarpa, but matched est from sibling species or high fpkm value could be detected . the matched ests varied in numbers, suggesting that they are expressed differentially or the ones with few ests are probably expressed at low level or restrict to particular tissues or developmental stages. altogether, our data indicated a complicated expression profile amongst the ptcle genes, which is well correlated with their diverse roles in poplar growth and development.

CONCLUSIONS
the cle genes are well known for their roles in coordinating stem cell fate in different types of plant meristems including the vascular cambium, which is the most notable growth characteristic in tree species. in this study, the cle gene family in p. trichocarpa, a tree species with extensive wood formation, was identified and classified into four major groups based on sequence similarity. the potential roles of ptcle genes, with an emphasis on shoot organogenesis, secondary growth and wood formation, were analyzed by comparative studies and transcriptional profiling. a number of ptcle proteins and their putative arabidopsis orthologues were identified based on identical or nearly identical cle motifs and comparable tissue expression expression patterns, pointing to possible functional conservation of these cle proteins. conversely, some ptcle genes appeared to be regulated in completely different ways from their arabidopsis counterparts, which may provide insights into the functional divergence of cle signaling in tress species. the comparative studies further indicated close parallel regulation of atcles and ptcles orthologues, which highlighted potential strategies such as manipulation of key plant peptide signaling molecules for higher yields and more sustainable wood sources.
