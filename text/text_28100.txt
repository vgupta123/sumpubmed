BACKGROUND
sugarcane mosaic virus is one of the most prevalent viral pathogens, causing significant global losses in maize grain and forage yields  <cit> , especially in china and germany  <cit> . a recent report of scmv in poland and central france revealed that the incidence of scmv continues to increase  <cit> . the diagnostic symptoms of infection with scmv include stunting, chlorosis, and reduction in plant weight and grain yield  <cit> . scmv, formerly denoted as maize dwarf mosaic virus  strain b, and belongs to the family potyviridae <cit> . other members of the family potyviridae that also infect maize include mdmv, wheat streak mosaic virus , johnson grass mosaic virus , sorghum mosaic virus , and zea mosaic virus   <cit> . control of scmv by agronomic and chemical means is ineffective owing to the non-persistent transmission mode of the virus by aphid vectors. thus, deployment of resistant varieties is the most important way to prevent yield losses, which is based on screening and identification of resistant germplasm  <cit> .

u.s. inbred line pa <dig> shows complete resistance to mdmv and scmv under both field and greenhouse conditions after artificial inoculation  <cit> . in europe, a collection of  <dig> early maturing maize inbred lines was screened for resistance against scmv, resulting in the identification of three lines, d <dig>  d <dig>  and fap1360a, that displayed complete resistance to scmv  <cit> . in china, many elite inbred lines display complete resistance when challenged with scmv inoculum  <cit> . analysis of quantitative trait loci  in a cross between the resistant line d <dig> and susceptible line d <dig> revealed two major dominant genes on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and three minor qtl on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . high-resolution mapping using progeny from the cross between fap1360a  and f <dig>  confirmed that scmv <dig>  and scmv <dig>  are crucial for maize resistance to scmv  <cit> . similar mapping results have been reported in several independent experiments  <cit> . the scmv <dig> locus has also been detected in a resistant chinese line, huangzao <dig>  together with additional qtl on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> . in the progeny of siyi×mo <dig>  two major genes were mapped on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . by using an f9-derived immortalized ril population obtained from the cross of huangzao4×mo <dig>  a major qtl was detected between chromosome bins  <dig>  and  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variation and decreasing the disease index by  <dig> %  <cit> . the loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> have also been confirmed in tropical maize germplasm from brazil  <cit> . with the aid of the whole-genome b <dig> sequence, the scmv <dig> region was fine-mapped to a region of  <dig>  cm, covering a physical distance of  <dig> . <dig> kb. four predicted genes possibly involved in virus movement are likely candidates for scmv <dig> <cit> . existence of two closely linked resistance genes within the scmv <dig> region has been postulated  <cit> . interestingly, several qtl that confer resistance to various viruses all map to the same region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . it is currently uncertain, whether a single pleitropic scmv <dig> gene confers resistance to different viruses, or distinct resistance genes are clustered in this region.

even though diverse mapping populations have been used, all studies consistently identified the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> genomic regions as being critical to confer resistance to scmv. in this study, we first conducted the fine-mapping of scmv <dig> using a large isogenic mapping population previously shown to segregate solely for scmv <dig> <cit> . second, we employed two ril populations from elite parental lines with contrasting resistance to scmv to confirm and further fine map the scmv <dig> locus. third, we identified a limited number of positional scmv <dig> candidate genes based on the combined fine-mapping results. finally, we conducted candidate gene-based association mapping to characterize the qtl region and candidate genes using a panel of  <dig> maize inbred lines with variable resistance to scmv.

RESULTS
fine-mapping of scmv <dig> in a near-isogenic f <dig> population
of  <dig> unselected f <dig> plants,  <dig> exhibited typical symptoms of scmv infection within 2– <dig> weeks after the first inoculation. the numbers of resistant and susceptible plants segregated in a 3: <dig> ratio , in agreement with inheritance of a single dominant gene. using the  <dig> polymorphic simple sequence repeat  markers available from the maize genetics and genomics database  , the scmv <dig> locus was mapped between umc <dig> and umc <dig>  with a physical distance of  <dig>  mb according to the b <dig> physical map . owing to the lack of high-density markers,  <dig> recombinants between these two markers could not be resolved. accordingly, we developed  <dig> new markers  based on the public maize bacterial artificial chromosome  sequences accessible in genbank at the national center for biotechnology information . we used these  <dig> new markers to resolve the  <dig> recombinants. subsequent marker-phenotype analysis enabled us to progressively refine the scmv <dig> region into a  <dig> -kb interval between sts- <dig> and sts- <dig> , with still two recombinants in between those two markers. thereafter, the markers sts- <dig> and sts- <dig> were used to genotype  <dig> f <dig> susceptible plants, resulting in  <dig> new recombinants. within the sts-5/sts- <dig> interval, single/low copy sequences were exploited to develop seven additional markers . these markers were used to genotype  <dig> recombinants, which allowed us to delimit the scmv <dig> locus into a  <dig> -kb interval flanked by the two closest markers, r1- <dig> and sts- <dig> . there were still six recombinants to the left and eight recombinants to the right side of the scmv <dig> locus . comparison with the b <dig> physical map indicated that the two closest markers, r1- <dig> and the sts- <dig>  reside on the adjacent bacs in genbank: b0129g <dig> and b0598n <dig>  respectively.

validation of scmv <dig> in rils
given that the scmv <dig> region could not be narrowed further using the near-isogenic f <dig> population, we used two ril populations with parental lines contrasting in resistance to scmv to confirm and fine-map the scmv <dig> region. as both of the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci are involved in maize resistance to scmv, each ril was investigated for its genotype at the scmv <dig> locus using the co-segregating marker djf <dig> developed by ingvardsen et al.  <cit> . given that one of the scmv <dig> flanking markers, sts- <dig>  failed to reveal any polymorphism between parents of each of the two ril populations, we searched for an alternative marker around sts- <dig> and finally developed a new marker, b <dig>  which is located approximately  <dig> -kb downstream of sts <dig>  the b <dig> marker, together with the r1- <dig> marker, were then used to jointly genotype all rils at the scmv <dig> locus. for each ril population, four sets of  <dig> rils, which differed at either the scmv <dig> or scmv <dig> or both loci, were separately selected for phenotypic evaluation.

in the ril population of zheng58×chang7- <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> rils that share the same haplotype as chang7- <dig> at both scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci  were highly resistant to scmv. of  <dig> rils with the chang7- <dig> haplotype at scmv <dig>  but the zheng <dig> haplotype at scmv <dig> , only one ril was resistant to scmv. another two sets of  <dig> rils sharing the same haplotype as zheng <dig> at the scmv <dig> locus  were all susceptible to scmv. a similar result was observed in the ril population of x178×huangc, all  <dig> rils sharing the same haplotype as x <dig> at both scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci  displayed high resistance to scmv. of  <dig> rils with the x <dig> haplotype at scmv <dig> and huangc haplotype at scmv <dig> , only four rils were resistant to scmv. another two sets of  <dig> rils which share the same haplotype as huangc at the scmv <dig> locus  were all susceptible to scmv. these findings indicate that the presence of both scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci are prerequisite for scmv resistance as described in previous reports  <cit> . the significant difference  in resistance percentages between rils differing in haplotypes at both scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci suggested the presence of the same resistance loci in both ril populations .

the haplotype at the scmv <dig> locus was detected by its flanked ssr markers r1- <dig> and b4; while the haplotype at the scmv <dig> locus was identified by its co-segregating marker djf <dig>  the genotype ss/ss means both of the scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> loci are the same as zheng <dig> or huangc; rr/rr means both loci are the same as chang7- <dig> or x178; rr/ss means scmv <dig> and scmv1are the same as chang7-2/x <dig> and zheng58/huangc, respectively; while ss/rr means scmv <dig> and scmv <dig> are the same as zheng58/huangc and chang7-2/x <dig>  respectively.

p-value and χ <dig> were calculated by sas  <dig>  using two-way anova.

further fine-mapping of scmv <dig> in rils
given the validation result, the flanking markers b <dig> and r1- <dig> were used to screen for recombinants within the  <dig> -kb scmv <dig> interval. eight and nine recombinants were detected in the ril populations zheng58×chang7- <dig> and x178×huangc, respectively. for the scmv <dig> locus, a co-segregating marker dfj <dig> was used to determine the genotype for each ril. all recombinants were repeatedly investigated for their resistance to scmv under both greenhouse and field conditions. on the other hand, through multiple comparisons of three resistant inbred lines, namely  <dig>  fap1360a, and huangzao <dig>  and one susceptible b <dig> sequences within the b4/r1- <dig> interval, ten markers were developed to resolve the  <dig> recombinants.

of the eight recombinants screened from the ril population of zheng58×chang7- <dig>  four rils were as resistant to scmv as the resistant parent chang7- <dig>  whereas another four rils were as susceptible to scmv as the susceptible parent zheng <dig>  the scmv <dig> locus in three of the susceptible recombinants, nos. <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  was identical to that in the susceptible parent zheng <dig>  and thus they could not be used to define the scmv <dig> locus. the four resistant rils, nos.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  together with one susceptible ril no.  <dig> had the resistance allele as chang7- <dig> at the scmv <dig> locus and thus could be used to fine-map the scmv <dig> locus. the four resistant rils had the chang7- <dig> donor region upstream of the marker b <dig>  and one susceptible ril no.  <dig> had the chang7- <dig> donor region downstream of the marker snp <dig>  these data support that the scmv <dig> locus is located upstream of the marker b <dig> . the mapped scmv <dig> region in the zheng58×chang7- <dig> ril population spanned the  <dig> -kb scmv <dig> region revealed by the near-isogenic f <dig> population and was thus of no value to further narrow down the scmv <dig> locus.

among the nine recombinants screened from the ril population x178×huangc, two displayed the same high resistance to scmv as seen in the resistant parent x <dig>  whereas another seven were as susceptible to scmv as the parent huangc. three highly susceptible rils, nos.  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  carry the huangc susceptibility allele at the scmv <dig> locus. they were thus excluded from fine-mapping of the scmv <dig> locus. four rils, nos.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  had the x <dig> resistance allele at the scmv <dig> locus. however, they were all susceptible to scmv. this finding indicates the absence of the x <dig> resistance allele at the scmv <dig> locus for these four rils. among them, nos.  <dig> and  <dig> rils had the donor huangc region downstream of the marker r1- <dig>  and nos.  <dig> and  <dig> rils had the donor huangc region upstream of the marker snp <dig>  suggesting the scmv <dig> locus is confined by the markers r1- <dig> and snp <dig>  two highly resistant rils, nos.  <dig> and  <dig>  carried the x <dig> resistance allele at the scmv <dig> locus and their scmv <dig> regions were flanked by the markers 579p <dig> and b <dig>  thus, the scmv <dig> locus can be narrowed down into a  <dig> -kb region flanked by the markers 579p <dig> and snp <dig> , located within the  <dig> -kb interval defined by the near-isogenic f <dig> population.

predicting putative genes within and around the mapped scmv <dig> region
a  <dig> -kb sequence flanked by the markers b <dig> and r1- <dig> was retrieved from http://www.maizesequence.org to identify candidate scmv <dig> genes. there are still seven gaps left in this region, indicating some missing sequences. transposable elements account for  <dig> % of this region, of which  <dig> % are retrotransposons, and  <dig> % of the retrotransposons are long terminal repeat elements . we used fgenesh software  to predict ten putative genes from the masked sequence, including seven genes with putative functions, two hypothetical genes, and one gene without significant similarity to known genes . no typical resistance  gene was found in the scmv <dig> region. analysis of possible functions for the seven predicted genes with gene ontology  and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  annotation indicated three of the genes were likely to confer resistance to scmv .

*stands for candidates. first hit, e-value, and query coverage were blastp results of predicted genes from ncbi. kegg entry is the search word for pathway information about the predicted genes based on go blast search results. na means not available.

two of the predicted genes are cycloartenol synthase1-like  genes with high sequence similarity to genes from arabidopsis thaliana. the first had the coverage of 76% and e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  whereas the second had the coverage of 60% and e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  these two cas1-like genes have  <dig> % similarity , with an e value of  <dig> e- <dig>  although they differ in the lengths of their amino-acid sequences. we designated the larger gene  as cas1-like- <dig>  and the smaller one  as cas1-like- <dig>  the other candidate gene, zmtrx-h, encodes a putative 119-residue protein that is highly similar to thioredoxin , an oxidoreductase that acts on sulfur groups of donors, using disulfide as an acceptor.

integration of the mapping results indicated that scmv <dig> localizes to a  <dig> -kb region flanked by 579p <dig> and snp <dig> . of the five predicted genes located in this region, cas1-like- <dig> and zmtrx-h are more likely than the other three genes to confer resistance to scmv.

candidate gene–based association mapping of the scmv <dig> locus
to verify the candidate region and possibly refine the analysis by identifying quantitative trait nucleotide polymorphisms, we conducted an association mapping study using a panel of  <dig> inbred lines , which were divided into six subgroups based on  <dig> ssr markers . multiple sequence alignment analysis identified  <dig> polymorphisms in six informative amplicons. linkage disequilibrium  analysis revealed lower r <dig> between these polymorphisms , with  <dig> % of the r <dig> <  <dig> . two  snp sites, s <dig> and s <dig>  separately located on the 3′-end and intron of zmtrx-h were significantly associated with scmv resistance . nonetheless, a low r <dig> value of  <dig>  indicated two independent functional variants.

discussion
precise phenotypic evaluation is crucial for marker-trait association analysis  <cit> , especially for those traits with incomplete penetrance and phenotypic plasticity. apart from being influenced by two major genes, resistance of maize to scmv is also affected by genetic background and various environmental factors  <cit> . to obtain reliable phenotypic data, we developed a f <dig> mapping population from a near-isogenic pair where the resistance allele was fixed at the scmv <dig> locus, and only scmv <dig> was segregating  <cit> . furthermore, selection of only susceptible individuals from the f <dig> population for fine-mapping of the scmv <dig> locus reduced the possibility of misclassification, as heterozygotes tend to be more plastic in their response to scmv inoculation.

advances in multiple genomic platforms and analytical methods allow fine-mapping and cloning of qtl responsible for important agronomic traits  <cit> . in the current study, development of polymorphic markers in the  <dig> -kb scmv <dig> region was a challenge due to highly repetitive sequences. we thus sequenced the positive bac clones from the  <dig>  fap1360a, and huangzao <dig> bac libraries to mask the repetitive sequences at the scmv <dig> locus, in order to reveal single/low-copy sequences for marker development. generally, re-sequencing of more maize inbred lines  <cit>  and the availability of additional publicly accessible sequence information  will facilitate the development of markers in targeted genome regions. during the process of fine-mapping, we found that the published order of bac contigs  for the scmv <dig> region is incorrect. the bac-based b <dig> whole-genome physical map suggests that the adjacent bac contigs # <dig> and # <dig> should be physically close to one another. however, the genetic distance is so large that none of the recombinants within the umc1018/umc <dig> interval could be further resolved by the newly developed markers based on the contig # <dig>  only the markers developed from the contig # <dig> could resolve the recombinants. this indicates that contig # <dig> is located between contigs # <dig> and # <dig>  and that the correct contig order must be #260-#263-#261-#262-# <dig> . this correct contig order has been released .

searching for recombinants with an unambiguous phenotype is crucial for fine-mapping. thus, we used only highly susceptible individuals in the f <dig> mapping population for fine-mapping, which allowed us to fine-map the scmv <dig> locus into a  <dig> -kb region flanked by r1- <dig> and sts- <dig>  from the fact that the scmv <dig> locus has been repeatedly detected  <cit> , we inferred that scmv <dig> is likely present in various resistant inbred lines. based on this hypothesis, two ril populations were used to fine-map the scmv <dig> locus into a  <dig> -kb region flanked by the markers 579p <dig> and snp <dig> 

the public b <dig> sequence suggested that two predicted genes, the cas1-like homolog and zmtrx-h gene, are the most likely candidates for scmv <dig> owing to their potential roles in disease defense response  <cit> , although the potential influence of hypothetical proteins in the scmv <dig> region on scmv resistance cannot be excluded. comparison with the complete cas <dig> gene from arabidopsis thaliana, which encodes  <dig> residues, suggests that the putative cas1-like gene may be partial gene containing the terpene_synthases motif. cas <dig> is involved in biosynthesis of steroids and non-steroidal secondary metabolites, such as campesterol and stigmasterol  <cit> . campesterol is the precursor of brassinosteroids, an important class of plant hormones that functions in cellular signal transduction, whereas the accumulation of stigmasterol stimulates an important plant metabolic process that occurs following bacterial infection of leaves  <cit> . given that phenotypic variance associated with changes in the scmv <dig> region are influenced by the stage of plant development  <cit> , it remains to be established whether the situation with scmv <dig> closely resembles that of hm <dig>  a truncated duplicate of hm <dig>  compared to hm <dig>  hm <dig> preferentially functions in adult plants, conferring resistance against the leaf spot and ear mold disease caused by cochliobolus carbonumrace  <dig> <cit> .

thioredoxin is a master regulator of cellular redox status  <cit> , with h-type thioredoxin reported to function in defense responses to viruses  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . given that the zmtrx-h protein in the scmv <dig> region lacks the conserved wcpc motif, which is essential for redox protein activities, it seems unlikely that zmtrx-h affects cellular redox status. hence, additional investigation of the roles of the three candidate genes is required to uncover the mechanism of scmv resistance.

linkage and association analysis are two prevalent approaches to map genes or qtl. both can be used in a complementary manner to dissect the genetic basis of traits of interest  <cit> , as well as to fine-map causative variants of targeted qtl  <cit> . six pairs of primers were used to test the association of specific stretches of sequence in the scmv <dig> region with scmv resistance. general linear model  analysis highlighted three polymorphisms associated with scmv resistance. the significant association between the pav and scmv resistance validates the role of the scmv <dig> region with disease resistance, whereas the association between two other snps and scmv resistance provides statistical support for zmtrx-h as the primary candidate for scmv <dig>  moreover, these two snp located in the intron and 3′-end of zmtrx-h, respectively, seemingly having an influence on the gene’s expression. the cas1-like- <dig> gene cannot yet be excluded, as there was no primer pair available in the vicinity of it. therefore, a complementary functional test via transformation is still needed to identify which candidate gene, if any, defines scmv <dig>  these transgenic experiments are underway in our lab.

broad-spectrum resistance , resistance against two or more types of pathogen species or the majority of races of the same pathogen species  <cit> , is essential to improve the resistance of crops to various diseases. the quantitative resistance gene lr <dig> cloned recently confers resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust, powdery mildew and various other diseases of wheat  <cit> . the evidence for the presence of multiple disease resistance genes in a maize association population  <cit>  revealed that quantitative bsr can be conferred by a single gene. the scmv <dig> region has been reported to associate with resistance to other members of the potyviridae family, including wsmv and mdmv  <cit> . the near isogenic line f7rr/rr, which was used as a resistant parental line in this study, was also found to be resistant to mdmv and zemv  <cit> . according to a model proposed by kou  <cit> , a single gene conferring bsr may function in either basal-resistance pathways, in overlapping pathways that confer race-specific resistances, or at sites of cross-talk between different defense pathways. given that both candidate genes have putative roles in basal resistance, scmv <dig> likely confers bsr, which would be advantageous in environments where plants are threatened by multiple pathogens. however, this speculation remains to be verified by artificial inoculation of transgenic plants and recombinants with the appropriate range of pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
we have fine-mapped scmv <dig> to a  <dig> -kb region through integrating mapping data from different populations. this provides indispensable data for initiating molecular breeding to improve scmv resistance in maize, a crop that is critical to world food security. we identified two candidates, of which the zmtrx-h gene seems the most promising. map-based cloning of scmv <dig> and transgenic analyses will shed light on the molecular mechanism of this important plant-virus interaction.
