BACKGROUND
the us centers for disease control  has declared opioid prescribing to be at epidemic levels  <cit> ; use of these drugs primarily for the treatment of chronic pain has increased exponentially over the past 15 years in the us and many other western nations  <cit> . unfortunately, opioid therapy is often accompanied by opioid dose escalation, loss of treatment effect, progression of pain complaints and disability. for example, more than 1/3rd of chronic pain patients double their oral opioid doses in the first few years of treatment  <cit> , and those treated with intrathecal opioids experience 12–17 % increases in opioid doses each year on average  <cit> . moreover, clinical studies have shown greater pain sensitivity in chronic pain patients treated with opioids with changes proportional to the duration of therapy and the doses used  <cit> . equally concerning, opioid dose escalation either in the setting of acute injury or when used to provide analgesia for chronic pain patients is associated with increased risks of side effects, abuse, overdose and death  <cit> . these problems involving loss of treatment effect and consequent dose escalation are believed to be caused in large part by maladaptations such as tolerance and the related phenomenon of opioid-induced hyperalgesia   <cit> . we have no clinically available strategies effective in preventing or reversing these changes.

genetic approaches to understanding opioid maladaptations offer the advantage of taking a hypothesis-free approach to the identification of underlying mechanisms. laboratory studies using inbred mice demonstrate that analgesic tolerance, physical dependence and opioid-induced hyperalgesia all display a very large degree of heritability  . likewise, numerous studies conducted in mice have identified quantitative trait loci  and individual genes linked to specific maladaptations such as tolerance  <cit> , dependence  <cit>  and oih  <cit> . in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor linked to oih and the 5-ht <dig> receptor linked to physical dependence, the murine genetic findings were confirmed in small translational trials in humans  <cit> .

haplotype-based computational genetic mapping  has recently advanced to the point that whole-genome sequence data can be used to identify genetic factors affecting drug responses  <cit> . using this approach, we recently found that the dcc gene affects oih and tolerance  <cit> . however, highly polymorphic genes have a relatively high probability for matching unrelated phenotypes by hbcgm due to the large number of haplotype blocks that can be formed within the gene. this effect can be particularly problematic when multiple different phenotypes are evaluated. hence, a more accurate ranking of genes can be obtained if we correct for the false discovery rate  of each gene  <cit> . in this set of studies, we use a newly derived method for fdr correction in combination with data from multiple opioid maladaptation phenotypes to reproduce the earlier dcc association and to identify a novel gene regulating clinically important maladaptations to opioids.

RESULTS
haplotype-based computational genetic mapping of opioid maladaptations
six opiate responses were analyzed in  <dig> inbred strains, which include: mechanical hindpaw oih, thermal hindpaw oih, thermal tail flick oih, morphine analgesic tolerance, physical dependence and morphine-induced changes in body mass . for this analysis, hbcgm was first applied to each phenotype individually. each analysis produced a list of genes  with patterns of allelic variation that were associated with each phenotype. we then analyzed the results obtained for  <dig> opioid adaptation phenotypes in an integrated fashion . the output of the integrative analysis identifies the genes exhibiting the strongest association to all six phenotypes.fig.  <dig> opioid-induced changes in nociceptive thresholds for  <dig> strains of mice. these data were reproduced from our earlier report  <cit> . in panel  the reduction in mechanical nociceptive thresholds are displayed as a fraction of the baseline thresholds. the strains are displayed from the most to least robustly changed. in panel  thermal withdrawal thresholds measured using a hargreaves’ apparatus are displayed as a fraction of baseline threshold. in panel  changes in thermal withdrawal threshold of the tail  response are provided. for each trait the mean value is displayed +/− s.e.m., n =  <dig> mice per strain

in order to correct for false discovery, we applied fdr correction methodology to the individual phenotype mapping results prior to integrating across the phenotypes. the grouped analysis results after fdr and integration are also given in table  <dig>  of note, without fdr filtering, mpdz was ranked 26th, whereas after fdr filtering mpdz was ranked 1st. the three phenotypes contributing most strongly to the ranking of mpdz in the fdr corrected mapping results were tolerance, mechanical hindpaw oih and weight loss. the dcc gene associated with a more limited set of opioid maladaptive traits for these  <dig> strains and also appears on the final list, though at a lower position than previously found  <cit> . the mpdz gene has been demonstrated to be involved in synaptic functions including long-term potentiation to which spinally-mediated opioid maladaptations such as tolerance and hyperalgesia have been compared  <cit> . the sgcz gene listed in second position in table  <dig> dropped out of the top  <dig> most strongly after application of the fdr correction to 60th position, but was still strongly correlated with the physical dependence/jumping phenotype.table  <dig> rank of genes associated the opioid adaptive phenotypes after fdr correction. while the dcc gene remained highly associated, mpdz rose to the top of the list

mpdz expression in spinal cord tissue
a change in either mpdz expression levels or in the function of the mature mupp <dig> protein could contribute to the observed maladaptive differences among the inbred strains. to determine if differences in mpdz expression differed between strains with divergent opioid phenotypes, we examined spinal cord tissue, which a principal center responsible for opioid tolerance and oih  <cit> . we selected the c57bl/ <dig> and 129s1/svim strains as representative of strongly adaptive and adaptation-resistant strains, respectively. the spinal cord tissue of the c57bl/ <dig> mice had higher levels of mpdz mrna  and protein  than the 129s1/svim animals. moreover, morphine treatment did not alter mrna levels in either strain.fig.  <dig> 
mpdz expression and mupp <dig> levels in mouse spinal cord tissue. in these experiments the effects of both genotype and morphine treatment were evaluated. panel  provides the results of qpcr experiments in which the index c57bl/ <dig> and low-adapting 129s1/svim strains were used. baseline mpdz levels were lower in the 129s1/svim strain, but the levels of mpdz mrna were unchanged by morphine treatment in both of the strains tested. in panel  the results of western analysis are provided demonstrating that 129s1/svim mice have lower spinal levels of mpdz/mupp <dig> protein. for each trait the mean value is displayed +/− s.e.m., n =  <dig> mice per group. *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> 



mpdz knockdown and morphine maladaptations
in order to test the functional role of mpdz in opioid maladaptations in mice, we tested littermate wild-type and mpdz +/− heterozygous mice in the c57bl/ <dig> background. these heterozygous mice have cns mpdz/mupp <dig> levels that are 47 % of those found in wild type mice  <cit> . while the heterozygous mice have normal baseline mechanical nociceptive thresholds, they do not develop oih to the degree displayed by the wild-type mice . in addition, analgesic tolerance to morphine is reduced in these heterozygous animals though drug naïve morphine sensitivity was not found to differ between the strains. on the other hand, mpdz heterozygous mice did not display altered physical dependence, nor was the degree of weight loss different after morphine treatment.fig.  <dig> opioid adaptations in c57bl/ <dig> wild-type and mpdz

mpdz/mupp <dig> interaction with camkii
earlier work described the interaction of camkii with mupp <dig> as a key event governing the activation of nmda receptors in hippocampal neurons  <cit> . this has relevance to morphine treatment as both nmda receptor activation and camkii activity in spinal tissue are critical for opioid tolerance and oih  <cit> . co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to identify synaptosomal proteins that co-precipitated with mupp <dig>  after precipitation of mupp <dig> protein using an anti-mupp <dig> antibody, the amount of associated camkii was quantified by immunoblot analysis. although camkii co-precipitated with mupp <dig>  there was not a difference in the amount of associated camkii after morphine treatment in the high adaptive strains . since the 129s1/svlm strain possesses an amino acid substitution within the camkii binding region of mupp <dig> , we hypothesized we would observe lower camkii co-immunoprecipitation with mupp <dig> in mouse spinal cord synaptosomes made from 129s1/svlm animals. although 129s1/svlm mice may possess less mupp <dig> in their spinal cord tissue, the relative amount of camkii co-precipitating with the mupp <dig> protein was the same in spinal cord tissue obtained from c57bl/ <dig> and 129s1/svlm mice . additional experiments quantifying activated  phospho-camkii in the mupp <dig> immunoprecipitates also failed to identify strain or morphine effects .fig.  <dig> co-immunoprecipitation of mupp <dig> with camkii in mouse spinal cord tissue. spinal cord synaptosomes were first incubated with anti-mupp <dig> . after column purification, the immune complexes were eluted and separated on acrylamide gels. blots were probed with anti-camkii to quantify mupp1-camkii association. panel  provides the results of co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrating that mupp1-camkii association is unchanged by morphine treatment in c57bl/ <dig> mice. in panel  the results suggest mupp <dig> protein from 129s1/svlm and c57bl/ <dig> mice bind camkii similarly. for each measurement the mean value is displayed +/− s.e.m., n =  <dig> mice per group



discussion
despite their undisputed efficacy and wide-spread use for the relief of acute pain, the chronic use of opioids is limited by maladaptations, most importantly tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia . dose escalation caused by these maladaptations has been associated with poor functional outcomes, greater rates of overdose and death  <cit> . little progress has been made in designing strategies to limit or reverse these problems. whole-genome genetic mapping studies offer the possibility of identifying new mechanisms underlying key maladaptations that might be targeted using novel treatment strategies. unfortunately, this form of mapping is prone to high rates of false discovery due to the number of comparisons made in performing whole-genome studies. our approach of using a false discovery rate  correction in combination with an integration of mapping results across opioid adaptive phenotypes helps to make the mapping results more reliable. in these studies the mpdz gene was associated with maladaptive opioid phenotypes, and was confirmed as a gene relevant to these phenotypes using mpdz +/− heterozygous mice. this result suggests that we look more closely at the mpdz/mupp <dig> protein and the pathways in which it participates in understanding and treating opioid tolerance and oih.

a novel aspect of the hbcgm analysis in this study was correcting for the tendency of highly polymorphic genes to show up as being associated with many phenotypes. to address this problem we randomized the mapping from strain names to phenotype measurements many times, and excluded genes that matched too many of the randomized phenotypes. we then ranked genes by a composite score based on their associations with all six related phenotypes. the combination of these methods resulted in the mpdz gene being ranked first, attracting our attention. using previously described whole genome mapping approaches the mpdz gene was ranked much lower in the list of associated genes . on the other hand, a gene previously shown to be highly associated with these phenotypes and confirmed to play a functional role using transgenic animals and biochemical analyses, dcc, remained relatively highly correlated.

it should be realized that additional genetic contributors might be discovered if other measures of oih were used. we selected a thermal and a mechanical measure to provide some phenotypic diversity and to make the measurement of oih practical in large numbers of mouse strains. however, models of inflammatory and incisional pain with different mechanisms and transmission pathways also show heightened nociceptive responses after chronic opioid administration  <cit> . likewise, a non-thermal stimulus could be used to test analgesic tolerance although most alternatives would be more laborious especially for use in large numbers of animals. nevertheless, these might be used in separate mapping studies, or at least the genes discovered using simple models could be tested for relevance in other settings.

the mupp <dig> protein was originally isolated as a partner of the 5-ht2c receptor  <cit> . analysis of the protein revealed  <dig> pdz domains thus leading to an alternative name . a short time later the corresponding murine mpdz gene on chromosome  <dig> was identified and sequenced  <cit> ; the corresponding protein has a predicted molecular weight of 218 kda. pdz domains such as those on mupp <dig> represent key structures for protein-protein interaction  <cit> , and are frequently found near sites of cell-cell interaction such as synapses and tight junctions. indeed several protein partners for mupp <dig> have been identified in tight junctions including claudin proteins  <cit> , a somatostatin receptor   <cit> , and a potassium ion channel   <cit> . likewise mupp <dig> has been localized to synapses in the cns where the protein is widely expressed  <cit> . it is the synaptic expression of this gene that may be responsible for the apparent role of mpdz/mupp <dig> in tolerance and oih. in this regard it is notable that another post-synaptic pdz domain containing scaffolding protein, psd <dig>  is also thought to be involved in opioid maladaptations  <cit> .

mupp <dig> is a key protein both facilitating the organization of neural synapses and in facilitating synaptic plasticity. identified binding partners in mammalian synapses for mupp <dig> in addition to the originally described 5-ht2c receptor interaction include cadm <dig>  <cit> , connexin  <dig>  <cit> , rhoa guanine nucleotide exchange factor   <cit> , camkii, the gabab receptor  <cit> , syngap  <cit>  and the nmda receptor subunit nr2b  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that pdz-containing proteins such as psd- <dig> and mupp <dig> may bring intracellular signaling molecules into proximity with cell surface receptors to enhance signaling efficiency. specifically, mupp <dig> brings the nmda receptor, camkii and syngap into close post-synaptic proximity  <cit> . the activation of nmda receptors then leads to the activation of a mupp1-facilitated cascade ultimately causing the insertion of ampa receptor/channels into the membrane, and persistent facilitation of glutamate signaling. this pathway may contribute to phenomena such as long-term potentiation  or alternative forms of enhanced ampa receptor mediated activity  <cit> .

both opioid analgesic tolerance and oih are reliant upon molecules with which mupp <dig> interacts. for example, the pharmacological blockade of nmda receptors and genetic deletion of nmda receptor subunits both limit tolerance and oih after chronic morphine administration in mice and rats  <cit> . the nr2b subunits of nmda receptors are specifically involved in morphine tolerance  <cit> . likewise, morphine enhances the spinal expression and phosphorylation of camkii, and the spinal administration of camkii inhibitors reduces the tolerance and oih displayed in response to chronic morphine administration  <cit> . moreover, the enhanced activity of ampa channels has been demonstrated to play a role in morphine tolerance as well  <cit> . a central role for mupp <dig> in integrating synaptic nmda-camkii-ampa signaling has been demonstrated in hippocampal tissue  <cit> . while our results did not demonstrate any obvious effects of mupp <dig> sequence variation between two mouse strains with very different propensities to develop opioid maladaptations , the approximately 50 % lower synaptic levels of mupp <dig> in the 129svlm mice provide a plausible basis for reduced opioid maladaptation by this strain. consistent with this hypothesis, mpdz+/− mice, that also have about 50 % less cns mpdz mupp <dig> protein  <cit> , demonstrated less tolerance and oih in our experiments. thus the mapping result associating mpdz with tolerance and oih but not basal analgesic potency seems to fit well with our current understanding of maladaptations related to opioid use. beyond opioids, mpdz has been associated with alcohol and sedative dependence both in mouse and human genetic studies demonstrating that this gene may regulate chronic drug administration effects in multiple classes .

much work has been done on the mechanisms supporting tolerance, oih and other maladaptations to the use chronic use of opioids. these phenomena both limit the clinical utility of the drugs, and place patients at elevated risk of addiction and overdose. regretably we have no appraoches to delaying the onset or reducing the severity of the maladaptations. through whole-genome mapping utilizing a new fdr-corrected approach we have demonstrated, however, that novel mechanisms suporting opioid maladaptations can be discovered. we hope that by targeting the protein gene products or perhaps identifying other critical molecules in the involved signaling pathways, we might develop useful therapeutic approaches. in the case of mpdz/mupp <dig>  the central role of synaptic plasticity is highlighted. methods of disrupting protein-pdz interactions, excitatory amino acid signaling or possibly camkii activation may be plausible approaches.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that the mpdz gene helps to control key clinically relevant maladaptations to morphine administration in mice. the basis for the genetic effects may be related to differences in gene expression in spinal cord tissue as levels of mpdz expression varied between mouse strains, but the ability to interact with at least one important binding partner, camkii, did not. on the other hand, we have explored only the top-most gene candidate that resulted from our analyses. other highly ranked genes such as atrnl <dig> or chn <dig> might be pursued as well given there robust association with the maladaptive phenotypes under study. beyond opioid responses, however, these results suggest whole-genome hbcgm with appropriate fdr correction and the integration of results from the mapping of related phenotypes might provide insight into numerous phenotypes measurable in common strains of inbred mice.
