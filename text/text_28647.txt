BACKGROUND
actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the causative agent of porcine pleuropneumonia, a highly contagious respiratory disease that causes great economic losses worldwide  <cit> . transmission occurs through aerosol or close contact with infected animals or asymptomatic carriers, and can affect pigs of all ages  <cit> . in the acute phase, the disease is often lethal in  <dig> to  <dig> h, and leads to the formation of extensive fibrinohemorrhagic lung lesions. animals that survive the infection often become healthy carriers, and develop localized necrotizing lesions associated with pleuritis  <cit> . fifteen different serotypes can be identified based on differences in capsular polysaccharides. while serotypes  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> usually belong to biotype  <dig>  which contains strains that are nad-dependent, serotypes  <dig> and  <dig> are usually nad-independent and belong to biotype  <dig>  <cit> . however, biotype  <dig> variants of serotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have been reported  <cit> . despite years of research, mechanisms involved in a. pleuropneumoniae pathogenicity are still not fully understood. while many virulence factors have been identified, such as lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, apx toxins and iron acquisition systems  <cit> , or suggested, like biofilm formation  <cit> , autotransporter adhesin  <cit>  and autotransporter protease synthesis  <cit> , very little is known about the overall contribution of each component to the infection process.

in order to gain new insight into the disease, researchers have relied on techniques that allow for the identification of genes expressed in bacteria during infection of the host  <cit> , namely in vivo expression technology , signature tagged mutagenesis  and selective capture of transcribed sequences . first, an ivet experiment with a. pleuropneumoniae led to the identification of  <dig> loci  transcribed in vivo  <cit>  and highlighted the importance of genes involved in branched-chain amino acid  synthesis  <cit> . later, over the course of two stm experiments conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae, nearly  <dig> mutants were screened in vivo  <cit> . both experiments showed that iron acquisition was highly important for the virulence of a. pleuropneumoniae, with the identification of mutants impaired for the exbb-exbd-tonb energy-transducing system. the study by sheehan et al  <cit> , lead to the identification of a second set of exbb-exbd-tonb genes, and it was determined that inactivation of tonb <dig> and not tonb <dig> lead to attenuation in vivo  <cit> . more recently, scots experiments were conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae, at two different stages of infection: at the end of the acute stage, in necrotic lung tissues   <cit> , and in the chronic stage   <cit> . these studies demonstrated the importance of anaerobic metabolism and hlyx-regulated mechanisms during a. pleuropneumoniae infection in the lungs, and led to the identification and characterisation of a maturation autotransporter protease, aasp, responsible for cleavage and release of fragments of omla from the cell surface  <cit> . the hlyx regulon was characterized recently, and iron-regulated protein b  was identified as a potentially important virulence factor up-regulated when a. pleuropneumoniae is grown in oxygen-deprived environments  <cit> . although these in vivo studies have been very valuable in gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in a. pleuropneumoniae pathogenesis, limitations associated with the techniques used lead only to a partial overview of the transcriptional events taking place in vivo.

dna microarrays have been used to determine the complete transcriptomic profile of microorganisms in vitro, but technical drawbacks that are associated with the use of this technique in vivo, such as the qualitative and quantitative recovery of bacterial rna from host tissues, explain why the use of this technique to monitor bacterial infections has been limited  <cit> . while various cell culture, ex-vivo or mouse infection models have been used, in vivo experiments can provide more accurate information on bacterial adaptation and virulence when the natural host is studied. to the best of our knowledge, only two genome-wide transcriptional profiling experiments using dna microarrays have been conducted with bacterial pathogens in their natural host, during a natural infection. larocque et al. have evaluated the transcriptome of vibrio cholerae in the early and late stages of the disease by collecting stools of naturally infected patients  <cit> . son et al. used fresh sputum samples from a patient with cystic fibrosis to study the in vivo transcriptome of pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . additionally, agarwal et al. used a custom-made fur and iron regulon microarray to investigate the expression of these genes during gonococcal infection in women  <cit> .

in this study, we have conducted in vivo transcript profiling with dna microarrays of a. pleuropneumoniae during the acute phase of a natural infection in pigs. our results indicate that  <dig> genes are differentially expressed during the acute phase of infection in the host. of these,  <dig> were up-regulated, and three of these encode lipoproteins or omps that are well-conserved among strains of a. pleuropneumoniae.

RESULTS
animal samples
while working with samples from commercial herds means that we are working with disease cases that are representative of what is really happening in the field, it also means that limited amounts of material is available. during the course of our experiments, we were able to collect samples from three different animals from the same herd, before antibiotherapy was undertaken to eradicate the infection. all the animals that were sampled had presented symptoms of the disease for less than  <dig> h. two animals died as a result of the infection, and were sampled a few hours after death. those samples were not used for the microarray experiments since significant transcriptomic changes might have occurred between the time of death and the time of sampling. however, preliminary microscopic observations were made and our rna extraction protocol was tested with those samples. the last animal was euthanized on site by a veterinarian, and sampled less than  <dig> minutes after death. the infectious field strain was isolated from this animal. while it can be argued that different animals might react differently to an infection by a. pleuropneumoniae, and therefore elicit different transcriptional changes in the pathogen, we are confident that the results that were obtained reflect accurately the conditions encountered by a. pleuropneumoniae in its natural host following acute infection.

macroscopic and microscopic observations
clinical signs and macroscopic and microscopic examinations were consistent with acute porcine pleuropneumonia. clinical signs ranged from depression to respiratory distress, while macroscopic observation of deceased pigs revealed lobar fibrinohemorrhagic pleuropneumonia, along with necrotic lesions and the accumulation of bloody fluid in the thorax. on microscopic examination, multiple pulmonary necrotic areas surrounded by or containing oat cells were present, as well as fibrin accumulation in the alveolar lumen, interlobular septa and pleura . the infectious field strain that was isolated from the lung tissues was named 896- <dig>  and serotyping analysis showed that it belongs to serotype 5b, one of the most prevalent in north america  <cit> .

comparative genomic hybridizations
cgh experiments conducted previously in our laboratory have shown that the majority of genes in the reference 5b l <dig> strain were conserved in reference strains and fresh field isolates. conversely,  <dig> genes were identified as divergent in at least one strain, including  <dig> that are either phage or transposon related out of the  <dig> orfs represented on the microarray, which represents  <dig> % of divergent genes  <cit> . as anticipated, clusters of genes associated with lps/capsule biosynthesis and toxin production showed variations.

appchip <dig> was designed using the complete genome sequence from the serotype 5b reference strain l <dig>  in order to validate its use to assess transcriptomic events taking place with our infectious field strain during the infection, we first used it to analyze the gene content of the 896- <dig> field strain . the cgh data obtained with strain 896- <dig> was added to that obtained with other field and reference strains  <cit>  in order to generate a strain dendogram . serotyping data correlates well with genetic data since strain 896- <dig> forms a cluster with the serotype 5b reference strain l <dig>  the same clusters as those observed previously could be found in our dendrogram  <cit> .

only  <dig> genes were identified as divergent/absent in our field strain, when compared to the reference serotype 5b l <dig> strain . this represents only  <dig> % of all the genes  that are represented on appchip <dig>  <cit> . out of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> can be found in two major regions of the genome:  <dig> putative orfs code for phage structures, while  <dig> are located in the a. pleuropneumoniae tight adherence  locus. in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a close relative of a. pleuropneumoniae, the tad locus is involved in adherence to biological and abiological surfaces  <cit> . in a. pleuropneumoniae, genes from this locus were shown to be up-regulated during adhesion to lung epithelial cells in vitro  <cit> . the other important locus for gene divergence/absence was composed of phage-related features, and these were shown to be divergent during inter and intra-serotype comparisons in previous experiments  <cit> . some genes might also be present in the genome of strain 896- <dig> and absent in reference strain l <dig>  and therefore absent on appchip <dig> 

genes are ordered according to their location in the a. pleuropneumoniae genome . two important genomic regions  were found in this list: a phage region , and the tad locus .

r: genomic region. p: phage region. t: tad locus. o: other region

rna extraction
tissue samples were taken where lung lesions were present to ensure that bacterial yields would be optimal. a beadbeating step was performed prior to a standard hot acid-phenol-chloroform rna extraction protocol to extract bacterial rna from infected lung tissues. tissues were homogenized with  <dig>  mm zirconia/silica beads to release but not lyse bacterial cells from the tissue. this size of beads is too large to lyse bacterial cells . following homogenization, serial dilutions of the resulting supernatant were plated in order to determine an approximate number of cfu per gram of tissue. our results indicated that a. pleuropneumoniae could easily be isolated in pure culture from lung tissues of all animals, and that the number of cfu varied from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> per gram of infected tissue. centrifugation of homogenized samples enabled the removal of most cellular debris and the recovery of bacteria. approximately  <dig> to  <dig> μg of total rna could routinely be extracted from approximately  <dig> g of necrotic lung tissue, with no apparent contamination by eukaryotic rna, as observed on agarose gel when using bacterial rna extracted from bhi broth and eukaryotic rna recovered from porcine lung epithelial cells   <cit>  as on-gel controls . nevertheless, the microbenrich kit was still used to remove any possible trace of remaining eukaryotic rna, and treatments with turbodnase removed traces of contaminating dna. no trace of bacterial or host dna could be detected following pcr amplification with primers for gene ompw and for pig mitochondrial dna. we propose that this combination of techniques could prove useful in isolating pathogens from other tissues as well.

in vivo transcript profiling
before investigating the in vivo transcript profile of a. pleuropneumoniae, we used self-self hybridizations in order to quantifiy the dye bias effect after hybridization on appchip <dig>  duplicate experiments showed a r <dig> correlation factor of  <dig>  between the intensity detected for the cy <dig> labelled and cy <dig> labelled probes, and only two genes seemed to qualify as obvious outliers . both genes, apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig>  were not identified as differentially expressed during the course of a natural infection.

while designing the microarray experiments, growth in bhi medium to an optical density of  <dig>  at a  <dig> nm wavelenght was chosen as our reference condition. this condition was not only chosen for practical reasons, but also to fulfill two precise objectives: first, to allow for the identification of genes that, while important to the infection process, have not been identified previously in vitro in rich medium, and second, to allow comparison of the results obtained in vivo to those obtained in our laboratory in other growth conditions by keeping the same reference  <cit> . working with a limited amount of biological material meant that only one time-point in the infection could be investigated. in the acute stage of porcine pleuropneumonia, bacteria are likely in the exponential phase of growth. this is also the case in the control condition. the transcriptome of a. pleuropneumonia is certainly very different when the infection is in the chronic stage. therefore, while our results are an accurate representation of the transcriptomic events that occur in vivo during the acute phase of the infection process as compared to those occuring in vitro in a rich culture medium, events occuring earlier of later in the infection process cannot be inferred.

in vivo transcript profiling experiments were performed on samples from three different lesion sites on the euthanized pig. since this pig was euthanized on site by a veterinarian, the time laps between the death of the animal and tissue sampling was kept to a minimum. following microarray hybridization and analysis,  <dig> % of all coding sequences included on appchip <dig> could be detected during our experiments, and  <dig> genes were significantly differentially expressed in vivo when their level of expression was compared to that seen in vitro, with a fdr of  <dig> % over the course of three hybridizations:  <dig> of these were up-regulated, while  <dig> were down-regulated. functional classification of these genes revealed that up-regulated genes mostly belonged to the "transport and binding proteins" and "energy metabolism" classes, with respectively  <dig> and  <dig> genes . repressed genes mostly belonged to the "protein synthesis", "energy metabolism" and "cell envelope" functional classes. a large number of genes encoding "hypothetical/unknown/unclassified" products were differentially expressed. only ten out of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes  could be found in the list of divergent or highly divergent/absent genes in at least one reference strain of a. pleuropneumoniae, as established by gouré et al.  <cit> . three of these are involved in surface structures, namely lps and capsule, biosynthesis , and two others are found in phage-associated regions . of the last five genes, four are divergent in only one strain , and the apl_ <dig> gene codes for a hypothetical protein that is divergent in serotype  <dig>  7- <dig> and  <dig> reference strains.

a) validation of microarray results by qrt-pcr
in order to confirm results obtained using the appchip <dig> a. pleuropneumoniae microarray, eleven genes were selected for qrt-pcr analysis. five of these were up-regulated in vivo  and six were down-regulated . these genes represented a large range of log <dig> ratio values. in all cases, microarray results were supported by those obtained by qrt-pcr: all genes that were identified as up-regulated using the appchip <dig> also showed up-regulation following qrt-pcr analysis, and the same was true for selected down-regulated genes .

b) comparison with other in vivo studies
among previous in vivo experiments that were conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae, the one that was closest to ours in terms of experimental conditions and results was by baltes et al <cit> . in their experiment, selective capture of transcribed sequences  was performed on lung tissues after a  <dig> day infection with a. pleuropneumoniae , and  <dig> genes were identified  <cit> . of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes that we have identified ,  <dig> were also identified in other in vivo studies conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae : only  <dig> of these were up-regulated following transcript profiling in vivo. these include  <dig> genes already identified by baltes et al. using scots at the end of the acute stage of the disease  <cit> : fuci, encoding the l-fucose isomerase, nrdd, encoding an anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase, and apxiva, encoding the apxiva toxin structural protein. the latter, the gene encoding the recently discovered fourth a. pleuropneumoniae apx toxin  <cit> , had only been detected in vivo  <cit>  until it was discovered recently that it is also up-regulated after contact with broncho-alveolar lavage fluids  <cit> . it is also the only apx gene that was up-regulated in our experiment, but it is worth noting that the apxibcd and apxiiab genes, although not differentially expressed, were all actively transcribed in vivo. finally, the last gene that was up-regulated in our study and identified in another in vivo study is nane, which codes for a putative n-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase, an enzyme involved in the use of n-acetylneuraminate and n-acetylmannosamine as carbon sources  <cit> . the differences between our results and those obtained in other in vivo studies can be easily explained: while the second scots experiment was conducted with animals suffering from chronic infections  <cit> , a condition which differs greatly from our field case, the stm and ivet techniques do not provide a "snap-shot" of the transcriptome at a precise time point during the infection process. while stm and ivet can theoretically provide a global overview of transcriptomic events, the experiments conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae are not likely to have achieved this goal. only  <dig> mutants were screened by fuller et al. with ivet  <cit> , well short of the approximately  <dig> genes of the a. pleuropneumoniae genome, and although sheehan et al. screened  <dig> mutants using stm  <cit> , the authors noted that both their stm screen and the previous stm experiment by fuller et al.  <cit>  were likely not saturating. stm relies on transposon mutagenesis, and there are some insertional hot spots in the a. pleuropneumoniae genome  <cit> .

tp: results obtained during transcript profiling

↑:up-regulated

↓:down-regulated

we also compared our results to the transcriptional profile of a virulent strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa, another lung pathogen, isolated from a chronically infected cystic fibrosis patient  <cit> . there were no striking similarities when comparing the functions of differentially expressed genes in both studies. since p. aeruginosa is well-known for the versatility of nutrients it can use for growth, and since both conditions  were highly different, this was to be expected. however, one interesting aspect of both cases was the list of genes that weren't up-regulated as predicted. as with son et al., we noticed that few of the landmark virulence genes in a. pleuropneumoniae were up-regulated in vivo. out of the three apx toxins present in serotype 5b, only the gene encoding the apxiv toxin was up-regulated. the hsf autotransporter homolog, thought to be important in adhesion processes, as well as pga genes necessary for biofilm formation, were not identified either.

well-characterized iron acquisition genes such as those coding for the hemoglobin receptor hgba  and the genes coding for transferrin binding proteins tbpa and tbpb did no show differential expression, nor did genes involved in anaerobic respiration. while in the latter case it can be argued that the environmental conditions encountered during the acute infection might explain why differential expression of these gene transcripts was not observed, it could also be hypothesized that years of evolution of the field strain in nature might have led to the loss of some regulatory mechanisms that could still be present in well-characterized laboratory strains, thereby leading to the constitutive expression of some important virulence genes. in the case of the p. aeruginosa clinical isolate, it was shown that more than  <dig> genes had higher levels of constitutive expression in the clinical isolate than in a well-characterised reference strain, therefore showing the deregulation of several pathways  <cit> . whether this is also the case for a. pleuropneumoniae will have to be assessed.

c) down-regulated genes
interestingly, genes involved in protein synthesis were down-regulated in vivo towards the end of the acute phase of the disease. a total of  <dig> different 30s or 50s ribosomal genes showed levels of down-regulation ranging from - <dig>  to - <dig>  fold. these genes are scattered in the l <dig> genome, but all their respective operonic structures are well conserved when compared to those observed in e. coli  <cit> . not much is known, however, about the regulation of these transcriptional units. while some experimental evidence seems to indicate that rpsj could be activated by fnr  <cit>  and repressed by arca  <cit> , rpst seems to be repressed by fnr  <cit> . both rpsk and rpsu are transcribed from σ  <dig> promoters, which is the main sigma factor during the exponential growth phase  <cit> . this would probably indicate that a. pleuropneumoniae has a slower metabolism and replication rate in vivo than when it is growing in a rich culture medium. further strengthening this hypothesis is the fact that two subunits from dna polymerase iii , which is the primary enzyme for replicative dna functions in e. coli, are down-regulated, as well the genes coding for the dna primase  and the cell division protein ftsx.

with regards to their possible involvement in virulence processes, some genes that were down-regulated were of particular interest. the fur transcriptional regulator, which represses transcription of genes associated with iron acquisition  <cit> , showed a  <dig>  fold down-regulation in transcription. in bacteria, fur down-regulates the transcription of genes involved in iron-acquisition and iron homeostasis in bacterial cells, and its action is directly linked to the amount of available iron, as it requires fe2+ as a cofactor  <cit> . in e. coli, fur also regulates its own level of expression. iron restriction if often thought to be an important signal for bacteria, and has often been linked with the expression of virulence factors such as toxins  <cit> . therefore, it would seem that the in vivo environment towards the end of the acute phase of pleuropneumonia is not iron-restricted for a. pleuropneumoniae. this is not surprising considering that there is extensive hemorrhage and tissue destruction, caused most probably by the secretion of apx toxins. however, a few genes involved in iron acquisition, namely apl_ <dig>  apl_ <dig>  hbpa and irp, were up-regulated. since these genes were not identified in a previous transcript profiling experiment under iron-restricted conditions  <cit> , this might imply that they are not regulated by fur. the hfq gene, which codes for a protein involved in rna molecule stability and rna-rna interactions  <cit>  and that therefore has an important regulatory function, was also down-regulated. hfq is an rna chaperone that acts as a post-transcriptional riboregulator  <cit> . the role of hfq, a sm-like protein, has been investigated with greater interest over the last decade since it was shown that it is involved in the function of small rnas   <cit> . it is believed to form a complex with srnas and rnase e, thereby targeting mrnas that are recognized by srnas for degradation. the fact that the hfq gene is down-regulated in vivo at the end of the acute phase of the disease could lead to a decline of the activity of srnas that require hfq to function properly. no srnas have been identified in a. pleuropneumoniae yet, but they have been found in numerous bacterial pathogens  <cit> .

also of interest was the down-regulation of the cps5b  and cpxc  genes, involved respectively in the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharide and in the export of these polysaccharides. down-regulation of cpxabc, involved in capsule biosynthesis, has also been observed during planktonic life in liquid medium in contact with porcine lung epithelial cells  <cit> . the down-regulation of genes involved in capsule synthesis could potentially lead to the production of a thinner capsule on the surface of bacteria, thereby unmasking potential adhesins. indeed, an acapsular mutant of a. pleuropneumoniae that was generated in our laboratory was shown to adhere more strongly to frozen porcine tracheal sections than the capsulated wild-type strain  <cit> .

d) up-regulated genes
numerous genes that could be involved in the progression of the disease were identified as up-regulated. gene sohb has the highest observed fold change  and codes for a putative secreted serine protease that seems to be well conserved in other pathogenic bacteria, such as haemophilus parasuis, neisseria meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. in the lungs, a. pleuropneumoniae causes extensive tissue damage that could result from the combined action of apx toxins and secreted proteases  <cit> .

adhesion processes are essential for the establishment of bacterial infections. the apf promoter was shown to be active in vitro during adhesion experiments to primary epithelial cells, and in vivo early in the infection process  <cit> . here, we report that genes apfb and apfc, coding for the type iv pilin biogenesis proteins apfb and apfc, were up-regulated in vivo during natural infection by an a. pleuropneumoniae isolate. type iv fimbriae, although primarily involved in promoting the attachment to biotic or abiotic surfaces, are also involved in many other processes, including dna uptake, biofilm formation and twitching mobility  <cit> . interestingly, another gene that could share similar functions was also up-regulated. apl_ <dig> codes for a member of the cscg superfamily of proteins involved in the assembly of curli fibers. curli fibers are important for biofilm formation in numerous pathogens, including e. coli and salmonella enteritidis, and are involved in the first steps of attachment. curli-deficient strains tend to form flat biofilms  <cit> . cscg is the outer membrane protein that is responsible for the secretion of the curli structural subunits, and the cscg gene is generally found within an operon composed of the genes cscdefg. in a. pleuropneumoniae l <dig>  this organization is not respected: apl_ <dig> seems to form an operon with the genes apl_ <dig> and apl_ <dig>  neither of these two other genes shares homology with known csc genes. finally, the kpsf gene, coding for an arabinose-5-phosphate isomerase, should also be mentioned since it is involved in the pathway responsible for the synthesis of 2-keto-3deozyoctulosonic acid , which is present in the a. pleuropneumoniae lps core oligosaccharide  <cit>  and capsule of serotype  <dig>  <cit> . studies in our laboratory have shown that it is the core oligosaccharide that is responsible for the previously observed lps-associated adhesion mechanism  <cit> .

two operon structures that were up-regulated in vivo during the acute phase of the disease could give some insight into the environment the bacteria encounters in the host, and are the main reason why the "transport and binding protein" functional class is so prominently represented in our list of up-regulated genes. genes from the maltose operon, involved in the uptake and catabolism of maltose  <cit> , were up-regulated: the genes malp, malk, malf, malg, malq and a malm homolog  were actively transcribed in the host , and gene lamb <dig>  which codes for a maltoporin, showed a  <dig>  fold change in the only hybridization in which the reporter wasn't manually flagged because of signal saturation. in e. coli, the mal genes are essential for the transport and utilization of maltose and maltodextrin  <cit> . although it is not known whether maltose or maltodextrin are readily available as carbohydrate sources in mammalian lungs, it was previously shown that maltodextrin utilization is important for the colonization of the oro-pharynx in group a streptococcus  <cit> . it was also recently shown that catabolism of maltose provides a competitive advantage to pathogenic and commensal e. coli strains in the gut  <cit> . meanwhile, genes from the ula operon , coding for a pts transport system for ascorbate, showed an average fold change of  <dig> . in e. coli, these genes are responsible for the transport and utilization of ascorbate in anaerobic conditions  <cit> . while ascorbate use has not been linked to bacterial virulence before, it has been shown on multiple occasions that genes involved in anaerobic metabolism are important for the virulence of a. pleuropneumoniae  <cit> . in pigs lungs, following extensive infection and tissue destruction, the bacteria are likely to face oxygen deprivation. a few other genes that are involved in anaerobic metabolism were up-regulated. the hybb gene codes for hydrogenase  <dig>  a nickel-containing enzyme thought to be responsible for h2-dependent reduction of quinone under anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and fumarate reductase subunit c, respectively encoded by genes pepc and frdc, are also required during anaerobic growth. however, other genes related to anaerobic metabolism and that were previously shown to be important in vivo  <cit> , namely dmsa, aspa and hlyx, were not found in our list of differentially expressed genes. the dmsa gene did show a mean fold change of  <dig>  over two successful hybridizations, but hlyx had a mean fold change of - <dig>  over three successful hybridizations. however, neither of these changes were deemed statistically significant. this suggests that hlyx is probably not highly expressed during the acute phase of the disease caused by a. pleuropneumoniae. accordingly, of  <dig> genes in our list that were previously shown to be up-regulated directly or indirectly by hlyx under anaerobiosis,  <dig>  were down-regulated in vivo, while only  <dig>  were up-regulated.

two genes coding for proteins with regulatory functions were found to be up-regulated. the phor gene codes for the phosphate regulon phor sensing protein, located in the inner membrane. in e. coli, this protein is part of a two-component regulatory system that responds to periplasmic orthophosphate concentration variations  <cit> . the phosphate regulon in e. coli controls the expression of at least  <dig> genes, and has been shown to be involved in virulence. numerous phor, phob  and pts  mutants were found to be less virulent or avirulent when compared to wild-type strains, with phenotypes such as increased sensitivity to serum, acidity and cationic antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  and reduced colonization  <cit> . a. pleuropneumoniae strain l <dig> harbours an operon composed of the genes ptsscab-phobr. although only phor was deemed significantly up-regulated, all other genes showed levels of variations ranging from a  <dig> - to 2-fold increase. since it seems unlikely that porcine lungs are devoid of phosphate, the a. pleuropneumoniae phobr system might be important in order to adapt correctly to changing conditions inside the host. another gene coding for a member of a two-component system was up-regulated: gene apl_ <dig> codes for a cpxa homolog. in different epec and upec strains, the cpxar system was found to important for the correct folding and assembly of pili subunits  <cit> . however, the l <dig> cpxa homolog seems to either be truncated, or found on two separate gene loci. this seems to be the case since cpxa is found down-stream of cpxr , and gene apl_ <dig> is a hypothetical two-component sensor protein with a histidine-kinase domain.

e) up-regulated genes which are conserved and predicted to code for omps or lipoproteins
the main goal of our experiment was to identify genes that were expressed in vivo during infection of the natural host. we were also interested by genes showing high-level of sequence conservation among different field and reference strains  <cit> , and coding for proteins predicted to localize to the outer membrane  <cit> . three genes satisfied those criteria: two that are coding for outer membrane proteins , and one coding for a lipoprotein  .

the irp  gene codes for a predicted tonb-dependant receptor, possibly involved in hemin transport. however, since this was deduced from sequence homologies, the real function of irp in a. pleuropneumoniae cannot be reliably inferred, but it is conserved in various bacterial pathogens. interestingly, the irp gene is located directly next to apl_ <dig>  a conserved lipoprotein in the l <dig> genome although they are transcribed in opposite directions. the protein sequence deduced from the apl_ <dig> gene sequence is present in all sequenced a. pleuropneumoniae strains and in mannheimia haemolytica phl <dig>  but no other strong homologies can be found in other bacterial species.

the apl_ <dig> gene codes for a hypothetical hemagglutinin/hemolysin-like outer membrane protein. the protein sequence deduced from the gene sequence shares approximately 30% identity with different large sections of the filamentous hemagglitinin/adhesin  from bacteria of the bordetella genus, which also colonize the respiratory tract of various mammalian hosts. while it was first identified for its hemagglutination properties  <cit> , fha can bind carbohydrates, heparan sulphate and integrin  <cit> . it is the most important adhesin in b. pertussis, and deletion of fha in b. bronchiseptica, another important swine respiratory pathogen, caused lower colonization than the wild-type strain at all respiratory tract sites tested with was unable to cause disease <cit> . the a. pleuropneumoniae fha homolog is conserved amongst all field and reference strains previously tested  <cit> , and was predicted to locate to the outer membrane  <cit> . in b. bronchiseptica, fhab is believed to be important early in the infection process in order to allow colonization of the ciliated epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract. in histophilus somni, the fhab homolog is thought to also have an important role in biofilm formation in cases of myocarditis caused by this micro-organism  <cit> . up-regulation of the a. pleuropneumoniae fhab homolog during the acute phase of the disease hints at a similar role for this adhesin in the establishment of pleuropneumonia. surprisingly, this gene was not identified as up-regulated in previous adhesion experiments performed in our lab  <cit> , and it even showed a slight, although not significant, down-regulation when a. pleuropneumoniae adhered to immortalized lung epithelial cells. this can either reflect differences in regulatory events between a freshly isolated field strain and a well-conserved and characterized laboratory strain, or simply that in vitro experiments, however carefully designed they may be, can never really completely reproduce complex in vivo environments.

despite years of research, an efficient cross-serotype vaccine that can prevent porcine pleuropneumonia has yet to be successfully produced. to generate a vaccine that provides good cross-serotype protection against porcine pleuropneumonia, one would most probably have to include antigens that are conserved amongst all serotypes that the host could encounter and be surface-exposed. the three proteins that are encoded by genes fhab, irp and apl_ <dig> have all these features, and might therefore represent good candidates to include in future cross-serotype vaccines against a. pleuropneumoniae. fha of b. pertussis is present in various combined diphteria-tetanus-pertussis  acellular vaccines. these vaccines have been successfully used to prevent whopping cough and have contributed to a considerable decrease in the number of cases registered per year  <cit> . thus the a. pleuropneumonie fhab homolog represents an excellent candidate to include in a future pleuropneumonia vaccine that could actually lead to efficient protection against this important swine pathogen.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first and only genome-wide in vivo gene expression experiment to be conducted with a. pleuropneumoniae in its natural host, the pig, following a natural infection. of the  <dig> genes that we could identify as differentially expressed,  <dig> showed greater levels of expression in vivo at the end of the acute phase of the disease than in a rich culture medium, while  <dig> were repressed. by comparing our results to those obtained following comparative genomics and proteomics experiments, we were able to identify three genes that were conserved in tested reference strains and in fresh field isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae, and these were also predicted to code for outer membrane proteins or lipoproteins. these three genes, namely fhab , irp  and apl_ <dig>  could all represent excellent candidates for the development of a protective cross-serotype subunit vaccine against a. pleuropneumoniae.

while our results can help decipher some of the adaptations a. pleuropneumoniae has to make once it infects the host, much more research is necessary in order to understand the whole picture of the disease. the acute stage and the chronic stage of the disease are probably highly different conditions, and it would be interesting in future works to compare our present data with the transcriptomic profile of a. pleuropneumoniae during a chronic infection.
