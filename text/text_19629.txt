BACKGROUND
many hormones and growth factors stimulate phospholipase c by activating its receptor. this activation results in the production of diacylglycerol  at the plasma membrane, which triggers the activation of several enzymes, such as chimerins
 <cit> , ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein 
 <cit> , transient receptor potential cation channel c 
 <cit> , and both conventional and novel pkcs
 <cit> . dg kinase  phosphorylates dg to produce phosphatidic acid , resulting in the inhibition of dg-mediated intracellular signal transduction. additionally, pa is a lipid second messenger that regulates various target proteins, including atypical pkc, mtor, and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase
 <cit> . thus, dgk plays pivotal roles in various intracellular signaling pathways by regulating the dg and pa levels
 <cit> . ten dgk isoforms have been identified in mammal, and classified into five subtypes, from i to v, based on similarities in the domain structures.

the physiologic roles of dgk isoforms have been partially elucidated by analyses of dgk gene expression patterns and of genetically modified organisms. for example, dgkβ is a major isoform expressed in the brain, and the disruption of this isoform impairs memory and causes antidepressant-like effects in mice
 <cit> . in contrast, dgkα enhances interleukin 2-induced t cell proliferation
 <cit> , and knockout  mice exhibit impaired induction of t cell anergy
 <cit> . another isoform, dgkζ is a type iv dgk that is ubiquitously expressed in most mouse tissues. dgkζ ko mice exhibit abnormalities in multiple tissues, including a decrease in the number of dendritic spines, and an impairment of the immune response
 <cit> . in regard to nervous system, a large number of studies have shown the roles of dgks in neuronal spine density, synaptic activity, epileptogenesis and neuronal plasticity in mammals
 <cit>  and c. elegans used as a genetic model
 <cit> . it is not clear the relationships of ten dgk isoforms in mammal. to better understand the role of each dgk and its redundancy among the dgk family, further studies in other subtypes of dgks are necessary.

dgkθ was originally cloned from the rat brain and identified as the sole type v dgk
 <cit> . dgkθ contains three c <dig> domains and a ras-association  domain in the central region. studies have shown that dgkθ is enriched in the nuclear matrix of various cultured cell lines
 <cit> , is negatively regulated by its interaction with the small gtpase rhoa
 <cit> , and translocate to the plasma membrane following phosphorylation by pkcϵ
 <cit> . the optimal activation of dgkθ may require both polybasic protein and acidic phospholipid cofactors, which have been shown to stimulate dgkθ synergistically in vitro <cit> . these multiple regulatory mechanisms enable dgkθ to mediate signals from a wide variety of extracellular ligands
 <cit>  including epidermal growth factor
 <cit> , nerve growth factor
 <cit> , α-thrombin
 <cit> , and adenosine
 <cit> .

dgkθ is highly expressed in rat brain
 <cit>  and is present in a variety of cultured cell lines
 <cit> . however, there is limited information regarding this enzyme’s cell type-specific functions or its physiological roles in mammals. in this study, we examined the distribution and changes in expression from e <dig> to e <dig> to reveal the spatial and temporal expression of dgkθ protein in mouse embryos.

RESULTS
expression patterns of dgkθ in e <dig>  to e <dig>  mouse embryos
to determine the distribution of dgkθ, we performed immunohistochemistry  on paraffin sections of mouse embryos. we used two individual antibodies that target the c-terminal region of the protein, anti-dgkθ antibodies # <dig> and # <dig>  to validate immunostaining patterns. both antibodies detected a major 110-kda band of dgkθ on an immunoblotting membrane containing the extract from whole brain , in which dgkθ had been detected with rt-pcr . the observed molecular size coincided with the size of endogenous protein  in hek <dig> and hela cell lysates by immunoblotting
 <cit> . the specificity of this antibody was further confirmed by the transient transfection. these antibodies successfully detected exogenously expressed recombinant dgkθ protein by immunofluorescence in hela cells, but not other subtypes .

at e <dig> , the immunoreactivity of dgkθ was noticeable along the surface of the forebrain , rhombencephalon , and neural tube  , and was also distinctly observable in the ectodermal epithelium of the hind bud   . dgkθ expression was also detected in the branchial arch , bulbus cordis , hepatic primordium , midgut artery , and notal cord  . a similar staining pattern persisted at e <dig> . immunoreactivity of dgkθ was detected in the bulbus cordis, liver , and lumen of the stomach and midgut  . in addition to the distribution observed at e <dig> , dgkθ staining was noted in the tongue , nasal placode , primitive bronchi , the dorsal root ganglion , and the trachea  separating from the esophagus at e <dig>  . it is noteworthy that the immunoreactivity significantly increased in the neuroepithelium surrounding the third ventricle  at e <dig>  compared with that at e <dig>  . in contrast to the faint staining of the mesenchymal cells around the cephalic region, the immunoreactivity of the mesenchymal cells around the peripheries of the tongue  and nasal placode  was relatively high .

the embryonic brain grows rapidly until e <dig> , and the forebrain partly divides into the telencephalon  and diencephalon . simultaneously, a pharynx membrane and respiratory apparatus rapidly develop. in the current study, at e <dig>  the immunoreactivity in the cephalic region increased intensively at the rostral side of the telencephalon, the tectum of midbrain, and the pontine flexure  in which neuroepithelial cells proliferate . furthermore, the immunoreactivity persisted or increased in multiple organs  , and expanded to the surface layer of the nasal cavity and dental lamina  . a similar pattern of distribution was observed at e <dig>  .

in the developing central nervous system region at e <dig> , dgkθ immunoreactivity was widely distributed in all brain regions. particularly dense immunoreactivity was observed in the neocortex , epithalamus , medulla oblongata , and the gray horn of spinal cord . however, dgkθ was not detected in the ganglionic eminence , which localizes to the medial side of the lateral ventricle . in other areas, dense immunoreactivity was continually detected within various types of epithelia, including the tongue , tooth bud , nasal cavity , bronchus , midgut , and urogenital sinus  . in contrast to the immunoreactivity predominantly observed in the epithelia classified as simple or stratified epithelium, dgkθ protein was undetectable in the endothelial cells of the arterial trunk . beginning at e <dig> , the fetal skin increased in thickness and formed the layer of the squamous epithelium. at the facial and dorsal surfaces we found a significant increase of immunoreactivity in the squamous epithelial cells, which successively differentiate into epidermis . ihc without the dgkθ antibody failed to detect any signal in the sections from e <dig>  to e <dig>  .

expression patterns of dgkθ in late stages of embryogenesis
at e <dig> , the immunoreactivity of dgkθ was maintained in the neocortex  and the mesencephalon , and increased in the villi  and mucosa  of the intestine  and the basal layer  of the dorsal skin  . in contrast, we found that the immunoreactivity of dgkθ was attenuated in the lung  and liver at e <dig> . at prenatal developmental stages , dgkθ immunoreactivity was unchanged in the brain region relative to the e <dig> . in other areas, immunoreactivity was faintly observed in the enamel epithelium of incisor teeth , the epidermis of the facial and dorsal surfaces , the walls of the tranche and main bronchus, and the ventricular wall of the heart , while strong signals persisted in the villi and mucosa of the intestine  and in the collecting tubule  and bowman’s capsule  of the kidney . the intensity and pattern of the immunoreactivity was also verified by examining serial sections with two different anti-dgkθ  . when the anti-dgkθ antibody was preincubated with the blocking polypeptide prior to ihc, no immunostaining was detected at e <dig>  with the exception of the pancreas  and the surface of the villi in the duodenum, which corresponded with ihc results obtained without the primary antibody .

rt-pcr analysis of dgkθ expression in mouse embryos
to confirm the distribution of dgkθ, we analyzed the expression of the dgkθ mrna at e <dig>  using semiquantitative rt-pcr. the results demonstrated that dgkθ was expressed in multiple organs  at e <dig> . additionally, dgkθ was expressed more abundantly in the brain and dorsal skin than in the other organs . this expression profile of the mrna is consistent with the immunohistochemical observation, which indicated that dgkθ was distributed among various epithelia and neurons at e <dig> .

to examine the change in dgkθ expression during development, we analyzed the expression in dorsal skin from e <dig>  until adulthood. in the developmental skin, the expression of dgkθ was significantly higher at e <dig>  than at e <dig>  and during adulthood .

discussion
to examine the regional distribution of dgkθ during the embryonic period, we performed immunohistochemistry  on whole mouse embryos. the immunostaining patterns indicated dgkθ protein was widely expressed in multiple organs and abundantly expressed in the brain and dorsal skin of mouse embryos. these results were confirmed by the analysis of dgkθ mrna using rt-pcr and in situ hybridization . the ihc results demonstrated that the expression of dgkθ significantly increased in the neuroepithelium surrounding the neural tube and ventricles in the brain. prominent immunoreactivity of dgkθ was observed in a variety of neurons in the gestational brain over the period examined . especially, dgkθ was detected in the marginal zone of the neocortex, but not in the medial side of the lateral ventricle at e <dig>  and e <dig> . since developing mammalian telencephalon is known to require atypical pkc
 <cit> , these results may suggest that dgkθ is associated with differentiation of the neuronal lineage or the locomotion of immature neurons
 <cit> . during the prenatal period , dgkθ was expressed in the developing cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. this distribution pattern is consistent with the in situ hybridization data for the adult rat brain
 <cit> . other dgk isoforms are known to be expressed in the postnatal brain
 <cit>  and are needed for various roles of mature neurons
 <cit> . c.elegans dgk- <dig>  which has 39% identity to mouse dgkθ, regulates dag levels generated by heterotrimeric g protein signaling in response to the neurotransmitters in nematode
 <cit> . genetic analysis of c.elegans, dgk- <dig> shows the role of dopamine controlled locomotion and serotonin-controlled egg-laying behavior
 <cit> . the presence of dgkθ throughout the prenatal brain at e <dig>  suggests either that dgkθ is involved in a common neuronal process, or that it provides a level of redundancy for other dgk isoforms in neurons
 <cit> .

in the periphery, ihc results revealed that dgkθ is ubiquitously expressed in the layer of multiple organs during the embryonic period. in the intestine and kidney, the expression of dgkθ was prominent and persisted from e <dig>  up to e <dig> , while dgkθ expression in the lung, liver, and oropharyngeal membrane surrounding the tongue and nasal cavity was transient and attenuated before birth. since dgkθ enhances the activation of egf receptor stimulated with egf via the counteraction of pkc activity in epidermoid cells
 <cit> , dgkθ may notably contribute to the development of epithelial cells during organogenesis . rt-pcr analysis demonstrated that the dgkθ mrna was expressed in abundance throughout the developmental process, with highest expression in multiple key organs. thus, dgkθ may have persistent roles in diverse organs and tissues during the embryonic stages.

CONCLUSIONS
we revealed for the first time the distribution of dgkθ during the embryonic period. these results suggest that dgkθ may play important physiological roles not only in the brain, but also in diverse organs and tissues during the embryonic stages, and will serve as a basis for future in vivo genetic, functional, and mutational analyses of dgkθ.
