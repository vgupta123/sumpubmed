BACKGROUND
open chromatin is a characteristic of genomic loci with regulatory functions. these regions are preferentially digested by dnasei  <cit> , and the identification of dnasei hypersensitive sites is frequently used to identify and analyse regulatory regions such as promoters, enhancers and silencers  <cit> . however, currently available methods have significant limitations. a commonly used approach involves southern blotting, but this is time consuming, usually requires radioactivity and is limited to short stretches of dna. several pcr-based methods have been described  <cit> , but these do not readily allow multiplexing. recent reports of large scale analysis of dnasei hypersensitive sites have used either microarrays  <cit>  or deep sequencing  <cit> . whilst valuable for genome wide analysis, the costs involved are a limiting factor for many applications . another disadvantage of those methods is that they usually require many millions of cells. for ex vivo studies, this might require extensive pooling of tissues, meaning that these methods are not suitable for all applications.

multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification  was originally developed to detect deletions and duplications in genomic dna  <cit> , and has become popular in diagnostic settings for a range of disorders  <cit> . it has since been modified for several other applications as well, including methylation analysis  <cit> , mrna expression analysis  <cit> , identifying copy number variation in normal populations  <cit> , genotyping of mouse models  <cit>  and measuring the efficiency of cre-mediated recombination in mouse models  <cit> . the principle advantages of this method are the sensitivity and multiplexing potential. it can be used to analyse up to  <dig> genomic loci with as little as  <dig> ng genomic dna in a single reaction. furthermore, the only equipment that is required is a thermocycler and dna sequencer, readily available to most researchers.

we describe here a quick and straightforward protocol for analysing dnasei hypersensitive sites. this is demonstrated by the analysis of  <dig> different loci in a single reaction, based on data published by the encode consortium  <cit> .

RESULTS
probe design
nuclei isolation and dnasei treatment
we tested different methods for the isolation of nuclei, with the ne-per kit  found to be most suitable. although intended for the isolation and separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, it proved to be useful for the isolation of nuclei. another obstacle to overcome was the isolation of the genomic dna. this approach requires efficient recovery of very long as well as very short fragments of genomic dna. unfortunately, dna obtained using the standard method for this task, phenol-chloroform purification, is not suitable for use with mlpa, as traces of phenol are known to interfere with the enzymatic reactions. instead we used the highpure pcr purification kit , which, according to the manufacturer, is suitable for the isolation of fragments of up to  <dig> kb. as expected, in our experiments the recovery of dna from the untreated and therefore most intact sample, was often least efficient, however, the quality and quantity of the dna was still sufficient for mlpa analysis. figure  <dig> shows a typical example of digested dna obtained after treating isolated nuclei with increasing amounts of dnasei and purification.

analysis of dnasei hypersensitive sites in hela cells
we next used the same probe mix to analyse the dnasei hypersensitivity of dna within intact nuclei of hela cells. figure 3a shows typical peak patterns obtained using nuclei aliquots digested with increasing amounts of dnasei. several peaks show significantly decreased peak height with increased dnasei concentration, while others remain virtually unchanged. nine of  <dig> probes targeting previously described dnasei hypersensitive sites in hela cells show a clear decrease in normalized peak heights , whereas all nine probes targeting non-sensitive loci show no significant decrease . these results were highly reproducible, with the technical and biological replicates giving an r <dig> >  <dig> .

we also tested the same probe mix on dna directly isolated from hela cells. as can be seen in figure 3c, there are no significant changes in normalized peak heights with increasing dnasei digestion. this was expected as these dna samples should have no chromatin structure, and all cuts by dnasei should therefore occur in a random fashion.

comparison of results using other cell lines
we then analysed the same  <dig> loci for dnasei hypersensitivity in other cell lines. for this comparison we used hek <dig>  c <dig> and s <dig> cells. while the results for c <dig> cells were very similar to those of hela cells , we could identify differences in sensitivity for several probes in hek <dig> and s <dig> cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  some probes identifying hypersensitive sites in hela cells stay unchanged in the other cell lines  and two of the probes not showing the expected sensitivity in hela cells  do show sensitivity in hek <dig> cells.

determining the minimum cell number
we also tried to determine the minimum cell number that could be used with this approach. as we were able to obtain robust results and sufficient dna for several replicates from aliquots containing nuclei from about  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells, we estimated the lower limit of required cells to be around  <dig> ×  <dig> . to confirm this number, we used aliquots of  <dig> ×  <dig> hela cells and treated them as described above and compared the results with those obtained from experiments using  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per aliquot. figure  <dig> shows the comparison of results from  <dig> ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells .

discussion
we describe here a simple technique that allows the rapid analysis of many dnasei hypersensitive sites using little starting material. for a proof of principle we chose loci that had been analysed by both array analysis and deep sequencing as part of the encode project  <cit> .

we used  <dig> probes in one reaction . nine of  <dig> of the probes targeted to hypersensitive sites showed the expected decrease in peak height for hela cells. the fact that two sensitive sites did not show the expected drop in peak heights is probably due to different growth conditions, differences in passage numbers or to our batch of hela cells being different from the one used in the encode study rather than to limitations of our method. this is supported by the high correlation observed for both technical and biological replicates  and the fact that those two probes showed sensitivity in hek <dig> cells.

we also examined three other cell lines, in order to examine the cell line specificity of our experimental approach. we could show clear differences in hypersensitivity for some loci compared to hela cells. again, the conclusion that these are cell type-specific differences is supported by the concordance of replicate experiments .

to determine suitable dnasei digestion conditions for our method, a range of different dnasei concentrations and incubation conditions were tested. incubating the digestion reactions with the indicated dnasei amounts at room temperature for  <dig> minutes gave more reproducible results than, for example, using less dnasei and incubating at 37°c or incubations on ice . by analysing the digested dna on an agarose gel it was possible to identify the most appropriate conditions. most of our experiments were carried out using nuclei from  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells per dnasei digestion aliquot, providing sufficient dna for several technical replicates. however, in the case of hela cells this number could be reduced to only  <dig> ×  <dig> cells, still providing highly reproducible results as shown by an r <dig> of  <dig>  when comparing the results of the experiments with both cell numbers. furthermore, we found that two different dnasei concentrations and an undigested control are sufficient to analyse hypersensitive sites, which reduces the amount of total starting material required to about  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells.

although we have used  <dig> probes in this study, there is the potential to significantly increase the degree of multiplexing. reducing the interprobe spacing to  <dig> bp would allow up to  <dig> loci to be examined. indeed, by designing probes that can be labelled with different fluorophores  <cit>  it would be possible to analyse >  <dig> loci in a single reaction.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here a rapid and accurate method for assaying dnasei hypersensitive sites. in contrast to genome-wide approaches such as deep sequencing or microarray analysis, we consider the primary strength of this approach to be when <  <dig> genomic loci are being analysed. as all loci are analysed in a single reaction, relatively little starting material is required. we have shown that <  <dig> cells per dnasei treatment can be used, which will allow the study of e.g. embryonic organ development without extensive pooling. the protocol is straightforward and results can be easily obtained from many samples within  <dig> hours. finally, using this method makes it possible to also detect heterozygous and homozygous deletions and duplications of the examined regions, which is an artifact that is known to occur in cultured cells.
