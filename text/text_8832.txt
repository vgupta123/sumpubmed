BACKGROUND
several in vitro studies have shown that zinc  has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against a variety of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus , equine arteritis virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  <cit> . many potential mechanisms have been suggested to explain the potential beneficial effect of zn against virus infections. for example, zn mediates antiviral effects through the inhibition of nidovirus rna-dependent rna polymerases or other proteins essential for the different phases of the viral life cycle  <cit> . in addition, zn participates in initiating and maintaining robust immune responses, in particular cytokine production and modulation of the activity of immune cells  <cit> . zn induces the production of innate interferon -α and also immune ifn-γ, and can potentiate the antiviral action of ifn-α, but not of ifn-γ  <cit> . clearance of viral infections requires cytotoxic t lymphocytes, which are also highly dependent on the presence of zn  <cit> . antibody production during both the first and an immunological memory response is disturbed by zn deficiency  <cit> , indicating that zn is necessary for optimal results following vaccination.

in swine nutrition, especially in the north american swine industry, high levels of zn oxide  are often added to the diet of weaned pigs, since such addition was shown to reduce non-specific post-weaning diarrhea and improve performance in this critical period of dietary change  <cit> . diarrhea is caused by impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function, which most likely leads to malnutrition and decreased uptake of micronutrients, including zn. it was shown that oral zn supplementation with high doses was able to counteract this loss, improve intestinal mucosal integrity as well as absorption of water and electrolytes  <cit> . furthermore, it leads to a faster regeneration of the gut epithelium  <cit> . however, because of environmental concerns, the maximum level of zn allowed in pig diets was set up to  <dig> ppm in the european union, irrespective of the zn formulation  <cit> .

zn homeostasis is maintained in the body through a variety of transporters and zn binding proteins  <cit> . high levels of dietary zn provided as zno have been recently shown to outbalance zn homeostasis with increased accumulation of zn in various organs including the small intestine of piglets  <cit> . since intestinal zn uptake can also take place through passive diffusion, it is likely that very high dietary zn levels would indirectly increase the intestinal barrier function as a protection mechanism of the epithelium. in addition, metallothionein that is induced by zn accumulation in intestinal tissue may also protect the tissue from oxidative damage.

due to suboptimal immune functions, newborn as well as weaned piglets are particularly susceptible to infection by various pathogens, among them tgev, which causes severe to mild gastroenteritis in piglets, depending on the age  <cit> . our previous study  <cit>  showed that high zn levels markedly reduced tgev titers as well as viral rna and protein synthesis in vitro, but there is no report about antiviral effects of zn supplementation in pigs. the aim of this study was to close the knowledge gap and evaluate the antiviral potential and possible protection mechanisms of increased dietary zn supplementation against tgev infection in weaned piglets.

RESULTS
high-dose zn prevents diarrhea in piglets but does not affect other trace elements and virus shedding
tgev infection caused only mild symptoms and there was no difference in dehydration, anorexia, lethargy and body temperature when the different zn treatment groups were compared. however, the body weight in znhigh was higher at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi in comparison to both other groups . furthermore, the fecal score from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi was also higher in znhigh compared to the znlow control group .

serum and liver zn concentrations were higher in the znhigh group as compared to the znmed and znlow groups, but other trace elements were not affected. in addition, there was an increased zn, manganese and iron concentration, but decreased copper concentration, in both liver and serum from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi .

low amounts of shedding tgev could be detected by qpcr from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, irrespective of zn feeding group. the highest incidence was observed at  <dig> dpi with  <dig> out of  <dig> positive tgev shedding piglets in each group.

systemic and mucosal immune responses
figure  <dig> shows the systemic and mucosal immune responses of piglets as measured by elisa. at the time of challenge, all piglets fed with different concentrations of zn were negative for tgev-specific serum igg antibodies. the serum antibody response after infection occurred earlier in znhigh piglets and was measurable already at  <dig> dpi, when all piglets from this group tended to develop higher  tgev-specific serum antibody titers than piglets in the znlow group. at  <dig> dpi, seroconversion was clearly detectable in almost all animals. greater antibody levels were detected in znmed  and znhigh  groups compared to the znlow group at  <dig> dpi .

the levels of siga antibodies in intestinal wash fluids were increased  <dig> to 7-fold from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, showing that mucosal adaptive humoral immune response had also been induced after infection, but the differences between the dietary groups were only marginal .

gene expression profiles
to further elucidate the potential effect of zn supplementation on the immune response and on zn transport, we examined the expression of genes for cytokines and metal binding/transport proteins in intestinal tissues in the three zn treatment groups. there was a statistically significant increase of ifn-α expression in the znlow group compared to znhigh group . 2′, 5′-oligoadenylate synthetase  is one of ifn-stimulated gene products , and there was a decreased expression of this enzyme in the znlow group  . expression of zip <dig> was higher and znt <dig>  znt <dig> and mt <dig> were lower in znhigh group compared with two other groups . expression of il- <dig>  tnf-α and znt <dig> did not differ between treatments.

histology and immunohistochemistry
to further investigate the effect of zn supplementation on tgev infection in piglets, histological changes in intestinal tissues of piglets were examined. piglets from the znlow group showed a destruction of the architecture of intestinal tissue with villous atrophy, which resulted in a significant reduction of the intestinal surface area by a factor of  <dig>   compared to the znmed group where no villus atrophy was observed  . no further changes in villus morphology in the znhigh group  could be detected . in piglets from the znlow group, the majority of jejunal enterocytes was caspase-3-positive while being morphologically altered, whereas in znmed jejunal tissue the number of caspase-3-positive cells were drastically reduced and there was a further reduction of apoptotic cells in znhigh animals . the epithelial architecture of znmed and znhigh jejunum was apparently not impaired. the crypt epithelium was not affected by tgev infection at any zn concentration.

intestinal epithelial resistance, paracellular permeability, and active transport
taking into account the changes in the surface area , repi, corr, as a measure of epithelial integrity, was lower in tissues from the znlow group , compared to znmed  and znhigh  . surprisingly, permeability to the paracellular marker fluorescein did not significantly differ in tgev-challenged jejunal epithelia in any of the animals . as an ex vivo measure for in vivo diarrhea susceptibility, forskolin -induced chloride secretion was quantified as increase in short-circuit current, Δiscfsk,corr. it was found to be increased in jejunal tissue from tgev-infected znlow piglets  compared to znmed  and znhigh  , whereas Δiscfsk, corr of znmed and znhigh did not significantly differ. in contrast, average glucose-induced short-circuit currents  were not different in jejunal tissues from piglets fed the tested zn concentrations, however, against expectations, the range of Δiscglc, corr values was greatly increased in znlow compared to the other two conditions .

discussion
high doses of zno  added to the diets of newly-weaned piglets were shown to improve performance and to reduce the occurrence of unspecific diarrhea  <cit> . tgev infection causes villus atrophy with severe and frequently fatal diarrhea in newborn pigs, while the clinical signs in older piglets or in adult pigs are milder or inapparent because of a higher replacement rate of enterocytes compared to newborn piglet  <cit> . however, asymptomatic older piglets may serve as carriers, and the high mutation rates of coronavirus genomes may lead to the generation of more virulent genotypes. for this study we infected weaned piglets with a cell-culture adapted tgev strain, for which direct antiviral effects of zn were proven in vitro <cit> , and tested if direct antiviral and/or systemic effects of different zn levels could be observed in vivo. critical factors for the reduction in the mortality and morbidity of piglets from tge include a reduction in the infectious agent, and oral rehydration therapy for the treatment of dehydration and metabolic acidosis associated with acute diarrhea  <cit> .

in this study, tgev infection caused only mild clinical symptoms, which can be explained by the piglets’ age and by the use of a tissue-culture adapted virus strain, which was chosen on purpose in order to directly compare results from this study with previous in vitro results  <cit> . furthermore, in our study the piglets were provided with a relatively comfortable environment to minimize stress other than that induced by infection. it should be stressed that our experimental conditions vary substantially from those in commercial farming conditions. this could also contribute to the absence of severe clinical signs after infection. however, this study demonstrated that feeding the znhigh diet improved the fecal score and led to higher body weights after infection in comparison to the znmed and znlow groups. several studies demonstrated that feeding high levels of zn reduces the incidence and severity of diarrhea and improved fecal consistency  <cit> . our results are consistent with these findings showing that the znhigh group had higher fecal scores compared to the znmed and znlow groups after infection. there was also a direct correlation between zn levels and histological changes. tgev infection in the znlow group led to destruction of the enterocytes of jejunal villi as reflected by marked villus atrophy. it has been reported that zn plays a fundamental role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and function. for example, supplementation of zn reduced methotrexate-induced intestinal damage and resulted in faster recovery  <cit> , while it reduced intestinal permeability in bangladeshi children with acute diarrhea and persistent diarrhea syndrome  <cit> . furthermore, feeding supplemental zn to rats with experimental colitis improved mucosal repair by regulating tight junction permeability  <cit> . in agreement with these data, higher repi, corr values in the znmed and znhigh group indicate that zn may prevent epithelial barrier loss induced by tgev. the dramatic increase in ∆iscfsk, corr observed in the znlow group despite the reduced surface area may be interpreted as a protective mechanism. chloride secretion is the basis of secretory diarrhea and might be regarded as a mechanism to rapidly extrude pathogens. the increase in ∆iscglc, corr observed in some of the animals from the znlow group may be a compensatory effect and is in agreement with the observation that, even in the znlow group, animals gained weight at a normal rate. this considerably larger variance in the znlow group indicates that some animals were able to compensate reduced glucose uptake due to the loss of villi by increasing glucose transport capacity.

zn is also important for the production of antibodies against intestinal pathogens  <cit> . in agreement with such finding, tgev-specific serum antibody titers were detected earlier and at higher levels in znhigh when compared to znlow piglets. this finding may be the result of multiple effects of zn on antigen-presenting cells, t-cells and antibody-producing b-lymphocytes. iga is the primary immunoglobulin isotype induced at the mucosal surface. secretory iga  in mucosal secretions provides protection against bacterial and viral pathogens and neutralizes microbial toxins  <cit> . zn can influence siga levels by altering the cytokine profile of stimulated immune cells residing in the gut-associated lymphatic tissue   <cit> . furthermore, siga responses are mediated through activated th <dig> cells producing, among other, abundant amount of il- <dig>  <cit> . in this study, there was an increased siga levels from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi, indicating that adaptive mucosal immune responses were induced by tgev infection but not influenced by the diet. this finding is in accordance with results from broom and colleagues  <cit> , who also showed only slight differences of intestinal iga concentrations between animals either receiving low or high levels of dietary zno. in accordance with these findings, the expression of il- <dig> in the intestinal tissues also showed no difference between the dietary groups at  <dig> dpi. therefore, it is questionable if zn plays a role in enhancing intestinal iga concentration.

tgev infection in piglets is characterized by a robust and early ifn-α production in intestinal secretions and in other organs  <cit> . at  <dig> dpi, higher ifn-α gene expression levels in the znlow group may be consistent with a more severe tgev infection or higher virus loads in this group compared to the znhigh group. the activation of oas, one of the ifn-stimulated gene products , can lead to apoptosis  <cit> , potentially by indirectly triggering cleavage of caspase- <dig>  <cit> . the increased oas level in the znlow group may reflect tgev-induced apoptosis in intestinal epithelial, as it was shown, that the amount of caspase-3-positive cells was markedly increased in the znlow compared with the znmed and znhigh group. this finding is in agreement with the histological observations: the high-grade villus atrophy in the znlow and normal jejunal mucosal morphology in the znhigh group.

metallothionein is known to be induced by exposure to heavy metal cations  <cit> , and in line with a former study  <cit> , the expression level of mt <dig> was higher with concomitant high levels of zn in piglets . as reported previously, this indicates an outbalanced zn homeostasis although the expression of zn transporters in the jejunum was regulated to reduce zn uptake  from the gut lumen and increase the export of zn from epithelial cells  in the znhigh group. however, an increased level of zn in intestinal tissue and the induction of metallothionein may explain our observations of improved intestinal mucosal integrity and histological changes, which are in line with other studies  <cit> . thus, changes in absorption of water and electrolytes may counteract tgev infection, which causes impaired intestinal epithelial barrier function and decreased uptake of micronutrients.

the paracellular epithelial barrier is highly regulated both under normal conditions and in disease. during infection, tnf-α is a mediator between the immune system and the intestinal epithelial barrier by altering tight junction proteins and their cellular localization. more specifically, the cytokine up-regulates the pore-forming protein claudin- <dig>  <cit>  and redistributes the tightening protein claudin- <dig>  <cit> . this leads to an impaired barrier function which is associated with increased paracellular permeability. however, our in vitro work  <cit>  and the in vivo study presented here did not find any up- or down-regulation of tnf-α after tgev infection in any of the experimental groups. the outcome is, however, in accordance with the data set of permeability to fluorescein , as paracellular permeability was not affected. the data could, therefore, be interpreted as a result of a different pathological mechanism, possibly mediated by ifn-α, rather than by tnf-α, as up-regulation of the former in znlow piglets was clearly evident.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides data that supplementation of the post-weaning diet with high levels of zno resulted in earlier and higher tgev-specific antibody response, modulation of cytokine expression, and prevention of disruption of the intestinal barrier integrity. our findings might also be interesting for infections with other coronaviruses like sars-cov, which could cause gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhea as well.
