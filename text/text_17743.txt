BACKGROUND
the atm protein kinase is a key component of the signal transduction pathway that is activated in response to dna damage, particularly if the damage involves formation of dna dsbs  <cit> . atm activation takes place through an autophosphorylation site on ser <dig>  which leads to dissociation of the inactive atm dimer  into single protein molecules with kinase activity  <cit> . while ser <dig> phosphorylation is responsible for dimer dissociation, the catalytic domain of atm, which becomes accessible to substrates only when atm is a monomer, is located outside of the ser <dig> locus  <cit> . atm activation is mediated through mobilization of the mre11-rad50-nbs <dig>  complex, which recognizes dna damage, recruits atm and also functions in targeting atm to initiate phosphorylation of the respective substrates  <cit> . the initial activation of atm occurs at some distance from the site of dsb and is initiated by the changes in higher order chromatin structure resulting from relaxation of the topological stress of the dna double helix following induction of the dsb  <cit> . it should be noted, however, that the mechanism of atm activation is more complex than just via autophosphorylation. recent evidence suggests activation requires prior atm acetylation, which is mediated by the tip <dig> histone acetyltransferase  <cit> , and is associated with protein phosphatase  <dig> activity  <cit> , as well as interactions with other factors  <cit> .

several downstream target substrates phosphorylated by atm, such as p <dig> , chk <dig>  chk <dig>  brca <dig> and h2ax, are recognized as having tumor suppressor functions  <cit> , since their phosphorylation is essential for successful dna repair, suppression of cell progression through the cell cycle and/or induction of apoptosis. disruption in one or more of these mechanisms can promote expansion of dna damage to cell progeny and instigate genomic instability. development of the phospho-specific antibody towards ser <dig> phosphorylated atm  provided a convenient tool to detect atm activation immunocytochemically in tissue sections  <cit>  and to measure expression of atm-s1981p in individual cells by cytometry  <cit> . it is noted that when activation of atm is induced by dsbs, the activated atm is localized in individual discrete foci  <cit> . however when other dna lesions or chromatin alterations trigger atm activation, the activated atm is diffusely scattered throughout the nucleoplasm and does not form distinct foci  <cit> .

one substrate phosphorylated by atm is a variant of histone h2a, histone h2ax  <cit> . its phosphorylation on ser <dig> occurs in response to induction of dsbs. expression of phosphorylated h2ax  is, therefore, considered to be a marker of induction of dsbs  <cit> . as with atm-s1981p, the development of a phospho-specific γh2ax antibody made it possible to study h2ax phosphorylation in individual cells  <cit> , and to quantify by cytometry γh2ax expression in response to dna damage by different agents  <cit> .

h2ax can be phosphorylated not only by atm but also by other phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinases  such as atm- and rad3-related , or dna dependent protein kinase   <cit> . for example, h2ax phosphorylation in response to replication stress induced by hydroxyurea, excess thymidine or aphidicolin was shown to be mediated by atr  <cit>  rather than by atm  <cit> . in contrast, dna-pkcs was shown to mediate h2ax phosphorylation in hypertonically-stressed cells  <cit> , as well as in response to dna fragmentation during apoptosis  <cit> . dna fragmentation in apoptotic cells was also seen to be accompanied by activation of atm, which would suggest that atm may mediate h2ax phosphorylation during apoptosis as well  <cit> . in addition, there is also evidence that in response to dna damage caused by ionizing radiation, all three pikks  may function redundantly to phosphorylate h2ax  <cit> . presumably, each pikk responds to a hierarchy of specific types of dna damage or cell contexts in which it may alternately play a primary or supporting role, or no role at all, in the phosphorylation of h2ax. to date, most published data implicate atm as the dominant physiologically mediator of h2ax phosphorylation in response to dsb formation  <cit> .

we have recently reported that brief exposure of human normal bronchial epithelial cells and human pulmonary adenocarcinoma a <dig> cells to cs or to cigarette smoke condensates induced h2ax phosphorylation  <cit> . in a subsequent study we observed that the reactive oxygen species  scavenger n-acetyl-l-cysteine  was, to a large extent, able to protect the cells from induction of h2ax phosphorylation by cs  <cit> . the data suggested that cs-induced dna damage in these cells involves formation of dsbs, and that these lesions were mediated, in part, by ros. the present study was aimed to reveal whether atm is activated by exposure of cells to cs. if atm activation preceded or was concurrent with h2ax phosphorylation, and if it correlated in intensity with h2ax phosphorylation, it would strongly suggest that atm is the pikk that phosphorylates h2ax in response to cell exposure to cs. it would also provide clues as to which potential downstream cell cycle checkpoints, whose activation is mediated by atm  <cit> , may be impacted by cs.

RESULTS
exposure of a <dig> cells to cs led to a marked rise in expression of atm-s1981p and γh2ax . the bivariate analysis of cellular dna content and intensity of immunofluorescence made it possible to correlate expression of atm-s1981p or γh2ax with cell position in the cell cycle. expression of atm-s1981p and γh2ax was markedly increased in cells exposed to cs compared to the mock treated cells. in fact, nearly all cells from the cs-treated cultures expressed atm-s1981p or γh2ax if above the level representing the upper threshold of expression of these phospho-antibodies for 97% of the cells from the mock-treated cultures. it is also apparent from the raw data shown in the scattergrams , that exposure to cs led to induction of atm-s1981p or γh2ax expression at a comparable level in all phases of the cell cycle.

fig.  <dig> presents the quantitative data illustrating the cs-dose dependence of the induction of atm-s1981p and γh2ax in a <dig> cells in relation to cell position in the cell cycle. as is evident, the time-dependent increases in atm-s1981p and γh2ax if were essentially the same for all cells, regardless of the cell cycle phase. while the maximal  rise in atm-s1981p expression was achieved after  <dig> min exposure to cs, induction of γh2ax continued to increase during the  <dig> min exposure. the mid-slope increase in induction of atm-s1981p and γh2ax was at  <dig> and  <dig> min of exposure to cs, respectively. caspase- <dig> activation was monitored on parallel slides to rule out any possible effects of apoptosis on induction of either γh2ax or atm-s1981p if. no apoptosis was observed under the experimental conditions used in this study .

the immunocytochemical/cytometric data demonstrating induction of atm-s1981p as a function of dose of cs  were confirmed by western blotting . the data show that  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min exposure to cs led to an increase in intensity of the atm-s1981p bands compared to the respective bands from the mock-treated cells. the bands detected by the atm antibody that were not phospho-specific do not show changes in intensity between cs treated and untreated cells.

in order to determine if there was a direct quantitative relationship between γh2ax if induction and atm-s1981p activation, cells were exposed to cs from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations . fig.  <dig> shows in fact that there is a good correlation  between these two variables suggesting that the expression levels of γh2ax and atm are directly linked.

it was of interest to compare standard reference cigarettes to a commercial brand in terms of the level of expression of atm-s1981p and γh2ax. we therefore examined two industry standard reference cigarettes, im <dig>  and 2r4f , and a leading commercially available u.s. cigarette brand, designated here as brand a . when cells were exposed for  <dig> min to cs from either im <dig>  2r4f, or brand a commercial cigarettes, there was little difference in the degree of γh2ax if or atm-s1981p expression .

caffeine and nu <dig> are putative inhibitors of atm  <cit>  and dna-pkcs  <cit> , respectively. either of these kinases can potentially cause the phosphorylation of h2ax following dna damage. to explore their potential inhibitory effect  <dig> mm caffeine or  <dig> μm nu <dig> was added to the medium  <dig> h prior to exposure to cs, was present in d-pbs during exposure to cs from im <dig> cigarettes and, further in the medium during the  <dig> h post-exposure incubation.

as can be seen in figure  <dig>  cs from im <dig> induced a considerable level of γh2ax if in a <dig> cells. the values in the figure represent the difference between the cs-treated sample and the mock-treated control . inclusion of the vehicle dmso had no appreciable effect on the level of γh2ax if generated by cs from im <dig>  caffeine, at a concentration of  <dig> mm, reduced the average level of γh2ax if by approximately 37%. in parallel cultures on the same slide, atm-s1981p if was reduced by 45% in the presence of caffeine. nu <dig> had little or no inhibitory effect on γh2ax if  while atm-s1981p if was actually increased slightly . no cell cycle phase specificity associated with the caffeine-induced decrease in either atm-s1981p or γh2ax if was apparent.

figs.  <dig> and  <dig> reveal the effect of cs on expression of atm-s1981p and γh2ax detected immunocytochemically in individual a <dig> cells and observed by fluorescence microscopy. in the mock-treated sample only the mitotic cell shows strong atm-s1981p if which is localized throughout the whole cell . some interphase cells show the presence of atm-s1981p in single point-like structures, which were previously identified as centrosomes  <cit> . utilizing expression of atm-s1981p in the mitotic cell to determine the duration of exposure for the photograph, the background, constitutive expression of atm-s1981p in the interphase cells of the untreated sample is barely visible. in the cells exposed to cs, there is strong and rather uniform if revealing the presence of activated atm throughout the nucleus .

the presence of γh2ax in the mock treated cells appears in the form of distinct foci that are randomly distributed through the nuclei . the number of such foci and their proximity are greatly increased in the cells exposed to cs, which leads to much stronger overall intensity of γh2ax if .

discussion
cs is a complex chemical mixture of gases and suspended particulate matter that contains a wide range of carcinogens, mutagens, and free radicals that can induce an array of dna lesions  that have been strongly implicated in the development and progression of human cancers by epidemiological studies  <cit> . our previous studies showed that cs and cigarette smoke condensate  can also directly induce dsbs in both normal and malignant lung cells  <cit> . dsbs are a major type of dna damage that can lead to translocations and chromosomal instability, two important mechanisms in the generation of malignant tumors  <cit> . consequently, detection of dsbs and the various proteins that sense and orchestrate repair of these lesions may ultimately provide a more precise measurement of the potential cancer risk in individuals exposed to cs.

in the current study, we show that exposure of a <dig> cells to cs led to concurrent activation of atm and phosphorylation of h2ax. moreover, there was a close relationship between atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation both in timing  and in the degree of response to cs. thus, both events were triggered after  <dig> min exposure to cs , and the degree of response, when cells were treated with cs from cigarettes with different tobacco and filter combinations, was strongly correlated . in addition, both atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation were partially suppressed by caffeine but not by nu <dig>  implying that cs-induced h2ax phosphorylation was predominantly mediated by atm. dna damage that primarily results in formation of dsbs is believed to trigger h2ax phosphorylation mediated by atm rather than by atr or dna-pkcs  <cit> . this observation is in contrast to other genotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and uvr that induce h2ax phosphorylation as a function of replication stress, but which is mediated by atr and not by atm  <cit> . however, despite the apparent causal relationship between atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation in cs-treated a <dig> cells, a definitive study in which atm expression is suppressed by interfering rnas  is currently being conducted in order to prove conclusively that atm is the primary responsive kinase.

how might cs induce dsbs? the most common mechanism by which dsbs are thought to be generated is as a result of stalled dna replication forks at the sites of single strand dna lesions such as single-strand breaks  during dna replication  <cit> . unrepaired dsbs generated by such mechanisms may result in chromosome breakage and mironucleation leading to genetic instability and malignant transformation  <cit> . however, although it is clear that cs can cause numerous ssbs that may induce replication fork stalling  <cit> , some data suggest that even large amounts of ssbs are incapable of provoking atm activation  <cit> . whether this is a general phenomenon or restricted to a specific cell type or cell context remains to be determined, but it may suggest that the induction of dsbs by cs occurs via a mechanism other than ssb formation. an important observation in this regard is that if stalled replication forks at ssb lesions were the dominant mechanism of dsb formation, it would be expected to reflect a characteristic pattern of h2ax phosphorylation that is distinctly maximal in s-phase cells  <cit> . while we observed somewhat higher levels of h2ax phosphorylation in s-phase cells compared to g <dig> cells upon exposure to cs , the difference was rather small. these data imply that the contribution of this mechanism to the overall level of dsb damage, as reflected by the increased expression of γh2ax, was not predominant. one conjecture to mechanistically explain this observation is the possible activation of smc <dig>  a critical downstream event in the atm-nbs1-brca <dig> pathway that engages the s-phase checkpoint and prevents movement of the replication forks and thus their collisions with ssdna lesions  <cit> . however, whether smc <dig> is activated in cs-exposed cells remains to be determined.

cs also contains a range of carcinogens known to result in covalently linked dna adducts either directly or indirectly after metabolic activation  <cit> . upon cell proliferation, these type of adducts can induce dna replication errors that may result in carcinogenic events  <cit> . moreover, as these dna-carcinogen adducts are removed by base excision repair mechanisms, defects in one or more of the genes involved in these processes can directly result in dsbs  <cit> . another potentially unique capability of cs may be that it can induce dsbs directly due to its large concentration of highly reactive organic and inorganic substances that either are free radicals or can generate free radicals within the cell that can subsequently attack dna  <cit> . it has been speculated that multiple hydroxyl radicals produced in close proximity could directly cause dsbs and lead to atm activation  <cit> . it is well documented that increased oxidative stress is a major mechanism by which cs causes airway damage that can lead to a host of pathogenic conditions including lung cancer  <cit> , possible as a result of the induction of oxidatively derived dna damage such as altered or mismatched bases, deletions and insertions, intra and inter-strand cross-links, or possibly dsbs. additional research will be required to determine the primary mechanism by which dsbs are formed in cells exposed to cs. regardless of the mechanism by which cs induces dsbs, repair of this defect occurs through two major pathways, homologous recombination  and non-homologous end-joining . in vertebrate cells, nhej is the dominant dsb repair mechanism, particularly in g1-phase cells  <cit> . however, reliance on nhej for accurate repair of cs-induced dsbs may be problematic for the damaged cell since this process is error-prone, often resulting in deletion of base pairs that can lead to the accumulation of defective dna with each cell cycle following exposure to cs  <cit> .

assessing the sites of atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation by uv fluorescence microscopy revealed different patterns of localization in cs-exposed cells. the sites of γh2ax localization had a distinct punctate pattern . this was evident despite the close proximity of individual foci with each other and the frequent overlap of their images. the presence of distinct foci of γh2ax if is considered to be a reliable marker of dsbs  <cit> . in contrast to γh2ax, no distinct atm-s1981p if foci were observed, and activated atm was spread rather uniformly over the whole nucleoplasm . atm activation in response to dsb formation, similar as h2ax phosphorylation, is purported to present as distinct atm-s1981p if foci  <cit> . it is likely, therefore, that the observed pattern of atm-s1981p if in a <dig> cells reflects, not only atm activation in response to formation of dsbs, but also to other types of cs-induced dna lesions that may have more global effects such as altering chromatin structure  <cit> . such diverse spatial patterns of response in terms of nuclear atm activation and h2ax phosphorylation are consistent with a variety of different dna lesions generated by cs  <cit> . it has been proposed by kitagawa et al.  <cit>  that atm phosphorylation may be triggered by "structural" changes in chromatin as a result of formation of dsbs or other types of dna damage that leads to altered topological stress on the dna double helix in the proximity of the damage. in support of this mechanism are the observations that chromatin condensation during mitosis  <cit>  or premature chromosomes condensation  <cit>  is accompanied by atm activation. the altered topological stress on dna in mitosis is reflected by dna's increased propensity to undergo denaturation  <cit>  and its sensitivity to single-strand specific endonucleases such as s <dig> or mung bean nuclease  <cit> . the observed cs-induced h2ax phosphorylation may also be mediated by the mechanism associated with ner and linked with the excision of dna adducts generated by cs. this mechanism would be consistent with the recent findings of marti et al  <cit>  who reported h2ax phosphorylation in g <dig> cells upon exposure to uv-c light, which was abrogated in the ner mutant cells.

CONCLUSIONS
atm is a key element in the signal transduction pathways that detect dna damage and orchestrate a multi-layered cellular response that includes recruiting dna repair machinery, engaging cell cycle checkpoints, and increasing susceptibility to pro-apoptotic signals should dna repair prove unsuccessful  <cit> . its activation by cs provides evidence of extensive changes in the signal transmission pathways that are essential for cell survival and for protecting cells from neoplastic transformation. it would be expected, therefore, that genetic changes in terms of mutations in any of the individual components of atm-associated pathways may constitute a significant risk factor in current or former smokers in terms of cancer development.
