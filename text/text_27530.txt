BACKGROUND
glioblastoma  is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor in humans, involving glial cells and accounting for 52% of all parenchymal brain tumor cases and 20% of all intracranial tumors  <cit> . glioblastoma is located preferentially in the cerebral hemispheres. in the past two decades, the molecular mechanisms, genetics and pathways to treat gbm have extensively been studied  <cit> . however, the precise mechanism of gbm is unknown and its median survival rate is very low  <cit> . the cancer genome atlas  generated large-scale multi-dimensional datasets to catalogue cancer alterations  <cit> . gbm is the first cancer studied by tcga. in the gbm pilot project, a total of  <dig> genes were sequenced for detection of somatic mutations in  <dig> tumor and matched normal tissues pairs; expressions of  <dig>  genes were measured in  <dig> tumor tissue samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples and  <dig> cell line; and expressions of  <dig> micrornas  were profiled in  <dig> tumor tissue samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples. the generated multi-dimensional genetic and molecular data will provide rich information which allows us to uncover mechanisms of gbm.

in the past, although enormous efforts toward generating high-throughput genetic and molecular data have been made, knowing how to integrate genetic and molecular data and unravel underlying mechanisms of cancer remains unresolved. to gain significant insights into the mechanisms of cancer, it is indispensable to reconstruct and dissect various pathways, and genetic and molecular networks that define the molecular states of systems involved in tumorigenesis. to meet this challenge, we will reconstruct genetic and molecular networks involved in tumorigenesis and study how these networks respond to the perturbation of somatic mutations and environments. genes with dna variation, mrna and mirna form the complex genetic and molecular networks that determine the cell's function and response to the perturbation of external stimuli. these networks consist of three levels. the subnetwork in the first level consists of  significantly associated somatic mutations and  loh which were identified by a group association test statistic. the subnetworks in the third level are mrna and mirna coexpression networks. the subnetworks in the second level are to connect the subnetworks in the first level and subnetworks in the third level. the network pipeline analysis approach is shown in figure  <dig> 

it is increasingly recognized that mirnas have emerged as an important component in the regulation of gene expression, with imperfect base pairing, to target sites in the 3' utr of the messenger rnas  <cit> . three types of methods, sequence analysis, mirna-mrna regression analysis, and machine learning, have been used to identify potential target genes  <cit> . to improve the accuracy of target prediction, we will combine sequence analysis with regression analysis for target prediction, which finally leads to the formation of mirna target networks. mirna target networks connect gene coexpression and mirna coexpression networks. expression quantitative trait loci  are genomic loci that regulate gene transcription. eqtls may act in cis  or trans  to a gene or a precursor mirna  <cit> . we applied a group regression method which regresses the expression of a mrna or a mirna on the number of all mutated alleles across the region of interest to identify eqtl. the identified eqtls connected the subnetworks in the first and third levels.

biological functions and mechanisms are encoded in network properties. an important strategy for unraveling the mechanisms of initiation and progression of cancer is to conduct analysis of complex genetic and molecular networks and study their behaviors under genetic and environment perturbations. robustness of a biological network, ability to retain much of its functionality in the face of perturbation  <cit> , has emerged as a fundamental concept in the study of network topological properties  <cit> . the locations of the dna variants, mrna and mirna in the genetic and molecular networks are likely to affect the phenotypes. we use network structural analysis as a tool to identify a set of key cancer causing genome alternations and core modules of biological networks that play an essential role in the development of cancer.

the purpose of this report is to use systems biology and network approaches to develop novel analytical strategies to unravel the mechanism of gbm by systematically integrating the multi-dimensional datasets from the tcga project.

RESULTS
test association of somatic mutations and loh mutations with glioblastoma
traditional statistical methods for genetic studies of complex diseases are mainly based on the common disease/common variant hypothesis. however, it has been reported that common variants account for only a small proportion of the genetic contribution to complex diseases. recent deep-resequencing reveals that in the genome there are a large number of rare variants  which also play an important role in causing various complex diseases including cancer  <cit> . multiple rare mutations, each with a minor marginal genetic effect, but collectively may make large contributions in the population. most statistics for testing the association of common alleles with common diseases have mainly focused on the investigation of variants individually. however, due to their rarity, the frequencies of rare alleles may be comparable with genotyping errors. as a consequence, individual tests of association of rare variants with disease, as is often done by the traditional association tests, have limited power and may not be robust  <cit> . an alternative approach to the current variant-by-variant tests is group association tests in which a group of rare genetic variants are jointly tested  <cit> . it has been shown that the number of rare alleles in large samples is approximately distributed as a poisson process with its intensity depending on the total mutation rate  <cit> . the intensity of the poisson process within a segment of the genome can be interpreted as the mutation rate. similar to the standard χ <dig> test for association of snps which compares the difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls, we propose a new group test statistic ta that is to compare differences in the mutation rates between tumor and normal samples . the statistic ta was applied to gbm in the tcga dataset. the tumor tissues of  <dig> gbm patients and  <dig> matched normal tissues were sequenced. a somatic mutation was recorded when the mutation was detected only in the tumor tissue. there are  <dig> genes in which at least one somatic mutation was detected. a loh mutation was recorded when the genotype in blood or normal tissue is heterozygous, and in the tumor tissue, the reference allele loses normal function and the genotype becomes homozygous. there are  <dig> genes in which at least one loh mutation was detected. we identified association of somatic mutations in  <dig> genes by the statistics ta , and association of loh in  <dig> genes by the statistic tg with gbm with a false discovery rate  of less than  <dig>  . genes tp <dig>  pten, egfr, nf <dig>  rb <dig> and erbb <dig> were reported to be associated with gbm in the previous tcga data analysis  <cit> . the remaining  <dig> somatic mutated genes and  <dig> loh mutated genes were newly identified by the statistics tg or ta. ncbi entrez gene database  <cit>  reported that: chek <dig> is a cell cycle checkpoint regulator and putative tumor suppressor, and associated with gbm; gstm <dig> was reported to be involved in cancer, bcl11a is a proto-oncogene, and fn <dig> is involved in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. gene prame was reported to be associated with melanoma and acute leukemias. association of the other  <dig> genes such as nrap, mk <dig>  c10orf <dig> and c9orf <dig> with gbm was first reported here.

network analysis of gene expressions
comparative studies of gene expression between normal and tumor tissues is one of the most widely used strategies for unraveling the molecular circuitry underlying cancer  <cit> . to uncover the mechanisms of glioblastoma, expressions of  <dig>  genes were measured in  <dig> tumor tissue samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples and  <dig> cell line using the affymetrix ht human genome u <dig> array plate set. a total of  <dig>  genes were differentially expressed between tumor and normal tissues by the wilcoxon rank-sum test . of the  <dig>  genes,  <dig> genes were cancer genes or cancer candidate genes ;  <dig> of them were oncogene including cdk <dig> and raf4; and  <dig> of them were tumor suppressor genes including tp <dig> and rb <dig>  twenty-five of which were gbm related genes including tcf <dig>  tp <dig>  col4a <dig>  col3a <dig> and col5a <dig>  we also observed that of the  <dig>  genes,  <dig> genes were in signal transduction pathways,  <dig> genes were down regulated and  <dig> genes were up regulated .

to investigate the functions of the genes at the system-level and uncover the mechanism of gbm, we used lasso algorithms for a gaussian graphical model to infer gene coexpression networks . the largest connected coexpression network with the average shortest path  <dig>  and diameter  <dig> had  <dig>  genes and  <dig>  edges . coexpression networks are usually organized into modules that perform specific biological processes and tasks. a dynamic tree cut procedure was used to identify modules and a fisher's exact test was used to discover pathways that were overrepresented in the module . a total of  <dig> modules were significantly enriched for at least one pathway , indicating that a coexpression network was organized into functional units. enriched pathways in the modules were involved in neurodegenerative diseases, development processes, cancer related signaling pathways and metabolism. a parkinson's disease pathway was enriched in module  <dig> with olive green color. genes uqcrc <dig>  atp <dig> h, cox7c, ndufa <dig>  cox5r and cox4i <dig> in module  <dig> are involved in mitochondria dysfunction http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa <dig> html. a cell cycle pathway was enriched in module  <dig> with yellow color. we can see that coexpressed genes chek <dig>  ccnb <dig>  ccna <dig>  ccne <dig>  mad2l <dig> and bub <dig> in module  <dig> are directly or indirectly connected in the cell cycle pathway http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?hsa <dig> 

the architecture of a coexpression network is important for uncovering the genes which are involved in cancer. to identify the most important genes in the coexpression network, we used the damage value of a node as a measure to rank the importance of a node. the damage value of a node which is defined as the difference in the number of nodes of the largest connected network before and after removal of that particular node can be used to measure the effect of the removal of the node, i.e. the ability of a network to avoid malfunctioning when a gene is removed   <cit> . we ranked all differentially expressed genes in the largest coexpression subnetwork according to their damage values. the top 5% of the genes in the ranked list with damage values greater than  <dig> were summarized in additional files  <dig>  these genes were essential to the function of coexpression networks. we suspect that these genes may be involved in the development of gbm.

there were three differentially expressed genes  whose damage values ranked among the top in cancer and cancer candidate genes . their removal from the network may disconnect some components in the network and hence compromise the functions of the genes in coexpression networks. tp <dig> and col3a <dig> are gbm related genes and rap1gds <dig> is a cancer candidate gene. the p <dig> pathway is central to oncogenesis  <cit> . tp <dig> was up regulated in gbm tissue samples and was highly over expressed in the cerebrum tissue samples. interestingly it was observed that tp <dig> had a damage value of  <dig>  but was only connected with two up regulated genes . tgif <dig> was differentially expressed  and had a damage value of  <dig>  tgif <dig> plays an oncogenic role through inhibition of tgfb  <cit> . eif4a <dig> was over expressed in tumor tissue  and had a damage value of  <dig>  using programmed cell death  <dig>  eif4a <dig> inhibits translation initiation and acts as a tumor suppressor by forming a complex  <cit> . col3a <dig> was over expressed in gbm tissue samples  and had damage value  <dig>  it was also reported to be over expressed in ovarian cancer and breast cancer  <cit> . col3a <dig> encodes a fibrillar collagen which is a major component of the extracellular matrix protein surrounding cancer cells. the presence of ecm protein prevents apoptosis of cancer cells. col3a <dig> plays an important role in apoptosis, proliferation regulation and anticancer drug resistance  <cit> . rap1gds <dig> was under expressed in gbm tissue samples  and had a damage value of  <dig> in the coexpression network. rap1gds <dig> is a transcription factor  <cit> . it was reported that translocation fusion of the nup <dig> and rap1gds <dig> genes was recurrent in t-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia  <cit> .

other genes at the top of the list including t1a <dig>  kiaa <dig> and cacybp also have remarkable biological implications. t1a1t had the largest damage value , was over expressed in the gbm tissue samples, and played a role in apoptosis  <cit> . kiaa <dig> was reported to be associated with the nervous system  <cit>  and cacybp was reported to participate in p53-induced beta-catenin degradation. cacybp can suppress proliferation and tumorigenesis of renal cancer cells  <cit> . cacybp is also reported to be under expressed in gastric cancer  <cit>  and renal cancer  <cit> .

using david bioinformatics resources online  <cit> , we performed the gene set enrichment analysis and found the most enriched gene ontology  and pathway groups. go:0045202~synapse , go:0007268~synaptic transmission  and go:0005509~calcium ion binding  were among the most significant go terms, with p-values  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection , long-term potentiation  and calcium signaling pathway , were the most significantly enriched pathways with p-values  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. the results suggested that the differentially expressed genes were most involved in the signal and nervous system related pathways.

network analysis of mirna expressions
mirnas are short endogenous non-coding rnas of  <dig> nucleotides in length that negatively regulate gene expression through base pairing with target mrnas  <cit> . deregulation of mirna and mirna-related genetic alternations are involved in causing cancers  <cit> . to unravel the pattern of differential regulation of mirna, expressions of  <dig> mirnas including  <dig> human mirnas were profiled in  <dig> tumor tissue samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples by agilent  <dig> ×  <dig> k human mirna-specific microarrays. a total of  <dig> mirna were differentially expressed between the gbm tissue and normal tissues samples which were identified by wilcoxon rank-sum test . of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirna,  <dig> mirnas were up regulated and  <dig> down regulated . among them,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were reported to be associated with the gbm, other cancers and other diseases, respectively, in the literatures  <cit> .

similar to genes, mirna are not isolated, instead they act together to perform biological functions  <cit> . to understand how mirna regulate biological processes at a system level, we used lasso algorithms for a gaussian graphical model to map the simultaneous expression of mirna into a coexpression network in which nodes represent mirna and edges represent conditional dependence between two connected mirnas, given all other mirna expressions in the network . the largest connected mirna coexpression network with the average shortest path  and diameter  had  <dig> mirnas and  <dig> edges . one main feature of this mirna coexpression network is that mir-770-5p and mir- <dig> divided the whole network into three subnetworks, the left, middle, and right subnetwork. the middle subnetwork was densely connected.

similar to the gene coexpression network, we use the damage value of a node as a robustness measure to rank the importance of a mirna in the mirna coexpression network. we ranked all differentially expressed mirna in the largest connected mirna coexpression network according to their damage values. the top  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with the largest damage values  which are referred to as fragile mirnas) were listed in additional files  <dig>  of the  <dig> fragile mirnas,  <dig> mirnas  were in the left coexpression subnetwork and  <dig> under expressed mirnas were in the right subnetwork. the middle subnetwork contains no fragile mirnas. figure  <dig> shows that mirnas in the middle subnetwork were densely connected. the middle network with large numbers of redundant mirnas was highly robust in response to perturbation of external forces. mir-487a, mir-487b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were the most important components in the mirna coexpression network. removal of one of them would cause disconnection between the left part and right part of the mirna coexpression network and hence lead to dysfunction of the whole mirna coexpression network. we observed that mir-487a and mi-487b were down regulated, and mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were up regulated in the gbm tissues. snps within the mir- <dig> seed binding region in the 3'-utr of the set <dig> gene which methylates tp <dig> is reported to be associated with early age of onset of breast cancer  <cit> . their major functions are to regulate cell cycle, dna replication, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage and signal transduction . it is interesting to note that three of the  <dig> fragile mirnas were significantly related to gbm survival time . the three fragil mirnas include hsa-mir-487b with p-value:  <dig>  and hazard ratio:  <dig> ; hsa-mir-17-5p with p-value:  <dig>  and hazard ratio:  <dig> ; and hsa-mir-106a with p-value:  <dig> , hazard ratio:  <dig> . therefore, we predict that these mirnas are cancer related and play an important role in tumorigenesis and survival.

mirna target networks
mirnas down regulate gene expressions by base-pairing with the 3'-noncoding region of the target mrnas. it is estimated that up to 30% of the genes might be regulated by mirnas  <cit> . it is hypothesized that mirnas and their targets form complex networks to perform various biological functions. to reveal mechanisms of the gbm, we identified target genes of the mirnas and constructed mirna target networks. procedures for discovering the target genes consisted of two steps. the first step was to conduct sequence analysis that used sequence complementarities of mirna and its target site to predict potential mirna target genes. since mirnas repress the expression of its target gene, the second step is to test the inverse relationship between the expression profile of the mirna and that of its potential target gene.

to achieve this, we regressed the expression of target mrna on the expression of mirnas and selected mrna with significant negative regression coefficients as mirna targets. the p-value for declaring significant evidence of the mirna target was  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  we also searched the predicted potential mirna targets in the mirgen  <cit> , which integrated animal mirna targets according to combinations of four widely used target prediction programs , and experimentally supported targets from tarbase  <cit>  and mir2disease  <cit> .

the above methods were applied to mirna and mrna expression dataset in  <dig> tumor tissue samples and  <dig> normal tissue samples with  <dig>  differentially expressed mrnas and  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas. this resulted in extremely complex mirna target networks. we found  <dig>  matched mirna-mrna pairs for  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas and  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. of the  <dig>  target pairs,  <dig> down regulated mirna targets  <dig> over expressed genes while  <dig> up regulated mirnas target  <dig> under expressed genes .

among them, a total of  <dig> previously verified targets of  <dig> mirnas by experiments elsewhere were listed in table  <dig>  of  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> under expressed mirnas  function as a tumor-suppressor and  <dig> over expressed mirnas  function as an oncogene . ctdsp <dig> has been reported to be a validated target gene of mir-124a  <cit> , rtn <dig> and slc25a <dig> were validated targets of mir- <dig>  <cit> . mir- <dig> was found to be over expressed in multiple cancers down regulated tumor suppressor genes  in invasion and metastasis of cancer  <cit> . basp <dig> is a transcriptional co-suppressor for the wilms tumor suppressor protein wt <dig>  thus it can regulate wt <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . nogo-a, one protein isoforms encoded by rtn <dig>  turned out to be a neuronal protein involved in diverse processes that goes from axonal fasciculation to apoptosis  <cit> . mir- <dig> targeted a regulator of the apoptosis gene ldoc <dig>  <cit> . up-regulation of mir- <dig> directly targeted gene efna <dig>  which is crucial for endothelial cell response to hypoxia, affecting cell survival, migration, and differentiation  <cit> . mir-29c was reported to be under expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas and up regulated genes col4a <dig>  col4a <dig> and tdg  <cit> . col4a <dig> and col4a <dig> were genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins, as previously discussed; they play an important role in apoptosis, proliferation regulation and anticancer drug resistance  <cit> . col4a <dig> was validated to be also targets of mir-29b in another research group  <cit> . tdg was involved in dna repair, a process frequently dysregulated in many cancers  <cit> . in mouse and human cells, mir- <dig> inhibits the expression of abca <dig>  thereby attenuating cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein a <dig>  <cit> . it was also reported that the role of mir- <dig> controlling the hematopoietic stem cells self-renewal through p <dig> may lead to the prevention and treatment of hematopoietic disorders  <cit> .

the resulting mirna target networks have several remarkable features. first, many important genes in the mrna coexpression networks were targets of differentially expressed mirnas. through our prediction, we found that the top  <dig> genes with damage values greater than  <dig> in the gene coexpression network were negatively regulated by  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas . all  <dig> genes and many mirnas were crucial components in the gene and mirna coexpression networks. their altered expressions played an important role in tumorigenesis. among them, over expressed rbbp <dig>  with the largest damage value  in the table was negatively regulated by under expressed mir-29b  and mir-29c . under expressed trim <dig>  with a damage value of  <dig> was negatively regulated by over expressed mir- <dig> . over expressed tp <dig>  with a damage value of  <dig> was negatively regulated by underexpressed mir-485-5p. rbbp <dig> has been implicated in chromatin remodeling and regulation of cell proliferation. it has been reported that rbbp <dig> is overexpressed in different human tumors, such as lung, liver and thyroid cancer, acute myelocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> . trim <dig> is thought to be a new tumor suppressor gene  <cit> .

second, many genes targeted by critical components in the mirna coexpression network, played important roles in the regulation of neural process and tumor genesis. to study the function of the top  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas with the largest damage values , we constructed mrna target networks of these  <dig> mirnas with  <dig> nodes and  <dig>  arcs and  <dig> edges as shown in figure  <dig>  where  <dig> under expressed mirnas negatively regulated  <dig> overexpressed genes and  <dig> overexpressed mirna negatively regulated  <dig> underexpressed genes,  <dig>  arcs were mirna-mrna pairs,  <dig> edges connected coexpressed mirnas, and the remaining  <dig> edges linked coexpressed genes . the genes with large damage value or related to cancer in the gene coexpression network  were highlighted and marked in figure  <dig>  we extracted two subnetworks from figure  <dig>  the first subnetwork consisted of  <dig> genes  with damage values greater than  <dig> which were regulated by  <dig> mirnas  with damage values greater than  <dig>  the second subnetwork consisted of  <dig> under expressed cancer genes  which were regulated by  <dig> over expressed mirnas  in the mrna coexpression network. two subnetworks are shown in figure  <dig>  two subnetworks are involved in the synaptic transmission process. neuron communication occurs at the synapse via neurotransmitters. fbxw <dig> serves as a negative regulator of oncoprotein and is a general tumor suppressor. it has been reported that fbxw <dig> is implied in various cancers including glioblastoma  <cit> . gabra <dig> encodes a gamma-aminobutyric acid  receptor and gaba is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. myt1l  regulates nervous system development. both nefland nefm are neurofilaments. they play a role in intracellular transport to axons and dendrites. snap <dig> is a presynaptic plasma membrane protein and regulates neurotransmitter release. snap <dig> was reported to be implicated in neuritogenesis in human neuroblastoma  <cit> . both syt <dig> and vsnl <dig> serve as ca sensors in synaptic transmission  <cit> . syn <dig> is a member of the synapsin gene family, sv2b is a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein and rims <dig> regulates synaptic membrane exocytosis  <cit> .

third, the contribution of mirnas to the expression variation of some genes is very high. the proportion of expression variation of target genes explained by the linear influence of mirna variation can be measured by the coefficient of determination . in additional files  <dig>  there were a total of  <dig> under expressed genes with the coefficient of determination greater than 20% which was negatively regulated by  <dig> over expressed mirnas . surprisingly, up to 33% of the expression variations of the under expressed gene gcc <dig> were explained by a single over expressed mir- <dig>  functional roles of gcc <dig> in cancer are unknown. the gene with the second largest coefficient of determination was camk2n <dig>  over expressed mir-106b explained 28% of the expression variations. camk2n <dig> is reported to be a candidate tumor suppressor  <cit> . the function of camk2n <dig> is to inhibit mek/erk activity and induce p <dig> accumulation which negatively regulates cell-cycle progression. reducing expression of camk2n <dig> will accelerate tumor growth. 26% of the expression variation of cpeb <dig> that regulates synaptic plasticity and is implied in cancer development  <cit>  and grm <dig> that is involved in neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and implicated in melanoma  <cit>  was explained by overexpressed mir- <dig> and mir-15b, respectively. expressions of genes syt <dig>  snap <dig>  gabra <dig>  vsnl <dig>  myt1l, sv2b, syn <dig> and slc12a <dig> which were involved in synaptic transmission, were also largely regulated by mirnas.

decipher the path connecting mutations, expression and the gbm
unveiling the path from mutations to tumor formation will help us to uncover the mechanisms of the cancer. mutations often cause the formation of the tumor through their contributions to the variation of gene expressions or mirnas in the regulatory or signal transduction networks which in turn influence the development of the tumor  <cit> . interestingly, some genes harboring somatic mutations that were associated with gbm were also differentially expressed. genes tp <dig> , rb <dig> , and col3a <dig> were significantly differentially expressed. mki <dig> , chek <dig> , gstm <dig> , bcl11a  and fn <dig> were mildly differentially expressed. tp <dig> with a damage value of  <dig> and col3a <dig> with a damage value of  <dig> played a crucial role in the gene coexpression networks.

to study the function of somatic mutations and loh and connect them with disease through gene expressions and mirnas, we studied their cis or trans regulatory effects on gene or mirna expression traits. since the popular methods for eqtl analysis have mainly focused on testing cis or trans regulatory effects individually, their applications to testing cis or trans regulatory effects of rare somatic mutations and loh are inappropriate. we applied the group regression method to expression profiles of  <dig>  genes produced by affymetrix ht human genome u <dig> array plate set at mit  <cit>  and expression profiles of  <dig> human micrornas produced by agilent  <dig> × 15khuman mirna-specificmicroarray at the university of north carolina in  <dig> tumor tissue samples from glioblastoma patients  <cit> , which were shared among the gene expression, mirna expression and mutation datasets.

we first studied the cis regulatory effects of somatic mutations and loh on mrna or mirna expression traits. for somatic mutation, we found four cis-eqtl . p-values for testing association of somatic mutations in tp <dig>  egfr, nf <dig> and pik3c2g with their expressions were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. fold change  for the  <dig> genes were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. although regression analysis did not show significant association of somatic mutations in bcl11a, fn <dig> and col3a <dig> with their expressions due to very low frequencies of mutations, the fold change were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. we still observed some regulatory effects of somatic mutations on these two genes. for loh mutation, two cis-eqtl  were detected with p-values  <dig>  and  <dig>  and fold changes  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. regression analysis did not show significant association of loh mutations in the gene cyp1b <dig> with their expressions, but the fold change was  <dig> .

next we identify the trans-regulatory effects of somatic mutations and loh on mrna or mirna expression traits. the thresholds for declaring significant association of the set of somatic mutation and loh in the gene with mrna and mirna expression after bonferroni correction for multiple tests were  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. a network that connects  <dig> genes with somatic mutations associated with gbm, and their regulated mrnas and mirna expressions is shown in figure  <dig>  somatic mutations in these  <dig> genes were strongly correlated with expressions of  <dig> significantly differentially expressed genes,  <dig> of which were under expressed and  <dig> were over expressed in tumor tissue samples, a total of  <dig> trans gene eqtl were found . these mutations also significantly affected expressions of  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> of which were underexpressed and  <dig> were overexpressed and a total of  <dig> trans mirna eqtl were found . remarkably, we found  <dig> paths :  rb <dig> with association of somatic mutations with gbm regulated expressions of both gene lamp <dig> and mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> in turn targeted gene lamp2;  dst with association of somatic mutations regulated expressions of both gene otub <dig> and mir-15b, and mir-15b in turn targeted gene otub1;  fn <dig> with association of somatic mutations regulated expressions of both ssr <dig> and mir-125a, and mir-125a in turn targeted gene ssr2;  fn <dig> with association of somatic mutations regulated expressions of both gene tdg and mir-125a, and mir-125a in turn targeted gene tdg; and  tp <dig> with association of somatic mutations regulated expressions of both gene tp <dig> and mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> in turn targeted tp <dig>  similarly, figure  <dig> shows a network that connected  <dig> genes with loh associated with gmb, their regulated mrnas and mirna expressions. these  <dig> genes with loh as trans-eqtls affected  <dig> differentially expressed or interacted genes,  <dig> of which were under expressed and  <dig> were over expressed, a total of  <dig> trans gene-eqtl were found . the loh also affected expressions of  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> of which were underexpressed and  <dig> were overexpressed, and a total of  <dig> trans mirna-eqtl were found .

similar to the differentially expressed gene set enrichment analysis, we searched the enriched go and pathway groups for the eqtl gene list of every somatic/loh mutations by david bioinformatics resources  <cit> . the most enriched go terms included the molecular function term go:0015075~ion transmembrane transporter activity , biological process term go:0050877~neurological system process  and cellular component term go:0005643~nuclear pore  with p-values  <dig>  × 10- <dig>   <dig>  × 10- <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the enriched pathways included the wnt signaling pathway , colorectal cancer  and gap junction  with p-values  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. several examples are provided here, for the detailed results, see additional files  <dig> 

discussion
genetic and molecular alternations that are likely to cause tumor formation are often organized into complex biological networks. the purpose of this report is  to explore the possibility of integrating altered dna variations, mrna and mirna expression variations into multi-level complex genetic networks that contribute to tumorigenesis;  to decipher paths from somatic mutations and loh to tumor formation through genetic and molecular networks; and  to identify key genetic alternations causing tumor formation using network approaches. in the first step, we reconstruct single type molecular networks whose components are of the same type of molecules, either mrnas or mirnas. we reconstructed mrna coexpression networks and mirna coexpression networks for glioblastoma. the coexpression networks attempt to uncover the regulatory relationships among mrnas or mirnas. the second step is to reconstruct mirna target networks that connect mrna and mirna coexpression networks and indentify the eqtl network that connects mutations and mrna, mirna expression profiles.

we have addressed several issues for deciphering the paths from somatic mutations and loh to tumor formation. the first issue is how to test association of somatic mutations or loh with glioblastoma. we developed a group association test that is based on population genetics for assessing association of somatic mutations and loh with cancer. we identified  <dig> genes harboring somatic mutations associated with gbm and  <dig> genes harboring loh associated with glioblastoma. the second issue is how to uncover the components of mrna or mirna coexpression networks which respond to somatic mutations and loh associated with glioblastoma. traditionally, when alleles are common, these components are identified by mapping cis-eqtl or trans-eqtl. however, when alleles are rare, these components are hard to find by individually mapping cis-eqtl or trans-eqtl. the approach developed here is to extend group tests for a qualitative trait to a quantitative trait. the components that respond to perturbation of rare somatic genetic variants were identified by regressing the expression of an mrna or a mirna on the number of all mutated alleles across the gene. we discovered large comprehensive genetic and molecular networks that connect genes harboring associated mutations or loh, mrnas and mirnas. interestingly, we found five triangle cycles in the networks which indicated that significantly associated somatic mutations or loh regulated both differentially expressed mrna and mirna and the mirna in turn also affected expression levels of the mrna. the approach presented here has two remarkable features. first, it offered a powerful tool for differentiating driver mutations from passenger mutations. second, it provides functional information on how somatic mutations or loh lead to tumorigenesis through complex genetic and molecular networks.

our studies support the hypothesis that cancer may be the emergent properties of many genetic variants that are highly interconnected. genetic and environmental stimuli can be viewed as random attacks to genetic and molecular networks. topological properties of the genetic and molecular networks are closely related to the function of cells. cancer arises from the failure of networks to respond to attacks. in other words, the attacked networks are unable to return to their normal states and remain functional in the face of random perturbations. we suspect that key components of a network contributing to the robustness of the network also play an important role in the function of the cells. we modeled over or under expression of mrnas and mirnas, and genetic alternations as deletions of a node in the network which will cause dynamical changes in the network and used a damage value of the node to measure its contribution to the robustness of the network. we found that several cancers related genes such as tp <dig> have large damage values in the genetic and molecular networks. these key components in the network may serve as therapeutic intervention points.

our results are preliminary. although network analysis may have the potential to unravel the mechanism of tumor initiation and progression, the presented network structures and their properties in this report may depend on sampled tissues. whether the structures of our reconstructed network can be replicated in other tissues or not is the key to the success of network analysis in cancer studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we use system biology and network approaches to develop novel analytical strategies for  systematically integrating altered dna variations, mrna and mirna expression variations into multi-level complex genetic networks that contribute to tumorigenesis,  deciphering paths from somatic and loh mutations to tumor formation through genetic networks and  identifying key genetic alternations causing tumor formation by network analysis.
