BACKGROUND
a fundamental problem for all multicellular animals is that they must respond to invading pathogens while simultaneously tolerating or facilitating the growth of commensal microbes. evidence has been mounting that metazoans can recognize pathogens by detecting the activity of so-called pathogen-encoded virulence effectors  <cit> . although significant advances have been made in understanding how these immune triggers are sensed, it is poorly understood how they activate the defense responses that lead to the protection of host tissues from pathogen-inflicted damage and ultimately to the resolution of infection.

to investigate these issues, we study the nematode caenorhabditis elegans which, when exposed to human pathogens, activates multiple discrete immune signaling pathways including an evolutionary conserved p <dig> mapk pathway that is also critical for mammalian immunity  <cit> . for c. elegans infected with the gram-negative nosocomial pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa, deployment of these signaling pathways and resulting gene induction is directly correlated with bacterial virulence  <cit> , leading us to hypothesize that p. aeruginosa virulence factors may themselves trigger host immune gene expression. to test this theory, in previously published work, we screened for individual p. aeruginosa effectors that are capable of inducing a host immune response and discovered that exposure to exotoxin a  upregulates c. elegans immune genes  <cit> . toxa is an extremely potent toxin of the ab class that inhibits protein translation by catalyzing the adp-ribosylation of elongation factor  <dig>  the same reaction catalyzed by diphtheria toxin from corynebacterium diphtheriae and cholix toxin from vibrio cholerae  <cit> . the high level of toxicity of these enzymes has enabled their use as immunotoxins to treat a variety of cancers  <cit> .

we determined that c. elegans recognizes toxa independently of toxa per se by detecting its enzymatic activity, translational inhibition  <cit> . significantly, this immune activation is independent of physical microbial features called microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns  or pattern recognition receptors, which are the traditionally studied mechanisms of pathogen recognition. dunbar et al.  <cit>  similarly discovered that inhibiting host translation stimulates the mamp/pamp-independent upregulation of the c. elegans zip- <dig> transcription factor resulting in zip-2-dependent gene induction. mammalian cells are also able to sense pathogens by recognizing protein synthesis abnormalities; translational inhibitors secreted by legionella pneumophila activate nf-κb and map kinase signaling and trigger the transcription of their target genes  <cit> , a subset of which are also upregulated at the protein level  <cit> . additional cellular processes commonly targeted by bacterial effectors are monitored through similar surveillance mechanisms  <cit> . while a commonality of all these effector-triggered mechanisms is that they require either injury or modification to the host, the host genetic circuits that respond to these insults and act to protect against subsequent effector-mediated damage are only beginning to be understood. we therefore used the c. elegans/toxa system to identify and characterize new components of surveillance signaling pathways.

here, we investigate the genetic pathways that enable nematodes to mitigate the damaging effects of toxa-mediated translational inhibition. using an automated c. elegans lifespan machine  <cit> , we show that the c. elegans nipi- <dig> gene is required for animals to survive exposure to toxa as well as to p. aeruginosa. nipi- <dig> is a member of the highly conserved, functionally diverse tribbles protein family, which, when mutated, has been linked to a variety of disorders related to cell signaling, immunity, metabolism, and cancer  <cit> . nipi- <dig> has been previously shown to function upstream of p <dig> mapk in the epidermis during fungal attacks  <cit>  and, more recently, it has been determined to be required in multiple tissues during development . through partial loss-of-function and rescue studies, we find here that the c. elegans immune response against toxa and p. aeruginosa is mediated in adult animals by intestinal nipi- <dig> which, in contrast to epidermal nipi- <dig>  does not directly function in known c. elegans immune pathways but instead represses the activity of the bzip c/ebp transcription factor cebp- <dig> 


RESULTS
nipi- <dig> mutants are hypersusceptible to translational inhibitors and pseudomonas aeruginosa
we previously found that toxa does not irreparably damage healthy c. elegans as wild type animals have the same longevity when feeding on an e. coli strain expressing p. aeruginosa pa <dig> toxa as on control bacteria  <cit> . however, nematodes defective in immune signaling pathways, such as the p <dig> mapk pathway, die rapidly when fed toxa e. coli  <cit> , implying that c. elegans normally resist this highly toxic enzyme through an effective host defense. we reasoned that genes upregulated in response to toxa might be required to protect against or recover from toxin-induced damage and allow wild type worms to survive. through genome-wide transcriptional profiling using affymetrix genechips©, we previously identified  <dig> genes that were upregulated in wild type n <dig> c. elegans fed toxa  <cit> .

using rnai or mutant alleles corresponding to  <dig> of the most highly upregulated genes , we assayed for premature lethality in worms fed toxa and found that the nipi- <dig> mutant exhibited the most significant reduction in lifespan . in our previous microarray analysis, nipi- <dig> was upregulated  <dig> -fold in worms exposed to toxa for 24 hours and was one of the two most highly induced kinases  <cit> . whereas nipi- <dig> null mutants arrest by larval development stage l <dig> , nipi- <dig> is a fully viable hypomorphic allele, which, as described below, has allowed us to selectively address nipi-3’s role in pathogen defense. nipi- <dig> contains a single mutation  in a conserved residue in the kinase domain  <cit> .

using a c. elegans lifespan machine, a modified commercial flatbed scanner in conjunction with automated image analysis software  <cit> , we analyzed the survival of the nipi- <dig> mutant feeding on toxa and found that nipi- <dig> had a dramatically reduced lifespan on this food compared to wild type animals . although nipi- <dig> has been reported to have a shortened lifespan  <cit> , its longevity on toxa was significantly shorter than on a control, non-pathogenic bl <dig> e. coli strain , whereas the lifespans of wild type n <dig> worms on control bl <dig> e. coli or on toxa were equivalent   <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
nipi- <dig> mutants have reduced resistance to toxa, g <dig> and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a lifespans of wild type n <dig>  nipi- <dig>  and three independent lines of nipi- <dig> expressing wild type nipi-3p::nipi- <dig> fed e. coli expressing toxa starting at the l <dig> stage. p <  <dig>  comparing nipi- <dig> and wild type . b fraction of synchronized l <dig> worms that grew to at least young adult stage after 3 days at 20 °c on plates containing the indicated g <dig> concentration. results shown are an average of four biological replicates. error bars represent sd. *p <  <dig>  compared to wild type animals at the given concentration . c lifespans of wild type n <dig>  nipi- <dig>  and nipi- <dig> expressing wild type nipi-3p::nipi- <dig> fed on p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  nipi-3;agex <dig> indicates non-transgenic offspring of nipi-3p::nipi- <dig> transgenic worms. p <  <dig>  comparing nipi- <dig> and wild type . number of animals scored for each condition was ≥  <dig>  and >  <dig> . these are representative experiments of two independent experiments. primary data for panel b are provided in additional file 15





we previously showed that c. elegans immune-related signaling pathways, including the pmk- <dig> p <dig> mapk pathway, are activated by toxa-mediated translational inhibition rather than by toxa itself. we therefore tested whether nipi- <dig> mutants are also defective in their response to the protein synthesis inhibitor g <dig>  similar to pmk- <dig> mutants, nipi- <dig> animals were more sensitive to g <dig> than wild type animals, indicating that nipi- <dig> protects the host against translational inhibition and not an unrelated aspect of toxa intoxication . finally, we reasoned that nipi- <dig> is likely to be required for c. elegans defense against p. aeruginosa, which produces toxa. indeed, nipi- <dig> mutants were hypersusceptible to p. aeruginosa in large-lawn automated assays in which c. elegans animals were unable to avoid being in contact with the bacterial lawn . reintroduction of wild type nipi- <dig> expressed by its own promoter rescued the hypersusceptibility of nipi- <dig> to toxa and p. aeruginosa .

to confirm that nipi- <dig> is not merely sensitive to any stressor, but is distinctly susceptible to translational inhibitors, we compared the ability of wild type and nipi- <dig> worms to recover from prolonged developmental arrest. animals were arrested at the first larval stage and then starved for up to 14 days . longer starvation reduces the number of animals that can recover upon feeding and grow to adults. escaping this starvation-induced arrest requires the coordination of multiple pathways, including those required for general lifespan and stress responses  <cit> . in this assay, nipi- <dig> recovery was equivalent to wild type , indicating that nipi- <dig> is not broadly susceptible to any stressful condition.

immune genes are misregulated in nipi- <dig> mutants
we previously found that toxa-sensitive mutants, such as pmk- <dig>  misregulate pathogen-responsive genes  <cit> , suggesting that nipi- <dig> animals will show similar transcriptional defects. however, unlike for pmk- <dig>  complete loss of nipi- <dig> function causes animals to arrest at the l2/l <dig> larval stage  indicating that nipi- <dig> is critical to both development and immunity. thus, to understand the potential relationship between these processes and to dissect apart nipi-3’s apparent roles in both development and immunity, we performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling assays using affymetrix genechips® comparing wild type, nipi- <dig>  and pmk- <dig> animals that were fed control op <dig> e. coli. surprisingly, we found that a large number of genes were significantly upregulated in nipi- <dig> mutants:  <dig> genes were upregulated in nipi- <dig>  whereas, for comparison, only  <dig> genes were induced in pmk- <dig> . gene ontology  term analysis showed that transcripts upregulated in nipi- <dig> mutants were enriched for processes involved in immunity, similar to the go terms enriched among the  <dig> genes downregulated in pmk- <dig> animals , suggesting nipi- <dig> may be a negative immune regulator. the only other overrepresented go terms among the nipi-3-upregulated genes involved flavonoid processes  due to the presence of  <dig> udp-glucuronosyltransferases which, in addition to modifying flavonoids in plants, metabolize and detoxify xenobiotic compounds in metazoans  <cit> . there were no enriched go categories for the  <dig> genes downregulated in nipi- <dig> or the  <dig> genes upregulated in pmk- <dig> animals. these gene expression results indicate that, similar to pmk- <dig>  the nipi- <dig> allele is specifically defective in immune processes and that we can use nipi- <dig> to study the role of nipi- <dig> in pathogen defense separately from its role in development.

to expand on the microarray results and test the effect of nipi- <dig> on immune gene expression under different conditions, we utilized a nanostring© codeset containing  <dig> c. elegans genes involved in immune- and stress-related responses . nanostring analysis recapitulated the microarray gene expression changes observed between wild type and nipi- <dig> mutant animals under normal growth conditions. we confirmed that  <dig> of the  <dig> codeset genes predicted to be nipi-3-dependent from the microarray data were similarly affected in the nanostring analysis; the remaining gene was upregulated  <dig> ×  < 1 × 10–2), falling just below the two-fold cutoff. an additional  <dig> nanostring codeset genes that were not identified as being differentially regulated by microarray analysis were also statistically significantly up- or downregulated in nipi- <dig>  suggesting that the microarray analysis is either less sensitive or more stringent than nanostring.

we next asked whether immune- and stress-related genes are misregulated in nipi- <dig> mutants fed p. aeruginosa or toxa, potentially explaining the hypersusceptibility of nipi- <dig> to these conditions. of the  <dig> codeset genes,  <dig> were differentially expressed when comparing nipi- <dig> and wild type animals exposed to p. aeruginosa and  <dig> were affected in nipi- <dig> compared to wild type when fed toxa . in general, genes regulated by nipi- <dig> were differentially expressed under multiple conditions ; for example, 77% of the genes altered in nipi- <dig> on op <dig> were also altered in nipi- <dig> on p. aeruginosa. we confirmed the microarray and nanostring gene expression changes for a subset of genes using qrt-pcr to analyze wild type and nipi- <dig> animals fed p. aeruginosa, toxa, or their respective control bacteria .

in support of the hypothesis that nipi- <dig> is an immune regulator, 44%  of the genes up or down regulated in nipi- <dig> animals on control op <dig> bacteria were also responsive to toxa or the translational inhibitor hygromycin b  as shown by comparing the current microarray dataset with our previous characterization of the wild type toxa/hygromycin b response  <cit> . in addition, genes differentially expressed in nipi- <dig> fed p. aeruginosa or toxa compared to wild type animals on the same food were enriched for pathogen-response genes . taken together, these data demonstrate that nipi- <dig> is necessary for the proper expression of immune genes in both unstressed and infected animals.

toxa induces defense proteins in wild type but not in nipi- <dig> animals
we next sought to determine the role of nipi- <dig> on the host’s protein response to translational inhibitors since the extent to which mrna up or downregulation affects protein expression under these conditions is unknown. we performed a large-scale quantitative proteomic analysis comparing wild type and nipi- <dig> animals fed on toxa or control bl <dig> e. coli. this analysis detected a total of  <dig> expressed proteins that map to  <dig> unique c. elegans genes, representing approximately half of the genes expressed in adult animals  <cit> .

we first characterized the protein changes that occur in wild type animals under translational stress. of the  <dig> proteins that significantly changed in wild type upon toxa exposure,  <dig> were upregulated and related to immunity based on go term analysis . the induction of immune-related factors by toxa was consistent with our previously published analysis of toxa-mediated rna changes  <cit> . however, unlike wild type animals, exposing nipi- <dig> mutants to toxa caused more proteins to be downregulated than upregulated,  <dig> versus  <dig>  respectively . there was almost no overlap between the nipi- <dig> and wild type responses to toxa: only one protein was downregulated in both strains  and there were no common upregulated proteins. there were no enriched go terms among the proteins up or downregulated by toxa in nipi- <dig> consistent with the nipi- <dig> mutant mounting an uncoordinated, and ultimately ineffective, response to the toxin.fig.  <dig> different proteins are up and downregulated in wild type n <dig> and nipi- <dig> animals following toxa exposure. change of protein abundance in wild type n <dig> and nipi- <dig> animals following 24 hours feeding on e. coli expressing toxa starting at the l <dig> stage as compared to animals fed control bl <dig> food. only proteins significantly up or downregulated in wild type n <dig> and/or nipi- <dig> are included. the red arrow points to the only protein  significantly altered in both n <dig> and nipi- <dig> animals. results shown are an average of two biological replicates. primary data are provided in additional file 8: table s5




to directly address the relationship between transcript and protein changes in the presence of toxa, we compared the proteomic data to the transcriptional profiling analysis that we previously performed using the same toxa and control strains  <cit> . of the  <dig> transcripts induced or repressed by toxa in wild type worms, we identified  <dig> corresponding proteins and, of those,  <dig>  were significantly affected by toxa . eight of the  <dig> rnas with the highest toxa induction were also elevated at the protein level. to understand how a protein inhibitor impacts the relationship between rna and protein expression, we performed the same type of analysis using unstressed conditions lacking translational inhibitors. specifically, we analyzed transcriptional and proteomic changes in nipi- <dig> compared to wild type animals fed on control e. coli   <cit> . while  <dig> of the  <dig> rnas with the highest induction in nipi- <dig> also had elevated protein levels, overall, there was less correlation between rna and protein changes as only 12%  of nipi-3-affected rnas showed significantly altered protein expression. in addition, there were  <dig> proteins differentially expressed in nipi- <dig> that were unaffected at the rna level . one interpretation for the poorer correlation in the nipi-3/wild type control analysis versus the toxa/bl <dig> analysis is that rnas induced during translational disruption have less post-transcriptional regulation than rnas in unstressed conditions. however, a caveat of the nipi- <dig> comparison is that different e. coli strains were used as controls in the transcriptomic and proteomic analyses .

intestinal nipi- <dig> defends against intestinal pathogens
to confer resistance against the intestinal pathogen p. aeruginosa, nipi- <dig> must act directly or indirectly in the intestine. nipi- <dig> is expressed in multiple tissues in the adult c. elegans and was previously shown to function in the hypodermis but not the intestine to defend against the hypodermal fungal pathogen d. coniospora  <cit> . to determine whether the toxa response is mediated by intestinally-expressed nipi- <dig> or a systemic signal derived from hypodermally-expressed nipi- <dig> and transported to the intestine, we knocked down nipi- <dig> in either the intestine or hypodermis using tissue-specific rnai c. elegans strains. we confirmed the tissue-specificity of these strains with bacterial rnai clones targeting different tissues. we did not observe any silencing phenotypes in the gut-specific rnai strain for rnai clones targeting genes in the hypodermis, body wall muscle, or germline, but we did detect low levels of rnai silencing in non-hypodermal tissues in the hypodermal-specific rnai strain . knocking down nipi- <dig> in a gut-specific rnai strain made animals hypersusceptible to toxa and p. aeruginosa , whereas knocking down nipi- <dig> in the hypodermal rnai strain did not result in increased toxa susceptibility compared to control rnai , even though there was a low level of silencing in the intestine hypodermal rnai strain . to confirm that intestinal nipi- <dig> is responsible for the gene expression changes observed in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and 6: tables s <dig>  s <dig>  and figure s <dig>  we performed qrt-pcr of infection-related genes in either wild type or gut-specific rnai animals following nipi- <dig> rnai. in both strains, five of the transcripts were upregulated and six were downregulated . some transcripts showed a larger difference in wild type animals than in the gut-specific rnai strain, which was potentially due to a difference in rnai efficiency or indicates nipi- <dig> has some activity in a non-gut tissue.fig.  <dig> intestinal nipi- <dig> expression is necessary and sufficient for resistance against toxa and p. aeruginosa.

finally, we tested whether nipi- <dig> is also required in additional tissues by rescuing nipi- <dig> only in the intestine of nipi- <dig> mutants. expressing intestinal nipi- <dig> was sufficient to rescue the nipi- <dig> toxa defect . taken together, the data in fig.  <dig> show that intestinal nipi- <dig> is both necessary and sufficient to mediate c. elegans toxa defense mechanisms. importantly, in contrast to knocking down nipi- <dig> systemically, removing nipi- <dig> only in the intestine did not result in a shortened lifespan on control food, and in fact appeared to enhance the lifespan . this latter experiment emphasizes that the role of nipi- <dig> in pathogen defense can be separated from its lifespan and developmental effects.

intestinal nipi- <dig> is not a primary component of known toxa-response pathways including pmk- <dig> p <dig> or kgb- <dig> jnk-like map kinase
we next asked whether intestinal nipi- <dig> is a component of known immune signaling pathways. previous work has shown that, in the hypodermis, nipi- <dig> functions upstream of the pmk- <dig> p <dig> mapk pathway and between the protein kinase c tpa- <dig> and bip/grp <dig> chaperone hsp- <dig>  <cit> . however, unlike nipi- <dig> animals, tpa- <dig> and hsp- <dig> mutants had a normal lifespan on toxa  indicating that nipi- <dig> has different functions in the hypodermis and intestine.

in contrast to hsp- <dig> and tpa- <dig>  pmk- <dig> mutants die rapidly on toxa  <cit>  and the mammalian tribbles homolog trib <dig> is required for p <dig> phosphorylation in mammalian cells  <cit> , suggesting that nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> may function together. if nipi- <dig> indeed functions solely upstream of or in conjunction with pmk- <dig>  we reasoned that pmk- <dig> phosphorylation levels should be similar in nipi- <dig> animals to the levels observed in sek- <dig>  mutants  <cit> . however, whereas pmk- <dig> phosphorylation is apparently decreased in nipi- <dig> compared to wild type worms, it is still present at a significantly higher level than in a sek- <dig> mutant . we also tested whether pmk- <dig> and nipi- <dig> regulate common downstream genes as would be predicted if they are components of the same pathway. from our microarray analysis of animals on control op <dig> e. coli, there was almost no overlap between nipi-3- and pmk-1-regulated genes ; only  <dig> of the  <dig> genes downregulated in nipi- <dig> were repressed in pmk- <dig> and, of the  <dig> genes upregulated in nipi- <dig>   <dig> were upregulated and  <dig> were downregulated in pmk- <dig> . we additionally analyzed the protein expression of nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> mutants exposed to toxa and detected no proteins in common between the  <dig> upregulated in nipi- <dig> and the  <dig> induced in pmk- <dig> when comparing each to wild type worms on toxa . somewhat surprisingly,  <dig> proteins were repressed in both nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> from a total of  <dig> pmk-1-downregulated and  <dig> nipi-3-downregulated proteins.fig.  <dig> nipi- <dig> is not immediately up or downstream of pmk- <dig> p <dig> mapk or kgb- <dig> jnk-like pathways. a western blot analysis of phosphorylated pmk- <dig> in l <dig> animals of the indicated genotype raised on control op <dig> e. coli. b transcript fold changes determined by microarray analysis of nipi- <dig> or pmk- <dig> animals as compared to wild type n <dig> raised on op <dig> e. coli. only genes significantly altered in nipi- <dig> are shown. c lifespans of wild type n <dig> and pmk- <dig>  or kgb- <dig>  fed e. coli expressing toxa following either nipi- <dig> or l <dig> vector control rnai. p <  <dig>  comparing pmk- <dig> and pmk- <dig>  nipi- <dig> and comparing kgb- <dig> and kgb-1; nipi- <dig> . number of animals scored for each condition was ≥  <dig>  and >  <dig> . these are representative experiments of two  or three  independent experiments. primary data for panel b are provided in additional file 3: table s2




finally, consistent with nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> mediating separate signaling pathways, we found that animals lacking both nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> had an increased susceptibility to toxa as compared to loss of either protein alone . a caveat of this experiment, however, is that the lifespan of the pmk-1;nipi- <dig> animals on control food was also shortened . taken together, while there may be some cross-talk between the nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> pathways, our gene expression and pathogen-susceptibility data are not consistent with a model in which nipi- <dig> functions directly up or downstream of pmk- <dig> 

we next focused on the kgb- <dig> jnk-like mapk pathway since, like nipi- <dig>  kgb- <dig> is required for resistance to p. aeruginosa and acts in parallel to pmk- <dig>   <cit> . in addition, mammalian trib <dig> has a role in jnk phosphorylation  <cit> . while we found that kgb- <dig> mutants were hypersusceptible to toxa, loss of both kgb- <dig> and nipi- <dig> resulted in an additive toxa effect compared to loss of either gene alone . however, as with the pmk- <dig> analysis, the lifespan for kgb-1;nipi- <dig> on control e. coli was attenuated compared to loss of only kgb- <dig> or nipi- <dig> . therefore, we asked whether kgb- <dig> and nipi- <dig> regulate the same set of downstream genes. we determined that none of the eight toxa-response genes assayed by qrt-pcr were regulated by both kgb- <dig> and nipi- <dig> on control e. coli and toxa , consistent with kgb- <dig> and nipi- <dig> acting in parallel.

finally, the bzip transcription factor zip- <dig> and g-protein coupled receptor fshr- <dig> regulate different subsets of toxa-response genes and function separately from the pmk- <dig> and kgb- <dig> pathways   <cit> . as was the case with pmk- <dig> and kgb- <dig>  there was no overlap between the transcripts significantly altered in zip- <dig> or fshr- <dig> and nipi- <dig> mutants on control e. coli and p. aeruginosa . in addition, zip- <dig> and fshr- <dig> mutants were much less sensitive to toxa than nipi- <dig> , making it unlikely that either zip- <dig> or fshr- <dig> are in a linear pathway with nipi- <dig> 

nipi- <dig> genetically interacts with the c/ebp bzip transcription factor cebp- <dig> to promote toxa resistance
based on the epistasis analyses, nipi- <dig> represents either the first identified factor of a new signaling pathway acting in parallel to pmk- <dig> or it functions to modulate multiple pathways and coordinate the downstream effects of different initial inputs. if nipi- <dig> represents a separate branch of immune signaling, we reasoned that we should be able to identify distinct factors functioning downstream of nipi- <dig>  to test this, we mutagenized nipi- <dig> animals with ems and identified  <dig> mutants with increased resistance to toxa . we selected two mutants with the strongest phenotypes from two independent pools for further analysis. through whole genome sequencing, we found that both mutants contained an a246v mutation in the dna binding domain of the c/ebp bzip transcription factor cebp- <dig>  when exposed to toxa or p. aeruginosa, both the newly-discovered cebp- <dig> allele as well as a previously-isolated cebp- <dig> deletion allele , completely suppressed the nipi- <dig> defect in both infection conditions as compared to wild type animals . however, the single cebp- <dig> mutants survived longer on toxa than wild type worms and the double cebp- <dig>  nipi- <dig> mutants were slightly shorter lived on toxa than their single cebp- <dig> mutant counterparts  suggesting that nipi- <dig> may have a minor additional function in a non-cebp- <dig> pathway to protect against toxa. cebp- <dig> mutants also suppress the nipi- <dig> lifespan defect as the lifespans of the single cebp- <dig> and double cebp- <dig>  nipi- <dig> mutants were equivalent on control e. coli .fig.  <dig> 
nipi- <dig> survival defects are suppressed by loss of cebp- <dig> but not loss of pmk- <dig> or dlk- <dig>  lifespans of the indicated strains on e. coli expressing toxa , p. aeruginosa pa <dig> , or control bl <dig> e. coli . nipi- <dig> was used for all assays. cebp- <dig>  dlk- <dig>  and pmk- <dig> were inhibited by rnai in c. number of animals scored for each condition was >  <dig> , >  <dig> , >  <dig> , and >  <dig> . these are representative experiments of two independent experiments




cebp- <dig> is expressed in pharyngeal, neuronal and intestinal cells  <cit> , and is known to function in neurons during axon regeneration  <cit> . therefore, we asked whether cebp- <dig> acts in the intestine to mediate toxa defenses. to test this, we used the gut-specific rnai strain described above and compared its susceptibility to toxa following knockdown of either nipi- <dig> or cebp- <dig> or of both genes simultaneously. while loss of intestinal nipi- <dig> resulted in toxa hypersusceptibility, animals with co-knockdown of intestinal nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> had an equivalent lifespan on toxa as those lacking only intestinal cebp- <dig> , indicating that cebp- <dig> mediates the toxa defense by functioning in the intestine.

in neurons, cebp- <dig> acts downstream of the dlk-1/pmk- <dig> p <dig> mapk pathway  <cit>  and so we determined whether dlk- <dig> and pmk- <dig> are also involved in the nipi- <dig> intestinal immune pathway. we found that the pmk- <dig> pathway is not necessary for the toxa defense since, unlike rnai-mediated knockdown of cebp- <dig>  rnai of dlk- <dig> or pmk- <dig> did not suppress the toxa sensitivity of nipi- <dig> .

finally, since loss of nipi- <dig> results in immune gene misexpression , we tested whether cebp- <dig> rescues nipi-3’s pathogen survival phenotype by restoring wild type gene expression levels during toxa intoxication. using qrt-pcr, we compared wild type animals with single nipi- <dig> and cebp- <dig> mutants as well as double nipi- <dig>  cebp- <dig> mutants. for some genes, such as t24b <dig> , the nipi- <dig> defect was partially rescued in the double nipi- <dig>  cebp- <dig> mutants but, for others, such as f11d <dig> , the double mutants showed stronger misregulation than nipi- <dig> alone . a major limitation of this experiment, however, is that it is unknown which nipi-3-dependent genes are essential for the toxa response. we attempted to identify critical effector proteins acting downstream of nipi-3/cebp- <dig> by asking whether any of the individual proteins differentially regulated in nipi- <dig> could account for the pathogen sensitivity of these mutants. to mimic the defects in nipi- <dig>  for proteins downregulated in nipi- <dig>  we knocked down the corresponding genes by rnai in wild type worms and assayed for worms that phenocopied the nipi- <dig> toxa susceptibility. we similarly inhibited the proteins that were upregulated in nipi- <dig> using rnai in nipi- <dig> mutants and examined whether these animals survived longer on toxa. however, we found no major changes in toxa sensitivity following these knockdowns .

discussion
in this study, we find that nipi- <dig> is an essential component of the c. elegans defense against the translational inhibitor toxa as well as p. aeruginosa, the bacterial pathogen that secretes toxa. unlike other previously described immune signaling genes, including pmk- <dig>  nipi- <dig> is upregulated by toxa. perhaps counterintuitively, loss of nipi- <dig> results in the upregulation of many toxa-inducible genes in the absence of translational inhibition. this does not occur for the toxa-sensitive pmk- <dig> mutant in which immune and stress genes are overall downregulated compared to wild type animals and suggests that nipi- <dig> may have a specialized inhibitory role in responding to translational inhibitors.

nipi- <dig> plays critical roles in both development and immunity, analogous to other key innate immune signaling molecules such as the toll receptors in drosophila  <cit>  and bar- <dig> β-catenin in c. elegans  <cit> . while null mutations in nipi- <dig> cause animals to arrest by the l <dig> stage , the use of the fully viable nipi- <dig> hypomorphic allele has allowed us to specifically investigate nipi-3’s role in pathogen defense. through tissue-specific rnai and rescue experiments, we determined that nipi-3-mediated toxa and p. aeruginosa defenses are controlled in adult animals by intestinally expressed nipi- <dig>  consistent with p. aeruginosa being a c. elegans intestinal pathogen. previous reports show that hypodermal but not intestinal expression of nipi- <dig> is important for survival against the hypodermal pathogen d. coniospora  <cit> . a simple explanation of these data is that, in late larval stage and adult animals, following the requirement for nipi- <dig> in development, nipi- <dig> is only necessary in the tissue that is under pathogenic attack, which implies that it functions autonomously to mediate local immune responses. alternatively, it is also possible that intestinally- and hypodermally-expressed nipi- <dig> regulate different immune mechanisms, with the intestinal responses effective against toxa-like molecules and the hypodermal responses effective against distinct pathogenic mechanisms of d. coniospora. supporting the hypothesis that nipi- <dig> may have unique functions in different tissues, we show here that the immune signaling molecules hsp- <dig> and tpa- <dig>  which function in the hypodermal nipi- <dig> pathway  <cit> , are dispensable for mounting toxa resistance in the intestine, even though, as with nipi- <dig>  they are expressed in the intestine  <cit> .

in contrast to hsp- <dig> and tpa- <dig>  pmk- <dig> mutants are hypersensitive to toxa and the translational inhibitor g <dig> but nipi- <dig> does not appear to function strictly upstream or downstream of p <dig> mapk in response to toxa. microarray analysis of pmk- <dig> and nipi- <dig> l <dig> animals, the stage exposed to toxa in our standard assay, revealed that the gene expression signature in these two mutants is remarkably different on control op <dig> bacteria. however, there may be some interplay between nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> because the overall level of activated pmk- <dig> was reduced in l <dig> nipi- <dig> animals. upon exposure to toxa, most of the proteins that changed in the young adult nipi- <dig> mutant animals exhibited an increase over wild type, whereas the opposite was true for the pmk- <dig> mutant animals, where many more proteins were downregulated. while the majority of overall proteins differentially expressed in nipi- <dig> or pmk- <dig> on toxa did not overlap, a subset of proteins downregulated in nipi- <dig> mutant animals were also reduced in the pmk- <dig> mutant, suggesting that either these are a signature of worms dying from toxa exposure or there is a commonality in the nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> responses to toxa. however, we argue that nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> primarily function in parallel for their response to the toxin because reduction of nipi- <dig> activity by rnai in the pmk- <dig> null mutant resulted in increased hypersusceptibility to toxa. interestingly, and in contrast to our p. aeruginosa data, nipi- <dig> acts upstream of the p <dig> mapk signaling cassette  in the hypodermis to regulate the induction of anti-microbial peptides in response to d. coniospora  <cit> . in addition, mutations in the p <dig> pmk- <dig> mapk pathway suppress nipi-3-dependent developmental arrest and nipi- <dig> null mutant animals hyperactive pmk- <dig> at early larval stages . combining these studies, it is clear that there are multiple regulatory interactions between nipi- <dig> and pmk- <dig> across different developmental stages and tissues and these likely contribute to the varied functions of nipi- <dig> 

for adult nipi- <dig> animals exposed to p. aeruginosa or toxa, their shortened lifespan can be completely suppressed by loss of the c/ebp bzip transcription factor cebp- <dig>  removal of cebp- <dig> does not cause c. elegans to be hypersusceptible to toxa, suggesting it normally functions as a negative regulator. therefore, the explanation for nipi- <dig> lethality on toxa is that cebp- <dig> function is now increased, making nipi- <dig> a negative regulator of cebp- <dig> . in support of this model, kim et al.  found that cebp- <dig> transcription is increased in the nipi- <dig> mutant and there is a remarkable overlap in the gene classes enriched in cebp- <dig> targets and those repressed by nipi- <dig>  specifically in the “stress cluster” . finally, other tribbles proteins are also known to promote degradation of target proteins, including mapks and c/ebp proteins  <cit> . it should be noted that cebp- <dig> mrna and protein were upregulated in nipi- <dig> animals, although these inductions were not statistically significant.fig.  <dig> model of major c. elegans pathways involved in toxa defenses




while the cebp- <dig> ag <dig> allele results in a relatively minor change in cebp- <dig>  this mutation has been isolated independently at least three times: twice in this study and once by bounoutas et al.  <cit>  in a neuronal mutagenesis screen that identified cebp- <dig> as a suppressor of the microtubule disrupter colchicine, which normally causes a general decrease in protein expression in c. elegans touch receptor neurons. unlike in our study, mutations in the pmk- <dig> p <dig> mapk phenocopy the loss of neuronal cebp- <dig>  for both our study and that of bournoutas et al.  <cit> , regardless of the upstream pathway, cebp- <dig> is detrimental to mitigating the effects of translational inhibitors, either toxa or colchicine. interestingly, another c/ebp transcription factor, cebp- <dig>  has also recently been shown to play an important role in c. elegans translational defense. however, unlike cebp- <dig>  cebp- <dig> promotes toxa and p. aeruginosa protective mechanisms by acting as a heterodimeric transcription factor with zip- <dig>  <cit> . the ability of cebp proteins to both promote and repress protective host defenses against the same pathogen demonstrates the range of cebp immune functions and raises the question of whether, for example, cebp- <dig> could be a positive effector under a different condition.

the mechanism by which translational inhibitors activate the nipi-3/cebp- <dig> pathway remains an open question. dunbar et al.  <cit>  discovered that zip- <dig> accumulation during a p. aeruginosa infection is mediated by open reading frames in the zip- <dig> 5’utr . this pathogen-mediated increase in translation is potentially similar to the response of yeast gcn <dig> and mammalian atf <dig> to nutritional stresses and translational inhibition  <cit> . however, we did not observe uorfs in the nipi- <dig> 5’utr. moreover, proteins induced by toxa in wild type worms were not enriched for uorfs, implying that additional activation mechanisms must be present. one such strategy may be linked to transcript abundance; ivanov and roy  <cit>  found that the most abundant transcripts could bypass the general protein synthesis block caused by l. pneumophila translational inhibitors. however, a similar study by asrat et al.  <cit>  found that translation of the il-1β cytokine was independent of its transcript stability, suggesting that increasing a transcript’s concentration is not sufficient to ensure its protein expression. another mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation could be mediated by a second protein such as a labile repressor that is not synthesized when translation is disrupted. this is observed at the transcriptional level in mammalian macrophages when l. pneumophila translational inhibitors block the production of new nfκb repressor iκb, resulting in increased gene expression  <cit> . it is possible that, if it exists, such a suppressor could be identified in further c. elegans screening.

future studies are also likely to identify additional mechanisms for activating surveillance immune pathways and may identify strategies employed by the pathogens to suppress them. a striking finding from this study is the approximately 40% correlation between transcript and protein changes in the worms following toxa exposure, which is comparable to other published studies analyzing a variety of conditions  <cit>  and suggests that, after a 24 hour exposure, toxa does not globally affect post-transcriptional processing. however, toxa expressed by the p. aeruginosa strain pa <dig> is able to broadly reduce c. elegans protein synthesis  <cit> , which may indicate that p. aeruginosa expresses effectors to inhibit the nematode’s toxa defense.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown here that nipi- <dig> enables hosts to survive pathogen-mediated damage to protein translation. nipi- <dig> mediates post-developmental immunity in the intestine by acting as a negative regulator of the c/ebp transcription factor cebp- <dig>  which in turn negatively regulates protective immune processes. this pathway represents a new branch of intestinal innate immune signaling.
