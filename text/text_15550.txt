BACKGROUND
the ability of plants to survive freezing temperatures depends on their capacity to cold acclimate, that is, to prepare for freezing temperatures during exposition to low, but non-freezing, temperatures  <cit> . during this period of cold acclimation, a number of biochemical and physiological changes takes place that include modification of the lipid composition of membranes and an increase in total soluble protein and other molecules, such as sugars and proline, thought to serve as cryoprotectants . as a consequence, plants from temperate regions can survive freezing at temperatures ranging from -5°c to -30°c, depending on the species. non-acclimated wheat, for instance, is killed at freezing temperatures around -5°c but following cold acclimation is able to survive temperatures down to -20°c  <cit> . in contrast, most plants from tropical regions, for example tomato and maize, are unable to acclimate and to survive freezing.

cold acclimation is associated with large modifications of gene expression  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a central pathway includes the cbf/dreb <dig>  genes. it is estimated that 12–20% of cold-induced transcriptional changes are accounted for by cbf1- <dig>  <cit> . these ap2/erf type transcription factors are rapidly induced in response to cold and reach a peak of expression after  <dig> to  <dig> h of exposure to cold  <cit> . the cbf proteins in turn activate expression of a set of target effector genes by binding to a core sequence in their promoter, alternatively called the c-repeat , the dehydration-responsive element  or the low temperature response element , that is involved in cold responsiveness  <cit> . genes containing this motif are known as cor , rd  responsive to dehydration), kin  or lti  genes, and are collectively referred to as the "cbf regulon".

cbf genes appear to be ubiquitous in plant species and are almost always present as a gene family . in arabidopsis, there are four characterized cbf genes: cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  located in tandem on chromosome  <dig>  are cold induced, while cbf <dig> is reported to be involved in drought tolerance  <cit> . homologues have been described in many species including wheat, rye, and brassica napus, all of which can acclimate, and even in tomato, which is chilling-sensitive  <cit> . some species have large cbf gene families, for example barley, which has at least  <dig> family members  <cit> . cbf homologues are also present in tree species including poplar  <cit>  and eucalyptus  <cit> . not all these homologous genes are cold inducible. tomato, for example, has three cbf genes but just one is cold inducible; moreover, tomato exhibits a reduced cbf regulon, which may contribute to its freezing sensitivity  <cit> .

in addition to their ubiquitous presence in plants, major qtl for freezing tolerance have been identified in both arabidopsis  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  that localize to the region of the cbf genes. moreover, it has been found that over-expression of any individual arabidopsis cbf gene leads to constitutive expression of cbf regulon genes and an increase in freezing tolerance without cold exposure  <cit> . the cbf genes thus seem to play a critical role in cold acclimation leading to freezing tolerance. it is unclear, however, to what extent the three arabidopsis cbf genes have redundant roles. the same target genes are induced following over-expression of each cbf, leading to the conclusion that the cbf genes are functionally redundant  <cit> . on the other hand, there is evidence that cbf <dig> has a regulatory role. in the only cbf mutant described to date  <cit> , there is a t-dna insertion in the putative tata box upstream of the cbf <dig> gene which leads to plants that are more freezing tolerant in the non-acclimated and the acclimated state, indicating that cbf <dig> is a negative regulator of freezing tolerance. this is supported by rnai and anti-sense lines that indicate that cbf <dig> differs in function from cbf <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the lack of characterized mutants has so far precluded analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes for the cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> genes.

the study of natural genetic variation has proven to be an alternative means to elucidate the functional role of candidate genes in a given process . previously, a core collection of  <dig> arabidopsis thaliana accessions was generated that maximizes genetic variation in this species  <cit> . further, it is known that arabidopsis plants of different geographic provenance differ in their ability to cold acclimate  <cit> . thus, it could be expected that naturally-occurring phenotypic variation in freezing tolerance could be related to polymorphisms present in the cbf genes and their promoter regions, and that in particular the inability to withstand freezing might be traced back to deleterious polymorphisms in these genes. we therefore chose to characterize the polymorphism present in the cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes and their promoters in the versailles arabidopsis core collection. polymorphism in the cbf genes could exert an effect at two different levels: in the expression of the cbf genes themselves, via polymorphism in the respective promoters, or in the expression of the downstream effector genes  via polymorphism in the cbf coding regions. a set of eight accessions was chosen to perform a detailed analysis of individual cbf and cor gene expression during acclimation, using quantitative pcr . finally, freezing tolerance phenotype was determined in the entire core collection and the lt <dig> was determined from electrolyte leakage measurements in the eight accessions to better understand the relation between cbf gene polymorphism, cbf and cor gene expression and acclimated freezing tolerance.

RESULTS
sequencing of the cbf genes in the arabidopsis core collection
we surveyed the sequence diversity of the cbf genes to understand their role in gene expression variation, but also to determine if these genes exhibit atypical patterns of polymorphism that are suggestive of recent selection. the entire coding regions of the cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes as well as 1200– <dig> bp upstream of the atg were sequenced in the  <dig> accessions of the versailles core collection. we additionally sequenced the accessions ws and col- <dig>  used as genetic background for many mutant lines and for over-expression lines of cbf genes  <cit> . table  <dig> summarizes the sequencing results. all three genes were found to be highly polymorphic, particularly in their promoters, with cbf <dig> the most and cbf <dig> the least polymorphic gene. this ranking was consistent between promoters and coding regions. in the coding regions, a number of non-synonymous amino acid changes were found, as described in detail below.

"snp ns" refers to the number of non-synonymous amino acid changes

additional file  <dig> summarizes the polymorphism data for the three genes. tajima's d statistic was used to evaluate the allele frequency spectrum and quantify the excess of rare alleles . two observations could be suggestive of a recent selective sweep in cbf2: a lower amount of polymorphism relative to the other genes and more negative and significantly lower values of tajima's d . however,  a large scale survey of nucleotide sequence variation in a. thaliana shows that the average distribution of tajima's d in the genome is biased towards negative values  <cit> ,  sequencing of  <dig> fragments to generate the core collection also yielded negative tajima's d  <cit> . therefore, negative values of d cannot be explained unambiguously by selection rather than by demographic processes . last, levels of selective constraints on the segregating amino acid polymorphism, as measured by the ratio πns/πs, was fairly constant across the three genes  despite a tenfold variation in π. this ratio was highest in the coding region of cbf <dig> but only slightly higher than in the coding region of cbf <dig> 

cbf gene promoter region polymorphism
in the promoter regions, a number of insertions and deletions were found, and the accession cvi- <dig>  was distinguished by a deletion of  <dig>  kb in the cbf <dig> promoter ending at position - <dig> . an  microsatellite was found in the promoter of cbf <dig> . although few functional studies of the cbf gene promoters have been undertaken, one region defining the motifs icer <dig> and icer <dig> has been shown to be critical to cbf <dig> gene expression, while several myc sites are located in the cbf <dig> promoter and one, located at - <dig> to - <dig> , seems critical for ice <dig> binding to the cbf <dig> promoter  <cit> . a number of conserved sequences between the cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> gene promoters have also been identified and are known as boxes i-vi  <cit> . further, a number of myb recognition sequences in the promoters are postulated to play a role in the binding of myb <dig> to the cbf promoters  <cit> . all these regions are postulated to be important for the  regulation of the three cbf genes.

we also examined individual cbf promoters using the database of orthologous promoters  which searches for common motifs in orthologous promoters. a number of motifs were identified in each of the three genes, as shown in additional file  <dig>  these motifs, conserved among several species, are thought to play a regulatory role. as seen in additional file  <dig>  some of these motifs lie within the six "cbf boxes" cited above.

freezing tolerance phenotype of the investigated accessions
freezing tolerance was evaluated in the entire arabidopsis thaliana versailles core collection of  <dig> accessions, as well as ws  and col- <dig> , by acclimating plants for  <dig> days at 5°c followed by  <dig> h freezing at -5°c. recovery of the plants was noted at  <dig> and  <dig> days after thawing . as expected  <cit> , cvi- <dig>  and can- <dig>  were among the most sensitive accessions, while ws  and rld- <dig>  showed the expected high degree of freezing tolerance  <cit> . col- <dig> , on the other hand, showed unexpectedly extensive damage under these conditions .

accessions were grown as described in the methods, acclimated for  <dig> days at 5°c, and then exposed to -5°c for  <dig> hours. notes were given as described after  <dig> days and  <dig> days of recovery. accessions are sorted from freezing tolerant to freezing sensitive at day  <dig> . the accessions col- <dig> and ws, which are not in the core collection, were also included. freezing tolerant cold core accessions are in bold and freezing sensitive in italics for lt <dig> measurements, see methods.

for comparison with the whole plant survival assay, eight accessions were additionally used for electrolyte leakage measurements. among the sensitive accessions, we chose cvi- <dig> , ita- <dig> , can- <dig>  and sah- <dig> , among the intermediate ones, col- <dig> , and among the tolerant accessions, ws , rld- <dig> , and rub- <dig> . in these experiments,  <dig> day old plants were acclimated for  <dig> days at 4°c. detached mature leaves were frozen and thawed under highly controlled conditions and lt <dig> values  were calculated . the results , were consistent with the whole plant survival assay, except for col- <dig> , which showed greater freezing tolerance in the electrolyte leakage assay. so finally the eight accessions fall into two contrasting groups with respect to their freezing tolerance, a tolerant and a sensitive one . for brevity, we call these eight accessions the "cold core" in the remainder of the paper.

cold induced cbf gene expression
as a direct evaluation of the effect of polymorphism in the cbf promoters, we examined expression of the cbf genes in response to low temperature. since it was not possible to study expression in all accessions, we chose the above described "cold core" for detailed analysis. sequencing revealed that the eight accessions of the cold core differ in genotype .

for this cold core, we first performed a detailed analysis of cbf promoter regions thought to be functionally important . for cbf <dig>  two polymorphisms are present in the conserved boxes, which are also present in a number of accessions outside the cold core. on the other hand, the sensitive accessions sah- <dig>  and ita- <dig>  contain a polymorphic region between boxes ii and iii that includes a stretch of 16– <dig> "a" that prevent sequencing in the 3'-> 5' direction. in the 5'-3' orientation, a sequence was found that showed no significant homology to sequences from arabidopsis or any other species by blast searches. analysis by gel electrophoresis indicated that these promoters have an insertion that is estimated to be around  <dig> bp long. for the cbf <dig> promoter, no polymorphism was found in the conserved boxes, except for cvi- <dig> , which has a deletion covering boxes i-iv and thus the icer <dig> region. in cbf <dig>  four polymorphisms were detected in the region of the conserved boxes, with one,  only present in the sensitive accession sah- <dig> . in the myc sites, three polymorphisms were identified. the tolerant accession rub- <dig>  had polymorphisms in the myc <dig> and myc <dig> sites, which were shared with three other accessions. an additional polymorphism was found in the myc <dig> site that was present in three of the sensitive accessions as well as in four other accessions. in the myb recognition sequences that showed medium or strong binding to myb <dig>  <cit> , the only significant polymorphism is present in cvi- <dig> , which lacks all four recognition sequences . in the motifs identified by doop, there was little polymorphism even among all  <dig> accessions . among the cold core, one polymorphism was found in motif  <dig> of the cbf <dig> promoter in ita- <dig> .

we also examined the occurrence of rare snps in the three cbf promoters in the cold core. of  <dig> singletons  in the cbf <dig> promoter, seven were found in the four sensitive accessions. in cbf <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> singletons were in these accessions and in cbf <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig>  no singletons were present in the four freezing tolerant accessions of the cold core.

we examined the kinetics of cbf expression in these eight accessions, focusing on the first  <dig> h of acclimation, when maximum cbf expression has been observed  <cit> . fig.  <dig> provides a detailed analysis of cbf expression over the first eight hours compared to the expression of the cor gene, cor15a. fig.  <dig> presents a second experiment and shows cbf expression over  <dig> hours. the same general trends were seen when comparing biological replicates and the different q-pcr platforms used . all three cbf genes were expressed in all accessions, although not at the same level. a peak of cbf expression occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> h following transfer to the cold and then returned to low levels, by  <dig> h, which were, however, still clearly above the levels detected in nonacclimated plants . in all accessions cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found to be coordinately regulated .

highest cbf expression consistently occurred in the tolerant accessions rub- <dig>  and ws . surprisingly, the other accessions all showed quite comparable expression levels, except for cvi- <dig> , where cbf <dig> expression was always very low . rld- <dig> , which showed high freezing tolerance , showed variable expression of all three cbf genes. in fig.  <dig>  cbf expression in this accession was low, while in fig.  <dig> expression was intermediate between that of rub- <dig>  and ws  and the sensitive accessions. expression in col- <dig>  was initially low, but showed a peak around  <dig> h for all three genes . in the second experiment , no data was collected at  <dig> h, thus expression appears overall to be low. the differences between the experiments in the spacing and number of time points analyzed may also explain other differences in the results, such as the maximum levels of expression observed for a given gene. in addition, it highlights the difficulty of analyzing expression kinetics since small time differences may lead to significant differences in expression level. ita- <dig>  showed expression levels similar to col- <dig>  although about half an hour earlier . interestingly, cbf <dig> expression in sah- <dig>  was much lower at the earliest time points than in ita- <dig>  , although they both have an insertion in their promoters. cbf <dig> expression was present in cvi- <dig>  despite the large promoter deletion, albeit at very low levels. in these experiments, cbf <dig> was not expressed later than cbf <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast to a previous report  <cit> . the length of the microsatellite in the promoter of cbf <dig> had no obvious effect on expression .

an unexpected finding was that cbf gene expression occurred with multiple peaks . this was seen in two independent experiments  and to a different extent depending on the accession. thus, ws  had expression peaks at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, while col- <dig>  showed a small peak at  <dig> min and a larger peak at  <dig> h. to rule out that there were differences in cbf expression between accessions at later time points, two experiments were performed in which plants were acclimated for  <dig> weeks and expression determined at weekly intervals. as previously reported  <cit>  cbf expression remained low following the initial peak, and no detectable differences between accessions were observed .

cbf coding region polymorphism and cor gene expression
the predicted amino acid changes in the cbf proteins of all  <dig> sequenced accessions are shown in fig.  <dig>  the majority are rare: 19/ <dig> are singletons and an additional 10/ <dig> are present at a frequency of less than 10% . among the non-synonymous changes, a number are predicted to have an effect on protein structure  <cit> . notably, one accession has a  <dig> amino acid deletion at the c-terminal end of cbf <dig> , another a stop codon at position  <dig> of the cbf <dig> protein  and one  has a g->r replacement which could affect protein structure in the ap <dig> motif of cbf <dig>  these are indicated in red in fig.  <dig>  for the eight cold core accessions, no amino acid changes were found in the nls region or in the cbf "signature sequences" which surround the ap <dig> domain  <cit> . however, there were some amino acid changes that are predicted to alter protein structure or to affect the hydrophobic domains that are involved in trans-activation . in the tolerant accessions there were only two predicted amino acid changes in cbf <dig>  two of which are predicted to affect protein structure. they fall into a region between two hydrophobic clusters, described in  <cit>  as important for transactivation. the first, e-> a affects rld- <dig> , but also two other accessions which are not in the cold core. the second, l->p, affects rub- <dig>  and also other accessions outside the cold core, which show intermediate tolerance.

in the four freezing sensitive accessions, the cbf proteins are more polymorphic. of the  <dig> singleton polymorphisms affecting amino acids, nine are found in the four freezing sensitive accessions of the cold core. moreover, a number of amino acid substitutions are predicted to have an effect on protein structure and are unique to sensitive accessions . in none of the four sensitive accessions, however, are all three cbf genes subject to polymorphism that is predicted to cause changes in protein structure.

in order to investigate whether the polymorphism in the coding sequences of the cbf genes has a general effect on the expression of the target cor genes, five cor genes  were chosen for analysis . the kinetics of cor gene expression differed from that of the cbf genes  as has been described previously  <cit> . expression increased after less than  <dig> h in the cold and this continued up to  <dig> h. cold induction was observed for all cor genes in all accessions. the freezing tolerant accession rub- <dig>  generally showed the highest level of cor gene expression. expression of the cor genes in the sensitive accessions was often lower than in the tolerant accessions, but this was not always the case and col- <dig>  had cor gene expression levels similar to the sensitive accessions. over a five week period, expression of cor15b stayed at a steady level but expression of cor <dig> decreased after  <dig> h in all accessions tested .

discussion
qtl mapping and over-expression studies have demonstrated the importance of the cbf genes in cold acclimation. moreover, cold-inducible cbf genes appear to be ubiquitous in plants. to further explore the mechanism by which the cbf genes enhance freezing tolerance, we analyzed the relationship between polymorphism in these genes and their expression as well as the expression of their target cor genes. finally, the relation between gene expression and phenotypic variation in arabidopsis accessions with different geographic origins was evaluated. the study of naturally-occurring genetic variation provides a means of analyzing gene function without inducing pleiotropic effects that are often observed when transcription factors are ectopically expressed. in the case of arabidopsis plants constitutively overexpressing cbf genes, such pleiotropic effects were clearly evident, as the transgenic plants showed a dwarf phenotype with severely reduced growth  <cit> . we therefore undertook to characterize the arabidopsis core collection with respect to polymorphism present in the cbf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes and their promoters. the cbf genes were found to be highly polymorphic, both in their promoters and coding regions. in addition, we could show that there is large phenotypic variability with respect to freezing tolerance in this collection of accessions. on the basis of our phenotyping experiments, eight accessions which can be divided into a "freezing tolerant" and a "freezing sensitive" group were chosen for detailed expression studies over the first  <dig> h of cold acclimation. unlike most previous studies, we used quantitative q-pcr to provide a sensitive measure of gene expression. to assess the effects of promoter polymorphism, we used cbf gene expression as the primary phenotype, while cor gene expression was chosen as the primary phenotype for polymorphism in the cbf coding regions.

the three cbf genes were found to be expressed in all accessions, even the most freezing sensitive, despite a high degree of polymorphism in their promoters. cbf <dig> was expressed in cvi- <dig> , which lacks a large portion of the cbf <dig> promoter and which previously had been reported on the basis of northern blot results to lack cbf <dig> expression  <cit> . using highly sensitive q-pcr, we found that in cvi- <dig>  the cbf <dig> gene is induced by cold, albeit at low levels. it has been reported that the sequences between - <dig> and - <dig>  may be sufficient to impart cold-responsive expression  <cit> . since this region is intact in cvi- <dig> , the effect of the deletion appears to be on the strength of the cold responsiveness. the cbf <dig> mutant in the col- <dig> background described by novillo et al.  <cit>  completely lacks cbf <dig> expression whereas cvi- <dig>  retains low levels of cbf <dig> expression. this difference in cbf <dig> expression may also explain the different phenotypes between the mutant and cvi- <dig>  as cvi- <dig> shows very low freezing tolerance, while the mutant in contrast showed increased freezing tolerance compared to wild type col- <dig> plants. this has been related to the fact that cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> were expressed at higher levels in the cold in the mutant than in the wild type. since an appropriate "wild type control" is not available for cvi- <dig>  the question whether the low expression of cbf <dig> influences the expression levels of the other cbf genes can not be answered.

interestingly, the freezing sensitive accessions sah- <dig>  and ita- <dig>  both have insertions in their cbf <dig> promoters. the insertions appear to be identical, and no homology was found to other arabidopsis sequences. nonetheless, these accessions have different patterns of cbf <dig> expression . the difference in expression is presumed to be unrelated to the insertions since a number of polymorphisms exist between these two accessions in the cbf <dig> promoter.

next, we explored the polymorphism in the cbf genes and its effect on cor gene expression. in the coding region, a number of amino acid changes with possible functional effects were identified in the sensitive accessions. it could be possible that, like in the case of the sfr <dig> gene, a single mutation can give rise to a freezing sensitive phenotype  <cit> . to evaluate the effect of polymorphisms, we examined expression of part of the cbf regulon, which can be considered a direct phenotype of variation in cbf genes. the five cor genes contain the consensus dre element, to which the cbf proteins have been shown to bind and are therefore direct targets of the cbf proteins. all five cor genes were expressed in all accessions, but again, sensitive accessions generally had lower cor gene expressions levels, except for ita- <dig>  . since the cbf regulon is largely coordinately regulated, this expression pattern indicates that the response is at least partially intact even in the sensitive accessions. this is in agreement with the result that cbf genes are also all expressed in every accession. in no case were potentially damaging snps found in all three genes in the same accession. moreover, since there are three cbf genes, a single mutation may not have an effect, due to functional redundancy. nonetheless, either small differences in cbf expression could contribute to an overall smaller amount of cor gene expression or a smaller portion of the cbf regulon may be expressed. it has been reported that the overall magnitude of the cbf regulon response is important in determining freezing tolerance in arabidopsis  <cit>  and that the cbf regulon is smaller in tomato, which is freezing sensitive  <cit> .

in general, the most freezing tolerant accessions have the highest levels of cbf and cor gene expression and the most sensitive have lower expression levels. with the small number of accessions studied with respect to gene expression, it is difficult to confirm that there is a direct correlation between these parameters or to pinpoint the effect of specific polymorphisms on gene expression. in the future, larger gene expression studies using whole genome microarrays and a larger number of accessions would make it possible to evaluate the effect of individual snps and to confirm that a given haplotype corresponds to a specific expression pattern. for example, the cbf <dig> and cbf <dig> promoters of ws are in the same haplotype as accessions pi- <dig> , mt- <dig>  and ct- <dig> . we would therefore predict similar expression patterns for the two genes in these accessions. although there are no common polymorphisms in the cbf genes and their promoters that are unique to the sensitive accessions, a number of low frequency polymorphisms that may affect cbf and/or cor gene expression are found. in the sensitive accessions, there is an accumulation of rare polymorphisms in the coding regions, giving rise to a number of amino acid changes. these independent amino acid changes may reflect a relaxation of purifying selection: cold sensitivity may not be counter-selected in regions with no or very rare freezing events. in agreement with this hypothesis, it has been shown recently that the acclimated freezing tolerance of different arabidopsis accessions is linearly correlated with minimum habitat temperatures  <cit> .

given this correlation, we analyzed the relationship between gene expression and freezing tolerance phenotype. we chose a phenotyping protocol similar to zhen and ungerer  <cit>  that assesses plant survival after freezing and not cellular damage in a specific tissue, such as leaves, to discriminate between accessions. this test also takes into account the progress during the recovery period, with some accessions maintaining a steady condition, and others tending to show more or less damage over time. this highlights the difficulty of phenotyping for freezing tolerance: depending on the time after freezing, the damage may vary. therefore, the phenotyping we used was based on the amount of damage after eight days of recovery. as reflected by mean scores that tend to become lower, the majority of the accessions tested showed some damage following freezing, but were able to recover. this suggests that most arabidopsis accessions can withstand mild freezing conditions  and that highly sensitive accessions  are rare.

in addition, the eight accessions used for detailed expression studies were also phenotyped using electrolyte leakage assays with mature leaves as another well-established method to determine freezing tolerance. with the exception of col- <dig>  which showed higher freezing tolerance with the electrolyte leakage than with the plant survival assay, both methods were in close agreement. the reason for the discrepancy with col- <dig> has not been established yet. however, since the electrolyte leakage data reported here are in agreement with several previous studies from different laboratories , we treated col- <dig> as a freezing tolerant accession in all subsequent analyses.

among the most freezing sensitive accessions, can- <dig> , cvi- <dig> , dijon- <dig>  and sah- <dig>  belong to the west mediterranean group, defined by studying patterns of polymorphism in a set of  <dig> european accessions  <cit> . this group contains very sensitive accessions and also contains accessions with the most southern origin and consequently with the highest minimum habitat temperatures, posing the least threat of freezing.

the lack of a clear correlation between cbf and cor gene expression and freezing tolerance phenotype might have several explanations. it is known that other pathways besides the cbf pathway are involved in cold acclimation  <cit>  and that there are complex interactions between different components involved in freezing tolerance. at this time, it is difficult to predict how these interactions may affect cbf and cor gene expression and ultimate freezing tolerance. nonetheless, qtl mapping in a cross between cvi and ler  <cit>  supports a role for the cbfs in natural variation in this response. additional support for the role of the cbf genes comes from hannah et al.  <cit>  who found a correlation between cbf <dig> and  <dig> expression and freezing tolerance in different accessions after  <dig> days of acclimation. in this study, plants were significantly older when acclimation occurred  than in our study and plants were acclimated for  <dig> days as opposed to  <dig>  thus the conditions studied are not directly comparable. we and others  <cit>  have already shown that the genotype as well as the length and temperature of acclimation affect freezing tolerance.

an important factor to consider when studying the cbf genes is their tandemly duplicated nature. duplication is considered a major source for the generation of evolutionary novelty, through processes such as neo-functionalization and sub-functionalization  <cit> . other fates for paralogous genes include the evolution of one copy into a nonfunctional pseudogene or the functional preservation of copies to increase the robustness of the genetic network  <cit> . it would appear that the latter is the case for the cbf genes. since these genes are duplicated in many species and show nearly identical expression profiles, it seems likely that multiple copies are required to ensure an essential function. the fact that polymorphisms that might influence protein structure and function never occurred in all three cbf genes in any accession and that more polymorphisms were found in the coding regions of cbf genes from sensitive than from tolerant accessions also point in this direction. in addition, while cbf genes clearly play a role in tolerance to abiotic stress, other, as yet unknown, functions for these genes seem likely, given that they are expressed differentially in seeds, pollen, embryos and roots in arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, it is possible that, in other tissues, there may be a specialization of individual cbf gene functions.

this raises the question of the whether there is complete functional redundancy of individual cbf genes in freezing tolerance. it has been suggested that cbf <dig> is a negative regulator of cbf <dig> and cbf <dig>  <cit> . our expression data did not allow us to further confirm this possibility nor to distinguish functional differences in the three genes. instead, as previously reported, the three cbf genes showed nearly identical temporal expression patterns, regardless of their polymorphisms. another means of exploring the functional redundancy of the cbf genes is to look at the nucleotide variation. the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous amino acid changes gives a measure of selective constraints on the segregating amino acid polymorphism. if a gene is highly constrained by purifying selection  then one expects πns << πs. this ratio is fairly constant among the three genes despite marked variation in π. this indicates that all three genes are roughly equally important functionally and, furthermore, that their function confers similar constraint over the amino acid sequence. it is possible however, that sub-functionalization of these duplicates has occurred, e.g. by tissue-specific expression, induction by different signals, or activation of different cor genes, making all of them necessary to ensure maximal cold acclimation. on the other hand, this apparent redundancy complicates the search for mutants and, as seen here, their study by the exploitation of natural variation. rnai studies targeting individual or combinations of cbf genes  <cit>  are currently underway and will help resolve these problems.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that the versailles core collection contains significant variation with respect to freezing tolerance at the level of phenotype, polymorphism in the cbf genes and cbf and cor gene expression. although there tends to be more cbf and cor gene expression in tolerant accessions, there is no simple correlation between these factors, undoubtedly due partly to the redundancy of the three genes and the number of genes and their complex interactions in the cold response gene network. the availability of the cbf sequences in  <dig> accessions will allow future detailed studies to relate cbf gene polymorphism to gene expression and metabolite networks and freezing tolerance and other low temperature survival phenotypes.
