BACKGROUND
while current methods uncover ever greater quantities of copy number variants  relevant to complex phenotypes and using increasingly sophisticated sample designs, challenges persist in accurate and sensitive detection and confirmation of cnv calls. in humans, the study of cnv associations with complex phenotypes is in high demand with a rich diversity of cost-effective methods  <cit> ; challenges in experimental design lie in the limited availability of relevant tissue samples. the opposite situation exists for cnv analyses in mice, where biological samples are not limiting, but high-throughput technologies lack resolution and variety. also, bioinformatic resources like genomic annotations are more limited and software are not always useable out of the box with mouse data.

studies of cnvs in mice have relied on two main approaches. the first, array comparative genomic hybridization , reports relative copy number to a reference  . these studies established the extent of copy number variation in the mouse and impact of cnvs on differential expression and phenotypic variation. taken together, they have characterized around  <dig> strains of mice, as well as wild-caught mice. the second approach is next-generation sequencing  , which allows for much higher resolution and accuracy, as well as the ability to further characterize the mechanisms and structural variants  resulting in cnv events. ngs also has the sensitivity to detect svs, that are not detectable by array-based methods, such as inversions, novel insertions, small insertions, small deletions and complex indel mutations. while ngs is the method of choice for modern structural variant analysis, it still remains prohibitively expensive for many projects, but has been completed for  <dig> strains  <cit> .

for studying the human genome, high-density single nucleotide polymorphism  microarrays have become a common platform for cnv analysis and were used as part of the hapmap project  <cit> . large-scale studies have also used snp microarrays for dog, swine and cow . in contrast to acgh, originally the snp microarray’s primary purpose was for genotyping, with probe sets designed to distinguish the genotype at sites of known polymorphism. the arrays may also include probe sets designed for sites where there is no known snp variation, called copy number  probes or invariant genomic probes . taken together, the snp and igp probe sets can be used with various available algorithms  <cit>  to identify putative cnv calls.

the affymetrix® mouse diversity genotyping array  is the most dense snp array currently available and also includes igps relevant to cnv analysis  <cit> . the mdga has been used to characterize and map the subspecific origin  and haplotype diversity of snps for  <dig> samples including wild-caught mice, wild-derived laboratory strains and classical laboratory strains  <cit> . many of the wild-derived strains, thought to be faithful representatives of related wild-caught mice, showed introgression. classical laboratory strains were derived mostly from m. m. domesticus, with the other main contributor being m. m. molossinus. snp probe sets on the array were identified where unknown genetic variation affected probe set performance, termed variable intensity oligonucleotides . vinos may represent off-target variation in the genome near the snp queried by a probe set and show a consistent, low-intensity cluster during genotyping. didion et al. extended the work using  <dig> mouse samples and showed that inclusion of vinos in analysis reduces ascertainment bias as well as improves accuracy of the results  <cit> . using the mdga, introgression was also shown across subspecies boundaries in natural populations of m. m. domesticus and m. m. musculus  <cit> . this introgression was shown to affect more than 10 % of the genome, and showed evidence of positive selection. the mdga has also been used to characterize copy number alterations  in tumourigenesis, where incremental accumulation of cnas was seen during tumour development  <cit> . however, the mdga has yet to be applied to a large population of mice for cnv characterization.

here, we report cnv analysis of  <dig> mice using the mdga and analyzed with penncnv software, representing  <dig> strains that have not been studied for cnvs previously. we compare these putative cnvs to those found by both ngs and acgh studies, identify and analyze recurrent cnv regions and characterize the genes and pathways affected by putative cnv regions. cn confirmation in three commonly used classical laboratory strains was performed using droplet digital pcr . nine genic copy number variable regions  that differ in copy number between classical inbred strains were selected for cnv confirmation in five c57bl/6 j, five cba/caj and four dba/2 j mice. furthermore, we compare the cnv distance to the snp distance between the mouse genomics institute  priority strains and discuss the mdga and its use in cnv studies.

RESULTS
cnvs detected
using ~ <dig>  million probes, filtered from the affymetrix® mouse diversity genotyping array , we analyzed cnv content in a diverse set of  <dig> publically available array intensity cel files  <cit> . probe sets were filtered to reduce possible sources of noise and false positives in cnv detection . snp and igp probe sets targeting  <dig>  unique loci , have an inter-probe-set median distance of 319 bp. cnvs were identified using penncnv software separately for autosomes and the x chromosome. cnvs were filtered to include calls between 500 bp to 1 mb, having a minimum probe density of approximately one probe per 7700 bp. for samples to be included in the main analysis, their data must have passed two quality control criteria for the autosomes; small log-r ratio standard deviation  and low drift in b-allele frequency . all data are provided as a resource to researchers in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

for  <dig> samples passing quality control criteria, a total of  <dig> cnvs were identified on the autosomes, with an average of  <dig>  calls per sample . on the x chromosome,  <dig> cnvs were found , with an average of  <dig>  calls per sample. calls across all samples affect  <dig>  %  of the autosomal genome or  <dig>  %  when including calls on the x chromosome. studies have found between  <dig>  %  <cit>  and  <dig>  %  <cit>  of the reference genome affected by svs and cnvs respectively. the percent of the genome affected was higher for wild-derived mouse samples at  <dig>  %  <cit> , and in a study including wild-caught samples at  <dig>  %  <cit> . these values are all affected by the sample size, capture technology and diversity of samples, which differs between studies. the amount of the mouse genome affected by cnvs is greater than that reported for dog   <cit> , cattle   <cit>  and swine   <cit>  but is similar to that reported for humans  .table  <dig> number of cnv calls on the autosomes by mouse classification and copy number state

a copy number  <dig> is a full deletion, or no copies, then  <dig> copy, then  <dig> or more copies respectively


b deletion/amplification is the total number of deletions  divided by the number of amplifications 



strains classified as classical laboratory strains have a mean of  <dig>  %  of the autosomes affected by cnvs,  <dig>  %  when the x chromosome was included. the mean autosome and genome percentage affected for the wild-derived laboratory strains  and wild-caught mice  were significantly different than the classical laboratory strains .

the cnvs on the autosomes have an average length of  <dig>  bp, with a median length of  <dig>  bp. the majority  of cnv calls are between 1 kb and 100 kb . amplifications are significantly larger than deletions , where amplifications have a median length of  <dig>  bp compared to deletions at  <dig>  bp. copy-state-zero deletions are significantly smaller than copy-state-one deletions , where copy-state-zero deletions have a median length of  <dig>  bp compared to copy-state-one deletions at  <dig>  bp. deletions outnumber amplifications by a ratio of  <dig> : <dig> on the autosomes , which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .fig.  <dig> cnv call summary. sankey diagram depicting cnv calls on the autosomes classified into unique categories stacked vertically for length, type, mouse strain type, uniqueness and gene content from left to right. flows between vertical categories  are proportional to the number of calls sharing both horizontally neighboring classifications. for example, almost half of the “100 + kb” classified cnv calls are also “amplifications”



concordance with previous studies
we performed strain-matched comparisons of our calls with those found with next generation sequencing methods by the sanger mouse genome project  with a relatively stringent overlap criterion of 20 % reciprocal overlap, as well as a more relaxed criterion of single base pair overlap and found concordance ranging from 0 % -  <dig>  %, with a median concordance of  <dig>  % . the lowest concordance was found in the c57bl/6nj mice, the highest in the nzo/hiltj . low concordance in c57bl/6nj is not unexpected, as we found few cnv calls in this strain , as well as few reported variants in the sanger data . calls that overlapped known sv from the sanger data tended to be longer than those not found . the copy-number state of the call also affected how often overlap was observed, with copy-state  <dig> least often being found to overlap any calls in the sanger data, and copy-state  <dig> most often found to overlap calls . the percentage of calls which overlapped sanger data, that were found across our samples multiple times  was  <dig> , while the percentage of calls that did not overlap which were “recurrent” was lower at  <dig>  this could indicate that there are more false positives in the copy-state  <dig> calls, and that calls are more likely to be observed in ngs studies if they are found in multiple samples.

strain-matched comparison to the sanger ngs data is somewhat limited, as the data include many call types that cannot be assessed with microarray analysis . the types we did see overlap were tandem duplication , duplication , nested deletion  and deletions . additionally, our results are not reported in relation to c57bl/6 j , but as relative to a diploid reference generated from all strains. this could lead to differences in strain-attribution of cnvs, and confound strain-matched comparison.

we also compared our calls to previous studies , without matching strains. the higher overlap percentage criterion ensures our cnv calls are not considered the same as small insertion and small deletion events , which are reported by ngs studies as svs. a total of  <dig> of our called regions have been seen previously in other studies,  <dig> when including single base-pair overlap . comparisons across array-based technologies are known to have low rates of concordance  <cit> . it is known that both the false positive and false negative rates are high for both acgh and ngs  <cit> . the false positive rate for our cnv detection method is estimated to be between 15 %–25 %. additionally, ngs studies to date have surveyed only  <dig> distinct mouse strains, which does not represent the diversity captured here. increasing evidence for cnvs contributing to somatic mosaicism in human and mouse  <cit>  is also consistent with discordance, as the tissue chosen differed.

another type of sv is that of mouse gene retrocopy insertion polymorphisms , which are retrotranspositions of processed mrna transcripts, causing a copy of the source gene to be inserted  in one or more individuals, but absent from the reference genome  <cit> . the mdga has only  <dig> probes that directly query grips of the known  <dig> grip positions. nevertheless,  <dig> of our cnv calls overlapped grip positions by at least 1 bp, representing  <dig> reported grips from the autosomal reference genome. when considering instead, the  <dig> unique source genes of these grips on the autosomes ,  <dig> of our calls overlapped with  <dig> of the grip source genes. only  <dig> of these source genes correspond to a gene in the set of  <dig> found using the insertion site. further study at higher sensitivity would be required to validate if these  <dig> cnv calls found by insertion site or source gene cnv are indeed grips, or cnvs that span the same insertion sites or source genes.

recurrent cnv regions detected
recurrence can arise from common inheritance or hotspots of mutation  <cit> . we identified recurrent cnv events between samples as events with at least 40 % reciprocal overlap using hdcnv  <cit> . there are more recurrent events than unique events , but unique events affect more of the genome  than recurrent events . recurrent events contain proportionately more genes than unique events . there are  <dig> different regions containing recurrent cnv events, with a median of  <dig> events per region and  <dig> of these regions contain  <dig> or more recurrent cnv events.table  <dig> number of unique or recurrent cnv calls on the autosomes by mouse classification

uniqueness and recurrence  are both consistently based on the entire analysis and are not reevaluated within mouse classification types , i.e. a call being unique in the wild-caught group was not found to overlap with any other call in the entire analysis and is not only unique within the samples classified as wild caught. in brackets, the call count is normalized by sample size


aa call is considered recurrent if it has 40 % reciprocal overlap with any other call



in fig.  <dig>  the relative number of calls per chromosome, as well as the degree of recurrence on each chromosome is shown, while fig.  <dig> shows the locations and composition of recurrent events. the number of events per chromosome is not correlated to chromosome length, and the degree of recurrence varies between chromosomes. the copy number state of events within recurrent regions can be a mixture of amplifications and deletions .fig.  <dig> number and recurrence of cnv calls. each cnv call is represented as a single dot within larger circular clusters, with each cluster representing the autosomes 1– <dig>  then 6– <dig> and so on. calls with at least 40 % reciprocal overlap are joined by a line and considered recurrent. each dot is then coloured on a heatmap scale, based on how many overlaps that call has with other calls on the same chromosome. the heat map colours range from  <dig> overlaps  to  <dig> overlaps . the total size of each chromosomal cluster is proportionate to the number of events found on that chromosome. larger collections of connected dots represent cnv calls that are found in many samples, while unconnected dots represent unique events not shared among any samples. labels a through d indicate complex clusters

fig.  <dig> copy number variants identified. for each chromosome both unique calls and recurrent regions are plotted. the unique calls are plotted for each chromosome as follows : copy number amplification calls for three or more copies are plotted in dark blue above the region of the chromosome where they are found, the chromosome line in black, followed by one copy deletions in light red and full deletions in dark red below the chromosome line. the regions of recurrent cnv calls are plotted directly on the black chromosome line. here, if the overlapping calls were all deletions, they are plotted in red; if they were all amplifications they are plotted in blue; if they are a mix of amplifications and deletions they are plotted in green



the proportion of unique events seen in wild-caught mice is higher than any other classification subgroup . the high percentage of cnv-affected genome in our analysis  relative to other studies is likely due to the inclusion of wild-derived and wild-caught samples because these subgroups have more calls that are unique . classical laboratory strains and crosses with these strains, including the bxd strains   <cit> , the collaborative cross  strains   <cit>  and the f1-hybrids , all show a high proportion of recurrent cnvs .

some genomic regions contain recurrent events found in many of the samples. the region on chromosome  <dig>  was characterized by ngs  <cit>  as complex: a tandem duplication with a nested deletion. here, the region contains a mixture of amplifications and deletions, with the deletions typically found in wild-caught samples, whereas the amplifications were typically found in classical laboratory strains . this could indicate the same sv may be actually present in all samples, but array-based methods are not yet able to characterize this type of variation, or that this region is prone to multiple types of variation, which differ based on genetic background  <cit> . within the proximal third of chromosome  <dig> , we identified  <dig> cnvs and most of these are recurrent . amplifications in this region are more frequent than deletions  and there are  <dig> state-zero cnvs. an event was also found in a previous report at the regions seen on chromosome  <dig>  which was a copy number amplification with a nested deletion or inversion  <cit> . other events that appear similarly complex on chromosome  <dig> , were characterized previously as deletions  <cit> . the complexity here is likely due to the difficulty in resolving correct breakpoints with the method used, but may indicate a site with multiple events arising from different mutations.table  <dig> most common cnvs and complexa cnv regions

b for cnv events, each mouse with the cnv is counted. in complex regions, a mouse is counted if they have any cnvs in this region and are not counted twice if more than one cnv in this region is present


c gene names are as in mouse genome informatics symbol. gene types are one of: protein coding , rna type as listed, or pseudogene 


d this cnv event is contained within this complex region



within the wild-caught mice, cnvs that are present in more than five individuals of the same subspecies  and not found in the other subspecies were identified . of the six cnvs identified as putative private variants in the wild m. m. domesticus population, only three are seen in any classical laboratory strain , while all six are seen in the wild-derived strains. similarly, of the eight putative musculus-specific variants, only five are seen in the classical laboratory strains, while all eight are seen in the wild-derived strains. for the wild-derived strains  <dig>  % of the calls overlap with these putative private mutations, whereas  <dig>  % of the classical laboratory strain calls are in these regions. from this, it appears that for cnvs, the wild-derived strains capture more of the diversity seen in wild populations with respect to cnvs than classical laboratory strains.table  <dig> cnvs only in either wild-caught m. m. domesticus or m. m. musculus subspecies

enrichment of genomic features in cnvs
cnv regions were assessed for overlap with several genomic features and significant enrichments and depletions were identified by reshuffling the cnv calls  <dig> times to build bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals. amplification regions are enriched for cpg islands which were found in  <dig>  % of amplification calls. in contrast, deletions are depleted for cpg islands, overlapping only  <dig>  % of the deletion calls . cpg islands are also enriched in 500 bp and 1 kb regions spanning the ends of both deletion and amplification calls . cpg islands were shown to be overrepresented in cnv breakpoints in humans  <cit> . while gc content would increase the binding affinity for probes in gc rich regions, gc-model correction was performed prior to cnv detection, which should have mitigated or eliminated this source of bias  <cit> .

cnv regions 10 kb and larger are enriched for segmental duplications, as in cahan et al.  <cit> , with  <dig>  % of these calls overlapping annotated segmental duplication regions, approximately double that expected by chance . segmental duplication overlap is also enriched in the 500 bp, 1 kb and 2 kb regions centered around the endpoints of the 10 kb and larger cnv calls , as was seen for the breakpoints of svs not associated with transposable elements found by quinlan et al. <cit> . these findings support the emerging evidence that segmental duplications may cause local genetic instability, resulting in structural alterations like cnvs  <cit> .

a large portion of structural variation in the mouse genome is driven by transposable elements including short interspersed nuclear elements , long interspersed nuclear elements  and long terminal repeats   <cit> , but these regions are not well captured by array technologies because of the inherent difficulty in designing suitable probes for repetitive elements. in the probe sets used here, which were confirmed to have all probe sequences uniquely aligning to the reference genome, only  <dig>  % of the autosomal probes directly query annotated line, ltr or sine events.

the line and ltrs are present in a high proportion of cnv calls  but are depleted when compared to the randomly resampled genomic regions. a lower proportion of amplification calls was found to overlap these elements in the classical laboratory strains  compared to all amplification calls , as well as compared to both the wild-derived and wild-caught classification subgroups . a higher number of variants associated with transposable elements were found in several wild-derived strains compared to the c57bl/6 j reference by nellåker et al.  <cit> , which would present as an amplification  overlapping an annotated repeat element in our results. the higher proportion of line- and ltr-overlapping amplifications in wild-derived and wild-caught strains is therefore consistent. a lower proportion of deletions was found to overlap with line and ltr elements in classical laboratory strains as well, though the difference is not as pronounced.

when considering only calls of 10 kb or greater, lines and ltrs are enriched in deletions, while depleted in amplifications of this size, and are depleted in all calls below 10 kb in length . conversely, cnvrs of 10 kb and larger were enriched for lines and all cnvrs showed enrichment for ltr by cahan et al.  <cit> . all repeat elements showed enrichment in yalcin et al.  <cit> . sine elements, as expected, are enriched in all cnv calls, with a higher proportion of amplifications overlapping these regions  .

in several studies, the proportion of line and ltr elements was greater than the sine elements  <cit> , which is not the case here. it should be noted that here we report overlap with annotated elements. another confounding factor is that while  <dig>  % of the probes used target line, ltr or sine annotated genomic reference dna,  <dig>  % target intronic regions and  <dig>  % target exonic regions. this may explain why we see a depletion in line and ltr regions  and high proportions and enrichment of sine elements .

the start and end positions of cnv calls reported here are the genomic positions of the first and last probe contributing to the cnv call. with the median inter-probe-set distance of 319 bp, it is not possible to identify exactly the breakpoint of the event, let alone the sequence surrounding the event, which confounds mechanistic analysis or inference. while we do see similar results to that of other reported mechanism-related findings, this is only from investigating the trend across all samples, rather than classifying a putative mechanism for each specific call in a sample. mechanistic classification is better characterized using sequencing methods  <cit> , or targeted arrays of much higher resolution  <cit> .

gene content of cnvs
the majority  of cnvs entirely encompass at least one gene, are entirely encompassed by a gene or partially overlap with at least one gene . the proportion of cnvs containing protein-coding genes in the classical laboratory mice  is higher than in the wild-caught mice . the three main ensembl classification types, excluding regulatory elements, for regions that overlap cnvs are protein-coding genes , pseudogenes  and multiple classes of rnas .

protein coding genes were found in a higher proportion of amplifications  than deletions . pseudogenes were also found to overlap a higher proportion of amplifications  than deletions , as were rnas  and antisense gene regions . as expected, it is less likely to find deletions in these regions as they are likely to be deleterious  <cit> .

the most common cnv  is in  <dig> mice on chromosome  <dig> and contains the tmem181c-ps pseudogene . almost all  classical laboratory mice with this cnv have an amplification, while all wild-caught mice have a single-copy deletion. the second most common cnv  contains two pseudogenes, ear-ps <dig> and ear-ps <dig>  as well as two protein-coding genes, ang <dig> and ang <dig>  this cnv was observed only as a copy number state of either  <dig> or  <dig> and both states existed in classical laboratory and wild-caught mice subgroups. this cnv occurred most frequently in the bxd subgroup.

cnv differences were observed in samples from the same mouse strain. six of eight c57bl/6 j mice have an extra copy of the insulin-degrading enzyme  gene and half of the c57bl/6 j mice have an extra copy of the fibroblast growth factor binding protein  <dig>  gene. none of the c57bl/6nj mice have the ide or fgbp <dig> amplification. watkins-chow and pavan  <cit>  identified an increased copy number in ide and fgfbp <dig> in a large proportion of the c57bl/6 j mice that results in increased gene expression.

all eight c57bl/6 j mice in our study also have cnv amplifications overlapping most of skint <dig>  nlrp1b and slc25a <dig> although none of these genes were encompassed completely by a cnv like ide and fgfbp <dig>  single-copy deletions overlapping gm <dig> and btbd <dig> are also common . the skint <dig> two-copy amplification is also in all six c57bl/6nj mice. our data continue to support intrastrain cnv differences as important contributors to divergence from isogeneity  <cit> .

cnv amplifications that overlap with skint <dig>  nlrp1b, slc25a <dig>  ide and fgbp <dig> in our study were called as cnv deletions in non-c56bl/6 j laboratory strains in previous studies . similarly, the cnv deletions in btbd <dig> were called as cnv amplifications in previous studies  <cit> . gm <dig>  which appears as a deletion in our c57bl/6 j mice, appeared as a amplification in inbred mice in six other studies  <cit>  while one study found a mix of deletions and amplifications in this region  <cit> . this may indicate that the cnvs overlapping with these six regions  are widespread in the c57bl/6 j mouse and using this mouse strain may result in incorrect cnv states reported in other strains.

when only considering genes completely encompassed by cnvs and cnvs completely encompassed by genes , the top gene enrichment terms differed between wild-caught and classical laboratory mice. across classical laboratory mice, only the gene ontology  terms for amplifications are significant, while in wild-caught mice, go terms for both deletions and amplifications are significant . the most significant go term across classical laboratory mice is ‘antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen’ . most of the top go terms for classical laboratory mice are related to immunity or structural organization of the genome. laboratory mouse strains are frequently bred to display specific immunity or disease phenotypes and this may in part explain the go term enrichment across the classical laboratory mouse strains for immunity-related terms  <cit> . across wild-caught mice, go terms related to olfaction are significant for deletions while go terms related to pheromone response are significant for amplifications. olfaction- and pheromone-related genes, which can assist mice with social interactions and gaining information about their environment  <cit> , are not highly enriched in go term analysis for classical laboratory mouse strains, consistent with their laboratory breeding history. similar to cn variation, snp variation in pheromone receptors is lower in classical laboratory mice when compared to wild-derived mice  <cit> .

ingenuity pathway analysis  gene groupings into top diseases and functions networks show differences between wild-caught and classical laboratory mice for cnvs completely within or completely containing a gene, although the distinction isn’t as clear as with david . a total of  <dig> networks with an ipa score not less than  <dig> were identified. more networks are affected by amplifications  than by deletions  and, in particular, by amplifications across the classical laboratory strains .

an overrepresentation of lipid metabolism genes has been shown in cnv regions in wild-caught mice  <cit> . here, ‘lipid metabolism’ is among the top biological functions for a network associated with amplifications across wild-caught mice and is not found for cnvs in classical laboratory mice. conversely, classical laboratory mice have a network associated with ‘carbohydrate metabolism’ in amplifications, as well as ‘amino acid metabolism’ in one-copy deletions. this difference may indicate cn variation as an adaptive change to diet between wild-caught mice and classical laboratory strains. in humans and dogs, the copy number of the amylase  gene was found to vary and in dogs is also found to be amplified over wolves, conferring adaptation to a starch-rich diet  <cit> . across all of our samples, there is only one amplification in the mouse ortholog to these genes , found in the ybr/eij classical laboratory strain, so there is no evidence for an adaptive change to diet involving cnvs in the mouse amylase genes within our sample mouse population.

development terms were found in  <dig> of the  <dig> networks associated with cnv regions and included cellular development, tissue development and the development of a variety of systems . for all genes present in the mouse ,  <dig> out of  <dig> of their associated networks when analyzed as a whole with ipa include development terms, so this result is not unexpected.

across mouse strains, networks involved in ‘endocrine system development’ are associated with amplifications in wild-caught mice and with state-zero deletions in classical laboratory mice. networks involved in ‘cardiac system development’ are only associated with amplifications in classical laboratory mice and not associated with cnvs in wild-caught mice. networks involved in ‘inflammatory response’ are associated with cnvs  in the classical laboratory mice, but not in the wild-caught mice. networks involved in ‘cell mediated immune response’ were found to be associated with amplifications in both classical laboratory and wild-caught mice.

cnv calls may differ by strain due to strain-specific snps preventing the hybridization of probes and the target dna. subsequently, there will be a bias in the gene enrichment depending on how closely related a mouse is to the probe design reference.

genes unlikely to harbour copy-number deletions
cnvs were not found in  <dig> gene regions that are conserved across mammalian species and which have been used to construct phylogenetic trees   <cit> . autosomal genes adam <dig>  cdk <dig>  col7a <dig>  dll <dig>  dnmt3b, dyrk1a, eed, eln, ezh <dig>  igf <dig>  lama <dig>  med <dig>  med <dig>  med <dig>  med <dig>  pex <dig>  pknox <dig>  pdpk <dig>  slc2a <dig>  suz <dig>  vps <dig> and tfrc are known to cause deleterious phenotypes when gene expression levels are reduced and may be lethal at a zero-copy state or one-copy state, depending on the gene . therefore, deletions in these gene regions, particularly state zero deletions, are not expected. three mice appear to have partially lost one copy of col7a <dig>  unlike a zero-copy deletion, a single-copy deletion of col7a <dig> is not lethal. mice in this latter case are expected have a normal phenotype if gene expression levels are high enough  <cit> . as expected, no deletions were detected in any of the other autosomal genes listed above.

a number of genes on the x chromosome cause deleterious phenotypes when deleted, including aifm <dig>  alas <dig>  amer <dig> , bcor, cask, cul4b, ebp, flna, g6pdx, gyk, ikbkg, mecp <dig>  med <dig>  mtm <dig>  nsdhl, ofd <dig>  piga and porcn . two male mice from our analysis are partially missing the cask gene . although a knockout of cask is lethal, mice are still viable even if cask expression has been reduced by ~70 %  <cit> . sine and line deletions, up to 4761 bp in size, have been found in cask  <cit>  and a large cnv deletion covering the entire cask gene was identified in an acgh study  <cit> . as long as some degree of the functioning cask gene is maintained in the mouse it is possible for cask to acquire mutations or be lost in a cell population.

there are several possible explanations for observing cnv deletions that overlap genes that when deleted contribute to deleterious phenotypes. the deletions could be false positive calls or could be due to off-target mutations in the samples which prevent probes from binding in these areas. detecting deletions deleterious to a mouse may be biologically viable, and examples of somatic variants, in the tissue sampled given that gene's developmental stage-specific or tissue-specific expression. previous reports have also found several genes overlapping non-retrotransposon-related deletions over 500 bp from previous reports for the autosomes : adam <dig>  cdk <dig>  dnmt3b, dyrk1a, eed, ezh <dig>  lama <dig>  med <dig>  pdpk <dig> and pex <dig>  as well as on the x chromosome  <cit> : aifm <dig>  bcor, cask, cul4b, ebp, flna, g6pdx, gyk, ikbkg, mecp <dig>  nsdhl and porcn. single-copy losses or minimal expression of these genes can be tolerated in mice. previous reports do not list an integer copy number state, so it is possible that the reported deletions in these gene regions are one-copy-state deletions.

comparison of snp and cnv distance
after calculating the snp and cnv distance by probe set for the mgi priority strains and the strains from the  <dig> genomes project, we generated trees using neighbor joining  <cit>   and performed multidimensional scaling on the distance matrices to find the first two principal coordinates .fig.  <dig> snp and cnv distance for mgi priority and  <dig> genomes project strains. a. neighbor joining tree constructed using snp distance. b. multidimensional scaling  for snp distance matrix, showing first two principle coordinates. c. neighbour joining tree constructed using cnv distance. trees are not proportional to each other. the dashed line for ma/myj indicates a manually shortened branch. d. mds for cnv distance matrix. all diagrams are coloured based on similarity in snp distance 



the main source of variation in the snp distance  can be explained by the presence of a mus musculus musculus subspecific background  and mus musculus castaneus background   <cit> . the second source of variation  somewhat follows the percentage of mus musculus domesticus background. yang et al.  <cit>  showed that the a/j strain’s genome is approximately  <dig>  % domesticus in background, whereas the b <dig> mice are approximately  <dig>  %. these samples are the high and low extremes of the second principle coordinate  respectively .

the cnv distance measure does not replicate snp distance directly. the distance matrices for the snp and cnv calls are significantly positively correlated for the strains shown in fig. 4d . the positive correlation indicates that cnvs may follow a similar pattern of relatedness to snps, though do not directly recapitulate the same distances between strains. biologically, de novo cnvs would contribute to confounding the relatedness of individuals, though technical error is also a likely contributor to this discrepancy. the snp calls are less likely to be affected by technical error as they rely on relative intensity within a probe set, rather than a consecutive group of increased or decreased intensity values relative to a reference, which makes cnv analysis more susceptible to hybridization variation between chips and erroneous calls. this may explain why the snp trees somewhat follow expected structure, while the cnv tree has higher as-yet-unexplained variation.

several samples were excluded from fig. 4d, as these samples were the overwhelming source of variation in both the 1st and 2nd principle coordinates in the analysis when included . the samples removed either fail quality control for cnv calling  or were the top three highest number of calls in the passing samples . the exclusion of samples for having a higher-than-expected number of copy number calls was done in a similar study using human samples as a quality control measure  <cit> , where individuals above the 95th percentile for cnv number were excluded, a cutoff that the samples excluded here also meet.

off-target mutation can result in low call rates during genotyping, as seen in the work with vinos  <cit>  and may also affect cnv calling. while the affymetrix® power tools genotyping software does not output vino calls, it will call most vinos as either heterozygous or as “no calls”  <cit> . the difference in the snp “no call” rate within cnv calls by strain between passing and failing samples is not significant. it is significantly different, however, between wild-derived or wild-caught samples  and all other samples . the deletion rate is higher in these subgroups across the entire sample set of  <dig> mice, but it should be noted that the same trend is seen in amplification calls between these same subgroups . the same trend is also seen in the heterozygous call rate , which could indicate that these subgroups have a high rate of false positives, as we do not expect heterozygous calls in deleted regions.

droplet digital pcr confirmation of select genic cnvrs
for a total of  <dig> ddpcr confirmation assays,  <dig> of those reactions  were in agreement with a predicated cn state made based on a different mouse of that strain . there were no discordant cn calls among the ddpcr technical replicates. two of the selected cnvrs are known to contain genes ide and fgfbp <dig> that vary in copy number within the c57bl/6 j mouse strain  <cit> . the within strain differences in cn state for the gene fgfbp <dig> were also observed among the ddpcr assays for the  <dig> c57bl/6 j mice tested. the inter-strain differences in cn state for select genic cnvrs affecting hdhd <dig> and skint <dig> and glo <dig> genes were also confirmed by ddpcr. three of nine ddpcr gene assay results  matched the predicted cn state for all three mouse strains. skint <dig> and trim30e-ps <dig> cn states were zero for all cba/caj and dba/2 j mice when a cn state of two was predicted. for skint <dig>  a cn state of zero has been reported for dba/2 j  <cit> . the cn gains predicted for hdhd <dig> in cba/caj and dba/2 j mice were detected by ddpcr and called as a cn state of six in both strains. skint <dig> ddpcr cn states were found to be increased by one state for all three mouse strains when compared to the predicted states. contrary to predictions, itln <dig> ddpcr determined cn states did not differ from two in the five c57bl/6 j mice tested. notably, any differences from the predicted cn states are not necessarily indicative of mdga performance given that different mice were used for the microarray and ddpcr based determinations.

x chromosome analysis
cnv detection on the x chromosome was performed using the samples’ known sexes to establish an expected baseline copy number state. male mice have a much higher incidence of calls per mouse on the x chromosome when compared to female mice and have fewer deletions than amplifications, whereas female mice have about an equal number of deletions and amplifications . similar to the autosomes, there are more calls per mouse in the wild-derived and wild-caught mice than in the classical laboratory strains. the ratio of deletions to amplifications increases in wild-derived and wild-caught mice. the x chromosome has a large number of recurrent calls . this region overlaps the mid <dig> gene found at the distal end of the x chromosome in the pseudoautosomal region, known to have a high frequency of unequal crossovers  <cit> . in general, the unique to recurrent ratio is lower for all classes than is seen for the autosomes, with the classical laboratory strains having the fewest unique calls per mouse.

when compared to previous reports, only  <dig> calls overlap reciprocally by at least 20 %  and  <dig> by at least 1 bp . the majority of cnv deletions  do not overlap with protein- or rna-coding regions of the x chromosome or with pseudogenes, while the majority of cnv amplifications do overlap with these regions . this observation was expected because gene deletions on the x chromosome are more likely to be deleterious than amplifications. the most highly enriched go terms for cnvs on the x chromosome are generally related to chromosome organization and interaction with proteins. “chromosomal part” is the most significantly enriched go term for duplications  and “protein-dna complex” is ranked highest for deletions . go terms are not significantly enriched for genes overlapping with classical mouse cnvs or for wild-caught cnv amplifications. there are  <dig> significantly enriched go terms  for genes in wild-caught mouse deletions, almost all of which were related to the organization of the genome.

caveats of mdga for cnv detection
the false discovery rate as reported for penncnv software is 9 %  <cit> , however, this was calculated for calls from illumina microarrays. affymetrix® microarrays, including the mdga, use shorter probes  and tend to be noisier than longer-probe chips. we estimate the false positive rate for deletions to be  <dig>  %  <cit> , similar to previous work with penncnv on the affymetrix® human  <dig>  microarray which reported a 24 % false positive rate for deletions  <cit> .

the number of calls per chromosome is positively correlated with the number of probes per chromosome , which is an inherent ascertainment bias of probe-based technologies. also, there are large regions of the genome for which no suitable probe sets can be designed , or where probe sets are too sparse to result in cnv call passing our quality control measures. also, as mentioned, there are more probe sets covering exonic and intronic regions than intergenic regions.

the  <dig> samples that did not meet the quality control cutoff were analyzed separately. ten of these were wild-derived or wild-caught samples, including the mdgi, pwk hybrid and pwk/phj mice, as well as the msm/ms, cast/eij, ddo and four m. m. musculus individuals caught in poland, hungary and china. these mice would be expected to have a high amount of variation from the c57bl/6 j mouse for which the probe sets are targeted. many of the cnv calls we see for these mice  could errantly arise from their genomic dna failing to hybridize strongly to a number of probe sets in a genomic region because they have diverged from the c57bl/6 j mice in those regions, i.e. have undergone multiple base substitutions or mutations, rather than copy number changes. a similar phenomenon may be underlying deletion calls in diverse samples that passed quality control cutoffs. further biological confirmation would need to be performed to confirm if these are false positives or represent true variation in these strains.

several studies have suggested the use of multiple algorithms used in consort to call cnvs in order to increase reliability and biological conformation  <cit> . we have chosen to only use penncnv, as it was the only package at the time of writing that could be adjusted to use the igp probes present on mdga to produce integer copy number. this is the first study to our knowledge to use the igp probes. the comparison of calls made with both snp and igp probes, to those made only with snp probes, would essentially negate the use of the igps in the penncnv analysis. penncnv has been shown to work well in other similar studies for affymetrix® microarrays using human samples  <cit> .

to mitigate the effect of these caveats, biological validation, such as qpcr, would normally be performed using the same dna samples but was not feasible in this study, both in acquiring the same samples used for the study , as well as the scale of the project. herein, confirmation of select genic cnvrs in classical inbred strains is a first step toward biological validation and future work could be expanded for cnvs of biological interest. also, as research progresses toward characterizing higher levels of diversity, both the probe choice and algorithmic methods must be adapted.

CONCLUSIONS
the microarray is a valuable tool for large-scale analysis and when analyzed with rigour can provide insight into snp and cn variation. here, we used publically available microarray data and identified and characterized cn variation in a large sampling of mus musculus, with  <dig>  % of the calls reported for mice that had not been studied for cnvs. we provide several resources for researchers, including a probe list that has been filtered to avoid possible sources of noise in cnv analysis, a list of genes to use as a negative control in cnv studies as well as the cnv calls and strain information generated and analyzed here, all of which will inform future study.

we found differences in the genes affected by putative cnvs between wild-caught and classical laboratory mice, most notably in genes related to lipid, carbohydrate and amino-acid metabolism, as well as immunity, pheromone response and olfaction. this supports the hypothesis that cnvs play a role in increasing genetic diversity and have phenotypic impacts that when shaped by selective pressures confer adaptation.

with increasing research interest in somatic mosaicism, the mouse provides a direct way to analyze cnvs between tissues under a variety of controlled genetic backgrounds and environments. the mouse will continue to be a highly relevant model organism for understanding human development and disease, as an experimental system with a high level of control as well as tissue and cell type availability. our findings provide the most comprehensive picture to date of cnvs in mice using microarray technology.
