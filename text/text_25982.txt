BACKGROUND
transparent testa glabra  proteins are essential regulators of plant trichome and seed development  <cit>  and have been extensively studied in terms of the functional regulation . ttgs are characterized by the presence of the wd <dig> motif, which comprises the conserved tryptophan  and aspartic  dipeptide within a length of approximately  <dig> amino acid residues . with wd <dig>  ttgs can directly interact with various types of proteins or serve as interchangeable substrate adaptors that influence protein-protein interactions  <cit>  and therefore are capable of regulating both plant development and immunity  <cit> . depending on the biochemical characteristics of cooperative partners, ttgs possess different functions relating to development and immune response  <cit> .

tobacco  ntttg <dig> and ntttg <dig> share a high similarity and four wd <dig> repeats  <cit> . the wd <dig> domain enables ntttg <dig> to interact with elicitin protein para <dig>  which is produced by an oomycete pathogen and induces hypersensitive cell death in plants  <cit> . the ntttg1-para <dig> interaction is essential for the induction of programmed cell death initially in leaf trichomes and then in mesophylls, which in turn results in plant resistance to different pathogens  <cit> . in contrast, ntttg <dig> suppresses pathogen resistance in tobacco by indirectly modulating the subcellular localization of protein, noninducer of pathogenesis-related genes <dig>   <cit> , which is a transcription activator of immune response genes  <cit> . ntttg <dig> does not interact with npr <dig>  but sequesters npr <dig> from the nucleus, thereby preventing npr <dig> from transcriptionally regulating immune responses  <cit> . in another study paradigm, atttg <dig> of arabidopsis thaliana johannes thal interacts with the bhlh transcription factor gl <dig>  whereas its heterogenous binary complex further interacts with the myb transcription factor gl <dig> to form a wd40-bhlh-myb triplet, which regulates trichome development  <cit> . these findings suggest that ttgs regulate plant development or immunity by either directly or indirectly interacting with their functional partners.

we have elucidated the developmental function of ntttg <dig> by analyses of ntttg2-overexpressing  and ntttg <dig> silencing  transgenic tobacco lines compared to wild-type  plants or a transgenic control line  <cit> . the transgenic control line wt:rfp, which harbors the gene encoding red-fluorescent protein , resembles the wt in terms of vegetative growth, seed production, and related physiological responses such as floral anthocyanin synthesis and flower colorization  <cit> . in contrast, growth and development are greatly enhanced in ntttg2-overexpressing ttg2+:rfp lines  <cit> , which accumulate the ntttg2-rfp fusion protein in both the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . the ntttg2-confered traits of wt plants can be impaired by hairpin-based posttranscriptional gene silencing  <cit> .

we further demonstrate that the ntttg <dig> functional pathway for developmental regulation associates with the components of the auxin signaling pathway  <cit> . in particular, auxin-responsive genes have been identified by de novo assembly of the transcriptome of the wt, ttg2+, and ttg2i plants with a common tobacco variety nc <dig> background following rna-seq analyses  <cit> . the tobacco transcriptome contains  <dig> unigenes that are related to auxin responses, including  <dig> unigenes that are predicted to encode auxin response factor  proteins  <cit> . the expression levels of  <dig> putative ntarf genes were unrelated to ntttg <dig>  whereas the other  <dig> ntarf candidates were regulated by ntttg <dig> at the transcriptional level  <cit> . these findings suggest that the function of ntttg <dig> in plant development might be related to the auxin signaling pathway.

the auxin signaling pathway regulates various aspects of plant development  <cit>  through the function of arfs in transcriptional regulation of auxin responses . the regulatory consequence to developmental processes is either positive or negative as arfs may activate or repress auxin-responsive genes . in arabidopsis, for example,  <dig> arfs are categorized either as transcription activators or repressors  <cit> . arf transcription activators are characterized by the presence of several glutamine  residues in the middle region of protein sequence, whereas transcription repressors are serine-rich in the same region  <cit> . these arfs target auxin-responsive genes of the small auxin up rna , auxin/indole-acetic acid inducible , and gretchen hagen  <dig>  gene families . different arfs regulate the expression of target genes by binding the auxin response elements, tgtctc, gagaca  <cit> , or tgtct  <cit>  that are present in target promoters. these elements have numerous potential combinations with arfs  <cit> , but only a few auxin-responsive genes have been shown to be targeted and directly regulated by a specific ntarf  <cit> . moreover, arfs are functionally coregulated by various combinations of aux/iaa proteins  <cit> . in essence, despite the large number of arfs characterized in arabidopsis and other species, direct targets of arfs and the individual and combinatorial roles remain largely unknown, particularly in species other than arabidopsis.

the purpose of the present study was to identify ntarf genes that are associated with the developmental role of ntttg <dig>  and to elucidate the functional relationship between ntttg <dig> and relevant ntarfs in tobacco. we focused on  <dig> ntarf candidates that have been previously demonstrated to be regulated by ntttg <dig> for expression in tobacco  <cit> . we followed the accepted nomenclature in designating ntarf gene candidates as number-suffixed arfs based on the highest similarities with the corresponding orthologs of different plant species.

previously, a posttranscriptional gene silencing  system was developed with dna components of the monopartite begomovirus sp. tobacco curly shoot virus  <cit> . we have used the tcsv vigs system to silence ntttg <dig>  <cit>  and immunity-regulatory genes  <cit>  in tobacco. in the present study, we employed the same system to silence the ntarf genes under backgrounds of wt:rfp, ttg2+:rfp, and ttg2i. based on the gene silencing effects, we propose that ntttg <dig> predominantly regulates ntarf <dig>  followed by ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig>  to control vegetative growth and seed production in tobacco.

RESULTS
ntttg <dig> responds to auxin but does not affect endogenous auxin levels
to infer the functional relationship between ntttg <dig> and auxin, we analyzed ntttg <dig> expression in leaves of wt tobacco treated with an aqueous solution containing a surfactant and a synthetic auxin, 1-naphthaleneacetic acid , and with the surfactant solution as control. the naa treatment highly induced ntttg <dig> expression based on quantitative real-time rt-pcr  analysis performed at a 10-min interval in 60 h after plant treatment . in the period, quantities of ntttg <dig> transcript were increased by 4–6-fold following the naa treatment compared to the steady-state transcript level of the control . marked enhancement of ntttg <dig> expression was confirmed by northern blotting that was performed at 60 h after plant treatment. in northern blotting, the ntttg <dig> transcript was detected at a steady-state level compared to the constitutively expressed ef1α gene in control plants, whereas ntttg <dig> was upregulated after naa treatment .fig.  <dig> the expression of ntttg <dig> in response to synthetic auxin naa. plants were treated by spraying over tops with a surfactant solution in control or with an naa solution containing the surfactant. relative levels of ntttg <dig> expression were quantified by rt-qpcr as the transcript quantity ratios to the constitutively expressed ef1α gene used as a reference. data shown are mean values ± standard errors from mean  of results obtained from three experimental replicates, i.e., the number of replicates  =  <dig>  inset is northern blot hybridization performed at 60 h after plant treatment



we measured the endogenous concentrations of iaa in leaves of wt:rfp, ttg2+:rfp, and ttg2i plants. the ttg2+:rfp line showed the best developmental traits with the highest level of ttg <dig> overexpression, and the ttg2i line displayed the highest degrees of ntttg <dig> silencing and developmental compromise  <cit> . no distinct differences in endogenous iaa content in the aerial organs were observed among the three tobacco genotypes were observed. in all plants, iaa concentrations were detected at basal levels of approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and 230 ng/g fresh weight of leaves, flowers, and immature fruits , respectively . therefore, ntttg <dig> is responsive to exogenous auxin application, whereas no effect was observed using endogenous auxin content. because ntarfs are essential for auxin signaling and function of downstream processes of auxin biosynthesis  <cit> , we considered ntttg2-regulated ntarf candidates  <cit>  with respect to the functional connection between ntttg <dig> and auxin signaling.

the  <dig> ntttg2-regulated ntarf candidates represent  <dig> ntarf genes
according to conventional nomenclature of unigenes identified by the rna-seq technique  <cit> , ntttg2-regulated ntarf candidates present in the tobacco transcriptome were specified with unigene codes  <cit> . for the sake of convenient descriptions, we designated ntarf unigenes as conventional gene symbols, with ntarf suffixed by numbers. based on the highest similarities of unigenes with ntarf orthologs previously identified in different plant species, the  <dig> ntttg2-regelated ntarf unigenes represented  <dig> ntarf genes because two unigenes were classified under the same ntarf gene . sequence similarities were considered with tobacco species as first priority over other plants such as arabidopsis and tomato . the  <dig> ntttg2-regulated tobacco ntarf genes were thus designated as ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf6l , ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig> to ntarf <dig>  and ntarf19l  . similarities in nucleotide sequences were easily compared with published arf homologs by using blast.

the  <dig> ntarfs fall into ntttg2-upregulated and -downregulated groups
to elucidate the functional relationship between ntttg <dig> and ntarf genes, the  <dig> ntttg2-regulated ntarfs were silenced under backgrounds of wt:rfp, ttg2+, and ttg2i, followed by assessments of gene expression levels in leaves of distinct plant genotypes. the vigs system previously developed with dna components of tcsv  <cit>  and recently used by our group to silence ntarf <dig>  <cit>  was employed in the present study to construct silencing units of an additional  <dig> ntarf genes . in parallel experiments, ntarf gene silencing constructs was used to transfect tobacco plants, followed by verification of transgene integration into the plant genome . then, relative levels of ntarf gene expression were quantified by rt-qpcr, which varied with the genetic background of each plant .fig.  <dig> vigs manipulations of ntarf genes and gene silencing efficiencies. a diagrams of the two-component gene-silencing constructs. b technical scheme. the two gel panels represent one of six experimental repeats each containing nine transfected wt:rfp plants tested in comparison with wt:rfp. top gel panel is the result of pcr analysis of genomic dna, and lower gel panel is the result of rt-pcr analysis. codes of transfected plants are arbitrary. c relative levels of different ntarfs in leaves of plants indicated under the corresponding bar graphs. the expression level of each ntarf was quantified by rt-qpcr as the transcript quantity ratio of the ntarf gene to ef1α used as a reference gene based on its constitutive expression. data shown are mean values ± sem bars 



the elaborate experimental protocol resulted in high gene silencing efficiencies, as shown by marked decreases in the quantities of the corresponding gene transcripts as detected by semi-quantitative rt-pcr  and rt-qpcr  analyses. all  <dig> ntttg2-regulated ntarf genes were silenced at high efficiencies  compared to the steady-state expression levels under wt:rfp background . under the ttg2+:rfp background, ntarf6l and ntarf19l had fewer transcripts, but the additional ten genes  accumulated more transcripts than the wt:rfp plant. these genes showed opposite behaviors under a ttg2i background compared to ttg2+:rfp . thus, ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> comprised a group of ntttg2-upregulated ntarf genes, whereas ntarf6l and ntarf19l represented the downregulated group. in the ten ntttg2-upregulated ntarfs, ntarf <dig> displayed the highest degree of expression enhancement by ntttg <dig> . on the basis of downregulation by ttg2i, expression levels of ntttg2-upregulated ntarfs were further reduced in double gene silencing ttg2i/arfi lines. inversely, ntarf expression levels were partially recovered in ttg2+:rfp/arfi plants, which resulted from the silencing ntarfs under a ttg2+:rfp background . the high levels of single ntarf gene silencing and the synergistic effects of ntttg <dig> and ntarf double modifications of ntarf expression may be further investigated in future studies to elucidate the roles of ntarfs in ntttg2-regulated plant growth and development.

ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> contribute to ntttg2-regulated plant growth
recently we characterized the role of ntttg <dig> in tobacco growth based on increases of the biomass  of plants grown in a medium and in pots, respectively  <cit> . the contributions of the different ntarf genes to ntttg2-regulated tobacco growth were evaluated by direct observation of growth rates  and by comparing fresh weight changes  of the different plants at 15 days after transfection. no apparent differences in growth rates between wt:rfp and wt were observed, neither between ttg2+ and ttg2+:rfp plants , thereby confirming the absence of any phenotypic effects in the controls. the potential effects of ntarfs on ntttg2-regulated plant growth were assessed by imaging plants with and without ntarf gene silencing manipulations . the low degree of plant growth repression was caused by silencing ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf6l, and ntarf <dig>  respectively . a marked repression of growth was observed with ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  or ntarf <dig> silencing. independent silencing of the three ntarfs caused a marked reduction in plant size under the wt:rfp background, further reduction in ttg2i plant size, and a decrease in plant growth enhancement by ttg2+ . in contrast, silencing ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  or ntarf19l did not cause evident changes in plant growth rates under the same genetic background .fig.  <dig> plants photographed two weeks after transfection for gene silencing manipulations. wt , ttg2

the observed differences in plant growth extents were confirmed by quantifying fold-changes in fresh weight of transfected plants compared to control plants . similar weight changes  were observed in ttg2+ and ttg2+:rfp plants, whereas the weight of wt:rfp plants showed minimal change compared to that of the wt . these plants were used as basis in assessing the effects of ntarf silencing under the corresponding genetic backgrounds . a less than  <dig> -fold decrease or no evident changes were observed with silencing of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf6l, ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig> or ntarf19l under the wt:rfp background . similar results were obtained with silencing any of these ntarf genes under the backgrounds of ttg2+  and ttg2i . in contrast, plant weight showed a  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold, and  <dig> -fold decrease, respectively, when ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> were silenced under the wt:rfp background . moreover, a 2-fold decrease in plant weight was observed after the independent silencing of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> under the ttg2i background  compared to that observed under wt:rfp . when ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> were silenced under a ttg2+ background, the extent of ttg2+-conferred plant growth enhancement was reduced by  <dig> -fold  and  <dig> -fold, respectively . a stronger impairment to ttg2+ plant growth was observed with ntarf <dig> silencing, which totally cancelled the growth enhancement effect and further decreased fresh weight by  <dig> -fold . these findings suggest that ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> are major coregulators of the ntttg <dig> functional pathway for the plant growth, whereas ntarf <dig> plays a predominant role.

ntarf <dig> is the predominant interactor of ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> in ntttg2-regulated plant growth
to confirm the roles of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> in the ntttg <dig> functional pathway, we investigated changes in fresh weight of ttg2+ plants following transfection of different leaves with each of the three ntarf vigs constructs and with double and triple combinations at various time points. in all transfected plants, the three genes were silenced by >95 % and in an independent manner . for example, silencing ntarf <dig> did not affect the expression levels of ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig>  whereas concurrent silencing of ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> did not affect ntarf <dig> expression. in addition, the expression levels of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> were simultaneously downregulated only with the triple gene silencing manipulation in single plants .fig.  <dig> concurrent ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> silencing manipulations and the subsequent effects on plant growth. a

plant weight was determined at 14 days after the last round of transfection. based on fold-changes in fresh weight in ntarf-silenced ttg2+ lines compared to the wt plant, double or triple gene silencing manipulations acted synergistically in impairing ttg2+-conferred plant growth enhancement after single gene silencing . the most extensive compromise in plant growth enhancement was observed after silencing ntarf <dig> under double or triple gene silencing conditions. in double combinations, ntarf <dig> silencing further reduced plant weight by  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold based on independent reductions by ntarf <dig> and afr <dig> silencing. however, silencing of ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> concurrently with ntarf <dig> caused an additional 25 % and 38 % decrease in plant weight compared to silencing ntarf <dig> alone. the triple gene silencing manipulation further reduced plant weight by  <dig> –,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold  over the single gene silencing effects of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig>  respectively. clearly, silencing of ntarf <dig> was more repressive to plant growth than silencing ntarf <dig> or ntarf <dig>  furthermore, ntarf <dig> was expressed in the growing leaves of 10–50-day-old plants, much higher than that observed in ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> . during plant growth, the ratios of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig> transcripts to the reference gene  were  <dig> – <dig> ,  <dig> – <dig> , and  <dig> – <dig> , respectively. these findings suggest that ntarf <dig> plays a predominant role in the genetic cooperation with ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> in order for ntttg <dig> to regulate plant growth.

ntarf <dig> contributes to ntttg2-regulated seed production
similar to foliar expression , ntarf <dig> is also expressed in other organs, including immature fruits, in an ntttg2-dependent manner . thus, ntarf <dig> may participate in the ntttg2-regulated developmental process in addition to the vegetative growth. we tested this hypothesis by analyzing the functional relationship between the ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> genes for tobacco seed production, which is an important developmental trait that is regulated by ntttg <dig>  <cit> . we confirmed the synergistic effect of concurrent ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> silencing on the vegetative growth of elder plants  compared to that of younger plants . we also confirmed the genetic cooperation of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> by evaluating the effect of concurrent gene overexpression on plant growth . the transformation of wt and ttg2+:rfp plants with ntarf <dig>  which was fused to the gene encoding yellow-fluorescent protein , resulted in the transgenic lines, arf8+:yfp and ttg2+:rfp/arf8+:yfp, respectively. five arf8+:yfp lines and five ttg2+:rfp/arf8+:yfp lines were characterized based on plant growth enhancements, as indicated by the independent and concurrent overexpression of ntarf <dig> and ntttg <dig> .fig.  <dig> the effects of concurrent ttg <dig> and arf <dig> modifications on plant growth and seed production. plants were grown in the greenhouse . a appearance of 50-day-old plants. b plant height scoring. c, d seed production and fruit appearance. data shown in b, c, e are means ± sem bars; different letters indicate significant differences among plant genotypes 



we compared an arf8+:yfp line and a ttg2+:rfp/arf8+:yfp line with wt:rfp, ttg2i, ntarf8i, ttg2i/ntarf8i, and ttg2+:rfp plants in terms of seed production quantity. although seed densities in fruits were similarly observed in some genotypes , the number of seeds in a single fruit significantly varied with genetic modification of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> . independent silencing of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> resulted in acute seed abortion, whereas more than 97 % and 96 % seeds were aborted , respectively, in ntttg2i and ntarf8i plants compared to that observed in wt:rfp. more severe seed abortion resulted from concurrent ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> silencing, which further reduced seed number per fruit over the single gene silencing effects . seed abortion lead to shrunken fruits, which is as an evident phenotype that was associated with ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> silencing compared to the observed normal seed appearance with wt:rfp . in contrast, the independent overexpression of ntttg <dig> or ntarf <dig> substantially promoted seed production, causing a 45 % and 32 % increase in seed numbers in single fruits , along with the formation of plump fruits . an enhancement of seed production was observed with concurrent ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> overexpression, which resulted in an 11 % and 24 % increase in seed number compared to the effects of the independent overexpression of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig>  respectively . these findings suggest that ntarf <dig> is an essential component of ntttg2-regulated seed production in tobacco. this notion is in agreement with the altered ntttg <dig> expression in young fruits  and additionally confirms the role of ntttg <dig> in seed production  <cit> .

ntarf <dig> is a functional transcription activator of illustrational target gene
the ntarf <dig> protein  is the predicted protein of the ntarf <dig> gene, which we recently cloned from the common tobacco variety, nc <dig>  <cit> . the putative ntarf <dig> protein is highly identical at the amino acid level to well-characterized homologs  and shares the conserved q tract at the middle region , which characterizes arf transcription activators  <cit> . the q-rich region spans residue sites  <dig> to  <dig> in the ntarf <dig> sequence , which consists of  <dig> amino acids in total. based on these structural characteristics, ntarf <dig> is a potential transcription activator.fig.  <dig> partial sequence characterization and assays of the ntarf <dig> protein as a transcription activator. a partial sequence of the predicted ntarf <dig> protein. the ntarf <dig> sequence contains  <dig> amino acids and only the middle region is presented to indicate glutamine  abundance as the characteristics of arf transcription activators. b an emsa assay of the ntarf8-his  fusion protein, the wt probe for the auxin-responsive tgtct element, which is present in the gh <dig> gene promoter, and the mutant probe. c chip pcr conducted with chromatins isolated from leaves of plants indicated on left, the specific yfp antibody, and primers specific to the promoter and cds of gh <dig>  bands in gel indicate products of pcr conducted with dna templates from the precipitated complex consisting of chromatin fragments and the ntarf8-yfp fusion protein , the mock precipitation in the absence of the antibody , and chromatins before immunoprecipitation , respectively. d
gh <dig> expression levels quantified by rt-qpcr. the wt transcript quantity ratio of gh <dig> to ef1α was defined as  <dig> and scored accordingly for arf8i and arf8
+:yfp. data shown are mean values ± sem bars 



to validate this prediction, we used the gh <dig>  gene to illustrate the role of ntarf <dig> in transcriptional activation. the rationale behind this experiment is that gh <dig> is an auxin-responsive gene in tobacco  <cit>  and was recently detected in the ntttg2-regulated profile of the tobacco transcriptome  <cit> . gh <dig> expression is ntttg2-dependent, enhanced by ntttg <dig> overexpression, but repressed by ntttg <dig> silencing, whereas ntarf <dig> performs as an ntttg <dig> gene, affecting gh <dig> expression . moreover, typical auxin response element tgtct  <cit>  exists as two repeats  in the gh <dig> promoter . in an electrophoresis mobility shift assay , this element prepared as a wt probe was shown to bind to the ntarf8-his fusion protein, but not the mutant acagc .

chromatin immunoprecipitation  using chromatin isolated from wt:rfp, ntarf8i, and ntarf8+:yfp leaves was performed to test whether ntarf <dig> could bind to the gh <dig> promoter. the specific rfp antibody was used to identify the target dna composition of the chromatin sample, and the target dna was assumed to combine with the arf8-rfp fusion protein present in the same chromatin sample. the precipitated dna was quantified by pcr in parallel with two pertinent controls. one was the input reference, in which a part of the chromatin sample was not subjected to immunoprecipitation. another was the antibody-absent reference , in which a different part of the chromatin sample was subjected to the standard immunoprecipitation procedure in the absence of the antibody. these dna samples were pcr amplified using primers that were specific to the promoter or coding sequence  of the gh <dig> gene. figure 7c shows that no gh <dig> cds dna was detected in the chromatin of the three plants, whereas the gh <dig> promoter was detected only in the ntarf8+:yfp chromatin samples, thereby suggesting the specific binding of ntarf <dig> to the promoter. similarly, the gh <dig> gene was expressed in arf8+:yfp or wt:rfp, but not in arf8i plants, and the gene transcript was 5-fold higher in arf8+:yfp plants than in wt:rfp plants . these findings indicated that ntarf <dig> indeed is a transcription activator of the illustrational target gene.

ntttg <dig> facilitates nuclear localization of ntarf8
to infer how ntttg <dig> regulates the function of ntarf <dig> as a transcription activator, we tested whether both proteins directly interacted. no interaction was detected by using a yeast two-hybrid assay or by bimolecular fluorescence complementation . then, we monitored the subcellular distributions of both ntttg2-rfp and ntarf8-yfp fusion proteins after transfecting the roots of wt:rfp, ttg2i, and ttg2+:rfp plants with the ntarf8:yfp fusion gene. fluorescence imaging of transfected root cells indicated that the subcellular localization of ntarf <dig> changed with ntttg <dig> quantity alterations . fluorescence was absent under the ttg2i background, whereas high levels of rfp fluorescence was observed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the wt:rfp cells. under the ttg2+:rfp background, strong fluorescence of the ntttg2-rfp fusion protein was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus . the three genetic backgrounds had different impacts on the subcellular localization of the ntarf8-yfp fusion protein. this protein was observed with ttg2i, at a high level of accumulation in the wt:rfp and ttg2+:rfp roots . similar to the dual localization of ntttg <dig>  ntarf8-yfp was also detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of wt:rfp cells. in ttg2+:rfp, ntarf8-yfp was predominantly detected in the nucleus .fig.  <dig> the effects of altered ntttg <dig> protein quantities on subcellular localization of the ntarf <dig> protein and associated gene expression. a confocal microscopic imaging of roots transformed with the arf8-yfp fusion gene. scale bars = 100 μm. b, c percentage of root cells showing ttg2-rfp and arf8-yfp fluorescence signals, respectively, only in the cytoplasm, only in the nucleus, or in both compartments. cells in totally  <dig> fields of vision were counted for rfp and yfp fluorescence signals, respectively. data shown are mean values ± sem bars . d western blots showing protein levels in cytoplasmic  and nuclear  fractions isolated from leaf cells. pepc and histone h <dig> were used as cytosolic and nuclear markers, respectively. e chip pcr analyses to quantify levels of the affinity for ntarf8-yfp binding with the gh <dig> promoter. f expression levels of related genes quantified by rt-qpcr as the transcript quantity ratios to ef1α. data shown in e, f are mean values ± sem bars 



to quantify the effect of altered ntttg <dig> levels on the subcellular localization of ntarf <dig>  we counted the number of root cells showing fluorescence of ntttg2-rfp  or ntarf8-yfp  only in the cytoplasm, only in the nucleus, and simultaneously in both. our observations confirmed the dual localization of ntttg2-rfp in both the cytoplasm and nucleus . the number of cells with cytoplasmic, nuclear, or dual location of ntarf8-yfp was determined by quantities of ntttg <dig> under the different genetic backgrounds . ntarf8-yfp was detected only in the cytoplasm and only in the nuclei at approximately equivalent proportions  of wt:rfp cells, whereas ntarf8-yfp was exclusively localized to nuclei in more than 95 % of the ttg2+:rfp cells. in both cytoplasmic and nuclear spaces, ntarf8-yfp was observed at small amounts or was not detected under the ttg2i background . these data suggest that overexpressed ntttg <dig> promoted ntafr <dig> localization to the nucleus.

ntttg2-facilitated nuclear localization of ntarf <dig> enhances its role as a transcriptional activator
the results of root cell fluorescence imaging  were in agreement with the findings of immunoblotting analysis of proteins from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of leaf cells . cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were analyzed together with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase  and histone h <dig>  which were used as cytoplasmic and nuclear markers, respectively  <cit> . a group of protein blots were hybridized with the ntttg <dig> antibody, which was generated by immunizing a new zealand white rabbit in our previous study  <cit> . this hybridization detected remarkable quantities of the ntttg <dig> protein in wt:rfp and ttg2+:rfp plants, although a low protein expression level was observed with ttg2i. while similar levels of ntttg <dig> were observed in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of wt:rfp, a higher level was observed in the nucleus compared to that detected in the cytoplasm of ttg2+:rfp cells . an independent group of protein blots were hybridized with a specific commercially manufactured yfp antibody  <cit> . hybridization showed that the ntarf8-yfp fusion protein was expressed at similar amounts in the cytoplasm and nucleus of wt:rfp cells, whereas it was downregulated in ttg2i cells. in ttg2+:rfp cells, a high level of ntarf8-yfp was detected in the nucleus, whereas a lower level was observed in the cytoplasm . these findings confirmed that overexpressed ntttg <dig> facilitates in the localization of ntarf <dig> to the nucleus. these results also suggest that sufficient production and nuclear localization of ntttg <dig> are required for the nuclear localization of ntarf <dig> 

nuclear localization is a prerequisite for transcription factors to function in gene expression regulation  <cit> . thus, it is logical to hypothesize that ntttg2-modulated subcellular localization of ntarf <dig> is mandatory to affect the expression of the gh <dig> gene, which was used as an illustrational target of ntarf <dig> . a possible intermediate mechanism is that increased nuclear localization offers more opportunities for the transcription factor to bind to the target promoter. this hypothesis was validated by the chip pcr assay and by quantification of gene expression levels in leaves. a foliar chip dna sample was quantified by rt-qpcr in parallel with a dna sample from the input reference and another dna sample from the ab-absent reference. by using this elaborate assay, the affinity of ntarf8-yfp binding with the gh <dig> promoter  was quantified as relative amounts of pcr product from quantitative leaf samples that were processed in a uniform reaction volume. figure 8e shows that a very low degree of arf8-gh3p binding affinity was detected with ttg2i/arf8:yfp compared to the reference level from input. inversely, arf8-gh3p binding affinity significantly increased with ttg2+:rfp/arf8:yfp compared to that observed with wt:rfp/arf8:yfp background . these findings indicate that ntttg2-facilitated nuclear localization of ntarf <dig> increases its ability to bind with the gh <dig> promoter. gh <dig> was thus upregulated in ttg2+:rfp leaves, but its expression was highly repressed in ttg2i:rfp compared to the observed steady-state expression in leaves of wt:rfp plants . a similar pattern of foliar expression was observed with ntarf <dig> and ntttg <dig> . therefore, ntarf <dig> and ntttg <dig> involve a concerted regulatory mechanism at the transcription level in addition to its concomitant role in subcellular localization.

ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> coordinately respond to auxin
the functional coordination of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> was further evidenced by the concomitant expression of both genes under two circumstances. first, ntttg <dig> silencing and overexpression resulted in a significant enhancement and repression of ntarf <dig> expression, respectively, whereas similar modifications of ntarf <dig> did not affect ntttg <dig> expression . therefore, ntttg <dig> is indispensable to ntarf <dig> expression, implying that ntttg <dig> functions upstream of ntarf <dig> in regulating the plant growth and development. second, ntarf <dig> resembled ntttg <dig> in terms of its response to auxin and expression enhancement in 60 h after naa application to the wt plant . in a parallel experiment, the amount of ntarf <dig> transcripts increased by  <dig>  times at 60 h after the naa treatment compared to the control. at the same time point, ntttg <dig> expression was upregulated  <dig>  times compared to the steady-state levels in detected in the control . the coordinate responses of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> to exogenously applied naa suggest that both genes are concurrently involved in auxin signaling.fig.  <dig> coordinate responses of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> to auxin. wt plants were treated by spraying over tops with a surfactant solution  or an naa solution containing the surfactant. gene expression in leaves was analyzed at the indicated time points by rt-qpcr using ef1α as a reference gene. data shown are mean values ± sem bars 



discussion
previous studies have shown that ttgs regulate plant developmental processes and/or immune responses by interacting or cooperating with different functional partners  <cit> . in the arabidopsis trichome developmental model, the functional partners of atttg <dig> include two distinct transcription factors, a bhlh  <cit>  and a myb  <cit> . in tobacco, ntttg <dig> regulates immune responses by recognizing a biotic elicitor and involving transcription factor, npr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, ntttg <dig> is characteristic of an immunity repressor, which particularly suppresses the npr <dig> functional pathway to confer disease susceptibility  <cit> . ntttg <dig> also acts as a positive regulator of development and functions in association with auxin signaling, particularly in relation to the differential expression of  <dig> ntarf genes  <cit> . in the present study, we elucidated a previously unappreciated mechanism by which ntttg <dig> regulates vegetative growth and seed production. this novel mechanism is executed by the genetic cooperation of ntarf <dig>  ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig>  which are abundantly expressed in the ntttg2-upregulated transcriptional profile of auxin-related genes  <cit>  . we further elucidated that ntarf <dig> plays a predominant cooperative role with ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig> that influences the ntttg <dig> functional pathway.

we have shown that arf <dig> is a major mechanistic linker between ntttg <dig> and auxin signaling in the regulation of tobacco growth and development. evidence has been provided at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, as well as the cytological scale, particularly with respect to the functional relationship between ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> genes and proteins. at the transcriptional level, the ntttg <dig> gene is induced by the exogenously applied auxin , but alterations in the expression levels of ntttg <dig> does not affect the endogenous content of auxin in different plant organs . based on the link between ntttg <dig> and auxin signaling, the ntarf <dig> gene appears to be the most possible candidate. ntarf <dig> is one of newly characterized  <dig> ntttg2-regulated ntarf genes  that were originally identified as  <dig> putative arf genes in the tobacco transcriptome  <cit> . the expression of ntarf <dig>  was upregulated by ntttg <dig> overexpression and downregulated by ntttg <dig> silencing. under the same conditions, ntarf <dig>  and ntarf <dig>  showed a similar behavior as that of ntarf <dig>  with lower levels of expression than ntarf <dig> but higher than the additional  <dig> ntttg2-regulated arf genes  <cit> . these findings suggest that ntttg <dig> acts after auxin production to regulate arf gene expression.

based on the gene silencing effects,  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> characterized arf genes were respectively positively and negatively regulated ntttg <dig> . in the ntttg2-upregulated genes, ntarf <dig> silencing was more effective than silencing ntarf <dig> or ntarf <dig> to repress the growth and to eradicate the enhanced growth effect of ntttg <dig> overexpression . this finding is suggestive of the dominant role of ntarf <dig> in relation to ntarf <dig> and ntarf <dig>  by integrating these findings with those of the gene silencing effects on seed production quantity , we propose that ntarf <dig> is an integral component of ntttg2-regulated plant growth and development. at the molecular level, the functional relationship between ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> differs from that of the wd40-bhlh-myb complex for the trichome development  <cit> , and is also distinct from that of the atarf8-bhlh interaction for petal growth  <cit>  in arabidopsis. at the phenotypic level, the functional pathway consisting of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> is responsible for vegetative growth and seed production, but whether it also affects other ntttg2-regulated traits  <cit>  remains to be determined.

at the cytological level, the ntttg <dig> protein indirectly regulates the function of ntarf <dig> as a transcription activator by modulating its localization to the nucleus . the function of ntarf <dig> as a transcription activator has been demonstrated by using gh <dig>  which is an ntttg2-regulated auxin-responsive gene that was previously identified in tobacco  <cit>   as an ntarf <dig> potential target genes. the rationale behind the selection of the tobacco gh <dig> gene was based on the stimulatory effect of atarf <dig> on the expression of gh <dig> orthologs in arabidopsis  <cit> , namely the presence of a typical auxin response element  in the gh <dig> promoter . based on element recognition by arf transcription activators  <cit> , the ability of the ntarf <dig> protein to combine with the gh <dig> promoter is in line with gh <dig> expression levels that decreased by silencing but increased with ntarf <dig> overexpression . the transcription regulatory activity of ntarf <dig> requires nuclear import under modulation by the ntttg <dig> protein, whereas ntttg <dig> fulfill this cytological role depending on its dual location in the cytoplasm and nucleus . when ntttg <dig> remains at the steady-state level under wt background, ntarf <dig> is also produced at the same steady-state level with the dual location . this observation implies that the steady-state level of ntarf <dig> is sufficient in regulating ntttg2-conferred development. this assumed dynamic relationship between ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> is in agreement with the ready-state level of the ntttg <dig> protein or the gene transcript  <cit>   and with the basal level of auxin  under a wt background. with overexpression, however, increased amounts of the ntttg <dig> protein result in elevated proportions of ntarf <dig> localization to the nucleus, accompanied by t gh <dig> upregulation . thus, the nuclear localization of ntarf <dig> and its performance to activate target gene expression are essential steps in the ntttg <dig> functional pathway. this pathway is executed by a crosstalk with auxin signaling, as evidenced by coordinate responses of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> to auxin  and by the ntttg2-dependent role of ntarf <dig> in regulating transcription of the auxin-response gene .

the tobacco gh <dig> gene was used only as an example of an ntarf <dig> target gene to elucidate the function of ntarf <dig> as a transcription activator. we did not intend to elucidate whether gh <dig> contributes to ntttg2-conferred tobacco growth and development. gh <dig> genes encode iaa-conjugating enzymes that presumably terminate the auxin signal for plants to retrieve auxin hypersensitivity or elicit biotic stress responses during plant growth and development  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atarf <dig> overexpression results in enhanced gh <dig> expression, a 30 % increase of auxin content, and the development of short hypocotyls  <cit> . these findings indicate that the role of ntarf <dig> in plant growth is related to the proper level of apical dominance as a function of the auxin signal. at present, we do not have evidence that shows whether this auxin homeostasis mechanism is involved in the ntttg2-ntarf <dig> functional pathway for the regulation of tobacco growth and development.

concomitant changes in the subcellular localization of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> are critical for ntarf <dig> to execute the function in the transcriptional regulation of the illustrational target gene . the nuclear localization and transcription regulatory activity of ntarf <dig> apparently requires the upregulation of the ntarf <dig> protein. in this case, ntarf <dig> gene expression could be induced to ensure further production of the protein that is caused by ntttg <dig> overexpression. thus, nuclear localization of ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig> likely induces a feedback mechanism involving the transcription of the specific genes. this hypothesized feedback scheme may take place, for example, when ntarf <dig> executes its function on auxin-responsive genes in the presence of npr <dig> to activate immune response genes. in the latter case, npr <dig> is hydrolyzed after a single round of gene activation such new npr <dig> molecules are used in every round of transcriptional regulation  <cit> . however, this proteolysis model does not exclude an alternative mechanism, i.e., overexpressed ntttg <dig> transports a high amount of ntarf <dig> into the nucleus, where ntarf <dig> functions to activate a large number of auxin-responsive genes such as gh <dig> . a central question for both models is how ntarf <dig> is physically connected with ntttg <dig>  because ntttg <dig> does not directly interact with ntarf <dig> , additional components that fill the apparent gap in ntttg2-mediated nuclear import of ntarf <dig> should be identified. the candidates are most likely to be particular members of the impotin protein family as these proteins function as cargo carriers for the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of proteins and nucleic acids  <cit> . unknown mediators such as importins may intercede the linkage between ntttg <dig> and ntarf <dig>  and assist ntttg <dig> in transporting ntarf <dig> into the nucleus. testing of this hypothesis will be the subject of future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic analyses indicate that arf <dig>  arf <dig>  and arf <dig> contribute to ntttg2-regulated tobacco growth and development, whereas arf <dig> plays a major role in the process. molecular evidence indicates that arf <dig> is a functional transcriptional activator, whereas the ntttg <dig> protein indirectly regulates the function of ntarf <dig> by modulating its localization to the nucleus. in essence, ntarf <dig> is an integral component of the ntttg <dig> functional pathway that governs the growth and development of tobacco.
