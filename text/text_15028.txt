BACKGROUND
a-to-i rna-editing mediated by adar  enzymes is the major rna-editing that post-transcriptionally modifies nucleotide sequences on rna molecules in metazoans  <cit> . rna-editing can alter protein sequences, influence rna stability and mirna regulations in multiple biological processes including development and carcinogenesis  <cit> . the mammalian adar proteins include adar, adarb <dig>  and adarb <dig>  <cit> .

recent studies have demonstrated that most mice with a null allele of adar died before e <dig> due to defects in the hematopoietic system  <cit> , and most mice with editing deficient adar mutation knock-in died at e <dig>  as a result of unedited transcripts activating interferon and dsrna sensing pathway  <cit> . shtrichman et al.  <cit>  found that editing levels of various target genes are substantially greater in most adult tissues than corresponding fetal ones and that adar protein is substantially regulated in undifferentiated pluripotent hescs. these findings suggest that rna-editing plays important roles in embryogenesis. although early human embryonic transcriptome profiles have been studied , no research on rna-editing activities before blastocyst stage during human embryogenesis has been conducted. to investigate rna-editing activities during early embryogenesis in humans, we profiled the rna editome from  <dig> single cells from  <dig> human embryos ranging from oocyte to morula stages using published human embryonic single cell transcriptome data  <cit> .

RESULTS
characteristics of rna editome during early human embryogenesis
by analyzing  <dig> single cells from  <dig> human embryos spanning from oocyte to morula stages in early embryogenesis  using our rna identification pipeline, we identified  <dig>  candidate rna mismatches, including  <dig>  in alu and  <dig>  in non-alu regions. of the  <dig>  mismatches in alu regions we identified, a-to-g was the most prevalent mismatch type , followed by t-to-c mismatches , of which the majority were thought to be incorrect annotation of a-to-i editing because the rna-seq libraries were not strand-specific  <cit> . the a-to-g and t-to-c mismatches together account for  <dig>  % of the sites identified in alu region . a typical adar-mediated editing is characterized by under-representation of g base in position − <dig> next to the edited site and over-representation of g base in position + <dig> next to the edited site  <cit> . indeed, this characteristic was seen at our identified a-to-g sites and at the complementary strand of t-to-c sites . of the  <dig>  candidate rna editing sites identified in non-alu regions  <dig>  were a-to-g mismatches  and  <dig> were t-to-c mismatches . the proportion of a-to-g/t-to-c mismatches in non-alu regions is smaller than those in alu regions . similar findings have been reported by fumagalli et al.  <cit>  when they studied rna-dna single nucleotide differences  in breast cancer. considering that the proportion of validated rdds was 90 % in alu region and below 40 % outside alu region in their study, and that the majority of editing events are in alu elements in human  <cit> , we only retain non-alu a-to-g mismatches recorded in radar database  <cit>  and alu a-to-g mismatches as candidate a-to-i rna-editing sites in our further analyses.fig.  <dig> characteristics of candidate rna-editings in cells during early human embryogenesis. a percentages of mismatch types in each cell. each column represents one cell. b neighbor preferences for a-to-g  and t-to-c  sites in each cell. a-to-g sites and the complementary strand of t-to-c sites display the motif signature of adar mediated a-to-i editing. each pair of dots and triangles represents the g/c base % at position − <dig>  and + <dig>  in one cell. c percentages of a-to-i rna-editing sites in functional genome elements at different stages. ncrna, noncoding rna. each column represents one cell. d changes in candidate a-to-i rna-editing sites at different stages. each bar represents one cell. o: oocyte; p: pronucleus; z: zygote; 2: 2-cell; 4: 4-cell; 8: 8-cell; m: morula. e rna-editing frequency at each editing site  in each cell . blank regions, uniquely mapped reads <  <dig>  not qualified for rna-editing determination



totally, we identified  <dig>  candidate a-to-i rna-editing sites , of which  <dig>  % located in alu regions and  <dig>  sites were present in the radar database. we annotated a-to-i rna-editing sites and found that the majority were located in 3’-utr regions , followed by intronic , non-coding rna , coding , and 5’-utr regions , respectively . we noticed that the proportion of intronic a-to-i editing sites identified in our study is much smaller than that  in radar database, which may due to the low-coverage of the single cell rna-seq data we analyzed. we will discuss this issue later on.

on average, we detected 819 ±  <dig>  702 ±  <dig>  953 ±  <dig>   <dig>  ±  <dig>  and 743 ±  <dig> a-to-i rna-editing sites in each cell at oocyte, pronucleus, zygote, 2-cell, and 4-cell stages, respectively, whereas in cells at 8-cell and morula stages the a-to-i rna-editing sites sharply dropped to only 190 ±  <dig> and 86 ±  <dig> per cell, respectively . to investigate the changes in rna-editing patterns during human early embryogenesis, we clustered single cells based on editing frequencies , and found that cells at 8-cell and morula stages were clustered together and separated from cells at earlier stages . the heatmap shows that ~15 % of a-to-i rna-editing sites present in cells crossing from oocyte to 4-cell stages, but not in cells at 8-cell and morula stages, despite of expression of transcripts at moderate levels .

a-to-i rna-editing levels are sharply decreased in cells at 8-cell and morula stages
to profile genome-wide a-to-i rna-editing changing patterns in the embryonic development, we defined a-to-i rna-editing level as edited bases per million mapped bases in each cell. under this definition, a-to-i rna-editing levels are not affected by the number of mapped bases .fig.  <dig>

we observed that on average the rna-editing levels remained relatively stable until 4-cell stage, but dramatically decreased  from 4-cell to 8-cell stages , and continually decreased  at morula stage . we then investigated the gene expression of adar, adarb <dig>  and adarb <dig> in cells at different stages, and found that adarb <dig> and adarb <dig> expression remained at low level  across all embryonic stages investigated . the substantially lower expression of adarb <dig> than adar is also seen in many tissues in adult humans   <cit> . amazingly, the changes in adar expression levels were almost in parallel with the changes in editing levels in cells at all stages investigated . correlation tests indicated that rna-editing levels were strongly correlated with adar expression levels . interestingly, we noticed the largest decreases in adar expression level and in a-to-i rna-editing level occurred in the cells at 8-cell stage. it is worth noting that although the adarb <dig> expression levels remained low in cells of all stages investigated, we detected a moderate correlation between the adarb <dig> expression levels and the a-to-i rna-editing levels .

non-synonymous a-to-i rna-editing events frequently occurred in cells before 8-cell stage
we detected  <dig> a-to-i rna editing events at  <dig> non-synonymous sites on  <dig> genes, of which  <dig> non-synonymous a-to-i rna-editing events on  <dig> genes occurred in cells before 8-cell stage . among the  <dig> nonsynonymous sites,  <dig> sites were deposited in radar . in addition, we observed that  <dig> genes were each non-synonymously edited at a specific embryonic stage.fig.  <dig> recoding rna-editing events in cells during early embryonic stages. a heatmap of non-synonymous rna-editing events in cells during early embryonic stages. each row represents a cell, and each column represents a non-synonymous a-to-i editing site. frequently edited genes are highlighted with dashed lines. blank regions, uniquely mapped reads <  <dig>  not qualified for rna-editing determination. b changes in non-synonymous editing frequency are negatively associated with the gene expression of azin <dig>  left, changes in azin1’s editing frequency; middle, changes in azin1’s expression; right, editing frequency is negatively associated with the azin <dig> expression level, each open circle represents one single cell. * p <  <dig> ; ** p <  <dig> ; *** p <  <dig> 



we found that azin <dig>  dcaf <dig>  slc3a <dig>  ttf <dig>  and nsmce <dig> were non-synonymously edited in more than 25 % of cells, almost exclusively confined to stages before 8-cell. previous study showed that the non-synonymous rna-editing sites in azin <dig>  and dcaf <dig>  are clinically relevant in cancers  <cit> . we observed that the a1099g editing events on azin <dig> occurred in  <dig> of  <dig> oocytes,  <dig> of  <dig> pronuclei,  <dig> of  <dig> zygotes,  <dig> of  <dig> 2-cell cells,  <dig> of  <dig> 4-cell cells,  <dig> of  <dig> 8-cell cells and none in morulae cells, respectively, and the a486g editing events on dcaf <dig> occurred in  <dig> of  <dig> oocytes,  <dig> of  <dig> pronuclei,  <dig> of  <dig> zygotes,  <dig> of  <dig> 2-cell cells,  <dig> of  <dig> 4-cell cells, none in  <dig> 8-cell cells and  <dig> of  <dig> morulae cells, respectively. in  <dig> cells, we detected  <dig> non-synonymous a-to-i rna-editing events at three sites  in the extracellular topological domain of slc3a <dig>  which encodes a renal amino acid transporter  <cit> . we found non-synonymous a-to-i rna-editing events at three sites  altering the ttf <dig> c-terminal amino acid sequence, which was suggested to mediate the termination of ribosomal gene transcription  <cit> . in addition, we found non-synonymous a-to-i rna-editing events frequently altered the amino acid sequence of nsmce <dig> , which is required for dna repair  <cit> .

editing frequencies at the exonic rna editing sites of four genes are negatively associated with their expression
we conducted spearman’s correlation analysis between gene expression and editing frequency on  <dig> genes which were edited in the exon regions and found that a-to-i rna-editing frequencies were negatively associated with the expression of four frequently edited genes . for instance, the frequency of non-synonymous editing a1099g on azin <dig> dramatically dropped from 4-cell to 8-cell stages  while the azin <dig> expression substantially increased . we found that azin <dig> expression was highly negatively associated with editing frequency of a1099g . this pattern was also seen in protein coding genes dcaf <dig> , and in long intergenic noncoding rnas rpl23ap <dig>  and snhg <dig>  which was suggested to be associated with cell proliferation  <cit>  .

a-to-i rna-editing events in mirna-targeted mrna regions of many genes preferably occur at specific stages
it has been suggested that rna-editing in mirna-targeted regions could alter mirna-mediated post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit>  and gene expression  <cit> . we identified  <dig> a-to-i rna-editing sites in mirna-targeted regions on  <dig> genes , and noticed that the editing sites are relatively stable in cells from oocyte to 4-cell stages . however, the editing sites in cells at 8-cell and morula stages sharply dropped to 13 ±  <dig> and 4 ±  <dig>  respectively . we noticed that the editing events in mirna-targeted regions on  <dig> genes, enriched in cell cycle , occurred preferably in cells crossing oocyte to 4-cell stages .

in addition to the differences in quantities of editing sites at different stages, a-to-i rna-editing in mirna-targeted regions on a substantial number of genes appears to be stage related. by calculating the percentage of cells with editing events in mirna-targeted regions on each gene at each stage, we found that a group of  <dig> genes were more frequently edited in oocytes than in cells of other stages , whereas a different group of  <dig> genes were more frequently edited in zygotes , and another group of  <dig> genes were more frequently edited in cells at 2-cell stage . interestingly, the number of genes that were more frequently edited in mirna-targeted regions increased to  <dig> in cells at 4-cell stage but suddenly decreased to  <dig> in cells at 8-cell stage . in addition, we observed a small number of genes that were more frequently edited in mirna-targeted regions in cells crossing two sequential stages than other stages. for instance, one group of  <dig> genes were more frequently edited at zygote and 2-cell stages, while another  <dig> genes were more frequently edited at 2-cell and 4-cell stages . we noticed that  <dig> genes involved in generic transcription pathway and  <dig> genes involved in cell cycle, were edited in mirna-targeted regions at most stages . interestingly, nup <dig> and mcm <dig> involved in cell cycle were frequently edited in mirna-targeted regions in cells across zygote to 4-cell stages .fig.  <dig> genes are edited in mirna-targeted mrna regions in a stage-specific fashion. a heatmaps of the percentage of cells edited at each stage  and p-values by fisher’s exact tests  on the number of edited and unedited cells between a specific stage and other stages . vertical bars highlight the genes that are more frequently edited in mirna-targeted regions at one  or two sequential stages  than other stages. arabic numeral denotes the number of genes in each group. b and c heatmaps of the frequencies of cells edited on genes involved in cell cycle and in generic transcription pathway, respectively. each column represents an embryonic stage, and each row represents a gene



discussion
in this study, we detected genome-wide a-to-i rna-editing in cells ranging from oocyte to morula stages, and defined editing-level to reflect rna-editing activities in a cell. we showed that a-to-i rna-editing levels dramatically decreased at 8-cell stage. by looking at the impacts of a-to-i rna-editing on protein recoding, we found that seven genes such as azin <dig> were frequently non-synonymously edited in cells of multiple embryonic stages.

we noticed that the proportion of intronic a-to-i editing sites identified in our study  is much smaller than that  in radar. because introns are retained only in premature mrna of genes, the sequencing depths in intron regions are usually lower than those in exon region of expressed genes in rna-seq. because the single cell rna-seq data we analyzed are low-coverage, thus, the depths of many intronic regions are less than  <dig>  which do not meet our requirement for determination of rna editing events. this leads to a substantial reduction in a-to-i rna editing sites being identified in intron regions, consequently largely reducing the percentage of intronic a-to-i rna editing sites among the total a-to-i rna editing sites identified.

human embryogenesis is a complex and genetically well-programmed developmental process that is controlled by cascades of genes. our results indicated that a-to-i rna-editing acted in a stage-specific fashion during human early embryogenesis. we noticed that genome-wide a-to-i editing level suddenly and dramatically dropped in cells at 8-cell stage, suggesting that this sudden drop of a-to-i rna-editing level may have an important biological significance during human early embryogenesis. although the biological function of this sudden drop of editing level is yet to be discovered, we consider this event particularly interesting. previous studies suggested that the 8-cell stage is a turning point because many important biological events occur at this stage. for example, a recent study on human early embryogenesis showed that there was a dramatic change in gene expression in cells at 8-cell stage as compared to the previous stages. at 8-cell stage, the expression of  <dig> genes, enriched with genes involved in regulation of transcription and regulation of rna metabolic process, substantially up-regulated while  <dig> genes, enriched with genes involved in regulation of transcription and cell cycle, substantially down-regulated  <cit> . the x chromosome inactivation  is an important mechanism that compensates for the difference in gene dosage between xx females and xy males in mammals. interestingly, the xci in humans appears to start from the 8-cell stage  <cit> . moreover, embryonic left-right separation is an important event during embryogenesis of bilaterians. in a recent study, by analyzing multiple lines of molecular and cell biology evidence, ma concluded that embryos of bilaterians are divided into left and right lateral halves at or shortly after 8-cell stage  <cit> .

azin <dig> plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by maintaining polyamine homeostasis within cells  <cit> . a non-synonymous editing  on azin <dig> was found to be conserved in human and mouse  <cit> . previous study showed that the a1099g edited azin <dig> resulted in substantially enhancing cell proliferation in cultured liver cell lines  <cit> . in addition, previous studies showed that the editing frequencies at this site were significantly higher in tumors than in matched nontumorous tissues in hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . besides, azin <dig> expression was significantly increased in esophageal tumors compared with their matched nontumor specimens  <cit> . we observed that a1099g edited azin <dig> are present in  <dig> out of  <dig> cells crossing from oocyte to 4-cell stages, and  <dig> out of  <dig> cells at 8-cell stages. intriguingly, the editing frequency at this site dramatically dropped from 4-cell to 8-cell stage while the azin <dig> expression substantially increased. we found that azin <dig> expression was highly and negatively correlated with the a1099g editing frequencies. as either increase in a1099g editing or high expression of azin <dig> may promote cell proliferation, we speculate that the frequent a1099g editing in earlier stages may be a compensation of the low level of azin <dig> expression. when embryos produce more azin <dig>  a decrease in edited azin <dig> could keep the stability of overall azin <dig> activity. we believe that the underlying biological significance of the frequent a1099g editing on azin <dig> and the function of the a1099g edited azin <dig> during human early embryogenesis requires further investigation. we also believe that the negative association between the azin <dig> expression and the a1099g editing frequencies during early human embryogenesis is particularly interesting, deserving more comprehensive investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our study indicates that human embryos undergo dynamic changes in genome-wide a-to-i rna-editing during human early embryogenesis. our findings underscore the importance of a-to-i rna-editing during early human embryogenesis. it is worth noting that our findings are based on the observation of  <dig> cells from  <dig> embryos across  <dig> embryonic stages. therefore we believe it is necessary to conduct more comprehensive studies to verify our findings and to understand the biological significance of the dynamic changes in a-to-i editing during human early embryogenesis.
