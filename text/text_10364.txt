BACKGROUND
the difficulties in identifying true indels in coding exomes are threefold:  next-generation sequencing  methods are prone to produce indel artifacts  <cit> ,  mapping can be problematic  <cit> , and  low indel density in the coding regions of the genome results in a very low signal to noise ratio   <cit> . many tools and analysis pipeline have been developed for the purpose of identifying indels in ngs data  <cit> . however, previous studies have demonstrated that the different exome variant calling pipelines produce indel call sets with very low concordance   <cit> .

the 1000g aims to provide a comprehensive resource of human genetic variation throughout the world by sequencing the whole genomes  and exomes  of  <dig>  individuals from diverse global populations  <cit> . in phase  <dig> of the project, exome sequencing data of  <dig>  individuals was generated and released. in our study we generated a consensus call of the exome indels from these  <dig>  individuals and characterized the indels in terms of density, allele length and frequency, selection patterns, and mechanisms of mutagenesis.

RESULTS
generating a high quality consensus call set from three different call sets
mapping and indel calling in the  <dig>  exomes from the 1000g  <cit>  were initially performed using multiple pipelines  by three different groups . the different call sets were merged into a union call set with  <dig>  candidate indel loci . next, through our consensus procedure using a random forest model , we identified  <dig>  short  coding indels . this is considered as our consensus call set and based upon for further analysis in this study. the random forest model evaluated the strength of evidence for each individual indel allele based on a series of parameters, e.g. the number of supporting call sets, read-based quality metrics, and the normalized average of the indel qualities reported by the different variant callers . most of these parameters have been reported by the calling pipelines directly in their variant call outputs , making it unnecessary to re-process the original bams when making the consensus call set, rendering the consensus generation procedure very efficient. after the consensus call set i.e. the sites of indel variants were generated, each sample was re-genotyped at each variant site , by going back to the primary sequence alignment  file.table  <dig>

to evaluate the quality of the consensus call set versus the initial union set,  <dig> indels were randomly selected from the union call set  and submitted for pcr roche  <dig> validation . on the basis of the validation results, we estimated an fdr of  <dig> % and 36% for the consensus call set and the union call set respectively . however, the consensus call set lost 14% of the true indels in the union set. on a single-sample level validation of two individuals, we estimated fdrs of  <dig> % and  <dig> % , respectively.figure  <dig> 
validation results at population level for both the initial union call set and the consensus call set. the population validation experiment involved validating  <dig> randomly selected indel sites in up to  <dig> individuals. among the validated loci,  <dig> loci were in our consensus call set. the consensus process lowers the estimated fdr by  <dig> %.



a second validation was also performed confirming the exact loci and alleles of the consensus set indels using the illumina hiseq and miseq platforms at high depth coverage on two individuals. this validation estimated an fdr of  <dig> % and  <dig> % and confirmed over 99% of the true positives from the roche  <dig> validation experiment .

we also compared the consensus call set to the 1000g low-coverage whole-genome phase  <dig> dataset , and found that  <dig> % of the indels we found were novel . this can be attributed to the fact that coding exome indels are predominately rare, with  <dig> % having an alternative allele frequency  less than 1%, and therefore are inaccessible to low coverage sequencing  <cit> . our exome-based consensus indel call set had an average of  <dig>  times more deletions than insertions per- individual exome. in contrast, the deletion to insertion ratio in the 1000g low-coverage dataset was  <dig>   <cit> ; the similar ratios indicate that the surplus of deletions is not due to dna capture issues in the exome data, but more likely due to the difficulty of mapping short reads containing insertions.

negative darwinian selection against coding exome indels
we also observed that selection pressure against coding indels is notably higher than snps, resulting in reduced indel density. we calculated the average variant density per individual , and found an exome indel density of  <dig>  indels per mega-base , which is  <dig> times lower than the exome snp density, and  <dig> times lower than the whole genome indel density calculated from the 1000g phase  <dig> data  <cit> .table  <dig>

average density per individual 
genomic region
for exome indels the consensus set is also compared to the huref and yanhuang call sets. variant density was calculated by dividing the average variants per individual by the size of the analyzed exome target region or non-coding genome as indicated. *the yanhuang exome only includes indels of length  <dig> bp or less.



frameshift indels  are under especially strong scrutiny as they generally result in a nonsense mutation and changes in amino acid sequences. in order to further characterize this effect we evaluated the distribution of indel lengths . in our call set we discovered indels ranging in size from − <dig> to  <dig> base pairs . the vast majority  of the indels are short , and the distribution is strongly enriched for in-frame indels  . short indels were the most frequent with an average of  <dig>   <dig> bp-indels per mb of sequence, and an average of  <dig>  large  indels per mb . at the individual exome level, selection against frameshift indels is even more pronounced, with an average of  <dig>  frameshift indels per mb, and an average of  <dig>  inframe indels per mb. in fact, larger in-frame indels are observed more frequently than shorter frameshift indels. these findings are directly related to the power law of indel mutagenesis and clearly demonstrate selection against frameshift indels.figure  <dig> 
exome indel call set analysis per individual. a. to characterize the exome indel length distribution in individuals we calculated the density of exome indels of different lengths in each individual. shorter indels are generally common with a strong bias towards indel lengths that are a multiple of  <dig> . the indel density for the huref and yanhuang exome are also shown for reference. deletions are shown with negative length. b. to characterize the allele frequency distribution in individuals we calculated the exome indel density in each individual across  <dig> logarithmic allele frequency bins. the results confirm that most of the exome indels in an individual are common , but most individuals harbor a small number of extremely rare exome indels .



we calculated the indel density of each individual across different allele frequencies to characterize the allele frequency spectrum in individuals . the results confirmed that protein coding indels are indeed predominantly common on the individual level, with an individual harboring an average of  <dig>  indels per mb with an allele frequency of 10% or greater,  <dig>  indels per mb with an allele frequency between 1% and 10%, and  <dig>  indels per mb with an allele frequency less than 1%. when comparing the population level distribution of allele frequency on exome indels, low-coverage whole genome snps, and indels and exome snps , we found that the exome indels and frameshift indels in particular are rarer than snps or non-coding indels, with a significantly lower minor allele frequency  

polymerase slippage is the predominant mechanism of exome indel mutagenesis
one of the well-known mechanisms of indel mutations is the occurrence of polymerase slippage during replication which generally results in the expansion or contraction of tandem repeat regions  <cit> . in this analyses, indels related to the mechanism of polymerase slippage are classified as change in copy count  indels, where the smallest repeat motif of the indel represents either an expansion or a contraction of the adjacent reference base or bases . to estimate what proportion of the indels were likely formed through polymerase slippage events, we classified each of the indels as either ccc or not-ccc  .figure  <dig> 
ccc analysis. a. all indels in the analysis we classified as either change in copy count  or not change in copy count  as defined in the figure. b. the ccc vs nccc percent distribution of insertions  and deletions  was calculated at both the population level  and the individuals level . the distributions were also compared against validation results, random simulations , huref, yanhuang, and the human reference genome . c. the counts of ccc vs nccc distribution in insertions and deletions.



we discovered that the majority of indels  in our consensus call set are ccc and therefore likely caused by polymerase slippage. the fdr is expected to be higher in lower-complexity regions, but the low overall fdr  means this is true even if all the fps are ccc. when we further classified the indels into insertion and deletion, we found that the proportions of ccc insertions and deletions were  <dig> % to  <dig> %  respectively. and the fractions of nccc insertion to deletion in the consensus dataset were  <dig> % to  <dig> %, respectively. this represents a seven-fold enrichment of ccc insertion events than nccc insertion events. while insertions are known to be more difficult to map and identify in short-read sequencing data, the nccc insertions are less repetitive and should be easier to discover than ccc insertions. these findings show that polymerase slippage or similar repeat-based events are the mechanism for nearly all insertions.

the prevalence of ccc indels, and ccc insertions in particular, has been observed in a previous study which analyzed ccc indels at the whole genome level  <cit> , but in order to further establish that they are not due to technical or analytical artifacts, we performed this same analysis on the indels from our population validation experiment, the huref  <cit>  and yanhuang  <cit>  exomes, and on randomly generated indel call sets based on the consensus set’s length distribution . the validation experiment, the huref and yan huang analyses all show the same lack of nccc insertions, indicating that the effect is not due to technical or analytical artifacts. the randomly simulated data sets serve as controls to show what is expected to occur by chance for an indel call set with the given length distribution and exome target region.

even the small percentage of nccc insertions  may be explained by complex events with underlying ccc disrupted by snps. if complex events were the majority of nccc insertions, we would expect them to be rarer in population and more prevalent at the individual level. the time for complex events to occur and disrupt the repeat pattern is more recent. we calculated the average number of ccc and nccc indels per individual in the call set and confirmed that the average percent of ccc insertions is indeed higher  than the nccc insertion ratio .

if indeed the nccc insertions were derived from ccc mutagenesis initially, we would also expect nccc insertions to have characteristics  similar to those characteristics of the ccc indels. to test this we calculated the average frameshift rate for ccc and nccc insertions and deletions. for the insertions we confirmed that the nccc frameshift rate is in fact very similar  to ccc insertions , consistent with the hypothesis that most of the nccc insertions were originally ccc insertions. deletions on the other hand had an elevated frameshift rate in nccc deletions . the higher frameshift rate suggests that some mechanism other than polymerase slippage is more likely involved in generating frameshift nccc deletions.

discussion
in this study we have identified  <dig>  coding indels in a diverse global population of  <dig>  individuals. by leveraging the high depth of coverage afforded by exome capture technology we are able to identify more rare variants than is possible through low coverage sequence. using multiple independent indel calling pipelines with machine learning based consensus model algorithm to produce a consensus call set we were able to maximize the consensus call set’s sensitivity and specificity. the validation of  <dig> indels across the population and by individual level demonstrated that the consensus call set is of high quality with an fdr of approximately 7%.

as expected, the consensus call set shows that coding exome indels are under strong selection compared to snps and non-coding indels. this is evident in the overall density where exome indels have a significantly lower density than the other variant types. it is also apparent in the allele frequency distributions, with exome indels having significantly lower mafs than the other variant types. the selection is also apparent at the individual level as there are very few rare  indels in each individual. frameshift indels are clearly shown to be under even greater selection pressure as their density is significantly lower than in-frame indels and the length distribution violates the power law expected for indel mutagenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies have shown that indels more commonly occur in repeat regions or as ccc indels in the human genome, possibly by polymerase slippage mechanism  <cit> . while long repeat regions are rare in the exome, our findings confirm that there is significant enrichment of ccc indels, indicating that polymerase slippage is a primary driver of indel mutagenesis in the human exome. furthermore, our data provides evidence that nearly all exome insertions are the result of polymerase slippage events, including most of the nccc insertions.

one limitation of this study is that the findings are drawn from an indel calling pipeline which was not designed specifically for detection of ccc or repeat region indels. future analysis using variant calling pipelines more specialized for these repeat-based indels  <cit>  will likely reveal additional insights on their mutagenesis and other characteristics.
