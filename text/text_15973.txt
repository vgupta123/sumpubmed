BACKGROUND
rhizobia are a unique group of bacteria which can either exist as free-living organisms in soil or establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with legumes  <cit> . this type of plant–microbe interaction is essential for the functioning of the biosphere, since it provides nutrients to plants and increases soil fertility and field crops. however, before rhizobia can find a compatible host plant, they often must survive long periods of time as free-living bacteria in the soil. in such periods, rhizobial cells are exposed to the action of environmental factors such as nutrient limitation, ph, salinity, drought, temperature variation, heavy metals, and oxidative stress . in order to adapt to these conditions, rhizobia have developed a wide range of strategies and features that allow them to survive in the soil. one of the most important of these adaptations is the composition of the bacterial envelope. the outer surface of these bacteria contains various polysaccharides , such as lipopolysaccharide , capsular polysaccharide  and cellulose fibrils, as well as the neutral polysaccharide  and gel-forming polysaccharide  recently reported in rhizobium leguminosarum . np, cellulose fibrils, and lps are required for attachment to and biofilm formation on soil particles and plant roots, as well as successful infection of the host plant and adaptation to the conditions prevailing inside the nodule, a specific organ formed on legume roots .

in addition, exopolysaccharide , secreted in large amounts by rhizobia and weakly associated with their cells, plays an important protective role against desiccation and other stress conditions occurring in the soil. this polymer is also crucial for the attachment of rhizobia to abiotic as well as biotic surfaces, including plant roots, and establishment of an effective symbiosis  <cit> . another type of ps synthesized by these bacteria is β-glucan, which is found in their periplasmic space and is required for adaptation to hypo-osmotic conditions .

apart from the influence of envelope components, bacterial adaptation to changing soil conditions and interaction with plants are affected by some of the proteins that rhizobia secrete into the environment, including those exported via type i secretion system  . some of these secreted proteins are required for the attachment of rhizobia to host plant roots, which is a very important step in the initiation of symbiosis. an r. leguminosarum protein called rhicadhesin plays a significant role in bacterial attachment to root hairs, particularly at alkaline ph  <cit> . other proteins involved in this process include plyb glycanase , cadherin-like proteins , and rhizobium-adhering proteins  secreted via type i secretion system encoded in r. leguminosarum by the prsd and prse genes  <cit> . moreover, some proteins secreted by rhizobia into the environment allow the bacteria to survive in the absence of their legume hosts. among these, several proteins associated with the uptake of various nutrients have been identified   <cit> .

furthermore, motility of rhizobial cells is an essential trait for their survival in the environment as well as competitiveness . in the soil, the availability of carbon sources utilizable by bacteria is limited, since most components of organic matter form complexes with other compounds, thus becoming resistant to bacterial degradation  <cit> . because of this, the rhizosphere, a narrow soil region rich in various types of substances secreted by plant roots, is a very attractive niche for bacteria  <cit> . therefore, the ability to sense nutrients and move towards them provides a competitive advantage for motile and chemotactic rhizobia over non-motile and non-chemotactic strains  <cit> . several studies have shown that non-motile or non-chemotactic bacteria are less adaptive to changing environmental conditions and less competitive when it comes to plant root infection . additionally, swarming of rhizobial cells is affected by exudates from legume seeds  <cit> .

rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii is a microsymbiont of red clover . previously, rosr encoding a regulatory protein which positively influenced eps production was identified and characterized in this bacterium  <cit> . a mutation in this gene resulted in a significant decrease in eps synthesis  <cit> . r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr belongs to the family of ros/mucr transcriptional regulators, which are involved in the regulation of eps synthesis in several rhizobial species, including sinorhizobium meliloti, rhizobium etli, and agrobacterium tumefaciens . rosr is a small protein  characterized by a cys2his2-type zinc-finger motif, which is responsible for binding to a 22-bp-long sequence called the rosr-box. previously, it was established that rosr recognized the rosr-box motif located in the rosr upstream region and negatively regulated the transcription of its own gene  <cit> . a r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain with a rosr mutation formed dry, wrinkled colonies on agar plates, which were significantly different from those formed by the wild-type bacteria. furthermore, this mutant strain showed some changes in the o-chain of lps. the rosr mutation also resulted in a decreased biofilm formation, a higher sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses, and a significantly impaired symbiosis with clover plants   <cit> . all these data suggest that rosr is an essential protein involved in several cellular processes and, possibly, an important element of the rhizobial regulatory network. although previous results concerning the rosr mutant indicate that rosr is engaged in adaptation to stress conditions, it is still unknown how many genes are under the control of this transcriptional regulator.

in this study, we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii wild-type  <dig>  and its derivative mutant strain rt2472rosr, which provided novel data on rosr-mediated regulation of gene expression in this bacterium. it was found that rosr influenced the expression of a large number of genes, including those related to the synthesis of cell-surface components and polysaccharides, motility, and metabolic pathways. among these genes, a significant majority were up-regulated in the rosr mutant, suggesting that rosr functions in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii cells mainly as a negative regulatory protein.

RESULTS
rna-seq analysis of the wild-type strain rt <dig>  and its derivative rosr mutant rt2472
our previous studies of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr had suggested that this gene could play a global regulatory role in the functioning of rhizobial cells. as a further step in the investigation of this problem, in the present study, we used comparative transcriptomic analysis to establish the set of genes belonging to the rosr regulon. we compared wild-type strain rt <dig>  with its derivative, the rt2472rosr mutant, obtained via random mutagenesis, which has a mini-tn <dig> transposon located inside the rosr coding region, between 151 bp and 152 bp of the open reading frame  <cit> . first, in order to identify the genetic bases of rt <dig>  and to use it as a reference strain to map the sequence reads from the transcriptome data sets, a draft genomic sequence of this strain was obtained . the sequence of rt <dig>  was compared with genomes of closely related rhizobial strains . in total,  <dig>  potential coding sequences were identified in the rt <dig>  genome. among these,  <dig>  sequences  were matched to rhizobium,  <dig>  to other bacterial species, and only  <dig>  were strain-specific and were not matched to any rhizobia.

in order to compare the expression of these genes in the rosr mutant to their expression in the wild-type bacterium, three rna-seq libraries were prepared for the two strains grown in the same conditions. qualitative analyses of rna samples after depletion of 23s and 16s rrna indicated that they were of high quality and that a great majority of rrna had been removed. the mrnas of the rt <dig>  and rt <dig> strains were sequenced using illumina miseq with sbs technology . on average,  <dig> , <dig> reads  for the wild-type strain and  <dig> , <dig> reads  for the rosr mutant were unambiguously mapped. this indicated that similar amounts of data were mapped for each strain. the results were subsequently analyzed using the cuffdiff tool from the cufflinks package to normalize the data and test for differential expression between the strains tested . box plots generated in order to compare the distributions of rna-seq data between biological repetitions of an individual strain and between rt <dig>  and rt <dig> showed similar values for these strains  .

identification of genes differentially expressed in the rosr mutant rt <dig> and the wild-type strain rt <dig> 
an analysis of the functional composition of the rt <dig>  transcriptome showed that the most numerously represented categories were related to metabolism processes, especially the functional groups  g, e, p, and c, which are associated with the transport and metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and inorganic ions as well as energy production and conversion, respectively . also, cog classes k , j , m , and the poorly characterized class r were highly represented in the r. leguminosarum transcriptome.fig.  <dig> genes differentially transcribed in the rosr mutant rt <dig> in relation to the wild-type r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain rt <dig> . a global classification of the genes into up-regulated ones, whose expression was higher, and down-regulated ones, whose expression was lower in the rosr mutant than in the wild-type background. b classification of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes in the rosr mutant into individual functional groups 



in order to establish which genes belonged to the rosr regulon in r. leguminosarum, transcriptional profiles for rt <dig>  and rt <dig> were obtained using the genome-wide rna-seq approach. the high reproducibility between the analyzed strains  and the relative expression values of the rna-seq data allowed us to obtain p-values adjusted with cuffdiff . a histogram of fpkm values  for the genes, with three biological repetitions for each strain analyzed, is presented in additional file 2a. a point diagram of fpkm values between the samples and a diagram indicating the dependence of p-values on fold changes are shown in additional file 2b and c, respectively. based on the fold changes of gene expressions obtained in the rosr mutant and the wild-type strain , it was established that  <dig> genes were transcribed at significantly different levels in these genetic backgrounds. this indicated that rosr influences the expression of many loci and plays an essential role in the rhizobial regulatory network . among the genes in question, a significant majority were up-regulated in the rosr mutant , whereas  <dig>  % were down-regulated , suggesting that rosr functions mainly as a negative regulator of gene transcription in this bacterium. we successfully classified  <dig>  % of the genes into particular cogs   <cit> . most of these genes belonged to the following groups: transcription  , general functions  , unknown function  , transport and metabolism of amino acids   and carbohydrates  , signal transduction mechanisms  , cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis  , and cell motility  . moreover, it was found that for a majority of the cogs  a significantly larger number of the genes were up-regulated than down-regulated in the rosr mutant in relation to the parental strain . in contrast, a great majority of the genes belonging to cogs n and e were expressed at significantly lower levels in the rosr mutant versus the wild-type, indicating that rosr positively affected the transcription of these genes.

when the individual genes belonging to the rosr regulon were analyzed, the highest fold changes in mut/wt expression were found for rt780_ <dig> encoding a periplasmic protein involved in polysaccharide export , rt622_ <dig> and rt622_ <dig> encoding subunits of a cytochrome/quinol oxidase , rt780_ <dig> encoding a glycosyl transferase involved in cell wall biogenesis , rt620_ <dig> encoding a transcriptional regulator from the crp/fnr family , and rt622_ <dig> encoding an adenylate cyclase  . a heatmap for  <dig> genes with the highest fold change values is shown in fig.  <dig>  the characteristics and putative functions of these genes are specified in additional file  <dig> fig.  <dig> representative genes of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii from the individual cog groups differentially expressed in the rt <dig> mutant in relation to the wild-type strain rt <dig> . descriptions of putative functions of the protein products encoded by these genes are given in brackets

transcription factors and signal transduction mechanisms
a functional category that was highly represented in r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii and differentially expressed in the rt <dig> mutant and the parental strain rt <dig>  was transcription  . a significant majority of the genes from this group were up-regulated , with only  <dig> genes being down-regulated in the rosr mutant. these genes encoded transcriptional factors belonging to various families such as crp/fnr, lysr, tetr, lysr, arac, luxr, marr, and gntr. among these proteins, rt782_ <dig> , rt648_ <dig> , rt648_ <dig> , rt620_ <dig> , rt620_ <dig> , and rt646_ <dig>  seem to be the most interesting . the response regulator phob  together with the sensor kinase phor  form a two-component regulatory system used by rhizobial cells to recognize and adapt to phosphate starvation  <cit> . the catabolic protein crp, the rok protein binding crp and camp, the laci protein and the adenylate cyclase rt622_ <dig> are most probably engaged in the regulation of carbon metabolism. rt782_ <dig>  is highly homologous to glnk proteins involved in nitrogen regulation in r. etli and s. meliloti  <cit> , whereas rt646_ <dig> is identical to the luxr-type regulator rair of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae engaged in quorum sensing  <cit> . a transcriptome analysis performed previously for an s. meliloti glnk mutant indicated that glnk, which belongs to p-ii proteins, is an important component of the regulatory cascade involved in nitrogen stress adaptation in rhizobial cells  <cit> . also, several genes encoding luxr-type regulators , which possess a chey-like domain responsible for binding chemotaxis proteins were found in this group .

moreover, many genes from cog t, involved in signal transduction mechanisms, were differentially expressed in the two genetic backgrounds studied, and a majority of them were down-regulated in the rosr mutant . among them, there were several genes coding for methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins , chemotaxis proteins rt628_ <dig>  and rt628_ <dig> , and the response regulator rt628_ <dig> , which seem to play a significant role in signaling. all these data indicate that rosr affects the expression of many genes related to the response of rhizobial cells to environmental conditions  and quorum sensing.

cell motility and chemotaxis
among the functional groups analyzed in this study, cog n is unique because of the fact that a great majority of the genes  associated with cell motility and chemotaxis were down-regulated in the rosr mutant compared to the wild-type strain . this indicated that rosr positively affected this trait in r. leguminosarum. among these genes were those encoding the transcriptional regulator rt634_ <dig> , flagellar biosynthesis proteins  and rt628_ <dig> ), the flagellar motor protein rt634_ <dig> , as well as other flagellar proteins , rt634_ <dig> , and rt634_ <dig> ). moreover, transcription of rt634_ <dig> , rt634_ <dig> , rt634_ <dig> , and rt634_ <dig>  genes encoding flagellins a, b, c, and d, respectively, was significantly decreased in the rosr mutant .

in addition, several genes involved in chemotaxis were down-regulated in the rosr mutant. apart from the mcp-type chemoreceptor genes mentioned earlier, also rt628_ <dig>  rt634_ <dig>  and rt628_ <dig> genes, showing a high homology to chew, ched, and chea, respectively, of r. leguminosarum bv. viciae strains  <dig> and vf <dig> were found in this group  .

previously, tambalo and others  <cit>  had identified two chemotaxis gene clusters  involved in the motility of r. leguminosarum and found that the che <dig> cluster was the major genetic region that controlled swimming and chemotaxis . the first cluster contained such chemotaxis genes as mcpc, chey, chea, chew, cher, cheb, and ched. moreover, flaa, flab, flac, flad, mota, motb, motc, fli, and flg genes, as well as the regulatory genes rem, visr, and visn were located in this region. protein products of flaa, flab, and flac proved to be major components of the flagellar filament  <cit> . as reported earlier, luxr-type regulators visn/visr and the rem protein are components of the regulatory cascade involved in the expression of many flagellar, motility, and chemotaxis genes in r. leguminosarum. a great majority of these genes  are under positive regulation by this cascade  <cit> . in this study, we found that the expression of many of these motility and chemotaxis genes was also positively regulated by rosr, which suggests that this protein may be an important element of this regulatory cascade.

carbon and nitrogen transport and metabolism, and energy production
in the rosr mutant, the expression of a large group of genes related to bacterial metabolism was significantly changed as well . this was especially visible in the case of the genes classified to cogs e , g , and c . many of these genes encoded enzymes and components of various transport systems. in group e, changes in expression were particularly evident in the case of genes encoding two transport systems : the expression of genes rt620_ <dig>  rt620_ <dig>  rt620_ <dig>  and rt620_ <dig> coding for components of the abc-type branched-chain amino acid transport system was strongly up-regulated, whereas transcription of genes rt619_ <dig>  rt619_  <dig>  rt619_ <dig>  and rt619_ <dig> encoding components of the abc-type dipeptide/oligopeptide transport system was down-regulated in the rosr mutant.

similarly in the case of group g, expression of many genes for sugar transport systems was significantly decreased in the mutant background. among them, the most important role seems to be played by rt794_ <dig> and rt794_ <dig> .

in addition, large differences in expression levels between the mutant and the wild-type cells were found for genes encoding different enzymes  .

the differences observed in the expression of group g, e, and c genes suggested large disturbances in the cellular metabolism of the rosr mutant. these results are in agreement with the data obtained previously in biolog tests which indicated that the rosr mutant utilized fewer carbon and nitrogen sources, and some of them utilized less effectively than the parental strain  <cit> .

several authors have reported that the ability to utilize numerous carbon and energy sources plays a very important role in both adaptation of rhizobia to soil conditions and their competitiveness in host plant infection. for example, catabolism of homoserine, a substantial component of pea root exudate, was linked with competiveness for nodulation of this host plant, as evidenced for r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, an inability to catabolize galactose led to an increased ability to compete for nodule occupancy in s. meliloti  <cit> .

cell-surface component synthesis and cell envelope biogenesis
several genes associated with cell envelope biogenesis and synthesis of various polysaccharides and other surface components were differentially expressed in the analyzed strains . in this functional group , high up-regulation in the rosr mutant was established for the following loci: rt780_ <dig> and rt780_ <dig> encoding polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins, and rt780_ <dig> and rt780_ <dig> encoding glycosyl transferases . these genes are located in the same genetic region and are probably engaged in lps biosynthesis. similarly, expression of some genes possibly involved in lps or cell-wall biosynthesis, which are clustered in another genomic region called pss-ii, was highly increased in the mutant background. among these were rt620_ <dig> and rt620_ <dig> coding for glycosyl transferases, and rt620_ <dig> and rt620_ <dig> coding for polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins, homologous to pssy and pssl <dig> of the ta <dig> strain, respectively  <cit> .

in the wild-type rt <dig> , rosr also decreased the expression of rt782_ <dig>  encoding the cyclic β- <dig> -glucan abc transporter ndva, and rt627_ <dig>  which shows a high homology to the rl <dig>  gene involved in gps synthesis in r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> . β- <dig> -glucan is required for adaptation of rhizobia to hypo-osmotic conditions, motility, and efficient symbiosis with host plants, whereas gps is important for attachment to root hairs and competitive nodule infection  <cit> .

in contrast, several genes potentially involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis  and formation of cellulose fibrils , as well as those encoding other glycosyl transferases of unknown functions  were down-regulated in the rosr mutant   <cit> .

previous studies concerning rosr had indicated that this protein was a positive regulator of eps synthesis in r. leguminosarum  <cit> . therefore, we had expected that expression of many of the genes participating in this process, among them a significant majority of those located in the chromosomal cluster named pss-i  <cit> , would be positively affected by this regulator. surprisingly, it was found that only a few of these genes encoding glycosyl transferases , rt772_ <dig> , rt772_ <dig> , and rt620_ <dig> ), were down-regulated in the mutant background, and the level of this regulation was very low  . this finding suggests that the observed levels of regulation of pss gene transcription by rosr are sufficient for proper synthesis of eps in r. leguminosarum. however, it cannot be excluded that rosr exerts a positive influence on the expression of other genes linked with eps synthesis, whose function in this process has not yet been established. previously, we had found that the expression of pssa, which encodes a glycosyl transferase involved in the first step of eps synthesis, was positively regulated by rosr, but the observed effect was not high   <cit> . a similar observation was made for mucr, a positive regulator of succinoglycan synthesis in s. meliloti which shows a significant similarity to the r. leguminosarum rosr; it was established that this protein had an only slight effect on the expression of the genes involved in this process   <cit> .

in summary, the data obtained in this study indicate that rosr regulates the expression of many genes related to the synthesis of various rhizobial polysaccharides. in the wild-type cells, this protein represses the transcription of several genes involved in the biosynthesis of lps, β-glucan, gps and/or cps, while positively regulates the expression of genes which participate in peptidoglycan, cellulose and eps synthesis. all these components play an essential role in the proper functioning of the bacterial envelope and adaptation of the bacteria to environmental conditions  <cit> .

furthermore, rosr proved to be a negative regulator of the expression of several genes from cog m, which encode proteins engaged in the processing of extracellular polysaccharides and in bacterial behavior. among them, the most interesting genes were rt620_ <dig> encoding a  <dig> - <dig> -β-glycanase, rt772_ <dig> encoding component prsd of the type i protein secretion system, rt772_ <dig> coding for an autoaggregation protein, and rt644_ <dig> coding for a protein required for bacterial attachment to host plants . the protein product of the rt772_ <dig> gene exhibited a high homology to rapa <dig> agglutinin of r. leguminosarum bvs. trifolii and viciae, which belongs to the family of rhizobium-adhering proteins   <cit> .

the comparative rna-seq analysis of the rosr mutant and the wild-type strain revealed the role of the rosr protein in several cellular processes. similar results had been obtained for s. meliloti strain  <dig> with a mutation in fadd encoding a long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme a ligase. in this latter strain, more than a thousand genes were identified as differentially expressed, including those for some metabolic activities, chemotaxis, motility, and iron uptake as well as stress-related genes  <cit> . also, an rna-seq analysis of the trai and ngri mutants of s. fredii ngr <dig> had identified a large set of genes which were differentially expressed in comparison to the parental strain   <cit> . these genes included, among others, those related to quorum sensing, motility and eps biosynthesis. these data indicate that mutations in some essential genes in rhizobia may affect the expression of a huge number of other genes involved in various cellular processes.

generation time
it was established in this study that the mutation in rosr did not affect the genome structure or rna processing . however, some genes involved in cell division  were differentially expressed in the analyzed backgrounds . a majority of these genes were down-regulated in the rosr mutant  .

properties of rosr mutant cells
in order to verify the data obtained from the rna-seq analysis, we characterized several traits of the rosr mutant. to do so, in addition to the wild-type rt <dig>  and the rt <dig> mutant strains, rt <dig> after complementation of the mutation by rosr introduced on the prc <dig> plasmid was used. at first, it was established that the rt <dig> mutant grew slower than the rt <dig>  and rt <dig> strains on solid as well as in liquid media. therefore, the doubling time of these strains was determined. in this experiment, it was established that the rosr mutant had a longer generation time  than the wild-type  and the rt <dig>  cells. moreover, rt <dig> growth on agar plates was visible as rough colonies forming clumps, which significantly differed from the mucoid colonies formed by both rt <dig>  and rt <dig>  similarly, in the liquid cultures, rt <dig> showed a tendency to aggregate. it was found that the mutant cells aggregated more effectively than the wild-type cells  =  <dig>  % ±  <dig> ). a more detailed structure of these clumps was established in fluorescent microscopy using gfp-tagged strains . in cultures of rt <dig>  and rt <dig> complementant, single and non-aggregated cells were visible. in contrast, the strain with the rosr mutation formed large aggregates with many grouped cells, which considerably outnumbered the single cells present in the culture. moreover, large amounts of extracellular matrix surrounding the cells inside the clumps were observed. this phenotype could be explained by the increased expression of genes coding for the agglutinin rapa <dig>  prsd of the type i secretion system, as well as glycosyl transferases involved in the synthesis of surface polysaccharides in the mutant cells. previous studies had reported that rapa <dig> is a calcium-binding, cell-surface-associated agglutinin, whose function is to adhere to the root hairs  <cit> . moreover, a positive correlation between bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation had been observed, in which polysaccharides play a significant role  <cit> .fig.  <dig> properties of the rosr mutant rt <dig> in comparison to the wild-type rt <dig>  and rt <dig> strains. a morphology of bacterial cells tagged with the phc <dig> plasmid containing a gusa reporter gene in fluorescence microscopy ; b motility of the analyzed strains determined on  <dig>  % 79ca agar plates in a 3-week experiment; c the cells of rt <dig> , rt <dig> and rt <dig> visualized in transmission electron microscopy 



apart from the differences described above, the rosr mutant showed significantly slower migration on both semi-solid and solid media in relation to both rt <dig>  and rt <dig> . this difference was especially visible on  <dig>  % agar plates after 21 days of incubation. in order to establish whether the motility of this mutant was altered by flagella , cells of the rt <dig>  rt <dig>  and rt <dig> strains were observed in transmission electron microscopy. the wild-type cells were rod-shaped, with an average length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm   =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm), and were peritrichously flagellated with 2– <dig> flagella . moreover, these cells were surrounded by a thick and light layer of extracellular material, which was probably composed of eps . in contrast, the rt <dig> cells were slightly shorter . furthermore, these cells were surrounded by a thinner but more densely packed extracellular layer than in the wild-type. in addition, rosr mutant cells were frequently non-flagellated and sporadically contained 1- <dig> flagella which were significantly shorter than those formed by the wild-type cells. this suggested serious disturbances in flagellum formation and/or function in the rt <dig> strain.

the type of cell flagellation is a strain-specific property, as shown by the fact that r. leguminosarum bv. viciae vf <dig> and s. meliloti  <dig> strains were peritrichously flagellated similarly to rt <dig> , whereas r. leguminosarum bv. viciae  <dig> had subpolar flagella. also, the number of flagella might be strain-specific. for example, strain rl <dig> had 1– <dig> plain subpolar flagella while strain vf <dig> had 4– <dig> peritrichous flagella  <cit> . it had been established that mutations in certain flagellar genes significantly affected rhizobial motility  <cit> . for instance, a mutation in flaa resulted in non-motile vf <dig> cells and extremely reduced the motility of rl <dig> cells, whereas mutations in flab and flac resulted in shorter flagellar filaments, which reduced swimming and swarming motility in the cells of both of these strains. however, mutations in other than motility-related genes could also affect this bacterial trait. for example, a fabf mutant of rl <dig>  deficient in 27-hydroxyoctacosanoate-modified lipopolysaccharide, was impaired in motility, biofilm formation, and desiccation tolerance  <cit> . motility of rhizobial cells is also affected by growth conditions such as agar concentration, inoculum size, temperature, and carbon source  <cit> .

analysis of transcriptional fusions in the rt <dig> and rt <dig>  strains
several r. leguminosarum genes with different expression levels in the wild-type vs. the mutant background , as well as those, whose expression was not affected by rosr , were chosen as representative genes for the experiment designed to validate the data obtained from transcriptomic analysis. the genes in these two groups showed a wide range of promoter strengths . for this analysis, transcriptional fusions containing the promoter regions of these genes upstream of a promoterless lacz were constructed . in addition, plasmids with transcriptional fusions of motility-related genes , kindly provided by prof c. yost from the university of regina  and prof. m. hynes from the university of calgary , were included in the experiment. all these plasmid fusions were introduced into both rt <dig> and rt <dig> , and β-galactosidase or β-glucuronidase activity was measured . based on this analysis, it was found that promoters of the ndva, ndvb, prsd, pssb, cela, gela, rem, visn, flaa, mcpd, and mcpc genes were strong, since their activities in the wild-type strain were higher than  <dig> miller units. in contrast, a few of the studied genes  possessed weak promoters . when β-galactosidase activities for the individual fusions were compared between rt <dig> and rt <dig> , significant differences in the levels of transcription were found for crp <dig>  pssy, rapa <dig>  gela, prsd, ndva, cela , flaa, and rem genes . among them, the highest rt2472/rt <dig>  ratio was found for the following transcriptional fusions: crp1-lacz, pssy-lacz, gela-lacz, rapa1-lacz, and flaa-gusa. on the other hand, similar levels of enzymatic activity in both of the strains tested were established for rfua, ndvb, plya, pssb, noda, rl <dig>  rl <dig>  and ghy, indicating that rosr did not influence the expression of these genes.fig.  <dig> transcriptional activity of rhizobial promoters in the r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii wild-type rt <dig>  and the rosr mutant rt <dig> strains. a β-galactosidase activity of the transcriptional fusions of representative genes encoding regulatory proteins, components of the transport systems, cell-surface components and enzymes for synthesis of polysaccharides; b β-glucuronidase activity of the transcriptional fusions of motility genes. the log <dig> fold changes for the individual genes obtained in the rna-seq analysis are given below the diagrams. genes, for which differences in transcription levels between these backgrounds were not found, are marked with the symbol “-”



in summary, the results obtained from the analysis of transcriptional fusions confirm that rosr is engaged in the regulation of the expression of rapa <dig>  prsd, flaa, crp <dig>  as well as ndva, gela, cela, and pssy involved in the synthesis of various rhizobial ps and other cell-surface components. these data are in conformity with those obtained in the rna-seq analysis. previously, bittinger and handelsman, in their study of r. etli ce <dig>  found that a mutation in a gene homologous to r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii rosr also affected the expression of several genes, including those involved in cellular metabolism  as well as those engaged in the synthesis and modification of polysaccharides   <cit> . rosr of r. etli, similarly to r. leguminosarum rosr, functions as a negative regulator of gene expression, and this protein proved to be essential for nodulation competitiveness of r. etli on bean plants  <cit> .

identification of rosr-box motifs in promoter regions of the genes differentially expressed in the rosr mutant and the wild-type strain
in order to establish which of the large group of genes differentially expressed in the mutant rt <dig> and the wild-type strain rt <dig>  were directly regulated by rosr, additional bioinformatics analyses were performed using a 22-nt-long rosr-box sequence and promoter regions of these genes. sequence motifs showing a significant similarity to the rosr-box were found in the regulatory regions of many of these genes  . selected genes from this group and their rosr-box motifs are shown in table  <dig>  among them, there were genes related to bacterial chemotaxis and motility , rt634_ <dig> , and rt628_ <dig> ), transport and metabolism of carbon and nitrogen sources , and synthesis of cell-surface components and envelope biogenesis , rt620_ <dig>  rt780_ <dig>  rt627_ <dig> , rt772_ <dig> ). moreover, several genes which encode proteins engaged in signal transduction and transcriptional regulators belonging to various families  also possessed rosr-box motifs in their promoter regions. in this group, there were, among others, such genes as rt620_ <dig> , rt648_ <dig> , rt634_ <dig> , rt782_ <dig> , rt646_ <dig> , rt648_ <dig>  and rt628_ <dig> , which are involved in carbon, phosphate and nitrogen regulation, as well as motility and quorum sensing in r. leguminosarum . these data indicate that rosr possibly controls a large group of these genes directly by binding to the sequence motifs located in their regulatory regions. however, in our study, there were many genes in which we did not identify motifs resembling the rosr-box; the expression of these genes may be indirectly regulated by rosr . among the transcriptional regulators of r. leguminosarum mentioned above, the activator rem, which together with luxr-type regulators visn and visr positively controls the expression of many motility and chemotaxis genes, seems to be an interesting example of this relationship . besides direct regulation of the transcription of several cog n genes, rosr was also found to indirectly affect the expression of some motility genes by modulating rem expression. thus, rosr could be an important element of a second regulatory system controlling the expression of motility genes that are not under the control of the visn/visr-rem regulatory cascade. the existence of such a system in r. leguminosarum was previously postulated by tambalo and colleagues  <cit> .table  <dig> sequence motifs identified in regulatory regions of the genes differentially expressed in the rosr mutant and the wild-type strain, which show a significant similarity to the rosr-box sequence

aidentity of sequence motifs to the rosr-box was determined using 22-nt long sequences with the exception of their  <dig> nt in the middle of the sequence



another possibility is that rosr regulates some genes of the rosr regulon, for which rosr-box motifs were not found in our study, by acting together with another regulatory protein, as evidenced for the rosr homolog in s. meliloti, mucr  <cit> . mucr single-handedly regulates the expression of many genes related to the synthesis of succinoglycan and the nod factor, cell motility, and nitrogen fixation , and in a complex with wggr  is involved in the regulation of galactoglucan synthesis genes .

in summary, data presented in this study suggest that rosr, similarly to s. meliloti mucr, plays an essential role in the regulatory network in r. leguminosarum, linking regulatory cascades associated with various environmental factors.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we performed transcriptome profiling of the rosr mutant of r. leguminosarum bv. trifolii strain  <dig>  using the next-generation rna-seq technology. this analysis allowed us to identify a large set of genes linked to motility, synthesis of cell-surface components, and several metabolic pathways, whose expression was affected by the rosr mutation. it was established that rosr is a global transcriptional regulator, which functions mainly as a repressor and is involved in several cellular processes. on the other hand, this protein is engaged in the positive regulation of many motility-related genes. the data presented in this study expand our knowledge of the role of rosr in the functioning of r. leguminosarum cells and provide insight into the regulatory network of this bacterium. moreover, our study confirms the observation that the rosr mutation significantly affects the behavior of bacterial cells, as evidenced by their altered morphology, flagellation, motility, and aggregation ability.
