BACKGROUND
cotton  is the world's most important fiber crop plant. while most of the >  <dig> gossypium species are diploid , five are allopolyploids , originating from an interspecific hybridization event between a- and d-genome diploid species. humans have independently domesticated four different species for their fiber, two of which are diploids, gossypium herbaceum and g. arboreum, and two are allopolyploids, g. hirsutum and g. barbadense  <cit> .

alhough g. hirsutum and g. barbadense probably originated from a single hybridization event between a- and d- diploid species, the two have very different agronomic and fiber quality characteristics. the high yield potential and diverse environmental and production system adaptability of g. hirsutum make it the most widely cultivated species, accounting for about 97% of the world's cotton fiber  <cit> . g. barbadense is a more modern species possessing superior fiber quality. novel alleles are responsible for the improved fiber quality in g. barbadense. despite its higher fiber quality, however, the narrow adaptation range and low yield of g. barbadense limit its cultivation. the two gossypium species are sexually compatible, although partial sterility, longer maturity, and hybrid breakdown are often observed in later generations  <cit> . nonetheless, the introgression of favorable alleles from g. barbadense to g. hirsutum would likely improve the fiber quality of g. hirsutum while simultaneously maintaining its high fiber yield  <cit> .

the cotton fiber is a single cell without the complex cell division and multicellular development that develops from ovule's epidermal cells. fiber development occurs in four distinct, but overlapping stages: initiation, elongation, secondary wall synthesis, and maturation  <cit> . to date, many of the genes predominantly expressed in cotton fiber development have been isolated and characterized. gh14-3-3l was found to be predominantly expressed during early fiber development, and may be involved in regulating fiber elongation  <cit> . yoder et al.  <cit>  defined pectate lyase  as a cell wall modification enzyme. ghpel was found to play an essential role in fiber cell elongation by degradation of the de-esterified pectin for cell wall loosening  <cit> . ruan et al.  <cit>  suggested the sucrose synthase gene  played an important role in the initiation and elongation of single-celled fibers by inﬂuencing carbon partitioning to cellulose synthesis. ghbg , one of three cellulases, was specifically expressed in fiber cells and plays an important role in degradation of the primary cell wall and promotion of secondary cell wall synthesis  <cit> . cotton cela <dig> and cela <dig> genes, encoding the catalytic subunit of cellulose synthase, are expressed at high levels during active secondary wall cellulose synthesis in developing cotton fibers  <cit> . two cotton rac genes, ghraca and ghracb, expressed in the fibers at the initiation and elongation stages, might play an important role in early fiber development  <cit> . in addition, several genes are expressed specifically or preferentially in fibers  <cit> , although their exact functional roles remain unclear.

in theory, there are two homologs in tetraploid cotton species, representing descendants from the a-genome and d-genome donors at the time of polyploidy formation. the goals of this study were to: 1) better understand the genetic basis of cotton fiber development, 2) identify the structural difference of duplicated genes, and 3) reveal the expression and evolution of fiber quality differences between upland and sea-island cotton. to complete this study, we selected  <dig> fiber development genes accessioned in national center for biotechnology information  to study structure and expression differences of the two cultivated tetraploid species. to investigate their frame and sequence divergence, we initially cloned these genes in the genome dna of the g. hirsutum accession tm- <dig>  the g. barbadense cultivar hai <dig>  and their two putative diploid progenitors. the chromosomal locations of each homeolog of several studied genes, having effective single nucleotide polymorphism  or amplification polymorphism loci between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> were determined by linkage analysis in allotetraploid cotton using an interspecific bc <dig> mapping population ×tm-1]  <cit> . finally, expression patterns of each gene and each homeolog were explored. a more thorough understanding of interspecific divergence of cotton will provide a solid foundation from which key fiber quality genes may be exploited in cotton molecular breeding.

RESULTS
sequence and structure analysis of fiber development genes
the orthologs of each of the  <dig> genes were cloned and sequenced . phylogenetic groupings and sequence comparisons allowed the copy number for all genes, except exp <dig> in the hai <dig> cultivar, to be independently isolated with a single copy from the diploid species and two homeologs from each tetraploid species for each gene. there was a single copy of exp <dig> in the diploid species and two distinct copies in tm- <dig>  however, the exp <dig> sequence from hai <dig> was of only one type, though more than  <dig> clones were selected randomly to sequence. this result was further validated by a different primer pair of this gene . the sequence from hai <dig> has a closer relationship with g. raimondii than with g. herbaceum. further, southern blotting of exp <dig> performed on the four species, showed two distinct hybridizing bands after digestion with ecori and hindi in hai <dig> and tm- <dig>  and one hybridizing band in g. herbaceum and g. raimondii , which indicated that exp <dig> had two copies in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  combining sequence and southern blot analysis, the homeolog of exp <dig> in the a-subgenome of hai <dig> was colonized to a type resembling that of the d-subgenome via nonreciprocal homoeologous exchange  <cit> .

the lengths of the genomic dna sequences isolated from the four species varied from  <dig> bp  to  <dig> bp  . based on the alignments between the genomic dna and the cdna sequences in orthologs, twelve genes  shared the same intron/exon structures in different genomes, and variations in length were mainly caused by insertion/deletion events within introns . the remaining five genes , cipk <dig>  cap, bg, mana <dig> and cela <dig>  produced some structure differences caused by different exon length or numbers .

a <dig> = g. herbaceum l. var. africanum, d <dig> = g. raimondii ulbr, ath = a subgenome of g. hirsutum l. acc. tm- <dig>  dth = d subgenome of g. hirsutum l. acc. tm- <dig>  atb = a subgenome of g. barbadense l. cv.  <dig>  dtb = d subgenome of g. barbadense l. cv.  <dig> 

seventeen gene trees were constructed using the nj method to distinguish the duplicated genes independent of evolution or local interlocus recombination after tetraploid formation. two major clades, one including g. herbaceum and the a-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  the other including g. raimondii and the d-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  were formed for  <dig> genes . high bootstrap values supported duplicated genes independent of evolution after tetraploid formation. two genes were determined to have local interlocus recombination or colonization after tetraploid formation . act <dig> from g. raimondii was more closely related to act1s from g. herbaceum and the a-subgenomes than with act1s from the d-subgenomes. this relationship suggests that act1s from the d-subgenomes evolved at an accelerated rate, relative to act1s from the a-subgenomes. the exp <dig> sequence in hai <dig> was closer to that found in g. raimondii.

to locate all  <dig> homeolog gene pairs on our backbone genetic map  <cit> , the subgenome-specific pcr primers  and single-nucleotide amplified polymorphisms  primers  were used to detect polymorphisms between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  polymorphic primer pairs were also used to survey  <dig> individuals of the ×tm-1]) bc <dig> mapping population . eight gene pairs were located on their corresponding homeologous chromosomes, and each of six pairs were located on one of their homeologous chromosomes, while three pair of genes, exp, exp <dig> and cela <dig> could not be mapped because no available polymorphic loci were found between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  a large body of data was compiled by integrating previously reported cotton fiber quality quantitative trait locus  <cit>  with the  <dig> identified fiber quality-related genes within  <dig> cm. most genes had at least one fiber quality qtl; some had several , indicating important fiber quality roles.

rates of sequence evolution
with only a few exceptions, purifying selection, as indicated by ka/ks <  <dig>  appears to be in place for most of pairwise comparisons . the exceptions include g. herbaceum  vs g. hirsutum a-subgenome  of pod <dig> and d <dig> vs dth of raca, which demonstrated positive selection , as well as d <dig> vs dtb of raca, a <dig> vs atb of 14-3-3l, a <dig> vs ath and a <dig> vs atb of cap, which had exceptionally strong positive selection .

letter designations are the same as in table  <dig> 

a no synonymous and nonsynonymous site.

because there were no nucleotide substitutions in a <dig> vs atb of raca, a <dig> vs atb of exp, d <dig> vs dth and d <dig> vs dtb of ltp <dig>  and all racbs pairs, it was not possible to compare their evolutionary rates. although those particular "not applicable" comparisons  were excluded from our analysis, the "nas" were considered zero when they were compared with others whose ks were not na. in all pairwise comparisons of nucleotide diversity for each gene between subgenomes within a species ,  <dig> %  had a higher evolutionary rate in the d-subgenome than in the a-subgenome. furthermore, in the  <dig> gene pairs  from the a-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig>   <dig> %  had a higher evolutionary rate in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>   <dig> %  and were reversed and  <dig> %  showed an equivalent evolutionary rate between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  similarly, in the  <dig> gene pairs  from the d-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  60%  had a higher evolutionary rate in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>   <dig> %  and were reversed and  <dig> %  showed an equivalent evolutionary rate between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> 

phylogenetic relationships are reflected in the nucleotide substitution results . based on branch length, all of homeologs from the two tetraploid species had unequal rates of sequence evolution following allopolyploid formation. the rates at which the deviations occurred in allopolyploids are sufficient to generate branch length inequality between the a- and d-subgenomes  <cit> .

ka/ks ratio comparisons showed that selection had altered the molecular evolutionary rate of some genes due to allopolyploid formation. four genes, pel, raca, exp and sus <dig>  in tm- <dig>  and five genes, pel, cipk <dig>  14-3-3l, cap and cela <dig>  in hai <dig>  yielded higher ka/ks ratios in a-at, d-dt and at-dt comparisons than in the a-d comparison, indicating that selection for some genes related with fiber development had acted at the tetraploid level.

differential expression fiber development genes
after the specificity of homeolog-specific primer pairs were confirmed by pcr amplification of genomic dna from g. herbaceum , g. raimondii , tm- <dig> and hai <dig> , their homeolog transcripts in young tetraploid cotton fiber were further detected by qpcr analysis. the relative expression values at  <dig> different fiber development stages were obtained by combining the homeolog transcripts of each gene at the same stage. expression for the  <dig> genes could be broken down into five categories : 1) fiber initiation and early elongation , such as exp, pod <dig> and mana <dig> ; 2) fiber elongation , such as exp <dig>  pel, and ltp <dig> ; 3) primary-secondary transition period , such as bg, cel and cela <dig> ; 4) both at fiber initiation and early elongation period  and secondary cell wall thickening period , such as sus <dig>  14-3-3l and racb ; 5) the whole fiber developmental period, such as cela <dig>  cap, act <dig>  raca and cipk <dig> . in the last category, however, transcript preference was shown at some stages. for example, cela <dig> and cap were expressed preferentially at the fiber elongation and secondary cell wall thickening stages , but had moderate expression at 0- <dig> dpa.

gene expression differences in tm- <dig> and hai <dig> were further clarified by statistical analysis of least signification difference . greater expression in hai <dig> than in tm- <dig> was observed for 14-3-3l except at  <dig> dpa, and for cela <dig> except at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa. other gene transcripts showed different expression advantages in the two cotton species at various fiber developmental stages.

at fiber initiation and early elongation , most genes, including exp, mana <dig>  sus <dig>  racb, cela <dig>  cap and raca, had significantly higher expression levels in hai <dig> than in tm- <dig>  during fiber elongation , the expression profiles of genes preferentially expressed during that period were either biased to tm- <dig> or hai <dig> or were equally expressed between the two. five genes, exp <dig>  pel, cap, cipk <dig> and raca, were expressed preferentially in tm- <dig> or equally between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  except at  <dig> dpa, that these same genes showed significantly greater expression levels in hai7124; ltp <dig> and act <dig> showed significantly higher expression levels in tm- <dig> than in hai7124; expression of cela <dig> was higher in hai <dig> 

during primary-secondary cell wall transition , peak expression occurred earlier in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig> for most genes . act <dig> and raca expressed equally in tm- <dig> and hai <dig> at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, but significantly greater in hai <dig> at  <dig> dpa. the extended fiber development period, as indicated by higher expression at a later dpa, may help explain why g. barbadense has an extra long staple cotton. one gene, cela <dig>  showed no significant expression difference between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> 

genome-specific expression of the homeologs
based on the homeolog expression profile,  <dig> diagnostic genes in tm- <dig> and  <dig> in hai <dig> were further evaluated. of the  <dig> genes,  <dig> %  were equally expressed between the a- and d-subgenomes,  <dig> %  were a-subgenome biased,  <dig> %  were d-subgenome biased and  <dig> %  were a- or d-biased at different stages.

the  <dig> fiber development genes were clustered into three comparison patterns between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  first, homeologs for cela <dig>  exp, exp <dig> and cipk <dig> in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig> were equally expressed between the a- and d-subgenomes in the preferentially-expressed stages . of these, exp <dig> had equal transcript levels from the two homeologs in tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  with two distinguishable copies in tm- <dig> and two undistinguishable copies in hai <dig>  these data were consistent with the fact that the duplicated loci for exp <dig> in hai <dig> had the same sequence as the d-subgenome .

second, the transcripts of  <dig> genes, cel, pel, sus <dig>  14-3-3l, raca, cela <dig>  mana <dig>  racb, cap, ltp <dig> and pod <dig>  were a- or d-subgenome biased . among these, cel, pel, sus <dig>  14-3-3l and raca were a-subgenome biased and cela <dig>  mana <dig> and racb were d-subgenome biased in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig> at all stages. the transcripts of the homeologs of cap, ltp <dig> and pod <dig> were significantly altered in the preferentially expressed stages in tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  in tm- <dig>  the transcripts of cap and ltp <dig> were significantly a-subgenome biased. however, the transcripts of the two genes in hai <dig> were equivalently expressed at most stages, only d-subgenome bias in ltp <dig> in the primary-secondary cell wall transition period detected. expression of pod <dig> was a-subgenome biased at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa and d-subgenome biased at  <dig> dpa in tm- <dig>  in hai <dig>  pod <dig> expression was a-subgenome biased at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa and d-subgenome biased at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa.

third, bg was significantly  affected only from the a-subgenome, and act <dig> was significantly  affected from the d-subgenome at all stages in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig> . based on the comparison patterns and the structural analysis of the two genes, we proposed that the homeolog of bg from the d-subgenome might be silenced and that of act <dig> from the a-subgenome may have novel roles in other species .

differences between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> in transcriptome contributions of the subgenome at key fiber developmental stages were detected. during initiation and early elongation of the fiber,  <dig> gene transcriptions showed greater expression levels in hai <dig> than in tm- <dig>  of those, the d-subgenome contributed higher amounts of act <dig>  racb and man <dig>  while the a-subgenome contributed higher amounts of sus <dig>  cipk <dig> and 14-3-3l. cela <dig>  exp, cap and raca were equally supplied by both subgenomes.

at  <dig> dpa, corresponding to the close of fiber plasmodesmate  <cit> , the transcriptions of  <dig> genes  were sharply accumulated in hai <dig>  of those, the transcripts of racb and pod <dig> were contributed mainly from d-subgenome, that of bg, pel, sus <dig> and raca from a-subgenome and others by both a- and d-subgenomes.

at the primary-secondary transition period, the expression of  <dig> genes, cela <dig>  cap, act <dig>  raca, cipk <dig>  14-3-3l, sus <dig>  racb, cel and bg, occurred earlier in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>  the transcripts of act <dig> and racb were mainly from d-subgenomes; those of bg, cel and sus <dig> were mainly from a-subgenomes, and other genes were from both a- and d-subgenomes. based on these data we inferred that the expression accumulation of the a-subgenome, or the combination of a- and d-subgenomes, played critical roles in fiber quality divergence of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. however, the expression of d-subgenome alone also played an important role.

discussion
evolutionary fate of duplicated genes
for each gene that was studied, allopolyploid species should have two homelogs, representing descendants from the a-genome and d-genome donors at the time of polyploidy formation. cronn et al.  <cit>  indicated that most duplicated genes in allopolyploid cotton evolved independently of each other. our phylogenetic analyses support this hypothesis, and the independent evolution of several genes was distinctively evident in their structure, in our study. for example, caps and racbs had the same structure between each diploid and its counterpart in allopolyploid cotton , but the different structures were apparent in the a-d comparison . though expression of mana <dig> from the at-subgenome of hai <dig> ceased rather early in the growth process, the structure difference between the a-, at-subgenomes and d-, dt-subgenomes was also distinct. the fact that the structure of the at- and dt-subgenomes mirrored their putative ancestral diploid species suggested the difference may have occurred before allopolyploid formation and evolved independently in allopolyploid cotton. cela3s from at-subgenome of tm- <dig> and hai <dig> displayed the same mutation, which altered their coding regions, indicating not only independent evolution, but also parallel evolution between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  this change, however, was not detected in their putative ancestral diploid species, suggesting accelerated evolution of cela <dig> in the at-subgenome after allopolyploid formation. though most genes independently evolved in allopolyploid cotton, there were some exceptions. for example, exp <dig> from at-subgenome were colonized in hai <dig> by dt-subgenomes.

relative to expression, duplicate genes can follow one of three evolutionary paths. first, one copy may evolve into a nonfunctional pseudogene  <cit> . second, the multiple copies can contribute to an increase in the gene expression level  <cit>  or both copies can suffer mutations but the combined action of both gene copies is necessary to maintain original function and expression levels   <cit> . third, one copy may gain a novel beneficial function  that is selectively maintained within the genome  <cit> . we measured homeolog-specific contributions to the transcriptome in allopolyploid cotton fiber by q-pcr analysis. because the majority  of diagnostic genes exhibited subgenome-specific bias to the a or d-subgenome, subgenome-biased expression in cotton fiber developmental stages was considered commonplace. this result was consistent with previous studies  <cit> . most of genes in our study exhibited the same expression bias in the two cultivated cotton species, tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  however, some inconsistencies were detected in three genes , suggesting that these genes may have had different roles in the interspecific divergence between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense. artificial selection by humans of certain desirable fiber traits may have also influenced g. hirsutum and g. barbadense genetic structure  <cit> .

synthesizing structures and expression profiles of the duplicates, their possible fates are inferred. bg accumulated solely in a-subgenome transcripts , in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig> . bgs obtained from the d-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig> had a nucleotide deletion and a nonsense mutation, respectively, which altered the orfs . the structure difference suggests that bg in the d-subgenomes of tm- <dig> and hai <dig> may be pseudogenes. on the other hand, while cap and cela <dig> had different a- and d-subgenome structures in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig> , their a- and d-subgenome expression profiles were active . therefore, the duplicated genes of cap and cela <dig> may be subfunctionalized. similarly, the functions of duplicated genes from cel, sus <dig>  14-3-3l, raca, racb, exp, exp <dig>  cipk <dig>  cela <dig>  pel, mana <dig>  ltp <dig> and pod <dig> were also subfunctionalized . because act <dig> transcripts of a subgenomes could not be detected at all stages of fiber development , they may have evolved new functions.

domestication of allopolyploid cotton
numerous plant species have been selectively bred over the course of human social evolution  <cit> . allopolyploid cotton species are believed to have formed about 1- <dig> million years ago, by hybridization between a maternal old world diploid a-genome g. herbaceum  <cit>  and paternal new world diploid d-genome g. raimondii  <cit> . the allotetraploid lineage gave rise to five extant tetraploid species, including g. barbadense and g. hirsutum, known for their superior fiber quality and high yield, respectively. in the present study, the ka/ks ratios among four cotton species indicated that selection of fiber development genes occurred at the tetraploid level. by comparing the nucleotide diversity between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> within the same subgenome, most genes  had a higher evolutionary rate in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>  which may be associated with longer and more frequent cultivation of tm- <dig>  given these data, we propose that diversity evolution between a- and d-subgenomes within a species or between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> within the same subgenome was due to both natural and artificial selection pressure  <cit> .

gene expression differences between tm- <dig> and hai7124
g. hirsutum and g. barbadense are two domesticated cotton species possessing very different agronomic and fiber quality characteristics with g. barbadense having superior fiber quality. rapp et al.  studied the transcriptomes of cotton fibers from wild and domesticated accessions  and found that human selection during the initial domestication and subsequent crop improvement had resulted in a biased upregulation of components of the transcriptional network during fiber development  <cit> . in this study, of the  <dig> fiber development-related genes,  <dig> had the similar expression pattern and three that did not, in tm- <dig> and hai <dig> . of three genes, the transcripts of homeologs were significantly a- or d-subgenome biased in tm- <dig>  however, in hai <dig>  homeolog transcripts were equally expressed between the two subgenomes or d-subgenome biased. though  <dig> genes had the same expression patterns between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  the relative expression levels were different at most stages. while the same a- or d-biased or equal expression profile in the two cultivated cotton species might be related to functional partitioning of genomic contributions during cellular development after allopolyploid formation, significant alternation of homoelog a/d ratio and expression difference at the same fiber developmental time points between g. hirsutum and g. barbadense indicated that domestication for different fiber qualities may play an important role in fiber quality divergence of g. hirsutum and g. barbadense.

in previous study, fiber growth curves have shown longer fiber elongation phases in domesticated g. hirsutum than that in wild g. hirsutum, and further comparative gene expression profiling of isolated cotton fibers over a developmental time course of fiber differentiation indicated that domesticated tm- <dig> displayed a much higher level of transcriptional variation between the sampled time points than the wild accession did  <cit> . in the study, the expression peak of transcripts in most genes was earlier in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>  especially at the primary-secondary transition period, which indicated that most genes related to fiber development expressed longer and more intensely in hai <dig>  resulting differences in mrna levels may lead to changes in enzyme activity, further contributing to phenotypic differences between the two cotton species. several genes that are differentially expressed in tm- <dig> and hai <dig> should be further mined.

the 14-3- <dig> protein is an important regulatory protein. shi et al.  <cit>  proposed that the gh14-3-3l transcripts are highly accumulated during early cotton fiber development, suggesting that gh14-3-3l may be involved in regulating fiber elongation. our data showed that, although 14-3-3l is expressed preferentially in the early development stages of cotton fibers in both tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  the relative expression values were significantly different. the expression of 14-3-3l was significantly higher in most stages in hai <dig> , than in tm- <dig>  furthermore in the primary-secondary transition period of fiber development, a secondary expression peak of 14-3-3l was also detected, indicating 14-3-3l may also be involved in thickening of the secondary cell wall, a function that has been reported in other species  <cit> . at  <dig> dpa, the expression of 14-3-3l decreased in tm- <dig>  but was still increasing in hai <dig>  suggesting a longer transcriptional period.

cela <dig> was solely expressed during secondary wall cellulose synthesis, with no significant expression difference between tm- <dig> and hai <dig> . the importance of cela genes in secondary wall cellulose synthesis in developing cotton fibers has been reported by other researchers  <cit> . expression of cela <dig> at  <dig> dpa was significantly higher in tm- <dig> than in hai <dig>  however, strength dropped much faster in tm- <dig>  than in hai <dig> after that, which more stable expression was detected over a longer period of time in hai <dig> 

rac genes  are involved in various physiological processes, including cell polar growth  <cit> , synthesis of the secondary wall  <cit> , resistance response  <cit>  and signal transduction  <cit> . in the present study, racas were predominantly expressed at the fiber elongation and secondary wall synthesis stages , indicating that the role of raca may be similar to that of rac <dig>  which is involved in the signal transduction pathway for cytoskeleton organization  <cit> . similarly, racb was predominantly expressed at the secondary wall synthesis stage in tm- <dig>  and preferentially expressed at the initiation of fiber development and secondary wall synthesis in hai <dig> , suggesting multiple roles for racb. because raca and racb expressions were consistently higher at most stages in hai <dig> relative to tm- <dig>  the two genes may be contributing to fiber quality diversity.

sucrose synthase  affects initiation and elongation of the single-celled fibers, and also has a major role in cell wall cellulose synthesis  <cit> . cotton fiber cell initiation and elongation are very sensitive to changes in sus activity  <cit> . the expression peak of cotton sucrose synthase genes transcripts was earlier in wild cotton than in tm- <dig> <cit> . our study showed that greater sus <dig> expression in hai <dig> than in tm- <dig> at initiation  and  <dig> dpa and at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa was reversed. at  <dig> dpa, sus <dig> expression was significantly higher in tm- <dig>  possibly as a result of earlier termination of fiber elongation and earlier initiation of cell wall synthesis in tm- <dig> 

recent studies of comparative gene expression profiling of isolated cotton fibers  <cit>  have identified genes controlling differences in fiber growth between wild and domesticated cotton . these studies will provide new clues in the future studies to better understand the interspecific divergence of fiber development in the two cultivated tetraploid cotton species, g. barbadense and g. hirsutum.

putative role of d-subgenome in interspecific divergence
most genes  exhibited a higher evolutionary rate in the d-subgenome than in the a-subgenome, indicating that the d-subgenome of the allotetraploid evolved faster than the a-subgenome  <cit> . considering the weight of evidence provided by genome-specific expression of homeologs, chromosome location of genes and qtl distribution for fiber qualities , we also determined the subgenome transcriptome contribution in interspecific divergence between tm- <dig> and hai <dig>  in the integration interval of genes and qtls, the gene transcripts were significantly a-subgenome biased, and the qtls associated with fiber qualities were detected in corresponding a-subgenome chromosome bins. similarly, the gene transcripts were significantly d-subgenome biased and relative fiber qtls were detected in corresponding d-subgenome chromosome bins. while the transcripts of cap was significantly a-subgenome biased in tm- <dig>  but equally expressed in hai <dig> in the fiber developmental period, implying an important d-subgenome contribution for elite fiber quality traits in hai <dig>  integration of cap duplicated loci with fiber length and strength qtls in d <dig>  indicates domestication and artificial selection of tetraploid plants for superior fiber quality resulted in more significant evolutionary dynamics in the d-subgenome than in the a-subgenome.

CONCLUSIONS
the study provided us the systematic report on the interspecific divergence for fiber development between gossypium barbadense and g. hirsutum by analyzing structures, molecular evolution and transcripts levels of fiber development-related genes. the results indicated that selective breeding for certain desirable fiber qualities may have played an important role in divergence of the two cultivated tetraploid cotton species.
