BACKGROUND
cellular remodeling of the ecm is a critical factor in wound healing, developmental biology, metastasis of tumor cells, and diseases such as hypertension  <cit> . the study of cell-matrix dynamics and cellular remodeling of the ecm is challenging, and has involved the use of fluorophores, including fluorescent fusion proteins  <cit> , often using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy   <cit> . we show here that as an alternative, spri can be a sensitive, label-free, and low-light optical method that eliminates the requirement for modified biological molecules and transfected cells, and allows for highly sensitive real-time observation of protein deposition and live cell engagement with the ecm.

surface plasmon resonance  occurs when light energy couples into the electromagnetic field at a metal-coated surface. the reflectivity of the incident light is inverse to the extent of plasmon resonance, and is determined by the identity and the thickness of the metal layer, the angle of incidence, the wavelength of the incident light, and the refractive index of the medium at the interface. because the refractive index is proportional to the amount of adsorbate at the surface  <cit> , spr has been used as a quantitative, sensitive, and label-free technique for measuring the binding kinetics of proteins  <cit> , dna  <cit> , and small molecules  <cit> , to surface immobilized capture agents. using spr in an imaging mode, high throughput analysis of proteins and dna has also been demonstrated  <cit> . spr imaging has not previously been considered a useful technique for imaging cell features, largely because of previous assumptions that poor spatial resolution would prevent useful imaging.

in this report, we demonstrate that spri contrast allows sensitive measurement of cell-substrate interactions and mass changes at the substrate interface. spri allows quantification of cell secreted and deposited material by observing changes in surface protein mass/area as a function of time and location. we use spri to observe the initial surface preparation by monitoring the deposition of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin which serves as the substrate for the cell based measurements. by using different incident wavelengths and image processing routines for spri, it is possible to tune the spri measurement for sensitivity versus spatial resolution to suit each step of the experiment. in this report, we demonstrate that spri is a sensitive interfacial technique that is able to bridge the gap between molecular  and cellular  measurements.

RESULTS
spri apparatus and resolution
the spri apparatus is described schematically in figure 1a. the optical design is fundamentally similar to existing spri instruments  <cit> , however, the specific configuration is designed to make long term live cell based measurements. by positioning the spr sensor surface horizontally, incident light is launched from below the sample into a gold-coated sf- <dig> glass slide which comprises the cell culture surface of an enclosed chamber. this configuration allows cells to be added into the chamber and imaged on the substrate, and facilitates transfer of the cell chamber between the spr imaging apparatus and an inverted optical microscope. the protocol for spri image collection and analysis is described in the methods section.

in this study, we employed the use of both  <dig> and  <dig> nm incident light. according to theory, adjusting the wavelength of the incident light affects spatial resolution, refractive index sensitivity, and evanescent wave penetration depth  <cit> . however, in practice, we could detect little difference in spatial resolution at the two wavelengths. the main difference was that  <dig> nm spr images had a larger depth of field and therefore a larger portion of the image was in focus at the maximal spatial resolution. also, even though figure  <dig> indicates that  <dig> nm light provided greater sensitivity, the sensitivity at  <dig> nm was maximized by using a gold thickness  more optimal for  <dig> nm signal response and image analysis was used to average many pixel values into one measurement. this enabled both wavelengths to be sufficiently sensitive and provide comparable results for protein mass/area. for the data shown here, we used  <dig> nm incident light for monitoring time-dependent deposition of protein coupled with difference imaging to obtain a signal-to-noise of ~ <dig> ng/cm <dig>  for cell measurements we used  <dig> nm incident light with a signal-to-noise of ~ <dig> ng/cm <dig>  because the cell mass provides a very large spr signal, the smaller response of  <dig> nm light helped insure linearity of spr signal to mass. the spr evanescent wave penetration depth  for  <dig> nm light is calculated to be ~ <dig> nm compared to ~ <dig> nm for  <dig> nm light. thus, about 63% of the intensity of the field for the  <dig> nm light is penetrating to a depth of  <dig> nm above the gold surface. the lower penetration of  <dig> nm light allowed us to image cell-matrix interactions while minimizing contributions to the spr signal from the cell interior.

substrate patterning and fibronectin deposition
spri allows monitoring of the deposition of the extracellular matrix protein, fibronectin, which serves as the ecm for subsequent cell measurements. microcontact printing  <cit>  was used to prepare  <dig> μm by  <dig> μm square patterns of a methyl terminated alkanethiol monolayer on gold. the intervening areas were backfilled with a protein resistant polyethylene glycol -terminated alkanethiol, followed by adsorption of fibronectin to the methyl terminated region. figure 3a shows the resulting spr image of the pattern of fibronectin areas , each surrounded by darker  areas of peg-alkanethiol. figure 3b shows the kinetics of fibronectin adsorption to the hexadecanethiol coated surface followed by spri using  <dig> nm incident light and difference imaging  <cit>  as described in the methods. figure 3b shows that there is little adsorption to the peg-thiol coated areas. fibronectin appears to saturate the surface after exposure of about an hour. because the refractive index changes are directly proportional to mass of protein adsorbed, the rate of protein adsorption and the total protein coverage can be determined . fitting the data to a homogeneous langmuir model yielded a rate constant for adsorption of  <dig>  ×  <dig> l mol- <dig> s- <dig>  and a mass/area of approximately  <dig> ng/cm <dig> of fibronectin. this value is in good agreement with radiolabeled fibronectin adsorption onto a 1-dodecanethiol coated surface  <cit> . at saturation, the standard deviation for protein bound was approximately  <dig> ng/cm <dig> of protein, providing an estimate of signal-to-noise ratio of greater than  <dig> 

following fibronectin adsorption, the patterned sample was exposed to serum-containing cell culture medium and measured by spri at  <dig> nm for over  <dig> minutes at 37°c. the kinetics of adsorption of serum components to the fibronectin coated surface is displayed in figure 3c and shows approximately  <dig> ng/cm <dig> of serum proteins added to the surface at saturation; this result is consistent with a previous report that observed serum albumin adsorption onto fibronectin coated substrates  <cit> . negligible adsorption of protein to the peg-thiol coated areas was observed. the spri reflectivity signals were converted to mass/area of serum proteins bound based on the partial specific volume for globular proteins  <cit> . although spri cannot independently identify the specific proteins absorbed, the partial specific volume for globular proteins is highly conserved  <cit> , and therefore the amount of protein adsorbed can be estimated with good accuracy, without requiring specific knowledge of the composition.

fibronectin and serum proteins appear to adsorb homogeneously onto the hexadecanethiol patterns as shown in line scans of spr intensity across these areas . this observation is shown here to provide contrast to the non-uniform distribution of deposited protein following the addition of cells to the matrix as shown in following sections.

spr imaging of cells and patterned fibronectin
the pseudocolor scale in figure  <dig> indicates the reflectivity values associated with areas of different mass. it can be seen that the peg areas have the lowest mass, with a reflectivity on the order of  <dig> . the adsorption of protein to the hexadecanethiol areas results in a higher reflectivity ranging between  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the greatest mass and highest reflectivity values are associated with regions of cell-substrate interactions. figure  <dig> shows that a number of cells appear to span the peg-thiol regions. since the cell thickness is much larger than the depth of penetration of the plasmon evanescent wave, spri contrast is putatively generated by the distance that the cell membrane is from the surface. thus, for cells that span peg locations  the region of the cell above the peg often has less intensity, suggesting that the part of the cell that spans the peg-thiol is further from the substrate than the rest of the cell.

the optical contrast provided by spri allows label-free segmentation of cell areas. segmentation of cells  based on the spr signal  compared to segmentation based on staining with texas red maleimide  shows that both spr and fluorescence images provide similar outlines for cell area. subtle differences are observed, however, in specific areas that provide a strong fluorescence intensity, but little spr signal . these observations suggest that portions of cells reside farther away from the interface than is detectable by the spr evanescent wave.

spri of cellular deposited material
it is known that cells modify their extracellular environment and can deposit, attach, secrete, and replace material on the substrate to which they adhere  <cit> . fluorescence detection can be used to chemically identify individual components in each of these processes. spri, in contrast, does not chemically identify specific proteins at an interface, but as we will demonstrate, can be used to generate an overall mass/area measurement of cell-deposited material. the amount of putative cell deposited material attached to the fibronectin patterned surfaces during  <dig> h of cell culture was quantified by spri using  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm light. representative contrast-adjusted images  show that protein deposition is greater in fibronectin areas that are more heavily populated by cells  than in squares in which there are few cells . the spr signal in  <dig> regions of high and low cell density were averaged and compared. using a partial specific volume between that for globular and fibrillar proteins, we determined that, on average, an additional  <dig> ng/cm <dig> of protein was associated with regions of high cell occupancy versus low cell occupancy. the peg-thiol areas remained essentially unchanged during this time. a schematic of the layers of protein deposition detected by spri is shown in figure 5b. approximately  <dig> ng/cm <dig> of fibronectin adsorbed onto hexadecanethiol,  <dig> ng/cm <dig> serum proteins adsorbed onto fibronectin, and an additional  <dig> ng/cm <dig> protein was deposited onto the fibronectin patterns at regions of high cell density. the layer schematic does not account for possible displacement of fibronectin by serum proteins, which has been observed to be minimal on hydrophobic substrates  <cit> .

unlike the adsorption of fibronectin and serum proteins from solution, which was largely spatially homogeneous as shown in figure 3d, the deposition of additional protein after cell seeding was not uniform. spatial analysis of cell-derived protein was performed by determining the amount of protein deposited as a function of spatial proximity to cell edges. spr images of fibronectin-coated areas occupied with varying densities of cells are shown in figure 5c. cell edges were defined with a single threshold value, and used to create a contour outline of each cell, which was then sequentially dilated in 1-pixel steps  out to  <dig> μm from the cell edge . the image processing used to generate these images is described in methods. in figure 5c, the contour line is shown at  <dig> μm from the cell edge, and is colored magenta when it overlays a fibronectin area and green when it overlays a peg-thiol region. the spr intensity values under the magenta or green lines were averaged for each contour trace around the cell periphery. figure 5d shows the plot of deposited protein coverage versus distance from the cell edge for fibronectin coated areas. the amount of material on these regions decreases with distance away from a cell. this observation is consistent with the idea that more cell-derived protein would be deposited closer to cells than further away. the high surface coverage of fibronectin used in this study  was chosen to minimize cell migration  <cit> . hence, we surmise that most of the material detected is likely cell-secreted and/or cell-assembled. notably, no measurable protein deposition onto the peg-thiol areas was detected . these data demonstrate that the difference in reflectivity with distance-from-cell edge is due to material that deposits onto fibronectin but not onto peg.

while the flat response of the peg distance-to-cell-edge coverage plot in figure 5e shows that no measurable cell derived material is being deposited onto the peg regions, it also serves as an image analysis control to insure influence from edge effects is minimized. this also shows that other effects such as lateral decay of spr signal are not observed to bleed into low signal regions.

we also observed that in areas of low cell density  and high cell density  that there was deposition of protein that was dependent on distance from cell edges . this distance dependence was observed to be more pronounced when applied to regions of lower cell density. the sometimes more subtle distance dependence at high cell density is perhaps due to the influence of material secreted by neighboring cells.

to assess the time-dependent deposition of cellular protein, figure  <dig> shows analysis of the addition of protein to the substrate by live cells at different time points , these data were generated using the approach applied to the data in figure  <dig>  cells were identified by simple thresholding as described earlier, and this threshold provided indication of the cell edges. in this experiment, cells were seeded onto  <dig> μm ×  <dig> μm fibronectin patterns that had been pre-incubated with serum-containing media overnight to allow serum proteins to adsorb to the fibronectin areas. immediately after addition of cells, no additional material is observed to adsorb onto the fibronectin substrate and the surface coverage is observed to be evenly distributed spatially . at  <dig> min after addition of cells, increased spr signals, indicating the presence of newly adsorbed protein, appear in areas close to the cell edges. at  <dig> h after seeding, additional protein mass is detected and is distributed spatially as a function of proximity to the cell edge. similar to the analysis on fixed cells, most of the cell-derived additions to the substrate appear within  <dig> μm of the cell edges. this suggests that this additional material is derived from cells, and could be contributed to by cell secretions, cell material left behind following lamelopodia retraction, and/or cell assembly of ecm proteins from the serum.

as verification that the additional additive material is completely cell derived, vsmc were plated in growth medium containing  <dig> μg/ml cycloheximide , a protein synthesis inhibitor  <cit> . the approach allows us to observe the interaction of the cells with the fibronectin patterned surface in the absence of new protein synthesis. figure 7a shows a representative image of chx treated cells that are fixed  <dig> h after plating and figure 7b shows an image of untreated cells. the data were generated using the approach applied to the data in figure  <dig>  at  <dig> h after plating, additional mass is detected proximal to the cell edge for the untreated cells but no additional material is observed to adsorb onto the fibronectin surface for the chx treated cells . from this, we conclude that the additional material is derived from cells.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that spr images, obtained without the addition of fluorescent or other labels, can provide information on cell-substrate contacts, ecm deposition and substrate protein patterns. cells can be observed over long periods of time because cellular damage is minimized at the low light levels that are sufficient for spri. a previous report demonstrated the first example of spr imaging of cells  <cit> , but the present study describes how the use of appropriate optical architecture, light sources, and image analysis permit a successful application of spri. this study demonstrates the use of spri to perform cell object segmentation, protein pattern identification, and quantitation of protein deposition by cells. live-cell measurements by spri demonstrate the time-dependent deposition of cellular protein. the data indicate that spri can detect deposited protein with a sensitivity of ~ <dig> ng/cm <dig>  and can achieve a lateral resolution of at least  <dig> μm. while the current study does not attempt to identify the proteins that cells contribute to the matrix, future integration of spri with fluorescence based microscopy methods will combine the unique label-free information from spri of live cells with complementary biochemical information for a more complete understanding of cell interactions with their extracellular environment.
