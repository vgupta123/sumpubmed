BACKGROUND
exposure to allergen is one of the important factors to induce and enhance asthma pathogenesis, which is characterized by reversible bronchoconstriction, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation. allergen inhalation challenge is a useful model to investigate the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases  <cit> . the asthmatic response can be evaluated by airflow limitation which can be measured as forced expiratory volume in  <dig> second  drop using a spirometer. recently, we have reported differential changes in the gene expression of peripheral blood leukocytes in atopic asthmatic individuals  <dig> hours following allergen inhalation challenge  <cit> , indicating the application of gene expression in blood for assessing the asthmatic response. as blood is the pipeline of the immune system, assessing changes in expression profiles gives a comprehensive view of the status of the immune system in health and disease  <cit> . since allergen exposure triggers immune responses, including the production of various mediators, inflammatory cell proliferation and infiltration in the human body, the immune cells and their gene expression can be good exploratory targets to understand the mechanisms of the asthmatic response to allergen inhalation challenge.

micrornas  are a class of small noncoding rnas with a regulatory function on gene expression to control various biological processes such as cellular proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of malignancy, cardiovascular and other diseases  <cit> . several studies have previously reported the role of mirnas in asthma using the allergen inhalation challenge model. in the lung, mirna profiles were significantly changed in the experimental mouse model mimicking acute and chronic human asthma  <cit> . in humans, while a study comparing the mirna profile of airway biopsies revealed no significant difference in the expression of  <dig> mirnas between mild asthmatics compared to healthy volunteers  <cit> , a more recent study on cultured human bronchial epithelial cells revealed inherent differences in the expression of mirnas isolated from healthy and asthmatic subjects  <cit> . changes in mirna profiles have not been clarified in the human asthmatic response during the allergen inhalation challenge. in this study, we focused on the mirna profiles in human peripheral blood and hypothesized that mirna profiles altered by allergen inhalation challenge can be detected in peripheral blood.

RESULTS
subjects characteristics
seven subjects with stable, mild atopic asthma participated in the allergen inhalation challenge. four healthy control subjects  were recruited to serve as controls. the demographics of seven subjects with mild atopic asthma and four hcs are presented in table  <dig>  all asthmatic subjects developed an immediate drop in fev <dig> of greater than 20% .

processing of peripheral blood for mirna panel codeset
peripheral blood was drawn immediately before  and after allergen inhalation  from asthmatics. peripheral blood from hcs was collected as controls. extracted rna was analysed using nanostring ncounter assay. one hundred and sixty-three of the  <dig> mirnas profiled using the nanostring ncounter assay were above background across all samples. the data set was normalized to the sum of the  <dig> mirnas, such that each sample had the same total mirna code count. mirnas above at least  <dig> code counts were retained for downstream analysis. the dataset  underwent log <dig> transformation prior to statistical analysis.

differentially expressed mirna in nanostring ncounter assay
two independent linear models were used to determine significant mirnas for the two comparisons; hcs versus pre-challenge, and pre versus post-challenge. mir- <dig> was significant in both comparisons at a false discovery rate  of 1% . mir- <dig> was down-regulated in both comparisons , that is, mir- <dig> was significantly under-expressed in asthmatics  compared to hcs and decreased following allergen inhalation challenge.

mir- <dig> expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
given the heterogeneous nature of whole blood, changes in mirna expression may not be due to changes in mirna expression in specific cells but due to changes in the relative cell-type frequencies. leukocyte differentials were significantly different among the three groups, while complete blood counts such as erythrocytes, total leukocytes and platelets were not significantly different among groups . in order to determine whether mir- <dig> expression was associated with certain cell-type frequencies, a multiple regression of mir- <dig> expression onto the cell-type frequencies was performed for each group  independently. given the small sample size of hcs , the neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils were combined  to form a granulocyte group whereas the lymphocytes and monocytes were combined into a peripheral blood mononuclear cells  group. the regression coefficients representing the mean mir- <dig> expression for granulocytes and pbmcs were extracted for each group . in order to determine whether the partials for granulocytes and pbmcs were significantly different between groups, a test-statistic for each cell-type between two independent groups was calculated . this statistic compares whether the slopes for two independent groups are different for the same cell-type: that is, for the same increase in a particular cell frequency, is the increase in the mean mirna expression greater in one group that the other. this increase is independent of changes in other cellular frequencies. mir- <dig> expression at the same frequency of granulocytes is similar between hcs and asthmatics , however, the mean mir- <dig> expression was significantly  higher in hcs than in asthmatics  for the same frequency of pbmcs independent of the frequency of granulocytes . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the empirical distributions for these comparisons for  <dig> permutations. this may suggest that the decrease in mir- <dig> seen in whole blood  may be due to a decrease in mir- <dig> expression in pbmcs independent of changes in the frequency of granulocytes. although figure 2b shows that mir- <dig> expression in pbmcs decreases post-challenge which is also seen in whole blood , this change was not significant.

technical validation using real-time reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
mir- <dig> was technically validated  using rt-qpcr showing that the level in asthmatics  was significantly  lower than hcs and that post-challenge was significantly lower than pre-challenge.

the normalized relative mir- <dig> expression quantified using rt-qpcr was also regressed onto the relative cell-type frequencies of granulocytes and pbmcs for hc and pre-challenge in separate linear models. the regression coefficient for pbmcs in healthy individuals  was significantly  higher than the regression coefficient for pbmcs in asthmatics at pre-challenge  .

genes up-regulated in allergen inhalation challenge and targeted by mir-192
to clarify the suggestive mechanisms of mir- <dig> in allergen inhalation challenge, genes targeted by mir- <dig> were retrieved from the list of differentially expressed genes between pre- and  <dig> hour post-allergen challenge, which kam et al. reported in their manuscript  <cit> . among  <dig> genes which were significantly altered and predicted as target genes for mir- <dig> by databases miranda and targetscan,  <dig> genes were up-regulated while  <dig> genes were down-regulated post-challenge. to clarify the biological mechanisms, we performed network modeling using metacore from genego , allowing us to build a candidate network indicating possible interactions between genes. the functional ontology enrichment tool, which was used for analysing  <dig> up-regulated genes by considering their mappings onto terms of a given metacore ontology, showed a number of significant  inflammatory pathways such as chrebp regulation pathway and ifnα/β signalling pathway . similarly, the list of up-regulated target genes was used to generate biological networks using the canonical pathway modeling algorithm. additional file 1: table s <dig> shows the list of networks that are highly enriched with canonical pathways. the results comprise network objects corresponding to genes and other interacting objects in canonical pathways found in databases. for the top two highly enriched pathways, one pathway was related to dna damage and cell cycle regulation  and the other pathway was related to immunological response and stress response .

discussion
we analysed for the first time the change in mirna profiles of human asthmatics undergoing allergen inhalation challenge as well as the difference in mirna profiles between pre-level in asthmatics and healthy control subjects without asthma history. mir- <dig> was significantly lower in post-allergen inhalation challenge compared to pre-challenge, as well as lower in asthmatics compared to healthy control subjects, suggesting that the change in mir- <dig> level may be involved in the atopic asthma and asthmatic reaction after allergen inhalation challenge. cell specific expression of mir- <dig> was associated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells . among the genes we have previously reported to be altered following allergen inhalation challenge  <cit> , predicted target genes of mir- <dig> were largely up-regulated suggesting the inhibitory role of mir- <dig> on their expression. the result showing that these target genes were enriched for the functions on cell cycle and immune response supports the notion that mirna can regulate such biological functions in the asthmatic response.

mir- <dig> has been studied in various conditions including cancer and autoimmune diseases. several reports showed that mir- <dig> affects cellular proliferation through the p <dig> pathway, which regulates cell cycle. the cell cycle checkpoint control genes, p <dig> and p <dig> were overexpressed in cells with overexpressed mir- <dig> in vitro using human cell lines  <cit> . in the canonical pathway modeling in our results for the up-regulated target genes for mir- <dig>  cell cycle regulation and response to dna damage was one of the top-listed pathways, suggesting that mir- <dig> mediates cell cycle regulation of blood cells in response to allergen challenge. in the other study investigating the response of mirna to environment, exposure to cigarette smoke decreased mir- <dig> expression in the lung in animal experimental model  <cit> . given that the cigarette smoke exposure induces airway inflammation and cellular stress such as oxidative stress, this report supports our findings that mir- <dig> is regulating the response to mirnas to environmental exposure inducing airway inflammation. as shown in the other top-listed pathway in the canonical pathway modeling in our data, mir- <dig> was suggested to mediate the immune response following allergen inhalation. in addition, as a biomarker in peripheral blood, mir- <dig> has been reported to decrease in systemic lupus erythematosus, a systemic autoimmune disease inducing inflammatory responses  <cit> . perturbation of mirna profiles in response to inflammatory stimuli can occur in peripheral blood and the changes can be detected. interestingly, mir- <dig> expression is also reportedly decreased in response to tgf-β and loss of mir- <dig> correlates with tubulointerstitial fibrosis and reduction in renal function in renal biopsies from patients with established diabetic nephropathy  <cit> . allergen inhalation challenge induces up-regulation of tgf-β in the airway epithelium  <cit> . tgf-β has been implicated in airway remodeling and inflammation, which are features of chronic asthma. although the origin of the mirna needs to be clarified, our data showing down-regulated mir- <dig> in the blood after allergen inhalation challenge may indicate similar tgf-β derived mechanisms. since the mechanism of mir- <dig> has not been elucidated in allergic airway diseases, further studies are needed to clarify these mechanisms.

peripheral blood consists of various types of cells such that the expression of a given mirna is the net expression from all the various cell-types. in this report, statistical methods for deconvolving cell-specific mirna levels from whole blood experiments were used. this approach called cell-specific significance analysis of microarrays   <cit>  can combine information from complete blood cell count, including leukocyte differentials, and whole blood gene expression data to deconvolve cell specific expression measurements that can then be compared across groups. we have previously shown that cssam can uncover cell-specific gene expression signatures in whole blood in two independent studies  <cit> . we utilized this approach to analyse cell-specific analysis for mir- <dig> expression in granulocytes and pbmcs. the difference of mir- <dig> levels is suggested to be derived from pbmcs in our data, suggesting that further studies on the subtype of lymphocytes and monocytes will help reveal the mechanisms of mirna in asthma and asthmatic responses as well. mir- <dig> levels are reportedly different among subsets of lymphocytes  <cit> . a study comparing mirna expression in a wide range of haematological cell lines showed that mir- <dig> was up-regulated in activated b cells  <cit> . allergen challenge induces a dynamic shift of lymphocyte populations in blood.  <dig> hours after challenge there was a reduction of peripheral blood cd4+ t lymphocytes from a baseline whereas cd4+ t lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar fluid increased, suggesting lymphocyte recruitment into the respiratory system after allergen challenge  <cit> . in a baseline comparison between asthmatics and healthy controls, while there was no significant difference in number of t cells or b cells in peripheral blood  <cit> , their subpopulations and activation state have been reported to be different. several studies investigating peripheral blood cells in mild asthma also showed the increase in the number of activated population such as cd23-bearing b cells and cd25-bearing t cells in mild atopic asthmatics as well as low number of gamma delta t cells in the peripheral blood of asthmatics  <cit> . given that cell populations and subpopulations can affect the mirna levels, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between such cellular populations and differential mirna profiles, for example through the use of statistical deconvolution methods such as cssam.

the cssam test statistic which compares the mean mirna expression for each cell type between two independent groups does not take into account the paired structure of our longitudinal study design. since it is possible to achieve statistical significance with smaller treatment effects in a paired study design, using an unpaired test statistic may explain why the reduction of mir- <dig> expression in pbmcs post-challenge compared to pre-challenge was not statistically significant . accounting for the within individual variation through the use of a mixed-effects model or multilevel data analysis with a modification to the cssam test statistic may help improve the statistical significance of the cssam test statistic in longitudinal studies. the small number of subjects limited the number of cell-types for cell-specific analyses in this study. future studies with larger sample size will enable us to further study the role of additional cell types. in addition we have not compared the phenotypes induced by allergen inhalation challenge such as early responders and dual responders. the current analyses comparing pre and post combined these phenotypes, which may serve as confounding factors. given the sample size a technical validation with rt-qpcr was deemed appropriate. given the course of allergen inhalation challenge, a longer time course study of mirna levels in blood in both asthmatics and healthy subjects also needs to be explored. collectively, a further study using a different cohort consisting of a large sample size is needed to validate the decrease in mir- <dig> levels in asthmatics after allergen inhalation challenge. thereafter, cell-specific approaches for differential mirnas will also validate our results as well as shed light on further mechanisms of mirnas in certain cell types in peripheral blood cells.

CONCLUSIONS
mirna profile changes can be detected in peripheral blood of asthmatic subjects undergoing allergen inhalation challenge and between healthy control and asthmatics. among them, changes in mir- <dig> level may be involved in asthma mechanisms. these results indicate that allergen inhalation challenge can be a suitable model to explore mirna profiles and help elucidate the mechanisms of allergic asthma in humans.
