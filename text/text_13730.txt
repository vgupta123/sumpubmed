BACKGROUND
sphingosine-1-phosphate  and lysophosphatidic acid  are phospholipid growth factors which are present in normal serum and plasma. these lipids elicit diverse responses from a wide range of cell types, including enhanced cell survival, cell proliferation, induction of cytoskeletal changes and chemotaxis  family. the edg receptor family is classified into two clusters based on ligand selectivity: s1p1/2/3/4/ <dig>  specifically respond to s1p whilst lpa1/2/ <dig>  respond to lpa  <cit> . members of the s1p receptor family display higher sequence similarity to each other  than to members of the lpa receptor family . these homologies, coupled with observed differences in the structure of s1p and lpa receptor genes, suggest that these receptor families evolved from distinct ancestral genes. the s1p receptors contain a conserved glutamic acid residue present within the third tm that corresponds to glutamine in the lpa receptors. interaction between distinct functional groups present on s1p and lpa with this residue was shown for the s1p <dig> and lpa <dig> receptors using computational modelling techniques  <cit>  and was demonstrated as the basis for the ligand preference displayed by the receptors. experimental characterisation confirmed that replacement of glutamic acid with glutamine in s1p <dig> changed ligand specificity from s1p to lpa, and the reciprocal mutation in lpa <dig> resulted in recognition of both lpa and s1p  <cit> .

in the present study, the role of this residue in determining ligand selectivity for the s1p <dig> receptor was examined. phylogenetic analysis of the edg family of receptors indicates that s1p <dig> is more closely related to other s1p receptors than receptors which respond to lpa. however, s1p <dig> lies on the edge of the s1p family cluster and has been shown to bind s1p with lower affinity than other s1p receptors and hence it has been suggested that s1p is not the true endogenous agonist of this receptor  <cit> . we therefore decided to investigate whether replacement of this residue ) with glutamine conferred lpa-responsiveness to the s1p <dig> receptor and hence determine the role of this residue in this lower-affinity s1p receptor. to achieve this, we expressed wild type and e <dig> q mutant s1p <dig> receptors in cho-k <dig> cells and studied responses to lysophospholipids using a gtpγs binding assay. since cho-k <dig> cells respond to lpa, we utilised fusion proteins constructed between the s1p <dig> receptor and a pertussis toxin-insensitive gαi <dig> g protein. expression of these proteins in cho-k <dig> cells followed by treatment with pertussis toxin prior to harvest allowed elimination of any signal due to stimulation of endogenous lpa receptors. within this study, we also examined how the length of the lpa acyl chain affected potency at the mutant s1p <dig> receptor, using a panel of naturally occurring lpa analogues. computational models of complexes between the wild type or mutant s1p <dig> receptor and s1p and lpa species were used to provide a molecular interpretation of the experimental findings.

RESULTS
human ha-s1p <dig> was mutated at position  <dig> to replace the naturally occurring glutamic acid with glutamine. the mutant and wild type receptors were stably expressed in cho-k <dig> cells as in-frame gpcr-g protein fusions with pertussis toxin-insensitive gαi <dig>  western blotting was used to detect expression of these fusion proteins. membranes from ha-s1p4-gαi1- or ha-s1p4q)-gαi1-transfected cells contained a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda, which reacted with anti-ha and anti-sg <dig> antibodies  and was consistent with expression of the gpcr-g protein fusion. confirmation of comparable cell-surface expression of these proteins was obtained via facs analysis using an anti-ha antibody directly conjugated with fluorescein .

the response of ha-s1p4-gαi <dig> and ha-s1p4q)-gαi <dig> to s1p was assessed using membranes from cells transfected to express these proteins and treated with pertussis toxin prior to harvest. s1p promoted dose-dependent increase in gtpγs binding to membranes containing ha-s1p4-gαi <dig> with an ec <dig> of  <dig> nm ±  <dig> nm ; in contrast, membranes from ha-s1p4q)-gαi1-expressing cells demonstrated severely impaired response to s1p . the ec <dig> for s1p stimulation of the ha-s1p4-gαi <dig> fusion protein  was not statistically significantly different from that obtained using the unfused ha-s1p <dig> receptor  and compared favourably with published values for this receptor in hek293t cells from two different research groups of  <dig> nm  <cit>  and  <dig> nm  <cit> .

structure activity relationships were determined by the gtpγs assay for s1p <dig> or its e <dig> q mutant using s1p and lpa species with 14: <dig>  16: <dig> and 18: <dig> acyl chains at a single  concentration. of the lysophospholipids tested, only s1p induced a strong response over basal levels  in membranes containing ha-s1p4-gαi <dig> , whilst 18: <dig> lpa did not stimulate a statistically significant response; weak stimulation of gtpγs binding was observed with 14: <dig> and 16: <dig> lpa . in contrast, membranes containing ha-s1p4q)-gαi <dig> showed at least weak response to each ligand . the weakest agonist at the e <dig> q mutant s1p <dig> receptor was 18: <dig> lpa, which produced only 14% ± 2% stimulation over basal. s1p and 16: <dig> lpa gave approximately 21% ± 4% and 19% ± 4% stimulation over basal response, respectively. the best agonist for the e <dig> q mutant was 14: <dig> lpa, which gave a 40% ± 2% enhancement over basal levels. the stimulation promoted by 14: <dig> lpa was statistically different from that produced by 18: <dig> lpa . sensitivity of the receptor to stimulation by each form of lpa, and particularly 14: <dig> lpa, was markedly increased after introduction of the e <dig> q mutation and indicated that this position was important in influencing ha-s1p <dig> ligand preference.

these results indicate that introduction of the e <dig> q mutation in the s1p <dig> receptor confers lpa-responsiveness, and that a short form of lpa was a more effective agonist than the intermediate and longer forms, when tested at this single concentration. dose response curves were constructed for ligand-induced activation of the e <dig> q s1p <dig> mutant by the 14: <dig> and 18: <dig> forms of lpa as well as s1p . an ec <dig> could only be determined for the 14: <dig> form of lpa as s1p and 18: <dig> lpa caused minimal stimulation at only the highest concentration tested. the ec <dig> value for activation of ha-s1p4q)-gαi <dig> was calculated to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm. however, since a plateau of maximal stimulation was not achieved, interpretation of this ec <dig> value needs caution. this result clearly showed that 14: <dig> lpa was a weak agonist of ha-s1p4q)-gαi <dig> and hence confirmed the involvement of residue  <dig> in s1p <dig> ligand preference. similar results were obtained using a second cho-k <dig> clone expressing this fusion protein .

computational modelling of the s1p complex with the wild type s1p <dig> receptor identifies the best s1p binding site within the tm with the phosphate group at the extracellular end . ion pairs appear between the phosphate group of s1p and two cationic amino acids, r <dig>  and k <dig> . an additional ion pair occurs between the cationic ammonium of s1p and e <dig> . hydrophobic residues from tm <dig>  tm <dig>  tm <dig> and tm <dig> line the binding pocket and surround the alkyl chain of s1p.

the best complex of 14: <dig> lpa in the e <dig> q s1p <dig> mutant receptor model has striking similarity to the best complex of s1p in the wild type s1p <dig> receptor model . both models demonstrate ion pairing between the phosphate group and two cationic amino acids, r <dig>  and k <dig> . each ligand interacts with the amino acid at position  <dig> , s1p by an ion pair with the carboxylate of the wild type glutamate and 14: <dig> lpa by a hydrogen bond with the mutated glutamine. multiple hydrophobic residues surround the nonpolar tails of the lipid ligands. the superimposition of the two complexes  also demonstrates that the ligands occupy almost identical volumes. common interactions and overlap volumes are qualitatively consistent with the experimental findings that these ligands give similar 48% and 40% maximal stimulation over basal for s1p at the wild type and 14: <dig> lpa at the mutant receptor, respectively.

in contrast to the complexes of 14: <dig> lpa with e <dig> q s1p <dig> and s1p with wild type s1p <dig>  the remaining complexes show much less common volume . most complexes exhibit the phosphate interactions described for 14: <dig> lpa with e <dig> q s1p <dig> and s1p with wild type s1p <dig>  of particular interest is the observation that the best complexes generated by autodock for the 18: <dig> lpa species with wild type s1p <dig> has a very high positive van der waals interaction energy, >  <dig> kcal/mol, compared to values well under  <dig> kcal/mol for every other complex studied. in the best complexes found for 16: <dig> lpa and 18: <dig> lpa in both constructs, the terminal six to eight carbons of the hydrophobic tails fold into l-shaped conformations quite different from the extended conformations observed in the s1p complex with wild type s1p <dig> or the 14: <dig> lpa complex with the e <dig> q s1p <dig> mutant. the terminal carbons in several complexes curl out of the receptor between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  due to the restricted length of the binding pocket. these results suggest that the complete lack of s1p <dig> activation in response to 18: <dig> lpa is likely due to failure to form a complex. the strongest complexes formed, s1p with wild type s1p <dig> and 14: <dig> lpa with the e <dig> q s1p <dig> mutant, have complementary interactions with the residue at position  <dig> . these strong complexes give the most robust activation. weak complexes are formed for other combinations due to mismatched interactions with position  <dig>  or excessive length of the hydrophobic tail. the presence of hydrophobic tails of 16: <dig> or 18: <dig> lpa between transmembrane domains may additionally impair the conformational change necessary for full agonist responses.

discussion
parental cho-k <dig> cells respond to lpa in functional assays, reflecting expression of endogenous lpa <dig> . for this reason, fusion proteins between wild type or mutant ha-s1p <dig> and the pertussis toxin-insensitive gαi <dig> g protein were used in these studies. expression of these proteins in cho-k <dig> cells followed by treatment with pertussis toxin prior to harvest allowed elimination of any signal due to stimulation of endogenous lpa receptors. mcallister et al.  <cit>   in controlling s1p <dig> ligand selectivity using functional and computational methods. this residue, which is conserved throughout the s1p receptors, has been shown to control ligand specificity for the related s1p <dig> receptor  <cit> . introduction of the e <dig> q mutation severely affected the response of s1p <dig> to s1p: in dose-response experiments s1p caused minimal stimulation at only the highest concentration of ligand used. this is in agreement with published observations for activation of the equivalent s1p <dig> mutant  <cit> . 14: <dig> lpa was able to induce dose-dependent stimulation of s1p4q) with an ec <dig> of approximately  <dig>  μm but only promoted minimal stimulation of the wild type s1p <dig> receptor. the modelled complexes of 14: <dig> lpa with e <dig> q s1p <dig> and s1p with wild type s1p <dig> demonstrate nearly identical volumes occupied by the two ligands and very similar interactions between these ligands and their respective receptors. of particular importance are amino acid residues at positions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , which either ion pair with the phosphate or interact with the 2-amino or 2-hydroxyl group in s1p and 14: <dig> lpa, respectively. the importance of interactions with amino acids at positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  has been previously noted for the s1p <dig>  <cit>  and lpa <dig> , <dig>  <cit>  receptors.

the s1p <dig> receptor exhibits marked constitutive  activity  which was unaffected by the introduction of the e <dig> q mutation . this indicates that the mutation perturbs s1p recognition without affecting the ability of the receptor to spontaneously adopt an active conformation. similar observations have been reported for the β2ar, where a mutation in the sixth transmembrane domain abolished agonist activation but not constitutive activity  <cit> .

unlike s1p, which exists as a single species in vivo, the term lpa actually refers to a family of molecules that take the general form 1-o-acyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphate. naturally occurring forms of lpa contain acyl chains of differing lengths, with differing degrees of saturation. investigations into the effect of the length and degree of saturation of the acyl chain of lpa have been undertaken for the lpa receptors  <cit> , but limited sar information is available for s1p receptors . the lpa-responsive e <dig> q s1p <dig> mutant facilitates structure activity relationship  studies due to the greater availability of lpa analogs relative to s1p analogs. comparison of space-filling models of the structures of s1p and three analogues of lpa  revealed that 14: <dig> lpa most closely resembled s1p in terms of apparent length. gtpγs binding assays demonstrated greater agonist activity of 14: <dig> lpa at the mutant receptor relative to 18: <dig> or 16: <dig> lpa. this sar indicates a length restriction for the s1p <dig> agonist binding site. model complexes of 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> lpa contained alkyl chains that fold at the bottom of the binding pocket, defined by a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids. three of these differ either in position of sidechain branching or size relative to lpa receptors and the other s1p receptors. position  <dig> , i <dig> in s1p <dig>  is leucine in lpa1– <dig> and other s1p receptors. residue i <dig>  is larger than the valine found in the other four s1p receptors, lpa <dig> and lpa <dig>  finally, i <dig>  corresponds to the smaller valine in s1p <dig> and s1p <dig> and the much smaller alanine in lpa <dig>  these findings provide a molecular explanation for a similar sar observed using para-alkyl amide analogs of s1p  <cit> . sar obtained with the s1p <dig> mutant are in contrast to that shown by lpa receptors, which exhibit the general trend of 18: <dig> ≥ 16: <dig> > 14: <dig> for potency and maximal stimulation  <cit> .

since mutation of residue  <dig> in the s1p <dig> receptor from the naturally occurring glutamic acid to glutamine conferred responsiveness to 14: <dig> lpa and severely affected responses to s1p, our observations support the hypothesis that this conserved residue in the third transmembrane domain of the s1p receptors is involved in ligand recognition. this is in contrast to a recent paper describing models of several gpcrs, including s1p <dig>  which had been generated using novel first principle methods  <cit> . in this model of s1p <dig>  interactions between s1p and residues t <dig>  and w <dig>  and e <dig>  were observed. interaction of e <dig>  with the ammonium group of s1p appeared to control ligand selectivity since the other residues appeared to interact with the phosphate group, which is present on both lpa and s1p. it is therefore surprising that none of these residues are conserved throughout the s1p or lpa receptor families. the data presented here support the assertion that glutamic acid residue  <dig>  present in the third transmembrane domain of the s1p receptors controls ligand selectivity and suggest that the s1p <dig> model described by vaidehi et al.  <cit>  is inaccurate.

the current study provides new information for the development of more selective s1p receptor agonists. in particular, an s1p analog with its hydrophobic chain extended by either  <dig> or  <dig> carbons would be a very poor agonist of the s1p <dig> receptor. on the other hand, the activation of the s1p1-e <dig> q mutant by 18: <dig> lpa  <cit>  indicates that a chain-extended s1p analog should retain agonist activity at the s1p <dig> receptor. s1p receptor agonists with differing selectivity profiles will be useful tools to more completely map the physiological and pathophysiological roles of these receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies confirm that glutamic acid residue  <dig> , present in the third transmembrane domain of the s1p receptors is important for the selective recognition of s1p, versus the closely related lipid, lpa. mutation of e <dig>  to glutamine diminished response to s1p and allowed structure activity studies using the diverse available lpa species. the mutant s1p <dig> receptor is stimulated most strongly by lpa 14: <dig> and is not activated by the longer lpa 18: <dig>  in contrast with a previous report on the analogous s1p <dig> receptor mutant that responded to lpa 18: <dig>  thus the s1p <dig> receptor ligand binding pocket is shorter in length than the s1p <dig> ligand binding pocket.
