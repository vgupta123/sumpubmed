BACKGROUND
the root lesion nematode pratylenchus neglectus infects a wide range of host plants, including wheat  and crops that are grown in rotation with wheat. as a migratory endoparasite, p. neglectus moves in and out of roots, feeding as it moves through the root cortex. it causes lesions on roots, stunts plant growth and can significantly reduce crop yield. plants that reduce the nematode population in root systems and in the soil are considered to be resistant. resistant crop species and cultivars are valuable in crop rotations because they reduce the threat to subsequent crops.

the australian wheat cultivars excalibur and krichauff have long been known to be at least moderately resistant against p. neglectus <cit> . williams et al.  <cit>  attributed the p. neglectus resistance of these cultivars to a locus  on the long arm of chromosome 7a . they estimated rlnn <dig> to be  <dig>  cm distal to the gene lr <dig>  which confers resistance against leaf rust . lr <dig> has in turn been reported to co-segregate with sr <dig> and pm <dig> <cit> , which confer resistance against stem rust  and powdery mildew , respectively.

evaluation of resistance against p. neglectus can be laborious and costly, requiring replicated inoculated trials involving counting of nematodes  or the extraction of dna from soil and root systems, followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction  to estimate the quantity of p. neglectus dna  <cit> . molecular markers for rlnn <dig> could therefore be very useful selection tools in wheat breeding, allowing phenotyping resources to be allocated only to progeny that had been pre-selected as likely to carry the resistance allele. williams et al.  <cit>  suggested conversion of the restriction fragment length polymorphism  marker cdo <dig> and the amplified fragment length polymorphism  marker agc/cct <dig>  both of which they had reported to be at the same position as lr <dig>  into pcr-based assays for use in marker-assisted selection of rlnn <dig>  to our knowledge, no such assays have been developed. this may have been because the reported distance of  <dig>  cm seemed too large for such markers to be very useful in wheat breeding.

the phytoene synthase locus psy-a <dig> is also in the distal region of 7al  <cit> . at this locus, there are multiple alleles, conferring different levels of yellow pigment in wheat grain and flour  <cit> . krichauff and several other cultivars with moderate resistance against p. neglectus have been reported to carry either the psy-a1s or psy-a1t allele  <cit> , both of which are associated with high levels of yellow pigment in flour. wheat breeders in australia are interested in developing cultivars with both white flour and resistance against p. neglectus, but, to our knowledge, they have not identified any materials with this combination of traits.

in the research reported here, a large mapping population was used to map rlnn <dig> relative to molecular markers and to the genes lr <dig>  sr <dig> and psy-a <dig>  and new markers were developed and validated for use in selection for resistance against p. neglectus.

RESULTS
resistance against leaf rust, stem rust and pratylenchus neglectus
evaluation of disease responses against the p. triticina pathotype 104– <dig> , <dig>  and the p. graminis f. sp. tritici pathotype 98– <dig> ,, <dig>  indicated that excalibur and  <dig> excalibur/kukri doubled haploid  lines carry lr20/sr <dig> resistance, while kukri and  <dig> other excalibur/kukri dh lines are susceptible to both rust pathogens. no lines were observed to be resistant against one pathogen and susceptible to the other, indicating that if lr <dig> and sr <dig> are two genes , they are in complete coupling linkage in the excalibur/kukri population.

the estimated quantity of p. neglectus dna in the roots of inoculated plants, was  <dig>  pg per plant for kukri, but only  <dig>  pg per plant for excalibur. quantitative variation for this measure of nematode resistance was observed within both the rust-resistant and rust-susceptible categories of excalibur/kukri dh lines , with the amount of p. neglectus dna detected being significantly  lower for rust-resistant lines  than for rust-susceptible lines . greater variability was observed for the more susceptible class than for the more resistant class , probably because of inoculation failures  broadening the phenotypic range observed for susceptible lines. failure of inoculation of individual plants  would be much more likely to occur than high multiplication of nematodes on genetically resistant plants.

genetic mapping
analysis of data from the excalibur/kukri mapping population, resulted in a high-quality genetic linkage map of chromosome 7a , with lr20/sr <dig> and psy-a <dig> collocating with each other and with the sequence tagged site  markers schfc <dig> and sts <dig>  the simple sequence repeat  markers gwm <dig> and cfa <dig> and the diversity arrays technology  marker wpt- <dig> at the distal end of 7al. sequencing of the products amplified with psy7a5_f/r primers  <cit>  indicated that excalibur carries the psy-a1t  allele , while amplification with cspsy primers  <cit>  confirmed that kukri carries the psy-a1p  allele.

with qtl analysis using the estimated quantity of p. neglectus dna per plant as the trait value, rlnn <dig> was detected as a highly significant qtl  at the same position as lr <dig>  sr <dig>  psy-a <dig> and the collocating sts, ssr and dart markers. this locus accounted for 60% of the observed phenotypic variation.

development of new markers based on comparative analysis between wheat and rice
since the physical locations of the ssr markers cfa <dig>  and cfa <dig>  had both previously been assigned to the wheat deletion bin 7al16- <dig> - <dig>   <cit> ,  <dig> unique expressed sequence tags  from that deletion bin and  <dig> unique ests from the deletion bin 7al18- <dig> - <dig>  were selected for use in comparative genomic analysis with rice . of these  <dig> ests,  <dig> had blastn e-values less than e- <dig>  consistent with previous evidence of synteny between the distal part of 7al and chromosome  <dig> of rice  <cit> , more than half of these ests were similar to sequences in the terminal region of rice chromosome  <dig> .

similarly, the probe sequences of three rflp markers that had previously been reported to be linked with rlnn <dig>  lr <dig> and/or pm <dig> <cit>  showed high similarity with predicted genes in the terminal region of rice chromosome 6: psr <dig> with loc_os06g <dig> , psr <dig> with loc_os06g <dig> , and cdo <dig> with loc_os06g <dig> . the cdo <dig> sequence also had a significant blastn hit  on rice chromosome  <dig> . for psr <dig>  a probe that had been used to map another rflp near rlnn <dig>  lr <dig> and pm <dig> <cit>  the most significant hit  was on rice chromosome  <dig> .

given the evidence that the terminal region of rice chromosome  <dig> is syntenic with the rlnn <dig> region of wheat chromosome 7a, sequences from the terminal region of rice chromosome  <dig> were used to retrieve orthologous wheat ests and primers were designed to flank predicted introns. analysis of pcr products amplified with primers designed from five wheat ests  detected readily assayable polymorphisms between the parents excalibur and kukri:

 <dig>  be445506: the primer pair be445506_f/r amplified products of approximately 150 bp from both parents and from an artificial heterozygote  . similar amplicons were obtained for all six chinese spring group- <dig> nullisomic-tetrasomic lines , indicating that this primer pair is not genome-specific. with high-resolution melting analysis, a polymorphism between excalibur and kukri was detected, providing a codominant marker assay  .

 <dig>  be445653: the primer pair be445653_f/r  amplified 7a-specific products with differing sizes from excalibur  and kukri . this length polymorphism can be scored visually after electrophoretic separation on agarose gels , providing a codominant marker assay. sequencing of the amplicons revealed that the 74-bp length polymorphism between excalibur and kukri is due to the net effect of a number of insertion/deletion polymorphisms, which range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. sequence polymorphisms between excalibur and kukri were also observed at  <dig> nucleotide sites .

 <dig>  bf484041: the primer pair bf484041_f/r  amplified three distinct products from kukri . in excalibur, only the 7b- and 7d-specific products showed strong amplification . with high-resolution melting analysis, excalibur, kukri and an artificial heterozygote  each had a distinct melting curve, providing a codominant marker assay .

 <dig>  cn010180: the primer pairs cn010180_f1/r and cn010180_f2/r amplified 7a-specific products from excalibur and kukri, respectively. the two clearly visible amplicons were of similar size . with sequential loading of the two pcr products onto gels, the two complementary allele-specific primer pairs  provided a codominant marker assay  .

 <dig>  bf483039: the primer pair bf483039a_f2/bf483039_cpr <dig>  obtained from the wheat snp database  <cit>  amplified a product of approximately 600 bp from kukri, but no product from excalibur, providing a 7a-specific dominant marker .

when assayed on the excalibur/kukri dh lines, all five est-based markers co-segregated with gwm <dig>  cfa <dig>  wpt- <dig>  schfc <dig>  sts <dig>  psy-a <dig>  lr <dig> and sr <dig> 

molecular marker genotypes of resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars
when assayed on a panel of  <dig> wheat cultivars, the markers wri <dig>  wri <dig>  wri <dig>  and wri <dig> all clearly distinguished excalibur and  <dig> other resistant cultivars  from kukri and  <dig> other susceptible cultivars . marker wri <dig> was able to distinguish excalibur from kukri, and it additionally detected polymorphisms within the resistant and susceptible classes, for which there were three distinct melting curves among the resistant cultivars and at least two others among the susceptible cultivars . this variation within phenotypic classes may reflect sequence polymorphism in homoeologous regions on chromosomes 7b and 7d.

with the cspsy marker, all  <dig> resistant cultivars provided the same result as excalibur, indicating the presence of the psy-a1s or psy-a1t  alleles. none of the susceptible cultivars gave this result. with sequencing of the region in which the psy-a1s or psy-a1t alleles have been reported to differ, it was confirmed that all  <dig> resistant cultivars carry the psy-a1t allele  . with bstn <dig> restriction of the cspsy amplicon, each of the susceptible cultivars was classified as carrying either the psy-a1p  or psy-a1e  allele.

discussion
data on  <dig> progeny lines derived from a cross between excalibur and kukri wheat were used to map the root lesion nematode resistance locus rlnn <dig> as a qtl on 7al, at a position that coincides with several molecular markers and with the rust resistance loci lr <dig> and sr <dig>  as expected, the allele from excalibur conferred greater resistance. for p. neglectus and other parasitic nematodes, resistance refers to the ability of the plant to limit nematode multiplication and thereby reduce the nematode population in the soil. in field experiments, measures of resistance require data on initial and final nematode populations. in inoculated experiments such as the one conducted here, estimates of the final populations are sufficient, given that the initial population is the same for all plants. in this experiment, p. neglectus dna was quantified in the root systems only . accordingly, there could be some unknown confounding from differences in the size of the root system. although root mass was not recorded in this experiment, no obvious differences in root size or density were noticed. given that the moderate resistance of excalibur was originally detected in field experiments  <cit>  and that it has been repeatedly classified as moderately resistant using a range of methods, its resistance cannot be dismissed as simply an artefact of any variation in root size.

our linkage map can be compared to a previously published map  <cit>  based on the relative positions of the ssr marker gwm <dig>  the rust resistance gene lr <dig> and the sts marker schfc <dig> . in addition, the positions of the new markers wri <dig> and wri <dig> can be compared with the position of the rflp locus cdo <dig>  this is because wri <dig> and wri <dig> were designed based on est sequences  with high similarity  to the rice gene loc_os06g <dig>  which was the most significant hit for the cdo <dig> probe.

on the excalibur/kukri map, the rlnn <dig> qtl and four molecular markers  all collocate with lr <dig>  in the earlier map  <cit> , schfc <dig> and cdo <dig> collocated with lr <dig>  but gwm <dig> was  <dig>  cm distal to lr <dig> and rlnn <dig> was about halfway between lr <dig> and gwm <dig>  these discrepancies are probably due to differences in sample size and methodology. the original estimate of the position of rlnn <dig> <cit>  relied upon data from three small samples of progeny lines , each derived from a different cross. each line was classified as either resistant or susceptible to p. neglectus and a consensus mapping approach was used to map rlnn <dig> as a discrete locus. with that approach and those sample sizes, any misclassification of lines or mis-scoring of markers could have considerably expanded the estimated distance between loci. in our work, trait data for p. neglectus resistance, which exhibited bimodal quantitative variation , were used to map rlnn <dig> as a qtl, without any attempt to classify the lines into distinct categories.

we detected a very strong association of resistance against p. neglectus with lr20/sr <dig>  psy-a <dig> and  <dig> collocating molecular markers . of these, sts <dig> had already been recommended  <cit>  for selection of resistance conferred by lr <dig> and/or pm <dig>  but it has the disadvantage of being a dominant marker. the markers schfc <dig>  wpt- <dig> and wri <dig> are also dominant, as is wri <dig> when assayed using gel electrophoresis with scoring of the presence or absence of a 250-bp chromosome 7a-specific amplicon. the markers cspsy, gwm <dig>  cfa <dig>  wri <dig> and wri <dig> can all be assayed as codominant markers using electrophoresis, while wri <dig> and wri <dig> can be assayed as codominant markers using high-resolution melting analysis. we confirmed that cspsy, wri <dig>  wri <dig>  wri <dig> and wri <dig> all distinguish excalibur and  <dig> wheat cultivars that are known to have moderate resistance against p. neglectus and/or to carry lr20/sr <dig>  from kukri and other  <dig> wheat cultivars that lack the resistance conferred by rlnn <dig> and lr20/sr <dig> 

for marker-assisted selection of the root lesion nematode resistance locus rlnn <dig>  we recommend wri <dig> for gel electrophoresis  and wri <dig> for high-resolution melting analysis . the 7a-specific marker wri <dig> is suitable for electrophoretic separation because it involves a substantial  length polymorphism, whilst wri <dig> can be scored as a high-throughput codominant marker using high-resolution melting analysis. either of these markers would also be suitable for selection of the resistance genes lr20/sr <dig> and pm <dig>  they both clearly distinguish between all of the resistant and susceptible materials that we have assayed, so they are likely to be useful across a wide range of wheat breeding germplasm.

other loci within the wheat genome have also been reported to carry sets of co-segregating genes conferring resistance against rusts and powdery mildew. these include the lr34/yr18/pm <dig> locus on chromosome 7d, lr46/yr29/pm <dig> locus on chromosome 1b and lr67/yr <dig> locus on chromosome 4d  <cit> . for the lr34/yr18/pm <dig> locus, a single gene encoding a protein resembling an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette  transporter has been determined to confer resistance against leaf rust, stripe rust  and powdery mildew  <cit> . for lr20/sr <dig> and pm <dig>  mcintosh  <cit>  found that changes to the lr <dig> disease reaction were always accompanied by changes to the sr <dig> reaction, while changes to pm <dig> were independent, indicating that the genetic determinant of pm <dig> resistance is not the same as for lr20/sr <dig>  there is no particular reason to assume that the rlnn <dig> resistance effect is due to the same gene as the lr20/sr <dig> or pm <dig> resistance effects.

while coupling-phase linkage of alleles conferring resistance against multiple pathogens may be advantageous, the linkage of resistance alleles with a psy-a <dig> allele that confers high levels of yellow pigment in wheat flour is disadvantageous for markets that favour white flour. recombinant progeny carrying the nematode resistance gene in combination with a low-pigment allele of psy-a <dig> would be useful in wheat breeding. we have not found any such recombinants. neu et al.  <cit>  have suggested that lr <dig> and pm <dig> are in a region of suppressed recombination. they proposed that this could be due to an alien introgression or a genetic rearrangement. based on the results presented here, it seems likely that rlnn <dig> and psy-a <dig> are also within the region of suppressed recombination. based on previously reported sequence similarity of the psy-a1t allele with b-genome alleles  <cit> , it seems possible that chromosome 7a of excalibur and the other resistant cultivars carries an ancestral translocation from the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7b.

both the observed collocation of the rlnn <dig> qtl with psy-a <dig>  and the hypothesis that these loci are in a region of suppressed recombination are consistent with the experience of wheat breeders in australia, who have not  been able to combine rlnn <dig> resistance with white flour colour. in addition to limiting the opportunity to obtain favourable recombinants between rlnn <dig> and psy-a <dig> for wheat breeding purposes, suppression of recombination could impede positional cloning of rlnn <dig>  lr20/sr <dig> and pm <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the research reported here has clarified the position of the rlnn <dig> locus for resistance against the root lesion nematode p. neglectus, by using a large wheat population to map rlnn <dig> as a qtl, rather than relying upon consensus mapping from small samples. the approach adopted here has clearly shown that rlnn <dig> is very closely linked with the rust resistance gene lr <dig> and sr <dig>  the t allele of the phytoene synthase gene psy-a <dig> and several molecular markers. some of the molecular markers developed here are useful for wheat breeding; they provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against p. neglectus and they have been confirmed to be diagnostic across a panel of wheat cultivars. the results reported here are consistent with the hypothesis that materials with rlnn <dig> resistance carry a chromosome rearrangement on 7al and that this suppresses genetic recombination in this region.
