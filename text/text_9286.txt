BACKGROUND
corneal transparency is crucial for sight. the corneal epithelium and tear film provide the polished outer surface to the cornea enabling it to function as a refractive surface. it is postulated that the continued supply of the epithelial cells is maintained by the sc at the limbus. numbers of studies have provided direct and indirect evidence to support this notion. in  <dig> schermer et al proposed the limbal location of corneal stem cells based on keratin expression of corneal epithelial cells  <cit> . other studies providing evidence of presence of corneal stem cells at limbus include immunohistochemistry studies with known sc markers  <cit> , cell cycling studies characterising the limbal-basal epithelium  <cit>  and electron microscopic features of the basal epithelial cells  <cit> . we have identified a unique structure at the limbus, termed as the limbal epithelial crypt   <cit> . it is a solid cord of cells which extends from the peripheral aspect of the undersurface of interpalisade rete ridges of limbal palisades of vogt into the limbal stroma . there are up to  <dig> or  <dig> such lec, variably distributed along the limbus in each human eye. the lec is analogous to the deep ridges reported in the monkey palm epithelium, where the basal cells of the deep ridges are shown to be the slow cycling stem cells. similar to the deep location of the ridges in the monkey palm, the deep location of the lec would offer physical protection to the sc population  <cit> . our anatomical and immunohistological studies on the lec have emphasised its potential as a repository of sc and as a putative sc niche   <cit> , a concept first proposed by schofield in  <dig>  <cit> . constituents of the niche include tissue cells, and extra-cellular substrates that sustain the sc and control their self renewal and progenitor potential in vivo  <cit> . the niche provides a specialised microenvironment whereby sc are maintained in a state of quiescence. cellular quiescence indicates slow cell cycling or growth arrested phase of the cells. in adult sc it protects against environmental stresses and aids in their maintenance. this property was identified in various cell populations such as in the bulge region of hair follicles  <cit> , intestinal  <cit> , haematopoietic  <cit> , muscle satellite sc  <cit>  and also in the limbus  <cit> . in the hair follicle bulge region two sc compartments have been identified  <cit> ; the quiescent and the activated progenitor cells. the latter regenerates the tissue in homeostatic conditions whereas; quiescent cells act as a reservoir and undergo cell cycling following tissue injury. several studies have identified possible sc markers in the limbal epithelium, using a mechanical dissection technique  <cit> . this method potentially involves the risk of contamination from surrounding tissue. however, laser microdissection  has allowed the isolation of a pure population of both limbal and corneal epithelium in situ  <cit> . studies have also been performed on limbal sub-populations using different techniques including cell cultures  <cit> , collagen adhesiveness  <cit>  and flow cytometry  <cit> . however such methods involving cellular manipulation can influence gene expression. this transcriptional profiling study of laser microdissected os epithelial regions  demonstrates the average characteristic features of each region rather than of the individual cell populations. broadly, this study highlights the presence of undifferentiated and quiescent sc in the lec and "transient cells" or activated progenitor cells and differentiated cells in the cornea  <cit> . the gene expression of limbus is suggestive of presence of quiescent cell population with differentiated suprabasal epithelial cells. our study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the lec is the reservoir of the sc and could serve as a sc niche at the human os.

RESULTS
transcriptome analysis of os regions; 1) lec, 2) limbus, 3) cornea, 4) conjunctiva and 5) lec stroma was performed on four biological replicates for each region, processed from four pairs of cadaver human eyes. poor quality raw data from a corneal and a conjunctival replicate were excluded from the analysis. following normalisation and filtration, a data set of  <dig> genes for  <dig> samples was created.

differentially expressed gene lists
principal component analysis  grouped the biological replicates for each os region. figure  <dig>  shows lec replicates segregated from other os regions. this demonstrated similarity and reproducibility amongst the lec biological replicates. notably, pca of differentially expressed genes between lec and cornea generated distinct gene clusters  as these two regions are at the opposite ends of the epithelial differentiation spectrum. the differentially expressed gene list for each os region demonstrated highest upregulated gene expression in the cornea and most downregulated genes in lec. our findings showed that cornea was the most biologically active zone, whereas the lec was a metabolically dormant zone .

in david  <dig> and ingenuity pathway analysis the mapped gene ids were analysed and the unmapped gene ids were excluded as these were either unknown genes, ests, sequences or duplicated genes.

gene ontology 
considering the model of corneal epithelial regeneration  <cit> , comparative go profiling of lec, limbus and cornea, was performed with the go terms categorised according to specific functions  <cit>  related to stem, transient amplifying  and differentiated cells   <cit> . sc related go terms enriched in lec and limbus were transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter, regulation of transcription from rna polymerase ii promoter and rna binding. compare analysis performed on ingenuity pathway analysis , characterised the 'tissue specific' nature of each region. lec was found to be enriched for undifferentiation processes such as system development , including spermatogenesis , development of haematopoietic progenitor cells  and nervous system development . this suggests that the lec is a more undifferentiated and stem-like region than the adjoining limbus. also down regulation of genes related to tac terms, such as cell proliferation and apoptosis in lec demonstrates its primitive features, unlike limbus. meta-analysis performed by edwards et al on sc microarray data sets have identified go terms related to quiescent and proliferating sc  <cit> . based on this study we have found that lec was specifically enriched for quiescent sc  related terms such as biological regulation, , and regulation of cellular processes  . however limbus  and cornea  were enriched for psc related go terms. additionally cornea and limbus were enriched for tac and dc related go terms .

molecular features of stem/transient cells in os regions
adult sc are quiescent or slow cycling, whilst their immediate progeny the "transient cells"  and subsequent tac undergo active cell cycling, proliferation and differentiation  <cit> . sc related go terms further studied on david  <dig> using functional annotation clustering were: i) transcription factors; ii) self renewal, iii) cell proliferation; iv) cell differentiation; v) negative regulation of cell proliferation; and vi) cell cycling.

i) transcription factors are involved in development and sc functions such as regulating cell fate determination, cell cycling, cell differentiation and response to environment. this go term was significant only to lec  and limbus , . lef <dig> has been shown to be crucial in hair follicle patterning  <cit>  epithelial invagination into mesenchyme  <cit> , and in maintenance of sc quiescence  <cit> , it was found to be upregulated in lec. in contrast, the upregulated transcription factors in limbus were involved in cell proliferation and differentiation . a study on embryonic limbus has demonstrated expression of sod <dig>  exclusively in limbus from  <dig> weeks of development  <cit> . however our microarray study had noted upregulated expression of sod <dig> in lec, limbus and cornea 

ii) self renewal is an important feature of sc maintenance, which isabsent in differentiated cells, weakly expressed in quiescent sc but significantly expressed in proliferating progenitor cells such as mesenchymal stem cells ,  <cit> , intestinal crypts and neural crest cells <cit> . based on other sc studies such as adult sc  <cit> , msc  <cit> , neural sc  <cit>  and neural progenitor cells <cit>  we had found self renewal genes to be predominantly upregulated, in cornea . this is indicative of the presence of early tacs, , with self-renewal properties in cornea. these cells could sustain healthy corneal epithelium independent of limbal/lec support. dua et al  <cit>  have demonstrated the long term conservation of 'central islands' of normal corneal epithelium in patients with total limbal stem cell deficiency as determined clinically by in vivo confocal microscopy. study on cornea of certain mammals by majo et al have demonstrated holoclone capacity of the central cornea and showed that the central corneal epithelium, when transplanted to the limbus, could regenerate corneal epithelium  <cit> . however sun et al have refuted this and argued that true corneal epithelial sc are located primarily at the limbus and not in the central cornea  <cit> . data from this study supports the latter notion, and further refines the preferential location of sc in the lec. an ex-vivo study on organ cultured corneas has demonstrated that the central corneal epithelium depicts a regenerative potential in acute wound healing  <cit> . some of these differences are clearly species dependent and any oligopotent potential of human central cornea is not yet proven. data from the above reports can be reconciled by proposing that the sc are primarily located at the limbus/lec and that the central cornea contains cells that are capable of maintaining a sustained regenerative capacity in the absence of a functional limbus, as well as in the uninjured physiological state. this supports the hypothesis that the transition from a sc to a tac is not abrupt but that there exists a population of cells between these two stages that have an intermediate potential, which we have termed "transient cells", and can migrate to populate the central cornea <cit> . in this study presence of enriched tac related go terms with significant gene expression in cell cycling, self renewal, cell proliferation in cornea  is suggestive of the presence of such "transient cells" with self renewal capacity in this region.

iii) cell proliferation is a property of activated progenitor cells. upregulated genes for cell proliferation in cornea mainly belonged to tgfb <dig> and the ras oncogene family . integrin beta  <dig> binding protein  <dig>  involved in disruption of focal cellular adhesion and mobilisation of stem/transient cells via the c-myc promoter  <cit>  was found to be downregulated in lec. this gene was further validated by real time pcr. lyn a tyrosine kinase molecule involved in cell proliferation of haematopoietic stem cells  <cit>  was also found to be upregulated in limbus.

iv) cell differentiation is a process whereby undifferentiated regenerative cells acquire specialised structural and functional features of mature cells. it was enriched in all the  <dig> groups. of the sixty two, cell differentiation genes identified in lec only five were upregulated  these were involved in maintaining epithelial cells in an undifferentiated state. however, in limbus of the  <dig> genes  <dig> were upregulated, out of which only  <dig> genes were involved in maintaining the cells in undifferentiated state  . krt <dig> has been identified in epidermal stem/progenitor cell population with a role in negative regulation of differentiation  <cit> . lyngholm, m et al identified sod <dig> as a marker of limbal sc  <cit> , it was found to be upregulated in lec, limbus and cornea in this study.

in cornea, of  <dig> genes expressed,  <dig> were upregulated and were involved in differentiation, including terminal differentiation . retinoic acid pathway involved in inhibition of proliferation of corneal tac  <cit>  was also expressed in cornea  . epidermal differentiation complex  is a family of s <dig> related genes crucial for terminal differentiation of human epidermis  <cit> . of the  <dig> known s <dig> genes for edcs four were upregulated in cornea and one in limbus . down-regulation of all these protein complexes was noted in lec. apolipoproteins expressed in differentiated cells were found to be upregulated in cornea and absent or downregulated in the lec and limbus.

v) negative regulation of cell proliferation, also known as 'cell quiescence', was enriched only in lec , and lec stroma . serpinf <dig> a secreted neurotropin with potent antiangiogenic properties upregulated in early passage cells in g <dig> phase as compared to actively proliferating or senescent cells  <cit>  was also found to be upregulated in lec and limbus.

vi) cell cycling  refers to replication and segregation of genetic material followed by cell division. cornea was enriched for this go term . however lec  and limbus  were not enriched for this go term. of the  <dig> genes expressed in cornea,  <dig> were upregulated and mainly represented g <dig>  g2/m phase including cyclins g <dig>  h, c and cyclin d type binding protein.

vii) keratins: krt <dig> a known epidermal sc marker  <cit>  was also found to be upregulated in lec and limbus; hence supporting the evidence of presence of sc in these regions. however limbus also had upregulated expression of krt  <dig> which is expressed by mitotically active basal cells of stratified epithelium  <cit>  and krt  <dig> expressed by suprabasal cells of non-cornified stratified epithelia  <cit> 

molecular features of os sc niche components
adult sc are influenced by their microenvironment or the niche, which regulates their function. niche components identified in os regions included cell adhesion molecules , growth factors, cytokines, extracellular matrix and secreted proteins like neurotropins . e-cadherin, a cam upregulated in lec was previously shown to anchor the sc to the basement membrane and thus aid in sc maintenance  <cit>  and prevent aging of sc  <cit> . siglec <dig> a cam and a cell surface receptor, also upregulated in lec, has been shown to be involved in epithelial regeneration  <cit> . growth factors and cytokines promote proliferation and these were found to be upregulated in cornea . however igfbp <dig>  which is known to influence epidermal regeneration and sc maintenance  <cit>  was found to be upregulated in lec. protection of stem and progenitor cells from oxidative stress is crucial for their sustained maintenance. the go term detoxifier system  which confers antioxidant protection, was enriched in lec , cornea  and limbus . sod <dig> an antioxidant was found to be upregulated in lec, limbus and cornea . it was previously shown to prevent the aging of the sc and their niches in human epidermal keratinocytes  <cit> . we further validated the expression of sod <dig> in these regions with real time pcr.

unlike the cornea, the stroma of the limbus has been shown to maintain the basal epithelial layer in an undifferentiated condition, preserving the stemness of the sc  <cit> . previous studies have shown the presence of a heterogeneous population of cells which include bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells in the limbal stromal region  <cit>  along with the limbal epithelial progenitor cells that have migrated in the process of epithelial mesenchymal transition   <cit> . similarly we had noted round undifferentiated epithelial and spindle like mesenchymal cells in lec stroma on histological sections of lec  . therefore we further studied the gene expression profile encoding the go term "secreted"  for its influence on the lec cells. the absence of cdh <dig> in lec stroma, along with activation of lef1/wnt β-catenin signalling pathways in lec could account for emt which was similarly reported in a previous study on limbal stroma  <cit> . lec stroma was enriched for the tissue metalloproteinase inhibitors , developmental protein flii , antioxidants xpa , duox <dig> , member of gdnf family gfrα <dig>  and lmna a nuclear envelope matrix protein, all of which have been reported to be involved with sc maintenance in other tissues <cit> .

unlike epithelium from different regions, we did not compare the lec stroma with stroma from other regions. this is a limitation of the current work; however, we were able to compare the gene expression of lec stroma with published data on limbal stroma  <cit> . the above mentioned data on lec stroma is supportive of its role in maintenance of the lec cells in undifferentiated state.

canonical pathways on ocular surface
ipa was used to characterise the enriched canonical metabolic and signalling pathways on the os epithelial regions .

i). metabolic pathways
out of  <dig> molecules involved in energy metabolism in cornea,  <dig> were upregulated by more than  <dig> fold indicating active metabolism in this region possibly related to cell division and turn over. likewise, karsten et al  <cit>  have noted upregulated expression of oxidative phosphorylation, purine and protein metabolism in neural progenitor cells denoting increased energy consumption and high protein turn over due to active cellular processes like proliferation and cell migration. cornea also had upregulated expression of related carbohydrate metabolic pathways such as pyruvate, citrate/glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. cornea was also enriched for glutathione metabolism, which is crucial for maintaining corneal transparency, cell membrane integrity and protection against oxidative stress.

studies on side population cells from various tissues have demonstrated that the energy consumption, transcription, translation and metabolism in the undifferentiated and quiescent cells are minimal  <cit> . although oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid, carbohydrate and energy metabolism were found to be enriched in lec, limbus and cornea, the gene expression in these pathways was downregulated in lec and limbus, which supports the presence of undifferentiated and quiescent cells in these regions.

ii). signalling pathways
all the three os regions were enriched for nrf <dig> mediated oxidative stress response . it has a role in cell protection during cell cycling.

sc signalling pathways in the os
fevr et al have demonstrated the importance of wnt receptor-beta catenin signalling pathway in maintaining intestinal crypt structures and sc in their niche  <cit> . it is also crucial for maintaining hsc in a quiescent state and also has a role in sc self renewal  <cit> . we had found upregulated expression of molecules, involved in wnt receptor-beta catenin signalling such as lef <dig>  and cdh <dig> in lec. soluble wnt antagonists  maintain skin bulge sc quiescence <cit>  and also contribute to sc pool maintenance in gastric tissue <cit> . frzb <dig>  a soluble wnt antagonist  was uniquely expressed in lec. frzb <dig> was weakly expressed in microarrays but real-time pcr and immunofluorescence results showed high gene and protein expression of frzb <dig> in lec compared to other regions . planar polar component of wnt pathway, involved in regulation of cell adhesion and motility, was upregulated in cornea only . genes related to the notch  <cit> , jak/stat  <cit> , tgf-beta/bmp  <cit>  and the hedgehog  signalling pathways involved in regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in response to cytokines and growth factors; were found to be upregulated in cornea but not in lec . hes <dig>  a target gene of notch signalling pathway, and rbx <dig> a tgf-beta gene were further validated with real time pcr.

the differentially expressed sc signalling molecules in the os epithelial regions were identified with keggs pathways and reactome. numbers in brackets are fold change. negative values indicate downregulated and positive values are upregulated gene expression. no values denote absence of gene expression in the region.

comparison of gene expression in os epithelium with other sc populations
lef <dig> was found to be crucial for maintaining stemness across various sc populations such as embryonic  <cit> , mesenchymal  <cit>  and epithelial  <cit>  sc. in this study it was uniquely upregulated in lec. myc genes encode for transcription factors, which activate genes influencing cell proliferation, cell growth, apoptosis and sc self-renewal. a study on epidermal sc has noted upregulated expression of myc genes in α6+/mhci+ cells. these cells have characteristic features of tac. however, myc genes were found to be downregulated in α6+/mhci- population of cells consisting of quiescent sc  <cit> . myc genes such as anxa <dig>  tgfb <dig>  fth <dig>  vamp <dig>  krt <dig>  hspb <dig> and ugcg were upregulated in cornea and txn  in limbus but these genes were downregulated in lec. self renewal genes such as fzd <dig>  <cit> , pcna  <cit> , and stat <dig>  <cit>  expressed in psc populations  were also upregulated in cornea.

comparison with other ocular gene expression studies
we had noted some similarities with other os gene expression studies, particularly with regards to krt <dig>  an epithelial sc marker previously identified in limbus  <cit> . krt <dig> was found to be upregulated in lec and limbal epithelium in this study. krt <dig> a suprabasal epithelial marker  <cit> , was also upregulated in limbus. a study comparing the gene profile of limbal and corneal basal cells in mice has noted preferential expression of epithelial sc genes such as fgfr <dig>  and s100a <dig>  in limbus  <cit> , however we had noted upregulation of these molecules in the corneal epithelium. this difference could be related to an interspecies variation. we had also noted upregulated expression of crtac <dig>  ctsl <dig>  nqo <dig>  krt <dig>  mal, igfbp <dig>  igfbp <dig>  s100a <dig> in the cornea. these genes were previously identified by turner et al in their oligonucleotide microarray study on corneal and conjunctival epithelium  <cit> 

validation of microarray data
i) quantitative real-time pcr 
relative quantification of genes of interest  was performed with real time pcr on os regions such as limbus, cornea, and conjunctiva in comparison with lec . frzb <dig> was found to be significantly expressed in lec but was absent in all corneal replicates and insignificantly expressed in limbus and conjunctiva . rbx <dig> was significantly expressed in lec compared to cornea and conjunctiva . significant expression of itgb1bp <dig> was noted between limbus and lec with least expression in lec . significant expression of hes <dig> was noted between lec and cornea and also between lec and conjunctiva . although sod <dig> was significantly expressed in all the os regions posthoc analysis had failed to demonstrate any significant relationship between the groups .

ii) immuno fluorescence
immunofluorescence of frozen tissue sections of os epithelium was performed with frzb <dig> and hes <dig> antibodies . a previous study on hes <dig> expression in mice corneal epithelial stem/progenitor cells has demonstrated that an increased expression of hes <dig> in these cells was crucial for regulation of corneal development and homeostasis  <cit> . intense nuclear staining of hes <dig> was noted in lec and the stromal cells adjacent to lec  as compared to limbus . this evidence is supportive of increased proportion of stem progenitor cells in lec and also in the surrounding lec stroma. few cells in the cornea along the basal epithelium also expressed hes <dig> . nuclear staining with frzb <dig> was prominently seen in the basal epithelium of the lec  and in some areas of the limbus . figure 5h shows absence of frzb <dig> expression in corneal epithelium.

in summary, gene ontology and gene expression patterns noted in this study are suggestive of lec being the most metabolically dormant and undifferentiated region as compared to cornea and limbus. lec was enriched for go terms related to quiescent adult sc. upregulated genes in lec such as cdh <dig>  serpinf <dig>  lef <dig>  frzb <dig>  krt <dig>  sod <dig>  egr <dig> along with beta catenin-wnt signalling pathway are known to be involved in sc maintenance. however limbus and cornea had presence of a mixed population of stem/progenitor, and differentiated cells. similar to lec limbus was metabolically dormant, but also had upregulated sc signalling molecules related to wnt, tgf-beta and hedgehog pathways. cornea had upregulated gene expression related to cell cycling, self renewal, proliferation, cell differentiation growth factors, cytokines and sc signalling genes in the wnt, notch, tgf-beta pathways. this further strengthens the evidence for the presence of long term surviving early tacs  with self renewal capacity in the cornea.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to characterise the in situ gene expression profile of laser microdissected lec and demonstrate the presence of two distinct sc compartments on the os. we have demonstrated, at the transcriptome level that the lec has features that appear to be consistent with that of a quiescent sc niche. although the limbus was metabolically dormant it had a mixed population of differentiated and undifferentiated cells. our study clearly demonstrates that cornea is the most differentiated and proliferating region. the gene expression of this region is also suggestive of the presence of early tacs with self renewal capacity  clinical evidence supports our findings that cornea has the potential to sustain steady state turnover of its epithelium in healthy ocular conditions and lec is the potential reservoir of limbal sc. although a specific limbal sc marker has yet to be elucidated, our findings have identified several genes of interest, which will be further studied as candidate genes to validate their potential as stem cell markers.
