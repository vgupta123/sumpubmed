BACKGROUND
apomixis, asexual reproduction through seed, is widespread among flowering plant families, but low in its frequency of occurrence  <cit> . different from sexual reproduction, apomictically derived embryos develop autonomously from unreduced ovular cells instead of through fertilization of a reduced egg by a sperm. therefore, the progeny of an apomictic plant are genetically identical to the maternal plant  <cit> . this trait can be used as an advanced breeding tool in agriculture since it would enable fixation of hybrid vigor and seed propagation of desirable genotypes  <cit> . no major agriculturally important crop possesses this trait  <cit> . introgression of apomixis into crops through crossing has been impeded by factors such as polyploidy and incompatibility  <cit> . therefore, discovery of genetic mechanisms underlying apomixis will be crucial for manipulation of apomixis for introduction into target crops.

apomixis has been classified into two types and three developmental pathways: gametophytic apomixis, including apospory and diplospory, and sporophytic apomixis, which is also known as adventitious embryony  <cit> . in sporophytic apomixis, an embryo forms directly from an ovular cell and coexists with the zygotic embryo. for gametophytic apomixis, the embryo develops from an unreduced egg in an embryo sac derived through mitosis of either a somatic nucellar cell  or the megaspore mother cell . in apospory, meiosis either does not complete or its products degenerate while aposporous initials  develop from one or more somatic nucellar cells. both genotypes chosen for the present study are aposporous with the trait conferred by genetic elements from pennisetum squamulatum. aposporous p. squamulatum has four-nucleate embryo sacs that lack antipodals  <cit> . apospory in this species is inherited as a dominant mendelian trait  <cit>  and is associated with an approximately  <dig> mb, heterochromatic and hemizygous chromosomal region designated the apospory-specific genomic region ,  <cit> .

many transcriptional approaches to discover the regulatory mechanisms and downstream effects associated with apomixis in many species have been undertaken. in brachiaria, differential display applied to apomictic and sexual ovaries at anthesis yielded two apomixis-specific fragments  <cit>  while a study on earlier sporogenesis and gametogenesis stages identified eleven differentially expressed fragments  <cit> . in paspalum notatum, three expressed sequence tags , all highly similar in sequence, showed differential expression in flowers between apomictic and sexual f <dig> individuals after apospory initiation  <cit> . an additional  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed between sexual and aposporous plants  <cit> . cdna-aflp analysis in paspalum simplex yielded transcripts linked to the apomixis-controlling locus . many of these linked fragments showed stop codons and frameshift mutations, suggesting that they are pseudogenes  <cit> . cdna-aflp was also applied to identify apomixis candidate genes in poa pratensis where  <dig> transcript-derived fragments from spikelets showed qualitative and quantitative expression differences between apomictic and sexual genotypes  <cit> . the full-length sequences of two genes of interest, ppserk  and apostart were obtained and their temporal and spatial expression patterns were assessed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  and in situ hybridization, respectively. while neither one of these two candidate genes showed apomixis- or sexual-specific expression, quantitative differences in expression between apomictic and sexual genotypes were observed  <cit> .

one apomixis-specific gene was identified from a panicum maximum ovule cdna library and shown to be expressed in both aposporous initials and embryos at four days after anthesis  <cit> . additional genes have been identified in panicum through microarray and quantitative rt-pcr analysis  <cit> . in pennisetum ciliare, differential display and suppression subtractive hybridization were used to identify gene expression differences in ovaries of sexual and apomictic accessions  <cit> . supersage, a high-throughput differential display approach, has been used to discover several hundred transcripts with heterochronic shifts in expression between apomictic and sexual ovules at multiple stages of development  <cit> .

formation of aposporous initials is the first and most critical event for occurrence of apospory. because the initiation of sexual and apomictic pathways likely is activated by different signals  <cit> , understanding the molecular mechanism underlying apospory initiation can provide insight into developmental regulation and downstream signaling that results in apomixis. in order to discover candidates for regulating aposporous initial specification in p. squamulatum, we compared two transcriptomes derived from microdissected ovules at the stage of aposporous initial  formation between the apomictic donor parent, p. squamulatum, and its apomictic derivative backcross  <dig>  containing a single p. squamulatum chromosome. initially, a p. glaucum x p. squamulatum f <dig> was crossed with a p. glaucum x p. purpureum f <dig> and hybrid apomictic individuals with good male fertility were selected  <cit> . subsequent backcrosses with tetraploid p. glaucum  <cit>  yielded a bc <dig> line that was shown by fish to contain only one chromosome from p. squamulatum. this single chromosome common to both apomictic bc <dig> and p. squamulatum was the asgr-carrier chromosome based on the transmission of the trait of apomixis and linked molecular markers  <cit> . we hypothesize that candidate genes regulating aposporous initial specification and localized to the asgr will function in both ps <dig> and bc <dig> at the same developmental stage and would be identical in sequence as they are related by descent.

the development and commercialization of new massively parallel sequencing platforms have made transcriptome sequencing faster and more affordable. one platform, developed by  <dig> life sciences corporation, the  <dig> gs-flx sequencer, is capable of producing  <dig> mb of sequence data with an average read length of  <dig> bp per bead in a 7-h run  <cit> . successful applications of these high-throughput sequencing technologies to transcriptome analysis have been reported  <cit> . here we present expressed sequence tags  generated by roche  <dig> high-throughput sequencing technology from dissected ovule tissues staged for aposporous initial formation from two apomictic lines chosen for their common features of apospory and single shared chromosome. alien chromosome  expressed transcripts were identified and tested for asgr linkage and tissue expression.

RESULTS
aposporous ovule-enriched cdna samples for sequencing
ovules from ps <dig> and bc <dig> around the stage of aposporous initial formation were manually dissected from pistils . three biological replicates of  <dig> ovules each were collected for both ps <dig> and bc <dig>  the yield of total rna from each replicate was approximately  <dig> ng from which  <dig> ng was used for one-round of t <dig> rna polymerase-based rna amplification. the average yield from one round of amplification was  <dig> μg. for each library, equal amounts of amplified rna from each replicate were combined and  <dig> μg amplified rna was used for ds-cdna synthesis. the majority of the ds-cdna synthesized from amplified rna was distributed in a size range from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp .

assembly of sequences from ps <dig> and bc <dig> aposporous ovules
two aposporous ovule transcriptomes, one from ps <dig> and the other from bc <dig>  were sequenced using the high-throughput 454-flx sequencer. the ps <dig> transcriptome library contained  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> base pairs  and the bc <dig> transcriptome library contained  <dig>  reads with an average read length of  <dig> bp. assembly by the multifunctional inertial reference assembly  program  <cit>  resulted in  <dig>  contigs from the ps <dig> ovule transcriptome library and  <dig>  contigs from the bc <dig> ovule transcriptome library . the number of reads per contig ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> in ps <dig> assemblies and  <dig> to  <dig> in bc <dig> assemblies with the majority having less than  <dig> reads per assembly in both cases. the numbers of singletons in ps <dig> and bc <dig> libraries were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

blast2go
contigs from both transcriptome libraries were analyzed for biological functions using blast2go  <cit> . for both libraries, the use of t <dig> amplified rna biased the sequencing data toward the 3' utr region as shown by the blastx results of the blast2go analysis.  <dig>  ps <dig> contigs  and  <dig>  bc <dig> contigs  had hits against the nr database of ncbi with an e-value cut-off of e- <dig>  for both libraries, 90% of the top blastx hits were, in order, to sorghum bicolor, zea mays or oryza sativa proteins. blast2go was able to fully annotate  <dig>  ps <dig> contigs and  <dig>  bc <dig> contigs .

to obtain additional functional data from the shorter reads, a study was initiated to test whether the most significant blastn est_other database hit  could be used as a surrogate longer sequencing read for the ps26/bc <dig> transcripts. approximately 55%  of the bc <dig> contigs had an est_others hit ≤e- <dig>  blast2go analysis was used for the bc8_est_others best matches and compared with blast2go mapping results for the  <dig> annotated bc <dig> contigs. the majority  of the bc <dig> contigs had blast2go mapping data identical to the corresponding bc8_est_others mapping data while only 5% of the bc <dig> contigs had >50% non-matching mapping data. given the large percentage of identical and/or highly matching mapping data, a library of ps26_est_others was also established using the same parameters as bc8_est_others. approximately 53%  of the ps <dig> contigs had an est_others hit ≤e- <dig>  blast2go was able to fully annotate  <dig>  ps26_est_others contigs and  <dig>  bc8_est_others contigs.

a fisher's exact test  was done to identify significant differences of expression data between the ps <dig> and bc <dig> libraries and the ps26_est_others and bc8_est_others libraries. at a false discovery rate  ≤ <dig> ,  <dig> go terms were identified as different between the ps <dig> and bc <dig> libraries . however, when the ps26_est_others and bc8_est_others libraries were compared at fdr < <dig>  , only  <dig> go terms  were identified as differentially expressed between the two libraries .

in silico identification of putative alien expressed transcripts
when mira-assembled contigs from the two libraries were analyzed by blastn with ps <dig> sequences as queries and bc <dig> sequences as the database, a total of  <dig> comparisons were obtained with 100% sequence identity across an overlapping region ≥ <dig> bp corresponding to  <dig> unique contigs from the ps <dig> database and  <dig> unique contigs from the bc <dig> database. the  <dig> ps26/bc <dig> contigs were further analyzed by aligning the corresponding ps <dig> and bc <dig> contigs with each other, resulting in  <dig> inter-genotype contigs with no mismatches that were aligned. the average overlapping regions of the  <dig> inter-genotype contigs was  <dig> bp  with an average number of  <dig> sequence reads. the remaining ps26/bc <dig> contigs, while initially identified by blastn as having 100% identity over a region > <dig> bp, did not continue to share sequence similarity outside this region and therefore did not align over the whole contig.

mapping and predicted function of putative asgr-carrier chromosome transcripts
up to four primer pairs per contig were used to test for linkage of the  <dig> contigs to the asgr-carrier chromosome. sequence characterized amplified region  primer pairs were designed based on the ps <dig> contig sequence . after screening by pcr against ps <dig>  ia4x , n <dig>  and a small number of progeny from apomictic bc <dig> segregating for mode of reproduction,  <dig> contigs showed specific amplification from ps <dig> and apomictic bc <dig> but no amplification from ia4x or sexual bc <dig> individuals  establishing linkage of  <dig> contigs to the asgr-carrier chromosome. single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis  and a caps screen using two to four restriction enzymes was applied to the  <dig> primer pairs which amplified products in both ps <dig> and ia4x dna. four additional contigs could be linked to the asgr-carrier chromosome using sscp analysis . the caps screen identified a haeiii polymorphism for ps26_c <dig>  a transcript also mapped by sscp.

the one contig mapped to the asgr is shown in bold. +: positive amplification; -: no amplification; pf: primer failure; np: no polymorphism available for mapping; n/a: not assayed. primer sequences and annealing temperatures can be found in additional file  <dig> - table s <dig> 

the markers from the  <dig> asgr-carrier chromosome-linked contigs were initially screened on a limited number of apomictic  and sexual  f1s for mapping to the asgr. this resulted in one contig, ps26_c <dig>  showing tight linkage to the asgr as the primers amplified dnas from only apomictic f1s but not sexual f1s . the remaining primer sets did not show amplification specificity in the f <dig> population; both apomictic and sexual progeny amplified.

a larger f <dig> population of  <dig> individuals  was used to map the ps26_c <dig> and ps26_c <dig> transcripts. ps26_c <dig> was mapped based on the haeiii polymorphism found in the caps screen between ps <dig> and ia4x and also seen in the f <dig> population. ps26_c <dig> is unlinked to the asgr as the caps polymorphism segregated 1: <dig> in the population but with  <dig> sexual and  <dig> apomictic individuals containing the marker. in comparison, the ps26_c <dig> primers remained specific to the  <dig> apomictic plants and did not amplify the  <dig> sexual plants.

blastx searches against ncbi databases were carried out for the  <dig> ps26/bc <dig> asgr-carrier chromosome linked contigs and best protein hits for  <dig> contigs are summarized in table  <dig>  because the sequences are 3' biased, a blastn analysis against the expressed sequence tag  database at ncbi with the remaining  <dig> ps26/bc <dig> contigs was done to find potential orthologs from other species. at an e-value cutoff of e- <dig>   <dig> contigs had est hits . a blastx was performed using these est sequences to determine if tentative protein functions could be obtained, and the best hits are listed in table  <dig>  the remaining  <dig>  contigs did not have hits by either blastx or blastn; therefore, they were considered orphan genes.

potential functions of the inter-genotype contigs sharing 100% identity between ps <dig> and bc <dig> ovule transcripts which could be mapped to the asgr-carrier chromosome based on the best hit of the contigs to protein  or nucleotide  sequences in ncbi databases.

in order to generate contiguous sequence that might enhance the potential for mapping of contigs in the f <dig> population and to extract a longer cdna sequence for ps26_c <dig>  a cdna library containing ~ <dig>  phage plaques was constructed from apomictic bc <dig> mature ovary and anther rna since all  <dig> asgr-carrier chromosome transcripts showed expression in these tissues by rt-pcr. screening of the cdna library with  <dig> asgr-carrier chromosome transcript probes yielded hybridization signals for  <dig> probes. pcr screening with the asgr-carrier chromosome-specific primers identified  <dig> asgr-carrier chromosome clones and one clone for ps26_c <dig>  additional sequence for these clones was generated.

the ps26_c <dig> clone contained a  <dig> bp insert. blastx analysis identified similarity to a hypothetical protein sorbidraft_10g <dig>  and oryza sativa hypothetical protein osj_ <dig>  over an ~ <dig> bp region. in both sorghum and rice, the area of similarity overlapped a pfam03004: transposase_ <dig> domain for those proteins. the remaining ps26_c <dig> clone sequence was unique. nine primer sets were designed from nine ps <dig> contigs to span introns based on predicted splicing of best hits to sorghum. five primer sets gave strong amplification of ps <dig> genomic dna. these amplicons were cloned and sequenced to identify snps within the ps <dig> genomic alleles. caps markers could be designed for ps26_c <dig>  and ps26_c <dig> . mapping of  <dig> apomictic and  <dig> sexual f1s did not show tight linkage of these contigs to the asgr.

expression profiles of asgr-linked expressed transcripts by rt-pcr
rt-pcr with rna extracted from apomictic bc <dig> leaf, root, anther, and ovary tissues was completed for the  <dig> candidate genes mapped to the asgr-carrier chromosome. forty-seven were expressed in all four organ types examined . however, one putative mads-domain containing transcription factor, corresponding to contig ps26_c <dig>  showed amplification only in anther and ovary tissues  and contig ps26_c <dig>  a putative lon protease, showed expression in all organs except anther.

discussion
transcriptional profiling has been extensively used for gene discovery in plants because the absence of introns greatly enhances the information content of the data set and eases data interpretation  <cit> . combined with  <dig> high-throughput sequencing technology, transcriptome sequencing has become an approach to understand molecular events at the gene expression level on a genome-wide scale. many successful applications of  <dig> sequencing technology in transcriptome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism  discovery have been reported  <cit>  and supported our use of this technology for ovule transcriptome sequencing.

in contrast to studies aimed at identifying genes involved in apomictic reproduction through the identification of differences between apomictic and sexual genotypes, our study compared two apomictic lines for identical transcripts. we previously reported that the asgr is sufficient to induce apomixis in sexual pearl millet  <cit> ; therefore, the trait of apomixis in bc <dig> is conferred by the asgr-carrier chromosome from ps <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, we have attempted to identify candidate genes regulating the first step of apomixis, aposporous initial development, by transcriptome analysis of ovules from both ps <dig> and bc <dig>  the ovules were collected at the stage of aposporous initial development, which ranged from no apparent apospory initials  to distinct aposporous initials observed . by pooling ovules over this range of development our objective was to minimize the chance of missing genes involved in the pathway of apomixis initiation since we would predict transcription prior to, and perhaps beyond, apospory initial formation.

the two ovule transcriptomes generated had an average read length of ~ <dig> bp, shorter than the average read length of 200- <dig> bases for the  <dig> gs flx sequencer. the shorter than expected reads could have been due to a combination of factors in preparing the samples for sequencing such as the t7-based antisense rna amplification method, the conversion of antisense rna to cdna, or during the shearing process of the cdna to prepare the sequencing library. another possible factor is the species itself. it has been shown that the average read length can vary among different organisms due to differences in at/gc content  <cit> .

even with short reads and using stringent comparison conditions to decrease the number of false positive joins between highly similar but not identical transcripts from the two species,  <dig> putative asgr-carrier chromosome candidate expressed genes were identified in silico, of which  <dig> have confirmed linkage to the asgr-carrier chromosome. the 3' bias of the t <dig> amplified transcripts helped in the design of primers to discriminate between p. squamulatum and the bc <dig> pearl millet genome containing one p. squamulatum chromosome. our sequencing strategy helped remove, at least to a chromosomal level, the difficulties associated with candidate gene identification by comparative gene expression analysis in apomictic and sexual systems which lack, due to the apomictic process, an ability to generate isogenic lines that vary only in their mode of reproduction. primer specificity for  <dig> transcripts was not seen when we attempted to map scars to the asgr using a f <dig> population containing many p. squamulatum chromosomes. the additional sequence generated by the phage cdna clones allowed mapping of two more transcripts in the f <dig> population. greater sequence length would be advantageous for mapping of the asgr-carrier chromosome transcripts to the asgr locus.

the use of the gene ontology software blast2go allowed comparison of both the ps <dig> and bc <dig> libraries and the ps26_est_others and bc8_est_others libraries created by using the most significant est_others blastn result as a surrogate for our sequences. the ps <dig> and bc <dig> transcriptomes were almost identical on a level  <dig> biological process comparison. while many biological go terms showed expression level differences when comparing the ps <dig> and bc <dig> libraries, all but seven became non-significant when the ps26_est_others and bc8_est_others libraries were compared. six of the transcriptional differences noted belong to genes involved in either ribosomal or translational functions. this difference may be caused by ploidy level difference of ps <dig>  and bc <dig> . mira assembly will separate alleles of genes into different contigs. more ps <dig> allelic transcripts for genes involved in either ribosomal or translational functions may be expressed in ps <dig> than in bc <dig> thus leading to a higher transcript difference between the libraries.

expression analysis of the asgr-carrier chromosome linked genes in bc <dig> tissue was used to identify transcripts specific to reproductive tissue. all but two asgr-carrier chromosome transcripts showed constitutive expression in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. the one reproduction-specific transcript  did not map to the asgr. the transcript which could be mapped to the asgr shows similarity to "hypothetical" proteins in both sorghum and rice containing a transposase_ <dig> domain. previous sequencing of bac clones linked to the asgr have shown a large number of both type i and type ii transposons at the locus  <cit> ; therefore, it is not surprising that we identified an asgr-linked transposon transcript in our study.

CONCLUSIONS
our data show that the combination of selecting specific reproductive tissues and sequencing with  <dig> high-throughput sequencing technology is a promising approach for identification of genes involved in different developmental events and that a need for longer transcript contigs will be a requirement to allow for easier mapping of these transcripts. given the rapid advancements in next-generation sequencing technologies that enable very deep sequence coverage and paired-end reads, it is likely that the fine tissue dissection requiring rna amplification of starting materials now could be eliminated to favor longer transcript assemblies.
