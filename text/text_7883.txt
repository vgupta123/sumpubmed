BACKGROUND
in the vertebrate pancreas, the increase in endocrine cells during late and post-embryonic development is caused by de novo progenitor differentiation and proliferation of pre-existing endocrine cells  <cit> . in mice, the majority of endocrine cells arise after embryonic day  <dig>  , from cells located in the branched epithelium of the dorsal and ventral buds. these second wave endocrine cells delaminate, migrate and cluster into numerous islets  <cit> . in addition, early-forming, first wave endocrine cells of unknown function appear before epithelial branching at e <dig> , but do not contribute to mature islets  <cit> . only recently, two waves of endocrine cell development were also observed in zebrafish. similarly, cells with a mature gene expression profile only form during the second wave, while the early cells do not contribute to the later bulk of mature beta cells that produce insulin at high levels  <cit> .

the zebrafish pancreas arises from two progenitor domains called the dorsal bud and ventral bud , which have distinct differentiation potentials  <cit> . the db forms before  <dig> h post fertilization , and consists of clustered early endocrine cells called the principal islet. the vb arises from the gut tube after  <dig> hpf, and these cells migrate to engulf the principal islet  <cit> . cells of the vb expand posteriorly to form the pancreatic tail and differentiate into exocrine cells, duct cells, and late arising  endocrine cells. the ventral bud-derived ductal system includes the attachment of the pancreas to the gut ), and a branching network in the expanding pancreatic tail ). late endocrine cells in zebrafish appear to originate from progenitors located in or adjacent to the ductal system and contribute to expansion of the large principal islet and also coalesce to form scattered smaller secondary islets  <cit> . the emergence of late endocrine cells is considered analogous to the second wave of endocrine cell differentiation in mammals  <cit> .

pancreas formation requires the function of a highly conserved network of hierarchically expressed transcription factors. among them, pdx <dig> and hb <dig>  play key roles in pancreas and beta cell development, as demonstrated by loss-of-function studies in mice  <cit> . pdx <dig> is expressed throughout the early pancreatic progenitor domain and is highly expressed in mature beta cells. pdx <dig> is not required for the formation of first wave endocrine cells in mice  <cit> , but promotes second wave islet cell formation  <cit> . hb <dig> is expressed in a pattern overlapping with pdx <dig> in the early progenitors of the dorsal and ventral buds  <cit> . after formation of pancreatic buds, hb <dig> is initially downregulated, and is activated again in differentiating beta cells  <cit> . loss of function hb9-/- mice lack the dorsal bud, while ventral bud-derived islets are smaller and have decreased numbers of incompletely differentiated beta cells  <cit> .

in zebrafish, morpholino knockdown approaches have been used to study pancreatic function of hb <dig> and pdx <dig>  <cit> . following morpholino-mediated pdx <dig> knockdown, embryos showed delayed appearance of both exocrine and endocrine cells but displayed an almost normal overall structure of the pancreas by  <dig> days post fertilization   <cit> . this reported recovery raises questions about the requirement for pdx <dig> in progenitor specification in zebrafish. hb <dig> is expressed broadly in the endoderm during early somite stages and becomes restricted to insulin-producing beta cells after onset of endocrine differentiation at  <dig> hpf. morpholino knockdown analysis revealed a requirement for hb <dig> in early beta cells  <cit> . the coexpression of pdx <dig> and hb <dig> in beta cell progenitors suggests possible functional interactions that have as yet not been assessed.

differentiation of beta cells from progenitors is coordinated with morphogenetic events that include delamination of precursors from the ductal epithelium, migration and islet assembly. real-time imaging of this dynamic process has not been previously achieved, as direct observation is prevented by the deep interior location of the pancreas. such studies are feasible in transparent zebrafish embryos. however, as visual access to the developing gut is obstructed by the large yolk cell, observation of endocrine cell emergence requires the implementation of new imaging approaches.

regulation of cell fate decisions in pancreatic endocrine progenitors involves notch-regulated lateral inhibition that in mouse leads to increased ngn <dig> expression in a subset of cells within the nascent duct epithelium and induction of proendocrine transcription factors such as neurod  <cit> . although the presumed zebrafish ngn <dig> ortholog appears not to be functionally equivalent to the mouse gene based on timing and localization of expression  <cit> , neurod is expressed in early precursors that give rise to all endocrine cells in both mouse and zebrafish  <cit> . in mouse, neurod was found to have the capacity to drive endocrine differentiation in pancreatic progenitors  <cit> . neurod expression is maintained in insulin-positive beta cells, while it is downregulated in the other endocrine cell types  <cit> .

in this study, we aimed to achieve a better understanding of beta cell progenitor specification and behavior, and the dependence of these processes on pdx <dig> and hb <dig>  after early reduction of beta cell numbers following morpholino-mediated depletion of hb <dig> or pdx <dig>  there is recovery of insulin expression at late stages. in contrast, loss of both pdx <dig> and hb <dig> leads to an essentially complete and persistent absence of beta cells. a detailed analysis of endocrine precursors in wild-type and morpholino-treated embryos using a neurod:egfp transgenic line revealed cooperative activity of hb <dig> and pdx <dig> in establishing beta cell fate. importantly, we define a requirement for pdx <dig> in latent, duct-associated, notch-responsive progenitors responsible for the production of second wave endocrine cells. these investigations were facilitated by the establishment of new protocols for in vivo timelapse imaging that allow visualization of delaminating and migrating endocrine precursors at high resolution.

RESULTS
beta cell loss following simultaneous knockdown of hb <dig> and pdx1
to determine how beta cell differentiation is affected by the depletion of hb <dig> and pdx <dig>  we examined insulin  expression over a time window of  <dig> days following morpholino  injection. consistent with previous studies  <cit> , hb <dig> and pdx <dig> mo-treated embryos  analyzed by rna in situ hybridization at  <dig> hpf had a marked decrease in ins expression . as seen in previous analyses of pdx <dig> morphants, we now show that also in hb <dig> morphants there was a substantial recovery of beta cell development and ins expression by  <dig> dpf .

we next asked the question whether hb <dig> and pdx <dig> might cooperate in beta cell formation by coinjecting embryos with hb <dig> and pdx <dig> morpholinos. this resulted in an almost complete lack of ins expression at  <dig> hpf . this phenotype persisted, and at  <dig> dpf and  <dig> dpf, hb9/pdx <dig> morphants showed virtually no ins expression .

to exclude that pancreatic development is globally disrupted in the double morphant, we examined expression of the exocrine marker carboxypeptidase a . as in the pdx <dig> morphants  <cit> , hb9/pdx <dig> double morphants show substantial development of exocrine tissue at  <dig> dpf . we also asked whether pdx <dig> expression returns at later stages in morpholino-injected embryos, by examining pdx <dig> protein in morphants. at  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf, pdx <dig> expression is entirely absent in the developing gut and pancreas of pdx <dig> morphants . at  <dig> hpf during normal development, pdx <dig> is strongly expressed in cells of the islet with lower expression in the exocrine pancreas , while pdx <dig> morphants have low levels of pdx <dig> protein in exocrine pancreas and islet at this stage . thus, the morphant is not completely devoid of pdx <dig> at late stages, but a low level of expression is observed that allows rescue of exocrine development and may account for the recovery of beta cells.

perturbed endocrine precursor formation in hb9/pdx <dig> knockdown embryos
two mechanisms could account for the persistent absence of beta cells in the hb9/pdx <dig> double morphants: endocrine precursors may not be specified, or they may fail to differentiate. to distinguish these possibilities we analyzed green fluorescent protein  expression in morphant embryos transgenic for tgbacnl <dig>  <cit> . these fish express enhanced green fluorescent protein  integrated into the neurod locus contained in a bacterial artificial chromosome  by homologous recombination. egfp expression has been reported to recapitulate neurod expression in the nervous system. we now confirm that egfp in tgbacnl <dig> embryos is first expressed in dispersed cells of the prepancreatic endoderm, which migrate posteriorly and cluster to form the principal islet by  <dig> hpf . in a subset of cells there is coexpression of endocrine hormones , recapitulating endogenous neurod expression in islet cell precursors  <cit> . in addition, the stability of egfp allowed us to trace endocrine precursors during maturation after the downregulation of the endogenous neurod.

to assess endocrine precursor specification in hb9/pdx <dig> double morphants, we quantified pancreatic egfp+ cells at  <dig> hpf, that is, before the emergence of the ventral bud. at  <dig> hpf, double morphant embryos displayed a slightly reduced number of egfp positive cells as compared to controls . in addition, while egfp+ cells in control embryos formed a compact islet , 50% of double morphants  showed loosely clustered or even widely separated gfp+ cells , suggesting disrupted migration. thus, early endocrine cells were specified in these morphants, albeit at reduced levels, and the residual endocrine cells displayed defects in migration.

we next examined endocrine cell specification and differentiation at  <dig> hpf, after the fusion of dorsal and ventral buds. for this analysis we used embryos that were double transgenic for tgbacnl <dig> and tgm <dig>  enabling simultaneous visualization of progenitors and differentiated beta cells by egfp and dsred, respectively, and in addition immunostained the embryos for pancadherin to delineate gut morphology . in control embryos, the average number of egfp+ cells increased by 20% between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf , but these remained essentially constant in number in the double morphants . control embryos had an average of  <dig> egfp+/dsred+ cells , compared to double morphants that had few to no dsred+ cells  . furthermore, 47%  of double morphant embryos showed clusters of egfp+/dsred- cells located at a distance from the islet and outside of the pancadherin stained gut epithelium . only one ectopic egfp+ cell was seen in a single control embryo , and this cell also displayed robust dsred expression . as dsred takes  <dig> h to reach its half maximal fluorescence intensity  <cit> , this likely represents a rare displaced early rather than a late beta cell. in summary, our analyses show that early endocrine cell specification occurred in hb9/pdx <dig> double morphants, and therefore a deficit in differentiation contributes to the absence of ins-expressing cells at later developmental stages. in addition, the formation of second wave endocrine cells was disrupted, as the number of neurod:egfp cells did not increase after  <dig> hpf in double morphants.

loss of late forming neurod:egfp cells in pdx <dig> morphants
we next analyzed neurod:egfp cells in the islet of morphant embryos at  <dig> dpf to determine if emergence of second wave endocrine cells was delayed. strikingly, hb9/pdx <dig> double morphants displayed a persistently low number of neurod:egfp+ cells in the principal islet, which even appears reduced relative to earlier time points when only cells in the vicinity of islet and extrapancreatic duct were counted , and distal cells outside of the gut were not included .

as pdx <dig> is required in second wave endocrine progenitors in mouse  <cit> , we hypothesized that the defect in late endocrine cell formation in double morphants could be due to loss of pdx <dig> only. to assess the individual contributions of pdx <dig> and hb <dig> to late endocrine cell formation, we quantitated neurod cell number in single morphants. at  <dig> dpf, egfp+ cells in hb <dig> morphants were only slightly reduced relative to controls, whereas in pdx <dig> morphants egfp+ cells were reduced by 50%, similar to the number observed in double morphants . in addition, control embryos had egfp+ cells located anterior to the islet that were absent in double morphant embryos . these cells occupied a position corresponding to that of previously described late-arising endocrine cells  <cit> . strikingly, in pdx <dig> morphants but not in hb <dig> morphants, the anterior egfp+ cells were also absent . thus, the formation of late endocrine cells specifically depends on pdx <dig>  while early endocrine cells were specified in the absence of pdx <dig> or hb <dig> .

we also confirmed the persistent deficiency in new endocrine cell formation by examining neurod:egfp+ cells in the principal islet at  <dig> dpf in pdx <dig> morphants as compared to control embryos, and found that neurod:egfp cells remained dramatically reduced . furthermore, in pdx <dig> morphants , neurod:egfp+ cells in the principal islet expressed pdx <dig> at low levels, as compared to robust expression in controls . as ins-expressing cells have increased by  <dig> dpf in pdx <dig> morphants , these beta cells originated from early specified, first wave endocrine precursors that differentiate under conditions of deficient pdx <dig> 

extrapancreatic duct-associated neurod:egfp cells are migratory endocrine precursors
second wave endocrine cells arise in association with the developing ductal epithelium  <cit> . to precisely localize the site at which pdx1-dependent anterior endocrine precursors arise, we immunostained tgbacnl1;tgm <dig> embryos at  <dig> dpf for the duct marker 2f <dig>  neurod-expressing cells were found along the extrapancreatic duct , showed coexpression of 2f <dig>  and even appeared to be emerging from the duct, with elongated processes characteristic of delaminating and migrating cells . in support of their identity as endocrine precursors, occasionally such anterior neurod:egfp cells expressed low levels of ins:dsred and thus correspond to newly differentiating beta cells . this was confirmed by insulin  antibody staining .

to document the emergence of these anterior endocrine cells, we developed a timelapse imaging technique based on a method described for imaging the central nervous system  <cit> . the large yolk cell, which normally obstructs the deeply located pancreas, was paralyzed and then extracted to establish a clear ventral view. this procedure did not interfere with morphogenetic processes. using this novel method, we performed timelapse analysis of tgbacnl1;tgzf <dig> embryos at  <dig> dpf. in double transgenic embryos, we recorded active delamination and clustering of neurod:egfp-positive cells adjacent to the extrapancreatic duct and migration of cells towards the principal islet . thus, our method allows the visualization of dynamic cell behaviors in the context of the developing organ in real time, and unambiguously demonstrates that new endocrine cells emerge from the duct epithelium and join the principal islet.

having established that second wave endocrine precursors emerge from the duct, we analyzed if their absence in pdx <dig> morphants could be caused by a global duct defect. at  <dig> hpf, duct development appeared normal in morphant embryos, as demonstrated by a normal pattern of gfp-labeled duct cells in tgia <dig> transgenics  <cit>  . furthermore, tgzf <dig> embryos, in which egfp outlines membranes of the gut epithelium, revealed normal cellular structure of the extrapancreatic duct in pdx <dig> morphants as compared to controls . we examined pdx <dig> expression in these embryos to address whether pdx <dig> might have a role within the duct as new endocrine cells emerge. pdx <dig> was highly expressed throughout the extrapancreatic duct and proximal pancreas in control embryos, while expression was very weak in pdx <dig> morphants . this analysis indicates that depletion of pdx <dig> eliminated the ability of duct-associated cells to give rise to endocrine precursors and argues against an overall perturbation of the duct.

post-mitotic origin of late emerging endocrine cells
we next asked the question whether late endocrine precursors arise from a mitotically active cell population. we tested this by incubating control and pdx <dig> morphant tgbacnl <dig> embryos with nucleotide analog edu from  <dig> hpf to  <dig> hpf. this extended incubation is expected to label dividing neurod+ endocrine precursors and dividing duct cells whose progeny differentiated into neurod-expressing endocrine cells. at  <dig> hpf, an average of  <dig>  neurod:egfp cells/embryo in control embryos were edu positive, and their number in pdx <dig> morphants was not significantly different . in addition, rare edu+/neurod+ cells were found at the periphery of the islet and distal to the islet, along the extrapancreatic duct in control embryos . in summary, the neurod+/edu+ double-labeled cells  cannot account for the appearance of ten additional neurod-expressing cells that emerge in embryos between  <dig> hpf and  <dig> hpf. furthermore, most neurod+ cells outside of the principal islet were edu-, indicating that late endocrine cells appearing after  <dig> hpf arose from post-mitotic precursors. the pdx <dig> morphant showed a similar low number of neurod+/edu+ cells, which were all associated with the islet . our data therefore suggest that late endocrine cells emerge predominantly from a postmitotic cell type.

as proliferating cells were found directly adjacent to the neurod:egfp+ islet, we next used the tggz <dig> allele that labels exocrine pancreas  <cit>  to define their identity. incubation of embryos from  <dig> to  <dig> hpf with edu, followed by a 12-h chase, resulted in extensive edu labeling of the gfp+ exocrine pancreas in control as well as in pdx <dig> morphant embryos . therefore, ventral bud cells forming the exocrine pancreas are highly proliferative during this time period, and in pdx <dig> morphants no general proliferation defect exists in the pancreas. we conclude that beta cell recovery in pdx <dig> morphants is not accompanied by activated proliferation in progenitors or differentiated beta cells, but occurs through delayed precursor differentiation.

notch-responsive beta cell progenitors require pdx1
the zebrafish intrapancreatic duct is a ventral bud derivative containing notch-responsive endocrine progenitors that begin to differentiate and assemble into secondary islets after  <dig> dpf  <cit> . blocking notch signaling after  <dig> dpf was previously shown to induce differentiation of endocrine cells from duct-associated progenitors  <cit> . we assessed whether the latent endocrine progenitors associated with the intrapancreatic duct also arise in a pdx1-dependent manner.

to visualize the emergence of endocrine cells from the intrapancreatic duct, we first used a notch inhibitor -l-alanyl]-s-phenylglycine t-butyl ester ) to induce endocrine differentiation and neurod:egfp expression in latent progenitors. in control experiments, treatment of tgbacnl <dig> embryos with dapt from  <dig> to  <dig> dpf caused an increase of cells in the principal islet and a fourfold increase of gfp labeled cells within the pancreatic tail as compared to vehicle-treated larvae . overlapping expression of ins and gfp following dapt treatment confirmed that newly-induced neurod:egfp cells in the pancreatic tail can differentiate into beta cells .

we next analyzed if these notch-responsive cells were present in pdx <dig> and hb <dig> morphants. we found virtually no neurod:egfp induction following dapt treatment in pdx <dig> morphants, while dapt treatment in hb <dig> morphants resulted in an increased number of neurod:egfp+ cells similar to controls . immunostaining for duct marker 2f <dig> indicated that intrapancreatic duct formation in pdx <dig> morphants was comparable to controls . overall, this indicates that notch-responsive progenitors for late-forming endocrine cells, that contribute new cells to both principal islet expansion and secondary islet formation, require pdx <dig> .

discussion
in this work, we determined that both hb <dig> and pdx <dig> have roles in early beta cell formation and that pdx <dig> is distinctly required for second wave endocrine progenitor specification, which generates endocrine cells that expand the principal islet and form secondary islets. prior studies of pdx <dig> morphant zebrafish did not quantitatively assess endocrine cell dynamics, and therefore the requirement for pdx <dig> in formation of progenitors for late endocrine cells went unrecognized. our new imaging approach allowed us to visualize the behavior of emerging endocrine cells in real time and define the source of the late endocrine progenitor cells. specifically, we show that they originate and delaminate from the ductal epithelium in a process that resembles formation of second wave endocrine cells in mammals. our findings identify a genetic requirement for formation of late endocrine cells, establish the site where the latent postmitotic cell type that gives rise to the endocrine progenitor resides, and describe a novel method to visualize morphogenetic events that occur during islet formation.

sources of beta cell recovery
embryos deficient in either pdx <dig> or hb <dig> alone display an initial decrease in ins expression, followed by restoration of some ins-expressing cells by  <dig> dpf. we show here that in double morphants such a recovery does not occur, and define pdx <dig> and hb <dig> dependent steps in the generation and differentiation of two distinct endocrine cell populations arising in the early and late embryo. the early appearance of neurod:egfp-expressing islet cells demonstrated that committed, first wave endocrine cells of the dorsal bud were specified despite the absence of hb <dig> and/or pdx <dig>  by contrast, second wave endocrine cells strictly depend on pdx <dig>  the apparent recovery of beta cells in pdx <dig> morphants thus results from delayed differentiation of early arising, dorsal bud-derived endocrine precursors in conditions of severely reduced pdx <dig>  since we have detected hb <dig> in ventral bud-derived beta cells , and hb <dig> knockout causes global beta cell deficits in mouse, delayed beta cell differentiation in hb <dig> morphants can be explained by restoration of protein function due to dilution of morpholino at the time when late endocrine cells emerge.

progenitors for late endocrine cell expansion
during organ development, progenitors are often set aside during the early stages to undergo later expansion and differentiation. in prior studies of beta cell proliferation during zebrafish embryogenesis using nucleotide analogs or proliferating cell nuclear antigen  antibody, dividing beta cells were detected only very rarely or not at all  <cit> . to analyze and define the proliferative status of cells generating the late-arising endocrine cells, we used a protocol in which embryos were exposed to a long pulse of edu covering the time window when late endocrine cells start emerging . this captures all cell divisions and also labels cells that proliferate prior to endocrine differentiation. indeed, due to the prolonged labeling time, we observed a higher proportion of cells that had undergone proliferation as compared to previous studies, indicating that dividing progenitors that gave rise to beta cells as well as the rare beta cell mitoses were revealed. nevertheless, the low number of edu+ endocrine precursors and beta cells that we detected in normal development shows that the vast majority of late arising endocrine cells  have not undergone mitosis during the labeling period. therefore, these cells differentiate directly from a precursor with low proliferative activity. similarly, in the pdx <dig> morphant, proliferating beta cells or mitotic progenitors contribute only a minor fraction to the beta cells emerging after  <dig> hpf.

these studies indicate that, during normal development, the cell type that gives rise to late endocrine cells represents a subtype of ventral bud cells that is already set aside at  <dig> hpf, and that slowly divides in contrast to the rapidly dividing cells that form the exocrine pancreas. previous analysis showed that the ventral pancreatic bud contains ptf1a-expressing cells that form the exocrine pancreas and a distinct population that responds to notch and gives rise to endocrine and duct cells  <cit> . our data indicates that within the non-exocrine cells, there is a population of non-proliferative cells that comprises latent endocrine progenitors.

function of pdx <dig> in late endocrine cells
a major finding of this work is the requirement for pdx <dig> in specification of all late forming endocrine cells. expression of pdx <dig> is very dynamic in the developing pancreas and genetic analyses using conditional and hypomorphic pdx <dig> mutant alleles in mouse have already indicated that pdx <dig> is important in various specification and differentiation events  <cit> . in zebrafish, fate-mapping studies indicated that a spatial separation of the future pancreatic db versus vb progenitors is already established shortly after gastrulation   <cit> . medium levels of pdx <dig> expression during early somitogenesis  correlate with vb fate specification  <cit> . thus, already these early differences in pdx <dig> expression could provide permissive or instructive cues for the specification of latent progenitors that later give rise to second wave endocrine cells.

the developing extrapancreatic duct and the proximal pancreas express high levels of pdx <dig> from  <dig> hpf . in pdx <dig> morpholino-treated embryos, pdx <dig> is diminished at least until  <dig> dpf, but overall formation of the extrapancreatic duct is not affected. an absence of duct-associated progenitors for second wave endocrine cells could result from duct cells being committed to a non-endocrine fate due to an early deficiency in pdx <dig>  alternatively, deficient pdx <dig> in duct cells might impede the generation of endocrine precursors from a latent progenitor. several lines of research suggests that pancreatic ductal epithelium is heterogeneous and contains a limited numbers of cells that have the potential for endocrine differentiation  <cit> . we have here defined a strategy that eliminates endocrine cell formation without affecting duct morphology, which will be useful to help further characterize the latent progenitor cell type.

morphogenesis of late endocrine cells
our transgenic and timelapse analyses provide new insights into the behavior of late-arising endocrine cells. neurod:egfp-positive cells associated with the extrapancreatic duct defined by 2f <dig> antibody staining exhibited protrusions characteristic of delaminating cells. we developed a method for maintaining embryo viability after yolk removal, which allowed for the first time a clear visualization of developing late endocrine cells in living embryos. we delineated pancreatic progenitors in the context of the pancreatic duct and digestive system, and recorded migration of neurod:egfp positive endocrine progenitors as they emerged from the duct and moved to the principal islet. this method provides the basis for future analysis of molecular regulators of these complex morphogenetic events during pancreatic islet development.

CONCLUSIONS
these studies establish that pdx <dig> is essential for generating an endocrine cell progenitor population associated with the pancreatic duct in zebrafish. we show that formation of latent progenitors in the extrapancreatic and intrapancreatic duct requires pdx <dig>  and provide evidence that they are slowly dividing cells, and are thus distinct from rapidly proliferating cells that form the exocrine tissue. further, these latent progenitors differentiate in response to notch inhibition. our findings open up new approaches for examination of the specification and behavior of endocrine progenitors during zebrafish embryogenesis, in which these processes can now be visualized, and where large-scale chemical and pharmacologic screening can be applied. this can in turn provide clues as to how developmental programs can be harnessed and reactivated to generate replacement beta cells for more efficient treatment of diabetes.
