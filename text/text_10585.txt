BACKGROUND
in birds and mammals, pigmentation of the feather and fur is determined mainly by the distribution of two melanin pigments, eumelanin  and phaeomelanin . the synthesis of both pigments depends on tyrosinase, the key enzyme in melanin biogenesis in pigment cells, which catalyzes tyrosine in the first two biochemical steps resulting in the production of dihydroxyphenylalanine  and dopaquinone  <cit> . tyrosinase also catalyses the subsequent step in the formation of eumelanin  <cit>  with the dehydrogenation of  <dig> -dihydroxyindole-2-carbonic acid . without a proper enzymatic function of tyrosinase, the melanin synthesis pathway is blocked or incomplete; the animals exhibit an albino phenotype. in humans and mice, the c locus has been genetically defined as the structural tyrosinase gene. in chickens, three mutant alleles have been reported at the c locus in addition to the wild type allele , which is the most dominant allele with full pigmentation. these mutations are the red-eye white , the recessive white  and the autosomal albino   <cit> . they all give a white plumage but differ by pigmentation of the eye varying from a grey color to a totally non-pigmented albino phenotype  <cit>  . furthermore, day-old chicks may exhibit a lightly pigmented down at hatch in homozygous carriers of the c*c mutation. as reported previously  <cit> , the recessive white  is one of the earliest traits to be studied in chicken genetics, applying mendel's rules to segregating families for feather color patterns. the recessive white phenotype is a varietal characteristic of many breeds, such as the plymouth rock, wyandotte, minorca, orpington, jersey giant, dorking, langshan, and silky  <cit> .

the chicken tyrosinase gene has been cloned  <cit>  and its polymorphism has been characterized in the albino chicken  by tobita-teramoto et al.  who reported a six nucleotide deletion in the tyrosinase coding sequence of the albino chicken  <cit> . so far, the molecular structure of the tyrosinase gene has not been studied for the two other alleles c*re and c*c. in this study, we performed a molecular analysis of the tyrosinase gene in recessive white chickens in order to investigate the gene polymorphism and localize the causal mutation. we identified an avian retroviral sequence insertion in the tyrosinase gene of recessive white chickens in complete association with the mutant phenotype. moreover, we established a rapid, sensitive and accurate diagnostic genotyping test that would be very helpful for breeders to identify heterozygous carriers of this recessive mutation.

RESULTS
rflp analysis
four probes  containing total or partial chicken tyrosinase cdna, based on the sequence of white leghorn chicken tyrosinase cdna  <cit> , were used. we observed a restriction fragment length polymorphism  with  <dig> different enzymes  in all recessive white mutant chickens using a total chicken tyrosinase cdna probe. these results strongly suggest a major rearrangement in the structure of the tyr gene of the recessive white mutant . in order to more accurately localize this rearrangement, we used partial probes containing different coding regions of the chicken tyrosinase cdna. noticeably, probe tyrc which contained exon  <dig>  revealed the same diagnostic bands between normal and mutant chickens as did the full cdna probe. this result showed that the structural difference of the tyr gene between the recessive white mutant and the wild type chicken was located in the 3' terminal region of the tyr cdna .

pcr and dna sequencing analysis
pcr amplification was performed for each of the five inferred exons of the chicken tyr gene . all five exons were amplified from genomic dna of recessive white chickens as well as wild type chickens. the results showed no size difference of amplified fragments between recessive white and wild type animals. direct sequencing in both directions was performed to further investigate a possible sequence difference between carriers of the white mutation and colored chickens. the sequencing results of the five exons show that exon sequences were 100% identical for both genotypes. this result established that the rearrangement region of the tyr gene in the recessive white chicken was not in the coding sequence.

long-range pcr and intronic dna sequencing
once we had confirmed that the structural difference of the tyr gene in the recessive white chicken was near the 3' terminal region of the tyr cdna and not in the exon sequence, a long-range pcr  procedure was performed in order to amplify intron  <dig> of the chicken tyr gene in both recessive white and colored chickens. a major size difference of  <dig>  kb was observed in intron  <dig> between the recessive white mutant   and the normal genotype  . further sequencing of the total intron region of a homozygous recessive white chicken revealed the presence of a  <dig>  kb full-length retrovirus. this insertion was found in inverted orientation within intron  <dig> of the tyr gene and showed 99%  identity with the sequence of the avian leucosis endogenous virus ev- <dig>   <cit>  after using the blastn program  <cit> . the comparative analysis of the intron  <dig> sequence between the two genotypes  and the published sequence for the red jungle fowl  <cit>  revealed three major sequence changes between the recessive white chicken and the red jungle fowl and two major sequence changes between the colored inra chicken and the red jungle fowl . in addition to the retroviral insertion, intron  <dig> from the recessive white chicken exhibited a polya stretch in position  <dig> â€“  <dig>  which was not found in the colored chicken but was found in the red jungle fowl which has a colored plumage also. therefore, the insertion of the retroviral sequence in the tyr intron  <dig> sequence was the single critical change found in the recessive white chicken as compared to the colored chicken and the red jungle fowl.

a comparison of sequence analysis with the chicken genome sequence  <cit>  also provides a clear explanation for the previous rflp results. the inserted avian retroviral sequence has added hindiii and bamhi restriction sites upstream of exon  <dig> of the chicken tyr gene, which results in a  <dig>  kb hindiii band and a  <dig>  kb bamhi-hindiii band after a hindiii single digestion or a bamhi-hindiii double digestion and hybridization with an exon  <dig> probe .

diagnostic genotyping test
we designed three primers to establish a pcr diagnostic test after analyzing the intron  <dig> sequence of the colored and recessive white chicken . the homozygous colored chicken and homozygous recessive white chicken showed a single band of the expected size, either  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp respectively, while the heterozygous chicken showed both  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp bands after electrophoresis in agarose gel .

a total of  <dig> samples were tested from our experimental line  and from french slow-growing commercial lines ; they included  <dig> chickens showing the recessive white phenotype, and  <dig> colored chickens . according to the diagnostic test, all the  <dig> recessive white chickens from various origins were homozygous carriers of the retroviral sequence insertion and no colored chicken was found to be homozygous for the insertion. a total of  <dig> heterozygous carriers and  <dig> homozygous normal were found among colored chickens, which was consistent with the segregation of the recessive white mutation in the lines studied. the results obtained in the nine inra sire families also confirmed that the retroviral sequence inserted in the c locus is stable and heritable in a mendelian way; all the genotypes observed in the progeny were consistent with the parental genotypes.

thus, the accuracy of the diagnostic test achieved 100% on  <dig> white recessive chickens from six different populations in france. this test is rapid, sensitive, and specific to distinguish the c*n/c*n homozygous, c*c/c*c homozygous and c*n/c*c heterozygous birds.

the last data set included  <dig> samples from  <dig> unrelated breeds and showed that the mutation was rare but could be found at various frequencies in a few populations that were exhibiting a white plumage phenotype . the animals of the white silky breed were homozygous c*c/c*c, which shows that this mutation did not prevent skin pigmentation. the mutation was not found in any of the population showing only colored animals. however, the recessive white mutation was not found in some white birds, which originated from breeds  that are expected to carry the dominant white mutation. regarding the broilers, the history of these lines mentions the presence of the dominant white in the cornish breed, an ancestor of broiler lines, as well as the presence of the recessive white in the plymouth rock and new hampshire breeds, which were also used as ancestors of broiler lines. thus, it is likely that current broilers may carry one or both of these mutations.

5' and 3' rapid amplification of the cdna end  of the tyr gene and sequence analysis
the 5' and 3' end of the tyr gene cdna were obtained by race  from skin samples of  <dig> week old chickens, either colored and heterozygous carrier of the mutation, or homozygous for the recessive white allele. isolated 5' and 3' end fragments, were first aligned with the exon sequences to complete the total mrna transcript sequence. the complete transcript sequences were compared to the published chicken tyr cdna sequences  <cit>  and to the published red jungle fowl sequence  <cit>  by blast  <cit> . the 3' race result revealed that, in the skin of recessive white chickens, the 3'utr was shorter than in colored chickens . these short transcripts did not contain exon  <dig>  they exhibited a normal sequence from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> and retained a short 5' flanking sequence from intron  <dig>  before terminating with a polya tail . there putative polyadenylation signals were found in the intron  <dig> sequence. by using different polyadenylation signals, the aberrant transcripts found in recessive white chickens may be classified in three types, of a different length, the consensus sequence of each type is shown on figure  <dig>  there was no sequence difference in the 5' end of the tyr gene mrna amplified from skin samples of both colored and recessive white chickens.

tyr gene expression tested by rt-pcr
a set of six birds  was tested by rt-pcr. rt-pcr results confirmed that the major transcript in the recessive white chicken is a truncated transcript but a very low level of expression of the normal transcript was detected . in contrast, there was only a normal-sized transcript in homozygote colored chickens. for the heterozygous colored chicken, the amount of the normal transcript was apparently higher than that of the aberrant transcript.

discussion
we report for the first time in chickens, as well as in vertebrates, a mutation of the tyrosinase gene that involves intron  <dig> and does not affect the coding sequence of any of the  <dig> exons. indeed, the albino alleles described at the tyr locus are usually due to a single nucleotide substitution or a single nucleotide insertion/deletion in the coding sequence  <cit> , but not in the intronic sequence. as an example, the dark-eyed albino mutation in the mouse  <cit>  presents a high phenotypic similarity with the recessive white chicken because it exhibits a white coat color, with pigmented eyes. this mutation was found to be due to a single base point mutation in exon  <dig> of the mouse tyrosinase gene, but no information was provided regarding the intron sequences. another case of a white-coat animal with pigmented eyes was described in rabbits  <cit> , and could not be associated to any mutation in the coding sequence. furthermore, a screening of  <dig> cases of human oculocutaneous albinism  revealed the absence of any mutation in the coding sequence of the tyrosinase gene for  <dig> cases  <cit> ,  <dig> of these  <dig> were found in probands with the oca1b condition, where minimal-to-moderate amounts of cutaneous and ocular pigment could be found. our results show that it may not be possible to elucidate the mechanism of a tyrosinase mutation in some phenotypes showing white hairs or white coat and eye pigmentation, unless intron structure, and, if possible, intron sequence, are studied.

the retroviral insertion found in intron  <dig> of the tyrosinase gene may modify the gene's transcription pattern. indeed, the 3'utr results revealed that aberrant transcripts were generated in the recessive white chicken by alternative splicing and using three alternate polyadenylation sites that are present in the normal intron  <dig> sequence . it is most likely that the retroviral insertion plays a very important role in the splicing procedure and causes aberrant mrna.

tyrosinase exon  <dig> is the carboxyl terminal membrane spanning domain  <cit>  which has an important role for the proper positioning of the enzyme in the melanosome  <cit> . a defect in the trafficking of the tyrosinase protein may affect the biogenesis of melanosomes  <cit>  but melanosomal transfer to the keratinocytes is not well characterised. disruption of this process would be expected to have severe consequences for pigmentation  <cit> . misrouting of tyrosinase was observed in the platinum allele at the mouse albino locus, which is characterized by the occurrence of an abnormal stop codon in position  <dig> within exon  <dig> of the tyr gene  <cit> . this mutation is responsible for an extremely diluted coat color and pink eyes. in a human case, a single base insertion located in the transmembrane domain of the tyrosinase gene eliminated a portion of the transmembrane region and the carboxy terminus, and resulted in an inactive enzyme causing tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism  <cit> . in the case of the chicken recessive white mutation, the lack of exon  <dig> in the transcript could affect the translation of the membrane spanning domain although the conserved copper-binding regions are retained; this transcript may therefore encode a cytoplasmic, rather than a membrane-bound enzyme, and this would disturb melanogenesis. although the truncated transcripts do not have a stop codon before the polyadenylation, they are still the major transcripts in the recessive white chicken. previous studies of tyrosinase in the mouse suggested that shorter cdna resulting from alternative splicing may have non functional tyrosinase activity  <cit> . translation of the recessive white chicken alternative transcripts would be expected to result in a truncated protein. a previous study of the tyrosinase enzyme suggested that both c*c  and c*a  alleles could produce tyrosinase-like molecules that are inactive due to a change that is electrophoretically and antigenically "silent"  <cit> .

the difference observed between the eye and the feather pigmentation will need further consideration. the retinal pigment epithelium  derives from the optic cup  <cit>  and arises from different precursor cells than the skin melanocytes. furthermore, the eye pigment cells do not transfer their pigment  <cit> . thus, the consequences of a defect in pigment synthesis may be expected to differ in the eye and in the feathers. for instance, the dominant white mutation of the chicken has been found to be a defect of the pmel <dig> gene  <cit>  which codes for a membrane protein of the melanosome, this mutation suppresses black pigment from the feathers but does not affect eye pigmentation. the fact that some pigment appears in the eyes of recessive white chickens indicates some tyrosinase activity. in the case of the mouse dark-eyed albino mutation , the tyr gene expression was not affected by the point mutation, but the phenotypic consequences of this mutation were less severe in the eyes than in the coat. if a partially truncated tyrosinase protein is produced in the recessive white chicken, this may cause disorganization of pigment into melanosomes and may lead to an improper transfer to the feather keratinocyte, but it might not affect skin pigmentation, and could explain why the white silky exhibits black skin with white plumage in the presence of a mutated tyrosinase gene. an alternative interpretation of the mechanism of the recessive white mutation is that the aberrant transcript does not give any functional protein at all, but that pigmentation is maintained in some tissues since a small proportion of the normal transcript is still produced in the mutant . maybe this is a sufficient amount in some tissues  but not in the growing feather. the splicing may also be different according to tissues.

retroviral insertions are known to be responsible for insertional mutagenesis in mice, as illustrated by the 'dilute' coat color mutation  <cit>  and the hairless mutation  <cit> . in chickens, the henny-feathering mutation  results from an abnormal expression pattern of the aromatase gene, under the control of a retroviral long terminal repeat  <cit> . the sex-linked late-feathering mutation, k, is associated with the insertion of a full-size retroviral sequence, named alve <dig>  together with the duplication of the insertion site  <cit> . both hf and k are dominant mutations. the k mutation exhibits some peculiar features due to its association with alve21:  revertants have been observed which carry a solitary long terminal repeat  in place of the full retroviral element  <cit> ,  carriers of the k mutation exhibited a higher susceptibility to exogenous leucosis infection in some chicken strains such as white leghorns, this phenomenon could be partly explained by the production of a full viral particle due to the expression of the alve <dig> genome. no such observation has been made for the recessive white mutation, which could suggest that the insertion found within intron  <dig> is quite stable and that the retroviral genome is not expressed or not sufficient to induce an interaction with exogenous retroviruses. since the recessive white mutation has never been described as unstable, it may be questioned whether the insertion in inverted orientation may limit the occurrence of reversion events. revertants could have been detected in our diagnostic test if only a solitary ltr was remaining at the site of insertion, then a larger band would have been amplified between the diag05-nor-up and diagnostic05-dw primers in some colored chickens, but this was not observed.

CONCLUSIONS
the structural change  initially identified in the tyr gene of recessive white chickens has been shown to result from the insertion of a complete avian retroviral sequence of  <dig>  kb in intron  <dig> of the gene. the development of a rapid pcr diagnostic test made it possible to study the distribution of this insertion among various chicken populations, which showed that homozygous carriers were always found to have a white plumage, whatever the origin of the line. the finding of the same insertion in populations sharing the recessive white phenotype but as distantly related as a french experimental line derived from the gÃ¢tinaise breed, a commercial slow-growing broiler line, and the asiatic silky breed, strongly supports that this retroviral insertion is not a spurious association with the recessive white mutation and could be the causal mutation. indeed, truncated transcripts lacking exon  <dig> were identified in the skin of recessive white chickens, but were not found in the skin of colored chickens, homozygous for the normal allele. this represents a new model for the investigation of the effects of an intronic mutation in the tyr gene on the phenotype-genotype relationship, since all the mutations previously described for this gene across species affected the coding sequence.

finally, a rapid diagnostic genotyping test is now available to breeders, in order to identify heterozygous carriers of the mutation, which could be otherwise identified only by a tedious progeny-test.
