BACKGROUND
trait anxiety is characteristic of personalities associated with a tendency to experience anxiety. excessive trait anxiety is a risk factor for anxiety disorder and other psychosomatic diseases  <cit> . many behavioral studies have demonstrated that negative emotional stimuli interfere with attention performance in anxious individuals  <cit> . the color-word emotional stroop task is an effective experimental method of assessing interference between emotion and attention  <cit> . a number of studies have shown that anxious individuals respond more slowly to negative words than do healthy controls, suggesting that anxious individuals tend to allocate their attention selectively toward negative-related information  <cit> . this attentional bias may play an important role in the onset and maintenance of anxiety disorders. however, an effective way to control or improve this emotion-related attentional bias in high trait anxiety  individuals is still undetermined.

electroencephalogram  biofeedback refers to an operant conditioning paradigm that participants learn in order to alter their brain activity by regulating specific parameters of the eeg; this process is intended to improve neurological and psychiatric symptoms. several studies have demonstrated the clinical value of eeg biofeedback in treating psychological disorders such as anxiety  <cit> , epilepsy  <cit>  and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  <cit> , as well as optimising the psychoemotional status and cognitive performance of healthy subjects  <cit> . predominant alpha  amplitude occurs in a relaxed and eye-closed state, moreover, it is related to the idling of the brain while remaining ready for engagement  <cit> . the decrease in alpha amplitude observed in opened eyes indicates an increase in activation, whereas the increase in alpha amplitude in closed eyes indicates less activation  <cit> . amplitude of the alpha band reflects an inhibition of irrelevant information which in turn may facilitate performance on the task  <cit> . eye-closed neurofeedback training aimed at increasing alpha amplitude/power may lead to selective inhibition of irrelevant attentional activity and an improvement of neural efficiency  <cit> . an increase in alpha power is the most commonly used indicator of relaxation as a means to reduce anxiety  <cit>  and enhance short term memory performance  <cit> . however, the effectiveness of eeg biofeedback using alpha training directed toward the attentional bias in anxious individuals remains unknown.

the assessment of attention performance and eeg activity using alpha training may be of great value in providing an empirical rationale for clinical application of eeg biofeedback to specific symptoms. egner and gruzelier  <cit>  showed that eeg biofeedback training led to significant changes in attention performance and event-related potentials  in healthy volunteers. beta protocol learning was positively correlated with increased target p <dig> erps in an auditory oddball task. p <dig> erps are thought to reflect the attentional and mental state in task execution process of information collection and classification   <cit> . recent finding indicated that the p <dig> in the target condition was modulated by the changes of alpha event-related desynchronization, involving attention allocation  <cit> . furthermore, alpha band activity is strongly related to p <dig>  which suggests that the p <dig> is related to attention and memory processing. the p <dig> may result from the operation of neural inhibition generated when cognitive mechanisms are engaged by stimulus and task demands  <cit> , but the relation between p <dig> and attentional bias in hta individuals is still unclear. it is also unknown whether changes in alpha activity and associated p <dig> of hta individuals may in some way mediate their attentional bias.

to investigate the efficacy and mechanisms of eeg biofeedback training on attentional bias of hta individuals to negative stimuli, the present study will apply eeg biofeedback using alpha training to hta individuals and examine its effect on attentional bias associated with brain activity. in addition, we assessed the specific change of p <dig> latency during the emotional stroop task after eeg biofeedback.

methods
participants were recruited from a pool of  <dig> undergraduates at sun yat-sen university, who were administered with the chinese version of the state-trait anxiety inventory . according to the tai’s score, participants were classified into the hta group with 20% of the highest scores  and the nonanxious  group with 20% of the lowest scores . all participants were right-handed as determined by the annett handedness inventory . they were all native chinese speakers with self-reported normal color vision. participants were informed of the procedures of the study and gave written informed consent. they declared no previous personal history of neurological and psychiatric disorder or of familial psychiatric disorder. this study was approved by the ethics committee of the sun yat-sen university.

emotional stroop task 
word presentation and response recording were controlled by e-prime software . the experimental materials consisted of positive, negative and neutral words presented in different colors . there were  <dig> trials for each color  and valence  category; thus there were  <dig> trials in total. the emotional and neutral words were selected from the chinese affective word system  <cit> . each condition comprised  <dig> words; three word types were matched for arousal, word frequency and complexity of the characters. the size of the chinese words was song ti no. <dig>  each trial consisted of one word presented in the center of a 19-inch screen on a black background in a pseudo-random order.

participants were seated in a dark room facing a monitor placed  <dig> cm from their eyes. they were instructed to rest their fingers on the “f”, “j” and space buttons on the keyboard; each of the three buttons was respectively designated to indicate red, green or blue color. these stimulus–response key assignments were counterbalanced across individuals. all participants were told that a white cross would appear in the center of the screen serving as a fixation point, followed by one word written in color. the fixation point lasted for 300– <dig> ms and then each word for  <dig> ms. participants were asked to ignore the meaning of the words and identify the color as quickly as possible by pressing the designated button of the corresponding color. the experiment was divided into a practice phase and a test phase. the practice phase was designed to rehearse the mapping of colors onto fingers and pressing of the response buttons. when the accuracy rate for each individual reached 85%, the practice phase was ended. the formal test phase consisted of three blocks. each block had  <dig> judgment trials presented in individually varied, randomized sequences. participants were instructed to try their best to avoid blinking or any eye movement and keep their eyes fixated on the monitor rather than look down at their fingers during trial phases. after each block, there was a period of brief rest.

erp recording and analysis
eeg data were recorded from  <dig> scalp sites with an erp workstation  using tin electrodes mounted in an elastic cap during the est. electrodes were referenced to linked earlobes  and the ground electrode was placed  <dig>  cm anterior to the central frontal  electrode. impedance was kept below  <dig> kΩ. data were digitized at a sampling rate of 500 hz and passed through a  <dig> - <dig> hz bandpass filter. recording, digitization and subsequent off-line data processing were carried out with brain vision system .

corrected data were divided into periods of 900 ms, starting with  <dig> ms prior to the stimulus onset. epochs were baseline corrected with the  <dig> ms pre-stimulus interval, and any epochs containing eeg fluctuation exceeding ± <dig> μv were rejected as artifact contamination. only trials of correct responses were used in the analysis. a minimum of  <dig> trials was available for each condition. on the basis of the erps grand averaged waveforms and a topographic map, the following nine electrode sites were chosen for statistical analysis: c <dig>  cz, c <dig>  p <dig>  pz, p <dig>  o <dig>  oz and o <dig>  the p <dig> wave was defined as the highest positive deflection at the central, parietal and occipital electrodes within a post-stimulus time interval of 250– <dig> ms for attended target stimuli.

experiment 1
the between-subject independent variable was the group , within-subject independent variable was the word type . the dependent variable was the reaction time or p <dig> latency in naming the color words in the est. we quantified attentional bias as reaction time in naming the color words during the est. the working hypothesis was that if there were any attentional bias induced by the emotional words as a cue, the reaction time would be increased or decreased. the erp waves from the three word types were overlapped and averaged separately, and then p <dig> latencies were compared between the hta and na groups.

experiment 2
the hta individuals in experiment  <dig> were randomly divided into two groups, eeg biofeedback  group  for 8– <dig> hz alpha training, and sham biofeedback  group , without eeg feedback. both groups received the same duration and frequency of the protocols for twice a week and a total of  <dig> times. the two groups completed the s-tai measurement and the est during erp recording after the intervention. pre- and post- training erp recordings were carried out at approximately the same time of day for the hta individuals and inter-test intervals exceeded  <dig> weeks. a group ×word type ×time  mixed-design analysis of variance  was applied, followed by post hoc comparisons assessing within-group changes for each group , and between-group differences .

eeg biofeedback
eeg biofeedback training was conducted with a spirit nexus-16b  and its software . a signal was acquired at 160 hz, a/d converted and band-filtered to beta , alpha  and theta  components. according to the international 10– <dig> system, the active scalp electrode was placed at c <dig> or c <dig> for alpha training with a reference electrode placed ipsilaterally and a ground electrode placed on the contralateral earlobe. impedance was kept below  <dig> kΩ. a 3-5min eye-closed baseline was first recorded during pre-feedback to set initial alpha band thresholds. subsequently, eye-closed auditory feedback was engaged for  <dig> min continuously. alpha activity was represented by an ‘ocean waves’ background sound and over-threshold alpha activity by a ‘warble’ sound; the latter was set to have a higher priority over the former. over-threshold alpha-related sounds acted as a reward and were intended for relaxation. the more alpha activity exceeded threshold, the greater the feedback sound. the reward band threshold was set within a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  times its baseline average. this range ensured that the participants would not be rewarded for simply tensing cranial muscles. artifact rejection thresholds were set for each individual and auditory feedback signals were not heard within  <dig> seconds of eye movements or other motor activity, as they would have caused gross eeg fluctuations.

the working principles of the feedback loop were explained to the participants in the eeg bf group. subjects wore a set of headphones and rested in a comfortable reclining chair. they were instructed to relax deeply to achieve an increase in the amount of alpha band activity resulting from sound representation, but to prevent the subject from falling asleep. eeg inhibition of delta band  activity was also implemented to preclude the latter. the sham-bf participants were provided with only the ‘ocean waves’ background sound during the whole training. all subjects participated in twice-weekly training sessions over the course of  <dig> weeks.

the accuracy rates for naming the color words were above 90% in both groups. reaction time  for negative, positive and neutral word trials was analyzed for correct trial responses between  <dig> and 1200 ms. a word type ×group  repeated measure anova was conducted. rts were the dependent variable. greenhouse–geisser corrections were inspected. there was a significant main effect of word type on rts = <dig> , p= <dig> ). the interaction between word type and group was significant = <dig> , p= <dig> ), indicating that the group difference of attentional effect was dependent on emotional stimuli. simple-effect tests revealed that rts toward negative words were longer in the hta group compared to the na group = <dig> , p= <dig> ). moreover, rts for negative words were longer than for neutral words in the hta group = <dig> , p= <dig> ) , but there was no significant effect in the na group.

experiment 2
eeg biofeedback data
there were no statistically significant differences between eeg bf and sham-bf groups for gender, age, tai’s score,rt,p <dig> amplitude and latency in the est . after all of the training sessions, tai’s scores were significantly decreased by  <dig> ± <dig>  in the eeg bf group = <dig> , p= <dig> ) while the sham-bf group rendered a decrease, though not significant, of  <dig> ± <dig> . furthermore, tai's scores were significantly lower in the eeg bf group than in the sham-bf group after the intervention =− <dig> , p= <dig> ). the results of the intervention on the est are shown in figure  <dig>  a word type ×group ×time  mixed-design anova revealed a significant time main effect for rts = <dig> , p= <dig> ). the interaction between word type and group was significant = <dig> , p= <dig> ). the analysis of the alpha amplitudes' baseline value indicated that alpha amplitudes were significant enhanced post-training compared to pre-training in the eeg bf group= <dig> , p= <dig> ), while no significant changes were found in the sham-bf group.

the anova analysis for p <dig> amplitudes in the pre- and post-intervention revealed no significant differences within the eeg bf and sham-bf groups .

the mixed-design anova for p <dig> latencies in the est disclosed a significant word type×time×group interaction effect = <dig> , p= <dig> ). simple-effect tests found that p <dig> latencies evoked by negative words were shortened after the intervention in the eeg bf group = <dig> ,p= <dig> ), whereas there were no differences in p <dig> latencies toward positive and neutral words between pre- and post-training. the word type×electrode site×group interaction effect was significant = <dig> , p= <dig> ). at the single electrode level, the eeg bf group displayed a significant reduction in the p <dig> latencies at pz = <dig> , p= <dig> ) and oz = <dig> , p= <dig> ). no significant changes were detected in the sham-bf group .

discussion
consistent with previous studies  <cit> , we found that attention performance can be modified by negative words in hta individuals in the emotional stroop task. singhal et al. found that the p <dig> amplitude was larger for emotional pictures  than for neutral pictures in anxious adolescents during the emotional oddball paradigm  <cit> . the current study showed that the p <dig> latency induced by negative words was longer in the hta group than in the na group. this p <dig> delay can be interpreted as reflecting the sustained negative-related emotion processing in hta individuals.

this study examined the efficacy of eeg bf on attentional bias in hta. anxious individuals were trained to increase alpha amplitudes. the improvement of attentional bias was confirmed, as the rt toward negative words of the est was significantly less in the eeg bf group than in the sham-bf group. a significant reduction in the tai’s scores was also observed after the eeg bf group was given alpha training. the present study demonstrated that the improvement in anxiety observed in the eeg bf group were not merely due to general relaxation training, as these benefits were not observed in the sham-bf group. the sham-bf group experienced the same relaxation strategy as the eeg bf group but was provided with a non-feedback reward. recent research has shown promising results in anxious children and adults by using attentional bias modification training  <cit> . to explore the optimising procedure, future studies are expected to compare different interventions on attentional bias.

the present findings support alpha amplitude as a promising eeg bf parameter that is worth exploring and investigating further. alpha may reflect the resonance frequency of such a feedback loop for the state of an optimal cognitive performance. most individuals reported evoking relaxation as the best strategy to increase alpha. recent studies indicated that long-range upper alpha band synchrony is well suited to serve attention in cognitive function  <cit> . these findings could also explain varieties of training successes across studies. personality factors, the alpha distribution or the impact of cognition could be individual factors predicting or influencing the success of eeg bf. the different findings in current and prior studies using eeg bf could arise from the many differences among these studies, including differences in methodology  and/or sample characteristics   <cit> . alpha training alone cannot fully explain the effects of eeg biofeedback. therefore, using different frequency bands for training would be desirable for future studies.

this study provides some evidence of the intervention effect of eeg biofeedback. moreover, the study also generates some insights into the mechanism by which eeg biofeedback improves attentional bias toward negative stimuli. the present study suggests that improved control of attention on negative stimuli contributes to the observed emotional benefits of hta as a direct effect of eeg biofeedback, which is possibly achieved through the effects on the reduction of p <dig> latency. in addition, p <dig> latencies of the eeg bf group were significantly shorter post-training than pre-training, which was not observed in the sham-bf group, supporting a relationship between p <dig> latency and attention performance. previous studies demonstrated that p <dig> evoked by target stimuli was generated mainly at the posterior cingulate cortex and could reflect the high cognitive activation and attention  <cit> . although the statistical analysis did not show a main effect of eeg biofeedback on the p <dig> latency in the est, alpha training led to the reduction of p <dig> latency to negative stimuli at parietal and occipital lobes in hta individuals. the modulation process may be involved in cognitive information communication among these activated regions from alpha sources  to p <dig> generators . this finding indicates that alpha activity appears earlier than p <dig> for attention processing. further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of eeg biofeedback on these effects.

a small sample size in this study might limit the generalization of practical application and necessitates replication of these findings. negative stimuli rather than threat stimuli were employed for hta individuals, which could attenuate outcomes and limit generalisability to other affective stimuli. while alpha training is somewhat akin to smr or beta training paradigms, the use of other training paradigms may raise questions whether these findings could be explained by an artifact related to specific differences between different frequency band training. while these questions cannot be resolved by the present data, it should be noted that there are no strong theoretical grounds for predicting that specific differences in different paradigms would explain the observed reduction in clinical anxiety or the increased attention bias to negative stimuli. further studies with larger sample sizes are required to clarify these alternative explanations.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that the p <dig> latency was prolonged to negative words in hta individuals, which is associated with attentional bias. eeg biofeedback can improve the anxious state and negative emotional attentional bias in hta individuals. the mechanism of eeg biofeedback intervention may be related to the normalization of p <dig> latency. our findings have shown the effectiveness of eeg biofeedback training on the high trait anxiety group.
