BACKGROUND
non-coding rna transcripts have emerged as an important type of regulatory molecules  <cit> , in particular, natural antisense transcripts  that can bind by partial complementarity to sense rna transcripts to modulate their processing  <cit> . their generation and mechanism of action are different to those of mirnas, which are processed into shorter  <dig> nt products and have possibly less specific effects  <cit> .

complementarity to target transcript, which is a requirement for a nat to have an effect, is evident if the nat is expressed in cis to the sense transcript , but this ties the evolution of both the sense transcript target and its cis-nat  <cit> .

trans-nats, on the other hand, are transcribed from a sequence that it is not located in the same genomic locus of their target and can then evolve separately constrained only by keeping a complementary region to the target gene  <cit> . against accumulating evidence about trans-nats, the puzzle remains of how relatively large and specific complementary regions can arise to form such anti-sense transcripts. a possibility that we raise here is that given a parental gene regulated by a cis-nat, the duplication of the genomic fragment including the cis-nat may result in a pseudogene holding an active copy of the cis-nat, which is naturally a trans-nat of the parental gene. then, evolution can eliminate any of the nats or tune their expression differently. more generally, the formation of any pseudogene results in complementary regions to the parental gene which, if combined with elements of transcriptional control antisense to the pseudogene, can conceivably lead to the generation of a trans-nat antisense the pseudogene that is a potential regulator of the parental gene.

antisense transcription from pseudogenes in mammals was discovered in human  <cit>  and mouse  <cit> , but with unknown function. although it has been estimated that up to 20% of human pseudogenes can originate transcripts  <cit>  there is little evidence of such transcripts having an effect in the expression of the parental genes or any other functionality for that matter  <cit> . possibly, the best characterized example is the neuronal nitric oxide synthase gene  in the central nervous system of the snail lymnaea stagnalis. in this case, the nnos pseudogene is itself a trans-nat that inhibits the expression of nnos  <cit> , and this trans-nat is expressed in a conditioning-dependent manner indicating a role in learning and long-term memory  <cit> . other less-direct evidence of transcription from pseudogenes with an effect on the expression of their parental genes was given by the finding of pseudogenes that are the source of dsrnas regulating gene expression in mouse oocytes  <cit> . expression of possible sirnas from pseudogenes has also been studied in rice  <cit> .

an explanation for this small number of cases could be that the evolution of a functional trans-nat from the antisense strand of a pseudogene eventually erases the traces of the pseudogene; therefore, the possibility of observing a trans-nat related to a pseudogene could be transitory in evolutionary terms. for this reason, an exhaustive study of the database of transcripts to find and analyze the expression and sequence of antisense transcripts from pseudogenes is necessary to show evidence of these mechanisms.

we identified pseudogenes with transcription from their antisense strand; by definition, these are complementary to the parental gene of the pseudogene and can be defined as trans-nats of that parental gene. then, we studied the alignment between the dna sequence the trans-nat is transcribed from and the parental gene. in particular, we obtained the distribution of the mutations that appeared in the trans-nat after the pseudogene formation. we observed distinctly a higher similarity between the sequences in a  <dig> nt region nearby the 3' end of the antisense transcript. this shows an increased selection pressure to keep the similarity between the pseudogene and the parental gene in the region that corresponds to the end of the trans-nat and suggests a functional association between the trans-nats and the parental gene.

RESULTS
we found  <dig> transcripts expressed antisense of human pseudogenes by analysis of the expressed sequence tag  database . these transcripts are complementary to the parental gene and are by definition trans-nats. the ests used as evidence were selected to align significantly better to the pseudogene than to any other genomic location. the direction of their transcription was verified using as evidence the strongest poly-adenylation signals  found within  <dig> nt of their 3'-end  <cit> , splicing signals and cdna-end poly-a tracts.

we then aligned the trans-nat to its homologous region in the antisense strand of the parental gene . the goal is to study the position of the mutations that appeared in the trans-nat region after the pseudogene formation. in most cases  the alignment on the parental gene included the region that surrounds the pas of the trans-nat. in  <dig> cases we found ests in the parental gene region that suggested the expression of a cis-nat equivalent to the observed trans-nat.

to study the patterns of evolution of the  <dig> trans-nats that fully aligned to the parental gene, we generated a histogram that describes the sequence identity between the pseudogene region originating the trans-nat and the parental gene . neutral evolution would be indicated by a flat distribution of identity, whereas variations from this distribution should show selection pressure for some sequence features that would point to functionality  <cit> . most of the contribution to this observation is due to a lower occurrence of indels .

the plot shows a region of higher identity extending about  <dig> nt upstream the pas of the trans-nats expressed antisense to pseudogenes. this implies that a lower than expected level of mutations appeared in a region nearby the 3' end of the trans-nats after the pseudogene formation such selection pressure to preserve a region of complementarity to the parental gene suggests that these transcripts may be functioning as regulators of the parental gene. these results are not too sensitive to the quality of the alignment between est and pseudogene .

in the next paragraphs we show some examples of the trans-nats expressed in antisense to pseudogenes found in this study in more detail. details about these examples and about the complete set are in additional file  <dig> and 4: tables s <dig> and s <dig> 

a trans-nat expressed antisense of a pseudogene for a parental gene without cis-nat evidence
ai <dig>  aligns antisense to a pseudogene  and has a pas "aataaa" at position  <dig> , <dig> . the region of the pseudogene originating this trans-nat aligns to the 6th intron of the parental gene  in chromosome  <dig> . the identity between the pseudogene and the parental gene regions is 95% all over the  <dig> nt of the est, but the parental gene lacks the equivalent pas due to two mutations .

in agreement to this, there is no cdna evidence of the expression of a cis-nat in the corresponding region of alg <dig>  we propose that est ai <dig> represents a trans-nat that could interact with the pre-mrna of alg <dig>  another  <dig> ests support ai <dig>  alg <dig> encodes a protein glycosyl transferase that was associated to a severe congenital disorder of glycosylation producing death in early infancy  <cit> .

a trans-nat expressed antisense of a pseudogene for a parental gene with a corresponding cis-nat
aa <dig>  aligns antisense to a pseudogene  and has a pas at position  <dig> , <dig>  the corresponding pseudogene region is  <dig> % identical to a region less than  <dig> kb away  that includes an exon from gene kif <dig>  and flanking regions. additional est evidence supports the expression of both the trans-nat from the pseudogene and of a cis-nat from the parental gene using the equivalent antisense pas . kif <dig> is a homolog of drosophila melanogaster costal- <dig>  and as such it is expected to participate in the hedgehog signaling pathway, but its activity has not been yet experimentally studied.

a trans-nat expressed antisense of a pseudogene whose 3'-end region does not align to the parental gene
aa <dig>  aligns antisense the pseudogene to chromosome  <dig>  with pas "aataaa" at position  <dig> , <dig>  another  <dig> ests support this trans-nat 3' end. it is expressed in antisense of a processed pseudogene of gene wee <dig>  and aligns  to exons  <dig> and  <dig> of this gene in chromosome  <dig>  but not to the intron spanning them. the wee <dig> gene encodes the wee <dig> tyrosine kinase  <cit> , a key g <dig> phase cell cycle regulator. aa <dig> aligns well to the wee <dig> gene except for its 3'-end. in agreement to this, no evidence of cis-nat expression was found in the parental gene.

comparisons to other organisms show that this processed pseudogene is also present in chimpanzee  and orangutan , but not in the rhesus macaque . therefore, it seems that there is selection pressure to generate copies of this pseudogene in the hominoidea lineage, and trans-nats to wee <dig> may exist in other organisms, possibly in multiple copies. the next example, illustrates a case of multiplicity of antisense trans-nats from multiple pseudogene copies with more abundant evidence.

an ensemble of trans-nats expressed antisense of multiple pseudogene copies
trans-nats expressed antisense of pseudogenes can be duplicated through events of genomic duplication. we illustrate this with est aa <dig>  located in chromosome  <dig> , which represents a trans-nat with support from another  <dig> ests from different tissues  that terminate at the same pas. aa <dig> is highly complementary to nine regions in chromosome  <dig>  five of them in antisense to introns of four homologous protein coding genes of uncharacterized function:  and one pseudogene . therefore this transcript could potentially regulate four genes. three of those have evidence of expression of the corresponding antisense cis-nat. further est evidence suggests an additional trans-nat in chromosome  <dig> with homology to est aa <dig>  the possible regulatory interactions between such a matrix of four human genes, three cis-nats and two trans-nats seems complex.

examination of the genomes of other organisms shows the existence of equivalents of these pseudogenes in chromosome  <dig> of both the chimpanzee and the orangutan, and in chromosome  <dig> of the rhesus macaque , and no significant similarity in other organisms such as the marmoset  or rodents  . the phylogenetic analysis of the pseudogene sequences  suggests multiple independent replications of this pseudogene along the catarrhini lineage.

discussion
we have collected evidence of the expression of transcripts antisense of pseudogenes, which would be trans-nats of the corresponding parental genes. some of these transcripts are supported by one single est and we do not expect that all transcripts collected will represent true transcripts. however, even though our collection may contain false positives, when considered collectively our study indicates that these trans-nat sequences have higher similarity to their parental genes in the region  <dig> nt upstream their 3' ends. this similarity is distinctively higher than the sequence identity between pseudogenes and parental genes observed further upstream that region . this suggests that many of these transcripts are under selective pressure, evidenced by a mutation rate in that region lower than in other parts of the pseudogene; one possible interpretation of this observation is that many of these trans-nats are expressed and therefore that pseudogene formation results in the generation of trans-nats that could be functional.

some cases where cis-nat evidence was found in the parental gene suggest that a trans-nat can result from the pseudogenization of a gene with an already existing cis-nat; we found  <dig> cases where est evidence shows that such transcript antisense the parental gene is expressed. on the contrary, in  <dig> of the cases analysed, mutations of the corresponding pas in the parental gene suggest that further evolution led to the inactivation of an original cis-nat while the trans-nat in the pseudogene was maintained .

pseudogene trans-nats that arise by genetic duplication of entire cis-nats likely conserve surrounding cis-regulatory motifs that control their epigenetic regulation and their specific expression. evidence in this direction is given by the observation that in our selection of pseudogenes with trans-nats, the fraction of duplicated pseudogenes is dominant, as opposed to what was observed for the total set of human pseudogenes we used as source : formation of a duplicated pseudogene includes the introns of the gene and is more likely to include both the cis-nat and its surrounding control regions.

1the percentage of pseudogenes by type was obtained from the pseudogene.org database.

2from the subset of those where we detected trans-nat expression.

ten trans-nats expressed antisense of pseudogenes that lack sequence similarity in their 3'-end to the parental gene suggest an alternative mechanism of pseudogene trans-nat production. the example presented  has levels of above 90% identity to the sequence antisense of two consecutive exons of the parental gene spanning more than  <dig> nt. the region of the pseudogene corresponding to the 3' end of this trans-nat has no significant similarity to the parental gene. one possibility is that there was an original cis-nat in the parental gene whose 3'-end was deleted after the production of the pseudogene and the subsequent evolution of the trans-nat. other possibilities are that the trans-nat was formed by the insertion of the processed pseudogene on an existing transcription unit or that the trans-nat regulatory regions arose de novo for the pseudogene. at this point, we cannot provide evidence for any of these possibilities.

we have presented examples showing selective pressure acting along the hominoidea lineage for the duplication of genes and their cis-nats and trans-nats in particular chromosomal regions. such may result in ensembles of genes commonly regulated by groups of nats generated in their vicinity. several such regions with a high rate of local duplications have been described and their evolution among primates is under study but it is not yet clear whether they are accidents of evolution or confer a selective advantage  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our observations support pseudogene formation as a mechanism of functional trans-nat generation. our set of examples adds evidence for the importance of duplication mechanisms of genetic material for the generation of non-coding rnas and gives a plausible explanation for the generation of relatively large complementary transcripts like trans-nats.
