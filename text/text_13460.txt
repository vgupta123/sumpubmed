BACKGROUND
alternative splicing of mrna transcripts is one mechanism by which genomic complexity is generated from the surprisingly low number of genes currently estimated from the human genome sequence. the fraction of human genes subject to alternative splicing has risen from 5% in early predictions to at least 75% in a recent genome-wide exon study . there are examples of hundreds of alternative splicing events from a single gene, which may affect function by adding or deleting functional domains, changing affinities, and altering mrna stability. variable transcripts from a single gene are produced combinatorially through the selection of cassette exons, mutually exclusive exons, retained introns, alternative 3' or 5' splice sites, and alternative promoters or polya sites  <cit> .

specific alterations in splicing patterns have been found in association with cancers, many of which may play a functional role in transformation, motility and metastasis of tumor tissue. alternative splicing appears to affect key aspects of neoplasms by altering hormonal signaling, apoptosis and mediators of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. modifications in functionality may be generated, for example, through the deletion of a signaling domain, increased affinity for messenger ligands, or change in affinity or activity toward extracellular components. the latter frequently results in increased cell migration and invasion . although in most cases the relationship between specific splicing events and the etiology of cancer is largely unproven, alternative splicing presents novel targets for diagnostic and therapeutic measures.

abnormal splicing of several genes has been observed in tumors of colorectal origin, including cd <dig>  <cit> , muc <dig>  <cit> , srf  <cit> , ncam  <cit> , mlh, msh  <cit>  and members of the wnt pathway  <cit> . some of these alternately spliced gene products may have therapeutic utility as markers of the progression of the disease or as drug targets; however there are insufficient data supporting their relevance in larger clinical populations. individual patient differences, tissue complexity and lack of tools for comprehensive analysis of splice variation have made the task challenging.

we have analyzed both differential gene expression and alternative splicing in a small collection of colon cancers employing a microarray  targeting over a million putative exons. the exons can be virtually reassembled into over  <dig>  transcripts according to a range of annotation sources. the inclusiveness of the array design allowed a flexible gene expression analysis, initially targeting high confidence transcripts and then extending to a more speculative set.

cancer-specific splice variations were detected with experimental algorithms and candidate events were subsequently validated with rt-pcr. we found several splice variants, some of which have been previously associated with cancer, and several which have not. the majority of the identified splicing events affect mediators of cytoskeletal organization, the extracellular matrix or integrin signaling, and may be involved in cell migration and invasion.

RESULTS
array design
the genechip human exon  <dig>  st array was designed to be as inclusive as possible at the exon level, deriving from annotations ranging from empirically determined, highly curated mrna sequences to ab-initio computational predictions  <cit> . the array contains approximately  <dig>  million 5-μm features  grouped into  <dig>  million probesets interrogating over one million exon clusters . by comparison, the affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  gene expression array contains  <dig>  million 11-μm features comprising  <dig>  probesets. a probe selection region  represents a region of the genome  predicted to act as an integral, coherent unit of transcriptional behavior. in many cases, each psr is an exon; in other cases, due to potentially overlapping exon structures, several psrs may form contiguous, non-overlapping subsets of a true biological exon. the median size of psrs is  <dig> bp with a minimum of  <dig> bp. probes were not included for some psrs because the psr might be too small or contain highly repeated or otherwise problematic sequence. about 90% of the psrs are represented by  <dig> probes . such redundancy allows robust statistical algorithms to be used in estimating presence of signal, relative expression, and existence of alternative splicing.

the exon array does not include a paired mismatch feature for each perfect match feature, rather surrogate mismatch intensities are derived from  <dig> pooled "antigenomic" probes with the same gc content as each perfect match feature  <cit> . antigenomic sequences are not present in the human, rat or mouse genomes.

the exon array also serves as a gene-level expression array. the median number of probes for each refseq gene is 30– <dig> distributed along the entire length of the transcript, as compared to  <dig> probes mostly at the 3' end in the gc u <dig> plus array.

the plethora of exon architectures , the variations in confidences of transcript annotations, and the necessity of rapidly incorporating new genomic knowledge has led to a dynamic design for reconstituting exons into genes. a set of rules was created for virtually assembling the probesets  into transcript clusters  based on the confidence level of the supporting evidence and the juxtapositions of the exon borders  <cit> . in general, exons were merged into clusters depending on whether and how many higher confidence clusters or exons they overlap, whether they have common exact splice sites, and whether single orphan exons are bounded within another annotation.

the mapping between probesets and transcript clusters is defined by meta-probeset lists :

a) "core" : refseq and full-length genbank mrnas;

b) "extended" : cdna transcripts, syntenic rat and mouse mrna, and ensembl, microrna, mitomap, vegagene and vegapseudogene annotations;

c) "full" : ab-initio predictions from geneid, genscan, genscan suboptimal, exoniphy, rnagene, sgpgene and twinscan

the combination of merging rules and metaprobe sets means that some transcript clusters in the extended and full sets may contain regions  that derive from annotations of different confidence levels. of the  <dig>  million probesets, approximately  <dig>  are supported by full-length mrnas .

gene-level signal comparison between the u <dig> plus  <dig>  and exon arrays for normal tissue
prior to analyzing the colon cancer data, we present a brief comparison of the gene level signals from the exon array and affymetrix's standard gene expression array, the u <dig> plus  <dig>  for this, we utilize a subset of data from a panel of  <dig> normal tissues that was assayed in parallel on both arrays. the approach was to compare the relative signals from differentially expressed probesets that target the same transcript clusters on both arrays.

significant genes were determined by pair-wise comparisons between each set of the  <dig> tissues with p-values at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and 10- <dig>  genes were accepted into the analysis if they showed significant changes in at least one tissue type on both arrays and could be mapped to the same transcript cluster. at a p-value of  <dig> ,  <dig> probesets from the u <dig> plus  <dig> array and  <dig> transcript clusters from the core meta-probeset of the exon array were accepted and mapped to each other. on average, approximately  <dig>  probesets from the u <dig> plus  <dig> array mapped to each transcript cluster on the exon array. this disparity in numbers results because the u <dig> plus  <dig> array frequently has multiple independent probesets targeting the same transcript cluster, whereas the probesets are clustered and summarized into a single gene signal estimate on the exon array. for the  <dig> cases of multiple u <dig> plus  <dig> probesets interrogating the same gene, the mean of the individual signals was used as the signal estimate.

the distribution of signals for these  <dig> transcript clusters from the two array types for the breast tissue samples are shown in fig.  <dig>  to reduce the possible confounding effects of alternative splicing on the signal estimation, breast tissue was chosen rather than, e.g., brain or testes, which typically show high levels of splice variation. the most striking indication from the figure is the apparent shift of low expression signals from u <dig> plus  <dig>  to a relatively higher expression level  in the exon array. the u <dig> plus  <dig> also seems to give marginally higher signal at high expression levels.

fig.  <dig> shows the pairwise signal pattern between transcript clusters from the two arrays. for convenience, the plot has been divided into quadrants at a logged signal of  <dig> . the apparent shift of low expression signals in u <dig> plus  <dig> to higher expression in the exon array is confirmed by the scatterplot. quadrant iv  contains  <dig> transcript clusters while the converse situation in quadrant ii  contains only  <dig> transcript clusters. the overall correlation of the signals is  <dig> , and the linearity of the data appears to be skewed by the shift of the signals at the low end. as the p-value for gene selection becomes more stringent, the correlation increases .

gene-level expression changes in colon cancer for the core and full gene sets
the initial analysis of expression changes in colon cancer targeted core genes, composed of nearly  <dig>  transcript clusters based on highly confident supporting evidence. subsequent to anova analysis, a threshold cutoff was set to p-values less than  <dig>  and at least a 2-fold geometric change in gene-level expression between normal and tumor samples. this yielded  <dig> significantly up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes in the tumor samples .

the most heavily represented classes of over-expressed genes in the tumor samples encompass mitosis, the cell cycle, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and dna repair and recombination . one large group involves rna processing , including at least  <dig> participating in rna splicing. components or modulators of the extracellular matrix are also heavily represented , many of which have been implicated in cell invasion and metastasis.

many of the significantly down-regulated genes represent normal colon functions that are lost as the tissue becomes undifferentiated, such as aquaporin  <dig>  which is normally present only in colon and pancreas  <cit> . however, the decreased expression of two hormones, somatostatin and pyy, and hif3a, a negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible genes, may actively potentiate carcinogenesis  <cit> .

pathway analysis  indicates that the over-expressed genes largely populate a dense network involved in cell proliferation and migration, including vegf-a, plau and met , which have been implicated in control of cellular invasion and in colon cancer specifically  <cit> . in this mapping, vegf-a lies at the center of a network involved in collagen metabolism. control of cell proliferation is centered around casein kinase iia and β-catenin, which is a key mediator of wnt signaling  <cit> . other functions represented in the network include anti-apoptosis, proteolysis, chemotaxis and response to hypoxia.

the gene-level analysis was repeated with the more speculative full metaprobe set representing  <dig>  transcript clusters, i.e., putative genes generated from exon clusters without strong empirical support. anova analysis produced  <dig> genes with differential expression between normal and cancerous tissue. excluding  <dig> genes that were also found in the core gene analysis leaves  <dig> genes found only in the expanded analysis, of which  <dig> have some annotation . of the  <dig> remaining completely unannotated putative genes,  <dig> have significant expression  in at least one tissue type.

workflow for the detection of splice variants
we introduce here a workflow  for detecting alternative splicing events between normal and cancerous samples using algorithms that normalize exon signals to the gene-level signal for each sample, followed by a tissue-specific anova  or t-test  <cit> . given the limited number of samples, the various stages of cancer progression and the aberrant behavior of several sample pairs, the data were expected to be noisy. to compensate, the data were filtered by multiple methods at both exon-level and gene-level to reduce problematic cases. each combination of filtering and algorithms produced some viable candidates, but the most stringent filtering generally showed the best consistency with pcr validation results. the method ultimately producing the highest proportion of true positives was to retain only: a) exons with a dabg p-value <  <dig> , b) genes with a signal >  <dig>  c) exons with a log ratio between tissues  >  <dig> , d) splicing index p-values <  <dig>  and e) core exons.

this filtering method generated  <dig> putative splicing events , including  <dig> of the  <dig> genes eventually unambiguously validated by pcr . another confirmed splicing event in cttn barely missed the threshold with a fold change of  <dig> . most of the positively validated splicing events were concentrated high in the p-value list, with col6a <dig> and actn <dig> as the top two. the clearest pcr validations generally resulted from candidates  that consistently ranked highly regardless of the algorithm or filtering method used. conversely, most of the negatively performing genes in pcr validation resulted from attempts to extend the limits of our search or to test other filtering approaches. in each case, the candidates were evaluated and further filtered by visualizing the probeset intensities within the genomic context .

rt-pcr validation of differential splicing in colon cancer
in order to empirically assess the presence or absence of putatively spliced exons, pcr primers were designed on adjacent constitutively expressed exons, in some cases spanning several target exons. some of the validated differential splicing events are shown in fig.  <dig>  one of the two tumor samples characterized as poorly differentiated was consistently prototypical of the alternative splicing patterns of these genes . a common artifact affecting rt-pcr of alternatively spliced mrnas appears in some of the gels  as an unidentified band migrating just below the largest band. this band represents a heteroduplex of the two alternatively spliced forms  <cit> .

altogether, forty-three genes were tested by rt-pcr, drawn primarily from the filtering method described above. nine candidate genes  showed clear differential alternative splicing in colon cancer relative to normal colon tissue, with two events occurring in col6a <dig>  an additional five genes showed positive results for discriminatory splicing but with some ambiguity. of the other tested genes,  <dig> exhibited alternative splicing but were not distinctive between normal and cancerous tissues, and  <dig> showed no evidence of alternative splicing . in total, approximately one-third of the  <dig> tested splicing events gave positive results in the pcr validation. each of the validated splicing events derive from the core annotation set, and are found in refseq or genbank, usually as cassette-type or mutually exclusive exons.

validated splicing events
alpha-actinin  <dig>  and vinculin  encode cytoskeletal elements that interact with actin and probably participate in the attachment of the cytoskeleton to the membrane. exons 19a and 19b of actn <dig> appear to be mutually exclusive exons, with 19a predominant in tumor samples and 19b predominant in normal samples . exon  <dig> of vcl is a cassette exon that tends to be skipped in these tumor samples.

atp2b <dig> belongs to the family of ion transporters that exhibits many isoforms with alternatively spliced exons regulated in a tissue-specific manner. exon  <dig> is a known cassette-type exon that is found here in normal colon tissue but is relatively reduced in tumor samples. atp2b <dig> plays a role in cellular calcium homeostasis that may be altered in tumor cells in parallel to the loss of ion transporters seen at the gene level.

variants of caldesmon , a structural element linking myosin and actin filaments, tend to include exon  <dig> and an extended exon  <dig> in normal cells. slc3a <dig> encodes the heavy chain of a heterodimeric solute carrier, but also participates in integrin signaling  <cit> . transcripts for slc3a <dig> are shifted to a higher molecular weight, indicating the inclusion of various combinations of exons  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in tumor samples that are much less prevalent in normal tissue. transcripts for the matrix protein collagen iv-3a  tend to include the cassette exons  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  in tumor samples to a greater extent than in normal samples.

cortactin  also has roles both in cell adhesion and organization of the cytoskeleton. exon  <dig> is a cassette exon that appears to be equally likely to be included or skipped in normal tissue, but in the tumor samples, the predominant form is inclusion of exon  <dig>  fibronectin  can be found in the extracellular matrix or at the cell surface, and has a role in cell adhesion and migration. a cassette exon, exon  <dig>  is more prevalent in normal tissues than in tumor samples.

tropomyosin  <dig>  is also an actin-binding protein, has a number of known splice variants, and is involved in the contraction of muscle and in the cytoskeleton of non-muscle cells. since exons  <dig> and  <dig> of tpm <dig> are mutually exclusive exons of approximately the same size, the alternative amplificates were distinguished by a restriction enzyme that cuts ex <dig>  but not ex <dig>  the fragments of ex <dig> appear as two faster moving bands that are more prevalent in the tumor samples.

densitometric scans of the gel bands were used to quantitate the observed splice variants . the ratio of the intensity of the alternative bands was calculated and compared across the tissue types as a log ratio. the densitometric analysis suggests that the strongest and most consistent changes occurred in actn <dig>  atp2b <dig>  vcl and cald <dig>  tpm <dig> and cttn also showed strong splicing differences between the tissues, but with higher variability. all of the tested events show a p-value of <  <dig>  in the t-test across the tissues except for ex <dig> of col6a <dig>  for which the splice variants are more apparent visually than in the scan.

validation of previously reported splicing events
we also tested for the presence of several alternative splicing events that were previously reported in colon cancers  <cit> , but were not strongly indicated by our statistical analysis. the expected splicing events in rac <dig>  vegf, siahbp <dig> and mst1r were weak or absent in these samples . integrin beta <dig>  tends to skip exon  <dig> and cd <dig>  <cit>  shows alternative splicing in about half the patient samples.

the relevant exons in cd <dig> did not score well in our detection analysis, probably because of the inconsistency in the splicing pattern. densitometric analysis of cd <dig>  confirms strong splice variation between the tissues, but with a high variability across samples. note that the advanced tumor sample in lane  <dig>  the most predictive for our differential splice patterns, does not display alternative splicing of cd <dig> 

vegf has a potentially complex splicing pattern, with possible combinations of ex6a, ex6b, extended ex6a and ex <dig>  mccullough et al.  <cit>  attempted to resolve this complexity with a mass spectrometry-based method that indicated that the majority of the transcripts in normal colon lack exon  <dig>  whereas we find that about half of the transcripts migrate consistently with inclusion of exon  <dig>  the results from cd <dig> and vegf underscore the difficulty of detecting relatively subtle alterations in small, heterogeneous sample populations.

pathway analysis of validated splicing events
analysis of the alternatively spliced genes with metacore software produced a network  that can be roughly divided into two areas of cellular function. cell motility and organization of the actin cytoskeleton functions include the alternatively spliced products of tpm <dig>  actn <dig>  vcl, cald <dig> and cttn, while cell adhesion and matrix organization includes those of col6a <dig>  fn <dig>  vcl, itgb <dig> and cd <dig> 

comparison to bioinformatic methods of estimating alternative splicing
several bioinformatic approaches have been developed to identify splice variation between normal tissue types or normal versus tumor tissues. these methods rely on mapping ests or mrnas onto refseq transcripts or genomic sequence, making frequency counts of various isoforms, and applying a statistical test to detect differential inclusion of exons in different tissues. the methods vary somewhat in research focus, basic algorithms, statistical methods , est source libraries, and mechanisms of normalizing or filtering out differential gene expression, but the essential approach is similar. we compared our empirical data from the exon array to three lists of the cancer-associated splicing events computationally predicted in wang, et al.  <cit> , the virtual sage-filtered list of kirschbaum-slager et al.  <cit>  and in the basd database described in hui, et al.  <cit> . when evaluating the results, it must be kept in mind that these bioinformatic approaches assay either tumors generally or a range of tumor types, but not specifically colon cancer .

the splicing events derived from the three methods were mapped to unigene gene symbols where possible and compared to the top  <dig> candidate splicing events from the exon array, which corresponds to  <dig> genes . our list of candidates matched approximately an equal proportion of each est-derived list, between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genes in each set: 12/ <dig> for kirschbaum-slager et al., 33/ <dig> for basd and 13/ <dig> for wang et al. altogether,  <dig> of our  <dig> candidate genes are found in at least one list. a simple chi-squared test indicates that elements of each list are highly overrepresented in each of the other lists . the strongest association between the exon-array candidates was with the basd list, most likely because of the increased statistical power of this larger data set. the est-based prediction sets showed a similar distribution of association to each other as our candidate gene list did to each of them.

among our  <dig> validated candidates, three  appeared in the basd list, two  appeared on the list of wang et al., and none appeared on the list of kirschbaum-slager et al. of the six previously reported alternatively spliced genes tested here, two  are found in basd, two  are found in the list of wang et al. and one  appears on the list of kirschbaum-slager et al. cd <dig>  siahbp <dig> and vegf do appear in our list of  <dig> candidate genes, but none ranked in the top  <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
there are many design differences between the exon array and the u <dig> plus 2: feature size, the number of probes per probeset, the number of probesets per transcript, background calculation, the assay procedure, etc. the most obvious difference is that the exon array interrogates exons/subexons throughout the transcript, while the u <dig> plus  <dig> generally targets only the 3' end. alternative splicing and, particularly, alternative polyadenylation sites may account for substantial differences in gene signal estimation. furthermore, our method of averaging the signal value of multiple probesets targeting the same transcript on the u <dig> plus  <dig> is only a rough compromise. despite the many differences, the gene-level comparison demonstrated a reasonable correlation in signals for genes that are significantly different between tissue types. the most notable difference in signal estimations is the shift of apparently low expressing genes on the u <dig> plus  <dig> array to higher signals on the exon array. since the exon array generally contains  <dig> to  <dig> times as many probes per transcript as the u <dig> plus  <dig> array and the probesets are distributed throughout the transcript cluster, the exon array may be more sensitive in detecting a subset of low expressing genes, at least in this data set. resolution of, for example, the portability of results between the arrays types, or the characteristics of transcripts that are differentially detected, will require several dedicated studies, for which data is becoming available.

among the  <dig> genes differentially expressed in the core gene set,  <dig> have been previously identified as participating in cancers, with  <dig> specifically in colon or colorectal cancer. almost one third of the up-regulated genes are part of a tightly interconnected network involved in mitosis, cell cycle control, cell proliferation, invasion, matrix remodeling and wnt signaling. constitutive activation within the wnt signaling pathway has been a prevalent theme in colon cancers, in particular the role of β-catenin  <cit> . eight of the over-expressed genes here  are targets of wnt/β-catenin regulation and two other wnt-associated genes, sox <dig> and hig <dig>  are up-regulated in these colon cancer samples.

twenty nine of the tumor-expressed genes have unknown or weakly annotated functions, but several may be involved in cell proliferation or apoptosis  and at least eight have previously been associated with various cancers . thirteen putative transcriptional regulators and most of the genes classified as signal transducers have unknown biological roles. another seven genes annotated only as "hypothetical protein" or "open reading frame"  are strongly expressed above background. the expanded analysis based primarily on ab-initio exon predictions identified  <dig> more genes with significant expression even though they completely lack previous annotation . these transcripts with unknown functions may represent a novel set of targets for study in colon cancer oncology and demonstrate the exploratory power of an inclusive array design.

we have identified a number of genes that are differentially spliced between normal and cancerous tissue. most of the tissue-specific alternative splicing events that were experimentally validated occurred in genes involved in cytoskeletal structure, the extracellular matrix or cell-cell interactions. some of these events are reported splice variants that occur in a tissue-specific manner and may represent a loss of tissue function as colonic epithelial and smooth muscle cells dedifferentiate, rather than abetting transformation or metastasis. determination of the role of these splice events requires more detailed study, but in most cases these genes have previously been implicated with active roles in the progression of tumors.

five of the genes  that we found to be alternatively spliced in colon cancer have actin-binding domains and play a direct role in the organization or structure of the cytoskeleton. remodeling of the cytoskeleton is fundamental in proliferation, apoptosis, cell invasion and metastasis  <cit> .

tpm <dig> appears to act as a tumor suppressor by promoting anoikis   <cit> . down-regulation of tpm <dig> by oncogenic transformation results in a loss of actin stress fibers  <cit> , whereas restoration of tpm <dig> inhibits cell migration in metastatic cell lines  <cit> . a splice variant of one of the low molecular weight isoforms of tropomyosin has been found specifically in association with colonic polyps and adenomas, but not normal colon tissue  <cit> .

actinin is a component of stress fibers and links the cytoskeleton to adherens-type junctions. it plays a role in cell migration probably by facilitating detachment of focal adhesions distal to the direction of movement  <cit> . alternative splicing of actinin- <dig>  which has a high sequence similarity to actn <dig>  apparently leads to an abnormal cytoskeleton in small cell lung cancer  <cit> . actn <dig> also has a binding site for vcl, and the two proteins cooperate to organize the cytoskeleton at adhesion junctions  <cit> .

cald <dig> binds actin and responds to calmodulin to promote stress fibers and focal adhesions, and cald1-defective cells are highly impaired in motility  <cit> . in cells transformed by kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus  or v-erbb, hypermethylation of cald <dig> and recruitment of its product into membrane complexes is linked to the loss of cytoskeletal microfilaments  <cit> .

cttn, frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and squamous cell carcinomas, is highly enriched at tumor invasion fronts  <cit> . two conformational forms of cttn are known, with both forms present in normal cells, but the apparently larger one  is more prevalent in colorectal cancers  <cit> . two splice variants that affect cell mobility have been previously identified: sv- <dig>  and sv- <dig> . sv- <dig> and full-length cttn were equally abundant in normal cells while sv- <dig> was barely detectable. sv- <dig>  but not sv- <dig>  can bind and crosslink actin, but overexpression of either form interferes with cell migration  <cit> . our results indicate that transcripts with or without exon  <dig> are approximately equal , but transcripts carrying exon  <dig>  are relatively more abundant in colon cancer samples, suggesting that these cells may be more competent for motility.

alternative splicing of fn <dig>  cd <dig> and col6a <dig> may play some role in matrix remodeling and/or cell migration in colon cancer, though col6a <dig> has not been previously implicated in this role. fibronectin was one of the consistently up-regulated genes in an artificial selection for highly metastatic cell lines, which also identified actn <dig> and several collagens  <cit> . two splice variants of fn <dig> have been implicated in the neo-vasculature of a variety of human tumors but not in normal adult tissues, however the role of these species in tumor-related angiogenesis is unclear  <cit> . alternatively spliced fn <dig> containing an extra domain has been found frequently in cancers  <cit> , whereas we find preferential skipping of exon  <dig> in tumor tissues. cd <dig> is involved in both cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions as well as connections to the actin cytoskeleton via ankyrin. the variably spliced region of cd <dig>  is preferentially included in many cancer types and appears to affect cell migration, invasion and metastasis  <cit> .

integrin itgb <dig> interacts with the intermediate filament network, stimulates the ras and pi3-k signaling pathways, and appears to be important for cell invasion in colon cancer  <cit> . slc3a <dig>  which functions in transmembrane transport, associates with integrins and appears to participate in integrin-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth and tumorigenesis in 3t <dig> fibroblasts  <cit> . the inclusion of several exons of slc3a <dig> in colon cancer transcripts may represent a tumor-specific alteration of its role in integrin signaling.

of the eleven differentially spliced genes we found or confirmed, ten are involved in the organization of the cytoskeleton or interaction with the matrix or other cells. seven of these genes  have previously been implicated in cancers, and, in five cases, specific splice variants are correlated with the cancerous state. this grouping may represent a coherent, and possibly coordinated, set of alterations which may impact cell mobility and extracellular interactions. a similar concentration of splice variants was found in mouse brain, where targets of the nova splicing regulon are clustered into functions affecting synaptic transmission and cell morphology. in fact, the targets appear to act as a modular network that impacts not only signaling functions, but also specifically the actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix and cell-cell adhesion  <cit> . it is possible that a similar splicing network is altered in colon cancer to produce the complex of interacting splice variants seen in this study. such patterns may be more apparent in a highly parallel genome-wide exon analysis than in traditional methods involving gene-by-gene searches.

one assumption of this type of analysis is that biologically important splicing changes would consistently appear in samples of a particular category . in some cases, our samples did not reproduce some previously reported events , or else the changes were sporadic . furthermore, we find differences even in normal samples with regard to exon  <dig> of vegf compared to the mass spectrometry results of mccullough et al.  <cit> . in fact, the most relevant splicing change in vegf for tumorigenesis may be a splice variant involving exon  <dig>  <cit> . in this situation, it may be difficult to resolve what the normal and abnormal states are for vegf. inconsistent results may be due to differences in samples, experimental procedures, analyses or interpretations, suggesting that conclusions about subtle changes in splicing may need to be reinforced by multiple sources. on the other hand, many of our validated splicing events have been observed in several other instances. nearly identical patterns of differential alternative splicing was found in colon tumors by okumura et al. for tpm <dig>  actn <dig> and itgb <dig>  and these patterns were even more emphatic in tumor cell lines. interestingly, differential splicing of cd <dig> in colon cancer was not observed in that study  <cit> . itgb <dig> and tpm <dig> were identified by an est-based analysis, and experimentally validated as differentially spliced in several tumor types  <cit> . the alternative splicing of cttn is consistent with protein alterations seen in association with colon cancer  <cit> . our sample set ranged from well differentiated to poorly differentiated  tumors, yet actn <dig>  atp2b <dig>  vcl and cald <dig> show strong and consistent changes across our samples . the presence of these splice variants in multiple tumor stages argues that they must be both early and persistent events. finally, differences in splicing patterns may be due to biologically important differences in cancer etiology, and therefore be useful indicators of tumor subtypes or stages.

with the large amount of est and genomic data available, a great deal of useful information may be gained from in silico prediction of transcript isoforms. validation rates from such methods have been fairly high and the resulting pattern of predictions are mostly in line with empirical data. there are a number of potential hazards in this approach: est libraries are highly variable in quality and reliability, it is difficult to account for differential gene expression, and tissues and individual genes are unevenly represented. almost 45% of est libraries are from cancer samples  <cit>  and 70% of mrnas in genbank are cloned from tumor samples  <cit> , leading to a strong bias against identifying isoforms present in normal tissues. also, in spite of various methods to remove or normalize differentially expressed genes, this factor may lead to overprediction  <cit> . the exon array addresses many of the difficulties by providing an empirical platform that is unbiased with regard to tissue or gene representation, and allows for direct normalization of differential gene expression. while a substantial proportion  of our top candidates for alternative splicing matched predictions from three est-derived methods, only four of our validated splicing events appeared among the  <dig> genes with bioinformatically predicted splice variants. this suggests that there are substantial gaps in current est databases that must be addressed empirically.

the splicing changes seen here are not necessarily as dramatic as seen in a previous study of  <dig> pure normal tissues with an exon-based microarray . this highlights the subtlety of most splicing events, which are typically not an all-or-none phenomenon, so sample size and homogeneity are important considerations. in spite of limitations which are frequently encountered in cancer and other tissue studies in humans, such as a modest sample size, heterogeneous tissues, and multiple categorical variables , we were able to identify and validate a number of candidate colon cancer-specific splicing events. exploration of alternative splicing will promote understanding of cancer etiology and may provide therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers  <cit> .
