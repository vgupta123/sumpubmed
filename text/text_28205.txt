BACKGROUND
leaves of soybean  merr.) contain a variety of flavonol glycosides  that are derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol  <cit> . buzzell and buttery  <cit>  proposed four flavonol glycoside alleles, viz., fg <dig> -glucoside present), fg <dig> -rhamnoside present), fg <dig> -glucoside present), and fg <dig> -rhamnoside present). these alleles are defined by their ability to bind glucose or rhamnose at either position 2″ or 6″ to the glucose moiety that is bound to the 3-position of flavonols. later, buzzell and buttery  <cit>  reported a new allele of the fg <dig> locus, resulting in a series of alleles, fg2-a, fg2-b and fg <dig>  fg <dig> and fg <dig> are linked with a recombination frequency of 12% in the molecular linkage group c <dig>   <cit> . plants with the fg1fg <dig> alleles have a lower rate of photosynthesis, lower leaf chlorophyll concentration, lower leaf weight, and lower seed yield  <cit> . further, fg <dig> and fg <dig> control waviness of leaf margins in soybean  <cit> .

glycosyltransferases  catalyze the transfer of sugar moieties from activated donor molecules to specific acceptor molecules, forming glycosidic bonds  <cit> . gts are classified into at least  <dig> families . the family  <dig> glycosyltransferase, referred to as udp glycosyltransferases , comprise the largest group in plants. ugts catalyze the transfer of a glycosyl moiety from udp sugars to a wide range of acceptor molecules including flavonoids  <cit> .

rojas rodas et al.  <cit>  performed genetic analysis using rils derived from a cross between koganejiro and kitakomachi which are soybean cultivars with gray pubescence. fgs of koganejiro had rhamnose at the 6″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol, whereas fgs of kitakomachi were devoid of rhamnose. the presence of 6″-rhamnose was controlled by a single gene. they cloned a candidate gene, gmf3g6″rt, in the molecular linkage group o . the recombinant gmf3g6″rt protein converted udp-rhamnose and kaempferol 3-o-glucoside or kaempferol 3-o-galactoside to kaempferol 3-o-rutinoside or kaempferol 3-o-robinobioside, proving that gmf3g6″rt encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  rhamnosyltransferase and corresponds to the fg <dig> gene. thus, either glucose or galactose was attached to the 3-position of kaempferol partially contradicting buttery and buzzell  <cit>  who reported that only glucose was attached to the 3-position. in addition, fgs having rhamnose at the 4″-position of 3-o-galactose, kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl-- and kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl-- have been identified in the leaves of soybean  <cit> , suggesting the existence of flavonol 3-o-galactoside  rhamnosyltransferase in soybean. hence, the genetic control of fg biosynthesis proposed by buttery and buzzell  <cit>  should be revised. overall, glucose or galactose is attached to the 3-position of kaempferol or quercetin in the biosynthesis of fgs in soybean leaves. glucose can be attached to the 2″- or 6″-positions of glucose or galactose whereas rhamnose can be attached to the 2″-, 4″- or 6″-positions, resulting in a wide variety of fgs  <cit> .

preliminary experiments suggested that a japanese landrace, nezumisaya, and a canadian cultivar harosoy, both with gray pubescence, had different fg compositions in leaves . the first objective of this study was to identify genes for fg biosynthesis and locate them in the soybean genome using rils derived from a cross between nezumisaya and harosoy. the second objective was to clone and verify their function.

methods
plant materials
nezumisaya with yellow hilum, yellow seed coats, gray pubescence and purple-blue flowers  was crossed with harosoy with yellow hilum, yellow seed coats, gray pubescence and purple flowers . flowers of nezumisaya were emasculated one day before opening and fertilized with pollen from harosoy in  <dig>  hybridity of f <dig> plants was ascertained based on the presence of purple flowers. a total of  <dig> rils of f <dig> generation were developed without any selection by the single-seed descent method. seeds were planted at the national institute of crop science, tsukuba, japan  on june  <dig>   <dig>  n, p, and k were applied at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  g m− <dig>  respectively. plants were individually planted  <dig> cm apart within rows that were spaced  <dig> cm apart. on average, nine plants were grown for each parent and ril.

extraction of fgs
a total of  <dig> rils was randomly selected and used for analysis because pcr reaction plates and electrophoresis apparatus were designed for multiples of  <dig> samples . trifoliolate leaves were collected in bulk from  <dig> plants from the parents and the rils at r <dig> stage  <cit> . sampling of leaves and preparation of hplc samples were performed as previously described  <cit> . ten μl from each sample was subjected to high performance liquid chromatography  analysis.

ssr analysis and linkage mapping
genomic dna of the parents and the four plants from each of the rils used for fg analysis were isolated from trifoliolate leaves by the ctab method  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ssr markers developed by usda  <cit>  and by the kazusa dna research institute  <cit>  were used for screening of polymorphisms among the parents. ssr analysis was performed as previously described  <cit> . the markers were tested by chi-square analyses for segregation in 1: <dig> ratio. a linkage map of the genotypic data for the  <dig> rils was constructed using the mapmaker/exp. ver.  <dig>   <cit>  with the threshold lod score of  <dig> . designation of linkage groups followed cregan et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
flavonol glycoside composition
hplc chromatograms of harosoy and nezumisaya are shown in figure 1a. harosoy had eight primary peaks corresponding to fgs, viz.,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  min . nezumisaya had seven primary peaks, viz.,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  . based on comparison with authentic specimens, the peaks correspond to the followings fgs: f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-glucosyl--galactoside; f4: kaempferol 3-o-glucosyl--glucoside; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--galactoside; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl--glucoside; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-glucoside; f <dig>  apigenin 7-o-glucoside; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-glucosyl--; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-glucosyl--; f <dig>  kaempferol glycoside; f <dig>  kaempferol 3-o-glucosyl--glucoside; f <dig>  kaempferol glycoside .figure  <dig> hplc chromatogram of meoh extracts from leaves of soybean cultivars nezumisaya, harosoy and recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross of the cultivars, and chemical structure of flavonol glycosides corresponding to hplc peaks.  hplc chromatogram.  <dig> mg of trifoliolate leaves was extracted with  <dig> ml of meoh. eluent: phosphoric acid/acetonitrile/h2o . flow-rate:  <dig>  ml/min. injection:  <dig> μl. detection:  <dig> nm.  chemical structure.



the peaks f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> that were specific to nezumisaya corresponded to fgs having glucose at the 2″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol, whereas fgs with 2″-glucose were absent in harosoy. the peaks f <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> that were specific to harosoy corresponded to fgs having glucose at the 6″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol, whereas fgs with 6″-glucose were absent in nezumisaya.

inheritance of flavonol glycoside composition
among the  <dig> rils cultivated in field,  <dig> rils matured too early for sampling. the remaining  <dig> rils were subjected to hplc analysis. among the rils,  <dig> rils had peaks of the harosoy-type, and  <dig> rils had peaks of the nezumisaya-type.  <dig> rils had a peak distribution designated as ‘type 3’; this lacked three peaks  compared with the harosoy-type . further,  <dig> rils were designated as ‘type 4’; these had a mixture of peaks from both cultivars in addition to a unique peak, f <dig>  the segregation fitted to a 1:1:1: <dig> ratio, suggesting that two genes control the fg pattern in the ril .

one of the genes may be responsible for attachment of glucose to the 2″-position and it probably encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. nezumisaya may have a dominant while harosoy may have a recessive allele of the gene. the other gene may be involved in the attachment of glucose to the 6″-position and probably encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. harosoy may have a dominant while nezumisaya may have a recessive allele of the gene. rils of ‘type 3’, in which fgs with 2″-glucose and fgs with 6″-glucose were absent, may have double-recessive alleles of the two genes. rils of ‘type 4’, in which fgs with 2″-glucose and fgs with 6″-glucose were present, may have double-dominant alleles.

linkage mapping of flavonol glycoside gene
among the  <dig> ssr markers tested,  <dig> markers that exhibited polymorphism between the parents and distinctly segregated in the rils were used for linkage mapping. a total of  <dig> markers were classified into  <dig> linkage groups spanning  <dig>  cm. for mapping of the gene responsible for attachment of glucose to the 2″-position, rils having fg composition of the nezumisaya type and ‘type 4’ were considered to have the genotype of nezumisaya, whereas rils having fg composition of the harosoy type and ‘type 3’ were considered to have the genotype of harosoy. linkage mapping revealed that the gene responsible for attachment of glucose to the 2″-position was located in the molecular linkage group c <dig>  between satt <dig> and sat_ <dig> .figure  <dig> linkage mapping of f3g2″gt using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between soybean cultivars nezumisaya and harosoy. the name of the linkage group is indicated at the top followed by the chromosome number in parenthesis. distances  of markers from the top of the linkage group are shown on the left.



molecular cloning of flavonol glycoside gene
survey of the genome sequence of a us cultivar williams  <dig> suggested the existence of a gene similar to the gt gene, glyma06g <dig> between satt <dig> and sat_ <dig>  the entire coding region of glyma06g <dig> was amplified by pcr and cloned. sequence analysis revealed that the open reading frame of glyma06g <dig> is  <dig> bp long encoding  <dig> amino acids. we designated the gene as gmf3g2″gt. gmf3g2"gt belongs to the family  <dig> glycosyltransferase, and it was designated as ugt79b <dig> by the ugt nomenclature committee  <cit> . the flavonoid glycosyltransferase phylogenetic tree suggested that gmf3g2″gt belongs to the flavonoid glycoside glycosyltransferase  gene cluster . blast analysis suggested that it had a 55% amino acid similarity with ip3ggt of morning glory encoding anthocyanin 3-o-glucoside  glucosyltransferase  <cit>  and 45% similarity with arabidopsis ugt79b <dig> that was recently identified to function as a flavonol 3-o-glucoside  glucosyltransferase  <cit>  . comparison with the genome sequence of williams  <dig> suggested that gmf3g2″gt had one intron . eight nucleotides were polymorphic between harosoy and nezumisaya; consisting of six single nucleotide polymorphisms  and one two-nucleotide substitution. the nucleotide polymorphism resulted in four amino acid substitutions between the cultivars  . the cdna fragments generated from nezumisaya and harosoy were designated as gmf3g2″gt-a and gmf3g2″gt-b, respectively. the 5′ upstream region of about  <dig>  kb was amplified by pcr from harosoy, whereas the corresponding region could not be amplified from nezumisaya. so we cloned the 5′ upstream region of both cultivars by genome walking. the nucleotide sequences of the 5′ upstream region, exons and introns of harosoy were identical with those of williams  <dig>  in contrast, nezumisaya had many indels and substitutions in the 5′ upstream region compared with harosoy .figure  <dig> unrooted molecular phylogenetic tree of some flavonoid glycosyltransferases. bar represents  <dig>  amino acid substitutions/site. the genbank accession numbers for the sequences are shown in parentheses: at3rt ; at3gt ; vv3gt ; ph3gt ; pf3gt ; hv3gt ; zm3gt ; at5gt ; pf5gt ; vh5gt ; ph5gt ; db7gt ; nt7gt ; sb7gt ; at7rt ; cmf7g2″rt ; csf7g6″rt ; ipa3g2″gt ; pha3g6″rt ; bpa3g2″glt ; aca3ga2″xt ; atf3g2″gt . gt, glucosyltransferase; rt, rhamnosyltransferase; xt, xylosyltransferase; glt, glucuronosyltransferase. ac, actinidia chinensis; at, arabidopsis thaliana; bp, bellis perennis; cm, citrus maxima; cs, citrus sinensis; db, dorotheanthus bellidiformis; gm, glycine max; hv, hordeum vulgare; ip, ipomoea purpurea; nt, nicotiana tabacum; pf, perilla frutescens; ph, petunia hybrida; sb, scutellaria baicalensis; vh, verbena hybrida; vv, vitis vinifera; zm, zea mays.

pcr products with molecular size of  <dig> bp were amplified with the dcaps primers in nezumisaya and harosoy . kpni digestion generated a band of  <dig> bp in harosoy, whereas the pcr amplicon of nezumisaya was unaffected. banding patterns co-segregated with fg patterns; rils with fgs of the harosoy type and ‘type 3’ had bands of harosoy type, whereas rils with fgs of the nezumisaya type and ‘type 4’ had bands of nezumisaya type .figure  <dig> outline and results of dcaps analysis of gmf3g2″gt in soybean.  schematic presentation of dcaps analysis. partial nucleotide sequences around the region polymorphic between harosoy and nezumisaya are exhibited. a mismatched base in the forward primer is highlighted in gray. polymorphic nucleotides are highlighted in black.  results of dcaps analysis of the parents and the recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between nezumisaya and harosoy. pcr products amplified with dcaps primers were digested by kpni and the digests were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. ϕ, molecular marker ϕx174/haeiii; n, nezumisaya; h, harosoy. fg pattern of the recombinant inbred lines is exhibited below the gel. h, harosoy-type; n, nezumisaya-type,  <dig>  type 3;  <dig>  type  <dig>  the migration of size markers  is shown to the left of the gel.



in vitro characterization of recombinant gmf3g2″gt
the gmf3g2″gt recombinant protein of nezumisaya  and harosoy  were expressed in e. coli as a his/pros <dig> fusion and purified. the gmf3g2″gt proteins were used for enzymatic assays after cleavage of the his/pros <dig> tag. gmf3g2″g-a and gmf3g2″g-b converted kaempferol 3-o-glucoside to kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside as confirmed by comparison of retention time, uv spectra and ms/ms ionization with the standard compound . gmf3g2″gt-a showed a broad activity for kaempferol/quercetin 3-o-glucoside/galactoside derivatives . however, gmf3g2″gt-a did not glucosylate kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl-- and 3-o-rhamnosyl--. gmf3g2″gt-a had a higher preference for udp-glucose than udp-galactose, with only 3% activity relative to that for udp-galactose. no ugt activity was detected for udp-arabinose and udp-glucuronic acid. gmf3g2″gt-b also showed similar substrate specificity . accordingly, gmf3g2″gt-a and gmf3g2″gt-b were defined as flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferases.figure  <dig> identification of reaction product of gmf3g2″gt-a .  elution profiles of the standards  and reaction product of gmf3g2″gt-a protein.  uv spectra of the standard  and reaction product of gmf3g2″gt-a protein. mass spectra  and ms/ms spectra  of the standard  and reaction product of gmf3g2″gt-a protein. e, the ms/ms fragmentation for kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside. k3glc, kaempferol 3-o-glucoside; k3glc2″glc, kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside.

gene expression
the accumulation of gmf3g2″gt transcript in leaves of nezumisaya and harosoy was analyzed by real-time pcr. survey of soybean genome sequence revealed the existence of a gene similar to gmf3g2″gt, glyma12g <dig> with nucleotide similarity of 93% in chromosome  <dig> . it was difficult to design primers for gmf3g2″gt based on the nucleotide sequence of its coding region. so, we designed primers for real-time pcr based on distinct sequences from the 5' untranslated region. at the r <dig> stage, the transcript level of gmf3g2″gt in leaves of harosoy was  <dig> % of that in nezumisaya . the pcr products from nezumisaya and harosoy were ascertained to be derived from the expected genome region by sequencing.

discussion
harosoy and nezumisaya are soybean cultivars that have gray pubescence and they both have significant deposits of kaempferol derivatives in their leaves. however, these cultivars differ in their fg composition. hplc comparison with authentic samples suggested that fgs having glucose at the 2″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol were present in nezumisaya, whereas fgs of harosoy were devoid of 2″-glucose. conversely, fgs having glucose at the 6″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol were present in harosoy, whereas these fgs were absent in nezumisaya. apigenin 7-o-glucoside almost exclusively deposits in the cytoplasm of gray pubescence  <cit> , suggesting that the peak f <dig> may have been derived from pubescence on leaves.

genetic analysis suggested that two genes control the fg pattern. one of the genes may be responsible for attachment of glucose to the 2″-position, and it probably encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. nezumisaya may have a dominant, whereas harosoy may have a recessive allele of the gene. the gene was mapped in molecular linkage group c <dig>  between satt <dig> and sat_ <dig>  judging from the relative location with ssr markers, its position was similar to that of fg <dig> reported by buzzell  <cit> . the other gene may be involved in the attachment of glucose to the 6″-position, and it probably encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. the gene may correspond to the fg <dig> gene reported previously  <cit> . harosoy may have a dominant whereas nezumisaya may have a recessive allele of the gene. the ‘type 3’ may have double-recessive alleles whereas the ‘type 4’ may have double-dominant alleles for the two fg genes. f <dig> probably corresponds to a kaempferol glycoside having both 2″-glucose and 6″-glucose.

a survey of the genome sequence of us cultivar williams  <dig> suggested that a putative gt gene, glyma06g <dig> existed between satt <dig> and sat_ <dig>  we cloned the cdna and designated it as gmf3g2″gt. the open reading frame of gmf3g2″gt is  <dig> bp long encoding  <dig> amino acids. gmf3g2″gt belongs to the ggt gene cluster. gmf3g2″gt of nezumisaya had an amino acid similarity of 55% with the ip3ggt of morning glory encoding a 3-o-glucoside  glucosyltransferase that also attaches glucose to the 2″-position of glucose that is bound to the 3-position of anthocyanidins  <cit> . it also has 45% similarity with arabidopsis ugt79b <dig> that functions as a flavonol 3-o-glucoside  glucosyltransferase  <cit> . the genome sequence of williams  <dig> suggests the existence of a gene  having 93% of nucleotide identity with glyma06g <dig> in chromosome  <dig>  however, the gene responsible for the attachment of glucose to the 2″-position was not mapped to chromosome  <dig> in the current as well as in a previous study  <cit> . thus, based on our experimental data, glyma12g <dig> may not be responsible for the attachment of glucose to the 2″-position.

in the coding region of gmf3g2″gt, six snps and one two-base substitution existed between harosoy and nezumisaya, resulting in four amino acid substitutions. the dcaps marker that was used to discriminate the two-base substitution co-segregated with the fg patterns, suggesting that gmf3g2″gt might correspond to a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase  gene.

the recombinant gmf3g2″gt-a protein converted udp-glucose and kaempferol 3-o-glucoside to kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside, proving that gmf3g2″gt encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. the protein did not discriminate between glucose and galactose attached to the 3-position of kaempferol based on the results of hplc analysis. hence, it is similar to the soybean flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  rhamnosyltransferase  <cit> . gmf3g2″gt-a protein showed a broad activity for kaempferol/quercetin 3-o-glucoside/galactoside derivatives, but it did not glucosylate kaempferol 3-o-rhamnosyl-- and 3-o-rhamnosyl--. this suggests that 2″-glucosylation of flavonol 3-o-glycoside is irreconcilable with 4″-glycosylation. this hypothesis is supported by the flavonoid profiles of nezumisaya and ‘type 4’ in which fgs with 2″ and 4″-double glycosylation are lacking. further, leaves of seven soybean accessions contained fgs with double glycosylation of 2″ and 6″, or 4″ and 6″, but lacked fgs with double glycosylation of 2″ and 4″  <cit> .

though four amino acids were substituted, the recombinant gmf3g2″gt-b protein also had a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase activity. a structural modeling of gmf3g2″gt using the 3d structure of a grape flavonoid 3-o-glucosyltransferase, vvgt <dig>  as a template indicated that three substituted amino acids  were located far from the enzyme active sites. the other amino acid  was relatively close to the uracil ring of udp-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose  but far from the active center. the threonine residues corresponding to t <dig> in gmf3g2″gt-b were also conserved in flavonoid 3-o-glucoside:  glucosyltransferase, such as atf3g2″gt and ipa3g2″gt. these data suggest that four substituted amino acid residues in gmf3g2″gt-b are unlikely to affect enzyme activity. the transcript level of gmf3g2″gt in leaves of harosoy was about 15% of that in nezumisaya. gmf3g2″gt protein possibly have a threshold for catalysis and that of harosoy is lower than the threshold. to confirm the hypothesis, further studies such as association analysis between gene expression and fg amounts among tissues or developmental stages may be necessary. indels and substitutions in the 5′ upstream region may be responsible for the differences in expression level. promoter assays may be necessary to determine which polymorphism is critical for gene expression.

the nucleotide sequences in the 5′ upstream region, exons and intron of gmf3g2″gt from harosoy were identical to those of williams  <dig>  the hplc chromatogram of leaf methanol extracts of williams  <dig> was identical to that of us cultivar clark which has an allelic combination of fg1fg2fg3fg <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that williams  <dig>  clark and harosoy might have a recessive allele at the fg <dig> locus . the results are consistent with our hypothesis that nezumisaya has a dominant and harosoy has a recessive allele for the fg <dig> gene. based on the hplc profiles, harosoy may have an allelic combination of fg1fg2fg3fg <dig> while nezumisaya may have a combination of fg1fg2fg3fg <dig>  this is consistent with a previous report that harosoy has an allelic combination of either fg1fg2fg <dig> or fg1fg2fg <dig> depending on the line  <cit> .

multiple alignment of ggts  suggested  <dig> amino acids specific to g6″gts and  <dig> amino acids specific to g2″gts . there are characteristic amino acids in position  <dig>  and amino acid position  <dig>  in the plant secondary product glycosyltransferase motif around the c-terminal region  <cit> . site-directed mutagenesis may reveal which amino acids are responsible for glycosylation of specific positions of the sugar moiety in flavonoids. amino acids responsible for sugar donor specificity  were identified in a ggt gene involved in saponin biosynthesis  <cit> . multiple alignment indicated that all three flavonoid g2″gts had thr at this position, suggesting a possibility that the amino acid is also involved in sugar donor specificity in flavonoid ggts . the gmf3g2″gt had only one intron, consistent with fg genes of other plant species, where either existence of no or one intron is predominant  <cit> .

cloning of fg <dig> encoding flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase and fg <dig> encoding flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  rhamnosyltransferase may help clarify the recognition mechanisms for the hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety , ability to specify the nature of the sugar , and molecular evolution of ugt genes. in addition, another gene having the function of flavonol 3-o-galactoside  rhamnosyltransferase remains to be cloned. cloning of the entire gene set may be necessary to understand fg biosynthesis in soybean. development of near-isogenic lines by incorporating various combinations of alleles for fg genes into common genetic backgrounds may be necessary to obtain information on the dosage effect of fg genes in relation to morphology, productivity and other agronomic characters in soybean.

CONCLUSIONS
fgs having glucose at the 2″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol were present in nezumisaya, whereas fgs of harosoy were devoid of 2″-glucose. conversely, fgs having glucose at the 6″-position of glucose or galactose that is bound to the 3-position of kaempferol were present in harosoy, whereas these fgs were absent in nezumisaya. two genes control the fg pattern; the first is responsible for the attachment of glucose to the 2″-position, and encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase. nezumisaya has a dominant whereas harosoy has a recessive allele of the gene. a candidate gene gmf3g2″gt was located in the molecular linkage group c <dig> . the open reading frame of gmf3g2″gt is  <dig> bp long encoding  <dig> amino acids with four amino acid substitutions among the cultivars. the gmf3g2″gt recombinant protein converted kaempferol 3-o-glucoside to kaempferol 3-o-sophoroside. hence, gmf3g2″gt encodes a flavonol 3-o-glucoside/galactoside  glucosyltransferase and corresponds to the fg <dig> gene. based on substrate specificity, 2″-glucosylation of flavonol 3-o-glycoside may be irreconcilable with 4″-glycosylation in soybean leaves.
