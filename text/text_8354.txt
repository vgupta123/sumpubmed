BACKGROUND
corynebacterium glutamicum is a gram-positive soil bacterium that is well-established for the industrial production of several l-amino acids  <cit> . the complete genome sequence of the type strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> is available  <cit> , and it was screened by bioinformatic tools to predict the repertoire of dna-binding transcription regulators in this organism  <cit> . transcription regulators represent key components in the control of bacterial gene expression and permit the cell to sense and respond to environmental changes  <cit> . amongst others, metal ion homeostasis in bacterial cells is tightly regulated by specific metal-sensing transcription regulators. these metalloregulatory proteins, in principle, sense the intracellular levels of specific metal ions by binding them to a metal binding site, which leads to conformational changes affecting the regulator's ability to bind operator sites in regulatory dna regions  <cit> . prominent protein families of metalloregulators are dtxr  <cit> , merr  <cit> , smtb/arsr  <cit> , and fur  <cit> . the ferric uptake regulator fur was originally described as iron-sensing repressor of genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis and iron transport in escherichia coli  <cit> , but fur also activates the expression of many genes by either direct or indirect mechanisms and can be regarded as global transcription regulator of iron homeostasis in e. coli  <cit> . numerous studies indicated a tremendous diversity in metal selectivity and biological function within the fur protein family that can be divided into sensors of iron , manganese , nickel , and zinc   <cit> .

zinc is considered an essential nutrient for all living organisms. as zinc can be toxic at large concentrations  <cit> , zinc uptake, efflux, storage, and metabolism is in general tightly regulated in bacteria  <cit> . during our work on reconstructing the transcriptional regulatory network of c. glutamicum  <cit> , we recognized the cg <dig> protein as candidate to control the zinc metabolism in this species, since it was classified as dna-binding transcription regulator of the fur family  <cit>  and iron metabolism is under global control of the dual regulator cg <dig>  a member of the dtxr protein family  <cit> . in this study, comparative whole-genome dna microarray hybridizations revealed a set of differentially expressed genes that are under transcriptional control by cg <dig> . comparative genomic analysis of zur regulons in actinobacteria detected candidate zur-binding sites within the mapped promoter regions of potential target genes in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  the dna binding of zur to these operator sites occurred in a zinc-dependent manner and was verified by dna band shift assays, providing clear evidence that zur is involved in zinc-dependent transcriptional regulation of gene expression in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> 

RESULTS
annotation of the corynebacterial zinc uptake regulator zur
the cg <dig>  protein of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> has a predicted size of  <dig> amino acids, a theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and belongs to the small core set of  <dig> transcription regulators that were detected in all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial genomes  <cit> . protein domain predictions performed with the superfamily  <cit>  and the conserved domain database tools  <cit>  showed that the zur protein contains an amino-terminal helix-turn-helix motif of the winged-helix type and is a member of the zur  subgroup of the fur  family of metalloregulatory proteins  <cit> . according to blastp data  <cit> , the c. glutamicum zur protein revealed high amino acid sequence similarities to orthologous proteins encoded in other sequenced corynebacterial genomes, ranging from 56% to 80% identical amino acids . furthermore, zur orthologues in other actinobacteria are well conserved and corroborated by the phylogenetic tree for these proteins . the zur orthologue in mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv  is the zinc metalloregulator furb, whose crystal structure has been elucidated recently  <cit> . the multiple alignment of zur proteins from actinobacteria demonstrates the conservation of all amino acid residues forming three distinct zinc binding sites in the furb protein . the zinc binding site  <dig> is surrounded by conserved aspartate, cysteine and histidine residues, whereas the zinc binding site  <dig> is represented by a cluster of four cysteines. the putative zinc binding site  <dig> is build by three histidines and one glutamate, but the exact biological function of this protein site remains to be determined  <cit> . these structural protein data strongly suggested that the cg <dig>  protein of c. glutamicum is a zinc-binding protein and involved in the transcriptional regulation of zinc metabolism in this species.

according to comparative genomic analysis, the cg <dig>  gene of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> is located in a conserved gene region in all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial genomes . in the genomes of c. glutamicum, c. efficiens, c. diphtheriae, c. aurimucosum, and c. accolens, all representing members of the main lineage of the genus corynebacterium  <cit> , the zur gene is located downstream of another regulatory gene  encoding a putative metal-sensing transcription regulator of the smtb/arsr protein family  <cit> . in genomes of corynebacteria belonging to the c. jeikeium and c. kroppenstedtii branches, the overall location of the zur gene is also conserved, but an orthologue of znr is lacking in front of the zur coding region . since the orthologous protein of znr from m. tuberculosis h37rv  is apparently involved in zinc-dependent transcriptional regulation of the rv2358-furb operon  <cit> , the homologous znr-zur gene region of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> may also encode the regulatory switches involved in controlling the zinc homeostasis in this organism.

transcriptional organization of the znr-zur gene region in c. glutamicum
operon predictions for c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> suggested that the znr-zur genes are expressed as bicistronic transcript  <cit> . to provide experimental support for this prediction, the transcription of the znr-zur region was analyzed by marker gene expression using the green fluorescent protein encoded on the promoter-probe vector pepr <dig>  <cit> . both the znr upstream region and the znr-zur intergenic region were tested for promoter activity in e. coli dh5α mcr and c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> . for this purpose, a 141-bp dna fragment covering the znr upstream region and a 107-bp dna fragment containing the 40-bp znr-zur intergenic region were amplified by pcr and cloned in front of the promoterless gfp gene present on pepr <dig>  the expression of gfp was detected by fluorescence microscopy only with a pepr <dig> derivative containing the znr upstream region, indicating the presence of a promoter in front of znr and supporting the view that znr and zur are organized as operon. this observation was further strengthened by detecting with rt-pcr a 309-bp cdna fragment that encompasses the intergenic region on the znr-zur transcript . the promoter in front of the znr gene was deduced from race-pcr experiments with total rna purified from c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> cultures, showing that transcription starts at a guanine residue located  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the gtg start codon of znr . based on the known consensus motif for corynebacterial promoters  <cit> , potential - <dig>  and - <dig>  promoter regions with an 18-bp spacing and a putative up-element  <cit>  were detected .

computational identification of actinobacterial zur regulons
we applied comparative genomic techniques such as cross-genome comparison of shared regulatory sites  <cit>  to reconstruct zur regulons in the genomes of eight corynebacterium species, as well as other representative members of the taxonomic class actinobacteria . initially, we collected the upstream regions of candidate zinc uptake genes  in the analyzed actinobacterial genomes and applied the motif recognition program signalx. the identified 21-bp palindromic motif  was similar to previously identified zur-binding motifs in m. tuberculosis and s. coelicolor  <cit> . we constructed a positional-weight matrix for the identified zur-binding motif and applied it to scan the genomes of actinobacteria for additional candidate zur-binding sites. after filtering of false-positive sites by the consistency check approach and accounting for possible operon structures, we combined the final list of predicted members of the zur regulons in the analyzed genomes of actinobacteria  .

overall, a conserved core of the reconstructed zur regulons includes one or multiple paralogues of the zinc abc-type transporter znuacb and a putative p-loop gtpase of the cog <dig> family  <cit> , orthologues of the b. subtilis ycic protein  <cit> . in mycobacterium species, p. acnes, s. coelicolor, and l. xyli, the zur regulon includes paralogues of various ribosomal proteins . these observations are in agreement with the previously described zur-dependent regulation of ribosomal protein genes in m. tuberculosis and s. coelicolor  <cit> . the znr-zur operon is preceded by a candidate zur-binding site only in two mycobacterium species . the c. diphtheriae zur regulon includes the candidate abc-type metal transporter operon troa-sapd-dip0439-dip0440-dip0441-dip <dig> and the cmra gene encoding a surface-associated protein  <cit> . additional candidate zur-binding sites were detected upstream of the adha gene encoding zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase in c. glutamicum  <cit>  and adha orthologues in c. accolens and c. diphtheriae .

global gene expression profiling of the zur-mutant c. glutamicum js2502
to identify c. glutamicum genes that are under transcriptional control by zur, the zur gene was deleted in the chromosome of the wild-type strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> by an allelic exchange procedure, resulting in the mutant strain c. glutamicum js <dig>  growth of the zur-deficient mutant c. glutamicum js <dig> in minimal medium cgxii was indistinguishable from the parental wild-type strain , indicating that deregulation of the zur regulon is not detrimental to any basic physiological functions in c. glutamicum. the genome-wide expression profile of c. glutamicum js <dig> was compared with that of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> by dna microarray hybridizations. the resulting ratio/intensity  plot of the normalized data, based on two hybridization experiments with label swapping, is presented in fig.  <dig>  by applying a ratio cut-off of ±  <dig>  which is equivalent to relative expression changes of at least two-fold,  <dig> genes exhibited higher transcript levels in the zur mutant when compared to the wild-type strain, whereas three genes showed lower transcript levels in c. glutamicum js <dig> 

among the genes that are up-regulated in the zur mutant, we detected five c. glutamicum transcription units that are preceded by candidate zur-binding sites: cg2911-cg2912-cg <dig>  cg0040-cg0041-cg0042/cg <dig> and cg0794/cg <dig> . the first two operons encode components of the putative zinc/manganese abc-type transporter znuacb and the putative secreted protein cg <dig>  whereas the latter genes encode a p-loop gtpase of the cog <dig> protein family  and a putative oxidoreductase of unknown physiological function , respectively. the adha gene, encoding a zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase  <cit>  and predicted to be a candidate member of the zur regulon with a conserved candidate zur-binding site , was not detected as differentially expressed by dna microarray hybridizations. in summary, genome-wide expression profiling and motif searches revealed six transcription units of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> that were considered as potential targets for a direct transcriptional control by the zinc-sensing repressor zur .

 <dig> genes listed without 21-bp motif  belong to predicted operons.

 <dig> the gene expression in c. glutamicum js <dig> was compared with that of the wild-type strain atcc  <dig>  array, m-values obtained by dna microarray hybridizations ; rt-pcr, values obtained by rt-pcr .

the dna microarray hybridization revealed  <dig> additional genes that were differentially expressed in the zur mutant c. glutamicum js <dig> . as most of the corresponding m-values were close to the detection limit of the dna microarray, expression of this gene set was furthermore examined by real-time rt-pcr. using this more sensitive detection method, the expression of nine genes turned out to be significantly up-regulated in the zur mutant . among several coding regions of unknown function, this gene set includes cg <dig> coding for a putative cobalt/zinc/cadmium efflux transporter and cg <dig>  encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. in conjunction with the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase, the ald protein is involved in the two-step utilization of ethanol as sole carbon and energy source by c. glutamicum  <cit> . as none of the genes is preceded by a candidate zur-binding site, differential expression in c. glutamicum js <dig> is most likely a secondary effect of the zur gene deletion.

 <dig> gene expression in c. glutamicum js <dig> was compared with that of the wild-type strain atcc  <dig>  array, m-values obtained by dna microarray hybridizations ; rt-pcr, values obtained by rt-pcr .

 <dig> abbreviation: n.s., no significant differences detected.

verification of differential gene expression and promoter mapping
to support the conclusion that zur is involved in transcriptional regulation of the potential target genes, control assays with a complemented c. glutamicum zur mutant were performed, thereby measuring the differential gene expression by rt-pcr. for this purpose, the zur gene was amplified by pcr and cloned into the c. glutamicum expression vector pec-xk99e, resulting in plasmid pec-xk99e_zur . first, the differential expression of potential zur target genes in c. glutamicum js <dig> was verified by real-time rt-pcr assays. as expected, the mrna levels of all genes were clearly enhanced in the zur mutant when compared with the wild-type strain , with the exception of the adha gene . additional rt-pcr assays with the complemented strain c. glutamicum js <dig>  showed that the expression of potential target genes was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type strain atcc  <dig> carrying the empty cloning vector pec-xk99e . these results clearly demonstrated that the observed deregulation of gene expression can be attributed to the defined deletion of the zur gene in c. glutamicum js <dig> 

to elucidate whether the detected candidate zur-binding motif is relevant for transcriptional regulation of the respective genes by zur, the transcription start sites were determined by 5' race-pcr . the mapped transcription sites were used to deduce thereof the respective promoter regions according to the corynebacterial consensus sequences for -  <dig> and -  <dig> regions  <cit> . the transcription start sites in front of cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> were identical to the adenine residue of the respective atg start codons, indicating the presence of so-called leaderless transcripts that were detected previously in c. glutamicum  <cit> . in all cases, the candidate zur-binding motif overlaps the deduced core promoter regions . due to the short intergenic region  between cg <dig> and cg <dig>  a single candidate zur-binding motif can be used to control the expression of the divergently oriented transcription units. the genetic organization of the cg0794-cg <dig> intergenic region  is more remarkable, as the motifs overlapping the -  <dig> region in front of cg <dig> or cg <dig> are both simultaneously located downstream of the -  <dig> region belonging to the other gene . these locations of the candidate zur-binding motifs are consistent with the positions of operators used by repressor proteins to exert negative transcriptional control of gene expression  <cit> . as the zur binding sites always overlap either the -  <dig> region or the entire - 10/-  <dig> region of its target promoters, zur binding can block the entry of the rna polymerase and thereby repress the transcription of the target genes. on the other hand, the candidate zur-binding motif detected in the adha gene region is located  <dig> nucleotides upstream of the mapped transcription start site  <cit> . these experimental data therefore indicated that five transcription units  are under negative transcriptional regulation by zur in c. glutamicum.

verification of zinc-dependent expression of the putative cg <dig> and cg <dig> operons
as the putative operons cg <dig> and cg <dig> are apparently under negative control by the zur protein in c. glutamicum, we investigated their zinc-dependent expression in vivo by using again the promoterless gfp reporter system. for this purpose, the mapped promoter regions were amplified by pcr and cloned into the promoter-probe vector pepr <dig>  the resulting plasmids pepr1_prom_cg <dig> and pepr1_prom_cg <dig>  were transferred into the c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> wild-type strain and into the zur mutant c. glutamicum js <dig> to detect differential gfp expression by real-time rt-pcr, using high, low and chelated zinc conditions in the growth medium . c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> carrying the empty cloning vector pepr <dig> served as reference for calculating the differential gene expression. in the wild-type strain, the cloned promoters are apparently repressed under high-zinc condition and are derepressed under zinc-depletion, i.e. low-zinc condition and during growth in the presence of the chelator n,n,n',n'-tetrakis--ethylenediamine . a similar deregulation of gene expression was detected in the zur mutant c. glutamicum js <dig>  irrespective of the presence or absence of zinc ions in the growth medium . these in vivo data suggested that the lack of zinc-dependent regulation of gene expression is caused by the absence of the zur protein in c. glutamicum js <dig>  furthermore, the data indicated that the zur protein is sensing zinc ions and that it binds to operator sequences in the presence of zinc, thus acting as a repressor of the cg <dig> and cg <dig> operons.

verification of predicted zur binding sites by in vitro dna band shift assays
to demonstrate experimentally the direct interaction of zur with the candidate zur-binding motifs detected in front of potential target genes, emsas were performed using fluorescein-labeled 40-mer oligonucleotides containing the 21-bp motif in the center of native genomic sequences . for this purpose, the c. glutamicum zur protein was tagged with streptavidin and purified by means of strep-tactin sepharose-packed columns . retardation of the respective double-stranded 40-mer dna fragments was observed when the purified zur protein and  <dig> μm zncl <dig> were added to the dna band shift assays . in the absence of zncl <dig> no in vitro interaction of the purified zur protein with the 40-mer dna fragments was detected. a 40-mer sequence representing a regulatory gene region with a lexa binding site located in front of cg <dig>  <cit>  served as additional negative control. likewise, zur did not interact in vitro with the 21-bp motif located upstream of the adha promoter region . furthermore, mutated versions of the 21-bp motifs were generated by introducing transitions . in these cases, the purified zur protein failed to shift the mutated dna sequences. on the other hand, transitions introduced into the dna segments flanking the 21-bp motifs did not affect the in vitro binding of zur . to better define the role of metals in the ability of zur to interact with its operators, emsas were performed in the presence of either  <dig> μm zncl <dig>  mgso <dig>  nicl <dig>  cuso <dig>  mnso <dig>  or feso <dig> using exemplarily the 21-bp motif located upstream of cg <dig> . these assays showed that the purified zur protein was able to interact with this dna fragment in vitro in the presence of either zinc or manganese ions. similar observations were reported from dna binding assays with zn-dependent regulators from m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and b. subtilis  <cit> . the four 21-bp motifs recognized by the purified zur protein in vitro were used to delineate their consensus sequence in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  which is highly similar to the furb  consensus binding site from m. tuberculosis that was defined experimentally by dnase i footprint analysis  <cit>  . in summary, these results demonstrated the specific interaction of the zur protein with the 21-bp operator motif in the presence of zinc, thereby negatively controlling the expression of nine genes belonging to the zur regulon in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> 

discussion
the zur gene encoding a zinc uptake regulator is conserved in genomes of actinobacteria
in the present study, we have examined the regulatory role of the c. glutamicum zur protein  in the direct transcriptional control of gene expression. zur was classified by protein domain pattern analysis as member of the zur subgroup of the fur protein family  <cit> . fur proteins form a ubiquitous group of metal-responsive transcription regulators in many diverse bacterial lineages  <cit> . comparative genomics revealed the presence of more than one fur homologue in most members of the taxonomic class actinobacteria whose genome sequences have been completely determined, indicating that a gene duplication event predated the appearance of the last common ancestor of the actinobacteria  <cit> . a corresponding evolutionary model suggested that the resulting paralogues maintained the main biochemical properties of the ancestor regulator, but became specialized for coordinating different metal ions  <cit> , including iron , manganese , nickel , and zinc   <cit> . an apparent gene loss event occurred in the common ancestor of the corynebacteria, as corynebacterium genomes do not contain the fura gene encoding a regulator for oxidative stress genes, but have the orthologous furb  genes  <cit> . accordingly, the zur gene product of c. glutamicum belongs to the small set of  <dig> transcription regulators that were detected in all hitherto sequenced corynebacterial genomes  <cit> . moreover, synteny analyses revealed a conserved chromosomal region surrounding the zur gene in corynebacteria and other actinobacteria, including mycobacterium, nocardia and rhodococcus species  <cit> . in these species, the zur gene is located downstream of another regulatory gene encoding a putative metal-sensing transcription regulator of the smtb/arsr protein family  <cit> . both regulators might be involved in controlling the balanced expression of genes involved in zinc uptake and metabolism in some actinobacteria  <cit> . in m. tuberculosis, the rv2358-furb operon is regulated by rv <dig>  <cit>  and functions as the regulatory interface between the control of zinc uptake and efflux  <cit> . at low zinc concentrations, rv <dig> negatively regulates expression of the zita gene for a zinc efflux system  <cit>  and the transcription of furb, thereby enabling the expression of furb-regulated genes, including genes for zinc uptake systems  <cit> . at high zinc concentrations, rv <dig> does not bind to the operator site in front of the rv2358-furb operon and, as a consequence, zinc uptake is prevented by the regulatory action of furb and an excess of zinc is pumped out of the cell. since the genomic localization and the transcriptional organization of the znr-zur operon in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> is similar to that of m. tuberculosis h37rv, the regulatory role of cg <dig>  might be similar to that of rv <dig>  i.e. both transcription regulators work together to optimally balance the zinc concentration in the c. glutamicum cell. to verify this conclusion, the target genes of znr and its zinc-dependent interaction with the corresponding regulatory dna sites have to be determined in c. glutamicum in future studies.

the set of genes differentially expressed in the zur-mutant c. glutamicum js <dig> partially overlaps with the ethanol stimulon of c. glutamicum
the combination of genome-wide transcriptional profiling by dna microarray hybridization and in vitro dna band shift assays clearly demonstrated that the c. glutamicum zur protein negatively controls the expression of five transcription units with genes that are involved in the zinc metabolism in this species. a comparison of the transcriptomes of the zur-deficient mutant c. glutamicum js <dig> and the wild-type strain c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> revealed  <dig> genes with increased expression in the zur mutant js <dig>  this gene set, representing the cellular response to zur-deficiency in c. glutamicum js <dig>  partially overlaps with a stimulon detected recently in c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> cells grown with ethanol as the sole carbon and energy source  <cit> . growth of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig> on ethanol was characterized by enhanced expression levels of  <dig> genes when compared with acetate- and glucose-grown cultures. the set of differentially expressed genes detected in both genome-wide profiling studies include:  cg <dig> to cg <dig> and cg <dig> to cg <dig> encoding putative abc-type uptake systems for zinc ions,  cg <dig> encoding acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and  cg <dig> encoding a putative flavoprotein. on the other hand, an enhanced expression of the zur regulon members cg <dig> and cg <dig> was not deteced during growth of c. glutamicum on ethanol. the genes for the putative zinc uptake systems showed the largest increase of mrna levels in ethanol-grown cells of c. glutamicum, which was explained by the higher demand of zinc due to its incorporation into the zinc-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase  of c. glutamicum  <cit> . a candidate zur-binding site was detected by cross-genome comparisons in the upstream region of adha , but the purified zur protein did not bind to a corresponding 40-mer dna sequence in vitro. in addition, the adha gene was not detected as differentially expressed in the zur-deficient mutant c. glutamicum js <dig>  therefore, our results did not provide any evidence that the candidate zur-binding site is involved in transcriptional regulation of adha gene expression. the integration of the detected regulatory interactions into the database coryneregnet  <cit>  revealed that the zur regulon forms a separate module in the transcriptional gene regulatory network model of c. glutamicum and is thus not linked to the currently known network supercluster  <cit> . whether an additional carbon source-dependent control of the zur regulon by any kind of coregulation or hierarchical interaction is established in c. glutamicum remains to be elucidated.

physiological function of genes belonging to the zur regulon of c. glutamicum
since the metal ions sensed by members of the fur protein family are considered, on the one hand, fundamental for bacterial growth and, on the other hand, toxic at elevated levels, a strict balance between metal ion uptake and efflux is essential for homeostasis  <cit> . the target genes of the c. glutamicum zur protein detected in this study include two putative abc-type transport systems , a putative secreted protein , a putative oxidoreductase , and a putative p-loop gtpase of the cog <dig> family  that may specifically bind zn2+ ions  <cit> . we also showed that zur binds to the predicted operator sequences located in the mapped promoter regions of the respective genes, which are therefore under direct negative transcriptional control. the deduced genetic organization of the cg0794-cg <dig> intergenic region and the common transcriptional control of both genes via two zur operator sites suggests a functional link between the respective proteins. since some experimentally characterized members of the cog <dig> protein family of p-loop gtpases are so-called metallochaperones, such as hypb from methanocaldococcus jannaschii  <cit>  and ureg from helicobacter pylori  <cit> , the c. glutamicum p-loop gtpase cg <dig> may also function  as a zinc-specific metallochaperone/insertase to enable the in vivo assembly of zinc-containing proteins under environmental conditions of zinc deficiency. furthermore, cg <dig> is similar to ycic, an abundant protein from b. subtilis postulated to function as a metallochaperone  <cit> . expression of ycic in b. subtilis occurs in a zinc-dependent manner that is exerted by the b. subtilis zur orthologue  <cit> . ycic-like proteins are often members of the zur regulons in proteobacteria and firmicutes and may be involved in the specific binding and allocation of zn2+ ions  <cit> . the cg <dig>  and cg <dig>  proteins of c. glutamicum belong to the troa superfamily of metal-binding proteins that are predicted to function as initial receptors in abc-type transport systems of metal ions  <cit> , supporting the view that both systems are involved in transport of divalent metal ions, such as zn2+. the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding zinc uptake systems by zur proteins seems to be common in actinobacteria, as the zur gene is located adjacent to znu operons in arthrobacter, leifsonia, acidothermus, nocardioides, streptomyces, thermobifida, and rubrobacter species  <cit> . likewise, genes encoding zinc abc-type transport systems are under transcriptional control by zur in streptococcus suis  <cit> , xanthomonas campestris  <cit>  and yersinia pestis  <cit> .

the transcriptional regulation of znu operons was characterized during genome-wide analyses of zinc-responsive regulators in m. tuberculosis h37rv and streptomyces coelicolor a <dig>  <cit> . the genes regulated by zurmtub encode three putative metal transporters, a group of ribosomal proteins and proteins belonging to the early secretory antigen target  <dig>  cluster and the esat-6/cfp- <dig>  family  <cit> . likewise, zurscoe controls the expression of znuacb, located upstream of zur and encoding a zinc uptake transporter, and of genes for paralogous forms of ribosomal proteins that are devoid of zinc-binding motifs and can therefore replace, during zinc deficiency, their zinc-binding counterparts that can serve as zinc storage forms  <cit> . three dna binding sites of zurscoe were determined by dnase i footprinting analysis, revealing the 7-1- <dig> inverted repeat tgaaaatgattttca as consensus sequence of potential operator sites  <cit> . this consensus sequence is similar to the central region of the 10-1- <dig> inverted repeat  detected in the c. glutamicum genome in the present study. likewise, dna protection assays were used to identify zur binding sites in the m. tuberculosis genome sequence  <cit> . the deduced 10-1- <dig> inverted repeat is also similar to the consensus sequence of zur binding sites detected in the genome of c. glutamicum. accordingly, the zur binding sites in actinobacteria are apparently represented by a conserved 21-bp palindromic sequence with a 1-bp non-palindromic center, as shown by the zur-binding motif sequence logo .

CONCLUSIONS
the combination of cross-genome comparison of shared regulatory sites and whole-genome expression profiling with dna microarrays allowed us to deduce the zur regulon of c. glutamicum atcc  <dig>  it consists of five transcription units covering nine genes and encoding the components of two potential znuacb zinc transporters, a putative secreted protein, a putative oxidoreductase, and a putative p-loop gtpase of the cog <dig> protein family. in vivo expression studies and in vitro dna band shift assays demonstrated that zur directly represses the expression of its target genes in a zinc-dependent manner. accordingly, the zur  protein is the key transcription regulator for genes involved in zinc homeostasis in c. glutamicum.
