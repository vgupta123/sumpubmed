BACKGROUND
nucleoside triphosphate  hydrolysis  <cit>  is an important enzymatic reaction in biology  <cit> . during this reaction, the triphosphate moiety is hydrolyzed into diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. the reaction requires the breaking of two stable bonds: the pγ–oβγ bond of the triphosphate and one o-h bond of the attacking water molecule . this makes ntps highly stable in water  <cit> . for example for atp in presence of magnesium at 70 °c and ph ~  <dig>  the hydrolysis reaction rate constant has been measured at a slow  <dig> − <dig> min- <dig>  which corresponds to a high free energy barrier of ~28 kcal mol− <dig>  <cit> . two types of mechanisms have been proposed for the hydrolysis of triphosphate:  <cit>  1) a concurrent mechanism, in which pγ–oβγ cleavage and o–h bond breaking are concerted . 2) a sequential mechanism, in which the pγ–oβγ bond breaks  before the oh− nucleophilic attack   <cit> . in vacuum, both mechanisms have similar high-energy barriers, respectively  <dig>  and  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> for concurrent and sequential reactions. ntpase enzymes accelerate the hydrolysis reaction by a factor of  <dig>  <cit> . to help understand the catalytic mechanism in ntpase enzymes, we are studying here the triphosphate substrate in vacuum, and investigate in particular how protonation of different phosphate groups affects the hydrolysis reaction.fig.  <dig> triphosphate hydrolysis. a unprotonated methyl triphosphate reactant. the three protonation sites  are labeled. the arrows show the electronic rearrangements of the concurrent reaction mechanism: concerted breaking of the pγ–oβγ bond and lysis of water wa. b product state. the magnesium mg2+ is hexa-coordinated by two oxygen atoms of the triphosphate and four water molecules

in the catalytic pocket of ntpase enzymes, many partial positive charges surround the triphosphate moiety of ntp. figure 2a shows, for example, the active site of myosin with atp bound in the catalytically competent conformation. the many hydrogen bonds donated by the nh moieties of the p-loop  to the triphosphate moiety are seen in all ntpase binding sites. the positive electrostatic environment is further enhanced by lys <dig> and h-bond donor asn <dig> . these lysine,  and aspargine  <cit>    residues are critical for the catalytic function of ntpases, as evidenced from kinetic and mutagenesis studies. to differentiate how interactions between this electrostatically positive environment and the three individual phosphate groups affects the hydrolytic mechanism and its energy barrier, we are studying here the effect of placing protons on triphosphate in vacuum, varying the number of such protons and their oxygen location on the triphosphate. this reveals that the location of the protons has a strong influence on the catalytic mechanism. we derive a simple set of chemical rules, which explain this effect and can be related to the catalytic strategy used by ntpases.

triphosphate tends to chelate mg2+ in solution, and in the enzymes, ntps are always found with one mg2+ complexed between the β- and γ-phosphates. therefore, it is important to study the triphosphate bound to mg2+,  <cit>  which should be fully coordinated. the pka value of the reaction  is  <dig>  at 25co in the absence of magnesium  <cit> . the presence of magnesium makes this pka drop by about  <dig> units   <cit> . this means that the mg/atp complex is fully deprotonated in water, and therefore easily binds as mg2+/atp4− to the enzymes. in the present study, only the triphosphate moiety of ntp is considered, using methyl triphosphate as a substrate analogue . five water molecules are present: one attacking  water wa placed apically relative to the γ-phosphate, and four water molecules complete the coordination shell of the mg2+. it can be seen in fig. 2b that the energy-optimized conformation of this complex in vacuum is very similar to the conformation of the corresponding moiety of ntp in the enzymes . protonation states with up to three protons on the triphosphate were considered: a single proton was placed on either triphosphate oxygen α, β or γ . in the doubly protonated triphosphate, two protons were placed on either the αβ-, αγ-, or βγ-oxygens. in the triply protonated case, the three protons are on oxygens α, β and γ . together with the un-protonated  case, a total of eight protonation states were investigated here. for each of these protonation states, it was attempted to obtain both a concurrent and a sequential reaction. using the am1/d quantum method, ,  <cit>  minimum energy paths  were computed for each reaction. the meps give a complete description of the process, in terms of both mechanism and rate limiting energy barrier, and yield a molecular movie of each hydrolysis reaction .

our results show that the mechanism of hydrolysis is very dependent on the location of the protons on the triphosphate: protonation of the α- and β-phosphate groups favors the sequential mechanism, whereas protonation on the γ-phosphate favors a concurrent reaction. this can be explained in terms of the charge shifts that occur during these different reaction mechanisms. overall, the lowest barriers are achieved with the sequential mechanism, which can be explained by the fact that the dissociated pγo3
− metaphosphate intermediate  is a better target for the subsequent attack by the lytic water wa than the –pγo4
2− group in the concurrent reaction . this is consistent with the catalytic mechanism in ntpases, which has been shown to proceed via a sequential reaction . the present results help to explain why the many h-bonds made by the p-loop to the α- and β-phosphates of the ntp favor such a sequential mechanism in ntpases.

RESULTS
reaction paths
to obtain one concurrent and one sequential reaction path for each of the eight protonation states mentioned above, initial constraints on the atomic coordinates were applied to channel the refinement of the minimum energy paths  into a corresponding valley of the potential energy surface. however, after all constraints are removed, it turns out that there are not  <dig> such meps. only  <dig> meps could be found on the respective potential energy landscapes:  <dig> concurrent mep  and  <dig> sequential meps . for the concurrent reaction, there is no mep on the energy landscape for protonation states α, β, and αβ, while for the sequential reaction, no mep could be found for single protonation on γ. the explanation for this is given below. the energy profiles along the  <dig> meps are shown in fig.  <dig>  in the following sections, the characteristics of these paths are presented, starting with the concurrent paths and continuing with the sequential paths. twelve molecular movies showing the conformational changes that occur during these meps are available as supplemental information.table  <dig> effect of protonation on the barrier Δeǂ of the concurrent reaction

concurrent paths
unprotonated case 
the energy profile of the concurrent mep obtained in absence of any protons on the triphosphate is plotted in fig. 3a. it has a rate-limiting barrier of 44 kcal mol− <dig> about half-way  along the mep. the structure of that transition state is shown in fig. 4a. the γ-phosphorus has a distance to the leaving oxygen oβγ  of  <dig>  Å and a distance to the oxygen of the attacking water wa equaling  <dig>  Å. these two short distances reflect the fact that the breaking of the pγ–oβγ bond is concerted with the formation of the oa–pγ bond characteristic for a concurrent mechanism. in molecular movie c <dig> , it can be seen that shortly before the transition state is reached, one of the two protons of water wa is transferred onto one of the oxygens of the γ-phosphate, which acts here as a “catalytic base”. the high-energy barrier is due to the fact that two strong bonds are being broken nearly simultaneously : the pγ–oβγ bond and the oa–h bond of water wa. moreover, the γ-phosphate group  formally bears two negative charges, which makes it a poor target for the nucleophilic attack by the oa–h− moiety of water wa. also, the tetrahedral geometry of the –opγo3
2− group does not allow for a close approach of the phosphorus by water wa.fig.  <dig> transition state in the concurrent reactions. a methyl triphosphate fully deprotonated , b γ-protonated , c αγ-protonated , d βγ-protonated  and e αβγ-protonated . see also caption of fig.  <dig>  coordination bonds to mg2+ are shown as dotted line. the four water molecules coordinating the mg2+ are not shown, but are present in the calculations. the distance from the pγ to the leaving and attacking oxygen atoms is indicated in Å




single protonation 
the energy profile of the concurrent mep obtained with one proton placed on the γ-phosphate is plotted in fig. 3b. the rate limiting energy barrier is  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig>  and its structure is shown in fig. 4b. in spite of the fact that this structure and the reaction  are very similar to the un-protonated concurrent case , adding a proton on the γ-phosphate significantly lowers  the activation barrier of concurrent hydrolysis. this can be explained by the fact that the protonated γ-phosphate  bears one less negative charge than the un-protonated –opγo3
2−, so that its repulsion with the partial negative charge on oxygen oa of water wa is diminished. in the cases of single protonation on either the α- or β-phosphates, it was not possible to isolate concurrent meps. in spite of using initial constraints, the meps always reverted to a sequential reaction .

double protonation 
the energy profiles of the concurrent reaction obtained with two protons placed on the αγ- or βγ-phosphates are plotted in fig. 3c. structurally, these reactions proceed  very similarly to the un-protonated and the γ-protonated concurrent cases. their transition state structures  are very similar to the other concurrent transition states . their energy barriers  are slightly higher  than the barrier of the singly protonated case. this may be explained by the fact that α- or β-protonation favors a dissociation of the γ-phosphate , which involves larger pγ-oβγ distances than those of the concurrent transition state for single γ-protonation. indeed, the pγ–oβγ distance is  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å for the αγ and βγ protonation, respectively, slightly larger than the  <dig>  Å for single γ-protonation . thus, adding α- or β-protons on the concurrent transition states raises the barrier relative to the singly γ-protonated triphosphate. for the same reason, double protonation on the αβ phosphates always resulted in a sequential mep, in spite of attempts to use initial constraints towards a concurrent reaction.

triple protonation 
the energy profile of the concurrent mep with triply  protonated triphosphate is plotted in fig. 3e. the transition state  has an even larger pγ–oβγ distance  than the αγ or βγ doubly protonated transition states . the unfavorable effect of the α and β protons on the concurrent energy barrier  is more than cumulative, since it is  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> higher than for single γ-protonation . additional file 6: movie c <dig> shows the structural changes during this reaction.

sequential paths
all concurrent meps described above have one high rate-limiting transition state , which belongs to the simultaneous breaking of the pγ-oβγ bond and attack of water wa . in contrast, sequential meps have two distinct transition states: the first one belongs to the breaking of the pγ-oβγ bond to form a planar metaphosphate  intermediate , followed by the second transition state which pertains to the breaking of water wa  and attack onto the pγo3
− molecule . the two corresponding saddle points were geometry-optimized for each sequential mep. their energies  are called here e <dig> and e <dig>  respectively for the first and second transition state . for the first transition state, the distances of the γ-phosphorus to the leaving and attacking oxygens are listed in table  <dig>  the structure of the 2nd transition state of each sequential mep is shown in fig.  <dig>  the metaphosphate intermediate state was also geometry optimized and its energy is called here e

single protonation 
the energy profiles of the sequential mep obtained with one proton placed on either the α- or the β-phosphate are plotted in fig. 3b. in both cases, the effect of these protonations on the barrier of the first step  is very strong, lowering Δe

ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig>  for β-protonation . such low barriers mean that the dissociation of the pγ–oβγ bond is nearly unhindered at room temperature when the triphosphate is protonated on the α- or β-positions, a remarkable result. moreover, the resulting metaphosphate intermediates are more stable than the reactant state .

how can protonation of the αβ-diphosphate moiety promote metaphosphate dissociation in such a dramatic way? the answer lies in the change of charge distribution upon dissociation: for example, in the un-protonated triphosphate reactant, two formal negative charges are located on the γ-phosphate  and two negative charges are on the αβ-diphosphate moiety . in the metaphosphate intermediate, the pγo3
− bears a single negative charge and the αβ-diphosphate has three negative charges . thus, one negative charge shifts from the γ- to the αβ-phosphates upon dissociation. this charge shift is strongly favored when a positive charge  is placed onto the αβ-moiety.

ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> for α- and Δe

ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> for β-protonation , which is similar to that of the un-protonated case . this indicates that the effect of these protonations on step  <dig> is limited, as would be expected from the fact that the αβ-moiety is no longer covalently bound to the γ-phosphate when the later gets attacked by water wa . note that it is difficult to compare the energy of the metaphosphate intermediate  of the α- and β-cases, due to the large conformational change that occurs  after metaphosphate formation in the β-case .

all attempts to obtain a sequential mep with one proton placed on the γ-phosphate failed, because the reaction always became concurrent. this effect can be explained in terms of the above mentioned charge shift: placing a positive charge  on the γ-phosphate strongly disfavors the shift of the negative charge from the γ- to the αβ-moiety  that needs to take place upon metaphosphate dissociation. therefore, placing a proton on the γ-phosphate destabilizes the metaphosphate so much, that the “transition state” of step  <dig> is no longer a saddle-point on the energy surface .

double protonation 
placing two protons on the αβ-moiety  favors the shift of negative charge from the γ- to αβ-phosphates even more than a single proton. not surprisingly, the barrier of metaphosphate dissociation drops even lower in this case, Δe

ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> . the corresponding energy profile is plotted in fig. 3d, where this barrier  can be seen to be so low that the first step is essentially barrier-less. after some rearrangements of the metaphosphate intermediate , the barrier of step  <dig>  is Δe
2
ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> , which is similar to the value obtained for single protonation on β  and confirms that protonation of the αβ-moiety does not significantly affect step  <dig> of the sequential reactions.

double protonation on the αγ- or βγ-phosphates has a very different effect than the double protonation of the αβ-moiety described above, as can be seen by comparing their three energy profiles . indeed, the resulting barrier for step  <dig> is Δe
1
ǂ =  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> for αγ-protonation, as high as for step  <dig> in the un-protonated case , and much higher than for the singly α-protonated case . thus, protonation on the γ-phosphate counteracts the promoting effect of α-protonation on the metaphosphate dissociation step. as described above, this is due to the unfavorable effect of the positive charge  on the γ-position, which opposes the charge shift from the γ- to the αβ-moieties, thereby suppressing the favorable effect of α-protonation. the same behavior happens for double protonation on βγ, for which Δe

the Δe

ǂ barrier of step  <dig>  is lower for the αγ- and βγ-cases,  <dig>  and  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> respectively , than for single protonation on α or β . the reason for this is the same as the one given above to explain barrier lowering in the concurrent singly γ-protonated case: the presence of a γ-proton leads to a dissociated metaphosphate in the neutral hpγo <dig> form . this generates less repulsive interactions with the partial negative charge on oxygen oa of water wa when it attacks this neutral metaphosphate in step  <dig>  thus, just as seen in the concurrent reactions, having a proton on the γ-phosphate facilitates the activation of water wa when it attacks the γ-phosphorus. additional file 11: movie s <dig> and additional file 12: movie s <dig> show the sequential αγ- and βγ-reactions, respectively.

discussion
principle effects of -protonation
the results obtained here for the different protonations of triphosphate can be explained by the four following principles:α- and/or β-protonation favor the sequential reaction

when a single or two protons are placed on the α- and/or β-positions, hydrolysis is found to occur only via the sequential mechanism. concurrent transition states can’t be located for protonation cases α, β or αβ. the energy barrier for pγ–oβγ bond breaking, Δe
1
ǂ, is considerably lower for protonation cases α, β  and αβ  than for the dissociation barrier of the un-protonated case , see fig. 6a. all this shows that pγ–oβγ bond dissociation is strongly favored when protons are added onto α or β positions. this is because α- and/or β-protonation favors the negative charge shift from the γ-phosphate to the α,β-diphosphate upon pγ–oβγ bond breaking : in un-protonated triphosphate, two formal negative charges reside on the αβ-diphosphate and two negative charges on the γ-phosphate. after pγ–oβγ bond cleavage, the αβ-diphosphate moiety bears three negative charges and the γ-metaphosphate has one negative charge. the positive charge of a proton placed either on an α or a β oxygen atom of triphosphate pulls the electron density away from the γ-phosphate group and towards the αβ-diphosphate moiety. this prepares for the electronic distribution of the dissociated metaphosphate state, thus explains the large reduction in the Δe

ǂ energy barrier. this stabilization effect is so strong that the resulting metaphosphate state constitutes a stable intermediate in the energy profile of all sequential reactions . the energy e
meta of this intermediate is lower than the reactant  for all cases of protonation on exclusively α- and/or β-groups . as is expected from the formal charge distribution of the dissociated state , this pulling effect on the electron-density towards the αβ-diphosphate is somewhat stronger for β-protonation than for α-protonation .fig.  <dig> effect of protonation on the two steps of the sequential mechanism. energy barriers a Δe

γ-protonation disfavors the sequential reaction

the effect of γ-protonation is the opposite of the effect of α/β-protonation and raises the Δe

ǂ energy barrier of pγ–oβγ bond cleavage. when a γ-proton is added to an α-protonated triphosphate, Δe
1
ǂ raises from  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> to  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> . a similar trend is observed when the γ-proton is added onto the β-protonated triphosphate , or when added to the αβ-protonated triphosphate , see fig. 6a. again, this disfavoring effect of γ-protonation on pγ–oβγ bond breaking is explained by the charge-shift during pγ–oβγ bond cleavage. the positive charge of the γ-proton hinders the shift of the negative charge from the γ-phosphate to the αβ-diphosphate , thus disfavoring dissociation and raising Δe
1
ǂ. this effect is strongest in absence of any protons on α and β. in that case, a single proton on γ-position even abolishes the sequential reaction .

conversely, γ-protonation is necessary to be able to observe a concurrent reaction at all. indeed, all concurrent paths with protonated triphosphate have a proton on the γ-phosphate . in absence of γ-proton, these meps all revert to the sequential mechanism. for example, there is no concurrent mep for singly α-protonated triphosphate, but a concurrent reaction can be found for the αγ-protonated case . the same effect is observed for adding a γ-proton to β-protonated triphosphate, or for adding a γ-proton to the αβ-protonated triphosphate. thus, adding a γ-proton alters the potential energy surface in such a way that the concurrent mechanism becomes feasible.

γ-protonation favors the breakup of water wa


for the sequential reactions, γ-protonation lowers the activation barrier Δe

ǂ of β-protonated methyl triphosphate  reduces to  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> upon addition of the γ-proton, and addition of the γ-proton to αβ-protonated triphosphate reduces the barrier from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kcal mol− <dig> . the reason for this effect is that γ-protonation yields a neutral metaphosphate intermediate of the form hpγo <dig>  it is not negatively charged , which reduces the electrostatic repulsion between the partial negative charge on oxygen oa of water wa and the γ-metaphosphate. therefore, the γ-protonated metaphosphate is a better target for nucleophilic attack by wa  than the un-protonated po3
−. the same effect is at work in the concurrent reactions, where all reactions for triphosphate with a γ-proton can be seen  to have a lower activation barrier Δe
ǂ than the un-protonated  case . thus, for both concurrent and sequential mechanisms, protonation in the γ-position lowers the energy barrier of water breakup and attack.

implications for triphosphate hydrolysis in enzymes
catalytic strategy
there are clear parallels between the hydrolytic reaction in enzymes and the αβγ-protonation case described above in terms of the resulting sequential mechanism and the respective energy barriers: the lowest barrier of hydrolysis in vacuum is obtained here when all three phosphates  of triphosphate are protonated, with a sequential mechanism . likewise, it has been shown recently for several ntpases  that they all have a catalytic mechanism that is sequential, involving the initial formation of a pγo3
− metaphosphate, followed by the attack of the lytic water . this similarity is not due to protonation of the phosphates in the enzyme ,  <cit>  but arises because interaction of each phosphate group with its positively charged protein environment promotes similar charge-shifts within the triphosphate as those described above for the protonation in vacuum. for example in myosin, the six hydrogen bonds of the p-loop are all made to the αβ-phosphates , thus pulling negative charge away from the pβ-oβγ bond. this is likely to have a similar lowering effect on the Δe
1
ǂ barrier as the charge shift induced by the protonation on the α and/or β phosphates . the three h-bonds donated to the γ-phosphate by the ser <dig> side chain and the backbone of ser <dig> and gly <dig>  make the γ-phosphorus become a better target for nucleophilic attack by water wa, probably contributing to the lowering of Δe
2
ǂ in the enzyme in a similar way as protonation of the γ-phosphates . a crude estimate of the amount of positive charge placed in direct contact with the triphosphate in myosin can be made: the nine h-bonds and lys185+ amount to approximately + <dig>  charges   <cit> . of course this number is not a true net charge , but it is close to the + <dig> charge of three protons distributed onto the α-, β- and γ-protonated triphosphate. thus it is not surprising that the Δe
1
ǂ barrier obtained for myosin  is nearly as low as the Δe
1
ǂ obtained with triply protonated triphosphate in vacuum .

in the present vacuum simulations, the proton abstracted from wa was transferred to the γ-phosphate . thus the γ-phosphate serves as both the proton acceptor and as the general base that activates water wa. in the enzymes, the final acceptor of the proton is also the dissociated γ-phosphate, but the ntpases utilize an external catalytic base  to activate water wa. this external base serves to polarize water wa, either directly  or via an intercalating helping water molecule . this allows the enzymes to further lower the barrier for lysis of water wa, and thus facilitate water attack onto the dissociated metaphosphate. in this way, the barrier for step  <dig> of the sequential reaction  can be lowered even more than can be achieved by only having partial positive charges interacting with the γ-phosphate group .

during step  <dig> of the present sequential pathways in vacuum, the proton abstracted from water wa is directly transferred onto the oxygen of the γ-phosphate. the corresponding transition state contains a 4-membered ring , which induces some strain. in the enzymes, this transfer occurs via either a helping water  and/or the alcohol group of a nearby serine side chain   <cit> . the resulting 6- or 8-membered ring in the transition state allows for less strain, thereby further lowering the barrier Δe
2
ǂ. together with the activation from an external base, this explains how the enzymes manage to bring Δe

in all combined quantum mechanical/classical  simulations of atp hydrolysis in myosin during which a proton had first transferred to the γ-phosphate, the mechanism has always been found to be concurrent, never sequential . this is consistent with the results obtained here: whenever the γ-phosphate is protonated, the pγ-oβγ bond is strengthened, preventing a sequential mechanism with prior breaking of the pγ-oβγ bond. conversely, in all those calculations in which the γ-phosphate was not protonated, the mechanism has been observed to be sequential  <cit> . similarly, in qm/mm simulations of the phosphoryl transfer reaction in bovine protein tyrosine phosphatase ,  <cit>  it was shown that the phosphoryl transfer occurs via a sequential mechanism with a  <dig> kcal mol− <dig> barrier when the leaving phosphate group is unprotonated  <cit> . in contrast, when the leaving phosphate group was protonated, phosphoryl transfer was seen to occur via a concurrent mechanism with a barrier of  <dig> kcal mol− <dig>  <cit> . this can be explained in the same terms as for the effect of γ-protonation on triphosphate hydrolysis: protonation of the terminal phosphate strengthens the p–o bond, and the p–o bond cleavage become concurrent, thus resulting in a higher barrier.

CONCLUSIONS
a clear set of rules for the effects of α-, β- or γ- protonation on triphosphate hydrolysis in vacuum can be identified. they are: 1) protonation of the α- or β-phosphate promotes pγ–oβγ bond cleavage, thus favoring a sequential reaction. 2) protonation on γ favors a concurrent reaction, thus disfavoring the sequential pathway. 3) γ-protonation facilitates the attack of water onto the γ-phosphorus. these effects are somewhat additive, so that simultaneous protonation on the γ- and α-  positions can result in both concurrent and sequential reactions. these rules can be explained in terms of the charge distribution on the phosphates: i) α- and/or β-protonation pulls electrons towards the α,β-diphosphate moiety, favoring the charge distribution of the dissociated state . ii) γ-protonation has the opposite effect, pulling electrons towards the γ-phosphate, favoring the un-dissociated charge distribution , thereby making dissociation less favorable. iii) γ-protonation reduces the negative charge of the γ-phosphate, which thus becomes a better target for the nucleophilic attack by water wa.

breaking-up a water molecule is very difficult, and is the rate-limiting step in all pathways. therefore, the sequential pathways tend to have a lower rate-limiting barrier than the concurrent reactions. one reason is that the energetic cost of breaking the pγ–oβγ bond  has already been paid in the previous step. the other reason is that the dissociated γ-phosphate  is planar and less negatively charged than the un-dissociated γ-phosphate , making the former a better target for the nucleophilic attack by water wa. for this reason, the lowest energy barrier of hydrolysis is obtained for the α,β,γ-protonated case, which combines all effects.

the present calculations are consistent with experimental studies: uncatalyzed phosphoryl transfer reaction from atp, gtp and pyrophosphate are suggestive that the beta-gamma-bridging oxygen atom undergoes significant charge-increase   <cit> . charge shift was also observed in the ras catalyzed hydrolysis of gtp in gap using time-resolved fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy  <cit> . in ntpases, the charge shifts are induced by placing many positive partial charges in direct contact with each of the three phosphate groups. additionally, the ntpases further lower the rate-limiting barrier of water lysis by placing a residue  nearby that acts as a better general base for water activation than the γ-phosphate. the present study helps to better understand the respective role of the many h-bond donors and positive charges in the active site of ntpases. depending on its placement, each of these groups contributes differently to the catalytic mechanism, according to the set of rules listed above. it is known that atp-γ-s is far more stable than atp,  <cit>  and is not easily hydrolyzed by enzymes  <cit> . an interesting computational study would be to compare the catalysis of atp-γ-s with that of atp.
