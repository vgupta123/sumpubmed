BACKGROUND
eukaryotic cells are defined by the presence of subcellular compartments termed organelles, the presence of which allows for the partitioning of various biochemical pathways out of the cytosolic environment. each organelle contains a specific complement of proteins that carry out specialised roles within the cellular landscape. however, while it was thought that specific proteins were only targeted to a single organelle, called location specific proteins, a large number of proteins have now been identified to be targeted to more than one organelle, and as such are termed dual targeted proteins. in plants, over  <dig> proteins have now been identified as dual targeted   <cit> , the majority of which are targeted to both mitochondria and plastids. however, in recent years dual targeting of proteins has also been shown to occur between a number of additional organelles including: mitochondria and peroxisomes  <cit> , plastids and peroxisomes  <cit> , plastids and nucleus  <cit> , plastids and endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> , mitochondria and nucleus  <cit> , cytoskeleton and peroxisomes  <cit> , mitochondria and the cytoplasm  <cit> , and plastids and the cytoplasm  <cit> .

mitochondrial respiration is an essential feature of plant metabolism, resulting in the generation of atp in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. in addition to the classical electron transport chain coupled to phosphorylation, plant mitochondria contain a non-phosphorylating pathway. a major constituent of this alternative pathway is the type ii or rotenone-insensitive nadh dehydrogenases . type ii nd proteins were first identified in potato  <cit>  and have also been identified in fungi, protists, some bacteria and some primitive animals  <cit> . the function of these type ii nd proteins is that when they are linked to an alternative oxidase  they constitute a non-phosphorylating respiratory pathway that enables the redox status of the cell to evade adenylate control  <cit> . specific studies altering the expression or inactivating the expression of specific type ii nd proteins suggest roles in the capacity of nadh oxidation   <cit> ; reactive oxygen species formation and altered phenotypes   <cit> .

the subcellular localisations of plant type ii nd proteins have been a topic of debate in recent years. initial in vivo gfp studies involving the targeting signals fused to gfp from five of the arabidopsis nd proteins identified all proteins to be located in mitochondria  <cit> . independent analyses using in vitro import assays into isolated mitochondria determined that three nd proteins  are externally located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and three were defined as internal   <cit> . the final protein, ndb <dig> could not be cloned, and was concluded to be a pseudogene  <cit> , although recent transcriptome analysis during germination suggests that ndb <dig> is expressed very early in germination  <cit> . however, subsequent studies have identified that arabidopsis nd proteins are in fact dual-targeted, nda <dig>  nda <dig> and ndb <dig> were found to be dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes  <cit> , and ndc <dig>  was determined to be targeted to mitochondria and plastids  <cit> . the different conclusions from these studies can be readily reconciled by the fact that initial studies only used c-terminal gfp tags with the first  <dig> to  <dig> n-terminal amino acids of the target proteins  <cit> . however to ensure that targeting signals are not deleted or blocked, both n- and c-terminal gfp tagging is necessary  <cit> . also with dual targeted proteins it appears that the mature or passenger protein can influence targeting to mitochondria and chloroplasts  <cit>  so full length coding sequences should be tested to determine full targeting ability  <cit> .

while desirable to use two or more complementing methods to determine subcellular localization  <cit> , this can be difficult with dual targeted proteins in a variety of plant systems, requiring isoform specific antibodies and high purity of organelles. these tools do not exist except for arabidopsis proteins and organelles. of the known dual targeted proteins in arabidopsis only  <dig> percent have been verified by  <dig> or more approaches . this number drops to  <dig> percent when we look at dual targeted proteins identified in both target organelles by proteomic techniques . by far the best and most widely used technique to discover dual targeted proteins has been fluorescent tagging . to date, no case of dual targeting using gfp tagging has been shown to be an artifact, in terms that while a false-negative rate may exist, due to the nature of the constructs as outlined above, false-positives have not been reported to date. furthermore when assessing targeting, prediction and phylogenetic comparisons provides additional avenues to assess targeting, and along with gfp tagging, can be used to determine targeting ability of proteins in a variety of plant species, where direct biochemical approaches with gene families are not feasible.

given that inactivation of specific nd genes in arabidopsis has led to altered phenotypes  <cit> , it is important to gain a wider perspective on the location of nd proteins in a variety of plants, as function can only be correctly determined if location is known. in order to gain a better insight into the targeting of plant type ii nd proteins a study was undertaken to determine the subcellular localisation of all nd proteins from oryza sativa  and physcomitrella patens , that spans  <dig> million years of plant evolution, thus in order to obtain a phylogenetic view of the dual targeting of nd proteins, subcellular localizations were analysed using gfp fusion proteins.

RESULTS
phylogenetic analyses and subcellular targeting predictions
previously, we had determined that a number of nd proteins from arabidopsis thaliana are dual targeted to several locations including: mitochondria and peroxisomes or mitochondria and plastids  <cit> . to gain a better understanding of how widespread this dual targeting ability is, we identified all the nd type proteins from a number of plant species, utilised various subcellular prediction programs for each ortholog and identified any peroxisomal type  <dig> targeting sequences  according to several prediction programs  <cit>  and the araperox database  <cit>  . phylogenetic analysis showed that all nd orthologs are clustered into three distinct clades . types a, b and c . it was found that a type nd proteins  are predominantly predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria and is consistent with the previous data from arabidopsis in which both nda <dig> and  <dig> have cleavable mitochondrial n-terminal targeting signals  <cit> . however, it was interesting that at least one nda ortholog from each higher plant species appears to have a pts <dig> signal at their c-terminus. none of the prediction programs used predicted peroxisomal targeting for any of the nda proteins from physcomitrella  or chlamydomonas .

amongst the ndb type proteins, prediction of mitochondrial targeting was less frequent . this may be due to the fact that ndb proteins do not contain a cleavable n-terminus mitochondrial targeting signal which is the basis of the prediction programs used  <cit> . however, the majority  of ndb proteins, ranging from physcomitrella to poplar also contain predicted pts <dig> sequences. it is interesting to note that the predicted pts <dig> sequences in both nda and ndb proteins are not conserved in all species. in fact, in different species the pts <dig> sequence is completely different in terms of the amino acids making up the last c-terminal tripeptide; however, the properties remain the same. this suggests that the c-terminal regions of nda and ndb proteins is not crucial for catalytic function. the ndc type proteins, so named for their similarity to a cyanobacterial nadh dehydrogenase, and are mostly predicted to be targeted to plastids  <cit>  . no pts <dig> sequences were predicted. this is consistent with the localisation of arabidopsis ndc <dig>  which is predicted to be plastidial but has been experimentally shown to be targeted to both mitochondria and plastids  <cit> .

subcellular targeting of nda proteins
it has previously been shown that both nda proteins from arabidopsis  are dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes by both gfp-tagging and western blot analysis  <cit> . to demonstrate the fluorescence patterns expected by a dual targeted protein containing an n-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal and a c-terminal pts <dig> sequence we have included the arabidopsis proteins in our analysis of the rice and physcomitrella nda orthologs. when gfp is placed at the c-terminus of both atnda <dig> and  <dig>  the chimeric protein is targeted to mitochondria in both arabidopsis cell suspension and onion epidermal cells  as visualized by the overlap of the gfp with the rfp signals from the mitochondrial controls. in most instances the gfp signal shows a halo-like shape around the mitochondria. this has been speculated to result when the gfp is not completely pulled into the mitochondria and has previously been observed with atnda and atndb proteins  <cit>  and is also observed with the gfp tagging of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins  <cit> . however in this case, as nda proteins are known to be located in the inner membrane, it is possible that the c-terminus of nda proteins are located in the intermembrane space  and may produce a similar result  <cit> . in contrast to the full-length c-terminal fusions, truncation of both atnda <dig> and atnda <dig> to just the final  <dig> amino acids fused to the c-terminus of gfp , was found to target solely to the peroxisomes . this co-localization was observed in both tissue types tested.

when both nda proteins from rice  were analysed in the same manner, slightly different results were obtained. osnda <dig> was observed to target to mitochondria when gfp was fused to its c-terminus , however when the last  <dig> amino acids are fused to the c-terminus of gfp, no targeting was observed to any distinct organelle , consistent with the fact that osnda <dig> does not contain a predicted pts <dig> signal. when the targeting of osnda <dig> was tested it was seen to target to both mitochondria and peroxisomes in both the tissues tested . therefore, at least one of the rice nda proteins displays dual targeting ability. to determine if dual targeting ability is also evident with physcomitrella nda <dig> and nda <dig>  the same set of experiments were performed. in both onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis cell suspension both physcomitrella nda proteins  displayed dual targeting ability to both mitochondria and peroxisomes  as with atnda <dig>  atnda <dig> and osnda <dig>  however, based on the bioinfomatic analysis the targeting of ppnda <dig> and ppnda <dig> to peroxisomes is surprising as they do not contain any pts <dig> signal nor are they predicted to be peroxisomal . to test whether this peroxisomal targeting is an artifact, we expressed the physcomitrella nda fusions in physcomitrella tissue, thereby eliminating any incorrect targeting arising from cross-species interference. again, both ppnda <dig> and ppnda <dig> were dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes , suggesting that the dual targeting of nda type proteins arose early in land plant evolution.

subcellular targeting of ndb proteins
the three arabidopsis ndb proteins  have previously been determined to be mitochondrial  <cit> , which was confirmed in this study . however, the last  <dig> amino acids of atndb <dig> fused to the c-terminus of gfp targeted to peroxisomes, whilst the last  <dig> amino acids of atndb <dig> and atndb <dig> did not target gfp to any distinct organelle and appeared cytosolic, indicative of no targeting . this confirms that atndb <dig> is dual targeted to both mitochondria and peroxisomes and that atndb <dig> and atndb <dig> can only be targeted to mitochondria. to determine if dual targeting of ndb proteins also occurs in rice, the two rice orthologs  were also analysed. both osndb <dig> and osndb <dig> were observed to target gfp to mitochondria and the last  <dig> amino acids can target gfp to peroxisomes in all the tissues tested . this suggests that the dual targeting of ndb proteins is conserved in rice and arabidopsis.

unlike rice and arabidopsis, physcomitrella contains three ndb homologs  and when gfp was fused to their c-termini, gfp was targeted to the mitochondria with a distinctive halo-like fluorescence in arabidopsis cell suspensions . however, when these same constructs were expressed in onion epidermal cells a very different picture emerged for ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig>  not only were ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> targeted to mitochondria but they could also target gfp to plastids . for ppndb <dig>  only mitochondrial targeting was observed . when the last  <dig> amino acids of ppndb <dig>  ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> were fused to the c-terminus of gfp, both ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> could target gfp to peroxisomes and ppndb <dig> showed targeting of gfp to the cytosol . the gfp assays were repeated with physcomitrella tissue  and as seen in the onion epidermal cells and arabidopsis cell suspensions both ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> were able to target gfp to mitochondria, plastids and peroxisomes . ppndb <dig> was only observed to target gfp to mitochondria, even in a homologous system . the lack of peroxisomal targeting by the c-termini of ppndb <dig> is not surprising, as no pts <dig> sequence is predicted . however, the targeting of ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> to plastids was unexpected. however, they are closely related to the chlamydomonas nda <dig> protein , which has been demonstrated to be a solely plastidic protein  <cit> . notably, physcomitrella ndb proteins are also considerably longer at the n-terminus compared to arabidopsis , suggesting additional targeting information and as the ambiguous targeting predictor  predicts both ppndb <dig> and ppndb <dig> to be dual targeted .

subcellular targeting of ndc proteins
phylogenetic analysis showed that among the three clades made up of nda, ndb and ndc proteins, ndc is the most ancestral group and branched out early in evolution. with regard to the targeting ability of ndc proteins, only one ortholog was found in arabidopsis, rice and physcomitrella. when arabidopsis ndc <dig>  was fused to gfp and expressed, two different patterns emerged. in arabidopsis cell suspensions a clear plastidic localization could be observed, however, in onion epidermal cells clear targeting to both mitochondria and plastids was observed . as atndc <dig> was previously shown to be imported into isolated arabidopsis mitochondria  <cit>  it can be concluded that atndc <dig> is dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids  <cit> .

to determine when dual targeting of ndc <dig> arose we analysed the targeting ability of rice  and physcomitrella . for osndc <dig> we see a similar pattern as with atndc <dig> in that plastid targeting was observed in arabidopsis cell suspensions and dual targeted to mitochondria and plastids in onion epidermal cells . for ppndc <dig> only plastid targeting was observed in both arabidopsis suspension and onion epidermal cells . gfp tagging of ppndc <dig> in physcomitrella tissue resulted in only plastid targeting . these results suggest that in lower plants such as physcomitrella, ndc <dig> proteins are only targeted to plastids, and in higher plants such as arabidopsis and rice ndc <dig> has additionally acquired targeting to mitochondria during plant evolution.

discussion
this aim of this study was to determine the targeting ability of plant nd proteins in land plants. aquatic green algae and land plants diverged over a billion years ago  <cit> . examination of genes encoding nd proteins in chlamydomonas revealed five genes. the closest nda ortholog between chlamydomonas and the higher plant nda proteins is crnda <dig> . crnda <dig> has been identified as an inner mitochondrial protein, with roles in the oxidation of the mitochondrial matrix nadh in the absence of complex i  <cit> . in this study, it was observed that both ppnda <dig> and ppnda <dig> are dual targeted to mitochondria and peroxisomes , indicating that the dual targeting of nda arose early in land plant evolution. although the tripeptide srf in ppnda <dig> and ppnda <dig> is not predicted to direct peroxisomal import , it has been experimentally validated as a plant pts <dig> tripeptide  <cit> . the contradiction of targeting between predictive and experimental data may be due to the fact that for non-canonical pts <dig> tripeptides targeting ability depends largely on the upstream sequence  <cit> . the reason of prediction inaccuracy for non-canonical pts <dig> proteins is that the proteins containing canonical pts <dig> tripeptides dominate the dataset, most of which lack upstream enhancing sequences for targeting  <cit> . in angiosperm plants such as arabidopsis and rice, dual targeting of nda proteins is not only conserved, but peroxisomal targeting is “strengthened” by the acquisition of canonical pts <dig> targeing signals. in atnda <dig>  atnda <dig> and osnda <dig>  all contain the pts <dig> tripeptide sri; a feature of many proteins known to target to the peroxisomes  <cit> . in summation, while the acquisition of dual targeting ability in land plants cannot be dated precisely, it arose early and is conserved.

the closest ndb ortholog between chlamydomonas and the higher plant ndb proteins is crnda <dig> ). it has been demonstrated that crnda <dig> was located within the thylakoid membranes of plastids and is crucial for nonphotochemical plastoquinone reduction and associated processes in chlamydomonas  <cit> . the plastid localisation is interesting, as physcomitrella ndb proteins  are also targeted to plastids , in addition to mitochondria and peroxisomes. it is speculated that the chlamydomonas and physcomitrella proteins are able to target plastids because they contain an n-terminal extension, in contrast to the arabidopsis and rice ndb proteins . this extension ranges from  <dig> amino acids in chlamydomonas and up to  <dig> amino acids in ppndb <dig> and ppndb2; which may carry extra targeting signals for plastids. in regards to the peroxisomal targeting of plant ndb proteins, it can also be hypothesized that this targeting ability arose very early in plant evolution. analysis of the c-terminal end of crnda <dig> while not predicted to be peroxisomal, it does contain the tripeptide srv which has been demonstrated to target peroxisomes previously  <cit> . however previous studies only used western blots on isolated plastids and mitochondria, and the testing of peroxisomes was not performed  <cit> . it is possible that even in chlamydomonas, ndb type proteins contained peroxisomal targeting ability. in terms of plastid targeting, this ability has been lost in the higher plants of arabidopsis and rice, possibly due to the loss of the n-terminal extension found in the chlamydomonas and physcomitrella sequences. a possible reason for this loss of plastid targeting is that in higher plants, plastids contain a type i nd which functions in non-photochemical plastoquinone reduction, however, such genes are absent from the genomes of many green algae including chlamydomonas  <cit> . the situation in physcomitrella would be the intermediate form, as physcomitrella contain both the type i and type ii nd proteins. this is consistent with plants starting out with only type ii nd proteins in plastids followed by the gain of type i nd proteins which would facilitate the loss of the type ii nd proteins. therefore the role of ndb like proteins in the plastids of higher plants has become redundant.

the evolutionary history for ndc type proteins appears simpler as each plant genome encodes only a single copy of the gene. however the targeting ability of these proteins across the different model plants is not the same. currently, there is no existing data on the targeting of chlamydomonas crnda <dig>  the closest homolog to ndc proteins in higher plants. recently, the role of atndc <dig> in plastids has been analysed. atndc <dig> was found to be involved in the reduction of a plastoquinone analog in vitro and affect the overall redox state of the total plastoquinone pool in vivo <cit> . atndc <dig> was also demonstrated to be required for normal platochromal- <dig> accumulation and is essential for viatmin k production  <cit> . atndc <dig> has also been found to associate with the plastoglobules within plastids  <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that ndc <dig> proteins perform these same functions in all plant species but as yet no functional data for the role of ndc <dig> protein outside of arabidopsis exists. however the fact that a ndc <dig> protein is found in all species analyzed  suggests that it does have a required function in plants. it appears that the targeting ability of ndc <dig> proteins and functional data for atndc <dig> support the hypothesis that the mitochondrial targeting of ndc <dig> proteins is a newly acquired phenomenon. however, the exact role for ndc <dig> proteins within the mitochondrial inner membrane has not yet been defined.

the dual targeting of plant nd proteins to mitochondria  and peroxisomes appears to have arisen early within the evolution of plants. we cannot at this time date this accurately, as we cannot rule out the possibility of the nda and ndb type proteins from chlamydomonas reinhardtii being targeted to peroxisomes. based on the results presented on the targeting of nd proteins to peroxisome from physcomitrella, the lack of a predicted pts <dig> sequence is not reliable enough to say that nd proteins are not targeted to peroxisomes. thus nd proteins from chlamydomonas reinhardtii may also be targeted to peroxisomes.

various studies have been undertaken to try and determine the cellular roles of type ii nd proteins in higher plants. by utilising over expression and inactivation of different nd proteins it has been demonstrated that nd proteins play roles in the capacity of nadh oxidation   <cit> , modulating the total leaf nadph/nadp + ratios   <cit> , reative oxygen species formation and salinity tolerance   <cit> . the functions of nd proteins have been proposed presuming an exclusive mitochondrial localization. however, as shown in this study, and other studies  <cit> , the targeting ability of a protein depends on the test tissue and the constructs used, and cell specificity cannot be ruled out, i.e. dual targeting may occur in specific types of cells. previous studies analyzing the location of ndb <dig> in potato tubers concluded that there was no ndb <dig> in peroxisomes  <cit> . this difference to this study may be due to several reasons, firstly, there is a difference between targeting and accumulation, and the specialized storage tissue of potato tubers may not be an ideal tissue to study the location of an enzyme, especially if stem/shoot phenotypes are being examined. secondly there are a number of technical problems with the methods used. the method used to purify the peroxisomes from the mitochondria  <cit> , is claimed to produce pure organelles with only 2% or less cross- contamination. however in both cases only catalase activity is used to verify organelle purity  <cit> . subsequent proteomic studies in yeast, mammalian and plant systems show that mitochondrial contamination is the most abundant contaminant of peroxisomes and vice versa  <cit> . also catalase is present in even highly purified mitochondria  <cit> . this suggests that the immunological approaches used in previous studies were not quantitative or sensitive enough  <cit> .

while various roles for nd protein in mitochondria and plastids have been ascribed as outlined above, no function has been described in peroxsiomes. type ii nd proteins are able to oxidize both nadh and nadph and both are produced in peroxisomes via isocitrate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. malate dehydrogenase and hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase can also produce nadh in plant peroxisomes  <cit> . while other enzymes can oxidise nadh and nadph in peroxisomes, this is also true for mitochondria and plastids, that have several systems to oxidise nadh or nadh  <cit> .

the nature of the acquisition of dual targeting to peroxisomes and mitochondria of plant nd proteins is unknown, but as it only requires the modification of the terminal  <dig> amino acids of a protein, it can be readily envisaged that it can occur. it can also be seen that not all the pts <dig> sequences are the same in the different nd proteins from different species . this indicates that the last three amino acids are not conserved due to functional constraints. this is supported by the crystal structure of the yeast type ii nd protein ndi <dig>  which illustrated that the c-terminal region is not required for enzymatic activity  <cit> . rather, the c-terminal region is required for attaching ndi <dig> to the inner mitochondrial membrane. this may mean that the c-terminal region of type ii nds may be able to readily undergo mutations which does not affect the catalytic activity of the protein. but may change the function as the protein is now targeted to an additional location, where it can carry out a new function.

the dual targeting of nd proteins in plants to mitochondria and peroxisomes is interesting because it involves two distinct targeting signals at opposite ends of the proteins. examples of this have been previously reported to occur naturally, in arabidopsis acyl-activating enzymes which display an identical arrangement of targeting signals except the mitochondrial signal is replaced with a chloroplast signal  <cit> , and an artificially created protein containing the chloroplast targeting signal of small subunit unit of rubisco  attached to both rfp and gfp followed by a pts <dig> signal, could in fact target to both chloroplasts and peroxisomes in vivo <cit> . this suggests that both signals can be recognized in the cell environment, even though the n-terminal signal would emerge from the ribosome before the c-terminal this differs slightly from previous work performed on the targeting signals of dual targeted proteins  <cit> . however these studies were focused on dual targeting between mitochondria and chloroplasts, where the targeting signals are both located at the n-terminus. thus regulation of import or binding factors may occur, to distribute dual targeted proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion this study shows that nd proteins are targeted to multiple organelles in land plants . we assessed targeting from three major groups of plants, dicots = arabidopsis, a moss = physcomitrella, and a monocot = rice, where we used allium . thus targeting was assesses for all three species that belonged to that major plant group. this multiple targeting ability arose early in the evolution of land plants. it is important that the understanding of the location of protein be taken from a wide variety of sources as possible. while models like arabidopsis have provided much information, it should not be presumed that all plants are the same with respects to the location of orthologous proteins. targeting signals of proteins are less constrained by specific sequence requirements than active sites of proteins, and therefore may be acquired and/or altered over time. while it is not feasible to interrogate the subcellular proteomes of a variety of plants species to the same degree as has been obtained in arabidopsis, discounting evolutionary differences would mean that all plants should be the same, and by definition that is not the case.
