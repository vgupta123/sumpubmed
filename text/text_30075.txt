BACKGROUND
eukaryotic initiation factor 5a  is a small protein ubiquitously present throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. the protein was initially identified in rabbit reticulocytes as a factor involved in formation of the first peptide bond 
 <cit> . eif5a is a highly conserved protein and contains the post-translationally synthesized amino acid hypusine 
 <cit> . molecular and biochemical studies in yeast and mammalian cells demonstrated that eif5a is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is activated by a post-translational hypusine modification that is only detected in the eif5a protein, and consists of a two-step sequential reaction catalyzed by deoxyhypusine synthase  and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase  
 <cit> .

the precise cellular function of eif5a is not fully understood. it was originally considered to be a translation initiation factor as it can stimulate methionyl-puromycin synthesis in vitro and transiently attach to ribosomes to begin eukaryotic cellular protein synthesis. in addition, eif5a promotes the formation of the first peptide bond at the initiation of protein synthesis 
 <cit> . recent studies have demonstrated that eif5a dysfunction significantly decreases protein synthesis in yeast, and that eif5a promotes translation elongation in saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> . henderson and hershey found that although eif5a is not required for protein synthesis, eif5a can stimulate the process by about 2- to 3-fold. they further draw a conclusion that the polysome profiles observe during and after eif5a depletion are diagnostic for a role in initiation 
 <cit> . in addition, eif5a is involved in cellular proliferation and apoptosis 
 <cit> , promotes cell viability and cell growth 
 <cit>  and the synthesis of proteins involved in progression of the cell cycle 
 <cit> . moreover, eif5a proteins are found to facilitate protein synthesis by participating in the nuclear export of specific mrnas 
 <cit> . furthermore, eif5a proteins also play a role in rna binding, and contain a c-terminal domain with a structure that resembles an oligonucleotide-binding fold 
 <cit> .

plant eif5a proteins are also highly conserved that are involved in multiple biological processes, including protein synthesis regulation, translation elongation, mrna turnover and decay, cell proliferation, leaf and root growth, seed yield, leaf, flower and fruit senescence and programmed cell death 
 <cit> . ma et al. showed that eif5a plays roles in supporting plant growth and in regulating responses to sub-lethal osmotic and nutrient stress 
 <cit> . valentini et al. showed that eif5a is involved in the wsc/pkc <dig> signaling pathway that controls cell wall integrity or related processes, and plays a role in cell wall formation 
 <cit> . hopkins et al. reported that eif5a plays a vital role in signal transduction pathways involved in pathogen-induced cell death and in the development of plant disease symptoms. plant eif5a genes are also involved in abiotic stress responses 
 <cit> . for instance, xu et al. showed that transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing rceif5a show improved resistance to heat, oxidative and osmotic stresses, while the plants with reduced eif5a expression  are more susceptible to these stresses 
 <cit> . chou et al. reported that salt and heavy metal stresses induce the expression of rice eif5a genes, oseif5a- <dig> and oseif5a- <dig>  suggesting that they are involved in stress tolerance 
 <cit> .

however, little is known of the upstream regulators or its regulatory network, and its role in stress tolerance. in addition, if eif5a does in fact confer stress tolerance in plants, the physiological changes mediated by eif5a deserve further study.

tamarix  species, which include small trees or shrubs, are widely distributed in the saline soils of drought-stricken areas of central asia and china. tamarix androssowii litvinov is highly tolerant to abiotic stresses, such as salinity, drought and high temperatures. these characteristics make the species a suitable source of stress tolerance genes and for investigating endogenous stress resistance mechanisms.

in the present study, we cloned and functionally characterized an eif5a from t. androssowii. we showed that taeif5a <dig> is a stress-responsive gene involved in the aba signal transduction pathway. tawrky and tarav can active the expression of taeif5a <dig>  in addition, taeif5a <dig> facilitates protein synthesis and regulates several physiological pathways to improve stress tolerance. this study reveals a physiological role for eif5a and defines a possible mechanism for eif5a-mediated stress tolerance in plants.

RESULTS
cloning and analysis of taeif5a <dig> and its promoter
the taeif5a <dig> gene , 801 bp in length and encoding a  <dig> aa protein with a predicted molecular weight of  <dig>  kda, was cloned from a t. androssowii. to investigate the homology of known eif5a proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed , which showed that taeif5a <dig> is most similar to the eif5a from manihot esculenta and has a long evolutional distance from eif5as of yeast and mammalian. however, there is little published information about the biological functions of these eif5a proteins and their molecular functions await further study.

the promoter of taeif5a <dig> was cloned using tail-pcr, and a promoter fragment with 1486 bp  in length was obtained. we identified diverse cis-elements in the promoter, including arr1at, dofcorezm, myb1at, mybcore and w-box  using place  
 <cit> . the w-box sequence “ctgact” was identified in taeif5a <dig> promoter that shows high binding affinity to wrky 
 <cit> .

expression of the taeif5a <dig> gene
real-time rt-pcr showed that taeif5a <dig> can be detected in roots, stem and leaves, and is differentially regulated by different abiotic stresses. the expression of taeif5a <dig> was induced in roots by salt stress at  <dig> or 24 h, but not at other time points. in stems, taeif5a <dig> was down-regulated after  <dig> and 72 h of nacl stress. moreover, taeif5a <dig> was strongly down-regulated in leaves after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h of nacl stress, but its expression was unaffected at other time points . the taeif5a <dig> was down-regulated in roots, stems and leaves following exposure to peg stress for 24–72 h . interestingly, taeif5a <dig> exhibited the same expression pattern in roots, stems, and leaves under nahco <dig> stress, being up-regulated after  <dig>   <dig> and 72 h of stress and down-regulated at all other time points . following cdcl <dig> stress, taeif5a <dig> was generally down-regulated in roots, stems and leaves . aba treatment induced a marked inhibition of taeif5a <dig> expression in roots, stems and leaves by 6 h, followed by recovery thereafter .

to further investigate the promoter activity of taeif5a <dig>  the transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing gus under the control of taeif5a <dig> promoter were analyzed using gus staining . in young arabidopsis , gus activity was mainly confined to the cotyledons, the main root, the leaf tips, the tips of leaf teeth, veins and hydathodes . gus activity was present throughout the whole plant in five-week-old plants, and showed a step-wise reduction in both expression area and level in three-week-old and four-week-old plants . further, changes in gus expression pattern were observed during the development of the reproductive organs . in flowers, high gus expression was predominantly observed in the pistils, stigma, stamens, anther and petals, but not in the sepals . in the siliques, gus activity was present in the adhesion zones . consistent with real-time pcr results , these results indicated that taeif5a <dig> is expressed in all the tissues including leaves, roots, stems at all growth stages and reproductive organs.

targeting taeif5a <dig> to nucleus and cytoplasm
the subcellular localization of taeif5a <dig> was determined using the taeif5a1::gfp fusion gene under the control of the camv 35s promoter. the taeif5a1::gfp fusion gene and gfp control were transformed into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. we detected the green fluorescent signal of taeif5a1–gfp in the nucleus and uniformly distributed throughout transformed cells , suggesting that the taeif5a <dig> protein showed nuclear and cytoplasm localization.

analysis of the upstream regulator of taeif5a1
a w-box element was found in the taeif5a <dig> promoter, suggesting that taeif5a <dig> may be regulated by transcription factors that interact with w-box motif. to investigate the upstream regulator of taeif5a <dig>  yeast one-hybrid assay was performed using the phis2-cis  reporter vector as bait to screen a tamarix cdna library. in total, two genes were found to specifically bind the w-box motif : wrky transcription factor  and ap2/erf and b <dig> domain-containing transcription factor .

to characterize the specific interaction between the w-box and tawrky and tarav, we mutated the core w-box motif “tgac” to “tggc”, “taac” and “tttt”. both tawrky and tarav could bind the w-box motif, but they failed to bind to each of the mutants , indicating that both “g” and “a” in “tgac” are necessary for w-box recognition. these results indicate that tawrky and tarav can specifically bind to the w-box.

to further investigate whether these two genes can activate the expression of taeif5a <dig>  promoter fragments of  <dig> and 165 bp in length containing the w-box motif, and promoter fragment of 165 bp in length containing mutated core sequence “tttt” were respectively inserted into phis <dig>  and the interactions between these promoter fragments and the two genes were determined using the yeast one-hybrid system. we found that both tawrky and tarav can specifically bind to the two promoter fragments containing the w-box, but failed in binding to the promoter fragment containing the mutated core sequence “tttt” and the control  , indicating that they may regulate the expression of taeif5a <dig> through binding to the w-box motif in the promoter of taeif5a <dig> 

to further confirm the above interactions, we co-transformed the effector constructs  in which tarva or tawrky is driven by 35s promoter and their corresponding reporter plasmids  into tobacco leaves. histochemical staining and gus activity assay showed that the gus gene was activated in tobacco cells when co-transformation of prokii-tarva or prokii-tawrky with pcam-w-box and pcam-w165; however co-transformation of prokii-tarva or prokii-tawrky with pcam-mw <dig> failed in gus activation . these data clearly indicated that both tarva and tawrky can activate expression of taeif5a <dig> by binding to w-box motif in its promoter.

the expression patterns of tarav, tawrky and taeif5a <dig> were investigated using real-time rt-pcr. we found that both the expression of tarav and tawrky are induced by osmotic stress and negatively regulated by aba treatment, suggesting that tarav and tawrky are stress response genes and involved in aba signaling pathway. moreover, tarav, tawrky and taeif5a <dig> all share very similar expression patterns under different stress conditions .

given the facts that tarav and tawrky can activate the expression of taeif5a <dig>  we next studied if this mechanism of transcriptional regulation is also maintained in the model plant arabidopsis. using blastx program in tair, we identified the homologs of taeif5a <dig>  tarav and tawrky in arabidopsis are at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig>  respectively. real time rt-pcr showed that as in t. androssowii, at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> also shared a very similar expression patterns in arabidopsis when exposed to aba and osmotic stress .

functional analysis of the taeif5a <dig> gene using a s. cerevisiae expression system
yeast transformants harboring taeif5a <dig> or the empty pyes <dig> vector were generated to investigate the role of taeif5a <dig> in stress tolerance. rna gel blot showed that taeif5a <dig> can be induced in yeast cells, and reached a peak of expression after induction for 36 h . therefore, 36 h was selected as a suitable induction time. yeast transformants harboring taeif5a <dig> or empty vector were grown on induction medium for 36 h, and then treated with different stress-inducing agents. yeast cells expressing taeif5a <dig> exhibited better growth than control did under nacl, kcl, licl and sorbitol stress conditions , suggesting that expression of taeif5a <dig> in yeast increases tolerance to abiotic stresses.

we next compared the soluble protein content in three yeast transformants harboring taeif5a <dig>  taprx <dig>  or empty pyes <dig> . the protein content of yeast transformants harboring taeif5a <dig> was the highest, followed by transformants harboring taprx <dig> then empty vector . transformants harboring empty pyes <dig> failed to produce an exogenous gene and exhibited the lowest overall protein expression; the two other transformed strains expressed greater levels of protein, suggesting that the exogenous genes had been expressed. yeast transformants harboring taeif5a <dig> displayed significantly  higher overall protein levels than those harboring taprx <dig>  indicating that the taeif5a <dig> expression increases protein level in yeast cells.

overexpression of taeif5a <dig> improves salt tolerance in transgenic plants
to investigate whether overexpression of taeif5a <dig> in plants enhances stress tolerance, transgenic poplar plants expressing the taeif5a <dig> were generated. dna and rna gel blot analyses were conducted to confirm the integration and expression of exogenous taeif5a <dig> in transgenic plants . salt tolerance test on tube seedlings showed that there was no difference in height growth under normal growth conditions. however, under salt stress conditions, many transgenic lines exhibited significantly increased height growth relative to wt plants . in addition, salt tolerance test on plantlets in soil indicated that all the transgenic lines except line  <dig> displayed significantly improved height and basal diameter growth than control did . all these results suggested that salt tolerance of the transgenic lines was improved due to the overexpression of taeif5a <dig> 

additional abiotic stress tolerance assays
transgenic and wt plantlets were treated with cuso <dig>  cdcl <dig> and zncl <dig> or sorbitol for  <dig> d, and then their growth was compared. we found no difference in growth height between wt and transgenic plants under normal growing condition. however, relative to the wt, the transgenic plants exhibited greatly increased height growth under the various stress conditions , indicating that plants overexpressing taeif5a <dig> possess increased tolerance to these forms of abiotic stresses.

measurement of soluble protein content
prior to salt stress, soluble protein levels in transgenic plants did not significantly differ from those of wt plants. however, after  <dig> d and  <dig> d of salt stress, all transgenic lines contained significantly  higher levels of soluble protein than wt plants , indicating that overexpression of taeif5a <dig> greatly increases soluble protein levels in transgenic plants under salt stress conditions compared to wt plants.

pod activity assay
transgenic and wt plants had similar pod activity prior to salt stress. under salt stress conditions, pod activity in wt plants was transiently elevated after  <dig> d of stress, and subsequently recovered. however, in all transgenic plants pod activity was markedly improved and was significantly  higher than that in the wt during the entire 4– <dig> d period of exposure to stress conditions .

sod activity comparison
sod activity in the transgenic lines was either higher or lower than that of wt plants prior to salt stress . under salt stress conditions, sod activity in wt plants did not change; however sod activity was increased in transgenic lines, being significantly  higher after  <dig> and  <dig> d of exposure to salt stress , indicating that taeif5a <dig> overexpression specifically increases sod activity under salt stress condition.

electrolyte leakage assay
electrolyte leakage was not significantly different  between transgenic and wt plants prior to stress. electrolyte leakage increased in both transgenic and wt plants under stress conditions, with maximal electrolyte leakage levels after  <dig> d of salt stress. however, the increase of electrolyte leakage in transgenic lines was significantly lower than in wt plants . these results indicated that transgenic plants suffer less membrane damage under salt stress conditions compared to wt plants.

relative chlorophyll content  comparison
the rcc of wt plants did not notably vary following exposure to salt stress for 1– <dig> d, but markedly decreased after  <dig> d of exposure to stress. however, the rcc in transgenic plants increased over 4– <dig> d, and reached significantly  higher levels than that of wt control plants under stress for 7– <dig> d , indicating that taeif5a <dig> overexpression may enhance chlorophyll levels and prevent chlorophyll loss under salt stress condition.

discussion
taeif5a <dig> is expressed in all tissues of plants, and tolerant to different abiotic stresses
in the present study, we found that the taeif5a <dig> gene was significantly differentially regulated by nacl, nahco <dig>  peg and cdcl <dig> treatments , suggesting roles in the abiotic stress response. in addition, the expression of taeif5a <dig> and its upstream regulators, tarav and tawrky, were strongly inhibited by aba , suggesting that they are involved in aba-dependent signaling pathway. moreover, both yeast transformants and transgenic plants expressing taeif5a <dig> displayed increased tolerance to nacl, kcl, zncl <dig>  cuso <dig>  cdcl <dig> and sorbitol stresses. furthermore, taeif5a <dig> gene is expressed in all the tissues including leaves, roots and stem at different growth stages, and also in reproductive organs ; therefore they may play role of stress tolerance in all of these tissues of plants.

the w-box motif “ctgact” can be specifically recognized by tarav and tawrky
rav transcription factors contain an ap2/erf domain in their n-terminal regions and a b <dig> domain in their c-termini. some rav genes can interact with the sequences “caaca”, “cacctg” and the gcc-box “agccgcc” 
 <cit> , which are involved in plant defense pathways 
 <cit>  and diverse bioprocesses such as flowering, germination and the early events of leaf senescence 
 <cit> . in the present study, a rva gene, tarva, was found to bind to the w-box motif “ctgact” , and the binding is lost following “g” to “a” or “a” to “g” mutation of core “tgac” motif , suggesting a specific interaction.

wrky genes play a variety of roles in plant developmental and physiological processes. previous studies showed that most wrky proteins can bind to the cognate cis-acting element “c/ttgact/c” in the promoter or the 5’ untranslated regions of target genes 
 <cit> . our results showed that a wrky homolog  can specifically bind to the w-box motif “ctgact” and that the core “tgac” motif is sufficient for binding .

the expression of taeif5a <dig> is likely regulated by tawrky and tarav both of which can bind to the w-box
a w-box motif is present in the taeif5a <dig> promoter, indicating that it may be regulated by w-box-binding transcription factors. both yeast one-hybrid analysis and co-expression of reporter and effector genes demonstrated that two proteins, tawrky and tarav, which can specially bind to taeif5a <dig> promoter fragments containing the w-box, but failed in binding to the same fragments containing the mutated core sequence “tttt” . these results clearly suggested that both tawrky and tarav can activate the expression of taeif5a <dig> by binding to the w-box motif present in the promoter of taeif5a <dig>  moreover, the expression of taeif5a <dig>  tawrky and tarav share very similar expression patterns, are all inhibited following aba treatment and induced by osmotic stress , suggesting that taeif5a <dig>  tawrky and tarav may be components of a single regulatory pathway. therefore, these combined results strongly suggest that tawrky and tarav are the upstream regulators of taeif5a <dig> that can regulate the expression of taeif5a <dig> through binding to the w-box motif in the taeif5a <dig> promoter. in arabidopsis, the homologs of taeif5a <dig>  at1g <dig>  also has three w-box motifs in its promoter , suggesting that it may also be regulated by rav and wrky. interestingly, real time rt-pcr results showed that the at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> all shared very similar expression profiles in response to aba and osmotic stress , implying that these genes may also be components of a single regulatory pathway. these results indicated that the rav and wrky activate the expression of eif5a may be a conserved mechanism of transcriptional regulation, which is also maintained in the model plant arabidopsis.

taeif5a <dig> facilitates protein synthesis to improve stress tolerance
in the present study, we introduced taeif5a <dig> into yeast s. cerevisiae and poplar to investigate the role of taeif5a <dig> in protein synthesis. we found that overall protein levels in s. cerevisiae and poplar expressing exogenous taeif5a <dig> significantly improved compared with controls . these results suggest that taeif5a <dig> facilitates protein synthesis. in plants, protein synthesis is highly sensitive to salt stress and overexpression of eif1a can improve protein translation under stress conditions 
 <cit> . increased salt tolerance is observed in plants transformed with eif1a, indicating that protein synthesis positively correlates with stress tolerance 
 <cit> . in addition, protein accumulation provides a stored form of nitrogen that can be utilized to adjust osmotic potential 
 <cit> , suggesting that a vital component of stress tolerance is the maintenance and enhancement of protein synthesis under stress conditions. therefore, soluble protein levels may be closely associated with plant abiotic stress tolerance. these facts suggested that overexpression of taeif5a <dig> improves both protein levels and stress tolerance supports this hypothesis.

taeif5a <dig> regulates some physiological pathways to improve stress tolerance
abiotic stresses, including salt, drought and extreme temperatures, can induce the rapid generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species  that cause secondary oxidative stress to plants. therefore, improving the ros scavenging capacity is vital for plants to resist abiotic stress conditions. both pod and sod are important ros scavenging enzymes integral to plant stress tolerance. in the present study, two results must be considered together: transgenic taeif5a <dig> lines had significantly higher pod and sod activity than wt plants ; and transgenic taeif5a <dig> lines exhibited elevated protein synthesis  under stress conditions. consequently, we hypothesize that taeif5a <dig> increases sod and pod activity by elevating pod and sod enzyme synthesis and/or the synthesis of related proteins. in addition, elevated pod and sod activity may enhance the ros scavenging capacity of plants under salt stress. moreover, abiotic stresses in plants also typically result in cell membrane damage, leading to electrolyte leakage. therefore, electrolyte leakage is a common indicator of membrane damage and leakage is closely related to a loss in water potential. our results indicate that the level of electrolyte leakage in wt plants is significantly higher than in transgenic plants . these results suggested that taeif5a <dig> may also serve a role in membrane protection under stress conditions.

chlorophyll is the green plant pigment that absorbs light energy vital for photosynthesis. salinity causes a reduction in chlorophyll levels and inhibits the net photosynthetic rate. thus, chlorophyll content is a good indicator of the photosynthetic function of plants under adverse environmental conditions. previous studies have shown that rcc in trees is reduced by aggravated salt stress due to the degradation of enzymatic chlorophyll 
 <cit> . we found that the rcc in wt and taeif5a1-transformed plants was similar under normal conditions. however, taeif5a1-transformed plants displayed an increased rcc following stress, and rcc was significantly higher in transgenic relative to wt plants following 4–14 days of stress . these results suggest that eif5a also has a role in preventing chlorophyll loss under salt stress. the increased rcc indicates that taeif5a1-transformed plants should increase or maintain a stable photosynthetic rate under salt stress compared to wt plants. a previous study showed that rceif5a confers tolerance to heat, oxidative and osmotic stress, and overexpression of rceif5a can enhance sod activity and proline level, and decrease electrolyte leakage 
 <cit> . in the present study, we further showed that taeif5a <dig> is also tolerant to salt and heavy metal stresses, and overexpression of taeif5a <dig> can not only enhance sod activity and decrease electrolyte leakage, but also facilitate protein synthesis, increase pod activities and maintain higher chlorophyll content under salt stress. these results suggested that eif5a is involved in eliciting a stress response mechanism that may play a common role in plant tolerance to salt, heat, oxidative, osmotic and heavy metal stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, taeif5a <dig> is a stress responsive gene that forms part of the aba signal transduction pathway. the expression of taeif5a <dig> is likely regulated by the transcription factor tawrky and tarav both of which can bind to w-box “ctgact”. furthermore, taeif5a <dig> can facilitate protein synthesis and confer abiotic stress tolerance. we propose that taeif5a <dig> increases plant salt tolerance via several physiological pathways, including enhancement of protein synthesis, elevation of sod and pod activity, increase or maintenance of photosynthetic rates and the protection of cell membranes. therefore, eif5a serves essential and multiple roles in the reduction and elimination of stress imposed on plants by various abiotic factors.
