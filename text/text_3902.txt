BACKGROUND
carotenoids are hydrophobic c <dig> isoprenoid pigments occurring throughout the natural world. in higher plants carotenoids are typically associated with photosynthetic membranes of plastids, especially the chloroplasts where they are involved in a number of photochemical reactions. in chloroplasts carotenoids primarily act as accessory pigments in the light harvesting antennae complexes and also assist in photoprotection by quenching free radicals and preventing photo-oxidative damage to the cell. the carotenoids in chloroplasts are typically not found “free” within the aqueous stroma, but rather bound in distinct pigment-protein antenna complexes within the membranes of the thylakoids   <cit> .

the localisation and composition of carotenoids change during stresses , and during plastid transitions/differentiation: chloroplasts to chromoplasts  or chloroplasts to gerontoplasts   <cit> . the genes and enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in plants have received much attention and the conserved pathway is relatively well characterised ; similarly the genes and enzymes of the carotenoid metabolic pathway for v. vinifera have been described previously  <cit> .

the carotenoid cleavage dioxgenase  enzyme family contribute to the directed enzymatic production of apocarotenoids. apocarotenoids and their derived metabolites have diverse biological roles . in arabidopsis thaliana nine different ccds have been identified  <cit> . five of the arabidopsis ccds  catalyse the first step towards abscisic acid  biosynthesis  <cit> . the remaining four arabidopsis members of this protein family  have more divergent activities and catalyse the cleavage of a variety of carotenoid substrates at specific double bond positions. sequential cleavage catalysed by ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> are involved in formation of the shoot-branching inhibiting hormone, strigolactone  <cit> . ccd1- and ccd4-catalysed cleavage results in the production of a variety of flavour and aroma compounds  <cit> .

the ccd <dig> orthologues are highly similar and are the only members of the ccd enzyme family predicted to have a cytosolic  localisation  <cit> . orthologues have been shown to catalyse the symmetrical cleavage of a variety of carotenoids in vitro at the  <dig>   and  <dig>   double bond position producing a wide range of volatile c13-norisoprenoids. these carotenoid-derived c13-norisoprenoids are found in flowers, fruits, and leaves of many plants  <cit>  and are considered to be flavour and aroma compounds, often displaying very low detection thresholds. due to their contribution to the fruity and floral varietal perception of wine; c13-norisoprenoids have received much interest in wine grapes . previous attempts to determine the role of ccd <dig> in plants through transgenic manipulation of its transcript levels have been performed in solanum lycopersicum   <cit> ; medicago truncatula   <cit> ; and oryza sativa   <cit> . these studies suggested that the observed in vitro functioning of ccd <dig>  oxidative cleavage of carotenoids) may not be its sole biological action in planta and that other genes may code for enzyme which are primarily responsible for catalysing this cleavage reaction in plastids  <cit> .

to date ccd <dig> orthologues have only been identified in angiosperms  and characterisation of ccd <dig> enzyme activity has shown that these members of the ccd family contribute to the carotenoid-derived flavour and aroma profile of both fruits and flowers. subcellular localisation studies in a. thaliana <cit>  and crocus sativus   <cit>  have demonstrated that the enzymes are targeted specifically to the plastoglobules within the plastids. unlike the cytosolic localisation of the ccd <dig> orthologues; the ccd <dig> localisation gives it access to its carotenoid substrates  <cit> . ccd <dig> enzymes often occur as two isoforms: ccd4a and ccd4b that share modest similarity to each other and have distinct expression patterns and potentially divergent functions in plants. based on reports from various plants there seems to be no consensus on the specific enzyme activity of the ccd <dig> enzymes.

although ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> enzymes catalyse the cleavage of carotenoids at the same double bond positions; ccd <dig> enzymes are proposed to be substrate-specific, whereas the ccd <dig> enzymes are commonly described and demonstrated as more promiscuous in their substrate preferences  <cit> . a study by huang et al. <cit>  concluded that ccd4s cannot catalyse the cleavage of linear carotenoids , or carotenoids that contain hydroxyl groups  and the current hypothesis is therefore that ccd <dig> orthologues catalyse cyclic non-polar carotenoid cleavage .

by identifying, isolating and characterising the grapevine ccds, putatively involved in flavour and aroma related apocarotenoid production, the current work aimed to elucidate the biological role of these genes and their respective enzymes in grapevine. this study reports the isolation of ccd <dig>  ccd4a and ccd4b-encoding genes from vitis vinifera l. cv pinotage. the ccds were characterised by determining their expression patterns and functionality in grapevine. functionality was described by analysing the volatile apocarotenoids formed following carotenoid cleavage in a heterologous escherichia coli  system. furthermore, a population of transgenic grapevine  with altered expression of vvccd <dig>  was generated and characterised genetically and phenotypically. leaf tissue of the transgenic sultana lines was analysed via hplc and gc/ms for the detection and quantification of carotenoids and volatile apocarotenoids, respectively.

grapevine transformation and regeneration
somatic embryogenic cultures of v. vinifera l. cv. sultana were used as source material for the genetic transformation experiments. the somatic embryogenic cultures were obtained and maintained according to the methods described in vasanth and vivier  <cit> . the genetic transformation protocol was essentially according to franks et al. <cit>  with some modifications to use liquid cultures as starting material . briefly, agrobacterium tumefaciens cells, containing either the overexpression or silencing vector, were harvested by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 10 min and resuspended in liquid nn medium, containing  <dig>  μg.ml- <dig> maltose to a final od <dig> of  <dig> . acetosyringone  was added to the agrobacterial suspension before 2 ml of the somatic embryogenic cell suspensions were added and left for 15 min, with gentle shaking three to five times during this period. the culture was filtered to remove the excess liquid and the callus blotted dry using sterile whatman no. <dig> filter paper. co-cultivation proceeded at 27°c in the dark for 2 days on solid nn medium supplemented with bap , noa  and acetosyringone . subsequently embryos were washed with sterile nn medium containing carbenicillin , blotted dry on sterilised filter paper and handled according to the protocol of franks et al.  <cit> . selection on kanamycin  was maintained until in vitro rooted plantlets were obtained, and subsequently hardened off in a greenhouse.

southern blot analysis

expression analysis of vvccds
primers for qrt-pcr for the expression analysis of vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a, vvccd4b, vvccd4c, vvccd4d, vvccd <dig> and vvccd <dig> were designed using primer express  <dig>   . the v. vinifera elongation factor 1α  was selected as a “house-keeping” gene to normalise gene expression based on the findings of reid et al. <cit>  and guillaumie et al. <cit> ; relative expression analysis of the vvccd gene family was performed in three different berry developmental stages, corresponding to green, vérasion and ripe berry stages of v. vinifera l. cv pinotage.

expression analysis of vvccd <dig> in the transgenic grapevine population was similarly performed via qrt-pcr. the grapevine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  gene was used as a “house-keeping” gene to normalise gene expression. the expression of vvgapdh has been shown to be relatively invariant in grapevine berries  <cit> . primers were designed to evaluate total vvccd <dig> expression , as well as expression derived from only the transgenic vvccd <dig> .

real-time pcr was performed using an applied biosystems  <dig> real-time pcr system. kapa sybr® fast qrt-pcr kit was used according to the manufacturer’s  instructions. the programme for the pcr reactions was: 50°c for 2 minutes; 95°c for 10 minutes; and 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°c and 60 seconds at 58°c. data were analysed using the applied biosystems sds software . all pcr reactions consisted of at least three technical replicates. relative expression was calculated using the equation as described by pfaffl  <cit> :

bacterial functional complementation and determination of volatile apocarotenoids in bacterial headspace
the extraction and analysis of the volatile apocarotenoids from bacterial cultures were performed based on a method described in lücker et al. <cit> . for clarity the method and relevant modifications are described in detail. ptwin1-vvccd <dig>  ptwin1-vvccd4a and ptwin1-vvccd4b plasmids were introduced into carotenoid accumulating e. coli strains. an empty vector, ptwin <dig>  was used as a negative control. an overnight culture  grown in lb media to saturation was used to inoculate 32 ml of lb containing the appropriate antibiotics  until an od600nm of  <dig>  was reached. the cultures were incubated in the dark, gently shaking at room temperature until an od <dig> nm of  <dig>  was reached. to prevent further production of coloured carotenoids the inhibitor diphenylamine  was added to a final concentration of 100 μm  and the cultures were incubated at room temperature for an additional two hours in the dark. after the two hour incubation with the inhibitor, 8 ml of the 32 ml culture was removed and flash frozen for carotenoid analysis; and the remaining 24 ml of culture was harvested for apocarotenoid analysis. for apocarotenoid analysis the cells were resuspended in 6 ml of lb containing the appropriate antibiotics,  <dig>  mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside , and 1 ppm of α-terpineol . in addition 6 mm ascorbate, 5 μm ferrous sulphate,  <dig> u/ml catalase were added as described in baldermann et al. <cit>  for in vitro ccd <dig> enzyme assays. the cultures were subsequently transferred to 20 ml spme vials. the vials were sealed with bi-metal®crimp seals with 20 mm silicone/polytetrafluoroethylene  septa . the samples were incubated in the dark, gently shaking at room temperature for 16 hours. after 16 hours, 1 ml of culture was removed for od600nm determination and 5 ml of 5 m nacl was added to the 5 ml remaining culture for volatile apocarotenoid extraction.

the hs-spme extraction of volatile apocarotenoids from the bacterial cultures was performed using a ctc combipal auto sampler equipped with the spme option . extraction conditions were as follows: after incubation at 50°c for 2 minutes spme extraction was performed for 15 min under constant agitation by exposing a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane  spme fibre  to the headspace. thereafter the fibre was desorbed and analytes subsequently injected onto the gc column using a split/splitless injector, operated at 240°c, splitless for 2 minutes. the fibre was left in the injector for a further 20 minutes at 270°c for conditioning of the fibre under a purge flow of 60 ml/min. separation of compounds was achieved on a db-ffap column  on an agilent  <dig> gas chromatograph coupled to an agilent 5975c mass spectrometer  . the helium carrier gas flow through the column was  <dig>  ml/min and the oven programmed from 40°c , ramped at 10°c/min to 230°c , with a post run at 240°c . the total run time was 30 minutes.

the ms was operated in electron impact  mode  using selected ion monitoring , simultaneously acquiring scan data as well. in sim mode the following m/z fragments were monitored: α-terpineol  , 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one  , geranyl acetone , α-ionone , β-ionone  and pseudo-ionone . compound identification was performed by both comparisons of the retention times with that of authentic standards and the nist <dig> mass spectral library . peaks of interest were quantified by external standard curves of the authentic standards. data were normalised to the internal standard concentration  and to the od <dig> of the bacterial cultures before hs-spme analysis.

chemical analysis of leaf photosynthetic pigments and volatile apocarotenoids
photosynthetic pigments of leaves were analysed using the method described in lashbrooke et al. <cit> .

leaf volatiles were extracted according to the method described by lücker et al. <cit>  with modifications. frozen, ground leaf tissue  was placed in a 20 ml spme vial and 10 ml of 20%  nacl containing 160 ng 3-octanol . the vial was sealed with a ptfe/silicon septum. samples in sealed spme vials were heated to 80°c and incubated for 5 minutes before the injection needle was pierced through the septum exposing the divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane  50/30 μm coated solid phase microextraction  fibre  to the headspace of the sample. during extraction the sample was stirred at 500 rpm and maintained at 80°c. after 15 minutes the fibre was removed and injected into the gc inlet where it was desorbed for 10 minutes at 260°c.

extracts were analysed using an agilent  <dig> gas chromatograph coupled to a waters gct time of flight  mass spectrometer   waters masslynx gc/ms workstation software were used to analyse the data. the injector port was heated to 260°c and splitless injection  was used. separation was performed on an hp5ms  column  with helium as the carrier gas at a constant flow of 1 ml.min- <dig>  the initial oven temperature was 40°c for 5 minutes, after which the temperature was increased by 5°c.min- <dig> to 150°c and then at 10°c.min- <dig> to 280°c . ionisation was in electron impact mode with an electron energy of 70 ev. the ms detector was set as follows: the transfer line, ion source and trap temperatures were  <dig>   <dig> and 150°c, respectively. the mass range was  <dig> to 650 m/z, with a scan rate of  <dig> scans.s- <dig>  compound identification was performed by both comparisons to the retention times of authentic standards and to the nist <dig> mass spectral library .

RESULTS
putative ccd-encoding gene isolation and characterisation
a phylogenetic tree of the ccd family from a. thaliana and v. vinifera and based on protein similarity is shown in figure  <dig>  from the molecular phylogenetic analysis five clades can be distinguished that correspond to the various orthologous groups , namely: nced, ccd <dig>  ccd <dig>  ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  in this study, three putative vvccd encoding genes  were isolated from v. vinifera l. cv pinotage cdna using primers described in additional file  <dig> 

vvccd <dig> is present in the grape genome as a tandem duplication on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the two gene copies are situated approximately 78 kb from each other and show 96% identity at the nucleic acid level and a 97% identity on the amino acid level. further, the  <dig>  kb genomic regions of the genes  share a 96% identity at the nucleic acid level. this suggests that the vvccd <dig> isomers are functional equivalents and are treated as such in further experiments. rnai constructs were designed to silence both isomers while real time primers did not distinguish between the two transcripts. southern blot analysis of vvccd <dig> confirmed that v. vinifera cv. sultana genomic dna possesses two copies of the gene . according to the genome sequence ccd4a and ccd4b are within 26 kb of each other on chromosome 2; both genomic copies consist of a single exon  and code for  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa proteins, respectively, sharing 70% identity on amino acid level.

an additional ccd <dig> orthologue  was identified through sequence similarity and was localised to chromosome  <dig>  however expression of this orthologue could not be detected in any of the tissues analysed and it was therefore not isolated.

in silico protein localisation predicted a cytosolic localisation for vvccd <dig> and a plastidial localisation for vvccd4a and vvccd4b . protein alignments between ccd orthologues display a highly conserved amino acid sequence . four crucial histidine residues that are conserved in ccd orthologues were identified in vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b   <cit> . these amino acids are involved in the binding of an iron cation  which has been shown to be a co-factor for the carotenoid cleavage reaction  <cit> .

functionality of the putative vvccd enzymes in escherichia coli
to determine the enzymatic function of the isolated putative ccd-encoding genes; the coding regions were cloned into an e. coli expression vector . the recombinant proteins were co-expressed in carotenoid accumulating e. coli strains engineered to accumulate specific carotenoids: phytoene , ζ-carotene , neurosporene , lycopene , ϵ-carotene  and β-carotene  strains as described in cunningham et al. <cit> . where possible, carotenoid production in the strains used was verified using uplc . enzyme activities were monitored after induction of the recombinant ccd proteins in the carotenoid-accumulating strains by measuring the formation of the volatile apocarotenoid cleavage products via headspace -spme gc/ms.

the data, as presented in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  shows that vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b are functional and have unique substrate preferences/specificities. vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b all catalysed lycopene cleavage  and ϵ-carotene . neurosporene cleavage was catalysed by only vvccd4a and vvccd4b . only vvccd <dig>  however, catalysed β-carotene cleavage to form β-ionone; and only vvccd4b catalysed ζ-carotene cleavage to form geranyl acetone. none of the three ccds demonstrated an ability to catalyse the cleavage of phytoene. the production of α-ionone from ϵ-carotene provides evidence that vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b possess the ability to catalyse  <dig>  cleavage, whereas the formation of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one from lycopene demonstrates additional catalysis of  <dig>  cleavage.

spatial and temporal expression of ccds in grapevine organs
the expression levels of vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a, vvccd4b, vvccd4c, vvccd <dig> and vvccd <dig> were analysed in leaves, flowers and three grape berry developmental stages: green, véraison and ripe . no expression could be detected for vvccd4c, vvccd <dig> or vvccd <dig> in any of the tissues or developmental stages tested using a qrt-pcr assay , and therefore only expression of vvccd <dig>  -4a and -4b are reported and discussed further. the data shows that the vvccds were expressed in all tissues analysed. specific patterns were, however, evident in the expression profiles: vvccd <dig> expression appeared constitutive with the highest relative levels in leaves. vvccd4a was most abundant in leaves; whereas vvccd4b expression was highest in berries. vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b were all expressed in flower tissue at relatively low levels.

the lowest relative expression levels for vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b were all in young  berries. the highest vvccd <dig> and vvccd4a expression levels were in leaf tissue; whereas the highest expression for vvccd4b was in ripe berries . vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b expression all increased with development  in the berry stages. vvccd <dig> and vvccd4a expression peaked and levelled off at véraison, whereas vvccd4b expression increased dramatically throughout berry ripening.

transgenic manipulation of vvccd <dig> levels
transformation of v vinifera l. cv sultana with a part27-vvccd <dig> overexpression cassette, was confirmed by southern hybridisation . digestion of genomic dna with spei resulted in a single hybridisation band per integration event as the restriction enzyme digests outside of the zone of hybridisation. analysis of the transgenic plants showed that six of the nine lines represented independent integration events, with a transgene copy number ranging between one and four. the ccd1- <dig> and ccd1- <dig> lines, as well as the ccd1- <dig>  ccd1- <dig>  and ccd1- <dig> lines were considered clonal . twelve lines were shown to be positive for transformation/integration of the transgene with a silencing cassette via pcr screening .

the level of vvccd <dig> expression in the transgenic lines was monitored via qrt-pcr. of the six lines independently transformed with part27-vvccd <dig>  only two lines showed significant overexpression of vvccd <dig>  . qrt-pcr expression analysis demonstrated transcription of the endogenous gene as well as the introduced transgene in all the lines, yet four lines displayed total vvccd <dig> gene expression levels which were not significantly increased  . it is interesting to note that the transgene-derived expression was fairly constant whereas the endogenous gene expression was more affected. of the twelve lines positively transformed with part27-ccd <dig>  seven showed significant silencing when compared to the wild-type lines . silencing of vvccd <dig> of up to 85%  was observed. targeted metabolite analyses were performed on plant lines with expression levels that differed significantly from the wild-type to determine if the carotenoid  and/or the volatile apocarotenoid profiles  were affected/altered.

carotenoid, chlorophyll and apocarotenoid analysis of transgenic grapevine lines
rp-hplc analysis of pigments extracted from the transgenic population showed no significant correlation between vvccd <dig> expression levels and the concentration of carotenoids in grapevine leaf tissue under the conditions tested . similarly, no correlation between vvccd <dig> expression and leaf norisoprenoid levels were observed in the same tissue . total carotenoid content however, showed strong positive correlation to the total chlorophyll content of the leaves  .

discussion
vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b catalyse the cleavage of a broad range of carotenoid substrates
the enzymatic catalysation of the cleavage of carotenoids by ccds has been shown to produce volatile flavour and aroma apocarotenoids including α-ionone, β-ionone and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one  in a range of plant species. apocarotenoids contribute to the floral and fruity attributes of many wine cultivars and are thereby partly responsible for the “varietal character” of grapes and wine . here we confirmed the functionality of vvccd <dig>  and for the first time vvccd4a and vvccd4b on a range of carotenoid substrates. the identification of ccd <dig> orthologues from grapevine has recently been reported  <cit> ; and guillaumie et al. <cit>  tested a ccd4a isolated from v. vinifera cv chardonnay on ζ-carotene, lycopene, β-carotene, and zeaxanthin, but could not show functionality on any of the substrates tested. ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> orthologues in other plant species have been shown to catalyse cleavage of a number of c40-carotenoid and c30-apocarotenoid substrates. here we show vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b are capable of catalysis of the cleavage of c <dig> carotenoid substrates at the  <dig>   <dig>   and lycopene at the  <dig>   <dig>  double bond position to release the corresponding c <dig> apocarotenoid products , confirming cleavage of both cyclic and linear substrates. this is the first example of a ccd <dig> enzyme catalysing the cleavage of linear carotenoids and is in contrast to the conclusions made by huang et al. <cit>  who, after analysing the functionality of ccd4s from five different plant species  concluded that ccd4s catalyse the cleavage of cyclic non-polar carotenoids  and not linear carotenoids . interestingly, only vvccd4b catalysed the cleavage of ζ-carotene and neither vvccd4a nor vvccd4b could catalyse β-carotene cleavage. none of the ccds tested catalysed the cleavage of phytoene. these results are in agreement with the hypothesis by vogel et al. <cit> , who suggest that ccd-catalysed cleavage only occurs when a double bond is found adjacent to the bond that is to be cleaved. in the case of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig>  cleavage a double bond must therefore be found at the  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig>   <dig>  positions, respectively. phytoene does not possess these double bonds and is therefore not cleaved. the ability of vvccd4b to catalyse the cleavage of ζ-carotene to form geranylacetone, but not mho, further illustrates this point . carotenoids containing hydroxyl groups  as potential substrates for the vvccd <dig> catalysed cleavage were not investigated in our study and remains to be evaluated.

mathieu et al. <cit>  used an in vitro enzyme assay to demonstrate that a vvccd <dig> from v. vinifera l. cv shiraz catalysed the cleavage of the xanthophylls zeaxanthin and lutein to form 3-hydroxy-β-ionone. the authors stated that β-carotene was tested as a substrate, but that it was not cleaved in their assay. vvccd <dig> isolated from v. vinifera l. cv pinotage in this study, however, was capable of catalysing the cleavage of lycopene, β-carotene and ϵ-carotene, but not neurosporene and ζ-carotene . cross-comparing results from different studies are often complicated by the differences in the assays utilised for experiments of this nature  and/or the choice of analytical methods used to generate the data . one of the advantages of the in vivo assay used in this study is the controlling and validation of the specific carotenoid substrates. carotenoid biosynthesis in the e. coli strains was controlled by the addition of the carotenoid pathway inhibitor diphenylamine  whereas the carotenoid produced in the respective strains after 2 hours of dpa inhibition were verified by uplc before induction of the respective ccds. steps were further taken to prevent the oxidative, non-enzymatic degradation of the carotenoids and a co-factor was added to ensure functionality of the ccd enzymes in the in vivo assays .

in vivo functions of the isolated vvccds
vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b influence the flavour and aroma potential of grapes
vvccd <dig>  -4a and 4b, were all up-regulated during ripening , and are therefore all potentially involved in the enzymatic degradation of carotenoids to the respective aromatic c13-norisoprenoids that contribute to the distinctive varietal character of grapes and wine. since the vvccd <dig>  -4a and -4b are all expressed during ripening, the specific carotenoid substrate available for cleavage, as well as the substrate specificity of the respective vvccd present, will determine the c13-norisoprenoid formed in grapes. although vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b are expressed during berry development; vvccd4b showed the most berry-specific expression profile and the highest upregulation throughout berry ripening  and appears to be the isoform most likely responsible for catalysing carotenoid cleavage in ripening berries. vvccd4a showed the highest expression in leaves and vvccd <dig> maintains relatively constant levels in all tissues tested. in agreement with the expression data presented here, mathieu et al. <cit>  showed similar trends for vvccd <dig> expression in berries , and, while the authors noted an increase in the c13-norisoprenoid content of muscat , this occurred two weeks after the increase in vvccd <dig> expression. numerous studies on grape berry carotenoid composition have shown that carotenoid concentrations decrease during ripening  <cit> . the inverse correlation observed between carotenoids and c13-norisoprenoids lead crupi et al. <cit>  to propose that the change in carotenoid concentration in grape berries from véraison stage to the ripe  stages could be used to estimate the aromatic potential of the grapes.

vvccd4a and vvccd4b are candidates for maintenance of carotenoid levels during photosynthesis
the relative abundance of oxygenated carotenoids  is conserved and tightly regulated in photosynthetic tissues and is largely due to the involvement of specific pigments in the photosynthetic reaction centres of photosystems  i and ii  and the light harvesting antennae complexes .

although carotenoid composition is considered highly conserved in photosynthetic organisms with the ubiquitous presence of the xanthophylls lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin most notable; mutant studies in a. thaliana have shown that a certain degree of plasticity is tolerated in plants. plants have been shown to be viable even in the absence of lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin, but these xanthophylls are required for optimal seedling development and photoprotection, and surprisingly to a lesser extent photosynthesis  <cit> .

the vvccd <dig> transgenic lines also showed positive correlation between the concentrations of chlorophyll and carotenoids in mature photosynthetically active leaves . this is expected as carotenoids are primarily involved in photosynthesis specifically in vegetative tissue  <cit> . an increase in chlorophyll concentration is indicative of increased photosynthetic activity, which in turn puts more demand on the carotenoids involved in light-harvesting and photoprotection  <cit> . it is therefore not surprising that the carotenoid pathway is tightly regulated in leaf tissue, as loss of these crucial pigments would lead to an impaired and consequently sub-optimal plant  <cit> .

beisel et al. <cit>  demonstrated continuous synthesis and degradation of carotenoids and chlorophyll a in mature leaves of arabidopsis. this turnover of carotenoids and chlorophylls appears crucial for the maintenance of active photosynthesis and for adaptation to changing light conditions. it is possible that the ccds  are involved in the maintenance of the optimal carotenoid composition in photosynthetic tissue. static plants confronted with an ever-changing environment must be capable of maintaining an optimal carotenoid composition in photosynthetic tissues. due to their localisation and substrate specificities, ccds may be involved in this regulation and maintenance. we show that the cytosolic vvccd <dig> catalyses lycopene, β-carotene and ϵ-carotene  cleavage , whereas the chloroplast localised vvccd4a and vvccd4b catalyses lycopene, neurosporene and ϵ-carotene  cleavage . only vvccd4b was able to catalyse ζ-carotene cleavage. of these carotenoid substrates, only β-carotene is present at detectable levels in grapevine leaves and berries , where it forms part of photosystem i and –ii. differential transcriptional regulation and the physical separation of the carotenoid substrates  from the vvccd <dig> enzyme  therefore add additional layers of possible control.

altering the expression of vvccd <dig> in transgenic grapevine suggests sub-cellular compartmentalisation regulates ccd activity
our transgenic data confirmed a level of protection from manipulation of the carotenoid pathway, specifically from altered levels of vvccd <dig>  significant overexpression of the vvccd <dig> was only observed in 30% of the southern positive grapevine lines. this was not due to a non-functional construct, since qrt-pcr experiments verified endogenous and the transgenic vvccd <dig> expression in the plant lines . in spite of the partial silencing of most of the overexpression lines ; lines were generated that exhibited varying degrees of overexpression of vvccd <dig> . the overexpressing lines, together with the lines that showed successful silencing, resulted in a population of transgenic plants that exhibited an up to ~12-fold range of vvccd <dig> expression .

despite this range in vvccd <dig> expression no direct phenotype was observed in the vegetative  tissue tested for either the carotenoids  or apocarotenoids  based on known vvccd <dig> enzyme activity. mathieu et al. <cit>  monitored ripening berries and found a similar discrepancy  between vvccd <dig> expression and apocarotenoid production. since quantification of the vvccd <dig> protein was not performed on the transgenic lines, it is not possible to speculate on the relationship between vvccd <dig> transcripts and vvccd <dig> protein, but it is known that a positive correlation between mrna levels and protein levels is far less common than often assumed  <cit> . another factor that could contribute to the lack of an observable phenotype in the leaf tissue analysed, is the compartmentalisation of the enzymes within a plant cell. in silico analysis suggest that vvccd <dig> is localised in the cytosol. this has been shown to be the case for many ccd <dig> orthologues  <cit> . the carotenoid cleavage substrates that ccd <dig> has been shown to catalyse in vitro, however, are situated in the chloroplast membrane, and are thus inaccessible to the ccd <dig> enzyme  <cit> .

previous attempts to manipulate the expression levels of ccd <dig> transcripts have also led to phenotypes inconsistent with the observed in vitro activity of ccd <dig>  <cit> . simkin et al. <cit>  reduced leccd <dig> mrna levels by up to 90% in tomato leaves and fruit using an antisense construct, but did not observe any change in the carotenoid concentration in fruit with reduced ccd <dig> levels, and only a 50% decrease in the β-ionone concentration in selected silenced lines. no data was presented for carotenoid or norisoprenoid levels in tomato leaves with reduced ccd <dig> levels. ilg et al. <cit>  suggested that in planta osccd <dig> may catalyse apocarotenoid cleavage rather than carotenoids. a similar reduction of the norisoprenoids observed in tomato fruit with reduced ccd <dig> transcripts was not seen in grapevine leaves . these studies, and supported by the results presented in this study, suggest that the in planta role of ccd <dig> may in fact not be maintenance of carotenoid levels, but catalysing apocarotenoid cleavage. it is not surprising when considering that the leaf is the primary photosynthetic organ of the plant and therefore needs to maintain this function. the correlation observed between chlorophyll concentration and carotenoid concentration in the leaf  indicates that the level of photosynthetic activity of the tissue has a much greater influence on the concentration of carotenoids. in the chromoplasts of ripe fruit the need for photoprotection of the chlorophylls is absent and the segregation of ccd <dig> and its carotenoid substrates is possibly diminished. however, despite the predicted cytosolic localisation of ccd <dig> and its apparent lack of transcript correlation with carotenoid and norisoprenoid concentrations, norisoprenoids are still formed in the leaves . this suggests another mechanism of action for the cleavage of carotenoids and the production of norisoprenoids. the ccd4s are the most likely candidates due to the fact that the vvccd4a and vvccd4b transcripts are upregulated during berry development ; subcellularly both vvccd4a and vvccd4b are predicted to co-localise with carotenoids in the chloroplast; and the catalysis of carotenoid cleavage by vvccd4a and vvccd4b have been demonstrated.

on a sub-organellar level, a number of carotenoid metabolic enzymes have been identified in the plastoglobule proteome of a. thaliana, including ccd <dig> and ccd <dig>  interestingly the ccd <dig> protein represented  <dig> % of the total mass of the plastoglobule proteome  <cit> . plastoglobules are thylakoid-associated lipoprotein particles found in plastids . it is thought that lipid exchange  can occur between the plastoglobules and the thylakoid membrane. the size and abundance of plastoglobules in chloroplasts are affected by a number of developmental and environmental conditions, and includes stresses  and transitions from chloroplasts to gerontoplasts  and chloroplast to chromoplast transitions .

plastids can differentiate and dedifferentiate and the size and number of plastoglobules increases during these transitions. it is interesting to note that ccd <dig>  ccd <dig> and ccd <dig> have been localised to plastoglobules; and that the carotenoid substrates accumulate, and can be formed de novo in plastoglobules. the in planta role of the ccds in these lipoprotein structures is still not clear. if they are required to maintain the carotenoid composition and/or it is for the production of the apocarotenoid cleavage product that drives carotenoid cleavage remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
to summarise, vvccd <dig> in grapevine leaves appears to be under various levels of control. all factors being considered, the importance of the carotenoid composition for effective photosynthesis is the most likely reason for this control in the leaf. the control is applied at the transcript level, where a form of post-transcriptional gene silencing was observed in the transgenic vvccd <dig> population; and possibly on the protein level, where sub-cellular compartmentalisation may prevent interaction between vvccd <dig> and its carotenoid substrate. the substrate specificity of the respective vvccds characterised in this study , suggest another level where control can be exerted. despite the fact that vvccd <dig> has the ability to catalyse the cleavage of multiple carotenoids in vitro, the in planta substrates for cleavage may be primarily c <dig> apocarotenoids produced through cleavage by enzymatic action  that can last in excess of three years, excluded the analysis of berries from the transgenic populations generated from the scope of this study.

the isolation and functional characterisation of vvccd4a and vvccd4b provides additional candidate cleavage enzymes affecting the carotenoid composition in the chloroplast, as well as the production of volatile apocarotenoids in grapevine. their differential expression in various plant tissues and the differential substrate specificities of the vvccd <dig>  vvccd4a and vvccd4b suggests that ccds have distinct roles in different plants, plant tissues and even different subcellular compartments of plants . future studies on, for example, the senescing leaves and grape berries from the transgenic lines generated in this study will be of great importance in further elucidating the in planta function of ccds. generation of transgenic grapevine altered in vvccd <dig> expression as well as future studies on the senescing leaves and grape berries from the transgenic lines generated in this study will be of great importance in further elucidating the in planta function of ccds.
