BACKGROUND
saccharopolyspora erythraea, formerly identified as streptomyces erythraeus, is a gram-positive filamentous bacterium. it has been used for the industrial-scale production of erythromycin a, a broad-spectrum macrolide antibiotic against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the antimicrobial spectrum of erythromycin a is similar to that of penicillin, and erythromycin a is often prescribed as an alternative for patients with an allergy to penicillin. moreover, a series of derivatives of erythromycin, derived by chemical and biotechnological transformation, have been shown to have antiparasitic, antineoplastic, immunosuppressant, neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory, and gastroenteric therapeutic activities  <cit> . in view of the high clinical importance of erythromycin and its derivatives, extensive efforts have been devoted to increase the erythromycin production in s. erythraea which has even been studied as a model system for antibiotic production  <cit> .

over the past 50 years, the s. erythraea strain improvement has been carried out mainly by multiple rounds of random mutagenesis and selection  <cit> . meanwhile, erythromycin productivity has also been enhanced by the optimization of fermentation process  <cit> . since 1990s, genetic studies have provided insights into the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis, and the erythromycin gene cluster was found to contain  <dig> genes arranged in four major polycistronic units  <cit> , which facilitated strain improvements by genetic and metabolic engineering  <cit> . recently, bldd, a key developmental regulator in actinomycetes  <cit> , was identified to positively regulate the synthesis of erythromycin at the transcriptional level  <cit> , which opened the possibility of enhancing the erythromycin production by modifying the regulation mechanism. however, bldd was later reported to exhibit an opposite gene expression pattern with respect to most of ery genes in a higher-producing strain  <cit> , which made the regulation mechanism underlying erythromycin production complicated and confusing. as a result, the engineering works have still been focusing on erythromycin biosynthesis pathway  <cit>  and feeder pathway  <cit> .

noticing that genetic modifications targeting to crucial genes are sometimes lethal, people realized that omics data may pave the way for the productivity optimization at the whole-genome scale from the perspective of systems biology  <cit> . in recent years, the development of high-throughput technologies has revived efforts to increase strain productivity  <cit> . for example, a new regulator of avermectin biosynthesis in streptomyces avermitilis, hrdb, was identified through transcriptome profiling in our previous study, and increased productivity was achieved by modifying the hrdb gene  <cit> .

the complete genome of s. erythraea strain nrrl <dig> was sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> , which allows more rational improvement of strains to achieve high-titer erythromycin production. several expression microarray experiments based on the wild-type strain and mutant strains including both overproducing and defected strains were later on released  <cit> . it was found that genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis cluster and feeder pathway were up-regulated at the transcriptional level in overproducing strains. even though, the global genetic basis for erythromycin biosynthesisis far from full elucidation.

in this work, we sequenced the whole genome of a high-producing strain  obtained from random mutagenesis and screening, and examined time-series expression profiles of both e <dig> and the wild-type strain nrrl <dig>  a large number of genomic variations, including  <dig> insertions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> single nucleotide variations  were identified in e <dig> in comparison with nrrl23338; the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways were significantly up-regulated during the 60 hours time-course. according to our data, bldd did not show any positive correlations with the expression of ery cluster, implying alternative regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in s. erythraea, and/or the combinatorial effects of various regulation mechanisms. by integrating comparative genomic data to comparative transcriptomic data, we proposed several regulators which are potentially associated with erythromycin production. this functional comparative genomics work represents an important step towards understanding the over-producing mechanism of s. erythraea strain e <dig> on a genomic scale, and provided useful clues to strain engineering for improved production of erythromycin.

RESULTS
s. erythraea e <dig> strain genome features and comparisons with nrrl <dig> strain
the main features of the genome sequence of high-producing strain e <dig> are schematically represented in figure  <dig>  and summarized in comparison with wild-type strain nrrl <dig> in table  <dig> 

cds, protein-coding sequence. *attributed to a statistical error of the previous literature.

the genome of strain e <dig> is comprised of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> ,523 bp, which is  <dig> % smaller than that of nrrl <dig>   <cit> . the average gc content of the e <dig> genome is  <dig> %, almost the same as nrrl <dig>   <cit> . the replication origin of e <dig> genome was determined by homology mapping to nrrl <dig>  which was identified based on gc skew and the position of the replication origin oric. in strain e <dig>  there is a definite gc skew inversion at oric and also on the opposite side of the chromosome to oric. the initiation codon of the dnaa gene, adjacent to oric, was set as the starting point for numbering the coding sequences.

the overall features of e <dig> genome are highly similar to nrrl <dig> . in summary, e <dig> contains a total of  <dig>  predicted coding sequences, including  <dig> protein-coding sequences ,  <dig> trna genes, and  <dig> rrna genes in four copies of 16s-23s-5s rrna operons. the coding density is  <dig> %, identical to strain nrrl  <dig>  the  <dig> trna genes encode all trnas required for protein biosynthesis. the rrna gene number of e <dig> strain,  <dig>  is different from that of nrrl <dig> reported earlier,  <dig>  <cit> . to address this doubt, we carefully compared the rrna coding regions of two strains, and found that their sequences are completely identical. we then noticed that there are actually only  <dig> rrna coding gene records of nrrl <dig>  but not the claimed  <dig>  deposited in ncbi. all these observations suggest that there should be a total of  <dig> rrna genes in both e <dig> and nrrl <dig>  among the  <dig> cdss, a putative function could be ascribed to  <dig>  of these. of the rest,  <dig>  showed similarity to hypothetical proteins in other genomes, and  <dig>   had no substantial similarity to predicted proteins in public databases.

similar to the nrrl <dig> strain, the core region of the genome, extending either side of the oric and ending in the regions of markedly lower gc content , accounts for a total of  <dig>  mbp. in comparison with the regions outside the core, the core region shows substantial conservation when comparing with other actinobacteria   <cit> .

the genomic changes in e <dig> relative to nrrl <dig> involve  <dig> insertions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> single nucleotide variations  . most of the variations occur in intragenic regions:  <dig> out of  <dig> insertions,  <dig> out of  <dig> deletions and  <dig> out of the  <dig> snvs are located in intragenic regions, and the other  <dig> insertions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> snvs are located in intergenic regions . based on the intragenic variations, which are expected to contribute to the altered phenotype, we identified  <dig> proteins whose amino acid sequence is changed by snvs,  <dig> proteins and  <dig> proteins which are affected by deletions and insertions respectively . these altered proteins are overrepresented in the cog categories of “replication, recombination and repair” with p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  and “signal transduction mechanisms” with p-value of  <dig> .

the largest variation between e <dig> and nrrl <dig> genomes is an 11 kb deletion which spans  <dig> genes including a predicted integrase and a predicted aminoglycoside phosphotranserase as well as  <dig> hypothetical proteins . it is likely to be a prophage  because its gene content and organization are very similar to the isolated plasmids pse <dig> and pse <dig> previously identified in strain nrrl <dig>  <cit> . moreover, e <dig> genome are found to contain integrated pse <dig> and pse <dig>  one copy for each plasmid, which include <dig> and  <dig> candidate protein-encoding genes respectively, spanning  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb  <cit> . it is noticeable that the integrated plasmid regions in strain e <dig> and the isolated pse <dig> and pse <dig> in strain nrrl <dig> share an integrase  gene.

comparative transcriptome analysis between e <dig> and nrrl <dig> strains
beyond the whole genome sequencing of two s. erythraea strains, high-producing e <dig> and the wild-type nrrl <dig>  we designed a time-course microarray experiment to investigate the gene expression profiles of e <dig> and nrrl <dig>  six time points 10 h, 16 h, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, 60 h were chosen according to the growth curve  <cit>  and erythromycin production curve  of s. erythraea.

a total of  <dig> genes  were identified to be differentially expressed  in terms of between-time series, which emphasizes on the expression variation at the same time point between two strains. the differentially expressed genes  were then clustered into  <dig> groups according to the pattern of expression change: up-regulated in strain e <dig>  down-regulated in strain e <dig>  different expression pattern across time between two strains .

according to the functional enrichment analysis results based on cog category annotation  <cit>  ,  energy production and conversion and  secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism are up-regulated in strain e3;  posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones and  amino acid transport and metabolism are over-represented both in up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes in strain e <dig>  indicating that these functions present different activities in two strains, and some of the related genes are up-regulated in e <dig> while some are down-regulated . additionally,  replication, recombination and repair are enriched in the genes with different expression profile across time between two strains. among them, we carefully scrutinized the specific pathways related to fermentation physiology, including erythromycin biosynthesis, feeder pathway, transporters, energy production and secondary metabolite synthesis.

erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways
noticeably, all genes  in erythromycin biosynthesis cluster  were dramatically up-regulated  for the duration of 60 hours time-course in the overproducing strain e <dig> in comparison with the wild-type nrrl <dig> , consistent with previous observations that the expression of ery cluster was correlated to erythromycin production  <cit> . moreover, the feeder pathway was also activated in e <dig> . in many streptomycetes, at least four pathways have been characterized to be connected to the methylmalonyl-coa pool : mcm pathway which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of succinyl-coa and methymalonyl-coa, ccr pathway utilizing crotonyl-coa reductase or adenosylcobalamin-dependent isobutyryl-coa mutase, meaa pathway from acetoacetyl-coa, and pcc pathway through carboxylation of propionyl-coa by proprionyl-coa carboxylase. it was found that s. erythraea has no ccr pathway and meaa pathway for the precursor supply  <cit> . genome sequence analysis suggests that pcc pathway may play a role in precursor flow in s. erythraea. in s. erythraea at least five genetic loci  might encode biotin-dependent carboxylases catalyzing carboxylation of propionyl-coa to methylmalonyl-coa. so far, it is still unclear which gene set makes a contribution to erythromycin biosynthesis. comparative transcriptome analysis found that only sace_ <dig> gene displayed obvious up-regulation in high-producing strain e <dig>  indicating that over-expression of sace_ <dig> may enhance supply of methylmalonyl-coa through carboxylation of propionyl-coa. further experiments are required to validate this assumption.

the expression of genes encoding key enzymes of carbon and fatty acid metabolisms was also significantly changed in turn affecting the flux of metabolites through erythromycin feeder pathways. the industrial strain e <dig> exhibited an impressive activation of fatty acid catabolic pathway, glycolysis/citrate cycle pathways, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway that supplies propionyl-coa and methymalonyl-coa for biosynthesis of 6-deoxyerythronolide b. the genes coding for key enzymes of valine, leucine and isoleucine catabolic pathway  were strongly over-expressed in industrial strain e <dig>  up-regulation of genes involved in fatty acid catabolic pathway, including sace_ <dig>  coding for long-chain acyl-coa synthetase, sace_ <dig>  sace_ <dig>  sace_ <dig>  encoding acetyl-coa acetyltransferase, maybe also lead to the increased propionyl-coa in strain e <dig>  the glycolysis/citrate cycle pathways are connected to the feeder pathway of erythromycin biosynthesis via succinyl-coa, an important metabolite of the krebs cycle. transcription of gap, pgk, tpia and eno in glycolysis was moderately elevated in strain e <dig>  most genes of tca cycle, including sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_3926/sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig>  and sace_6668/ <dig> , showed higher expression level, as compared to wild-type strain. it was found that the variations affected three genes of the krebs cycle, including sace_ <dig> , sace_ <dig> and sace_ <dig> .

these results demonstrate that enhanced level of erythromycin biosynthesis in strain e <dig> is likely to be attributed to the alterations in many pathways, and the up-regulation of erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathway seemed to be crucial events.

transporters
differential expression analysis showed that genes encoding phosphate transport system , iron ion uptake system , d-methionine transport system , and sulfonate/nitrate/taurine transport system  were significantly activated, among which the transport of d-methionine  was most activated . phop-regulated phn operon  was induced by  <dig>  folds. moreover, several genes involved in nitrogen sources intake and assimilation were inhibited in e <dig> strain, including the oligopeptide transporter operons , amino acid transporter operon , glutamate transporter operon , glutamine transporter operon , and ammonium transporter gene . the most repressed gene was amt . it was observed that the genes related to phosphate and nitrogen transport were differentially expressed between two strains. compared with nrrl <dig>  e <dig> showed phosphate starvation response and repressive nitrogen-metabolism through the entire time-course. these observations indicated that p-n metabolism balance may play an important role in the overproducing strain e <dig> 

energy production
generally speaking, the expression of genes involved in bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation was moderately enhanced in industrial e <dig> strain, which may contribute to energy supply for erythromycin production. the most important members of this group are nuo operon encoding nadh dehydrogenase i  and atp operon coding for atp synthases . this is consistent with the observation that the nuo genes exhibited higher expression level in mutant rif <dig>  than wild type and mutant rif <dig> strains   <cit> .

secondary metabolite synthesis
there are  <dig> clusters  for the biosynthesis of polyketides, terpenes and nonribosomally synthesized peptides in the s. erythraea genome. three clusters  of the six terpene synthase gene clusters, three pks gene clusters , and one gene cluster encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetase  were activated in strain e <dig> in comparison with nrrl <dig> . among these up-regulated gene clusters, pks <dig>  showed the most significantly induced expression . in contrast, only two gene clusters for production of secondary metabolites  were inhibited in e <dig>  this indicated the general enhancement of secondary metabolite synthesis in high producing strain.

since differential coexpression analysis  is much more useful than traditional differential expression analysis  for investigating the global transcriptional mechanisms underlying the associated phenotypic changes  <cit> , we then ranked genes according to its differential coexpression with the others in the coexpression network by using dcp method  <cit>  . noticeably, ure operon, nar operon, nir operon, glna <dig>  glnb), involved in nitrogen metabolism, were differentially coexpressed, implying an altered coordination of nitrogen metabolism with the other functions in strain e <dig> compared with nrrl <dig> 

functional genomics analysis
after separately analyzing the genomic data and transcriptomic data, we set out to explore the links between genomic variations and transcriptomic variations, which provide an opportunity to identify causative mutations accounting for the high productivity, and eventually elucidate the regulation mechanisms underlying the erythromycin synthesis.

we first focused on the ery cluster genes, including the promoter regions, and found that they were identical at the genomic level in both strains, but significantly up-regulated at the transcriptional level in high-producing strain e <dig>  we then resorted to the upstream regulatory factors of ery cluster. the coordinate alteration of the ery cluster gene expression suggested that the ery cluster may be co-regulated by the regulator, whose differences at the sequence level in two strains may lead to the expression difference of ery cluster. the transcriptional regulator, bldd , which was reported to positively regulate the ery cluster  <cit> , however, showed lower expression level in overproducing strain e <dig>  opposite to the ery genes. this was consistent with the data reported more recently  <cit> . it seems that the regulatory effect of of bldd on ery cluster needs further investigation. at least, there must be other regulatory factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of ery genes.

we manually checked the annotation information of these genomic variant genes, and found a total of  <dig> potential regulators . according to the comparison to the sequence of orthologous genes in closely related species,  <dig> genes were supposed to be mutated in e <dig> and  <dig> genes were supposed to be mutated in nrrl23338;  <dig> genes were uncertain as no orthologues of them were found. we focused on the two regulators, mtra and moxr, which were mutated in the functional domain regions in strain e <dig> 

in s. erythraea, sace_6447-sace_ <dig> operon encodes proteins that are homologous to the products of the mtrab-lpqb genes of mycobacterium tuberculosis. mtra is a member of the ompr/phob family of response regulators, forming a two-component system  with its cognate sensor kinase . according to ncbi conserved domain database , pfam , and the three-dimensional structure drawn from mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> , mtra possesses two domains, an n-terminal regulatory domain displaying the classic α/β fold and a c-terminal dna-binding domain with a winged helix-turn-helix. mtra has been related to the regulation of diverse cellular functions  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, sco3011-sco <dig> operon appears to be an orthologue of the mtrab-lpqb operon. the function of this operon is unclear but null mutations in mtrb and lpqb affect normal septation and sporulation. attempts to disrupt mtra have so far been unsuccessful, suggesting this may also be an essential gene in streptomyces <cit> . analysis of the limited experimental research available on mtrab suggests that the primary role of mtrab is in regulating cell cycle progression, the composition and function of the cell envelope or, perhaps more likely, in responding to general stresses that could ultimately inhibit cell division. however, many questions remain about the mtrab two-component system in streptomyces, such as: how does mtrab govern growth and mtrab govern growth and development? how does mtrab play a role in antibiotic biosyntheses? to date, no experimental work has been performed on this operon, so information about its function in the cell is not available. recently the direct repeats of gtcacagcg-like consensus sequences  recognized by mtra were identified in m. tuberculosis <cit> , but we failed to find it in s. erythraea genome, indicating that s. erythraea has distinct mtra binding site upstream of the target genes  <cit> . although both mtra and mtrb werenot differentially expressed between two s. erythraea strains, mtraofe <dig> strain had two amino acids deleted , compared to m. tuberculosis and s. erythraea nrrl <dig>  the deletion was located in the c-terminal domain, and specifically, next to the dna-binding site, v <dig> .

we therefore applied homology modeling to study the variation sites of e <dig> mtra in the structural context. it was found that the deleted sites in the m. tuberculosis model was in an α-helix , which may lead to the distortion of the related helix or even more. this probably interfere its dna binding activity, and thus the regulatory activity of mtra. follow-up functional experiments of mtra in s. erythraea will help to identify its regulatory role in antibiotic synthesis.

we also observed another interesting regulator, moxr . the moxr family is a subset of aaa + atpases, a large, diverse group of atpases associated with various cellular activities including cell-cycle regulation, dna repair and replication, protein proteolysis and disaggregation, and so on. moxr is often observed in close proximity to von willebrand factor type a  proteins and are likely to function with them to form a chaperone system. more importantly, moxr also acts as dna helicases and transcription factors  <cit> . in s. erythraea, the moxr gene is immediately adjacent to two genes  encoding vwa proteins. a single-nucleotide variation  was identified in e <dig> moxr gene , compared with nrrl <dig> and other related species, such as actinosynnema mirum dsm  <dig>  when searching ncbi cdd, we found this protein was a putative member of the aaa +  superfamily. the sequence alignment showed that the variation n133d was located in the very vicinity of atp-binding site  and walker b motif , suggesting that the substitution may perturb its activity of atp and mg++ binding, although the homology modeling result did not provide further evidence. additionally, of the  <dig> regulator genes, moxr gene was mostly strongly over-expressed in industrial strain e <dig> compared with nrrl <dig> .

discussion
erythromycin and its semi-synthetic derivatives are widely used in the clinic, and thus improved producers are highly sought after. in recent years, the availability of the entire genome sequence of s. erythraea has opened the possibility of defining the erythromycin biosynthesis mechanisms by using global approaches  <cit> . these high-throughput approaches have led to the discovery that bldd, a key developmental regulator in actinomycetes  <cit> , which activates the synthesis of erythromycin at the transcriptional level  <cit> . meanwhile, there is evidence that increasing the flux through feeder metabolic pathways strongly influences the erythromycin yields, which has been recently obtained by engineering the methylmalonyl-coa metabolite node in s. erythraea and in a. erythreum, a non-filamentous erythromycin a producer  <cit> .

in our present work, the comparative analysis of s. erythraea overproducing e <dig> and wild-type nrrl <dig>  at both genomic and transcriptomic level, indicate that ery clustering for erythromycin synthesis is up-regulated in e <dig> as expected, whereas e <dig> and nrrl <dig> have identical ery genomic sequences . furthermore, the feeder pathways were also activated in e <dig> strain. this could elevate the concentrations of propionyl-coa and methymalonyl-coa, the precursor metabolites of erythromycin production , and thus improve the erythromycin yield. indeed, increased supply of methylmalonyl-coa has been demonstrated to increase erythromycin production, which was achieved by altering the metabolic flux distribution of its different precursors through genetic manipulation  <cit> . the extender unit, methymalonyl-coa, can be derived from different pathways such as carboxylation of propionyl-coa and rearrangement of succinyl-coa. the muta and mutb genes  encode methylmalonyl-coa mutase , which catalyzes the reversible isomerization of succinyl-coa and methymalonyl-coa. reeves et al. have proposed a metabolic model where in carbohydrate-based fermentations mcm acts as a drain on the methylmalonyl-coa metabolite pool, and in oil-based fermentations, mcm acts in the reverse direction to fill the methylmalonyl-coa pool  <cit> . the induction or repression of mutab may elevate or reduce concentrations of methymalonyl-coa to affect the erythromycin synthesis rate depending on the medium. therefore, overproduction of erythromycin was achieved by inactivating the mutb in a carbohydrate-based medium  <cit> , or by duplication of the mcm operon  in an oil-based fermentation medium  <cit> . in this study, the carbon flow under industrial medium condition may be from succinyl-coa to methylmalonyl-coa. improvement of erythromycin production in e <dig> strain could be at least partly attributed to the increase of methylmalonyl-coa pool as a result of the overexpression of mutab genes.

more interestingly, bldd has the same sequences in two strains, and is down-regulated in the overproducing e <dig>  which is contrary to the observation reported by the bldd finder  <cit> , while consistent with a more recent literature  <cit> . other possible regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in s. erythraea are therefore expected.

according to our data, the differential expression between overproducer e <dig> and wild-type nrrl <dig> significantly involved transport of phosphate and nitrogen, and phosphate starvation response and repressive nitrogen-metabolism was observed in e <dig> through entire time-course compared with nrrl <dig> strain. this suggests that the high-level expression of erythromycin biosynthesis pathway probably result from the dysfunction of global regulators sensing stress or nutritional starvation signal, as is known in the signaling system of phop-afsr-afss in s. coelicolor a <dig>  controlling expression of genes involved in p-n nutrition stress response and secondary metabolism  <cit> . afss, a 63-amino-acid sigma-like regulatory protein, was found in streptomycetes including s. coelicolor, s. dividans, s. griseus, and s. noursei. in s. coelicolor, the activation of afss by afsr can further activate the transcription of genes coding for pathway-specific transcription factors, e.g. actii-orf <dig> and moreover, afss, as a crucial master regulator of both antibiotic synthesis and nutritional stress response, also regulates the expression of genes involved in phosphate transport and nitrogen metabolism. the global network of signal transduction cascades and cross-talk of phop and afsr-afss was modeled recently, which controls gene expression involved in p-n balance and secondary metabolism in s. coelicolor <cit> . phop repressed the transcription of nitrogen genes by binding to the promoter of glnr, the major nitrogen regulator, to the promoters of glna and glnii, two glutamine synthetases, and to the promoter of the amtb-glnk-glnd operon, encoding an ammonium transporter  <cit> . it is interesting that the s. erythraea orthologs of these genes and other glnr-regulon genes were significantly down-regulated in strain e <dig>  such as glnr , glnb  encoding the nitrogen regulatory protein pii, amt , glna- <dig>  coding for the glutamine synthetase, ure operons  coding for the urease, nark-nir operon  encoding the assimilatory nitrite reductase and nitrite extrusion protein. the previous works also demonstrated that many genes related to nitrogen metabolism showed lower expression in s. erythraea overproducing strain rif <dig> with s444f mutation in rpob than in impaired strain rif <dig> with q426r mutation  <cit> . in order to investigate if these nitrogen metabolism genes are under the control of phop in s. erythraea, we searched these genes for pho boxes using the model based on the alignment of  <dig> pho dru compiled by blanco et al.  <cit> , and detected one candidate pho box  in the glnr promoter region, and one  in the afsr promoter. however, we failed to find sequences coding afss-like protein in s. erythraea genome. so far the signaling system of phop-afsr-afss, controlling expression of genes involved in p-n nutrition stress response and secondary metabolism in s. erythraea has not been built. our findings suggest the existence of a similar regulation mechanism underlying the erythromycin biosynthesis in s. erythraea .

taken together, it seems that the regulatory mechanism of erythromycin biosynthesis is much more complicated than expected, probably involving more than one global regulator. further function experiments, such as the identification of the regulators and their target genes, the identification of phop-afsr-afss signaling system, will help to elucidate the precise mechanisms. furthermore, the accumulation of genomic and transcriptomic data for more over-producing strains will also help to find out the causal variations which directly contribute to antibiotic production. actually, a comparative genomics and transciptomic profiles of another erythromycin over-producing strain px and nrrl <dig> was released very recently  <cit> . it was found that the genomic variations affect a total of  <dig> proteins of px strain and a quite number of mutations alter key enzymes in the central carbon and nitrogen metabolism and in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which probably results in the redirection of common precursors for erythromycin biosynthesis  <cit> . similar to the current report, it is difficult to sort out the mutations which are directly related to the high production of erythromycin. besides experimental verification, next efforts on the comparison of different overproducers by using advanced data integration techniques will help to generate more insights on the regulation mechanism of erythromycin biosynthesis, and eventually provide valuable information on new strategies for strain improvement.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we sequenced the whole genome of a high-producing s. erythraea strain e <dig> obtained by random mutagenesis and screening from the wild-type strain nrrl <dig>  and examined time-series expression profiles of both e <dig> and nrrl <dig>  based on the genomic data and transcriptpmic data of these two strains, we carried out comparative analysis of high-producing strain and wild-type strain at both the genomic level and the transcriptomic level. a large number of genomic variations, including  <dig> insertions,  <dig> deletions and  <dig> single nucleotide variations  were identified in e <dig> in comparison with nrrl <dig>  and the analysis of time series transcriptomic data indicated that the genes involved in erythromycin biosynthesis and feeder pathways were significantly up-regulated during the 60 hours time-course. according to our data, bldd, a previously identified ery cluster regulator, did not show any positive correlations with the expression of ery cluster, suggesting the existence of alternative regulation mechanisms of erythromycin synthesis in s. erythraea. several potential regulators were then proposed by integration analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data. this functional comparative genomics work represents an important step towards understanding the over-producing mechanism of s. erythraea strain e <dig> on a genomic scale, and provided useful clues to strain engineering for improved production of erythromycin.
