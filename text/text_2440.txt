BACKGROUND
early in the 21st century, fossils of an ancient man who lived 50- <dig> thousand years  ago were found in the denisova cave in the altai mountains  <cit> . the homo sapiens denisova  nuclear genome was first sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and then re-sequenced in  <dig>  <cit> . the homo sapiens neanderthalensis  nuclear genome was first sequenced in  <dig>  <cit>  and for a second time in  <dig>  <cit> . a comparative analysis of the archaic hominine  and homo sapiens sapiens  genomes assessed the genetic contribution of h. s. d. and h. s. n to the genetic and biological profile of the modern h. s. s. populations  <cit> . it was shown that the h. s. n. lineage is a sister lineage to h. s. d.  <cit> . the population split of neanderthals and denisovans from modern humans was estimated to have occurred 550- <dig> ky ago and the split time of neanderthals and denisovans 380- <dig> ky ago  <cit> . considering that the evolution of mirna genes could be one of the key factors in the formation of the modern type of man  <cit> , we analyzed the evolution of mirna genes in h. s. n. and h. s. d. and the expression of their target mrnas. using improved versions of the h. s. d. and h. s. n. genomes, we performed computer-assisted comparisons of the h. s. n., h. s. d. and h. s. s. genomes to reveal the structural and functional organization of micrornas  as well as the mrnas targeted by these mirnas. in both the neanderthal and denisovan genomes, we found mirna genes with fixed substitutions in mature mirnas and multiple substitutions in pre-mirna regions involved in pre-mirna processing.

our analysis of spatiotemporal gene expression in human tissues demonstrated that the mirnas bearing new genetic variants fixed in the denisovan genome regulated target mrnas with the highest levels of expression in the postnatal human brain.

RESULTS
to identify mirna genes that evolved divergently in the genus homo, we first used the map and pre-mirna gene sequence data for  <dig> experimentally confirmed h. s. s. mirnas from the mirbase database rel.  <dig>  <cit> . we selected the h. s. d. and h. s. n. pre-mirnas with highly confident sequences that are orthologous to h. s. s. pre-mirnas. using the selection procedure described in the methods section , we identified  <dig> h. s. d. and  <dig> h. s. n. pre-mirnas perfectly matched to h. s. s. pre-mirna gene sequences. in addition, we identified and selected for further study  <dig> h. s. d. and  <dig> h. s. n. diverged genes for pre-mirna sequences, which were different from h. s. s. pre-mirna genes by at least a single nucleotide. the other  <dig> h. s. d. and  <dig> h. s. n. pre-mirnas did not pass quality sequence control in the selection procedure

further, we explored the alignment of the genomes of six primates available in ensembl rel.  <dig>  <cit> . each of the selected h. s. d. and h. s. n. pre-mirna genes non-identical to h. s. s. orthologs had at least one ortholog in another primate. this result indicated that these pre-mirna coding genes were present in the genome of the common ancestor of h. s. s., h. s. d. and h. s. n. long before the evolutionary split between these hominines. in following up this analysis, we confirmed the existence of orthologs for all selected h. s. d. and h. s. n. mirna genes except one h. s. d. mirna gene.

next, we analyzed all substitutions found in the archaic hominine mirna genes selected as described above. first, we excluded a few doubtful nucleotide substitutions observed in the sequencing data for the pre-mirna genes of h. s. d. and h. s. n. . then, we mapped the remaining genetic variants found in the pre-mirna genes of h. s. d. and h. s. n. onto the secondary structures of the corresponding pre-mirnas in h. s. s. available at the mirbase rel.  <dig>  <cit> . we selected the h. s. d. and h. s. n. pre-mirnas with  nucleotide substitutions  in the regions corresponding to the sequences of mature mirnas  responsible for binding to target mrnas or  multiple  densely spaced substitutions within a pre-mirna region involved in pre-mirna processing. from these pre-mirna groups, we excluded the pre-mirnas that occur in the h. s. s. genome in more than one copy. the aim of this exclusion was to select pre-mirnas with unique functions. the selection yielded h. s. d. and h. s. n. pre-mirnas with nucleotide substitutions that might contribute to significant functional differences from the h. s. s. pre-mirnas.

the functional annotation of the diverged pre-mirna genes in archaic hominines was performed as follows. first, we selected the mirnas expressed in the central nervous system  using the mirgator  <dig>   <cit>  and chip-seq data for h3k4me <dig>  modified histones marking active promoters in primate cortical neurons  <cit> . second, the potential target mrnas of these central nervous system -active mirnas were identified using data from mirgator  <dig>   <cit> . mirgator  <dig>  contains experimental mirna/target-mrnas co-expression data obtained under various conditions. therefore, we extracted from mirgator  <dig>  genes with co-expression correlation coefficient with mirna râ‰¤- <dig>   <cit> . we used the co-expression evidence to identify putative interactions between mirnas and their target mrnas instead of the clip-seq experiments results because the latter technology requires cell lysis, which facilitates the interaction of components that are usually segregated by cellular compartments  <cit> , and many mirna/mrnas interactions identified by clip-seq are non-canonical, which in turn does not mediate repression  <cit> . however, co-expression data indicate pathways  targeted by mirna but do not allow the identification of direct mirna/mrna interactions. the latter has a side advantage because, in this approach, we selected against target genes with limited effect on tissue functioning  <cit> . third, to identify the human brain structures  showing increased levels of the target mrnas , we performed a randomization test using the human allen brain atlas  <cit>  and the brainspan atlas  <cit> . we employed the randomization test for this purpose because the standard analytic annotation enrichment techniques are inapplicable for mirna functional enrichment analysis  <cit> .

the characteristics of the nucleotide substitutions in each of the cns-active pre-mirna genes diverged in denisovan and neanderthal are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  these mirna genes were stratified into four groups. the first group consists of  <dig> mirnas with fixed mutations unique to the h. s. d. lineage. the second group includes  <dig> mirnas with fixed mutations unique to the h. s. n. lineage. two other mirna gene groups were compiled of  <dig> h. s. d. and  <dig> h. s. n. mirna genes bearing variants that match to one of the polymorphic alleles in h. s. s. most polymorphisms in these mirnas are snps . several substitutions are observed in the seed region  in six out of  <dig> h. s. d. and five out of  <dig> h. s. n. pre-mirnas common to human polymorphisms. only one indel in the seed region was observed in hsa-mir- <dig> in both h. s. n. and h. s. d. the minority of mirnas with polymorphisms in the seed region is not sufficient to claim that the general capacity of these mirna pools have altered binding specificity to target mrnas. this result allowed us to use the third and fourth pools as a control to compare the target specificities with mirna bearing fixed variants specific for h. s. n. and h. s. d.

next, we searched for the brain regions and cns development stage showing the most abundant expression of mrnas targeted by the mirnas that diverged in archaic hominines . for this purpose, we used data in  the brainspan exon microarray   <cit>  and  the allen human brain atlas as updated march  <dig>   <dig>   <cit> .

the results of the analysis of brainspan data  <cit>  demonstrated that mrnas targeted by mirnas bearing fixed mutations specific for h. s. d. are enriched in the postnatal stage of brain development, whereas mrnas targeted by mirnas bearing fixed mutations specific for h. s. n. are most abundant in the prenatal brain . in contrast, no development stage-dependent expression was found for mrnas targeted by mirnas matched to polymorphic variants in h. s. s. . thus, we can anticipate the differential effect of genetic variations found in archaic hominines on brain function and development in denisovans and neanderthals. the effects are not likely to be due to bias in the number of mrna targets. the number of targeted genes is similar between mirnas bearing fixed mutations specific for h. s. n. and h. s. d. :  <dig> target genes for h. s. n. and  <dig> for h. s. d. . in addition, the number of targeted genes is similar between h. s. n. and h. s. d. mirnas matched to polymorphic variants in h. s. s. :  <dig> target genes for h. s. n. and  <dig> for h. s. d. it is interesting that the highest expression of transcripts targeted by mirnas with polymorphisms unique for h. s. d. is confined to the broad thalamus regions and the prefrontal cortex . nevertheless, there are multiple forebrain regions known to be important for speech that exhibit higher expression of mirna targets from the set with polymorphisms unique for h. s. d. : the inferiolateral temporal cortex, medial and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. it is of interest that the thalamus plays a significant role in the shaping of the human language-ready brain  <cit> .

in contrast, when we consider mirnas of ancient humans expressed in the central nervous system and having variants shared with known human polymorphisms, the picture changes drastically : all brain structures are targeted more by polymorphic h. s. n. mirnas than by polymorphic h. s. d. mirnas. the larger signal in h. s. n., shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  is likely due to a higher number of mirnas expressed in the central nervous system and sharing variation with the human population for h. s. n.  than for h. s. d. . considering common mirnas sharing human polymorphisms in these organisms , the specific numbers are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively ). given that the largest number of gene targets was found for the polymorphic hsa-mir- <dig>  mirna  in h. s. n., this difference between the two hominine subspecies can be attributed to this particular mirna.

the fine target structures identified using ahba data for gene expression in the left hemisphere of the brain  <cit>  are presented in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  for identification of the fine target brain structures, we used the difference in regulatory potential between the h. s. d. and h. s. n. samples  as a marker . importantly , the difference between the target structures of unique h. s. d. and h. s. n. mirnas expressed in the central nervous system tissues is not significant  for all fine brain structures except two: the fusiform gyrus for h. s. d. mirnas and the precentral gyrus for h. s. n. mirnas. the picture obtained based on the target mrnas for mirnas expressed in the central nervous system tissues with known human polymorphisms  is the same : for the vast majority of fine brain structures, the difference between targeting by h. s. d. and h. s. n. is not significant, except for two thalamus structures and the lateral orbital gyrus, targeted by h. s. d. mirnas. it is important that the fusiform and lateral orbital gyri are responsible for face perception and socialization, respectively  <cit> . taken together, these findings indicate an important role of unique h. s. d. mirnas in the development of specific brain structures in denisovans, which likely enabled them to reach an unparalleled level of craftsmanship  <cit> .

in addition to the identification of target brain structures for h. s. d. and h. s. n. mirna activity, we found highly enriched functional categories of target gene annotations. we used the david  <dig>  functional annotation system  <cit>  and the sp_pir_keywords data class, with genes expressed in the human brain as background . the results of the functional enrichment test are shown in table  <dig>  the most important difference between the target genes for unique h. s. d. and h. s. n. mirnas expressed in the central nervous system tissues is the transport category enriched in target genes of h. s. d. mirnas. similar observations can be made considering mirnas expressed in central nervous system tissues with substitutions shared with known human polymorphisms: "functional response" categories  enriched in target genes of h. s. d. and the developmental category enriched in target genes of such h. s. n. mirnas. it would be reasonable to speculate that that the evolutionary changes in mirna-transregulators might contribute to alterations in functional activities in specific brain regions in denisovans, whereas in neanderthals, the mutations in mirnas could promote alterations in brain development and structure.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identified mirna genes of archaic humans bearing sequence variations in comparison with the modern human genome sequence:  <dig> genes for h. s. d. and  <dig> genes for h. s. n. almost one-third of those genes contain variations specific for archaic humans . the analysis of human gene expression data resulted in  <dig> h. s. d. and  <dig> h. s. n. genes with specific archaic variations and the expression of their human orthologs in the central nervous system.

the detailed analysis of the human brain gene expression data demonstrated that the brain regions with the most abundant expression of mrnas targeted by the h. s. d. mirnas with fixed mutations are confined to the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex , no large brain regions are targeted by h. s. n. mirnas with specific mutations. the only small brain regions targeted by h. s. n. mirnas with such mutations are the superior lateral aspect and the central sulcus of the precentral gyrus.

we identified differences in gene expression pattern during human brain development for the targets of human orthologs for the selected mirnas. targets for mirna genes with mutations specific for h. s. d. were expressed predominantly in the later prenatal and early postnatal development stages. targets for mirnas with mutations specific for h. s. n. were expressed predominantly in early prenatal brain development stages. these results may reflect a potential association between the changes in the denisovan mirna genes reported in this study and the brain development of h. s. d., which likely allowed them to reach their high level of craftsmanship.
