BACKGROUND
the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe provides an attractive model system for studying cellular differentiation processes in response to environmental cues. it is a unicellular, haploid organism with a conventionally organized cell cycle  <cit> , and it is easily subjected to genetic analysis  <cit> . furthermore, since its entire genome sequence is known  <cit> , genome-wide analysis tools can be readily applied.

in response to nitrogen starvation fission yeast cells undergo sexual differentiation. in this process haploid p and m cells first mate to form dipoid zygotes  <cit> , which then undergo meiosis and sporulation  <cit> . nitrogen starvation leads to the establishment of a pheromone signalling system by which m and p cells communicate with each other , causing growth arrest in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle. pairs of g <dig> arrested m- and p- cells subsequently agglutinate, mate, and undergo karyogamy, after which the resulting diploid zygotes enter meiosis and finally sporulate.

the hmg-box transcription factor ste <dig> is a master regulator of the sexual differentiation programme  <cit> . upon starvation, ste <dig> activates numerous genes required for mating and meiosis, including the mat genes specifying cellular mating type, many genes encoding components of the pheromone communication system, and mei <dig> that encodes the ultimate activator of meiosis. ste <dig> binds to one or several ste11-sites  present in the promoter regions of the genes it directly controls.

the two pheromones are small, secreted peptides that bind to and activate cell-type specific 7tm receptors on the cell surface , thereby activating the receptor-coupled g-protein, gpa <dig>  this stimulates a map kinase cascade, consisting of byr <dig> , byr <dig>  and spk <dig> . the pheromone response, which is shared by the two cell types, activates genes required at various steps throughout the differentiation process, with entry into meiosis being the most downstream event reported to rely on the signal  <cit> .

several lines of evidence suggest that ste <dig> is also the transcription factor activated by pheromone signalling. pheromone-controlled genes often have ste11-boxes in their promoter regions, and hyper-activation of the map2k byr <dig> causes constitutive activation of ste <dig>  <cit> . spk <dig> can in fact directly phosphorylate ste <dig> on threonines  <dig> and  <dig> in vitro, and mutational analysis of these residues in vivo is consistent with a direct activation mechanism  <cit> . however, since ste <dig> is absolutely required for the expression of many components in the response pathway, it is difficult to evaluate whether pheromone signalling can stimulate transcription in the absence of ste <dig> 

the analysis of pheromone-controlled transcription is further complicated by the nutritional control over the differentiation pathway. in order to make them respond to mating pheromones, it is necessary to starve cells for nitrogen, which in itself causes dramatic changes in the expression of many genes  <cit> . furthermore, the transcriptional responses to nitrogen starvation and pheromone stimulation are partially overlapping, and ste11-controlled genes appear to be induced to varying degrees by both these environmental cues . some genes, such as ste <dig>  <cit>  are already strongly induced by nitrogen starvation and become further enhanced by pheromone . expression of other genes like fus <dig>  <cit>  has an absolute requirement for both nitrogen starvation and pheromone signalling . genetic analysis has shown that byr <dig>  byr <dig> and ste <dig> are required for induction of pheromone controlled genes by nitrogen starvation  <cit> , suggesting that this signal is also conveyed by the pheromone-responding mapk pathway.

an additional layer of regulation is conferred by cellular mating type. whilst most pheromone-controlled genes appear to be equally expressed in the two cell types, a small subset is either m-specific  or p-specific . these genes are involved in synthesis and processing of the cell-type specific extracellular components of the pheromone-communication system, i.e. the pheromones and receptors. their expression is controlled by the allele present at the mat <dig> locus of the cell  <cit> . in m cells the mat1-mc gene causes activation of m-specific genes, while the mat1-pc gene activates p-specific genes in p cells. mat1-mc is an hmg-box protein that appears to recruit ste <dig> to a weaker version of its binding site  present in the promoter region of m-specific genes  <cit> . the mechanism by which mat1-pc activates the p-specific genes is less clear. genetic analysis suggests that it cooperates with the map <dig> protein, a putative transcription factor of the mads-box family  <cit> .

in the present study we use genomic microarrays to identify pheromone-induced genes in fission yeast. in order to discriminate pheromone-induction from the effect of nitrogen starvation, we utilize the fact that cyr <dig> strains defective in camp production are derepressed for mating activities, and hence respond to pheromone without being starved  <cit> . we have identified classes of genes induced by m-factor in p cells and genes induced by p-factor in m-cells. as expected, these two groups of genes were highly overlapping. moreover, a direct comparison of m and p cells allowed us to identify several new genes that are either m- or p-specific. our results support the notion that ste <dig> is the major transcription factor bringing about pheromone-stimulated transcription.

RESULTS
identification of genes induced by m- and p-factor
in order to characterize the changes in transcription profiles caused by mating pheromone stimulation, we performed two different experiments; one where we added m-factor to h+cyr <dig> cells, and a second adding p-factor to h-cyr <dig> sxa <dig> cells. the cyr <dig> mutation was included in both strains in order to enable pheromone stimulation without first subjecting the cells to nitrogen starvation  <cit> . furthermore, the h- strain was inactivated in the sxa <dig> gene, which encodes a very potent p-factor degrading protease  <cit> .

we took samples for rna preparation after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours from both cultures. total rna from each time point was hybridised to genomic arrays using the  <dig> hour time point from the same mating type as a reference. the complete data set is available from the gene expression omnibus database . analysis of the data showed that pheromone treatment caused dramatic induction of a relatively large number of genes. k-means cluster analysis of these genes revealed that most genes were already induced after  <dig> hours of pheromone stimulation, and that their expression remained high for the duration of the experiment , suggesting that pheromone induction occurred rapidly. for each pheromone, we therefore identified genes that were consistently induced more than twofold at all three time-points after pheromone addition. using these criteria, we identified  <dig> m-factor induced genes and  <dig> p-factor induced genes . a direct comparison revealed that most pheromone-induced genes were expressed at similar levels in untreated h+ and h- cells .

comparison of the sets of m-factor and p-factor induced gene lists showed that they were highly overlapping, containing many genes in common. this is consistent with the fact that the pheromone response pathway is common to both mating types, and most of the proteins required in the differentiation pathway perform similar functions in the two cell types. to analyse the similarity of the responses further we compared the m-factor and p-factor induced changes for both sets of induced genes. figure  <dig> shows that the fold change values for m- and p- treatment are highly correlated for most genes. most of the minority of genes that are less well correlated still show a tendency to induction under both conditions.

pheromone-induced genes
the list identified by our array experiments contained genes such as bqt <dig>  fus <dig> and rep <dig> previously demonstrated to be pheromone controlled, but also many new genes . to investigate the function of the pheromone induced genes further, we identified gene ontolology  categories that were significantly associated with m-factor and p-factor induced genes .

as expected, genes involved in conjugation were enriched in both m-factor and p-factor induced genes. in addition, we found genes such as spk <dig> ste <dig> and ste <dig> encoding proteins directly involved in response to pheromone.

other functions, specifically involved in the morphological alterations observed during mating, were also enriched among the pheromone-induced genes. these included glucan catabolism, cytoskeleton-dependent intracellular transport, and microtubule-mediated nuclear migration and nucleus localization. presumably, the induction by pheromone of a specific subset of genes involved in these processes redirects them to accommodate their specific behaviour during differentiation.

the mat1-pm and mat1-mm genes required for entry into meiosis are the most downstream functions so far reported to be pheromone controlled  <cit> . it was therefore of interest to find gene categories performing specific meiotic functions that lie further downstream  among the up-regulated genes. genes in these categories include the meiotic master regulator mei <dig> and the meiotic forkhead transcription factor mei <dig> but our results also identify new potential regulators such as the putative forkhead transcription factor . finally, a relatively large group of genes belonging to the categories meiotic recombination and meiotic gene conversion were found to be pheromone induced. these include dmc <dig>  eme <dig>  rad <dig>  rad <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rec <dig>  rti <dig> and swi <dig> 

validation and functional characterization
to confirm that the newly identified genes were actually pheromone controlled, we performed real-time rcr analysis on several of them . in order to do this, we did the pheromone stimulation with cyr1+ cells that were also starved for nitrogen. this allowed us not only to validate the results in a different genetic background, but also to evaluate the inducibility by nitrogen starvation of the pheromone-induced genes. as an example, figure 4a shows the analysis of the gene spbc <dig> , which was strongly induced by both pheromones in the array experiment. the real-time pcr data showed that this gene was already induced by nitrogen starvation, and confirmed that its expression was further elevated by pheromone addition in both mating types, leading to a more than  <dig> fold induction in total.

spbc <dig>  encodes a sequence orphan with no homologs in other organisms. in order to examine whether the gene was required for sexual differentiation, we disrupted the gene. as judged by iodine starvation, elimination of spbc <dig>  indeed caused a dramatic defect in the ability of cells to undergo sporulation , as both the rate of entry into differentiation and the final level of sporulation were strongly reduced. microscopic examination revealed that the disrupted strain was defective in both cell fusion and spore formation . in contrast, loss of spbc <dig>  did not seem to affect mitotic cell growth severely . in conclusion, the array data allowed us to identify novel pheromone-induced genes involved in sexual differentiation. furthermore, the real-time pcr confirmed their regulation by pheromone, and demonstrated that such genes could also be induced by nitrogen starvation alone.

pheromone controlled genes have an elevated occurrence of putative ste <dig> binding sites
as outlined above, several lines of evidence suggest that ste <dig> is the transcription factor activated in response to pheromone signalling. we therefore asked whether the pheromone-controlled genes identified by our array study had ste <dig> binding sites in their promoter regions. the number of putative ste <dig> binding sites as well as the sequence and position of the best putative site are provided in additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> shows that ste <dig> binding sites within  <dig> bp upstream of the atg start codon are about four-fold more frequent in pheromone-regulated genes than in other genes. ste <dig> sites are also found further upstream but their frequency gradually drops towards a background level of about 2%. this background level is also seen for the remaining genes in the genome that are not included in our pheromone-induced set. for these genes the background level is fairly constant showing only a slight increase in the - <dig> to - <dig> region. thus the increase in the frequency of ste <dig> sites in the pheromone-induced genes appears to be specific. we conclude that the frequency of ste <dig> binding sites is highly enriched in the promoters of pheromone-regulated genes, consistent with the notion that ste <dig> is the major transcriptional regulator involved in their induction.

identification of cell-type specific genes
as mentioned in the introduction, the m- and p-specific genes controlled by the mat <dig> locus are also induced by pheromone. we therefore sought to identify cell-type specific genes by looking for transcripts that were differentially induced by the two mating pheromones. we hybridised the two rna preparations obtained after  <dig> hours of m-factor and p-factor stimulation to the same array, and selected transcripts that had a more than  <dig> fold difference in expression levels. by these criteria we identified 8- m-specific and  <dig> p-specific genes . we confirmed that these genes were selectively induced by either m-factor or p-factor in the array time course described above . in table  <dig> we have summarized current knowledge on functions and expression patterns of the cell-type specific genes in fission yeast.

m-specific genes
the m-specific transcripts included  <dig> genes previously described to encode m-specific mating functions ; the remaining known m-specific genes  are all very short and are not present on the arrays we used. three new genes  were identified, and we confirmed all three to be m-specific by real-time pcr on rna from cyr1+ control cells .

the first gene, mam <dig>  is annotated to encode the m cell agglutinin  <cit> , and hence, its expression was expected to be m-cell specific. the second gene, cwp <dig> encodes the α-subunit of the enzyme geranyl-gernyl transferase i   <cit> , and its induction by m-factor presumably reflects its role in farnesylation of m-factor  <cit> . analogous to the cwg <dig> gene encoding the β-subunit of ggtase i  <cit> , we presume that cwp <dig> is an essential gene, and we have not evaluated its involvement in m-factor production. consistent with a role of cwp <dig> in other cellular processes, its expression does not have an absolute requirement for m-specific pheromone stimulation .

the third gene, 11h <dig> , encodes a hypothetical protein that is conserved in eukaryotes. interestingly, this gene is divergently transcribed from the same promoter region as the m-specific gene mam <dig>  and we speculate that the two genes are co-regulated. this gene is also expressed at a relatively high level in p-cells , and we have not analysed its involvement in mating activities of m-cells.

with these findings, the total number of known m-specific genes is  <dig>  in table  <dig> we have aligned their promoter sequences upstream of their ste11-box. except for mam <dig> all the m-specific genes contain imperfect ste11-boxes  to which ste <dig> only binds in the presence of mat1-mc  <cit> . mam <dig> contains a perfect ste11-box  to which ste <dig> can bind on its own and consistent with this mam <dig> is not strictly m-specific, as it is expressed in both cell types, albeit 2– <dig> fold higher in m cells . similar to the strict m-specific genes, mam <dig> also harbours an m-box  14– <dig> bp upstream of the ste11-box , which presumably boosts its expression in m cells.

p-specific genes
apart from the two mating-type genes mat1-pc and mat1-pm  only two p-specific genes have been described, namely map <dig> and map <dig>  encoding, respectively p-factor and the receptor for m-factor. both these genes were selectively induced by m-factor in our arrays . the map <dig> gene encoding p-cell specific agglutinin  <cit>  was not identified by our array approach, but real-time pcr analysis showed that its expression indeed was p-specific . the two additional p-specific genes identified in the arrays , were analysed further. spac <dig>  was confirmed to be p-specific by real-time pcr analysis , and hence represents a new bona fide p-specific gene. however, disruption of spac <dig>  had no obvious effect on mating of p-cells , leaving the reason for its p-specific regulation unexplained.

the other p-specific gene, spac3f <dig> , represented a puzzle. its sequence suggests that it encodes an enzyme homologous to s. cerevisiae his <dig>  and hence it is likely to be involved in histidine biosynthesis; yet real-time pcr analysis confirmed that its expression was highly induced by pheromone in a p-cell specific manner . we therefore sought alternative explanations for its apparent p-cell specific expression pattern. we noticed that this gene is partially overlapping with the p-specific gene map <dig> . the two genes are convergently transcribed, and their reading frames overlap by  <dig> codons. hence, we speculated that the array spots for spac3f <dig>  might have picked up the map3-specific signal from the opposite strand. in order to test this hypothesis, we did strand-specific rt-pcr with the same two spac3f <dig>  primers that were used to generate the pcr product constituting the array spots . indeed, the p-specific, pheromone-induced transcript originates from the map3-specific strand. the spac3f <dig>  specific transcript from the opposite strand gives rise to a somewhat smaller pcr product due to the splicing out of the  <dig> bases long third intron in the gene . curiously, this transcript seemed to be down-regulated when map <dig> was induced by pheromone, suggesting that strong transcription in the opposite direction can negatively affect gene expression. consistent with the array data, we mapped the 3'-end of the map <dig> mrna to the sequence 5'-acatccgaga-3' in the second intron of spac3f <dig>  .

discussion
in fission yeast, nitrogen starvation causes induction of gene expression by at least three different signalling pathways. first, it leads to a modest reduction in cellular camp, which in turn down regulates the glucose sensing pka <dig> protein kinase that directly represses transcription of genes such as fbp <dig> and ste <dig>  <cit> . secondly, nitrogen starvation activates the spc1/sty <dig> stress response pathway  <cit> , which causes induction of the atf <dig> transcription factor that also controls ste <dig>  <cit> . finally, genetic analysis suggests that the pheromone-responding mapk pathway conveys the signal of nitrogen starvation to pheromone controlled promoters  <cit> .

in the present study we have used a cyr <dig> genetic background to separate pheromone-induced transcription from the general effects of nitrogen starvation. consequently, we found that pheromone stimulation of cyr <dig> cells caused a much less dramatic change in expression profiles than nitrogen starvation of wild-type cells  <cit> . by this approach we have identified a total of  <dig> genes that were more than two-fold induced by pheromone stimulation, including several genes previously reported to be pheromone controlled.

among the pheromone-induced genes we found the camp degrading phosphodiesterase cgs <dig>  suggesting that pheromone signalling enforces the reduction in camp caused by nitrogen starvation  <cit> . this gene was also shown to be induced by activation of the spc1/sty <dig> stress response pathway  <cit> , suggesting that cgs <dig> constitutes a junction for cross talk between different starvation sensing pathways. when camp levels drop, the apc/c e <dig> ubiquitin ligase becomes activated  <cit> , and this causes g <dig> arrest via degradation of the s-phase activating cyclin cig <dig>  <cit> . consistent with an increased apc/c activity during differentiation, we found apc <dig> encoding a subunit of apc/c among the pheromone-induced genes.

our identification of components in the pheromone signal transduction pathway  suggests that initial pheromone stimulation triggers a positive feedback loop enforcing the response. furthermore, the whi <dig> gene, whose counterpart in s. cerevisiae encodes an inhibitor of transcriptional activities required for vegetative s-phase entry  <cit> , was among the induced genes, suggesting that pheromone signalling inhibits vegetative growth. taken together these observations underscore the autocatalytic and irreversible nature of the developmental switch.

on the other hand, functions that dampen the pheromone response were also identified. thus, the msa <dig> gene encoding an rna-binding protein that negatively regulates differentiation specific transcripts  <cit> , and rgs <dig> coding for a gtpase that down-regulates the receptor-coupled g-protein gpa <dig>  <cit>  were both pheromone induced, stressing the importance of a tight modulation of the response during differentiation.

the results presented here are consistent with ste <dig> being the transcription factor activated by pheromone signalling. the pheromone-regulated genes in figure  <dig> contain perfect matches to a matrix constructed from known sites and they together account for about 30% of the pheromone-induced transcripts. the remaining pheromone-regulated genes almost invariably contain more diverged derivatives of the ste11-binding site, often in multiple copies. it is thus likely that ste <dig> regulates the majority of pheromone-regulated genes, perhaps in some cases via co-operative binding to a number of relatively weak binding sites as previously reported  <cit> . it is, however, likely that some pheromone-regulated genes are indirectly induced by other transcription factors, either alone or in combination with ste <dig>  indeed, several transcription factors such as rep <dig> and mei <dig> are found within the group of pheromone-induced genes.

the isp <dig> gene, which we found to be pheromone induced, was actually reported to be induced by nitrogen starvation independently of ste <dig>  <cit> , and it does not have an obvious ste11-box in its promoter region . the camp pathway negatively regulates isp <dig> transcription  <cit> , and presumably the pheromone effect on this gene is caused indirectly by cross talk with other signalling pathways as discussed above.

the cig <dig> gene, encoding an s-phase activating cyclin, is specifically expressed in the g <dig> phase of the cell cycle  <cit> , and hence its induction by pheromone could be an indirect consequence of pheromone-mediated g <dig> arrest however, the cig <dig> promoter contains a perfect ste11-box , suggesting that ste <dig> and the pheromone pathway may also directly control this gene. the regulation of cig <dig> represents a paradox: transcription of the gene is on the one hand induced by pheromone, yet the same signal also mediates proteolysis of the cig <dig> protein  <cit> . presumably this regulation reflects the fact that cig <dig> needs to be down-regulated in order to activate the differentiation pathway, but then cig <dig> is needed again soon after for activation of pre-meiotic s-phase  <cit> .

by comparing the effects of m- and p-factor stimulation we were able to identify p-and m-specific genes. given the extensive hunt over many years for cell-type specific mutants, it was no surprise that we only found very few new genes, and an important conclusion of this work is that the list in table  <dig> can be regarded, as close to being complete. the larger number of m-specific genes largely reflects the more elaborate synthesis of m-factor relative to p-factor.

our results confirm the proposed mechanism of m-specific gene activation  <cit> , where the mat1-mc protein both recruits ste <dig> to a weak binding site and also binds to an m-box sequence situated approximately  <dig>  or  <dig>  helical turns upstream of the ste11-box . the control of p-specific transcription is still an enigma that awaits functional promoter dissection studies to be resolved.

our observation that the p-specific transcript map <dig> extends into the neighbouring gene spac3f <dig>  demonstrates the importance of mapping the genome-wide location of transcripts and the use of this information in the design of future dna microarrays. using a different array system, spac3f <dig>  was reported to be induced in meiosis  <cit> , presumably also reflecting an erroneous detection of map <dig> transcripts transcribed from the opposite strand. convergent overlapping reading frames are relatively rare in the fission yeast genome, but our finding that the map <dig> transcript extends more than  <dig> bases downstream of the reading frame suggests that convergent transcripts may overlap even when the reading frames do not.

we also found  <dig> genes that were more than twofold down regulated by both pheromones . go categories representing nucleotide and amino acid metabolism were significantly over-represented among these genes, suggesting that specific mechanism exist either to repress these genes or degrade their transcripts during differentiation.

pheromone communication in fungi was originally considered to be a mechanism by which cells of opposite mating type identified each other, but subsequent studies have demonstrated that it controls many other functions than mere cell recognition. in fission yeast pheromone signalling brings about g <dig> cell-cycle arrest prior to mating, cell elongation towards the partner cell, and is also involved in cell fusion and karyogamy. finally, it has been known for a decade that entry into meiosis also requires activation of the pheromone pathway. this is because the two meiotic subfunctions mat1-pm and mat1-mm are pheromone controlled; if they are expressed from a heterologous promoter, meiosis is readily activated in the absence of pheromone signalling  <cit> . our results in the present study show that – although dispensable for completion of meiosis – pheromone control extends beyond the point of meiotic entry. thus, several genes required for specific meiotic sub-functions in particular for meiotic recombination turned out being pheromone induced. consistent with this, expression of the dmc <dig> gene encoding a reca like helicase was previously shown to be dependent on ste <dig>  <cit> . however, we note that many of these genes do not have optimal ste <dig> binding sites in their promoters , suggesting that their induction by pheromone may be indirect. nevertheless, it is evident from our array results that pheromone stimulation in itself can bring about a robust induction of these genes.

previously, the bqt <dig> gene mediating telomere clustering prior to meiotic horsetail movement was shown to be pheromone induced  <cit> . these nuclear movements are already initiated in haploid cells challenged with pheromone  <cit> . we found that dhc <dig> and dic <dig>  encoding dynein heavy and intermediate chains respectively were both pheromone induced. dynein is required for the horsetail movements, and a null mutant in dhc <dig> significantly reduces meiotic recombination  <cit> . furthermore, the dynein-associated ssm <dig> protein is also pheromone regulated  <cit>  and this study). taken together, these observations suggest that pheromone signalling orchestrates the entire process of pre-meiotic chromosome movement and associated recombination. it will be interesting to learn whether oscillations in pheromone signalling play a dynamic role in bringing about these processes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified  <dig> pheromone induced genes in fission yeast. most genes are induced by pheromone in both cell types, and analysis of go annotations associated with pheromone induction showed that the genes were involved in many aspects of sexual differentiation, including conjugation, and morphological processes associated with mating. surprisingly, many meiotic gene functions were also pheromone controlled. our results confirmed that the ste <dig> transcription factor controls many pheromone-induced genes. finally, most cell-type specific genes now appear to be identified in fission yeast.
