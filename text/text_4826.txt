BACKGROUND
salad dishes are cold ready-to-eat  dishes that typically contain raw cuts of vegetables as well as other cooked and smoked ingredients. as salads contain large portions of raw ingredients and their preparation involves extensive handling processes, they are exposed to a higher risk of microbial contamination than other ready-to-eat dishes which are mostly cooked. although no major outbreaks associated with salads have been reported in singapore, there are numerous reports on outbreaks worldwide associated with salad vegetables and salad dishes contaminated with pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, shigella sonnei, salmonella spp. and escherichia coli o157: h <dig> . ingredients used in salad dishes can be contaminated through various routes along the supply chain. for instance, fresh produce can be contaminated through dirty irrigation water, soil or poor hygiene practices during harvesting  <cit> . at the processing plants, the use of unclean water for washing, in chill tanks or as shipping ice can also result in the contamination of fresh produce  <cit> . at the retail level, cross-contamination and bacterial growth can occur due to improper segregation of utensils for handling raw and cooked ingredients, poor hygiene practices or inadequate chilling  <cit> . thus, it is of public health interest to assess the microbial safety and quality of rte salad dishes sold at retail.

according to singapore’s national surveillance statistics  <cit> , the annual incidence of polyclinic attendances due to acute diarrhoea was about  <dig> % of the population in  <dig> and 2012; the annual incidence of food poisoning outbreaks  were  <dig>  and  <dig> per  <dig>  populations respectively  <cit> . during outbreak investigations between  <dig> and  <dig>  s. aureus was identified to be the most common foodborne organism detected in food samples; salmonella spp. was the most frequently encountered pathogen in stool samples of cases  <cit> . while cases of campylobacteriosis, cholera, hepatitis a, hepatitis e, paratyphoid, typhoid and salmonellosis are legally notified by medical doctors and diagnostic laboratories, symptom-based notifications are also received from the medical community and from the public through various channels such as government hotlines and emails  <cit> . among the notifiable diseases, non-typhoidal salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis have shown an increasing incidence in singapore over the years .

in this study, we aimed to assess the microbial safety and quality of retail salads sold in singapore through the sampling of pre-packed salads and salad bar ingredients. l. monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and e. coli o157:h <dig> were screened for in samples collected in this study as these pathogens were previously detected in salad vegetables or salad dishes in other countries . poultry-containing samples were screened additionally for the presence of campylobacter spp. as human campylobacteriosis is largely linked to undercooked or improperly handled poultry items  <cit> . similarly, seafood-containing samples were screened for the presence of v. cholerae and v. parahaemolyticus as human infections caused by these pathogens are mostly associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked seafood items  <cit> . hygiene indicators including non-pathogenic e. coli, s. aureus and b. cereus were also tested for to make inference on the occurrence of hygiene lapses during food preparation. while non-pathogenic e. coli is generally used as an indicator for undercooking, faecal and/or post-cooking contamination; s. aureus is used as an indicator for poor hand hygiene; b. cereus as an indicator for time-temperature abuse during storage  <cit> .

due to the detection of a high prevalence of l. monocytogenes in smoked salmon from salad bars, the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed smoked salmon distributed at local supermarkets was also investigated. in addition, smoked salmon products of a particular brand were collected annually for another  <dig> years to monitor the presence of persistent l. monocytogenes strains. findings gathered from this study are important to identify potential health risks that could arise from consuming salads and to determine measures for improving retail food hygiene and safety. to our knowledge, this is the first report on the microbial safety and quality of rte pre-packed salad dishes and salad bar ingredients sold in singapore.

methods
collection of food samples
there were three phases of sampling in this study. phase i was a survey on the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed salads and salad bar ingredients sold at retail food establishments. phase ii was a survey on the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed smoked salmon sold at supermarkets. phase iii was an extension of phase ii sampling of a brand of products  which was shown to be contaminated by l. monocytogenes st <dig> and st <dig> in multiple batches of pre-packed smoked salmon over a 1-year period. phase iii served to gather preliminary evidence to prompt further investigation upstream to address a suspected contamination problem associated with the repeated detection of st <dig> and st <dig> in brand a products over another 3-year period.

phase i comprised the sampling of  <dig> pre-packed salads and  <dig> salad bar ingredients across singapore between september  <dig> and january  <dig>  pre-packed salads, which included vegetable salads , chicken salads  as well as pasta, rice and couscous salads , were purchased from  <dig> retail food shops. thirty-seven packets of dressing sold with the pre-packed salad samples were analysed separately. six types of salad bar ingredients, which included seafood , dressing , pasta, rice and couscous , vegetable , poultry and eggs  and cheese  samples were purchased from  <dig> salad bars. premises were identified through crowd sourcing websites on local retail food and beverage businesses that were known to be salad bars or known to sell rte pre-packed salad dishes. a minimum sample size of  <dig> was targeted for each type of pre-packed salad or salad bar ingredient for statistical comparison. this is to achieve a level of confidence of more than 80%, with the assumptions that the population is infinite and the prevalence of each foodborne pathogen is 50% . the number of samples collected was spread across the various parts of singapore; products of popular brands and those commonly available to the public were sampled. descriptions of ingredients in pre-packed salads and the breakdown of salad bar ingredients collected in this study were provided in additional file 1: table s <dig> and s <dig> respectively.

phase ii consisted of the sampling of  <dig> pre-packed smoked salmon samples between december  <dig> and september  <dig>  this is to achieve a level of confidence of more than 95%, with the assumptions that the population is infinite and the prevalence of l. monocytogenes is about 87% - the prevalence of l. monocytogenes observed in smoked salmon at salad bars. seventeen brands  of smoked salmon samples were purchased from  <dig> supermarkets. at each supermarket, one sample was taken from each brand, each product variety  and each batch which was available during the time of sampling. thus, more samples were collected from brands with wider varieties of flavoured smoked salmon products, as well as from those with multiple batches on display. based on information declared on the packaging of pre-packed smoked salmon, the countries of origin of salmon were australia, chile, denmark, ireland, korea, new zealand, norway and scotland; the countries of salmon processing were australia, denmark, france, korea, malaysia, new zealand, norway, scotland, singapore, sweden and the philippines.

phase iii consisted of the sampling of pre-packed salmon sashimi samples  in  <dig>  pre-packed smoked salmon samples  in  <dig> and pre-packed salmon sashimi sample  in  <dig> from brand a. these  <dig> samples were analysed for the presence of l. monocytogenes and persistent sequence types detected in phase ii. the sample size was small as the intention was to provide some preliminary evidence to prompt for further investigation at the food manufacturing site.

all pre-packed samples were purchased in their original packaging, whereas the individual salad bar ingredients were collected in sterile bags. all samples were transported on ice, kept refrigerated in the laboratory and analysed within  <dig> h from the time of purchase.

microbiological analyses
microbiological analyses involving the use of pre-enriched sample aliquots
ten grams of each sample were homogenised with  <dig> ml of universal pre-enrichment broth  using a stomacher  with a paddle speed of  <dig> rpm for  <dig> s. the pre-enriched aliquots were used for the determination of standard plate count , e. coli and s. aureus counts according to methods previously described  <cit> . additional tests were performed to determine bacillus cereus and l. monocytogenes counts as well as the presence of extended spectrum β-lactamase producing e. coli strains as outlined below. 
bacillus cereus count




one hundred microlitres of each serial diluted pre-enriched aliquot  were plated onto mannitol egg yolk polymyxin agar  and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h. presumptive pink colonies with opaque zones were confirmed by observing the absence of crystal toxins in bacterial stains using a published method  <cit> , which involved the use of  <dig> % coomassie blue dye  in 50% acetic acid . 
listeria monocytogenes count




one millilitre of each serial diluted pre-enriched aliquot  was plated onto palcam agar  and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h. presumptive grey-green colonies surrounded by dark halos on palcam agar were picked for further confirmation by morphology using chromidtm ottaviani agosti agar  and biochemically using rapidec® lmono  following the manufacturer’s instructions. the level of contamination was quantified only for those collected during the latter part of this study upon noticing an unexpectedly high prevalence of l. monocytogenes in smoked salmon samples. those samples included seven of the positive smoked salmon samples collected from salad bars , and  <dig> positive pre-packed smoked salmon samples obtained from supermarkets . extended spectrum β-lactamase producing escherichia coli strains




upon the quantification of e. coli count using a previously described method involving pre-enriched aliquots  <cit> , the isolates were streaked onto brilliance esbl agar  and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h for the detection of extended spectrum β-lactamase producing strains.

microbiological analyses using post-enriched sample aliquots
the remaining upb aliquots were incubated and enriched at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h for the detection of e. coli o157: h <dig>  l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. using previously described methods  <cit>  with additional tests performed to detect for the presence of v. cholerae and v. parahaemolyticus outlined below. the effective use of upb for simultaneous enrichment of pathogens was demonstrated in several studies ; the evaluation of upb as a suitable sample suspension-and-enrichment medium for this study was described in additional file 2: appendix s <dig> and figure s <dig>  a portion of the food sample was also kept separately for the testing of campylobacter spp. using method as follows. 
vibrio cholerae and vibrio parahaemolyticus





the screening of v. cholerae and v. parahaemolyticus was conducted only on pre-packed seafood salad dishes, seafood salad bar ingredients and pre-packed smoked salmon using the post-enriched aliquots. a  <dig> μl-loopful of the post-enriched culture in upb was sub-cultured onto thiosulfate-citrate-bile salt-sucrose  agar  for the isolation of v. cholerae and v. parahaemolyticus. presumptive large green and yellow colonies with on tcbs were further analysed using chromagartm
vibrio , api  <dig> e , oxidase  for the confirmation of v. parahaemolyticus and v. cholerae respectively according to manufacturers’ instructions. 
listeria monocytogenes





a  <dig> μl-loopful of the post-enriched culture in upb was sub-cultured onto palcam agar for the isolation of l. monocytogenes. presumptive l. monocytogenes colonies on palcam were verified using confirmatory methods similar to the steps mentioned in the above spread plate method. 
campylobacter spp




for pre-packed chicken salads, as well as poultry and egg ingredients from salad bars,  <dig> g of each food sample were homogenised with  <dig> ml of bolton selective enrichment broth  and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h for the detection of campylobacter spp.. a  <dig> μl-loopful of the post-enriched culture in bolton broth was streaked onto modified charcoal-cefoperazone-desoxycholate agar   and incubated at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h under microaerophilic conditions. presumptive grey colonies on mccda were isolated for further confirmation using oxidase test, serological latex agglutination  and api campy  following manufacturers’ instructions. microaerophilic conditions were maintained using campygen sachets  in sealed jars.

characterisation of l. monocytogenes

 multi locus sequencing typing 




sixty-four l. monocytogenes isolates obtained in phase i and ii studies, as well as eight isolates obtained from a brand of salmon products in phase iii study were characterised using the mlst method. the method involved the amplification of seven housekeeping gene regions, namely abcz, bgla, cat, dape, dat, ldh and lhka using published primers and protocol  <cit>  . amplified products were sequenced using the bigdye terminator cycle sequencing kit . nucleotide sequences obtained were then aligned using seqman pro software version  <dig>   and compared with sequences available in the institut pasteur listeria monocytogenes mlst database , so as to obtain information on the allelic profiles and sequence type  of each isolate. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis  software version  <dig>   <cit> ; using the neighbour-joining  method based on concatenated nucleotide sequences of seven mlst house-keeping genes of sequence types detected in phase i and ii studies. serotyping




serotyping was carried out using the listeria antisera set , following the manufacturer’s instructions.

statistical analysis
as microbial data were not normally distributed, statistical differences  in spc levels  among various types of pre-packed salad dishes and salad bar ingredients were evaluated respectively using a non-parametric test, specifically the kruskal-wallis test. multiple pairwise comparison of spc levels  between any two types of pre-packed salad dishes or salad bar ingredients were evaluated using a non-parametric test, specifically the mann-whitney test. statistical analysis was performed using spss v <dig>  software.

microbial analyses of pre-packed smoked salmon
due to a high contamination rate of l. monocytogenes observed in smoked salmon from salad bars, a follow up study was conducted to assess the microbial safety and quality of pre-packed smoked salmon sold at supermarkets between december  <dig> and september  <dig>  our results show that the prevalence of l. monocytogenes in pre-packed smoked salmon from supermarkets  was significantly lower  than smoked salmon displayed at salad bars  . similarly, significantly lower spc  was detected in pre-packed smoked salmon from supermarkets compared to smoked salmon from salad bars . the median spc of pre-packed salmon from supermarkets was  <dig>  log cfu/g and the median spc of smoked salmon from salad bars was  <dig>  log cfu/g.

discussion
the detection of l. monocytogenes in smoked salmon and salads highlighted a need to improve manufacturing and retail hygiene processes
among various foodborne bacteria, l. monocytogenes is often highlighted as a food safety concern in rte food  as the organism is ubiquitous in the environment and can grow at refrigerated temperatures  <cit> . though l. monocytogenes generally causes mild or no symptoms in healthy individuals, it can result in life threatening consequences among the vulnerable populations, particularly pregnant women who may suffer from miscarriages or stillbirths  <cit> . the l. monocytogenes contamination rate of pre-packed smoked salmon collected from supermarkets  in our study was comparable to other countries where the organism was detected in 16% to 32% of the retail smoked salmon tested  <cit> . in the present study, the contamination was largely due to a single brand . the recurrence of l. monocytogenes st <dig> strains and st <dig> strains in multiple batches of brand a’s salmon products over a 4-year period suggested a potential persistent contamination issue at the salmon processing plant. such persistency has been demonstrated in previous studies using random amplified polymorphic dna , and biofilms on difficult-to-clean food contact surfaces or machinery parts in salmon smoking plants were postulated as the source of contamination  <cit> . beside the smoked salmon industry, the presence of persistent l. monocytogenes strains has also been reported in other food and processing environments in the vegetables, meat, dairy and seafood sectors, illustrating the ubiquitous nature of l. monocytogenes and the possible transfer of l. monocytogenes from the environment to finished food products  <cit> . due to the limited discriminatory power of the mlst technique, we could not rule out the possibility that brand a’s salmon products were contaminated with variants of l. monocytogenes belonging to the same sequence types. however, this uncertainty could only be addressed by comparing the sequences of these strains using whole genome sequencing technique. the testing of raw salmon fish and environmental swabs of the manufacturing environment would also be required, to obtain isolates for comparison with those detected in the finished products, so as to confirm the presence and locations of persistence l. monocytogenes strains. nevertheless, the high l. monocytogenes positivity rate in unsealed pre-packed smoked salmon at supermarkets highlighted a need to improve manufacturing hygiene processes. the observations of significantly higher prevalence of l. monocytogenes in smoked salmon from salad bars as compared to supermarkets, suggested that the bacteria could have proliferated along the food supply chain as a result of time-temperature abuse during distribution and storage, and/or cross-contamination during retail food preparation. we observed that the typical shelf life of pre-packed smoked salmon sold in supermarkets was about one to two months, which was a fairly extended period of time that could allow l. monocytogenes to proliferate to high levels. the corresponding higher spc substantiates the need for improved manufacturing processes and cold chain management along the food distribution network.

our study on pre-packed salad dishes and salad bar ingredients shows two interesting findings; the detection of l. monocytogenes st <dig> in pre-packed chicken salads sampled from two geographically distinct outlets of a salad bar chain , and the detection of l. monocytogenes st <dig> in a smoked salmon sample and a chilled cooked shrimp sample from an outlet of a salad bar chain . the detection of strains with common molecular profiles across and within retail facilities has been reported previously  <cit>  and this could be due to several reasons. for instance, these sequence types may be common in the environment which could thus explain their presence in multiple unrelated sources  <cit> . it may be because smoked salmon used by retailers came from a common supplier  <cit> . within a food preparation environment, cross-contamination between food and the environment could also have occurred  <cit> . however, as the discriminatory power of molecular characterisation techniques such as mlst and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis are limited  <cit> , the hypotheses mentioned could only be verified by conducting further studies to obtain information on the sources of smoked salmon used by retailers and compare the sequences of l. monocytogenes strains isolated from food and the environments at various manufacturing plants and retail establishments using whole genome sequencing techniques.

the most frequently encountered l. monocytogenes serotypes in pre-packed smoked salmon from supermarkets were 4b and 1/2b. among the  <dig> known l. monocytogenes serotypes, 4b, 1/2b, 1/2a and 1/2c are the serotypes most commonly associated with human listeriosis  <cit> . a review of literature  and records of the l. monocytogenes mlst database by the institut pasteur  <cit>  showed that st  <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> which were detected in this study, were reported previously in various food types. for instance, st <dig> was previously detected in smoked salmon, cheese and meat, st <dig> in cantaloupe and whipping cream, st <dig> in vegetables and meats, st <dig> in vegetables, meat, fish, seafood and ice-cream, as well as st <dig> in salmon roes . there were also past records on the detection of st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> in the food production environments  <cit>  and st <dig> and st <dig> in rodents  <cit> . four sequence types detected in this study were also found to be associated with human listeriosis in various countries. these included the isolation of st <dig> from maternal-foetal infection cases, central nervous system infection cases and stillborn infants, st <dig> in stillborn infants, as well as st <dig> and st <dig> in bacteraemia, meningitis and peritonitis cases  <cit> . although st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> have been associated with invasive listeriosis in other countries  <cit> , there has not been a notable increase in listeriosis cases reported in singapore in recent years. this may be because listeriosis is not a legally notifiable disease and therefore the number of human cases could have been underreported. worldwide, the annual incidence of listeriosis was between  <dig>  and  <dig>  per million populations; with an increasing trend of human infections reported in europe between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the absence of notable increase in human listerosis cases in singapore could also be due to the limitation of mlst technique in discriminating virulent and avirulent strains within the same sequence type. this warrants further studies to assess the virulence potential and unique characteristics of these strains by performing whole genome analyses.

unsatisfactory spc in high proportion of pre-packed salads and salad ingredients: an indication of poor microbial quality or an overly stringent limit?
although the median spc of pre-packed salads, vegetable ingredients and seafood ingredients at salad bars exceeded the local spc limit for ready-to-eat food   <cit> , the data should be interpreted with caution. spc is often used to estimate the microbial load in food and to provide indication on the overall hygienic quality of a food item  <cit> . if high spc is observed in cooked food, it implies that the food could have been subjected to undercooking, unhygienic handling and/or prolonged storage. as some samples collected in this study consisted of raw vegetables and cold smoked fish, higher spc was expected in these uncooked ingredients  <cit> . overall, the spc of vegetables ingredients and cold smoked salmon samples in our study were comparable to other studies . studies elsewhere have shown that bacteria tend to bind more tightly to rough surface such as lettuce leaves and could internalise plant tissues, and therefore, were not easily removed by washing  <cit> . considering the inherent nature of raw vegetables and cold smoked fish, some countries do not set a maximum spc limit for salads  <cit>  and set a higher limit  for cold smoked fish  <cit> . a review of the local spc limits for such ready-to-eat retail food types is thus recommended.

on the other hand, the relatively high proportions of pasta, rice and couscous ingredients, as well as poultry and egg ingredients exceeding the spc limit were not hygienically acceptable as this suggested the presence of post-cooking contamination, possibly due to improper handling, prolonged storage, inadequate chilling or a combination of these. in contrast, lower spc was observed in pre-packed salad dressing and dressing ingredients from salad bars, probably because salad dressing are generally acidic and the growth of most bacteria is hindered by low ph  <cit> .

the occasional detection of e. coli, s. aureus, b. cereus in salads and salad ingredients highlighted a need to improve retail hygiene processes
as e. coli is part of the commensal gut flora in warm blooded animals, its presence is often used as a hygiene indicator for faecal contamination  <cit> . as fresh produce could easily come into contact with soil or organic fertilisers at the farm level, it was not surprising to detect e. coli occasionally in raw vegetable salads in our study . however, the presence of e. coli in chilled cooked ingredients, such as poultry and eggs , as well as pasta, rice and couscous  was not hygienically acceptable. as e. coli can be inactivated easily by heat treatment, its presence suggested that the ingredients were either undercooked or exposed to post-cooking contamination  <cit> .

although s. aureus was occasionally detected in vegetable ingredients , as well as poultry and eggs ingredients  from salad bars, the organism was not detected in any of the pre-packed salads tested. as s. aureus can be part of humans’ skin flora  <cit> , its presence in salad bar ingredients was not surprising as such ingredients are usually handled extensively during processes like slicing, dicing and mixing. as the s. aureus isolates obtained in this study were not found to possess any enterotoxin genes and the counts were much lower than the level that can produce sufficient enterotoxins to cause food poisoning   <cit> , these ingredients were unlikely to cause food poisoning if consumed. nevertheless, the presence of s. aureus in these ingredients suggested that there were occasional lapses in personnel hygiene.


b. cereus, a spore-forming bacterium commonly found in soil  <cit> , was detected more frequently in pre-packed salads  than in salad bar ingredients . as pre-packed salads were usually kept for a longer period compared to salad bar ingredients due to transportation and display processes, prolonged storage could have provided an opportunity for b. cereus to multiply. b. cereus was also observed to affect various salad bar ingredients to a smaller extent, possibly because the ingredients were left exposed to the environment during display, inadequate chilling or due to the use of common utensils to handle multiple ingredients. although several virulence genes were detected in several b. cereus strains isolated in this study, the counts were much lower than the levels  that are indicative of potential human hazard due to preformed toxins  <cit> .

the present study highlighted several areas for improving retail food hygiene processes. for instance, cross-contamination at the retail level can be minimised by reinforcing good glove and hand hygiene practices, as well as segregating utensils meant for handling raw and ready-to-eat food  <cit> . besides imparting knowledge to food handlers, it is also important to create a strong industrial food safety culture; this could be done through the inclusion of factors such as management’s commitment, food handlers’ sense of personal responsibility and improving risk communication in the holistic development of food safety management systems  <cit> . however, as listeria is ubiquitous in the environment  <cit> , it might be difficult to eradicate its presence completely in certain food types. thus, at risk populations such as pregnant women, the elderly, young children and the immunocompromised individuals should refrain from consuming food prone to listeria contamination .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings highlighted a potential health risk associated with l. monocytogenes in seafood salad ingredients, in particular smoked salmon. while our microbial survey has certain limitations in its sampling design as discussed above, our findings do point to a need for improved manufacturing and retail hygiene processes. public health risk can be further reduced by educating vulnerable populations to avoid the consumption of food prone to listeria contamination. additionally, and although the relatively high spc of raw vegetables in this study should be interpreted with caution, thorough washing of salad vegetables should not be neglected to improve the overall hygiene quality of salads. our findings provided preliminary data that could be useful to support the need for a more in-depth risk assessment study on specific pathogens in retail salad dishes.
