BACKGROUND
dna cytosine-5-methyltransferases  catalyze the methyl transfer from s-adenosyl-l-methionine to the cytosine in cpg dinucleotides. four active dna methyltransferases, dnmt <dig>  dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a, and dnmt3b, have been reported in mammals. these four enzymes contain highly conserved dna methyltransferase motifs; however, genetic and biochemical studies have suggested functional differences between them. dnmt <dig> is considered a maintenance dna methyltransferase, though some de novo methylation activity has been described in vitro  <cit> . dnmt3a and dnmt3b are generally regarded as de novo dna methyltransferases, even though it has been proposed that these enzymes may play a role in the maintenance of methylation in es cells  <cit> . while the biological role of dnmt <dig> remains unknown, it has been reported to methylate dna at a very low level, and it may be involved in non-cpg methylation  <cit> .

de novo methylation mostly occurs during embryonic development and plays an important role in genomic imprinting, x-inactivation, and transposon suppression in mammals. de novo methylation has been described to occur frequently in cancer  and at sites of integrated exogenous dna  <cit> . it has been proposed that de novo methyltransferases may participate in the maintenance of methylation based on the findings that dnmt3a and/or dnmt3b may play roles in restoring methylation at sites missed by dnmt <dig> during replication in es cells  <cit> . a dnmt1-deficient cancer cell line showed little loss of dna methylation, suggesting that the de novo methyltransferases can maintain a high level of dna methylation in the absence of dnmt <dig> in neoplastic cells  <cit> . a more dramatic loss of dna methylation was observed when dnmt <dig> and dnmt3b were both absent from that cell line, suggesting the possible cooperation between these two enzymes  <cit> . another study using antisense and rnai strategies suggested that dnmt <dig> is responsible for global and cpg island methylation in cancer cells  <cit> . these studies raise the possibility that dnmt <dig> and the two de novo methyltransferases may work together in maintaining, as well as establishing, dna methylation patterns.

dnmt3a has been shown to have biochemical characteristics different than dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a shows no preference for hemimethylated over fully unmethylated dna substrates, whereas dnmt <dig> has a strong preference for hemimethylated dna  <cit> . dnmt <dig> has no known preference other than cpg sites in vitro  <cit> , whereas dnmt3a appears to prefer cpg sites flanked by pyrimidines in vitro  <cit>  and shows less specificity for cpg sites than dnmt <dig> both in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . dnmt3a generates asymmetrical methylation pattern on two dna strands in vitro  <cit> . these differences reflect the methylation maintenance function of dnmt <dig> and de novo methylation function of dnmt3a.

it has been reported that pre-existing cytosine methylation at cpg as well as at non-cpg sites can stimulate de novo methylation activity of native and recombinant dnmt <dig> on single-stranded oligonucleotides in vitro  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that single-stranded dna formed during replication or repair might serve as a nucleation site for de novo methylation by dnmt <dig>  <cit> . purified murine dnmt <dig> overexpressed in e. coli also showed increased de novo methylation activity when pre-existing cytosine methylation was present on double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates  <cit> . in another study, introduction of random cpg methylation into plasmid dna stimulated methylation activity of dna methyltransferases partially-purified from human placenta and murine liver  <cit> . a more recent study showed that fully methylated oligonucleotides can also stimulate dnmt <dig> de novo methylation activity in trans  <cit> . these studies demonstrate that pre-existing cytosine methylation on oligonucleotides as well as on plasmids can stimulate the de novo methylation activity of dnmt <dig> in vitro, even though this activity has not been confirmed in vivo. this stimulation may be due to the allosteric activation of the catalytic domain by the binding of dnmt <dig> to methylated dna  <cit> . in our previous studies  <cit> , de novo methylation of the episome by endogenous dnmt <dig> has not been detected in human cells regardless of the methylation status of the episome .

it is clear that dnmt3a is not stimulated by pre-existing cytosine methylation at cpg sites on only one of the dna strands because it does not prefer hemimethylated dna over fully unmethylated dna. while dnmt3a does not appear to be stimulated by methylation at hpaii sites on a  <dig> bp dna fragment  <cit> , extensive testing has not been carried out. one study showed stimulation of dnmt3a by hemimethylated ccg and fully methylated cwg; no stimulation by fully methylated ccg was detected  <cit> . it is curious that dnmt3a is not stimulated by hemimethylated cpg, fully methylated cpg, and fully methylated ccg, but it is stimulated by hemimethylated ccg and fully methylated cwg in vitro  <cit> . in this study, we carried out experiments to determine whether dnmt3a has similar de novo methylation activity on single-stranded substrates and whether it can be stimulated by pre-existing cytosine methylation, as is the case for dnmt <dig> 

RESULTS
dnmt3a has substrate preferences and does not act on single-stranded dna substrates
the activity of murine dnmt3a purified from human cells overexpressing this enzyme was tested in an in vitro methylation assay with in vitro 3h-incorporation using fully unmethylated, hemimethylated, and fully methylated  <dig> bp or  <dig> bp oligonucleotide substrates. all reactions were carried out in duplicate with no protein and no dna controls, and all experiments were done multiple times. the no protein controls routinely showed a very low level of 3h counts; therefore, the level of radioactivity detected in the no dna control was treated as background and subtracted from reactions with dna substrates. dnmt <dig> was used as a control in similar reactions. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , dnmt <dig> is strongly stimulated by hemimethylated substrates showing approximately a 13-fold higher activity on these substrates than on fully unmethylated dna and showed nearly no activity on fully methylated dna . also consistent with the lack of in vitro site preference reported previously  <cit> , virtually no difference in dnmt <dig> activity between the  <dig> bp and the  <dig> bp substrates was detected . this validates the assay and the substrates used.

consistent with previous reports  <cit> , dnmt3a showed a very low activity on all of the  <dig> bp substrates, though the highest activity was detected with fully unmethylated dna ; and nearly no activity was detected with fully methylated substrate  . a dnmt3a catalytic mutant  <cit>  showed background levels of radioactivity, confirming the activity of dnmt3a . in contrast, dnmt3a showed a 20-fold increase in activity on unmethylated  <dig> bp substrates over the unmethylated  <dig> bp substrate . while near background activity was detected on fully methylated substrates , dnmt3a displayed the highest activity on fully unmethylated duplex dna , and its activity on hemimethylated substrates  was two- to three-fold lower . the activity of dnmt3a on hemimethylated and unmethylated  <dig> bp substrates is comparable when the number of available unmethylated cpg sites is taken into account. the  <dig> bp and the  <dig> bp oligonucleotide substrates have  <dig> and  <dig> cpg sites on each strand, respectively. therefore, the difference in dnmt3a activity is not proportional to the number of available cpg sites on the  <dig> bp and the  <dig> bp substrates. consistent with our previous findings  <cit>  and results using several other substrates , these findings suggest that dnmt3a has substrate preferences while dnmt <dig> does not.

a de novo methylation activity of dnmt <dig> has been described as acting on single-stranded substrates at low efficiency in vitro  <cit> . we were interested in determining whether dnmt3a, with its primary function as a de novo methyltransferase, can also use single-stranded dna as a substrate. in vitro methylation assays were carried out using unmethylated and methylated single-stranded oligonucleotides as substrates for the analysis of dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a. dnmt <dig> showed moderate activity on unmethylated single-stranded dna . this activity is five-fold lower than its activity on hemimethylated double-stranded dna substrates  and is two-fold higher than its activity on fully unmethylated duplex dna . these findings are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . unlike dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a showed very little activity on unmethylated single-stranded dna substrates  and this activity is ten-fold lower than its activity on fully unmethylated double-stranded dna . both enzymes showed near background activity on methylated single-stranded dna substrates . these findings clearly indicate that dnmt <dig> has a stronger de novo methylation activity on single-stranded dna substrates than on unmethylated duplex dna, and the de novo methylation activity of dnmt3a primarily targets duplex dna substrates with unmethylated cpg sites and not single-stranded dna. it is also clear that the de novo methylation activity of these two enzymes is quite different in vitro.

pre-existing cytosine methylation on the plasmid does not stimulate methylation activity of dnmt3a in vitro
previous work indicated that partially-purified human and mouse dnmt <dig> has a higher level of methylation activity on partially-methylated plasmids than fully unmethylated plasmids in vitro  <cit> . dnmt3a overproduced in e. coli showed no increased activity in vitro when three hpaii sites were methylated on a  <dig> bp substrate, while dnmt <dig> showed a  <dig> -fold increase in activity, even though the activity reported was low for dnmt3a  <cit> . another report indicated that hemimethylated ccg can stimulate dnmt3a but not dnmt1; fully methylated ccg fails to stimulate either enzyme; and fully methylated cwg can stimulate both enzymes  <cit> . we were interested in further testing whether murine dnmt3a is stimulated by pre-existing cytosine methylation on the plasmid in vitro. plasmid dna is often prepared using dcm-positive strains of e. coli; therefore, it carries methylated cytosines at the internal c of ccgg site. for this experiment, plasmid p <dig>  dna was prepared from a dcm-negative strain  and from a dcm-positive strain  for comparison. the p <dig> -dcm dna was further methylated in vitro using hhai  methylase, hpaii  methylase, haeiii  methylase, and mspi  methylase individually. the p <dig> +dcm dna was also further methylated in vitro using hhai methylase, hpaii methylase, bamhi methylase , and haeiii methylase individually. bamhi, haeiii, and mspi methylases methylate cytosines at non-cpg sites, while hhai and hpaii methylases methylate cytosines at cpg sites. these in vitro methylated substrates were used in the in vitro methylation assay of dnmt3a with p <dig> +dcm and p <dig> -dcm dna as controls. there is very little difference in the dnmt3a methylation activity between plasmid dna with or without dcm methylation, indicating the lack of stimulation by fully methylated cwg sites. although there are minor variations detected for substrates methylated with different methylases, no stimulation by pre-existing cytosine methylation was observed . these findings indicate that dnmt3a is not stimulated by pre-existing symmetrical cytosine methylation at cpg sites or at non-cpg sites on the plasmid substrates in vitro.

pre-existing cpg methylation on a minichromosome does not lead to increased dnmt3a methylation at hhai or hpaii sites in human cells
to test whether pre-existing cpg methylation can stimulate dnmt3a activity in vivo, a previously established assay system was used  <cit> . it has been described previously  <cit> , cotransfection of dnmt3a expression vector with a target plasmid, such as p <dig> , into 293/ebna <dig> cells leads to methylation of the target plasmid while no methylation on the target plasmid was detected when the target plasmid was transfected alone or with a dnmt3a catalytic mutant expression vector into 293/ebna <dig> cells. when the transfected plasmid dna is digested with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme, such as hhai or hpaii, the fraction of the increased size fragments can be compared to the fully digestable fragments in the same lane to assess the activity of dnmt3a on the plasmid. any loading variation between lanes does not interfere with this assessment because no comparisons of fragments across lanes are made. p <dig> -dcm plasmid dna was methylated with hhai methylase, hpaii methylase, haeiii methylase, and mspi methylase in vitro before being co-transfected with the dnmt3a expression vector into 293/ebna <dig> cells. the unmethylated p <dig> -dcm and p <dig> +dcm were used as controls in this experiment. seven days after transfection, the plasmid dna was harvested using the hirt method and analyzed by southern blotting after restriction digestion. there is no appreciable difference in dnmt3a methylation activity on plasmids with and without dcm methylation when the methylation sensitive enzyme hhai is used to assess dna methylation on p <dig>  . there is also little difference in methylation at hhai sites between hpaii-methylated, haeiii-methylated, and mspi-methylated p <dig> -dcm plasmid dna versus plasmid dna without in vitro methylation . no apparent differences were detected in dnmt3a methylation activity at hpaii sites between unmethylated plasmid and hhai-methylated, haeiii-methylated, and mspi-methylated plasmid dna . when hhai, hpaii, bamhi, and haeiii methylases were used to methylate p <dig> +dcm dna, similar results were observed in the transfection experiments . similar levels of dnmt3a protein was detected at two days after transfection by western blot using the myc antibody in the experiments where dnmt3a expression was monitored . when the same experiments were carried out using 3a- <dig> cells that overexpress murine dnmt3a, similar results were seen . these results indicate that pre-existing symmetrical methylation at cpg sites or non-cpg sites does not stimulate dnmt3a methylation at hhai or hpaii sites in human cells.

pre-existing cpg methylation at hpaii or hhai sites on the minichromosome does not stimulate dnmt3a methylation at other cpg sites in human cells
to examine whether methylation at cpg sites other than hhai or hpaii sites is stimulated by pre-existing cytosine methylation, sodium bisulfite sequencing of three different regions in the ebna <dig> gene of the plasmid harvested from transfected human cells was carried out. the unmethylated p <dig> , hhai-methylated p <dig> , and hpaii-methylated p <dig>  plasmids harvested from transfected cells were regionally sequenced for comparison. methylation at the hhai and the hpaii sites was excluded from the calculation of methylation because of the pre-existing methylation at these sites on the hhai-methylated and hpaii-methylated plasmids.

unmethylated p <dig>  showed  <dig> % methylation in the ebna <dig> region  <dig>   <dig> % methylation in the ebna <dig> region  <dig>  and  <dig> % methylation in the ebna <dig> region  <dig> . hhai-methylated plasmid p <dig>  had  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of methylation in ebna <dig> regions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . similar levels of methylation  were found on hpaii-methylated p <dig>  . the patterns of methylation in all three regions of the ebna <dig> gene were also similar for these three plasmids . previously,  <dig>  % and  <dig> % of methylation were detected in the ebna <dig> region  <dig> and region  <dig>  respectively, in similar experiments  <cit> . the percentage of overall methylation is higher in region  <dig> of hhai-methylated p <dig>  than unmethylated and hpaii-methylated p <dig> . the percentage of overall methylation in region  <dig> is also higher in both hhai-methylated and hpaii-methylated p <dig>  than unmethylated p <dig> . however, the patterns of methylation are similar for all plasmids in all three regions. we reasoned that if preexisting methylation hhai or hpaii sites can stimulate dnmt3a in vivo, a larger fraction of highly methylated molecules should be observed in the transfected hhai-methylated and hpaii-methylated p <dig>  plasmid when compared with unmethylated p <dig> . therefore, the sequenced molecules were sorted into two groups, a group with more than 50% of the cpg sites methylated and one with less than 50% of the cpg sites methylated. a chi-square test was then carried out to test the hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the number of molecules in these two groups from p <dig> , hhai-methylateed-p <dig> , and hpaii-methylated p <dig>  plasmids. fisher's exact test was used to test the same hypothesis for results from region  <dig> because no molecules from unmethylated and hhai-methylated p <dig>  had more than 50% of the cpg sites methylated. the p values of the statistical tests were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for regions  <dig>   <dig>  and,  <dig>  respectively , indicating that the difference is not significant. the same tests were carried out for regions  <dig> and  <dig> with a different cut-off for the sorting to ensure that this does not change the outcome. when the sequenced molecules from region  <dig> were sorted as one group with  <dig> to  <dig> methylated cpg sites and another group with  <dig> to  <dig> methylated cpg sites, the p value of the chi-square test is  <dig> . when the sequenced molecules from region  <dig> were sorted into a group with  <dig> to  <dig> methylated cpg sites and a group with  <dig> to  <dig> methylated sites, the p value of the chi-square test is  <dig> . therefore, the higher level of methylation observed in the ebna <dig> regions  <dig> and  <dig> on hhai-methylated plasmid and in the ebna <dig> regions  <dig> and  <dig> on hpaii-methylated plasmid is considered within normal experimental variation and not due to stimulation of dnmt3a by the pre-existing methylation at hhai of hpaii sites. these findings indicate that there is no stimulation of methylation at other cpg sites in human cells when hhai or hpaii sites carry pre-existing cytosine methylation. it is noteworthy that no methylation at non-cpg sites was detected in all three regions sequenced.

discussion
it has been described that the de novo methylation activity of dnmt <dig> can act on single-stranded dna  <cit> . this leads to the hypothesis that single-stranded dna formed during replication or repair might serve as a nucleation site for de novo methylation  <cit> . several studies suggest that cpg islands may serve as dna replication origins . as first described by baylin in  <dig>  <cit> , hypermethylation of cpg islands has been well recognized to occur in cancer. it is possible that the single-stranded dna methylation activity of dnmt <dig> targets it to cpg islands that are dna replication origins and initiates de novo methylation in the genome. since the primary function of dnmt3a is de novo methylation, it is important to know whether dnmt3a has such an activity. unlike dnmt <dig>  we find here that dnmt3a does not act on single-stranded oligonucleotides in vitro. although one previous study  <cit>  reported dnmt3a methylation of single-stranded oligonucleotide substrates, the conclusion remains unclear based on the substrate used in that study. the substrate used in yokochi and robertson  <cit>  has  <dig> cpg sites on an oligomer which is  <dig> nucleotides in length and which has gatc on both ends; therefore, it can form double-stranded regions over substantial lengths both intra- and inter-molecularly under low salt and moderately high temperature conditions. in contrast, the  <dig> bases oligonucleotide substrate used in this study does not form cpg pairing either intra- or inter-molecularly based on several oligonucleotide analysis software packages. furthermore, no other conformation was observed when the radioactive-labeled oligonucleotide was resolved on a native gel either as single-stranded or double-stranded configuration .

in our study, dnmt3a showed a much higher activity on the  <dig> bp double-stranded dna substrate than on the  <dig> bp substrate, indicating some form of substrate preference. we have tested other substrates ranging from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp and the substrate length or the potential processivity of the enzyme is not the basis for these differences , indicating that local dna sequence is the basis. these findings suggest functional differences for the de novo methylation activity of these two enzymes. based on our study here, if de novo methylation occurs at cpg sites within dna with single-stranded features in vivo, then dnmt3a is not likely to be the methyltransferase responsible for this process. also, dnmt3a may prefer certain sequences while dnmt <dig> does not discriminate among its targets.

it has been shown that pre-existing cytosine methylation can stimulate de novo methylation activity of dnmt <dig> in vitro both in cis and in trans  <cit> . this suggests that dnmt <dig> can be stimulated by hemimethylated dna as well as symmetrically methylated dna. in a previous study, dnmt3a overproduced in e. coli showed no increased activity when three hpaii sites were methylated on a  <dig> bp substrate, even though the activity of dnmt3a was low  <cit> . however, another study showed stimulation of dnmt3a by hemimethylated ccg and fully methylated cwg  <cit> . here, we performed both in vitro and in vivo testing of whether pre-existing cytosine methylation can stimulate dnmt3a, including fully methylated ccg and cwg sites. we find that dcm+ plasmid dna does not stimulate dnmt3a activity in vitro when compared with plasmid dna without methylation at these dcm sites, suggesting the lack of stimulation by methylation at cwg sites. this finding is at odds with the finding of kim et al.  <cit> . there are several non-cpg sites on the methylated cwg and ccg substrates used in kim et al.  <cit> . it is possible that cwg methylation does not stimulate cpg methylation but stimulates a non-cpg methylation activity in those reactions, since the dnmt3a used in kim et al. was demonstrated to have non-cpg methylation activity  <cit> . the dnmt3a used in our study has no detectable non-cpg methylation activity; therefore, no increased activity was observed with pre-existing cytosine methylation. however, it is intriguing that dnmt3a is not stimulated by hemimethylated cpg, fully methylated cpg, or fully methylated ccg, and yet it is stimulated by hemimethylated ccg and fully methylated cwg in vitro  <cit> . whether this difference is due to the expression of the enzyme in insect cells versus human cells would need further investigation. there is also no stimulation of the dnmt3a activity in vitro by cytosine methylation at other cpg or non-cpg sites on the plasmid with or without dcm methylation. these findings indicate a clear difference between the de novo methylation activity of dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a in vitro.

transfection experiments also showed that pre-existing cytosine methylation at cpg sites or non-cpg sites does not stimulate dnmt3a to methylate cpgs at hhai and hpaii sites on the minichromosome. sodium bisulfite sequencing of the transfected minichromosome further showed that methylation at hhai or hpaii sites does not lead to increased methylation at other cpg sites. methylation at non-cpg sites by dnmt3a was not detected in any of the molecules sequenced, indicating the lack of non-cpg methylation by dnmt3a in this particular human cell line. these findings demonstrate that pre-existing cytosine methylation does not stimulate dnmt3a activity for either cpg or non-cpg methylation in human cells.

it has been proposed that dnmt <dig> plays a role in dna methylation spreading in mammalian cells  <cit> . in our previous transfection experiments using patch-methylated minichromosomes, no spreading of methylation from the methylated patch was observed  <cit> . we also have not observed de novo methylation on the transfected minichromosomes with methylation at hhai or hpaii sites by bisulfite sequencing . these findings indicate the lack of de novo methylation activity on these minichromosomes without overexpression of dnmt3a in human cells. although it remains unclear which methyltransferases are involved in methylation spreading, the fact that dnmt3a is not stimulated by hemimethylated dna or by symmetrically methylated dna strongly suggests that dnmt3a does not participate in this process. consistent with the findings in fatemi et al  <cit> , we have found that plasmid dna premethylated with dnmt3a stimulates dnmt <dig> activity more than two-fold in vitro . in our previous study, dnmt3a generates an asymmetrical methylation pattern on the two dna strands in vitro  <cit> .

therefore, it is very likely that one of the processes for de novo methylation is for dnmt3a to initiate methylation on one dna strand; then this hemimethylated dna would lead to the stimulation of dnmt <dig> for further methylation . this activity of dnmt <dig> would be in addition to its known methylation of hemimethylated sites after dna replication .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we demonstrated several novel differences between dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a de novo methylation activity. unlike dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a produced in human cells has very little activity on single-stranded dna in vitro. while dnmt <dig> shows higher de novo methylation activity on single-stranded substrates than on unmethylated duplex dna, dnmt3a primarily acts on unmethylated sites on duplex dna. dnmt <dig> shows no preference for substrates with different sequence or length, whereas dnmt3a shows preference for different substrates. in contrast to dnmt <dig>  dnmt3a is not stimulated by pre-existing cytosine methylation on plasmids either at cpg sites or non-cpg sites in vitro. this is the first study demonstrating that pre-existing cytosine methylation does not stimulate the activity of dnmt3a at cpg or non-cpg sites in human cells. the de novo methylation activity of these two enzymes is clearly different.
