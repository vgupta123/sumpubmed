BACKGROUND
it is well known that stable, persistent viral infections can be maintained in insect cell cultures and that such cultures often show no adverse signs of infection  <cit> . this phenomenon has been most studied in arboviruses such as dengue virus that are carried by insect host vectors as innocuous infections, but cause disease in target vertebrate hosts. in fact, persistent, innocuous, viral infections appear to be common in insects and crustaceans as single infections or dual to multiple co-infections  <cit> . with both shrimp and commercial insects such as honey bees, it is known that these stable, persistent infection states characterized by absence of disease can sometimes shift to overt disease states as a result of various stress triggers  <cit>  and that this can result in serious economic losses  <cit> . thus, the main research interest of our group focuses on understanding the dynamics of single to multiple, persistent viral infections in shrimp and how environmental conditions or other stress can sometimes destabilize them. since no continuous cell lines have ever been successfully developed for crustaceans, we have had to turn to continuous insect cell lines and insects to try to understand the dynamics of these interactions  <cit> .

during the course of establishing c6/ <dig> mosquito cell cultures persistently infected with dengue virus, we accidentally discovered that cell-free supernatant solutions from these cultures could reduce and delay the onset of cytopathology in naïve c6/ <dig> cells newly challenged with dengue virus. conversely, cell-free supernatant solutions from acutely infected cultures were capable of destabilizing persistently-infected cultures in a manner similar to the destabilization that occurs in shrimp and insect populations. here we describe the relevant experiments and show that the active factors in the cell-free supernatant solutions are probably small polypeptides with cytokine-like activity.

RESULTS
persistent dengue virus infections
after primary challenge of naïve c6/ <dig> cell cultures with den- <dig> followed by split-passage every  <dig> days, stable cultures persistently infected with den- <dig> were obtained with 100% den- <dig> positive cells, as previously described  <cit> . the growth rate of cultures persistently infected with den- <dig> did not differ significantly  from that of uninfected cell cultures. the gross signs of den- <dig> infection declined with increasing passage number. from passage  <dig> onwards the cultures did not differ morphologically from naïve c6/ <dig> cell cultures. however den- <dig> released into the culture medium could initiate acute den- <dig> infections in naïve cells, as previously reported  <cit> . neither these preparations nor den- <dig> stock inoculum caused any changes when used to challenge cultures persistently infected with den- <dig> 

filtrate from persistently infected cells protects naïve cells against den-2
immunofluorescence assay using an antibody to den- <dig> envelope protein revealed that 48-h pretreatment of naïve c6/ <dig> cells with the  <dig> kda filtrate from cell cultures persistently infected with den- <dig> led to a significant reduction  in the percentage of den- <dig> immunopositive cells  when compared to untreated cells after den- <dig> challenge  . these results were confirmed by using vero cells to measure the den- <dig> titers in supernatant solutions from the treated insect cells. the titers were  <dig> ×  <dig> +/-  <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig> ×  <dig> +/-  <dig> at  <dig> h for naive cells but  <dig> ×  <dig> +/-  <dig> ×  <dig> at  <dig> h and  <dig>  ×  <dig> +/-  <dig>  ×  <dig> at  <dig> h for filtrate-exposed cells . to achieve the maximum reduction in numbers of immunopositive cells and the least cytopathology, it was necessary to pre-incubate the cells for  <dig> h prior to den- <dig> challenge. exposure to the active preparation for periods less than  <dig> h was proportionally less effective in inducing resistance . the pre-incubation requirement suggested that reduction in severity of den- <dig> infection was induced in the challenged cells by an active factor in the filtrate.

to confirm that the den- <dig> positive cells arose from challenge with the den- <dig> stock and not from virions in the  <dig> kda filtrate, naïve c6/ <dig> cells were exposed to the  <dig> kda filtrate, to wash from the upper side of the  <dig> kda membrane and to unfiltered supernatant solution from the culture from which the filtrate was derived  . after  <dig> days of incubation, phase contrast microscopy revealed that the wash from the upper side of the  <dig> kda membrane resulted in the most severe cytopathology  in the naïve c6/ <dig> cells , while exposure to the whole, unfiltered culture filtrate  gave cytopathology similar to that produced by the den- <dig> stock . pre-exposure of naïve c6/ <dig> cells to the  <dig> kda filtrate reduced the severity of dengue infection   and exposure to the  <dig> kda filtrate in the absence of den- <dig> challenge resulted in no cytopathology , i.e., morphology similar to that of unchallenged, naïve cells .

in summary, results from these tests indicated that  <dig> h pre-exposure of c6/ <dig> cells to a low molecular weight substance in a  <dig> kda filtrate from persistently-infected cells was able to induce a protective response against den- <dig> virus infection in naïve cells. molecules that have such activity can be called cytokines and we would like to coin the term "viprolaxikine"  for the agent discovered in this work.

to date, few cytokines have been described from insects or insect cells. examples include a growth-blocking peptide present in hemolymph of larvae of the insect armyworm pseudaletia separata parasitized by the wasp apanteles kariyai. the growth-blocking peptide has repressive activity against juvenile hormone esterase  <cit> . another growth-blocking peptide  from lepidopteran insects regulates larval growth, cell proliferation, and immune cell  stimulation  <cit> . these cytokines belong to what is called the enf multifunctional peptide family that is characterized by the unique enf amino acid consensus sequence at their n termini  <cit> . one of these enf peptides has been reported to be induced by viral infection in silkworms  <cit>  and another from moth larvae has been reported to stimulate aggregation and directed movement of phagocytic hemocytes  <cit> . by contrast, the non-enf cytokine, astakine was actually required for infectivity of white spot syndrome virus in haematopoietic cells of the freshwater crayfish, pacifastacus leniusculus  <cit> .

another group of insect cytokine-like peptides that have antiviral activity are called alloferons  <cit> . these peptides are composed of 12- <dig> amino acids and they can stimulate natural cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes, induce interferon synthesis in mouse and human models, and enhance antiviral and antitumor activity in mice. although the effect of these substances on insect cells has not been reported, it is possible that viprolaxikine may be an alloferon-like substance. if so, it would be the first alloferon-like substance reported to be produced in an insect cell culture rather than in whole insects. if so, this insect system might constitute a simple model for studying alloferon induction and alloferon control mechanisms in insect cells.

another antiviral protein  has been described from c6/ <dig> cells persistently infected with sindbis virus  <cit> . it was purified to homogeneity and found to be a very hydrophobic peptide of  <dig> kda  <cit> . when only one clone  of naïve c6/ <dig> cells is exposed to avp for  <dig> h, the cells not only became refractory to infection by sindbis virus but also continuously produced avp and remained refractory to sindbis virus upon subsequent passage, i.e., they became permanently altered by a single exposure to avp. avp had no protective activity against sinbis virus in bhk- <dig> mammalian cells  <cit>  and the actual amino acid sequence has not been reported. the requirement for  <dig> h pre-exposure to obtain protection against sindbis virus is similar to the requirement of pre-incubation with viprolaxikine for den- <dig> protection in c6/ <dig> cells. an antiviral substance similar to avp was reported from mosquito cells infected with semliki forest virus   but not from mosquito cells infected with encephalitis virus  or bunyamwera virus , leading to the suggestion that avp-like substances were unique to viruses in the family alphaviridae  <cit> . thus, viprolaxikine has some similarities to avp in terms of small size and pre-exposure requirement for activity, but it also differs in arising from cells infected with a virus from the family flaviviridae. since the structure of avp and viprolaxikine are still unknown their relationship to each other and to enf peptides and alloferons is currently unknown.

filtrate from acutely infected cells destabilizes persistently infected cells
when c6/ <dig> cells persistently-infected with den- <dig>  were exposed to cell-free filtrate from acutely infected cells  a confocal immunofluorescence assay for apoptosis-like activity revealed positive signals  but none in untreated cells at  <dig> h post exposure . the yo-pro- <dig> positively-stained cells increased with time and at 3- <dig> days post-exposure some cpe was seen, but this was less than that observed when naïve cells were challenged with den- <dig> stock. in addition, split-passage of the filtrate-exposed cultures led to more rapid return to normal cell morphology than occurred with den-2-challenged, naïve cells.

no apoptosis activity was detected in control cell cultures persistently infected with den- <dig>  but not exposed to filtrate . nor were there any apoptosis-positive cells in persistently-infected cells exposed to  <dig> kda membrane filtrates from naïve cells . the complete absence of apoptosis in these persistently infected cells contrasted with a very small number of weakly immunopositive cells in untreated naïve c6/ <dig> cell cultures , indicating a low level of apoptosis. this is not uncommon, since apoptosis is a normal process for maintenance of homeostasis and elimination of occasional aberrant cells  <cit> . for example, low levels of apoptosis have been previously reported for normal, uninfected c6/ <dig> control cells in experiments with sindbis virus  <cit> . absence of any apoptosis in the persistently-infected cell cultures may indicate that it is being positively suppressed.

the induction of apoptosis by addition of a filtrate containing a low molecular weight agent to grossly normal, stable cultures of mosquito cells persistently infected with den- <dig> constitutes a process of destabilization of the persistent infection and at least partial reversion to a diseased state with reoccurrence of pathology seen when naïve c6/ <dig> cells are first exposed to den- <dig> prior to serial passage. this resembles the situation that occurs when innocuous, persistent, viral infection states in shrimp and insects are shifted to disease states by stress triggers. it has been reported that massive apoptosis called kakoapoptosis  <cit>  occurs in moribund shrimp infected with white spot syndrome virus   <cit>  and yellow head virus  <cit> . our results raise the possibility that such apoptosis may be mediated by a low molecular weight cytokine-like agent that could be triggered by various types of stress in cells persistently infected with viruses and could be referred to as apinductokine . for example, mammalian tumor necrosis factor  is the prototypic member of a family of cytokines that interact with a large number of receptors and may induce apoptosis  <cit> . insects have been reported to have homologues of tnf   <cit>  and to tnf receptors   <cit> . there are recent indications that they may be related to stress-induced apoptosis in insects via the jnk pathway  <cit> . given that the cytokine-like substance described herein is very much smaller than even the soluble form of eiger, it is probably a distinct identity that may function via a receptor distinct from wengen.

in any case, this cytokine-like model for destabilization of c6/ <dig> cells persistently infected with den- <dig> provides the first opportunity for detailed analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms both for production of this cytokine and for its induction of apoptosis using such tools as gene expression analysis by suppression subtractive hybridization.

viprolaxikine activity removed by proteinase-k treatment
trials on proteinase treatment of filtrates were carried our using vero cells to measure the den- <dig> titers in the supernatant solutions of naïve c6/ <dig> cells pre-exposed to filtrates prior to challenge with the den- <dig> stock inoculum. results  showed that mock-treated naïve c6/ <dig> cells  yielded high titers  while cells pre-exposed to filtrate yielded significantly  lower titers , and cells pre-exposed to proteinase-k-treated filtrate yielded titers  not significantly different  from the positive control. results were similar whether proteinase-k activity was removed after filtrate treatment by heating plus  <dig> kda filtration or by  <dig> kda filtration only. since, proteinase-k treatment almost completely removed protection and restored the titer of the den- <dig> stock solution, it was concluded that viprolaxikine was most likely a small polypeptide.

apinductokine activitiy removed by proteinase-k treatment
proteinase-k treatment of  <dig> kda membrane filtrates from c6/ <dig> cultures acutely infected with den- <dig> removed their ability to induce apoptosis in c6/ <dig> cells persistently infected with den- <dig> . as with viprolaxikine, apinductokine inactivation occurred whether proteinase-k activity was removed from the treated filtrate by heating plus  <dig> kda filtration or by  <dig> kda filtration only. these tests indicated that apinductokine was also a small polypeptide.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this communication has revealed that extracts from c6/ <dig> cell cultures infected with dengue virus contain previously unknown cytokine-like substances that can alter the host insect cell response to dengue virus. it is the first report of an antiviral substance induced in insect cells by infection with a virus in the family flaviviridae. the fact that the cell sources and activities of the substances differed and that their activities were removed by treatment with proteinase-k suggested that at least two different, low molecular-weight polypeptides were responsible, one for protection of naïve cells against den- <dig> infection and the other for induction of apoptosis in c6/ <dig> cells persistently infected with den- <dig>  further work is needed to characterize these cytokine-like substances  to allow comparison with other low molecular weight polypeptides, to study their mechanism of action and to test their range of activities with several viruses and cell types.
