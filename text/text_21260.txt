BACKGROUND
the serpins are a superfamily of proteins sharing a conserved tertiary structure  <cit>  that has evolved primarily to control proteolytic activity, although some have evolved non-inhibitory functions  <cit> . to date, over  <dig> serpin sequences have been identified in the genomes of species from almost all phyla including viruses, bacteria, metazoans and plants  <cit> .

the serpin mechanism of inhibition is based on the metastable nature of the native serpin fold  <cit> . the reactive centre loop  is exposed at the top of the serpin where it acts as a pseudosubstrate for the target proteinase  <cit> . following cleavage of the rcl, a conformational rearrangement, termed the stressed to relaxed transition, occurs and the rcl inserts into a β-sheet forming an extra β-strand  <cit> . this rearrangement is responsible for the distortion and irreversible inactivation of the target proteinase  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis has divided serpins into  <dig> clades and a number of orphan sequences  <cit> . the clade b serpins are primarily intracellular proteinase inhibitors  <cit> . in humans this clade consists of  <dig> members and includes regulators of inflammation, apoptosis and angiogenesis . the genes are arranged at two genomic loci at 6p <dig>  and 18q <dig> , and all clade b serpins described to date conform to two related gene structures of seven or eight exons. both the phasing and positioning of the intron/exon splice sites are identical for six introns, leading to conserved exon lengths. the additional intron splice site of the 8-exon structure is also conserved, although the extra exon encodes a highly divergent sequence of variable length, termed the cd loop.

although clade b serpins have been identified in mammals  as well as birds, it is not known how they evolved, nor has the primordial structure or gene been identified. two competing models exist to explain the presence of two clade b loci in humans. the first proposes duplication of the entire 6p <dig> locus followed by a number of single gene duplications at 18q <dig>  <cit> . the second proposes duplication of a single gene from 18q <dig> to 6p <dig>  followed by successive duplications at both loci to derive the modern complement  <cit> . two key differences are apparent between these models. the former assumes that the 7-exon structure and 6p <dig> locus are ancestral, whereas the latter assumes the opposite.

here, we use the completed chicken genome to show that the two mammalian loci are the result of an ancient chromosomal split, as orthologues of genes from both human loci are linked in the chicken. further analysis of emerging genome sequences suggests that clade b serpin genes arose from a primordial serpinb <dig> or b <dig> gene with seven exons, the additional exon being gained in serpinb <dig> after the divergence of amphibians and amniotes.

RESULTS
clade b serpin genes in the chicken 
to determine which of the two clade b serpin loci is ancestral, the chicken genome was investigated, as it represents a distantly related species. this analysis was also recently performed independently by another group, yielding similar results  <cit> . as illustrated in figure 2a, the chicken genome contains a single clade b serpin locus on chromosome  <dig>  composed of  <dig> genes, nine of which are supported by est data. both gene structures are also evident within the locus. single orthologues exist in the chicken for the 7-exon human genes serpinb <dig> , serpinb <dig>  and serpinb <dig> , and also for the 8-exon genes serpinb <dig>  and serpinb <dig> . human serpinb <dig> , an 8-exon gene, has  <dig> chicken homologues – ment  and a ment-like gene for which the structure cannot be completely determined. the three remaining chicken genes serpinb <dig> , serpinb14b  and serpinb14c  are highly related  <cit>  and have no human orthologues. this suggests that the common ancestor of chickens and mammals had a complement of six clade b serpin genes: serpinb <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  furthermore, the organization of the chicken clade b serpin locus matches that of humans, contradicting both previously proposed models of clade b serpin gene evolution. rather than two independently evolving loci, it suggests that both the 7- and 8-exon gene structures evolved at a single locus in the common ancestor of birds and mammals that then split to yield the  <dig> loci apparent in humans and rodents.

evolution of clade b serpin genes in vertebrates
since both the  <dig> and 8-exon gene structures were present in the chicken genome, we investigated more distantly related genomes to identify which structure arose first. each of the  <dig> human protein sequences were used to probe the current builds of vertebrate genomes to identify clade b serpin genes. this identified genes with strong rcl similarity to human clade b serpins in the genomes of fish, amphibians and various mammals. by plotting the presence of genes on a dendrogram of species a pattern of gene evolution can be proposed .

as described above, the common ancestor of mammals and birds contained a single clade b serpin gene locus of six genes . all of the mammalian genomes examined so far  contain two loci, suggesting that the chromosomal split occurred early in mammalian evolution . the locus syntenic with human 6p <dig> contains serpinb <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> in humans, chimpanzees, and dogs and an expanded repertoire of  <dig> and  <dig> in mice and rats, respectively  <cit> , indicating further expansion within the rodent lineage. the incomplete rabbit genome yielded hits for  <dig> of the human clade b serpins , with no evidence of the expansion observed in rats or mice. furthermore, the serpinb <dig> rcl sequence of rabbits is predicted to match that of humans whereas the rodent serpinb <dig> rcl is mutated.

the locus syntenic to human 18q <dig> is identical between mammals with the exception of the serpinb <dig> and serpinb <dig> genes , which are unique to each species . this suggests that  <dig> genes were present in the mammalian common ancestor – serpinb <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> at one locus, and serpinb <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and the primordial serpinb3/b <dig> at the other. since then, the ancestral serpinb3/b <dig> has evolved independently in each mammalian species.

further back in evolution, chickens and mammals shared a common ancestor with amphibians approximately  <dig> million years ago, and the genome of xenopus tropicalis  provides an insight into this more primitive gene cluster . the x. tropicalis genome contains a single clade b serpin locus of  <dig> genes , bounded by orthologues of whip and vps4b. the placement of both serpin and non-serpin genes is conserved between the frog and chicken genomes, strengthening our hypothesis that a single clade b serpin gene cluster has split at some point in mammalian evolution . again, the phylogenetic tree confirms that clade b serpin genes cluster on the basis of conserved function, rather than by species .

 <dig> million years ago, amphibians, birds and mammals shared a common ancestor with fish  <cit> . three fish genomes were available for analysis: danio rerio , tetraodon nigroviridis  and takifugu rubripes . the t. rubripes and t. nigroviridis genomes each contain one or two copies of serpinb <dig>  respectively, with no other serpin genes for over  <dig> kb upstream or downstream, while the d. rerio locus contains two copies of serpinb <dig>  linked to two other genes with rcl sequences that do not match any human serpins. however, ests derived from both serpinb <dig> and serpinb <dig> can be identified from all three species, indicating the presence of another clade b serpin locus. indeed, a second locus is identifiable in the d. rerio and t. nigroviridis genomes. the t. nigroviridis locus contains only serpinb <dig>  although the contig is very short and other genes may exist. the d. rerio region contains a number of clade b serpin gene fragments as well as a gene with rcl homology to human serpinb <dig>  although no orthologue of serpinb <dig> can be identified. however, the bac clone finishes in intronic sequence between the final two exons of a serpin gene, and therefore this fragment may be the 5' region of d. rerio serpinb <dig> 

gene structure
the gene structures of the newly identified genes from xenopus and fish were determined by alignment of ests to genomic sequence as well as by genscan predictions . human serpinb <dig> is a 7-exon gene, and this is also the case for serpinb <dig> in the three fish genomes investigated, as well as the novel genes identified in danio rerio. lack of est coverage resulted in an inability to determine intron phasing for the t. nigroviridis and t. rubripes genes, however, the positioning of the introns within the predicted mrna was consistent with the mammalian clade b serpins.

overlapping ests allowed construction of complete mrna sequences for all  <dig> of the xenopus genes. serpinb <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig> conformed to the 7-exon structure, and both positioning and phasing of the intron/exon boundaries was conserved with humans. the other gene to appear in frogs is serpinb <dig>  an 8-exon gene in the chicken and mammalian genomes. however, this gene in frogs contained only 7-exons, lacking the extra exon encoding the cd loop. this gene structure was confirmed by est dr <dig> which spans all  <dig> intron/exon boundaries. as shown in figure 2b, xenopus serpinb <dig> is clearly related to human and chicken serpinb <dig>  suggesting that the 8-exon structure arose some time between the divergence of amphibians and amniotes in the serpinb <dig> gene.

discussion
the human genome contains two clusters of clade b serpin genes at 6p <dig> and 18q <dig>  the  <dig> genes all conform to either a 7- or 8-exon gene structure with conservation of both phasing and positioning of intron/exon boundaries. to address possible mechanisms of clade b gene evolution, the chicken genome was analysed and found to contain a single clade b gene cluster of  <dig> genes. another recent investigation of the chicken genome also identified these  <dig> genes, however, the authors concluded that the newly identified ment-like chicken gene, serpinb10a, and human serpinb <dig> represented direct orthologues  <cit> . this was based on the overall protein similarity as well as homology within the cd loop and rcl. while the rcl sequence of chicken serpinb10a and human serpinb <dig> have some similarities, there are a number of charge differences throughout the rcl, and optimal alignment requires insertion of a gap at the p side , a feature not observed between other chicken-human orthologues. furthermore, although the presence of a cd loop would be predicted in serpinb10a given its evolutionary ancestry, the presence of an eighth exon requires experimental proof. without direct sequencing of a transcript, it remains possible that the exon may be missing or contain a premature stop codon or mis-sense mutation resulting in a lack of functional protein expression. the exon identified by benarafa and remold-o'donnell had a very low statistical score  <cit> , and decreasing the genscan settings to detect this exon leads to the identification of a number of potential exons in other serpin genes that are not transcribed .

the identification of orthologues  of both mammalian clusters  at a single genomic locus in the chicken raises the intriguing possibility that the serpin clusters arose from an ancient chromosomal breakage, rather than chromosomal duplication events. more distantly related genomes appear to support this conclusion as a single clade b serpin gene cluster exists in the xenopus tropicalis genome, consisting of serpinb <dig>  b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  therefore, the two loci observed in mammals arose from this single cluster of four 7-exon genes. serpinb <dig> gained an extra exon and was duplicated to give rise to the 8-exon genes, followed by a chromosomal split yielding two loci. this presents a much simpler mechanism for the observation of different genetic structures at a single locus than previously proposed models  <cit>  .

since serpinb <dig> and serpinb <dig> are linked in frogs, chickens and humans, it is likely that they were linked in their common ancestor with fish, however, this was not the case in any of the fish genomes investigated. this may be due to a whole genome duplication that occurred early in the evolution of ray finned fish, followed by rapid loss of duplicate genes  <cit> . this could give rise to the two serpin loci that have since evolved separately . therefore, we propose that the single primordial serpin clade b locus  contained only serpinb <dig> and serpinb <dig>  as these are the only two genes identifiable in ests from multiple species of fish. following the whole genome duplication, one gene was lost from each locus  and each of these loci have since evolved uniquely in descendant fish species . the fish family polypteridae  diverged from teleost fish before the whole genome duplication  <cit> , and as such, a genomic analysis within this family would be predicted to show a single 'primordial' clade b serpin gene locus of serpinb <dig> and serpinb <dig> 

the identification of a serpinb <dig> homologue in the d. rerio genome suggests that this gene may have evolved significantly earlier than the tetrapod lineage, however, no corroborating ests can be found in other fish species. a number of unique clade b serpins have evolved in zebrafish, at both genomic loci, which cannot be found in other fish genomes or est databases, indicating a more rapid evolution in this fish species. furthermore, phylogenetic analysis indicates that danio serpinb <dig> does not cluster with serpinb <dig> from other species, but rather with danio serpinb <dig> , and suggests that the danio rerio serpinb <dig> gene may be a case of convergent evolution.

six genes  were gained early along the mammalian branch and the cluster split into two loci, although when these events occurred in relation to each other cannot currently be discerned. the current effort to sequence the platypus  genome, as well as a number of marsupials , which branched off early in mammalian evolution may shed some light on this.

the analysis of frog serpinb <dig> clearly shows that it is a 7-exon gene, despite having eight exons in both chickens and mammals. this shows that the 7-exon structure arose first and that the eighth exon was gained in serpinb <dig> some time after amphibians evolved, but before mammals and birds split. the gain of the cd loop has enabled some members of the clade b serpin family to evolve motifs for secondary functions, without affecting their inhibitory role  <cit> . the at-hook motif and nuclear localisation signal  of chicken ment  <cit>  are found in the cd-loop, as is the nls of human bomapin  <cit> . the extended cd-loop of pai- <dig> contains motifs necessary for its suppression of tumour necrosis factor α induced death  <cit> , redox sensitivity  <cit>  and cross-linking to cell membranes  <cit>  as well as a novel motif for binding to retinoblastoma protein  <cit> .

these analyses suggest that either serpinb <dig> or serpinb <dig> is the original clade b serpin gene, and that it was present in the common ancestor of euteleostomi  approximately  <dig> million years ago. a possible functional orthologue of serpinb <dig> is evident in the urochordate species ciona intestinalis . however, this gene does not contain any introns, although other serpin genes in the ciona genome do have introns. this makes it difficult to suggest the ciona serpinb <dig> gene as a primordial clade b serpin. furthermore, the suggestion that clade b serpins evolved from an intronless precursor would also be contrary to a recent study suggesting that they arose from an intron-containing gene  <cit> .

the question of where clade b genes arose may be answered when the genomes of the skate and lamprey are completely sequenced. these species diverged at different times between the sea squirt-human and fish-human common ancestors, and may indicate which gene, serpinb <dig> or serpinb <dig>  evolved first, and whether or not clade b serpins are descendant from an intronless precursor.

CONCLUSIONS
by investigating the genomes of various vertebrate species, we have shown that the all clade b serpins are descended from a single gene  that contained seven exons. the additional exon present in the 8-exon structure appeared in the serpinb <dig> gene at some point after the divergence of amphibians from amniotes, but before the divergence of birds and mammals. therefore, both the 7-exon and 8-exon genes evolved at a single locus that split soon after birds and mammals diverged two yield the two loci present in the human genome.
