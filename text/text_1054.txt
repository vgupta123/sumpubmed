BACKGROUND
members of the egr  family of transactivators fulfill critical roles in diverse systems, including nervous system development, bone formation, and fertility. transcriptional activity of three egr family members  is regulated by interaction with the nab  family of transcriptional corepressors. the nab <dig> protein was first identified by screening a yeast two-hybrid library for proteins that interact with a repressive domain within egr <dig> <cit> , and nab <dig> was subsequently found to share similar properties  <cit> . both nab <dig> and nab <dig> can bind to a conserved domain in egr <dig>  egr <dig> and egr <dig>  nab proteins repress activation of several egr target promoters  <cit> , and the repression mechanism involves interaction with the chd <dig> subunit of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase  complex  <cit> .

the most severe phenotypes caused by loss of egr function have been found in mice lacking the egr2/krox <dig> gene . characterization of these mice revealed three principal defects: 1) defective hindbrain segmentation with the loss of rhombomeres r <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> , 2) defective bone formation  <cit> , and 3) failure of schwann cells to myelinate peripheral nerves  <cit> . target genes regulated by egr <dig> in schwann cells include myelin genes such as myelin protein zero and myelin-associated glycoprotein  <cit> . as a consequence, most mice with a homozygous egr <dig> disruption die shortly after birth, although mice that are homozygous for a hypomorphic egr <dig> allele survive somewhat longer  <cit> .

because of the myelination defect in peripheral nerves of egr <dig> knockout mice, several groups have screened human patients with peripheral neuropathies for mutations in the egr <dig> gene. mutations in egr <dig> have been identified in several patients with myelin disorders, such as charcot-marie-tooth  disease, dejerine-sottas syndrome, and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy  <cit> . most of the neuropathy-associated mutations occur within the zinc fingers of egr <dig> and prevent dna-binding  <cit> . however, one of the egr <dig> mutations associated with a very severe congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy  prevents binding of egr <dig> to nab corepressors  <cit> . the importance of nab corepressors to the regulation of peripheral nerve myelination by egr <dig> was recently confirmed by the demonstration that a double knockout of the nab1/nab <dig> genes results in a phenotype very similar to that of the egr <dig> knockout: early lethality and peripheral neuropathy resulting from arrested myelination  <cit> . moreover, nab genes have been implicated in several other physiological processes, including macrophage development, cardiac hypertrophy, prostate carcinogenesis, and feedback regulation involved in hindbrain development  <cit> .

as critical regulators of peripheral myelination, it is important to probe the mechanism of nab regulation. recent work has shown that nab <dig> and nab <dig> are induced by neuregulin signaling  <cit> . neuregulin signaling plays an extremely important role in axon-derived signals for schwann cell myelination  <cit> . moreover, egr <dig> and nab expression appear to be closely linked, as nab <dig> and nab <dig> are co-regulated with egr <dig> after nerve crush injury, and both corepressors are induced by ectopic egr <dig> expression in cultured schwann cells  <cit> . however, direct regulation of nab <dig> and nab <dig> by egr <dig> has not been demonstrated in vivo. the following data demonstrate direct regulation of nab expression by egr <dig> in myelinating sciatic nerve, and indicate that other neuregulin-regulated pathways are specifically involved in inducing nab <dig> expression.

RESULTS
induction of nab promoters by egr2
sequence analysis of the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters identified several conserved motifs that resemble egr <dig> binding sites  <cit> . to test whether these sites bind egr <dig>  the mouse nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters were analyzed by dnase i footprinting. in the presence of recombinant egr <dig>  there were strongly protected regions encompassing three previously identified sites in the nab <dig> promoter, as well as some weaker protections . interestingly, previous analysis of egr <dig> site specificity indicated a strong preference for t in the 4th position of the consensus sequence , and each of the three strongly protected sites have a t in the 4th base. a similar analysis of the mouse nab <dig> promoter  confirmed binding of egr <dig> to the conserved binding sites identified previously  <cit> . the strong binding site at the 3' end of the mouse nab <dig> promoter corresponds to a site of phorbol ester-induced egr <dig> binding in a recent analysis of the human nab <dig> promoter using electrophoretic mobility shift assays  <cit> .

to test the function of the egr <dig> binding sites, fragments encompassing the conserved regions of the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters were fused to a luciferase reporter gene and transfected into jeg- <dig> cells, which exhibit a low level of expression of egr proteins  <cit> . as shown in figure 1c, expression of egr <dig> activated the nab <dig> promoter up to 15-fold, and the nab <dig> reporter was increased 25-fold. two of the egr <dig> binding sites in the nab <dig> promoter were mutated to determine how that would affect activation by egr <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig>  we still observed some residual activation of the promoter, but the induction was much less than observed with the wild type promoter. previous work had indicated that nab <dig> is more inducible by serum and neuregulin than nab <dig>  <cit> . moreover, the nab <dig> promoter was more highly induced by egr <dig> in the transfection experiments. however, this disparity is somewhat surprising, given that the nab <dig> promoter contains more egr <dig> binding sites than does nab <dig> 

neuregulin stimulation increases egr <dig> occupancy of the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters
in rat schwann cells treated with neuregulin, there is a large induction of egr <dig> , followed by a delayed induction of nab <dig> and nab <dig>  which peaks at two hours after neuregulin addition  <cit> , with nab <dig> being more highly induced than nab <dig>  to test if neuregulin stimulates direct binding of egr <dig> to the nab promoters, chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays were used, in which formaldehyde is used to covalently crosslink dna with any associated proteins and the proteins of interest are subsequently immunoprecipitated  <cit> . primary rat schwann cells were treated for  <dig> hours with neuregulin and then cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde. sonicated chromatin was then immunoprecipitated with an egr <dig> antibody or control igg. an untreated culture of schwann cells was also cross-linked and immunoprecipitated similarly. after crosslinks were reversed, purified dna was analyzed by quantitative pcr using primer sets proximal to the egr <dig> binding sites in the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters. as shown in figure  <dig>  binding of egr <dig> to the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters was significantly stimulated upon treatment with neuregulin. egr <dig> binding was not detected at an immunoglobulin promoter  in either sample. evidence for the specificity of the antibody used for chip analysis includes induction of egr <dig> binding by neuregulin , and immunoblot analysis using this antibody reveals a band of the correct size . in addition, this antibody has been extensively tested with multiple negative control sites  <cit> , and expression of dominant negative egr <dig>  reduces egr <dig> binding in this assay . in parallel cultures, nab <dig> mrna was induced 11-fold upon treatment with neuregulin for  <dig> hours, consistent with previously published results  <cit> .

egr <dig> binds to the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters in myelinating sciatic nerve
we have recently employed chip analysis of myelinating sciatic nerve to test whether egr <dig> directly regulates specific elements in vivo  <cit> . egr <dig> expression increases concurrently with initiation of myelination in rat sciatic nerve within two weeks after birth  <cit> , which is also observed in immunoblot analysis of egr <dig> expression in p <dig> and p <dig> rat sciatic nerve . therefore, freshly dissected sciatic nerves from rat pups at p <dig>  were minced in 1% formaldehyde after dissection. after immunoprecipitation of sonicated chromatin, quantitation of the chip assays demonstrated significant enrichment of egr <dig> at both nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters in rat sciatic nerve .

nab expression levels in peripheral nerve of egr2-deficient mice
to independently test the regulation of nab genes by egr <dig> in vivo, we examined nab expression levels in the egr2/krox <dig> knockout . in these mice, schwann cells develop normally and associate with axons, but fail to initiate myelination of peripheral nerves  <cit> . the sciatic nerves of seventeen wild type and knockout animals at p <dig> were pooled, and the levels of nab <dig> and nab <dig> were determined by quantitative pcr. previous analysis of these samples had indicated that expression of many myelin-associated egr <dig> target genes are significantly reduced in the knockout nerves  <cit> . consistent with the data from the transfection and chip assays, we observed a significant decrease in the expression of nab <dig>  a similar reduction in nab <dig> expression was reported in mice with a hypomorphic allele of egr <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, the expression level of nab <dig> was not significantly different in mice containing the null allele of egr2/krox <dig> 

regulation of the nab <dig> promoter by ets proteins
given the unexpected finding that the expression level of nab <dig> was not lower in the absence of egr <dig>  the nab <dig> promoter was screened for other transcription factor binding sites that could contribute to nab <dig> expression, thereby compensating for the loss of egr <dig> activation. analysis of the nab <dig> promoter revealed several putative binding sites for ets transcription factors . interestingly, ets proteins are regulated by neuregulin signaling  <cit> . in addition, previous studies have identified ets transcription factors as playing an important role in autocrine and neuregulin-mediated survival of schwann cells, and showed that several ets genes, including net/elk <dig>  ets <dig>  gabpα and etv1/er <dig>  are expressed in e <dig> and newborn mouse peripheral nerve  <cit> . ets <dig> and etv1/er <dig>  were selected for further analysis as they were highly expressed in microarray analyses of mouse sciatic nerve . quantitative pcr analysis confirmed significant levels of ets <dig> and etv <dig> in mouse and rat sciatic nerves during peripheral nerve myelination , and western analysis  showed that both ets <dig> and etv <dig> are developmentally increased in rat sciatic nerve at p <dig>  compared to the p <dig>  timepoint. since nab <dig> expression was unaffected in the egr <dig> knockout, we assessed the expression levels of ets <dig>  etv <dig>  and elk <dig> in egr <dig> knockout nerves from p <dig> mice. interestingly, ets <dig> expression was previously shown to be elevated in sciatic nerve of egr2-deficient mice  <cit> , and etv <dig> expression was somewhat higher in the egr <dig> null mice as compared to wild-type mice . the presence of ets <dig> and etv <dig> in mouse and rat sciatic nerve during myelination  <cit> , as well as in egr <dig> null mice, suggest that ets transcription factors could compensate in the absence of egr <dig> to maintain nab <dig> expression levels.

ets proteins activate the nab <dig> promoter
to test whether ets proteins activate the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters, jeg <dig> cells were transfected with the nab <dig> or nab <dig> reporters described above, along with expression vectors for ets <dig> and etv <dig>  western analysis revealed that ets <dig> and etv <dig> expression in jeg <dig> cells is much lower than found in the s16y schwann cell line . the nab <dig> promoter was significantly induced by ets <dig> and etv <dig> expression, and this induction was further potentiated by coexpression of egr <dig> . a dominant-negative ets construct  specifically interfered with ets-mediated induction of the promoter and had no effect on activation by egr <dig> . in contrast, the nab <dig> promoter was activated to a lower extent by ets <dig> and etv <dig>  and the ets factors did not appear to augment activation of the nab <dig> promoter by egr <dig> 

we tested the ability of ets <dig> and etv <dig> to induce a mutated version of the nab <dig> promoter construct containing mutations in two of the egr <dig> binding sites . as observed previously, the mutant promoter is only weakly induced by egr <dig>  however, ets <dig> and etv <dig> were nonetheless able to induce this mutant reporter in the absence of egr <dig>  although the synergistic activation observed with egr <dig> was clearly diminished in the mutant promoter.

ets <dig> binds to the nab <dig> promoter in s16y schwann cells
in order to test if ets factors directly regulate nab <dig> in schwann cells, we carried out chip assays in the s16y schwann cell line  <cit> , which expresses significant levels of nab <dig>  nab <dig>  and ets factors . s16y cells were crosslinked in 1% formaldehyde and sonicated chromatin was immunoprecipitated with either an affinity purified ets <dig> antibody  or an igg control antibody. quantitative pcr was carried out on purified dna with primer sets in the nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters, and the img2a locus as a negative control. as shown in figure  <dig>  we observed significant enrichment of ets <dig> using two primer sets in the nab <dig> promoter, whereas binding of ets <dig> was not detected at either the nab <dig> promoter or the img2a negative control locus. a similar trend in ets <dig> occupancy was observed in the s <dig> schwann cell line .

one limitation of the chip assay is that it cannot be used to precisely localize binding of transcription factors. however, the analysis suggests that ets <dig> binding is separable from egr <dig>  because ets <dig> binding was not detected using the primer set  that was used previously to detect binding of egr <dig> within the nab <dig> promoter . in addition, the relatively simple recognition site of ets factors  does not make sequence analysis necessarily predictive, since the upstream cluster of putative ets binding sites  does not appear to bind ets <dig>  accordingly, deletion of the upstream cluster of putative ets binding sites does not affect activation of the nab <dig> promoter in transfection assays . ets <dig> binding appears to occur in two separable regions of the nab <dig> promoter, as detected by primer sets  <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, primer set  <dig> overlaps with the corresponding segment of the human nab <dig> promoter that was recently shown to be inducible by phorbol ester  <cit> , which also activates ets proteins. overall, these data are consistent with regulation of the nab <dig> promoter by ets transactivators in vivo.

discussion
recent studies have shown that nab proteins are required for peripheral nerve myelination by schwann cells, as mice lacking nab1/nab <dig> displayed a severe congenital hypomyelinating phenotype similar to egr <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . the molecular roles of egr <dig> and nab proteins appear to be closely intertwined at several levels, including both physical interaction and coregulation  <cit> . several previous studies have suggested that egr factors regulate the expression of nab <dig> and nab <dig> corepressors. first, nab <dig> and, to a lesser extent, nab <dig> are activated in a delayed early fashion by a variety of stimuli that induce expression of egr family members  <cit> . for example, neuregulin treatment of schwann cells stimulates egr <dig> and activates nab <dig> and nab <dig> expression in a slightly delayed manner  <cit> . second, the nab <dig> promoter can be activated by egr factors in transient transfection studies , and ectopic expression of egr <dig> and egr <dig> stimulates expression of endogenous nab <dig> and nab <dig> in a variety of cell lines, including schwann cells  <cit> .

these earlier studies, however, did not test direct regulation of nab corepressors by egr <dig>  our data provide several lines of evidence to establish nab <dig> regulation by egr <dig> in vivo. first, dnase footprinting analysis identified several egr <dig> protected sites in both nab <dig> and nab <dig> promoters. second, activation of nab <dig> by egr <dig> in transient transfection assays was severely compromised when egr <dig> binding sites were mutated . finally, chip assays demonstrated direct binding of egr <dig> to both promoters in cultured schwann cells as well as myelinating sciatic nerve . several studies have implicated neuregulin signaling as a critical factor in schwann cell survival and stimulation of myelination  <cit> . egr <dig> occupancy at both nab <dig> and nab <dig> was significantly enhanced upon neuregulin stimulation of schwann cells. our results provide the first demonstration of neuregulin-induced binding of a transcription factor to a specific promoter in schwann cells.

several groups have shown that type iii neuregulin  plays a central role in regulating myelination in vivo  <cit> . therefore, addition of soluble neuregulin  does not act as a mimic of myelination. nonetheless, egr <dig> is regulated by both soluble neuregulin and interaction with type iii neuregulin  <cit> , and therefore soluble neuregulin probably induces some of the early pathways relating to egr <dig> induction in vivo. since egr <dig> expression is regulated by type iii neuregulin signaling in vivo  <cit> , our chip data in myelinating rat sciatic nerve presumably reflect type iii neuregulin-dependent binding of egr <dig> to the nab promoters.

previous work showed that expression of nab <dig> and nab <dig> in zebrafish hindbrain is dependent on egr <dig> expression  <cit> . therefore, it was surprising that nab <dig> levels were not affected in egr <dig> knockout mice. in contrast, nab <dig> levels were significantly lower in the absence of egr <dig>  even though the nab <dig> promoter is less effectively activated by neuregulin and egr <dig> expression . these data suggested that nab <dig> might be coregulated by other factors that compensate for loss of egr <dig>  and promoter analysis revealed several conserved binding sites for ets transcription factors. ets family members are activated by neuregulin signaling  <cit> . since nab <dig> is more highly induced by neuregulin stimulation  <cit> , we tested whether ets proteins are involved in regulation of nab <dig> 

both ets <dig> and etv <dig> activated the nab <dig> promoter in transfection assays, and we observed a cooperative effect on the nab <dig> promoter when egr <dig> was co-expressed together with ets <dig> or etv <dig>  furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis with an ets <dig> antibody detected binding in the nab <dig> promoter, but not in the nab <dig> promoter. unfortunately, we have been unable to find an etv <dig> antibody that is suitable for chip analysis, but recent immunohistochemical studies indicate that etv1/er <dig> is expressed in schwann cells  <cit> . based on our data, we propose that the higher induction of nab <dig> by neuregulin, compared to nab <dig>  <cit> , is due to synergistic activation of the nab <dig> promoter by egr <dig> and ets factors. consequently, the maintained expression of nab <dig> levels in the knockout could be mediated by elevated levels of etv <dig> , ets <dig>  <cit> , or other ets factors that may be revealed by a more comprehensive analysis of family member expression. in addition, although ets <dig> mrna is not induced in the egr <dig> knockout, its activity  could be elevated post-transcriptionally .

in contrast, the nab <dig> promoter was more modestly activated by ets proteins, suggesting that nab <dig> is more exclusively dependent on egr factors and consequently is more reduced in the absence of egr <dig>  however, the modest induction of the nab <dig> promoter by ets factors in transfection assays could reflect some level of regulation of nab <dig> expression by ets proteins in schwann cells, particularly if there are other ets binding sites that lie outside of the nab <dig> promoter regions we have analyzed. a limitation of these studies is that the importance of the nab promoters relative to more remote enhancer elements has not been established. the mechanism of nab <dig> activation by ets remains to be determined, since only potential ets binding sites in the nab <dig> promoter have been identified. despite the commonality of the core ets motif , individual ets factors have distinct binding site preferences. therefore, future studies will focus on identifying the relevant ets factor using rnai approaches and/or knockout mice in order to facilitate such a mechanistic analysis.

given the in vivo evidence that ets proteins regulate expression of egr <dig> and egr <dig>  <cit> , it seems likely that co-induction of egr <dig> and nab <dig> by ets transcription factor activation may have evolved to ensure formation of sufficient egr2/nab complexes that are required for specific gene regulation events in schwann cell differentiation. this may also prevent inappropriate activation of some target genes if nab <dig> was not immediately present at the onset of egr <dig> induction. alternatively, it is possible that nab <dig> modulates other transcription factors, so that its induction should not exclusively depend on egr <dig> 

several groups have proposed that the induction of nab <dig> constitutes a negative feedback loop in which egr activators induce expression of their own corepressor  <cit> . our studies refine this model by showing that other neuregulin-regulated pathways direct nab <dig> expression. in addition, recent publications have shown that egr <dig> is required for certain gene repression mechanisms during myelination  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that the induction of nab proteins does not merely constitute a negative feedback loop, but rather, that co-induction of egr <dig> and nab proteins by axon-dependent signals  is required to form an egr2/nab complex that actively represses transcription of specific genes during peripheral nerve myelination . these results are consistent with our demonstration of direct repression of the rad gene by an egr2/nab complex in schwann cells  <cit> , as well as recent publications implicating repression by the egr2/nab complex in macrophages and cardiomyocytes  <cit> .

our studies do not rule out the possibility that other egr family members and/or other zinc finger proteins may partially compensate in maintaining nab <dig> levels in the absence of egr <dig>  indeed, previous work has shown that egr <dig> and egr2/krox <dig> are coexpressed in schwann cells at the onset of myelination . in contrast by one month of age, egr <dig> is exclusively expressed in myelinating schwann cells, whereas egr <dig> is confined to nonmyelinating schwann cells  <cit> . egr <dig> is induced ~2-fold in sciatic nerve of mice homozygous for a hypomorphic egr <dig> allele  <cit> , and our analysis indicates that egr <dig> mrna is induced about  <dig> -fold in the complete absence of egr <dig> . importantly, compensation by other egr family members is not sufficient to maintain nab <dig> levels despite the presence of several egr <dig> binding sites, and fails to maintain expression of other egr <dig> target genes like myelin protein zero, which is reduced up to 50-fold in the krox20/egr <dig> knockout  <cit> , suggesting that non-egr factors contribute significantly to regulation of nab <dig> expression. interestingly, regulation of nab expression by egr <dig> is consistent with previous observations that nab <dig> and nab <dig> are co-regulated with egr <dig> after nerve crush injury  <cit> . however, the decrease in nab <dig> expression following nerve injury would be consistent not only with regulation by egr <dig>  but also by loss of neuregulin-dependent  induction of ets factors, analogous to regulation of ets factors by neuregulin signaling observed in other systems  <cit> .

the involvement of ets transcription factors in nab <dig> regulation resolves several puzzling observations regarding nab <dig> and nab <dig> activation. first, nab <dig> expression is more responsive than nab <dig> to several stimuli including serum, neuregulin and ngf  <cit> , even though the nab <dig> promoter contains more egr binding sites than nab <dig>  second, nab <dig> expression is already fairly elevated by e <dig> in profiling studies of peripheral nerve myelination, even though egr <dig> levels do not peak until p <dig>  <cit> . finally, a recent analysis of hematopoietic development showed that expression of the ets factor, pu. <dig>  induced expression of both egr <dig> and nab <dig>  and the induction of nab <dig> was shown to be egr2-independent  <cit> . our analysis of the nab <dig> promoter provides a mechanism for egr2-independent activation of nab <dig> by ets proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that egr <dig> is directly involved in regulation of both nab <dig> and nab <dig> corepressors, indicating that axon-dependent induction of nab expression is partially dependent on egr <dig>  however, the maintained expression of nab <dig> in egr <dig> deficient mice suggested that other factors could compensate for lack of egr <dig>  transfection experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that ets <dig> and etv <dig> specifically activate the nab <dig> promoter, but not nab <dig>  which provides an explanation for the differential regulation of nab corepressors in several developmental systems. finally, these results suggest that nab corepressors are not simply feedback inhibitors, but that co-induction of egr <dig> with nab corepressors is critically involved in forming a transcriptional complex required for gene regulation events.
