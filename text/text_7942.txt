BACKGROUND
the notch signaling pathway is a highly connected and tightly regulated signal transduction network that drives developmental processes in all metazoans. notch signaling controls cell lineage decisions in tissues derived from all three primary germ lines: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm thus playing an essential role in organogenesis  <cit> .

both receptors and ligands are membrane-bound proteins, which normally restricts signaling to adjacent cells. jagged- <dig>  one of the five notch ligands identified in man, is a single pass type i membrane protein with a large extracellular region made of a poorly characterized n-terminal region, a dsl  domain, a series of  <dig> epidermal growth factor  tandem repeats, and a cysteine-rich juxtamembrane region . the dsl domain, together with the first two atypical egf repeats constitutes jagged- <dig> receptor binding region  <cit> .

we previously showed  <cit>  that a peptide corresponding to egf <dig> of human jagged- <dig>  cannot be refolded in vitro in the standard oxidative folding conditions used for other egfs. as exon  <dig> of the jag <dig> gene encodes not only egf <dig> but also part of egf <dig>  we speculated that exon  <dig> might encode an autonomously folding unit. we thus prepared a longer peptide encompassing the c-terminal part of egf <dig> and the entire egf <dig> . this peptide, j1ex <dig> , could be readily refolded in vitro and was shown to yield a folded unit with a disulfide bond topology typical of egf repeats  <cit> . we concluded that exon  <dig> encodes an autonomously folding unit, but whether the n-terminal overhang is only required for folding, acting as an internal chaperone in the reshuffling of disulfide bonds, or it is integral part of a structural unit encompassing the egf <dig> c-terminal region and egf <dig> remained an open issue.

we report here the solution structure of j1ex <dig> determined by 1h-nmr spectroscopy and demonstrate that exon  <dig> actually defines an egf-like structural unit with an additional disulfide-linked loop in the n-terminal overhang. we show that the structure of this unit, in spite of the minimal structural context, is very close to the conformation of the same region in a larger construct comprising the dsl and the first three egf repeats, for which the crystal structure has been recently determined  <cit> . the exon/intron organization of this region is very well conserved in this class of notch ligands, which leads us to speculate on the evolution of this structurally peculiar and functionally relevant region.

RESULTS
the solution structure of j1ex <dig> was determined by 1h nmr spectroscopy  . disulfide bonds were experimentally determined by targeted proteolysis and ms analysis in a three-step strategy that lead to the unambiguous assignment of the disulfide topology, and they were explicitly used in structure calculations as distance constraints. the overall fold of j1ex <dig> is mainly dictated by the four disulfide bonds and lacks well defined secondary structure elements, as well as a true hydrophobic core . the mean pairwise rmsd values for the backbone and all heavy atoms  are  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å  from the first to the last half-cystine ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å  for the n-terminal overhang , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å  for the core egf <dig> repeat . the distribution of psi/phi angles in the ramachandran map for the  <dig> selected models is:  <dig> % in most favored regions,  <dig> % in additionally allowed regions,  <dig> % in generously allowed regions, and  <dig> % in disallowed regions. whereas the availability of heteronuclear nmr data would have probably improved the precision of the models, the results for the psi/phi distribution are in line with the statistics for a set of  <dig> nmr structures of single and tandem egf repeats deposited at the pdb . it is thus possible that the sub-optimal distribution of psi/phi angles in the ramachandran map of egf repeats is a consequence of the constraints dictated by the disulfide bonds.

it was proposed that egf domains can be divided in two structural groups, human egfs  and c1r-like egfs , depending on the location of the last half-cystine in the structure  <cit> . using the anbnacbccncc annotation to describe the disulfide bond topology, where anac, bnbc, cncc are the three disulfides, these two groups also display different lengths of the cn-cc loop, of the bn-ac loop, and of the linker connecting two egfs of the same type. a comparison between different spacings in j1ex <dig> and in a set of  <dig> egfs of known structure  shows that j1ex <dig> can be clustered together with the hegfs for certain characteristics, such as the length of the cn-cc loop , while for others it clusters neither with cegfs nor with hegfs. notably, the bn-bc loop  is shorter than in cegfs  and in hegfs , as well as the total spacing between the first and the last half-cystine  and the linker between egf <dig> and egf <dig> . overall, this makes j1ex <dig> rather more constrained than cegfs and hegfs. an exhaustive search of structural databases with the j1ex <dig> structure did not produce any hit with a significant score.

surprisingly, the n-terminal overhang was found to be conformationally restrained and packs onto the following egf <dig> unit. the interaction between the n-terminal overhang and the egf <dig> repeat is mediated by a series of hydrophobic residues . this suggests that, even in solution, the egf1- <dig> module is quite rigid.

recently, the crystal structure of the region encompassing the dsl and the first three egf repeats of jagged- <dig> has been reported  <cit>  . a comparison between the solution structure of j1ex <dig> and the structure of the same region in the x-ray structure shows a good agreement in the tracing of the backbone . the backbone rmsd between the x-ray structure and the  <dig> models of the solution structure varies between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, with an average value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å, the largest difference being observed in the region 267– <dig>  interestingly, the conformation of the n-terminal overhang in the solution structure of j1ex <dig> is very close to that adopted by the corresponding segment in the crystal structure of the dsl/egf1- <dig> tandem domains, with an average rmsd of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  Å for the region 253– <dig> . these results confirm that exon  <dig> of the human jag <dig> gene is actually encoding a structural unit containing three disulfide bonds with an egf-like topology and an additional disulfide bond that is n-terminal to the egf domain, rather than c-terminal as in laminin egf-like domains.

furthermore, in the crystal structure of the dsl/egf1- <dig> modules  <cit> , a kink is present between egf <dig> and egf <dig> in an otherwise linear, rod-like structure . because this construct crystallized as a dimer with several interchain contacts, it can be questioned if packing forces are responsible for the bending of the chain. on the other hand, the good agreement between the crystal structure and the solution structure, in particular in the n-terminal overhang, and despite the reduced structural context, suggests that the kink is actually a structural feature that might have some functional relevance.

to find out if the dephasing of exon boundaries with respect to predicted domain boundaries in the region comprising these two atypical egf repeats is accidental, or might underlie some common evolutionary origin, we analyzed the exon/intron organization of human jag <dig> orthologues in  <dig> different species including primates , non-primate mammals , birds , amphibians , and fishes . the exon/intron arrangement in this region of the jag <dig> genes is very well conserved throughout evolution, with a single exon encoding the c-terminal region of egf <dig> and the complete egf <dig> . the extension of this analysis to all homologues of notch ligands showed that the same exonic organization is found not only in jag <dig> but also in the jag <dig>  dll <dig>  dll <dig>  dlk <dig>  and dlk <dig> gene families, for a total of  <dig> genes in species varying from fishes to primates, and only three exceptions found, all in lower organisms . usually, exon  <dig>  is flanked by a phase  <dig> and a phase  <dig> intron on the 5' and 3' ends, respectively.

discussion
early on in  <dig> it was proposed that exons encode "folded protein units", emphasizing the role of a correct folding process to produce functional proteins or domains  <cit> . recent advances in genome sequencing, domain classification, and 3d structure determination confirmed this hypothesis: a strong correlation between exon boundaries and predicted domain boundaries has been found in nine eukaryotic genomes, the correlation becoming stronger as the genome complexity becomes higher  <cit> . such a high correlation lead to the suggestion that in certain cases exon boundaries can be used to predict domain limits more accurately  <cit> . in particular, a survey of domain repeats in seven metazoan species showed that there is a very good correspondence between exons and egf repeats   <cit> . in the case reported here, exon boundaries do not coincide with the expected egf domain limits. although it can be argued that in some instances domain limits cannot be defined precisely, this is not the case of egf repeats, which are clearly recognizable by a very specific pattern of the three disulfide bonds and by the spacing between half-cystines. in this case study, the overall correspondence is maintained, with exons  <dig> and  <dig> encoding egf <dig> and  <dig>  but exon and domain boundaries are clearly out of phase, with exon  <dig> encoding a truncated egf with only four half-cystines and exon  <dig> encoding the c-terminal half of egf <dig> and the entire egf <dig>  furthermore, this peculiar exon/intron organization seems to be well conserved throughout evolution. how can these results be reconciled with the experimental finding that exon  <dig> of human jag <dig> is encoding an autonomously folding and structural unit? although from the statistical point of view this may be one of the rare instances where the 1: <dig> correspondence between exons and egf repeat does not hold, the question remains if this has any structural or functional significance. it is possible that the particular exon structure in this region is dictated by folding and structural requirements. in this specific case, the constraints in the atypically short egf <dig> repeat might require the n-terminal extension as an internal chaperone and a docking template to drive the correct folding.

furthermore, the interface between egf <dig> and egf <dig> drives the relative orientation of the egf1- <dig> tandem repeats and may have a functional role. it was shown that deletion of the dsl domain in a jagged- <dig> construct abolishes binding to notch  <cit> . whereas the dsl domain is necessary for binding, it is not sufficient. a construct containing the mnnl region and the dsl domain binds only weakly, while addition of the egf1- <dig> restores full binding  <cit> . although the structural determinants of the interaction between dsl ligands and notch receptors are not known in detail yet, the presence of a kink at the interface between egf <dig> and egf <dig> observed in the crystal structure of the jagged- <dig> region comprising the dsl domain and the first three egf repeats  <cit>  might not be accidental and may be required for correct binding to notch receptors. in calcium binding egfs, which are connected by a fairly long linker, the relative orientation of two adjacent domains is mainly determined by the geometric constraints imposed by the coordination of the calcium ion. in egf1- <dig>  the same objective is achieved by drastically reducing the length of the linker region and encoding the c-terminal part of egf <dig> and egf <dig> in a single, conserved exon.

it has been proposed that the dsl domain may have evolved from the truncation of tandemly connected, short egf domains  <cit> . in fact, j1ex <dig> in itself can be viewed as two truncated tandem egfs, and the sequence and disulfide pattern similarities between the dsl domain and j1ex <dig> are actually significant . one might then ask whether there is any evolutionary relationship between the two or, in other words, if the dsl domain and j1ex <dig> might have arisen from duplication of a common ancestor followed by divergent evolution and loss of one disulfide linkage in the dsl domain. if this hypothesis is true, one should be able to identify a primitive precursor where either the dsl or j1ex <dig> is missing. indeed, we identified the non-canonical notch ligands dlk <dig> and dlk <dig> as hits sharing with jag <dig> a high sequence similarity and the same exon organization in the region comprising egf <dig> and  <dig>  interestingly, these proteins lack the dsl domain, and this makes them good candidates as precursors of canonical notch ligands. however, dlk <dig> and  <dig> are found only in vertebrates, and not in more primitive organisms such as nematodes and insects. . furthermore, the dsl domain is made not only of a cysteine-rich region, but also of a more variable n-terminal region that is usually encoded by the same exon. the genome of the microbal eukaryote monosiga brevicollis, one of the closest primitive relatives of metazoans, has been recently sequenced and revealed some archetypal features of notch signaling  <cit> . domains that are typical of notch receptor proteins, such as notch/lin, ankyrin, and egf repeats are already present, although in distinct proteins and not arranged in the same domain architecture as in metazoan notch proteins, but not homologues of notch ligands. we were not able as well to detect any homologue of the dsl domain in the genome of m. brevicollis, but we found several hits corresponding to short egf repeats. in conclusion, currently available data still do not provide strong evidence of an evolutionary relationship between the dsl domain and j1ex <dig>  but are in support of a later appearance of the dsl domain with respect to the short egf repeats. the unusual exon architecture of the region comprising the egf <dig> and egf <dig> repeats might have arisen from the insertion of an intron in a common precursor encoding both egf <dig> and egf <dig>  and then conserved during the evolution of metazoans, together with the amino acid sequence.

CONCLUSIONS
in eukaryotic genomes, there is an overall very good correspondence between exon boundaries and predicted domain limits  <cit> . we report a case study where this correspondence is not fulfilled, and show that the autonomously folding, structural unit is defined by exon boundaries, rather than by predicted domain boundaries. although this conclusion cannot be taken as a general rule, this study suggests that, together with domain boundaries and predicted secondary structure, exon boundaries may also be taken into account when designing constructs for structural studies. this option should be carefully considered especially when dealing with protein regions for which no similarity with known domains can be detected. these regions, also called "orphan domains", account for as much as ~15% of the eukaryotic proteomes  <cit> , while an additional ~30% is made of poorly characterized regions such as those belonging to the pfam-b families  <cit> .
