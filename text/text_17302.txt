BACKGROUND
actinobacteria constitute one of the main phyla within the bacteria and they are highly diverse in terms of their morphology, physiology and ecology  <cit> . these bacteria are characterized by high g+c content   <cit>  and a monoderm cell structure  <cit> . they include streptomyces, the major antibiotic producers in the pharmaceutical industry as well as many important human, animal and plant pathogens, such as mycobacterium, tropheryma, nocardia, propionibacterium, leifsonia, etc. however, except for their clustering in the 16s rrna tree, no molecular, biochemical or physiological characteristics are known that can clearly distinguish species belonging to the phylum actinobacteria from other bacteria  <cit> .

comparative analyses of genomic sequences are enabling identification of novel genetic characteristics that are unique to different groups of bacteria. large numbers of proteins and conserved indels  that are specific for various prokaryotic groups such as archaea, chlamydiae, bacteriodetes-chlorobi, proteobacteria, etc. have been identified  <cit> . our recent comparative genomic studies on available actinobacterial genomes have identified a large number of proteins that are either specific for all actinobacterial species or certain subgroups within this phylum  <cit> . blast searches with these proteins show no significant hits or similarity to any other protein in the databases. these proteins thus provide novel and useful molecular markers for this diverse group of bacteria  <cit> . among these actinobacteria-specific proteins, five proteins  were found in every sequenced actinobacterial species  <cit>  including those from the deepest branch rubrobacter xylanophilus and also from intracellular pathogens such as tropheryma whipplei which have highly reduced genomes  <cit> . all five of these proteins are conserved within actinobacteria but have no known function. these five actinobacteria-specific proteins are referred to in this work as asp- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the simplest and most logical explanation for the persistence of these proteins in only actinobacteria is that their genes evolved only once in a common ancestor of all actinobacteria and were subsequently passed on to all their decedents. so these genes/proteins provide among the very few molecular characteristics known that are distinctive of the actinobacteria phylum  <cit> . in view of their actinobacteria-specificity, it is of great interest to determine the cellular functions of these proteins and the cellular processes in which they participate. these studies are expected to provide novel insights into biochemical processes and physiological characteristics that are unique to actinobacteria.

in an attempt to gain insight into the cellular functions of these proteins, we have initiated structural work on these  <dig> actinobacteria-specific proteins. we report here the crystal structure of sco <dig> from s. coelicolor, which corresponds to the protein ml <dig> from m. leprae   <cit> . structural and phylogenetic analysis indicates that although asp <dig> retains a similar overall fold compared to members of the hydrolase superfamily such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase, the active site region and therefore function of asp <dig> are distinct  <cit> . comparison of the most highly conserved sequences of asp <dig> from different actinobacteria with their positions in the crystal structure reveals a potential role for asp <dig> in binding and transport of divalent metal ion. interestingly, additional sequence and structural analyses show that another actinobacteria-specific protein asp <dig>  is evolutionarily and functionally related to asp <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
crystal structure of asp <dig> from s. coelicolor
the protein asp- <dig> is of hypothetical or unknown function. the genes involved in related functions  are generally clustered in various species or closely related species. thus, genetic linkage studies can often provide valuable clues regarding possible cellular function of a given gene/protein  <cit> . hence, we have examined the neighboring genes of asp <dig> in various sequenced actinobacteria. the genes flanking asp <dig> in different actinobacterial genomes are either of unknown function or perform unrelated functions. the information for these flanking genes is presented in the additional file  <dig> and it provides no clue regarding the possible cellular function of this protein.

to gain insight into the cellular function of asp <dig>  we have cloned, expressed and crystallized the gene for this protein from s. coelicolor a <dig>  <cit> . the gene id and accession numbers of this protein from other actinobacterial genomes are provided in the additional file  <dig>  the crystal structure of full length asp <dig> was determined using seleno-methionine  derivatized asp <dig> and single anomalous diffraction  techniques. the final model was refined with native data  to r and rfree values of  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the structure of asp <dig> contained three regions that were unable to be traced into electron density and therefore not included in the final model. these disordered regions included the first  <dig> residues at the n-terminus, the last  <dig> c-terminal residues  as well as a short loop region encompassing residues 168– <dig>  a complete list of data collection and model refinement statistics can be found in table  <dig> 

a one crystal was used for data collection.

crystals grew in space group i <dig> and contained a single copy of asp <dig> in the asymmetric unit. upon inspection of crystallographic packing interactions it appeared that asp <dig> might exist as a trimer. the amount of surface area buried through the formation of an asp <dig> trimer is significant at  <dig> Ǻ <dig>  as well, when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography , asp <dig> eluted with a stokes radius consistent with a molecular mass equivalent to ~ <dig> kda , further supporting the idea that asp <dig> exists as a trimer in solution.

asp <dig> contains a single domain comprised of a central mixed β-sheet  flanked by  <dig> α-helices on one side and  <dig> on the other yielding an overall three layered αβα fold . helices f and g form an elbow-shaped extension that is peripheral to the core domain. based on secondary structure prediction of the missing  <dig> c-terminal residues, an additional or perhaps extended helix is expected to follow αg. trimer formation is largely stabilized by interactions between an extended anti-parallel hairpin  and the αd region from an adjacent monomer . a portion of the extended loop  preceding αd further stabilizes the trimer through interactions with β4– <dig>  resulting in formation of a 3-stranded anti-parallel sheet .

assembly of the asp <dig> trimer results in the formation of a roughly globular complex  with three notable features . first, one side of the trimer adopts a very flat surface, forming what could perhaps function as a large docking interface. the electrostatic potential on this surface is quite neutral having only a small amount of basic potential. a second unusual feature of the asp <dig> trimer is the presence of a large internal cavity  surrounded by a three-pronged claw-like structure. given the size of this cavity and overall claw-like structure that surrounds it, it is quite possible that this region acts as a binding surface for another protein and or substrate. the electrostatic surface potential of each claw is negative creating an overall acidic surface on the internal cavity region of asp <dig> 

the final and most notable feature of the asp <dig> trimer is the presence of two well ordered magnesium ions  located at a central pore formed along the central three fold symmetry axis. this pore is ~ <dig> Ǻ deep and is lined by six concentric rings of amino acids with alternating charge and polarity . the shape of the pore is conical and is tapered to its narrowest point of  <dig>  Ǻ at d <dig> located within the second layer. the first mg2+ ion is positioned just above a negative ring of amino acids formed by three copies of d <dig> and d <dig> . water molecules in the first hydration shell of this metal ion are directly hydrogen bonded to d <dig> . a second metal ion is located in a hydrophobic pocket lined by v <dig> at the third layer. water molecules within the first hydration shell of this metal ion are in direct van der waals contact with v <dig>  through its second hydration shell the second mg2+ is further stabilized by hydrogen bonding to d <dig> and also to the main chain carbonyl of r <dig>  because there was high concentration of mg2+ in the mother liquor , the specificity and possible role of this metal ion-bound, channel-like pore is unclear, but may be involved in the biological function of the asp <dig> trimer.

although it is tempting to speculate that the presence of two mg2+ ions in the central pore region of asp <dig> suggests a role for asp <dig> in metal transport, there is no direct evidence to support this idea. furthermore, a structural comparison of asp <dig> with cora, a well characterized mg2+ transporter whose homologs are present in s. coelicolor and various actinobacteria  <cit> , shows no obvious similarity between these proteins . therefore, if asp <dig> function does involve some aspect of mg2+ binding and/or transporter it does not appear to be similar to that conducted by cora.

structural comparisons of asp1
to further characterize the structure of asp <dig> and gain insight into its possible function, we performed a comparative structural analysis using the program dalilite version  <dig>  <cit> . this analysis revealed significant structural similarity to a homologue from corynebacterium glutamicum  , as well as several bacterial purine nucleoside phosphorylases and a number of other glycosidic hydrolases from the larger np- <dig> family.

comparison of asp <dig> from s. coelicolor and c. glutamicum
as expected, structural comparison of asp <dig> from s. coelicolor and c. glutamicum showed a high degree of conservation :  <dig>  Ǻ). importantly, the structure of asp <dig> from c. glutamicum crystallized as a trimer that is identical to the trimer reported here for asp <dig> from s. coelicolor. this finding, along with our gel filtration data, provides additional support for the trimeric structure of asp <dig> generated through crystallographic symmetry. another important observation from the comparison of the structure from c. glutamicum is the structural conservation of the metal binding pore despite the absence of bound metal ion. the fact that the pore region adopts an identical structure even when a metal ion is not present provides strong evidence to suggest that the binding of metal is not simply required for structure integrity of the asp <dig> trimer.

a comprehensive sequence alignment of asp <dig> homologues from a broad range of actinobacterial species  clearly demonstrates that residues contributing to the formation of two distinct regions  within the structure of asp <dig> represent the most highly conserved sequence of the protein . figure  <dig> illustrates the importance of conserved residues  in forming the pore and elbow regions. while most of these residues are involved in structural stabilization others, such as d <dig> and l <dig>  are not. as suggested elsewhere, absolutely conserved amino acids that do not directly contribute to structure stability and are solvent exposed, are expected to define key regions for protein function  <cit> . at this point it is difficult to infer what function the elbow region might serve. given its distal location, however, it seems likely to mediate interaction with other proteins or perhaps the missing c-terminal region of asp <dig>  the c-terminal region of asp <dig> contains a number of highly conserved residues . interestingly, this region is not observed in either of the currently available structures suggesting that it may only become ordered upon binding another molecule.

comparison of asp <dig> and pnp
as mentioned above, comparative structural analysis revealed significant similarity  between asp <dig> and members of the np- <dig> family of nucleoside phosphorylase enzymes. this family of enzymes participates in the salvage pathway of purines and pyrimidines biosynthesis and catalyzes the reversible phosphorolysis of purine and pyrimidine nucleosides  <cit> . the np- <dig> family member that shares greatest structural similarity to asp <dig> is purine nucleoside phosphorylase  from e. coli . despite having very low sequence similarity , asp <dig> and pnpe. coli structures could be aligned with an overall rmsd of ~ <dig>  Ǻ. with the exception of a few insertions and deletions, these proteins share identical overall topology . two notable insertions include: the c-terminal highly conserved elbow  and the extended arm region  essential for asp <dig> trimer stability. in addition, there is an insertion of sequence that significantly increases the loop size between αb-β <dig>  occluding much of the normal pnp substrate-binding surface . while these insertions are expected to contribute to asp <dig> function and certainly quaternary structure, members of the np- <dig> family are characterized by different oligomeric arrangements ranging from dimer, to trimer and in some instances hexameric structures. therefore, these observed differences do not necessarily preclude shared function between pnp and asp <dig> 

in contrast, the following evidence strongly suggests that asp <dig> does not function as a nucleoside phosphorylase. first, a large region of pnp responsible for forming an entire side of its active site cleft  is completely missing in the asp <dig> structure, rendering asp <dig> incompatible of binding nucleoside. second, a sequence alignment  of asp <dig> homologues fails to identify any of the highly conserved residues involved in substrate binding or catalysis within the np- <dig> family. furthermore, from sequence and structural alignments it is equally clear that those regions of asp <dig> which are most highly conserved, are not present within np- <dig> family members. finally, a pnp homologue in the s. coelicolor genome has already been identified  and shows no significant similarity to asp <dig>  taken together, the observations from both sequence and structural comparison indicate that while asp <dig> and pnp share similar overall structure and topology, their functions are different.

phylogenetic analysis of asp <dig> and asp2
of the five actinobacteria-specific genes previously identified through comparative genomic analysis of  <dig> actinobacterial species, two genes asp <dig>  and asp <dig>  appear to encode structurally related proteins  <cit> . these proteins have comparable length and share significant sequence similarity . the question remains, are these two conserved actinobacteria-specific proteins functionally related?

we have conducted a search for asp <dig> and asp <dig> homologues in all available sequenced actinobacterial genomes . interestingly, while most actinobacterial species contain homologues of both asp <dig> and asp <dig>  some species contain only one homologue. the single homologue by definition shares similarity to both asp <dig> and asp <dig> . species , which only contain one homologue, are found in  <dig> divergent genera . further phylogenetic analysis of asp <dig> and asp <dig> homologues from different actinobacterial species was conducted to determine how these two genes are related. in the phylogenetic tree shown in figure  <dig>  two distinct clusters are observed with a strong bootstrap score  indicating that the observed branch pattern is highly reliable. one cluster collected all genes homologous to asp <dig> while the other cluster, grouped only those genes homologous to asp <dig>  the genes from the  <dig> species containing only one homologue do not form a third branch, but rather fall into either the asp <dig> and asp <dig> clusters. the two distinct clusters observed in the phylogenetic tree suggest that asp <dig> and asp <dig> are paralogues that evolved from a gene duplication event in a common ancestor of actinobacteria. therefore, most members from this phylum contain both asp <dig> and asp <dig> except those species, which have lost one copy later in the evolutionary process. the fact that asp <dig> and asp <dig> are paralogues, yet either can be lost, suggests that these two paralogues perform similar functions. based on their sequence and functional similarity, these two proteins are also expected to share significant structural similarity. preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis indicates that the tertiary and quaternary structure of asp <dig> is in fact similar to asp <dig> .

sequence alignment of asp <dig> and asp <dig> homologues demonstrate that important residues which are highly conserved in asp <dig> homologues and likely involved in protein function are also conserved in asp <dig> homologues . as highlighted in additional file  <dig>   <dig> of the  <dig> absolutely conserved residues from asp <dig> homologues are also absolutely conserved amongst asp <dig> homologues. the remaining  <dig> are still highly conserved and are only substituted with similar amino acids . this finding further underscores the importance of these residues in mediating the function of both paralogs. as stated earlier, amino acids that fall within the category of absolutely conserved and solvent exposed are particularly predictive of regions important for mediating interactions with other functionally important molecules  <cit> . d <dig> is most interesting in this regard because it not only fits this category, but is also found bound to two magnesium ions in the asp <dig> structure. we know that the binding of magnesium is not required for overall structural stability since the structure of asp <dig> from c. glutamicum does not contain metal ion. the precise function of this region within asp <dig> and asp <dig> will require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
the actinobacteria phylum represents one of the largest groups of bacteria. amazingly this diverse collection of bacteria can be characterized genetically to a first approximation by the presence of only  <dig> unique genes. all of these  <dig> genes, are of unknown function but they are expected to encode for function that ultimately control actinobacteria-specific and important biological process. understanding the cellular function of a protein of unknown function is not a straightforward task  <cit> . however, structure determination often provides the most useful information in this regard  <cit> . in this work, we report the structure of the first actinobacteria-specific protein. our structural data in combination with sequence analysis further supports the idea that this protein carries out a novel function. this function is novel in the sense that the structure of this protein does not match any known protein, with or without known function. given the immense number of structures that are now available and the wide coverage of function, it is reasonable to propose that asp <dig> may mediate a function highly specific to actinobacteria. although it is unclear from the structural data alone, it seems possible that asp <dig> function may involve some aspect of divalent metal ion interaction. it will be intriguing to determine what contribution, if any, this highly conserved 'pore' region makes toward asp <dig> function. our phylogenetic analysis also shows that another actinobacteria-specific protein asp <dig>  which is a paralogue of asp <dig>  may also have similar structure and function. future genetic and biochemical studies of these proteins is therefore of great interest in linking the conservation of the biology of actinobacteria and their  <dig> unique genes.
