BACKGROUND
endogenous aldehyde molecules are intermediates/by-products of several fundamental metabolic pathways  <cit> , and are also produced in response to environmental stresses including salinity, dehydration, desiccation, cold, and heat shock  <cit> . although indispensable to biological processes, they are however toxic in excessive physiological concentrations  <cit> . the damaging effects of aldehydes and derivatives of aldehyde molecules, which include cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity, have been well studied in human, bacteria and fungi  <cit> . therefore, cellular levels of aldehydes must be regulated to ensure normal developmental growth processes.

aldehyde dehydrogenases  constitute a large family of nad+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the irreversible oxidation of a wide range of reactive aldehydes to their corresponding carboxylic acids  <cit> . in additions, aldhs have been shown to indirectly detoxify cellular ros and reduced the effect of lipid peroxidation mediated cellular toxicity under drought and salt stress  <cit> . aldhs are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. with the genome of more organisms being fully sequenced, the numbers of aldh genes identified have lately increased  <cit> . however, relatively few studies have been conducted on the corresponding plant enzymes and specifically on maize-aldhs.

the availability of recently sequenced maize genome  <cit>  has provided an avenue for gene discovery, functional and comparative genomics studies. this avails a basis for a close investigation into phylogenetic analysis and structural features of all maize aldhs compared to other well characterized plant aldhs. criteria for unified aldh nomenclature have been well established by the aldh gene nomenclature committee   <cit> . based upon these criteria, protein sequences with more than 40% identity to a previously identified aldh sequence represent a family, and sequences with more than 60% identity within the aldh family represent a protein subfamily  <cit> . we present here a revised and unified nomenclature for the maize aldh superfamily according to agnc criteria  <cit> .

some plants express mitochondrial genes that cause cytoplasmic male sterility , however, nuclear genes that disrupt the accumulation of the corresponding mitochondrial gene products can restore fertility to such plants. cms is a maternally inherited trait that is observed in more than  <dig> higher plant species including maize. the hybrid vigor in higher plants depends on the use of cms, which is characterized by the absence of functional pollen. cms is a useful system for commercial f <dig> hybrid breeding programs. in maize the male sterility is caused by a texas cytoplasm-specific mitochondrial gene , t-urf <dig> that encodes a  <dig> kda urf <dig> protein  <cit> . the dominant alleles for fertility restoration  rf <dig> and rf <dig>  have been shown to work together to restore the urf13-mediated sterility  <cit> . although many mitochondrial genes associated with cms have been characterized, the identification and characterization of rf genes has proven elusive, and only the maize rf2a, which encodes a mitochondrial aldh, aldh2b <dig>  is the most well characterized rf gene so far  <cit> . up to date, the mechanism by which urf <dig> causes male sterility in maize is not known, and the functional features of male sterility restorer, rf2a/aldh2b <dig>  is completely unknown. in addition, the maize line carrying texas male sterile cytoplasm is highly susceptible to southern corn leaf blight, one of the worst plant disease caused by cochliobolus heterostrophus race t, which produces a polyketide t-toxin, a determinant of the fungal virulence. using computational modeling, we have identified a novel tunnel like shape ligand binding cavity in the male sterility restorer, rf2a/aldh2b <dig> protein of maize. computational modeling is a powerful tool to predict protein structures, functions and protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. domain organization of proteins is an intrinsic element of protein structure and functionality. therefore, understanding the domain organizations of proteins is a prerequisite to efficiently manipulating and predicting the folding structure mediating functionality. the specific biochemical pathway of plant aldhs is an area of considerable interest. to better understand the roles of rf2a/aldh2b <dig>  we explore in detail the structural features of the maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel like cavity and discuss here it functional relevance compared to other members of maize aldh families.

RESULTS
the maize aldh gene superfamily: revised nomenclature and phylogenetic analysis
the release of maize genome sequence provides a powerful tool for identification and functional characterization of genes. here, we have searched the entire maize genome  <cit>  and assigned aldh nomenclature to identified maize genes based on sequence similarity of deduced amino acids to previously characterized aldh genes . to ensure the accuracy of the sequences used in the maize aldh gene superfamily identification, we used aldh conserved motifs, aldh active sites and aldh defined family criteria  and the arabidopsis aldh gene superfamily  <cit>  as database search queries. we verified all annotated maize aldh open reading frames  by comparing them to the cdna and est sequences. the search resulted in the identification of  <dig> unique aldh sequences encoding members of ten aldh protein families , two of which  have been previously identified  <cit> . compared to other well characterized plant aldhs, maize-aldh gene superfamily is the most expanded with  <dig> vs.  <dig> genes in rice  <cit> ;  <dig> genes in moss  <cit> ;  <dig> genes in algae  <cit> ; and  <dig> genes in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . five  out of the ten aldh families are represented by multiple aldh gene members , while the remaining five families  are represented by a single aldh gene copy . as expected, the phylogenetic analysis showed that z. mays aldh sequences are more closely related to oryza sativa  and a. thaliana, than to p. patens and c. reinhardtii aldhs , with adlh <dig> and aldh <dig> found only in p. patens and c. reinhardtii genome respectively, and c. reinhardtii lacking the aldh <dig> and aldh <dig> gene families . a phylogenetic analysis of maize aldh sequences with other putative plant aldhs revealed that plant aldhs are split into four clades and maize-aldhs share common core plant aldh families  .

presence  or absence  of aldh gene family is depicted in each indicated organism.

structural characterization of maize sterility restorer, rf2a, a member of class  <dig> aldhs
despite the important role of aldhs in plant sterility restoration, and environmental stress responses, only two reported crystal structures of aldh proteins from pisum sativum have been deposited in the protein data bank  database up to date. in order to understand the functional mechanism of aldh2b2/rf2a mediating male sterility restoration and other functions in maize, we analyzed in detail the conformational features of maize aldh2b <dig> using computational biology. we obtained the best predicted model of the maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig>  a mitochondrial associated protein, based on the ten best structural templates and the crystal structures of mitochondrial aldhs from different organisms deposited in the protein database . to better understand the boundary of the catalytic, the cofactor and the oligomerization domains of the protein, we colored coded the corresponding domains, and highlighted the predicted amino acids cys <dig> and glu <dig>  which drive the aldh reaction with the aldehyde substrate   <cit> . the quality of the modeled protein was estimated by the c-score values generated by i-tasser software, which reflects the coverage parameters in the structural simulations and the sequence alignment with the template. c-score is a confidence scoring function to assessing the quality of a prediction and estimate the accuracy of the i-tasser software predictions, which is based on the quality of the threading alignments and the convergence of i-tasser's structural assembly refinement simulations. typically, a good predicted model is obtained when the estimated level of confidence  is between - <dig> and  <dig>  the quality of the modeled protein as revealed by the c-score of  <dig>  and the percentage identity with the protein template  is good, because this value/level of confidence  ranges between - <dig> and  <dig>  which is the limit of the acceptable structural model prediction. the level of confidence for all our predicted maize aldh models were in the range of - <dig>  to  <dig>  , indicating that the protein structures were constructed with high accuracy. other parameters like tm-score and root mean square deviation  were used to check the topology and structural similarity of the models  <cit> . for aldh2b2/rf2a, both parameters were scored as  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> Å respectively. tm-score is used to assess the topological similarity of two protein structures, while rmsd is the measure of average distance between the backbones of superimposed proteins. the rmsd values of the predicted models and the templates although highly variable despite significant sequence similarity between them  are not unusual. they are indeed in the normal range of accepted rmsd values. these values however, can be drastically reduced if the modelled proteins are made from crystallized maize aldh structures. unfortunately, there is no single crystallized maize aldh protein up-to-date. the accepted models were then made from other organismal aldh templates as indicated in table  <dig>  the biological usefulness of the predicted protein models relies on the accuracy of the structural prediction. for example, high-resolution models with rmsd values in the range of 1- <dig> Å are typically generated by the crystallized model  using close homologous templates. medium-resolution models, roughly in the rmsd range of 3- <dig> Å are typically generated from distant homologous templates. even models with the lowest resolution but still with a correct topology predicted by either ab initio approaches or based on weak hits from threading, have a number of useful information including protein domain boundary identification, topology recognition and family/superfamily assignment.

the general structure of aldh2b2/rf2a shows the typical common strands and helices in the rossmann folding type depicted in different views . in order to study the specific domain structures, we examined the conservational residue pattern of the surface as well as the active pocket of the protein. the most variable surface residues  are on the periphery of aldh2b2/rf2a and the conserved residues  located in the core of the protein structures . generally, residues that are implicated in the biological processes such as protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions are solvent accessible, and residues implicated in protein structure and folding stability are located in the core of the protein. our findings revealed that maize aldh2b2/rf2a-coenzyme pocket is highly conserved, while the surface of the opposite side of the pocket is highly variable .

the structural comparison of maize aldh2b2/rf2a with other mitochondrial aldh orthologs allowed us to further validate the accuracy of the modeled maize aldh2b2/rf2a. we performed a structural superimposition of the maize aldh2b2/rf2a with crystallized mitochondrial aldh2b <dig> from different organisms . the structural protein superimposition , reveals very little structural deviations . however, the noticeable structural differences were located mainly in the tail of the n-term  domain . in addition, we observed small differences in some  <dig> d structural elements . in summary, the global topology was quite similar to the crystallized proteins, indicating that the modeled zmaldh2b2/rf2a reflects the crystal-like structure, and represents the most accurate structure of the protein ever reported .

we next explored and generated the electrostatic surface potentials of maize aldh2b2/rf2a. we examined the surface charge distribution in this protein using the adaptive poisson-boltzmann solver  package  <cit>  as shown in figure  <dig>  the depicted colors indicate the different surface properties, with red representing negative charge, blue positive and white neutral . to further present a detailed view of zmaldh2b2/rf2a surface properties, we showed the data in six surface plots/views, which correspond to rotations around the vertical  axis  and the horizontal  axis  . overall, the predominant electrostatic potential surface of zmaldh2b2/rf2a is negative  as indicated by the color coded pattern. however, positively charged amino acids were observed along the surface, and a visible positive region around the cofactor cleft region, and the interface between the coenzyme and catalytic domain are clearly observed .

sorting out zmaldh2b2/rf2a structural features
pocket/cavities mapping analysis of zmaldh2b2/rf2a revealed different interesting features . for the first time we provide here the anatomy of the catalytic clefts, the ligand-binding pockets and the structural tunnels of zmaldh2b2/rf2a. as shown in figure  <dig>  we detected various hidden specific pockets in zmaldh2b <dig>  the structural variability of these pockets reflects the multifunctionality features of zmaldh2b <dig>  the aldhs have been reported to have variable conformations between non-homologous proteins just like the ligand molecules, but it is also possible that the shapes of different protein binding pockets that bind the same ligand vary  <cit> . comparative residue analyses of conserved nadp+-dependent binding sites with those of well characterized/crystallized aldh structures are crucial for the prediction of cofactor specificity and enzymatic mechanism. in well characterized/crystallized aldhs, there is always a conserved glu residue  located on the opposite side of another conserved cys residue at the nad ring cavity formation. these residues are known to be implicated in proton abstraction from a cys residue during the aldh biochemical reaction. our computational modeling predicted that glu and cys residues were respectively positioned at  <dig> and  <dig> in the zmaldh2b2/rf2a primary protein sequence .

the rf2a protein has a broad substrate spectrum including aliphatic long chain and aromatic aldehydes  <cit> . mtaldhs typically have many potential substrates  <cit> . so far, the task of determining the specific aldehyde substrate of rf2a that must be oxidized during fertility restoration is particularly challenging. biochemical approaches to defining this substrate are complicated by the fact that mutants of the rf <dig> gene exert their effects on male fertility  in only a single internal cell layer of the anther . to overcome the limitation of biochemical and genetic approach and verify the ability of rf2a to oxidize a broad substrate spectrum including aliphatic long chain aldehydes, we here used computational biology to address this crucial question. we next sought to uncover some hidden structural features of zmaldh2b2/rf2a mediating other functions. to do so, we carried out a detailed anatomic analysis of the entire pockets/cavities -binding cavity). we here focused our attention on the geometry of ligand-binding sites to predict and unravel possible hidden ligand binding properties of zmaldh2b2/rf2a. we first hypothesized that if zmaldh2b2/rf2a mediating male sterility restoration is dependent on specific protein structural features, these features will only be found in zmaldh2b2/rf2a, owing to the fact that zmaldh2b2/rf2a is the only plant aldh known to play such function. interestingly, we found that zmaldh2b2/rf2a has a tunnel-like structure  made of two continuous cavities, which are big enough to hold various ligands and possibly allows other reactions than aldedehyde dehydrogenase activity. if this tunnel-like structure is critical for male sterility restoration, we expected this structure to be absent in other aldh protein families that lack this functions. to verify our hypothesis, we analyzed the volume and the interactive properties of the ligand binding regions of pockets/cavities from different members of rice and maize aldh superfamily . an average of  <dig> pockets were found in individual aldh structures analyzed across species . however, only zmaldh2b2/rf2a has a very spacious tunnel-like cavity as revealed by its large calculated volume  . in addition, we calculated/predicted and proposed possible ligands that could bind to the described cavities . our data revealed the uniqueness of the zmaldh2b2/rf2a tunnel characteristics. the amino acids sequence analysis  showed that the tunnel is predominantly composed of hydrophobic and neutral amino acids , with only 28% of charged amino acids. we postulate that together with its aldh activity, rf2a/zmaldh2b <dig> is the only maize aldh candidate that can hold a big molecule/ligand of hydrophobic characteristic in its unique and large tunnel. in summary we here provide direct structural evidence that zmaldh2b2/rf2a has a specific tunnel-like cavity not found in other aldhs, through which this protein could bind to various molecular ligands mediating other function.

functional relevance of rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel like cavity
the polyketide t-toxin produced by cochliobolus heterostrophus has been shown to bind the plant protein, urf <dig> causing the formation of pores in the inner membrane of mitochondria  <cit>  and leakage of nad+ along with other solutes hindering normal mitochondria function  <cit> . the interaction between urf <dig> and the polyketide from the fungus leads to southern corn leaf blight disease susceptibility. due to the spacious volume and the physic-chemical property of rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel like cavity, we hypothesized that it might be involved in long chain molecule and or polyketide t-toxin  sequestration. to test our hypothesis, we compared the physico-chemical properties of rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel like cavity with well characterized pkt binding sites in various organisms  <cit> . the structural models of various iterative pkt domains or sequence stretches that can potentially control the size and extent of unsaturated substrates were then analyzed. in addition, the cavity lining residues  and cavity volumes of the active pocket sites were analyzed. this allowed us to correlate the cavity volume and hydrophobicity of the active pocket sites to the number of iterations and the degree of unsaturation of the polyketide products they can hold . since t-toxin is a reducing pks having a greater proportion of saturated carbons  <cit> , we hypothesized that the physico-chemical property of the cavity sequesting t-toxin will be more hydrophobic in order to accommodate the higher proportion of saturated carbon chain of t-toxin molecule. indeed hydrophobicity cavity lining residues analysis revealed a higher degree of hydrophobicity of the amino acid residues integreting the rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tonnel-like cavity structure as expected . however, polyketides can contain several hydroxyl groups and some times unsaturated double bonds that required some levels of hydrophilic property to chemically fit into the cavity. consistant to this characteristic, we observed also distinct but relatively suttle region of hydrophilic property certainly required for the accomodation of the carbonyl groups of t-toxin molecule . it is known that smallest cavities  belong to the msas type pkss that perform three iterations  <cit> . intermediate sized cavities  belong to the napthopyrone  like pkss that iterate from five to eight times  <cit> . the largest cavities, 1780Å <dig>  were observed for the t-toxin models, which perform  <dig> iterations with the ligands  <cit> . as shown in figure 6b, the rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel like cavity falls into the large volume cavity group with its estimated volume of 1292Å <dig>  furthermore, the amino acid residue analysis  and the physical property of rf2a/aldh2b <dig> tunnel cavity correlate perfectly with the characteristic of t-toxin interactive pocket site, suggesting indeed that rf2a/ald2b <dig> might be able to bind/hold/sequester the t-toxin or any other toxic molecule as a ligand through its unique tunnel like cavity, by simply trapping the toxin into its big pocket/cavity. however, this interaction will still need to be supported experimentally.

discussion
cellular functions are carried out by  <dig> d well folded protein structures, protein-protein and potein-ligand interactions. given that nearly half of the fully sequenced maize genome is yet to be functionally annotated  <cit> , completion of this daunting task is paramount importance in order to elucidate the structural features of individual proteins to gain insights into their functional interaction network. in this study, we identified, annotated, and provided for the first time detailed structural features of selected members of maize aldh protein families. aldh proteins play essential roles in metabolic pathways that are critical for development and response to environmental changes  <cit> . using the phylogenetic analysis we uncovered the functional and evolutionary relationship of maize aldh protein superfamily with those of rice, arabidopsis, moss and algae. although the evolutionary relationships of aldhs have been the focus of extensive studies  <cit> , detailed functional characterization of maize aldh proteins has never been investigated. the maize genome database contains  <dig> genes encoding members of  <dig> aldh gene families , which are also represented in other angiosperm plants including rice, poplar and grape  <cit> . maize-aldh gene superfamily is the most expanded of plant aldhs ever characterized. a partial explanation for so many maize aldh genes is probably the need to provide aldh activity in various subcellular compartments. although some aldehydes  are able to move from one subcellular compartment to another, the molecular sizes of others preclude their passive diffusion across membranes. this probably justifies the presence of multiple organelle-specific aldhs identified not only in maize , but also in rice  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and other plant species  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that maize and rice aldhs split up into ten protein families , confirming that these two plant species are indeed monocots. when compared to other plant species, the evolutionary relationships could not be traced to the  <dig> protein family clades. instead, they are split into four major clades , revealing some interesting observations; aldh families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> seem to cluster together, suggesting that these families probably diverged from a common ancestor. finally, the predicted cytosolic and mitochondrial aldh forms in family  <dig> can be clearly separated from each other. this is in accordance with results of recently characterized aldh <dig> genes from arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

although the arabidopsis genome sequence has provided a major key for the identification of crucial genes in plants, the functions of grass-specific genes need to be elucidated to gain genetic control of biomass yield, environmental stress response, and quality in food crops  <cit> . using computational biology, we attempted in this paper to uncover for the first time some hidden structural features of maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig> gene product, a member of family  <dig> aldh proteins. class  <dig> maize aldh2b2/rf2a was the first plant aldh ever characterized  <cit> . rf2a encodes a nuclear restorer of cytoplasmic male sterility  <cit>  and functions in concert with rf <dig> to restore cms in maize. although rf <dig> proteins have been identified and characterized from various organisms, the mechanistic process of maize rf2a/aldh2b <dig> sterility restoration is unknown. the texas  cytoplasm male-sterile  maize had never attracted attention until the occurrence of southern corn leaf blight disease in  <dig>  <cit>  caused by a host selective toxin  produced by cochliobolus heterostrophus . t-cms maize is highly sensitive to t-toxin of c. heterostrophus  <cit> . in t-cms maize, the genomes of t cytoplasm mitochondria contain a single mitochondrial gene encoding for urf <dig> protein. urf <dig> accumulates in the inner membrane of the mitochondria  <cit>  causing t-cms maize to be sensitive to t-toxin. in addition, urf <dig> severely affects the tapetal cell layer of the anthers, which undergo a premature degeneration at the early microspore stage, resulting in pollen abortion  <cit> . genetic and kinetic studies of the maize mitochondrial aldhs reveal two rf <dig> proteins , and indicate that these two enzymes have similar, but non-identical substrates. the rf2a protein has a broad substrate spectrum including long-chain aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes, whereas rf2b can oxidize only short-chain aliphatic aldehydes  <cit> . interestingly, these two mitochondrial aldhs do not accumulate in the same tissues or at the same times  <cit> . it appears that plant mitochondrial aldhs have undergone functional specialization. this is confirmed by the observation of specific structural features that distinguish members of mitochondrial aldhs from each other . to better understand the functional specialization of mitochondrial maize aldhs, we analyzed in detail all the structural pockets/cavities of rf2a in comparison with various mitochondrial aldh proteins from other plant species. our data revealed distinct structural features of rf2a/aldh2b <dig> that might mediate novel ligand binding or other functional specialization. our structural analysis clearly displayed the uniqueness of the maize aldh2b2/rf2a tunnel cavity . this tunnel-like structure can hold up medium and long-chain aliphatic molecules that may be/are harmful to the mitochondria. amino acid sequence analysis of the cavity revealed that this tunnel is made of neutral and hydrophobic residues suitable for harboring big/long lipophilic and hydrophobic molecules such as the t-toxin , although this interaction needs to be experimentally tested.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified for the first time all members of the aldh protein superfamily in maize; provided a revised, unified nomenclature for these aldh proteins; analyze the molecular relationship among maize aldhs compared to other well characterized plant aldhs. our computational modeling analysis revealed a spacious tunnel like cavity in rf2a/aldh2b <dig>  a member of class  <dig> maize aldhs, never reported before through which this protein might functionally diverged from other mitochondrial plant aldhs. our data suggested that rf2a/aldh2b <dig> might interact with long aliphatic chain molecules and other harmful substrates/molecules through its tunnel like cavity to prevent their detrimental effects on mitochondrial organelles.
