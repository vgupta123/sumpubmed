BACKGROUND
irinotecan  is a topoisomerase i inhibitor and one of the main cytotoxic agent for treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal cancer  <cit> . in vivo, irinotecan is converted to 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin , by a carboxylesterase-mediated hydrolysis, a metabolite ~1000-fold more active as topoisomerase i inhibitor than irinotecan  <cit> . the elimination pathway of the active metabolite sn- <dig> is primarily through glucuronidation, which is mainly mediated by the udp-glucuronosyltransferase  1a <dig> enzyme  <cit> . low rates of sn- <dig> glucuronidation in tumor sites increase the level of the active compound that could lead to higher sensitivity to irinotecan. in contrast, high levels of ugt activity and expression were associated with an increase of sn- <dig> resistance in colon cancer cells  <cit> . therefore, the regulation of ugt1a gene expression together with other mechanisms altering its protein activity should be considered in tumor resistance to sn- <dig> 

epigenetic regulation is a key mechanism to either activate or silence gene transcription, and abnormal epigenetic regulation has been described as an important characteristic of tumor malignancy and progression  <cit> . furthermore, abnormal methylation of genes is a more common mechanism influencing gene activity than inheritable genetic mutations  <cit> , and might confer intrinsic drug resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment. more specifically, colorectal cancer  is commonly associated with an abnormal methylation of cpg rich site  in promoter region of multiple loci  <cit> . indeed, a subset of crc exhibit promoter methylation in multiple genes, referred to as the cpg island methylator phenotype  <cit> . hence, it is rational to propose that abnormal epigenetic regulation of sn-38-metabolizing genes would be a drug resistance mechanism.

we previously demonstrated aberrant methylation of specific cpg-rich regions in ugt1a1-negative cells , and such events result in complete repression of ugt1a <dig> transcriptional activity  <cit> . dna methylation may repress transcription by sterically hindering the binding of activating transcription factors  to their recognition sites  <cit> . similarly, treatment with dna methylation inhibitors enable binding of positive tfs and lead to gene reactivation  <cit> . in our previous report, treatment with demethylating and histone deacetylase inhibitor agents had the capacity to reverse aberrant hypermethylation and to restore ugt1a <dig> expression in hypermethylated ugt1a1-negative cells hct <dig>  but not in hypomethylated cells. loss of ugt1a <dig> methylation was further associated with an increase in ugt1a <dig> protein levels and with an enhanced sn- <dig> inactivation, by 300% in hct <dig> colon cancer cells  <cit> . in addition, human colon cancer cells has revealed that hypomethylation of the ugt1a <dig> 5'-flanking sequence  is important for ugt1a <dig> transcription. more specifically, the extent of ugt1a <dig> promoter methylation between cpg- <dig>  and - <dig>  of the promoter was shown to significantly predict ugt1a <dig> gene expression in colon cancer cell lines  <cit> . it is proposed that dna methylation would alter the binding affinity of some important positive tfs.

in this report, we identified tf that bind and influence transcriptional activity of ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter and determined whether methylation of cpg dinucleotides in this genomic region prevents binding of positive transcription factors.

RESULTS
usf1/ <dig> and hnf1-alpha bind the ugt1a <dig> gene promoter and activate transcription
by using a computer-based approach , several putative tf binding sites were observed in ugt1a <dig> 5'-flanking sequence , namely nf-y , hnf1-alpha , cdx <dig> , usf  and oct <dig>  binding sites encompassing cpg- <dig> to - <dig> . among those tfs, hnf1-alpha, cdx <dig> and oct <dig> have previously been shown to interact with some ugt1a isoforms  <cit> , but the interaction with ugt1a <dig> was only demonstrated for hnf1-alpha  <cit> . interestingly, the cpg- <dig> is included in the usf recognition core sequence, the cpg- <dig> is part of the nf-y/pbx binding site, and the hnf <dig> response element  is found between cpg- <dig> and - <dig> 

to address whether nf-y, hnf1-alpha, cdx <dig>  usf1/ <dig>  and oct <dig> might specifically bind to the proximal promoter of ugt1a <dig>  electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed using nuclear protein extracts from ht <dig> cells, and synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides derived from the ugt1a <dig> promoter sequence and containing each putative tf binding site . dna-protein complexes are formed with all transcription factor-associated oligonucleotide probes, except for cdx <dig> and pbx . each specific dna-protein complex was competed by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of either the consensus recognition sequence or the unlabeled probe, thus providing evidence for specific binding. to further support the identity of dna-binding proteins, we performed binding assays in presence of specific antibodies. the addition of mouse monoclonal anti-usf <dig> and anti-usf <dig> led to the formation of a supershifted dna-protein complex  with the usf response element -containing probe, likely indicating that both usf <dig> and usf <dig> might bind to ugt1a <dig> promoter. similar results were observed with the specific anti-hnf1-alpha and nf-y antibodies, whereas the presence of anti-oct <dig> antibody did not affect the formation of dna-protein complex iii with the oct1-specific probe. the later likely indicates that an unknown dna-binding protein might interact with this ugt1a <dig> promoter sequence.

to investigate the functional importance of these dna-protein interactions, namely with usf1/ <dig>  hnf1-alpha, nf-y, and oct <dig>  upon ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter activity, we disrupted either of their predicted recognition sequences in a  <dig> bp fragment of the human ugt1a <dig> gene promoter . these constructions were introduced into the pgl3-luciferase reporter plasmid and transfected in ugt1a1-expressing ht <dig> cells. ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter activity was significantly attenuated by disruption of hre and ure . in contrast, mutations in the nf-y and oct <dig> binding motifs had no effect on transcriptional activity. the result for oct <dig> is in accordance with previous emsa experiments. accordingly, these results established that hre and ure would play a role in positive regulation of the ugt1a <dig> gene expression.

cpg methylation at the usf response element inhibits the formation of specific dna-protein complex
as described above, the cpg- <dig> is part of the usf recognition core sequence. therefore, we may expect that cytosine methylation at this site would hinder specific tf interaction. on the other hand, the hre is found between cpg- <dig> and - <dig> dinucleotides and should intuitively not be affected by cpg-related dna methylation. to investigate this, we firstly performed emsas using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe including the ure. the oligonucleotide has been either methylated or not at the cpg- <dig> dinucleotide . incubation of in vitro translated usf <dig> proteins with either methylated or unmethylated 32p-labeled probe resulted in the formation of specific dna-protein complexes . this indicates that 5-methylcytosine did not totally prevent the usf <dig> protein binding. however, the protein binding to unmethylated probe is less competed by 100-fold excess of methylated oligonucleotide than the unmethylated one, whereas binding to methylated probe is equally competed by either methylated or unmethylated cold oligonucleotide. it suggests that usf <dig> may interact with methylated dna but have higher affinity for its unmethylated binding motif. the incubation of usf <dig> protein with either anti-usf <dig> or anti-usf <dig> antibody well demonstrated that usf <dig> specifically bind this ugt1a <dig> promoter sequence. the absence of supershifted complex with anti-usf <dig> antibody denotes that antibody-induced supershifted complex is not caused by a non-specific interaction with the antibody.

in a second emsa experiment, we examined the interaction between usf1/ <dig> and hnf1-alpha  with ugt1a <dig> promoter sequence including both tf binding sites. we used solely unmethylated oligonucleotide as probe, but either unmethylated or methylated oligonucleotide as cold competitor . we observed the formation of two specific and one unspecific dna-protein complexes. by specific competition with hre or ure-containing oligonucleotide, we determined that dna-protein complex i and ii are formed by hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig>  respectively. we noted that solely the specific complex i is equally competed by excess of both methylated and unmethylated cold competitor. in contrast the complex ii, formed by usf1/ <dig>  is more competed by molar excess of unmethylated cold competitor. the unspecific dna-protein complex is not competed by either competitor. the positive correlation between the unspecific complex intensity and the increase amount of competitor indicates a rise in probe availability for nonspecific dna-binding proteins. in summary, this experiment further demonstrated that cpg methylation impairs dna-binding for usf1/ <dig> but not for hnf1-alpha, likely because its recognition site remains unaffected by cpg methylation in our experiment context.

upregulation of hnf1a gene expression is observed following treatment with the 5-aza-dc demethylating agent in ugt1a1-negative cells
we presented that cpg methylation might affect ugt1a <dig> gene expression through alteration of cis-acting elements. however, evidence supports that dna methylation-induced gene silencing is also caused by inhibition of trans-acting factor gene expression. we previously demonstrated that the ugt1a1-negative cell line hct <dig> is able to express ugt1a <dig> following 5-aza-dc treatment  <cit> . we showed that such a gene induction is due, at least in part, by the demethylation of ugt1a <dig> promoter. considering the importance of hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig> in ugt1a <dig> gene expression and also that hct <dig> cell line is known to be hnf1-negative, we sought to determine whether the usf <dig> and usf <dig> gene expression is influenced by the cell methylation status and whether hnf1a gene expression is restored in 5-aza-dc-treated hct <dig> hypermethylated cells. as expected, the presence of hnf1a mrna was undetectable by reverse pcr in untreated hct <dig> cells. however, the 5-aza-dc treatment induced the hnf1a gene expression . these data support that hnf1a is also modulated in these cells by methylation, as observed for ugt1a <dig>  in fact, three regions in hnf1a -5kb promoter were predicted as cpg islands by the cpgplot program  . on the other hand, we did not get any observable variation in both usf <dig> and usf <dig> gene expression following treatment with 5-aza-dc in both cell lines.

discussion
in this report, we predicted several putative tf binding sites in ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter using a bioinformatic tool and demonstrated by emsa that hnf1-alpha, usf1/ <dig>  and nf-y would bind to ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter. the influence of these tfs upon ugt1a <dig> transcriptional activity was then demonstrated by transient transfection in colon adenocarcinoma cell line ht <dig>  and solely hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig> have been shown to have significant impact.

mutations in the hnf1-alpha motif resulted in a substantial reduction of ugt1a <dig> promoter activity in ht <dig> cells. this hre located in the human ugt1a <dig> promoter consists of a very well conserved half-site and a more divergent one with respect to the consensus sequence, which is very similar to the one from mouse ugt1a <dig> promoter and rat albumin promoter  <cit> . consistent with previous studies in mice, hnf1-alpha proteins failed to bind  and trans-activate the human ugt1a <dig> promoter when the conserved half-site is altered . besides, our data indicate that the one half of the hre palindromic sequence is sufficient for its recognition of the ugt1a <dig> promoter, and that hnf1-alpha is critical for ugt1a <dig> expression.

hnf1-alpha is well-known to be involved in regulation of several ugts, including human ugt2b <dig>  ugt2b <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig>  ugt1a <dig> and rat ugt1a <dig>  <cit> . although the role of hnf1-alpha in the regulation of ugt1a <dig> has already been studied  <cit> , the data were limited to transient transfections of the -617/+ <dig> ugt1a <dig> promoter and its hnf1-deleted construct into ugt1a1-negative hek <dig> kidney cells. in here, we emphasized the importance of hnf1-alpha in the regulation of ugt1a <dig>  and in contrast to previous observations, data were demonstrated in cells with a known glucuronidation capacity.

as observed for hnf1-alpha, mutations in ure also resulted in a drastic reduction of the promoter activity in ht <dig> cells, supporting for the first time, a role for this tf in the regulation of ugt1a <dig> promoter. upstream stimulatory factors, usf <dig> and  <dig> are late tfs able to interact as homo- and/or heterodimers on e boxes of cacgtg sequence  <cit> . usfs are ubiquitously expressed proteins that have been described as positive or negative regulators of numerous genes, including cyclin-cdk encoding genes, tumour suppressor genes, and growth factor networks  <cit> . to our knowledge, no interaction of usf <dig> or usf <dig> with phase ii enzymes such as the ugt family members has been documented thus far.

while emsa indicated that nf-y might also bind ugt1a <dig> promoter, mutations in its binding motif did not significantly reduce the luciferase activity compared with the wild-type construct in ht <dig> cells, suggesting that basal promoter activity does not require direct interaction of this tf. although informative, promoter-reporter constructs inadequately mimic the chromosomal context. it is now appreciated that chromatin-associated factors are various key determinants for specific gene expression  <cit> . accordingly, we may not rule out that nf-y would contribute to ugt1a <dig> gene expression in native cells.

the observation that ure includes a cpg dinucleotide contact point, which is critical for recognition by the usf proteins, prompted us to hypothesize that a usf e-box element that contained 5-methylcytosine in the cacgtg core might affect the binding for usf1/ <dig>  emsa using unmethylated probe resulted in the formation of an usf-ugt1a <dig> complex. when methylated, ure-containing oligonucleotide competed poorly for usf1/ <dig> binding, showing that specific methylation of cpg- <dig> dinucleotide decrease the affinity for usf1/ <dig>  it was previously shown that methylation at the cpg site, centrally located in the e-box motif , strongly inhibits formation of dna-protein complex  <cit>  and negatively regulates gene expression. single nucleotide polymorphisms, within the e-box core motif, also modulate gene regulation. notably, a single g/c base transition within the usf e-box consensus of the thymidylate synthase gene, implicated in folate metabolism, prevents usf proteins from binding to their cognate sequence  <cit> .

as we observed previously for ugt1a <dig>  <cit> , data indicate that dna methylation is one mechanism likely involved in the down-regulation of hnf1a gene expression in colon cells. dna methyltransferase inhibitor treatment of ugt1a1-negative hct <dig> colon cells restored hnf1a gene expression. 5-aza-dc-induced gene reactivation has two distinct requirements: 1) the reversal of promoter dna hypermethylation, and 2) the presence of transcriptional activators competent for activation of the target promoter. considering that hnf1-alpha is essential for ugt1a <dig> gene expression, the methylation of hnf1a gene promoter represents a second level of dna methylation-mediated regulation, which highlights the complexity of epigenetic gene regulation. the modulation of hnf1a expression might also have impact on the regulation of other genes, notably on additional phase ii enzymes including other ugts  <cit> , glutathione transferase  <cit> , and sulfotransferase  <cit> .

interestingly, the ugt1a1-associated hre, which is free of cpg dinucleotide, is located between cpg- <dig> and - <dig>  and we demonstrated that methylation of proximal cpg dinucleotides is not sufficient to significantly alter hnf1-alpha binding in vitro. however, we may not rule out the importance of dna methylation in the binding of hnf1-alpha in vivo, because such a dna modification induces a repressive chromatin structure, and might restrain the accessibility of hnf1-alpha to its recognition sequence in ugt1a <dig> promoter. however, we suggest that ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter methylation may directly affect transcriptional activity by suppressing the interaction of usf1/ <dig> with its cognate sequence.

taken together, our results reveal that both hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig> could play an important role in activating the transcription from ugt1a <dig> promoter. the interplay between hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig> has been previously shown to be implicated in the liver-specific expression of the pyruvate kinase gene, in the regulation of three human class i alcohol dehydrogenase genes and in the constitutive expression of cyp1a <dig>  <cit> . considering that ugt1a1-mediated glucuronidation is the primary route of irinotecan inactivation, it was suggested that the level of ugt1a <dig> expression might contribute to the differential chemosensitivity of colon tumors  <cit> . in a previous report, we showed that methylation of ugt1a <dig> promoter may conduct to reduction of gene expression level, leading to a lower ugt1a <dig> glucuronidation activity. accordingly, positive ugt1a <dig> methylation in tumors, and subsequent repression of ugt1a1-associated metabolic pathways would be involved in retention of active sn- <dig> within colon cancer cells. this could lead to higher sensitivity to irinotecan. in contrast, the presence of high levels of ugt activity and expression was identified as a characteristic associated with a resistance phenotype to sn- <dig> in colon cancer cells, as supported by a previous report  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reveals that basal ugt1a <dig> expression in colon cells is positively regulated by sequence-specific binding of hnf1-alpha and usf1/ <dig>  and negatively regulated by dna methylation of cpg- <dig> located in the proximal ugt1a <dig> promoter. this suggests that cpg- <dig> methylation status might be a relevant indicator of ugt1a <dig> proximal promoter methylation and by consequence a potential epigenetic marker of ugt1a <dig> gene expression. besides, epigenetic regulation of hnf1a gene could also play an important role in regulating additional cellular drug metabolism and transporter pathways. altogether, the epigenetic regulation of hnf1a and ugt1a <dig> genes may contribute to determine local inactivation of drugs, such as the anticancer agent sn- <dig> by glucuronidation and define tumoral response to irinotecan. further studies are required to examine this hypothesis.
