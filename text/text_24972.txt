BACKGROUND
ad is the most prominent dementia in senile population affecting approximately 5% of the over 65-year old populations, but the cause of ad remains largely unknown. in the pathogenesis of ad, the inflammation mechanism is seemed to play an important role  <cit> . the senile plaque is the hallmark of ad. the core of the senile plaque is the deposition of β-amyloid  and the activated microglia and astroglia are around the senile plaque. in these glias, numerous inflammation factors including il-1β, interleukin - <dig>  tumor necrosis factor-α  and inos etc, are overexpressed. these inflammation factors have been seemed to be neurotoxic. at the same time, some epidemiological studies demonstrated that long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  could prominently delay the onset of ad  <cit> . the current drugs for ad treatment including cholinesterase inhibitors  and n-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor antagonist  which were approved by food and drug administration of usa  are symptomatic treatment, but these drugs usually can not delay the development of ad. anti-inflammation drugs are expected to delay ad, but most clinical research results of nsaids on ad are negative  <cit> . moreover some selective cox- <dig> inhibitors increased the occurrence of cardiovascular accidents  <cit> .

berberine is an isoquinoline alkaloid with a long history of medicinal usage in china. it exists in hydrastis canadensis , cortex phellodendri  and rhizoma coptidis . these medicinal plants have been widely used as traditional medicines for treating diarrhea and gastrointestinal disorders for a long time in china. berberine, the major ingredient of these herbs, has multiple pharmacological effects. it is a acetylcholinesterase inhibitor similar to galanthamine <cit> , a drug treating ad, and might be a low-molecular-weight neurotrophic drug to neurodegeneration disorder such as ad by potentiating the nerve growth factor -induced differentiation in neural cells  <cit> ; berberine is a novel cholesterol-lowering drug distinctly from statins by stabilizating the low density lipoprotein receptor  mrna to increase ldlr expression and inhibiting lipid synthesis <cit> . berberine is also able to exert a glucose-lowering effect by insulin independent manner  <cit> , stimulating insulin secretion and effectively sensitizing insulin activity  <cit> . so berberine can play an important role on metabolic syndrome. berberine could improve quality of life and decrease ventricular premature complexes and mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure  <cit> . berberine has potential in the prevention of atherosclerosis and restenosis  <cit> . berberine can block transient outward potassium current  and delayed rectifier potassium current  in a concentration-dependent manner in acutely isolated ca <dig> pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus  <cit> . a recent study demonstrated that mutations in voltage-gated potassium channel kcnc <dig> caused adult-onset ataxia  <cit> , and potassium channels are regarded to play a key role in neurodegeneration including ad  <cit> . so berberine might be useful for the treatment of neurodegeneration disorders including ad.

except the above pharmacological effects, extracts obtained from the roots of berberidaceae species have been used in eastern and bulgarian folk medicines for the treatment of rheumatic and other chronic inflammatory disorders. berberine suppressed a delayed type hypersensitivity  reaction in a chronic inflammatory model of adjuvant arthritis and diminished the antibody response against sensitization red blood cell  in vitro  <cit> . in recent years, it was demonstrated that berberine could inhibit the expression of some inflammation factors. it might inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism in rabbit platelets and endothelial cells  <cit> . berberine could decrease cyclooxygenase- <dig>  expression by directly inhibiting the activator protein- <dig> binding and il-1β and tnf-α productions in hepg <dig> cells and cardiomyocyte through nuclear factor-κb  signaling pathway  <cit> . it could decrease il- <dig> production in esophageal cancer cells and inhibit expression of inos mrna in ethanol-induced gastric ulcer mice  <cit> .

so berberine might be a very promising drug to treat the cardiac disease, stroke, diabetes and hyperlipoidemia and chronic inflammation diseases. so far, whether berberine might be beneficial to ad by decreasing the inflammation factors expression has not been studied. to test the hypothesis that berberine might inhibit the inflammation factors il-1β and inos expression in the rat model of ad, we used the rat model of ad established by injecting aβ into the bilateral hippocampuses with stereotaxic coordinates and gave the rats berberine chloride  intragastricly for  <dig> days. it was very surprising that we found berberine chloride could significantly ameliorate the spatial memory impairment and increase these two factors expression.

RESULTS
effects of berberine chloride on the impairment of spatial memory
rats were trained in the water maze for  <dig> days starting at the eighth day after the injection of aβ . rats were more efficient at finding the platform on successive trails . the main effect for each day was significant . the main effect of berberine chloride was also significant . two-way repeated measure analysis of variance  revealed a significant increase in escape latency to find the platform in the aβ-injected group as compared with the normal group  and a significant decrease in escape latency when berberine chloride  was intragasticly administrated as compared with the aβ -injected group.

in the retention test , the number of crossings over a platform position was significantly decreased in the aβ-injected group as compared with that in the normal group . the crossing number was recovered by treatment with berberine chloride and the recovery was significant . all rats showed normal swimming performance and constant increases in body weight. locomotor activity did not show difference among groups.

immunohistochemical evaluation of the effects of berberine chloride on the expression of il-1β and inos
the effects of berberine chloride on the expression of il-1β and inos were investigated after the berberine chloride treatment  for  <dig> days by immunohistochemistry. the injection of aβ in the hippocampus highly induced the increase of il-1β and inos immunostainings , which were more significantly increased in the berberine chloride-treated rats . the number of il-1β-positive cells increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>   group) and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   + berberine group) , and the number of inos-positive cells also increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>   to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  group) and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   + berberine group) .

evaluation of the effects of berberine chloride on the mrna of il-1β and inos by real time pcr
the effects of berberine chloride on the mrna of il-1β and inos were investigated after berberine chloride  treatment for  <dig> days by real time pcr. injection of aβ  in the hippocampus highly increase the mrna of il-1β and inos , which were even more significantly increased in the berberine chloride-treated rats . the relative copies of il-1β mrna on internal control β-actin  in the aβ group and aβ + berberine group were increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively , and the relative copies of inos mrna on internal control β-actin  in the above two groups were increased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively .

discussion
in this study, we observed that berberine chloride  could significantly decrease the escape latency and increase the number of crossings over the platform position in the rats model of ad assayed by morris water maze test, and could also increase both il-1β and inos expression very significantly assayed by immunohistochemical method. these results are not coincide with the previous studies that berberine could inhibit the expression of inos and il-1β  <cit> . the difference between our results and those of previous studies might be due to the different administration mode of berberine and the effect that berberine can increase non-specific immunity. berberine was intraperitoneally administrated or used in cells culture model in the reported studies in contrast to the intragastric administration in the present experiment. the uptake rate of berberine by intragastric administration is very low  <cit> . so the concentration of berberine in blood or cell culture medium in the reported studies is higher than the level in the present investigation. the different level of berberine may cause different effects on the immunity and inflammation factors' expression.

berberine has been used by oral administration as an unprescribed drug in china, and the safety and efficacy of berberine by this administration mode have been generally accepted. moreover, berberine  by intragastric administration can significantly exert cholesterol-lowering effect on rats  <cit> . so in this study, we chosed the dose  <dig> mg/kg to study berberine's effect on the expression of il-1β and inos because this dose and administration mode are more close to the clinical practice than veno-injection or intraperitoneal administration. we presume that the increase of inflammation factors il-1β and inos might be related to the rising of microglia activation. in another two previous studies, berberine was demonstrated to be able to activate macrophages and increase the phagcytosing function of peritoneal macrophages  and the production of il- <dig> by pmΦ in mice  <cit> . it is indicated that berberine is a potent macrophage activator and can increase non-specific immunity. moreover it was demonstrated that berberine could decrease the expression of pparγ <dig> mrna and protein which was a negative regulator of inflammation <cit> . microglia and pmΦ are originated from the peripheric mononuclear macrophage. so berberine might be able to activate the microglia to phagocytize the exogenous aβ which was injected into hippocampus. in another our study, we had also demonstrated that berberine was able to increase the microglia activation and significantly decrease the expression pparγ after the injection of aβ into the hippocampus . so in this study, berberine should be able to increase the inflammation factors expression including il-1β and inos by increasing microglia activation.

it seems that berberine might not be beneficial to ad because it can increase the inflammation factors' expression and microglia activation. but inflammation factors might also be beneficial to central nervous system . it was reported that il-1β might be crucial to the repair of the cns presumably through the induction of astrocyte and microglia-macrophage-derived insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  and il-1β--/- mice failed to remyelinate properly which was correlated to the lack of igf- <dig> production by microglia-macrophages and astrocytes and to a profound delay of precursors differentiating into mature oligodendrocytes  <cit> . so berberine might ameliorate the pathologies of ad through increasing the expression of il-1β. at the same time, a very recent study demonstrated that genetic removal of inos in mice expressing mutated amyloid precursor protein resulted in pathological hyperphosphorylation of mouse tau, its redistribution to the somatodendritic compartment in cortical and hippocampal neurons, and aggregate formation. lack of inos in the amyloid precursor protein swedish mutant mouse would increase the insoluble aβ levels, neuronal degeneration, caspase- <dig> activation and tau cleavage. this phenomenon suggested that nitric oxide  acted as a junction point between aβ, caspase activation, and tau aggregation, and inos deletion could promote multiple pathologies in a mouse model of ad  <cit> . so berberine might be able to ameliorate the multiple pathologies of ad by increasing inos expression. moreover, berberine might be beneficial to the senile plaque clearance by increasing microglia activation. a recent study demonstrated that bone marrow-derived microglia played a critical role in restricting senile plaque formation in ad, and therapeutic strategies aiming to improve bone marrow-derived microglia recruitment could potentially lead to a new powerful tool for the elimination of toxic senile plaques  <cit> . another recent study also demonstrated that suppressing microglia activation and reducing inflammation factors expression by minocycline could enhance senile plaque formation  <cit> . moreover ad might be associated with the aging of microglia for postnatal microglia, non-adult microglia has the ability to phagocytose aβ fibrils <cit> . the above studies indicated that anti-inflammation drugs might not be beneficial to ad, which is consistent with the vague effect of this kind of drugs including nsaids on ad. so berberine might be beneficial to ad by enhancing the bone barrow derived mononuclear macrophage to cross the blood-brain barrier  and to be activated microglia which has the ability to phagocytose aβ fibrils, clear the senile plaque and produce the more inflammation factors.

CONCLUSIONS
berberine might be beneficial to ad by ameliorating spatial memory impairment, improving inflammation factors expression, activating microglia and the senile plaque clearance. but further investigation is needed in ad transgenic models and clinical research to demonstrate the efficacy of berberine to ad.
