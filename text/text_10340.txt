BACKGROUND
hemoglobin plays a critical role in both terrestrial and aquatic animals by transporting oxygen from the respiratory surface to the inner organs. the functional complexity and evolutionary adaptation of this heme-containing molecule to different environments has therefore attracted researchers for more than a half-century. in jawed vertebrates, or gnathostomes, the hemoglobin tetramer consists of two pairs of α- and β-globins, which probably arose by duplication of a single primordial globin gene about 500- <dig> million years ago   <cit> . whereas α- and β-globin genes are juxtaposed in teleost fish, birds and mammals are characterized by unlinked clusters of α- and β-globin genes, which in mammals are arranged in the order of their expression during ontogeny  <cit> . based on the conservation of the globin-flanking genes, including mpg and c16orf <dig>  all gnathostomes examined share a common globin cluster referred to as the mc locus  <cit>  corresponding to the α-globin cluster in placental mammals and chicken. silencing of the β genes in the ancestral mc-α-β cluster has apparently also occurred in non-amniotic species, such as pufferfish, whereas a single β-like ϖ-globin is retained in the α cluster of marsupials and monotremes  <cit> . the teleost-specific genome duplication event 350- <dig> mya probably gave rise to the second fish α-β globin cluster flanked by arhgap <dig>  lcmt and aqp <dig>  <cit> . it should be noted that this la locus lacks globin genes in tetrapods, but is positioned on the α-containing chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> in man and chicken, respectively  <cit> . the amniotic β-globin cluster is thought to have originated from the transposition of a β gene copy into a region of olfactory receptor genes in their ancestor  <cit> .

in contrast to the linked α-β globin pairs identified in xenopus, the fish α-β pairs are commonly organized head-to-head or tail-to-tail with respect to transcriptional polarity  <cit> . these configurations probably arose from an inversion of one of the paired α-β genes in an ancestral ray-finned fish, thus resembling the reported case of gene inversion within the human β-globin cluster  <cit> . the structural and functional diversity of the multiple hemoglobins in teleosts strongly indicates that they have experienced a major evolutionary pressure to execute their oxygen-transporting function under highly variable physico-chemical conditions  <cit> . the selective forces have apparently resulted in the loss of hemoglobin genes in the white-blooded antarctic icefishes  to reduce the blood viscosity at stable subzero temperatures  <cit> .

the genomic organization of the fish α-β globin clusters has only been investigated in the model species pufferfish, zebrafish and medaka  <cit> . atlantic cod is a marine cold water species being widely distributed from the sea surface to depths of  <dig> m in the arctic and temperate regions of the north atlantic ocean, including the low saline baltic sea. adaptation of the different cod populations to the varying physico-chemical conditions seems to involve hemoglobins with highly ph-sensitive oxygen affinities  to adjust the swimming bladder to variable pressure during vertical migrations  <cit> , together with the novel feature of expressing polymorphic variants with different oxygen-binding properties  <cit> . a variable number of cod hemoglobin genes and allelic variants have been reported in norwegian, icelandic and canadian populations  <cit> . here, we screened the draft cod genome  <cit>  and identified nine α- and β-globin genes, which are organized in two unlinked clusters flanked by highly conserved syntenic regions. we document close linkage between the conserved globin-flanking genes in extant cephalochordate and urochordate species, and hypothesize that the fusion of three chordate chromosomes formed the ancestral vertebrate globin cluster more than  <dig> mya.

RESULTS
identification of cod globin clusters
pcr primers were designed and employed to identify α-β-linked globin genes from genomic dna, but this strategy resulted only in the amplification of the head-to-head organized α1-β <dig> pair . we therefore screened an atlantic cod bacterial artificial chromosome  library for α- and β-globin genes. pyrosequencing of two positive bac clones respectively resulted in  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads, which were assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig> contigs . multiple hemoglobin genes and conserved globin-flanking genes were identified by performing blast searches of the contigs using the pufferfish globin loci as query sequences. finally, the most updated draft sequences from the cod genome project  were screened to confirm the gene sequences identified in the bac clones, and the genomic organization of the hemoglobin loci was determined. the presented sequence information therefore represents the north-east arctic population of atlantic cod.

cod mc locus
four hemoglobin genes designated β <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and α <dig> were identified within a 7-kb region of a scaffold spanning  <dig>  mb in the draft cod genome . the hemoglobin genes show the characteristic structure of three exons and two introns encoding the predicted α- and β-globins of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids , respectively . the paired α-β genes are organized tail-to-tail , head-to-head  or tail-to-head , and the α <dig> gene is transcribed in the opposite direction of the others. seven conserved genes, c16orf <dig>  polr3k, mgrn <dig>  aanat, rhbdf <dig>  mpg and c16orf <dig>  were identified within a  <dig> kb region leftwards of the β5-α1-β1-α <dig> cluster, while the rightwards flanking region of  <dig> kb harbors ankrd <dig>  dock <dig> and huc . a single major regulatory element  was identified as a reversed motif  in intron  <dig> of rhbdf <dig> close to a putative gata binding site. whereas paired mres are located at this position in other vertebrates examined, a second single mre motif was found in intron  <dig> of the cod mgrn <dig> gene. in zebrafish, two additional mgrn <dig> genes  are also linked to the la globin locus.

cod la locus
the second cod globin cluster was shown to contain five hemoglobin genes in the order β3-β4-α2-α3-β <dig> positioned within a region of about  <dig> kb in a scaffold spanning  <dig> kb . the tail-to-head organized pairs β4-α <dig> and α3-β <dig> are transcribed in opposite directions. the three exons encode the 147-aa long β-globins, while the predicted α <dig> contains only  <dig> aa compared to the other α-globins of  <dig> aa . the globin cluster is flanked on the leftward side by a 70-kb region harboring duplicated aqp <dig> genes similar to the zebrafish locus, and the adjacent arhgap <dig> and lcmt genes are conserved in the teleosts examined . a rhbdf1-like gene is juxtaposed to foxj <dig> in the la locus of only cod and pufferfish, whereas we found a foxj <dig> gene coupled to the mc locus in stickleback  and zebrafish . we also identified paralogs of stickleback rhbdf <dig> , arhgap <dig>  and foxj <dig>  linked on chromosome  <dig>  which, however, contains no globin genes, whereas an arhgap <dig> duplicate is coupled to the mc locus in pufferfish , zebrafish  and medaka . a second arhgap <dig> gene was also identified in the cod genome, but we presently lack information about any linkage to the globin loci.

other cod globin genes
five additional globin genes encoding myoglobin, neuroglobin, globin-x and two cytoglobins were identified in the cod genome . the gene encoding the predicted cod myoglobin of  <dig> aa is organized as the α-β globins, while neuroglobin and globin-x of  <dig> and  <dig> aa, respectively, are encoded by four and five exons. the three exons of the cytoglobin- <dig> gene encode a protein of  <dig> aa, while the draft genome sequences contained only a partial cytoglobin- <dig> gene. the four α-globins are less similar  than the five β-globins  of which β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> show high sequence identity. the α-globins share only 25-33% identity with the β-globins, compared to sequence identities of about 20% between the cod α-β globins and the other globins, except for the very low similarity with globin-x. despite this low overall identity, highly conserved positions were identified throughout the aligned sequences, including human β-globin . rare mutations in almost all these positions have been reported to affect the functionality of human hemoglobin  <cit> , and suggest the importance of these residues for the proper structure and/or function of different oxygen-binding molecules in diverse vertebrate species.

globin gene mapping and expression
the cod α-β globin clusters were mapped to different linkage groups by genotyping multiple single nucleotide polymorphic  markers, including the globin snps underlying the metβ1val and thrα2ile polymorphisms  <cit> . the segregation of the snps in full-sib cod families localized the mc and la loci to linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, among the total of  <dig> linkage groups  <cit> .

the nine α-β globin genes were shown to be transcriptionally active by quantifying the mrna levels throughout the life cycle of atlantic cod using real-time qpcr . intriguingly, α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> mrnas were identified in unfertilized eggs, whereas fertilized eggs and early embryos contained mainly the β <dig> transcript. the later stages of embryogenesis showed very low hemoglobin mrna levels prior to the larval expression of several α- and β-globin genes, and all hemoglobin genes were expressed in the juvenile and adult fish. abundant expression of α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> was measured in the adult fish, while the other genes showed low mrna levels .

discussion
the atlantic cod genome was shown to harbor altogether nine α- and β-globin genes organized in two unlinked clusters similar to the other teleost genomes available. the expression of many hemoglobin genes in adult cod is consistent with the multiple tetrameric hemoglobin types and subtypes identified by gel electrophoresis of blood proteins  <cit> . the cod hemoglobin repertoire is further extended by the polymorphic α <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> globins  <cit>  of which the functionally different variants of β <dig> are differentially distributed in cod populations  <cit> . the dominant expression of α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> in adult fish is in agreement with the isolation of three major tetramers designated hb <dig>  hb <dig> and hb <dig>  which comprise different combinations of these four subunits  <cit> . the tetrameric hb <dig>  was shown to exhibit a marked root effect of importance for the delivery of oxygen to the swim bladder for neutral buoyancy and to the retina for enhanced visual acuity via the highly specialized vascular structures  <cit> . the structural basis for this extreme acid-induced reduction in oxygen affinity is far from understood, but the putative key residues, including asp95α, asp99β and asp101β  <cit> , are conserved in the cod hemoglobins, except for β <dig> and α <dig>  we therefore suggest that the β1-containing hb <dig> tetramer  has no root effect and might function as an emergency oxygen supplier when fish exercise vigorously.

the detection of hemoglobin mrnas in unfertilized cod eggs is the first evidence of maternally inherited α-β globins, while vlecken et al.  <cit>  recently reported maternal transfer of myoglobin mrna in zebrafish. the function of these oxygen-binding molecules in the early fish embryo is uncertain, as aerobic processes have been shown to continue in the zebrafish embryo after functional ablation of hemoglobin  <cit> . hemoglobin-derived antimicrobial peptides expressed in the fish epithelium have been suggested to play a significant role in the non-specific immune response  <cit> , together with maternally transferred transcripts encoding lysozyme and cathelicidin  <cit> . the very low embryonic expression of globin genes is consistent with the transparent hemolymph flowing through the heart, which starts contracting after embryogenesis is two-thirds completed  <cit> . thus, the early larval expression of hemoglobins probably represents the initial stage of hemoglobin oxygen binding and coincides with gill development. the embryonic expression of β <dig> and the dominant mrna levels of α <dig> at hatching are in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis grouping these genes together with other fish globins expressed in embryonic stages  <cit> .

duplication and loss of hemoglobin genes have apparently occurred within specific teleost sublineages and have resulted in a variable number of α- and β-globins as summarized in figure  <dig>  the la locus comprises from two  to five globins , and the phylogenetic analysis of the highly similar β <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> globins in the cod cluster indicated a relatively recent gene duplication event in gadids  <cit> . whereas the cod mc locus contains four globins, this cluster harbors up to  <dig> globins in zebrafish, stickleback and medaka. maruyama et al.  <cit>  suggested that the latter globin cluster originated from a subcluster duplication, while subsequent gene silencing is evidenced by the ϖβ-ϖα pseudogene pair in medaka. in pufferfish, the mc locus has been reduced to only two α-globins  <cit> , while only remnants of an α-globin gene are found in icefishes inhabiting the cold polar ocean saturated with oxygen  <cit> . the metabolic functions are maintained in the hemoglobin-less icefishes by the elevated cardiac output of blood of low viscosity through the highly vascularized gills and skin  <cit> . although the arctic variant of cod β <dig> and a major β globin component of the pelagic antarctic teleosts pagothenia borchgrevinki and trematonus newnesi share only 58% sequence identity, similar functional features of these globins were recently hypothesized based on their close position in the pc  plane in the hydrophobicity analysis of multiple fish globins  <cit> .

the highly conserved linear order of the globin-flanking genes provides a strong anchor for inferring common ancestry of the vertebrate globin clusters. the proposed teleost-specific duplication of an ancient α-β globin cluster implies that paralogs of the flanking genes should still be present in both loci. in silico analysis of the teleost genomes available revealed linkage of rhbdf <dig>  arhgap <dig>  mgrn <dig>  aqp <dig> and foxj <dig> paralogs to the mc and la loci in several species. consistent with these findings, comparative gene mapping of medaka, zebrafish, pufferfish and human genomes demonstrated large conserved syntenic segments in paired fish chromosomes, including the globin-containing pairs of linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> , and  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit>  . furthermore, we found evidence for the origin of the rhbdf1-mpg-α-globin-arhgap17-lcmt <dig> syntenic region in man and chicken by screening the genomes of the tunicate ciona intestinalis and the lancelet branchiostoma floridae . four ciona globin genes designated cinhb1- <dig> were shown to form a monophyletic group basal to the vertebrate hemoglobin, myoglobin and cytoglobin  <cit> . we recognized cinhb <dig>  linked to mpg and arhgap <dig> on chromosome 3q, while an additional ciona globin gene  is coupled to rhbdf <dig> on chromosome 1q . in amphioxus, we identified rhbdf <dig> , mpg , arhgap <dig>  and lcmt  on the  <dig> -mb long scaffold  <dig>  which has been localized to the chordate linkage group   <dig> by fish analysis  <cit> . we were, however, unable to position any of the multiple globin genes to the  <dig> scaffolds spanning almost the complete clg <dig>  based on conserved chromosomal segments of the amphioxus and human genomes, putnam et al.  <cit>  reconstructed a total of  <dig> ancestral clgs of which clg <dig>  clg <dig> and clg <dig> showed syntenic association with the α-containing human chromosome  <dig>  although we presently lack information about any coupling of the amphioxus globin-like genes to these linkage groups, we propose that the fusion of clg <dig> to clg <dig> and clg <dig> resulted in the linkage of the rhbdf1-mpg-arhgap17-lcmt region to globin gene as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the identification of remnants of this globin linkage in the ciona genome indicates that the proposed chromosomal rearrangement occurred prior to the divergence of the vertebrates and urochordates about  <dig> mya  <cit> . thus, the formation of this syntenic region seems to have coincided with a period of earth history characterized by a rise in atmospheric oxygen from  <dig> - <dig>  atm  <dig> mya to present day levels of  <dig>  atm  <dig> mya  <cit> . the increased oxygen content would be expected to have a strong impact on the regulation and structure of h2s-binding globins. in sulfide-rich environments, the unusual sulfide-binding function is found in annelid globins containing key cysteine residues, which are absent in annelid globins from sulfide-free environments  <cit> . concomitant with increased atmospheric oxygen, the role of globins as oxygen scavengers would probably be lost in oxygen-tolerant organisms to function as oxygen-transporting hemoglobins. based on the close phylogenetic relation of cyclostome hemoglobins to gnathostome cytoglobins, the ancestors of cyclostome and gnathostome vertebrates were recently stated to have independently invented erythroid-specific oxygen-transporting hemoglobins about 450- <dig> mya  <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of the hemoglobins in extant vertebrates involves both proximal promoters and distant enhancers  <cit> . in mouse erythroid cells, the active α <dig> and α <dig> genes are in close spatial proximity of the flanking rhbdf <dig>  mpg and c16orf <dig>  including the cis-regulatory mres, as the result of erythroid-specific changes in the chromatin conformation  <cit> . the chromosomal rearrangements forming this highly conserved syntenic region seem to have occurred more than  <dig> mya, and we therefore propose that the molecular mechanism underlying the oxygen-dependent regulation of globin expression evolved prior to the structural changes in the duplicated ancestral globins.

CONCLUSIONS
in contrast to the low number of globin genes reported in antarctic teleosts  <cit> , the adaptation of atlantic cod to fluctuating environmental conditions probably involved the evolution of multiple globins with potentially different oxygen binding properties. the unlinked globin pairs α1-β <dig> and α2-β <dig> are abundantly expressed in the adult fish and form three major hemoglobin tetramers with different root effect. the identification of paralogous genes in the flanking regions of the two globin clusters in diverse teleosts supports the proposed teleost-specific duplication of the vertebrate globin cluster. based on the conserved synteny of globin-flanking genes in extant urochordate and cephalochordate species, we hypothesize that the ancestral globin cluster contained both the mc and la loci, and was formed by the fusion of three chordate chromosomes. we propose that these chromosomal rearrangements facilitated the transcriptional regulation of globin synthesis to cope with increased atmospheric oxygen content about  <dig> mya. thus, these regulatory changes probably preceded the convergent evolution of different ancestral globins to function as erythroid-specific oxygen transporting hemoglobins.
