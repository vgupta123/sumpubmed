BACKGROUND
plastids originate from a single endosymbiontic event involving a cyanobacterium-related organism  <cit> . in the course of endosymbiosis a massive gene transfer occurred, during which most plastidic genes were transferred to the host cell nucleus. consequently, today the majority of plastidic proteins must be post-translationally imported back into the organelle. so far, two protein translocation complexes have been characterized in the outer and inner envelope  membrane: toc and tic   <cit> . after passing the outer membrane via the toc translocon, the tic complex catalyses import across the ie membrane. so far, seven components have been unambiguously described as tic subunits: tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> .

tic <dig> is the largest, most abundant  <cit>  and best studied tic component. it contains two hydrophobic transmembrane-helices at its n-terminus, anchoring the protein in the membrane  <cit> , and four amphipathic α-helices in the large c-terminal domain that are responsible for channel formation  <cit> . at the intermembrane space side, tic <dig> contacts the toc machinery and recognizes preproteins  <cit> . moreover, loops facing the stroma provide a transit peptide docking site and recruit chaperones such as cpn <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit> .

tic <dig> is expressed in flowers, leaves, stems and root tissues, indicating a role in import in all types of plastids  <cit> . it is essential for chloroplast biogenesis and embryo development  <cit> . heterozygous knockout plants are clearly affected: they have a pale green phenotype, exhibit defects in plant growth, display strongly reduced amounts of thylakoid membranes and starch granules in chloroplasts, coupled with impaired protein translocation across the ie membrane.

tic <dig> is a second candidate within the tic complex that was proposed to constitute a protein translocation channel  <cit> . for instance, tic <dig> was detected in a cross-link with the toc complex after in vitro import experiments in pea  <cit> . in a more recent study, tic <dig> was found to form a complex of one megadalton containing a preprotein en route into the plastid after mild solubilization of pea and arabidopsis chloroplasts  <cit> , also suggesting its involvement in protein import.

tic <dig> is predicted to have four α-helical transmembrane domains, and is thus structurally related to mitochondrial inner membrane translocon proteins, namely tim <dig> and tim <dig> . distant sequence similarity was also reported between tic <dig> and two prokaryotic branched-chain amino acid transporters  <cit> . computational predictions place the n- and c-termini in the stroma , however, there is no experimental evidence for the proposed topology in higher plants. the only indication for a nin-cin topology is a result of a c-terminal gfp-fusion to a highly divergent member of the tic <dig> protein family from toxoplasma gondii  <cit> . in the same study, tgtic <dig> mutants were analysed for protein import into apicoplasts, a plastid type originating from secondary endosymbiosis, and it was found that also this distant homolog of tic <dig> is important, albeit probably as an accessory component.

the arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes four tic <dig> homologs: attic20-i, -ii, -iv and -v. attic20-i shows the closest homology to pisum sativum tic <dig> . it is present in all plant tissues, and its expression is highest during rapid leaf growth  <cit> . attic20-i antisense plants exhibit a severe pale phenotype, growth defects and deficiency in plastid function, such as smaller plastids, reduced thylakoids, decreased content of plastidic proteins, and altered import rates of preproteins  <cit> . knockouts of attic20-i are albino even in the youngest parts of the seedlings  <cit> . the presence of another closely related tic <dig> homolog  may prevent attic20-i plants from lethality, since tic20-iv is upregulated in the mutants  <cit> . however, additional overexpression of attic20-iv can only compensate the observed defects to a very low extent indicating that attic20-iv cannot fully substitute for the function of attic20-i  <cit> . two more distantly related homologs are also present in arabidopsis . however, their closest orthologs are cyanobacterial proteins  <cit> , and even though a chloroplast transit peptide is weakly predicted  <cit> , their localization  in the cell remain unknown  <cit> .

based on structural similarity to channel-forming proteins, cross-links to imported preprotein and protein import defects detectable in the knockdown mutants, it was hypothesized that tic <dig> forms a protein translocation channel in the ie membrane  <cit> . furthermore, a cross-link of a minor fraction of tic <dig> to tic <dig> in a toc-tic supercomplex  <cit>  indicates an association of the two proteins. therefore, it was proposed that the two proteins possibly cooperate in channel formation. however, there was no cross-link detected between the two proteins in the absence of the toc complex, making a direct or permanent interaction unlikely  <cit> . recently, tic <dig> was demonstrated to be a component of a one megadalton translocation complex detected on bn-page after in vitro import into pea and arabidopsis chloroplasts  <cit> . tic <dig> could not be observed in this translocation complex, it formed a different, several hundred kilodalton smaller complex, supporting the idea that the two proteins do not associate. however, the expected channel activity of tic <dig> has not been demonstrated experimentally yet.

in this work we explored the role of tic <dig> in relation to tic <dig> in more detail. we analysed the expression of tic <dig> in pisum sativum  and arabidopsis thaliana  by quantitative rt-pcr, and compared it directly with the expression of tic <dig> in both organisms. furthermore, semi-quantitative immunoblot analyses revealed the absolute amounts of tic <dig> and tic <dig> in chloroplast envelopes. moreover, we showed that tic <dig> and tic <dig> are not part of a mutual complex in isolated pea ie. after the successful expression and purification of tic <dig> we were able to experimentally verify its predicted α-helical structure and nin-cin topology. finally, we report for the first time that tic <dig> forms a cation selective channel when reconstituted into liposomes.

RESULTS
tic <dig> and tic <dig> display a differential expression pattern
due to errors in the annotation of attic20-i, currently available affymetrix micro-arrays do not contain specific oligonucleotides for this isoform and therefore cannot be used to investigate the expression levels of attic20-i  <cit> . we designed specific primers for tic <dig> and tic <dig> in pea and arabidopsis and performed a quantitative rt-pcr  analysis to obtain comprehensive and more reliable quantitative data about the expression of tic <dig> than those available from semi-quantitative analysis and the massively parallel signature sequencing database  <cit> .

for the analysis, rna was isolated from leaves and roots of two-week-old pea seedlings as well as four-week-old arabidopsis plants. arabidopsis was grown hydroponically to provide easy access to root tissue. in all samples, expression of tic <dig> was analysed in direct comparison to tic <dig> .

in pea, expression of both genes was found to be lower in root tissue as compared to leaves. in roots, pstic <dig> rna is 40% more abundant, while in leaves the expression levels of pstic <dig> and pstic <dig> seem to be in a similar range. in arabidopsis, attic20-i and attic <dig> are expressed to a lower extent in roots than in leaves, similar to pea . these results seemingly contradict those of hirabayashi et al.  <cit> , who concluded a comparable expression level of tic20-i in shoots and roots. however, they used a non-quantifiable approach in contrast to our quantitative analysis. furthermore, in our experiments the overall expression of attic20-i and attic <dig> differs notably from that in pea, attic <dig> rna being about  <dig>  and  <dig> times more abundant than attic20-i in leaves and roots, respectively.

we also designed specific primers for the second tic <dig> homolog in arabidopsis, attic20-iv, and our quantitative method was sufficiently sensitive to precisely define its rna levels in arabidopsis leaves and roots, allowing direct comparison with the expression of attic20-i and attic <dig> . transcription of attic20-iv had also been investigated in parallel to attic <dig> by teng et al.  <cit> , who observed a differential ratio of expression using two different methods, of which one was not even sensitive enough to detect attic20-iv. a very recent study  <cit>  also investigated the expression of attic20-iv, however, without any quantification of their data.

our data show that attic20-iv is present in leaves and roots with transcript levels similar to attic20-i, but less abundant than attic <dig>  interestingly, and in accordance with the data presented by hirabayashi et al.  <cit> , transcript levels of attic20-iv in roots are higher than those of attic20-i, while the opposite is true in leaf tissue. it can be speculated that the observed expression pattern reflects tissue-specific differentiation of both genes. attic20-iv may still partially complement for the function of attic20-i, as becomes evident from the viability of attic20-i knockout plants and the yellowish phenotype of attic20-i mutants overexpressing attic20-iv  <cit> . however, the severe phenotype of attic20-i plants, in conjunction with the observed differential expression pattern, clearly indicates specific functions of the two homologs. furthermore, a higher attic <dig> expression rate as observed in antisense attic20-i lines might indicate another possible compensatory effect  <cit> .

the expression pattern of the three investigated genes was found to be similar in arabidopsis growing hydroponically with or without sucrose  or on soil . however, gene expression was generally higher in plants growing without sucrose.

tic <dig> protein is much less abundant than tic <dig> in envelope membranes
semi-quantitative analysis of tic <dig> and tic <dig> on protein level was performed using immunoblots of envelope membranes isolated from two-week-old pea and four-week-old arabidopsis plants. in parallel, calibration curves were generated using a series of known concentrations of overexpressed and purified proteins . after quantification of immunoblots from envelopes, amounts of pstic <dig>  pstic <dig>  attic <dig> and attic <dig> were determined using the corresponding calibration curve. the amount of pstic <dig> in ie was found to be almost eight times higher than that of pstic <dig> , which differs strikingly from the similar transcript levels of the two genes detected in leaves , indicating profound differences in posttranslational processes such as translation rate and protein turnover. in arabidopsis, the absolute amount of attic <dig> is nearly the same as in pea , however, arabidopsis envelopes represent a mixture, containing both outer and ie vesicles. thus, the relative amount of attic <dig> is possibly higher than in pea. surprisingly, the amount of attic <dig> is more than  <dig> times lower than that of attic <dig>  showing an even greater difference in comparison to the observed rna expression levels . taking the different molecular size of tic <dig> and tic <dig> into account , we still observe  <dig> times more attic <dig> than attic <dig> protein. in pea, we found  <dig>  times more tic <dig> rna than tic <dig>  whereas in arabidopsis the ratio of tic <dig> to tic <dig> is  <dig> . the number of channel forming units must even be more different, since tic <dig> was shown to form dimers  <cit> , whereas tic <dig> builds very large complexes between  <dig> kda  and  <dig> mda  <cit> . thus, two tic <dig> molecules would be necessary to form a channel in contrast to tic <dig>  which would require many more molecules to form the pore. though we cannot exclude that tic <dig> might be subject to degradation by an unknown protease in vivo, protease treatments with thermolysin of right-side out ie vesicles in vitro clearly shows that tic <dig> is very protease resistant, even in the presence of detergent. in contrast, tic <dig> is easily degraded already without addition of detergent . this argues against more rapid degradation of tic <dig> compared to tic <dig> during preparation of ie. the difference in tic <dig> to tic <dig> ratios both on the rna and protein level between pea and arabidopsis may be due to the different age of the plants or the different needs under the given growth conditions, and suggests that there is no strict stoichiometry between the two proteins. moreover, the low abundance of tic <dig> in comparison to tic <dig> in envelopes  clearly demonstrates that tic <dig> cannot be the main channel of the tic translocon as previously suggested  <cit> , since it cannot possibly support the required import rates of some highly abundant preproteins that are needed in the chloroplast.

tic <dig> forms high molecular weight complexes separately from tic110
experimental data suggested a common complex between tic <dig> and tic <dig> in chloroplast envelope membranes using a cross-linking approach  <cit> . however, the interaction was not visible in the absence of toc components, making a stable association unlikely. furthermore, no evidence for a common complex was found by kikuchi et al.  <cit>  using solubilized chloroplasts of pea and arabidopsis for two-dimensional blue native/sds-page  analysis. likewise, the difference in tic <dig> to tic <dig> ratios both on the rna and protein level between pea and arabidopsis indicates that a common complex, in which both proteins cooperate in translocation channel formation in a reasonable stoichiometry, is improbable.

to clarify this issue, we addressed these partly conflicting results by using ie vesicles, which should minimize the possible influence of the interaction with toc components on complex formation. pea ie vesicles were solubilized in 5% digitonin and subjected to 2d bn/sds-page. immunoblots revealed that both tic <dig> and tic <dig> are present in distinct high molecular weight complexes : tic110-containing complexes migrate at a size of ~ 200- <dig> kda, whereas tic <dig> displays a much slower mobility in bn-page and is present in complexes exceeding  <dig> kda, in line with the results from kikuchi et al.  <cit> . however, at a similar molecular weight of  <dig> kda on bn-page not only tic <dig> but also hsp <dig>  tic <dig> and tic <dig> were described  <cit> . the molecular weight of a complex containing all of these components would be much higher. therefore, components of the tic complex might associate with tic <dig> very dynamically resulting in different compositions under different conditions, or alternatively, there are different complexes present at the same molecular weight.

an open question to date is the identity of possible interaction partners of tic <dig> in the complex. tic <dig>  the only tic component located in the intermembrane space, is a potential candidate, since both proteins were identified together in cross-linking experiments  <cit> . however, only minor amounts of tic <dig> and tic <dig> were shown to co-localize after gel filtration of solubilized envelope membranes  <cit> . a second candidate for common complex formation is pic1/tic21: kikuchi et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a one-megadalton complex of tic <dig> contains pic1/tic <dig> as a minor subunit. pic1/tic <dig> was proposed to form a protein translocation channel in the tic complex, mainly based on protein import defects of knockout mutants and on structural similarities to amino acid transporters and sugar permeases  <cit> . an independent study by duy et al.  <cit>  favours the hypothesis that pic1/tic <dig> forms a metal permease in the ie of chloroplasts, rendering the import-related role questionable. this discrepancy will have to be addressed in the future.

to test the complex formation of tic <dig> in vitro without the involvement of other proteins, we used tic20-proteoliposomes for 2d bn/sds-page analysis, similarly to ie vesicles . the migration behaviour of the protein resembles that observed in ie: the majority of the protein localizes in high molecular weight range, however, the signal appears more widespread and a portion is also detected at lower molecular weights, possibly as monomers. this observation reveals that tic <dig> has the inherent ability to homo-oligomerize in the presence of a lipid bilayer. the less distinct signal could be due to different solubilization of tic <dig> by digitonin in ie vesicles vs. liposomes, or could be an indication that additional subunits stabilize the endogenous tic <dig> complexes, which are not present after the reconstitution. however, we interpret these observations as support for the hypothesis that the major component of the one megadalton complex in ie are homo-oligomers composed of tic <dig> 

the n- and c-termini of tic <dig> face the stromal side
in silico analysis of tic <dig> predicts the presence of four hydrophobic transmembrane helices positioning both n- and c-termini to one side of the membrane . according to these predictions, three cysteins  in pstic <dig> face the same side, while the fourth would be located in the plane of the membrane. we used pea ie vesicles prepared in a right-side-out orientation  <cit>  to determine the topology of tic <dig> employing a cys-labelling technique. to this end, the ie vesicles were incubated with a membrane-impermeable, cys-reactive agent  that adds a molecular weight of  <dig>  da to the target protein for each reactive cys residue. in our experiments peg-mal did not strongly label any cys residues of tic <dig> under the conditions applied , indicating the absence of accessible cys residues on the outside of the membrane. only one faint additional band of higher molecular weight was detectable , possibly due to a partially accessible cys located within the membrane. in the presence of 1% sds, however, all four cys residues present in pstic <dig> are rapidly pegylated, as demonstrated by the appearance of four intense additional bands after only five minutes of incubation. the observed gain in molecular weight per modification is bigger than the expected  <dig> kda for each cys, but this can be attributed to an aberrant mobility of the modified protein in the bis-tris/sds-page used in the assay.

our results support a four transmembrane helix topology in which both the c- and n-termini are facing the stromal side of the membrane , with no cys residues oriented towards the intermembrane space. cys <dig> is most likely located in helix one, cys <dig> and cys <dig> are oriented to the stromal side of helix four and cys <dig> is located in the stroma. this topology is also in line with green fluorescent protein-labelling studies by van dooren et al.  <cit>  indicating that the n- and c-termini also of the toxoplasma gondii homolog of tic <dig> face the stromal side of the inner apicoplast membrane.

tic <dig> is mainly α-helical
tic <dig> was identified more than a decade ago but since then no heterologous expression and purification procedure has been reported, which could successfully synthesize folded full-length tic <dig>  here, we report two efficient escherichia coli  based systems for tic <dig> expression and purification from both pea and arabidopsis: codon optimized pstic <dig>  was overexpressed in a s <dig> cell lysate in presence of detergents, and attic <dig> overexpression was successfully accomplished by adaptation of a special induction system  <cit> . following these steps, both pea and arabidopsis proteins could be purified to homogeneity by metal affinity purification .

using the purified protein, we performed structural characterization studies of tic <dig> by subjecting it to circular dichroism  spectroscopy . the recorded spectra of pstic <dig>  displaying two minima at  <dig> and  <dig> nm and a large peak of positive ellipticity centered at  <dig> nm, are highly characteristic of α-helical proteins, and thus demonstrate that the protein exists in a folded state after purification in the presence of detergent. the secondary structure of tic <dig> was estimated by fitting spectra to reference data sets  resulting in an α-helical content of approximately 78%, confirming in silico predictions  <cit> .

purified tic <dig> protein inserts firmly into liposomes
to better characterize tic <dig> in a membrane-mimicking environment, heterologously expressed and purified attic <dig> was reconstituted into liposomes in vitro. initially, flotation experiments were performed to verify a stable insertion. in the presence or absence of liposomes, tic <dig> was placed at the bottom of a gradient ranging from  <dig>  m  to  <dig>  m  sucrose. in the presence of liposomes, tic <dig> migrated to the middle of the gradient, indicating a change in its density caused by interaction with liposomes. in contrast, the protein alone remained at the bottom of the gradient . proteoliposomes were also treated with various buffers before flotation , to test whether the protein is firmly inserted into the liposomal membrane or just loosely bound to the vesicle surface. none of the applied conditions  changed the migration behaviour of tic <dig> in the gradient , indicating that tic <dig> was deeply inserted into the liposomal membrane. thus, proteoliposomes represent a suitable in vitro system for the analysis of tic <dig> channel activity.

tic <dig> forms a channel in liposomes
even though tic <dig> has long been suggested to form a channel in the ie membrane, this notion was solely based on structural analogy to other four-transmembrane helix proteins  <cit> , and no experimental evidence has been provided so far. to investigate whether tic <dig> can indeed form an ion channel, tic20-proteoliposomes were subjected to swelling assays . changes in the size of liposomes in the presence of high salt concentrations, as revealed by changes in the optical density, can be used to detect the presence of a pore-forming protein  <cit> . after addition of  <dig> mm kcl to liposomes and tic20-proteoliposomes, their optical densities dropped initially, due to shrinkage caused by the increased salt concentration  <cit> . however, the optical density of protein-free liposomes remained at this low level, showing no change in their size; whereas in the case of tic20-proteoliposomes the optical density increased constantly with time. the increase in optical density  strongly supports the presence of a channel in tic20-proteoliposomes that is permeable for ions, thereby creating an equilibrium between the inner compartment of the proteoliposomes and the surrounding buffer.

to exclude the possible effects of  contaminating channel-forming proteins derived from the bacterial membrane and  a protein inserted into the liposomes , a further negative control was set up: tic <dig> containing only the first three transmembrane helices  was purified similarly to tic <dig> and reconstituted into liposomes. we chose this construct, since nttic <dig> inserts into the membrane during in vitro protein import experiments  <cit> . furthermore, as the full length and n-terminally truncated tic <dig> possess very similar channel activities  <cit> , it is unlikely that the n-terminal part alone forms a channel. the insertion of nttic <dig> into liposomes was confirmed by incubation under different buffer conditions  followed by flotation experiments, similarly to tic <dig> . however, these nttic110-proteoliposomes behaved similarly to the empty liposomes during swelling assays: after addition of salt, the optical density decreased, and except for a small initial increase, it remained at a constant level . this makes it unlikely that a contamination from e. coli or simply the insertion of a protein into the liposomes caused the observed effect in the optical density of tic20-proteoliposomes.

to further characterize the channel activity of tic <dig>  electrophysiological measurements were performed. after the fusion of tic20-proteoliposomes with a lipid bilayer, ion channel activity was observed . the total conductance under symmetrical buffer conditions ,  <dig> mm kcl) was dependent on the direction of the applied potential:  <dig> ps  and  <dig> ps  under negative and positive voltage values, respectively. the channel was mostly in the completely open state, however, individual single gating events were also frequently observed, varying in a broad range between  <dig> ps to  <dig> ps . all detected gating events were depicted in two histograms . two conductance classes  were defined both at negative and positive voltage values with thresholds of  <dig> ps and  <dig> ps, respectively . note that gating events belonging to the smaller conductance classes  occurred more frequently. the observed pore seems to be asymmetric, since higher conductance classes notably differ under positive and negative voltages. this is probably due to interactions of the permeating ions with the channel, which presumably exhibits an asymmetric potential profile along the pore. since small and large opening events were simultaneously observed in all experiments, it is very unlikely that they belong to two different pores.

the selectivity of tic <dig> was investigated under asymmetric salt conditions , 250/ <dig> mm kcl). similarly to the conductance values, the channel is intrinsically rectifying , supporting asymmetric channel properties. the obtained reverse potential is  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv . according to the goldman-hodgkin-katz approach, this corresponds to a selectivity of  <dig> : <dig> for k+:cl--ions, thus indicating cation selectivity similar to tic <dig>  <cit> .

to determine the channel's orientation within the bilayer, two side-specific characteristics were taken into account: the highest total conductance under symmetrical buffer conditions was measured under negative voltage values, and the channel rectifies in the same direction under asymmetrical buffer conditions . therefore, it seems that the protein is randomly inserted into the bilayer.

the pore size was roughly estimated according to hille et al.  <cit> . considering the highest conductance class , a channel length of 1- <dig> nm and a resistivity of  <dig>  Ω cm for a solution containing  <dig> mm kcl, taking into account that the conductivity of the electrolyte solution within the pore is ~ <dig> times lower than in the bulk solution  <cit> , the pore size was estimated to vary between  <dig> - <dig>  Å. this is in good agreement with the size of protein translocation channels such as toc <dig>  in the outer envelope membrane and tic <dig>  in the ie. thus, the size of the tic <dig> pore would be sufficient for the translocation of precursor proteins through the membrane.

nttic <dig>  as a negative control, did not show any channel activity during electrophysiological measurements, indicating that the measured channel is not the result of a possible bacterial contamination .

considering our data presented here and those published in previous studies, we can conclude that the tic translocon consists of distinct  translocation channels: on the one hand, tic <dig> forms the main translocation pore and therefore facilitates import of most of the chloroplast-targeted preproteins; on the other hand, tic <dig> might facilitate the translocation of a subset of proteins. this scenario would match the one found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where specific translocases exist for defined groups of precursor proteins: the import pathway of mitochondrial carrier proteins being clearly separated from that of matrix targeted preproteins  <cit> . the situation in chloroplasts does not seem as clear-cut, but an analogous separation determined by the final destination and/or intrinsic properties of translocated proteins is feasible.

the severe phenotype of attic20-i mutants prompts us to hypothesize that tic <dig> might be specifically required for the translocation of some essential proteins. according to cross-linking results  <cit> , tic <dig> is connected to toc translocon components. therefore, after entering the intermembrane space via the toc complex, some preproteins might be transported through the ie via tic <dig>  on the contrary, kikuchi et al.  <cit>  presented that tic <dig> migrates on bn-page at the same molecular weight as the imported precursor of the small subunit of rubisco  and that tic20-i mutants display a reduced rate of the artificial precursor protein rbcs-nt:gfp. the authors interpreted these results in a way that tic <dig> might function at an intermediate step between the toc translocon and the channel of tic <dig>  however, being a substantial part of the general import pathway seems unlikely due to the very low abundance of tic <dig>  it is feasible to speculate that such abundant proteins as pssu, which are imported at a very high rate, may interact incidentally with nearby proteins or indifferently use all available import channels. to clarify this question, substrate proteins and interaction partners of tic <dig> should be a matter of further investigation.

additionally, a very recent study  <cit>  suggested attic20-iv as an import channel working side by side with attic20-i. however, detailed characterization of the protein  and experimental evidence for channel activity are still missing.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we could clearly demonstrate that tic <dig> and tic <dig> function separately from each other, based on their different stoichiometry and their independent complex formation in ie vesicles. we furthermore present the first experimental evidence for tic <dig> channel function. the very low abundance of tic <dig> compared to tic <dig> argues against tic <dig> forming a major protein translocation channel, which would import the large number of preproteins that are needed in the chloroplast. therefore, our data favour the idea that the tic translocon comprises at least two translocation channels: tic <dig>  constituting the main import channel  <cit> , and tic <dig>  which might import a special subset of preproteins . a similar system exists in the inner membrane of mitochondria, where the tim <dig> and tim <dig> complexes mediate the import of different sets of proteins  <cit> . unfortunately, due to the lethality of tic <dig> and the very severe phenotype of tic20-i homozygous knockout mutants, their separate mode of action will be very difficult to investigate in vivo.
