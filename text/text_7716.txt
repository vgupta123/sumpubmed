BACKGROUND
a large body of accumulated evidence suggests that insulin resistance and impairments in cerebral insulin receptor signaling may contribute to age-related cognitive deficits and alzheimer's disease   <cit> . the enhancement of brain insulin receptor signaling is, therefore, a promising strategy for the treatment of age-related cognitive disorders. optimal insulin receptor signaling requires hydrogen peroxide  generated in cells during insulin stimulation  <cit> . the mitochondrial respiratory chain, being involved in insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production, has been identified recently as a potential target for the enhancement of insulin signaling  <cit> . the rate of insulin-stimulated h2o <dig> production depends on the concentration of respiratory substrate, succinate  <cit> .

the aim of the present study is to examine:  whether a specific respiratory substrate, dicholine salt of succinic acid , can enhance insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons, and  whether cs can ameliorate cognitive deficits of various origins in animal models.

RESULTS
dicholine salt of succinic acid enhances insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons
to examine whether cs enhances the insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptor in neurons, we studied an effect of cs on insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation in a primary culture of rat cerebellar granule neurons . figure  <dig> shows that, whereas by itself,  <dig> μmol/l of cs does not stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation significantly , this concentration of cs significantly enhances the effect of suboptimal concentration of  <dig> nmol/l insulin . cs significantly enhances insulin-stimulated insulin receptor autophosphorylation in the range of concentrations from  <dig> to  <dig> μmol/l , although no significant difference is observed between the effects of different concentrations of cs. these results suggest that cs is a neuronal insulin sensitizer, which works in concert with insulin to stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

dicholine salt of succinic acid improves cognition and neuron functioning in middle-aged mice
to examine whether dicholine salt of succinic acid can ameliorate age-related cognitive deficits, 16-month-old middle-aged c57bl/ <dig> mice  were treated with cs  or saline  for seven consecutive days. then, behavioral tests and measurement of whole-brain n-acetylaspartate/creatine  ratio by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy  in vivo were carried out on days as indicated in the experimental schedule . 5-month-old young adult mice were treated with i.p. saline for  <dig> days.

as shown in figure  <dig>  there was a significant difference in spontaneous locomotor activity in the open field between control middle-aged mice and young adult mice . cs significantly increased the locomotor activity of middle-aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls, when administered in doses of 1– <dig> mg/kg .

as shown in figure  <dig>  there was no significant difference in step-down latencies in the passive avoidance test between young adult mice, control middle-aged mice, and cs-treated middle-aged mice on a day of acquisition trial. however,  <dig> hours later, in the retention test, middle-aged mice exhibited a significant decrease in step-down latencies  as compared to young adult mice, indicating a learning deficit induced by aging. cs increased retention latencies in middle-aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls, when administered in doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg . these data suggest that cs significantly improves passive avoidance learning in middle-aged mice, as compared to the age-matched controls.

as shown in figure  <dig>  both path length and latency to escape to the hidden platform in the morris water maze decreased progressively  during the 4-day training period in all groups of mice. two-way anova revealed significant day effect in all experimental groups . there was a significant difference, however, between middle-aged mice and young adult mice on the third day  and the fourth day  of the training, indicating that spatial learning in middle-aged mice was slower, as compared to young adult mice. two-way anova revealed significant group effect across days  and group × day interaction , when groups of young adult and middle-aged mice were compared. cs significantly decreased the escape latencies in middle-aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls, at the fourth day of the training, when administered in doses of 1– <dig> mg/kg . two-way anova revealed significant effect for cs doses of  <dig> mg/kg  and  <dig> mg/kg  across days and significant both group effect  and group × day interaction  for dose of  <dig> mg/kg. cs significantly decreased the path lengths in middle-aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls, on the day  <dig> of training, when administered in doses of 1– <dig> mg/kg . two-way anova revealed significant group effects for cs doses of  <dig> mg/kg  and  <dig>  across days and significant both group effect  and group × day interaction  for cs dose of  <dig> mg/kg. these data suggest that cs significantly improved spatial learning in middle-aged mice, as compared to the age-matched controls.

n-acetylaspartate/creatine  ratio is widely believed to be a reliable noninvasive marker of neuronal function and viability in the adult brain. as shown in figure  <dig>  middle-aged mice exhibited a significant 30% drop in whole-brain brain naa/cr levels  by data of 1h-mrs in vivo study, as compared to young adult mice, thus indicating age-related decline in neuronal function. when administered in doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg, cs significantly increased whole-brain naa/cr levels in middle-aged mice, as compared to the age-matched controls . these data suggest that cs significantly improved neuron functioning in middle-aged mice.

dicholine salt of succinic acid improves cognition and neuron functioning in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion
to examine whether cs can ameliorate cognitive deficits induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, rats with permanent bilateral carotid artery occlusion  were treated with cs  or saline  for seven consecutive days, and a battery of tests were carried out on days as summarized in the experimental schedule . sham-operated rats were treated with i.p. saline for  <dig> days.

as shown in figure  <dig>  there was no significant difference in step-through latencies to enter the dark compartment in passive avoidance test between sham-operated rats, control 2vo rats, and cs-treated 2vo rats on the day of acquisition trial. however,  <dig> hours later, in the retention test, 2vo rats exhibited significant decrease in step-through latencies as compared to sham-operated rats , indicating a learning deficit induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. cs significantly increased retention latencies in 2vo rats, as compared to control 2vo rats, when administered in doses of 1– <dig> mg/kg . these data suggest that cs significantly improved passive avoidance learning in rats with chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.

as shown in figure  <dig>  2vo rats exhibited a significant 22% decrease in whole-brain naa/cr levels, as compared to sham-operated rats , indicating impairments in neuronal function induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. cs significantly increased whole-brain naa/cr levels in 2vo rats, as compared to controls, when administered in doses of 1– <dig> mg/kg .

there was no significant difference between 2vo rats treated with choline chloride  and control 2vo rats  in passive avoidance performance  and in spatial learning . hence, choline chloride, a reference choline compound, showed no significant therapeutic effect on cognitive deficits in 2vo rats. however, mrs data indicate a role of choline in normalization of naa/cr deficits.

dicholine salt of succinic acid improves learning and increases activity of brain choline acetyltransferase in rats with β-amyloid peptide--induced amnesia
to examine whether cs can ameliorate cognitive deficits induced in rats by a single injection of β-amyloid peptide- into the brain nucleus basalis magnocellularis , the β-amyloid peptide--induced rats were treated with cs  or saline  for seven consecutive days. sham-operated rats induced by a single injection of saline into the brain nbm were treated with i.p. saline for  <dig> days. step-through passive avoidance test and measurement of activity of choline acetyltransferase  in brain cortex homogenates were carried out on days, as indicated in the experimental schedule .

as shown in figure  <dig>  there was a significant difference in step-through latencies to enter the dark compartment in passive avoidance test between sham-operated rats and control β-amyloid peptide--induced rats, on the day of acquisition , and  <dig> hours later, on the day of retention trials . on the day of acquisition trials, cs significantly decreased step-through latencies, as compared to the controls, when administered in doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg . on the day of retention trials, cs significantly increased step-through latencies, as compared to the control, when administered in doses of  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg . these data suggest that cs significantly improves passive avoidance learning in rats with β-amyloid peptide--induced amnesia.

as shown in table  <dig>  there was a significant 27% decrease in chat activity in the control β-amyloid peptide--induced rats, as compared to sham-operated rats , indicating cholinergic dysfunction induced by β-amyloid peptide- toxicity. cs significantly increased chat activity in rats with β-amyloid peptide--induced amnesia, when administered in the highest studied dose of  <dig> mg/kg .

chat activity in brain cortex homogenates was assayed by radiometry on the day as indicated in the experimental schedule . sh, sham-operated rats ; ctr, β-amyloid peptide--induced rats ; ch, β-amyloid peptide--induced rats treated i.p. for  <dig> days with choline chloride in dose of  <dig> mg/kg; cs <dig>  cs <dig>  and cs <dig>  β-amyloid peptide--induced rats treated i.p. for  <dig> days with cs in doses of  <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> mg/kg respectively. each group comprised eight rats. data represent the chat activity means ± sem expressed as dpm/mg of wet tissue. *p <  <dig>  vs. ctr. †p <  <dig>  vs. sh.

choline chloride , the reference choline compound, showed no significant effect on passive avoidance learning and cerebral chat activity in rats with β-amyloid peptide--induced amnesia, when administered for  <dig> days.

discussion
in the present study we identified a highly effective treatment of cognitive deficits of various origins with dicholine salt of succinic acid, the neuronal insulin sensitizer.

initially, we examined whether cs can work as an insulin sensitizer in the brain. it is generally accepted that insulin signaling requires autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor kinase at tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the kinase domain  <cit> . upon autophosphorylation, the receptor undergoes a major conformational change, resulting in unrestricted access of protein substrates and atp to the kinase active site and an approximate two-order increase in the kinase activity  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that, although cs alone does not stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation significantly, it significantly enhances the response to the suboptimal insulin concentration. the effect of the combination of insulin and cs is much greater than sum of effects of insulin and cs taken alone. these results suggest that cs is a neuronal insulin sensitizer, which works in concert with insulin to stimulate insulin receptor autophosphorylation in neurons.

dicholine salt of succinic acid is a chemical substance, but its components, choline and succinate, are naturally occurring metabolites widely distributed in mammalian tissues. average concentrations of succinate and choline in the blood of healthy humans at rest are 1– <dig> μmol/l  <cit>  and 7– <dig> μmol/l  <cit>  respectively. during physical exercises or severe hypoxia, levels of succinate and choline increase markedly  <cit> . for example, breath-hold dives for  <dig> min and treadmill running increases venous succinate in humans to  <dig> and  <dig> μmol/l respectively  <cit> . this means that cs is an effective insulin sensitizer at physiologically occurring concentrations, typically observed in mammals during hypoxia or apneic work.

we further investigated the effects of intraperitoneal administration of cs on cognition and neuronal function in animals with cognitive deficits of various origins.

to examine whether cs, the neuronal insulin sensitizer, can ameliorate cognitive deficits induced by normal aging, experiments with middle-aged c57bl/ <dig> mice were carried out. these mice represent a model of a mild cognitive deficit associated with age-related changes in the expression of genes, including genes with possible roles in synaptic plasticity and learning  <cit> , while neuronal loss with aging is relatively rare in mice of this strain  <cit> . we demonstrate that cs significantly improves passive avoidance learning, spontaneous locomotor activity, and spatial learning in middle-aged mice, as compared to age-matched controls. to test whether cs can ameliorate neuronal dysfunction in middle-aged mice, 1h-mrs in vivo study was carried out in addition to tests listed above. it is generally accepted that the brain level of n-acetylaspartate , frequently expressed as n-acetylaspartate/creatine ratio, is a reliable noninvasive marker of neuronal integrity and functioning, since naa is localized almost exclusively to neurons in the adult brain and naa decrease is closely correlated with neuronal loss or neuronal dysfunction  <cit> . reversible naa deficits reflect a reversible state of neuronal dysfunction preceding neuronal loss  <cit> . naa quantification is, therefore, considered to be a valuable tool for assessing the effects of potential neuroprotective therapies. in this study, age-related naa deficits in middle-aged mice were reversed after the treatment with cs, indicating the neuroprotective effect of cs. taken together, results in middle-aged mice demonstrate that cs ameliorates both age-related cognitive deficits and neuronal dysfunction caused by normal aging. these cs effects were long-lasting beyond the seven-day treatment period and were found to be significant about two weeks following the treatment.

to determine whether cs, the neuronal insulin sensitizer, can ameliorate cognitive deficits induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, experiments with 2vo rats were carried out. although originally described as a rat model for vascular dementia, the chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by permanent bilateral carotid artery occlusion is relevant to alzheimer's disease, since there is also a slowly developing reduction in cerebral blood flow in this condition  <cit> . the two-vessel occlusion causes a chronic decrease in the cerebral blood flow to 52–64% of the original level  <cit>  and induces progressive and long-lasting cognitive deficit, cholinergic dysfunction, and progressive neuronal damage in the brain  <cit> . in this study, we found that cs significantly improved passive avoidance learning and spatial learning in 2vo rats, as compared to the control 2vo rats. naa deficits in brains of 2vo rats were also reversible on the treatment with cs. thus, cs ameliorates both cognitive deficits and neuronal dysfunction in 2vo rats. these cs effects were long-lasting, extending beyond the seven-day treatment period, and were found to be significant ten days following the cs treatment.

there is evidence that β-amyloid, a hallmark of alzheimer's disease, can interfere with insulin receptor signaling  <cit> , whereas insulin stimulates clearance and degradation of β-amyloid and thus prevents β-amyloid accumulation in the brain  <cit> . activity of choline acetyltransferase, a key enzyme of acetylcholine biosynthesis, is reduced in insulin receptor-positive neurons in alzheimer's disease and expression of choline acetyltransferase is increased with insulin stimulation  <cit> . these findings provide a rationale for the use of insulin and insulin sensitizers in the treatment of cognitive deficits caused by β-amyloid toxicity. in the present study, we examined the effect of cs, the neuronal insulin sensitizer, on cognitive deficits induced in rats by a single injection of β-amyloid peptide- into brain nucleus basalis magnocellularis. such injection causes behavioral dysfunctions, impairs learning and memory, and disrupts cortical cholinergic innervations, thus modeling alzheimer's disease  <cit> . also, β-amyloid peptide- decreases activity of brain choline acetyltransferase, a key enzyme of acetylcholine biosynthesis  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate that cs significantly improves passive avoidance learning and increases chat activity in the brains of β-amyloid peptide--induced rats. the cs effects lasted beyond the seven-day treatment period and were found to be significant two weeks following the treatment.

choline chloride, the reference choline compound, was used in the present study to discriminate the effects of choline and succinate moieties in the cs molecule. as compared to highly effective cs treatment, choline chloride demonstrated no significant effects on cognitive performance in 2vo rats and rats with β-amyloid peptide--induced amnesia. however, mrs data reveal a role for choline in normalization of naa/cr deficits in brain of 2vo rats. this indicates that although cs effects relates mainly to the action of succinate, the neuroprotective effect of cs is caused, at least in part, by the presence of choline moiety in the cs molecule.

earlier, several lines of evidence have suggested that treating insulin resistance might improve cognitive function. it has been reported that rosiglitazone, a peripheral insulin sensitizer and potent ppar full agonist, attenuates learning and memory deficits in tg <dig> alzheimer mice  <cit> . in a small pilot study, rosiglitazone appeared to significantly improve the cognitive ability of ad patients  <cit> . in a phase ii clinical study, rosiglitazone was found to improve the cognitive ability of mild to moderate ad patients  <cit> . it has been proposed that pparγ agonism induces neuronal mitochondrial biogenesis and improves glucose utilization leading to improved cellular function and provides mechanistic support for the improvement in cognition observed in treatment of alzheimer's patients with rosiglitazone  <cit> .

in general, the results of the present study support the idea that targeting insulin receptor signaling in neurons may help to reduce both cognitive deficits and neuronal dysfunctions associated with aging and alzheimer's disease.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of the present study suggest that dicholine salt of succinic acid, the novel neuronal insulin sensitizer, ameliorates cognitive deficits and neuronal dysfunctions in animal models relevant to age-related cognitive impairments, vascular dementia, and alzheimer's disease.
