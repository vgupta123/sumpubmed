BACKGROUND
the three corynebacterium  species c. diphtheriae, c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis form the c. diphtheriae group as recently shown by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis and dna-dna hybridization studies  <cit> . strains of this group might carry lysogenic β-corynephages which can harbor the tox-gene encoding diphtheria toxin , a virulence factor inhibiting protein synthesis  <cit> . moreover, both c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis may produce the dermonecrotic exotoxin phospholipase d, a major virulence factor involved in caseous lymphadenitis affecting mainly sheep, goats, and horses  <cit> . recently, further putative virulence factors were identified in c. ulcerans including neuraminidase h, endoglycosidase e, subunits of adhesive pili and a gene coding for a putative ribosome-binding protein with striking structural similarity to shiga toxins  <cit> .

while c. diphtheriae carriage is nearly exclusively restricted to humans, toxigenic c. ulcerans are zoonotic pathogens and have been found in various animal species with contact to humans such as livestock as well as companion and laboratory animals including cows with mastitis  <cit> , a goat with meningoencephalitis  <cit> , an asymptomatic farm pig linked to a human case of diphtheria  <cit> , macaques with mastitis or respiratory disease  <cit>  or without symptoms  <cit> , ferrets with infection derived from cephalic implants  <cit> , pet dogs and cats displaying nasal discharge  <cit>  and asymptomatic shelter dogs  <cit> .

a number of studies have also outlined c. ulcerans isolations from wild, exotic and zoo animal species such as wild boars and a roe deer with abscess formation in germany  <cit> , richardson ground squirrels with gangrenous dermatitis in canada  <cit> , two otters from uk  <cit> , two killer whales and a lion from the same zoo in japan  <cit>  and a dromedary camel with purulent lymphadenitis  <cit> . investigations on the toxicity with respect to dt were infrequently carried out, but some of the former isolates were toxigenic  <cit>  or non-toxigenic tox-bearing  strains  <cit> , the latter being a phenotype originally described for c. diphtheriae strains  <cit>  and recently also seen in c. ulcerans  <cit> . in recent years, diphtheria and diphtheria-like infections with toxigenic c. ulcerans have outnumbered those caused by toxigenic c. diphtheriae in many industrialized countries  <cit> . in contrast to c. diphtheriae-caused disease in humans, most human c. ulcerans diphtheria cases are associated with animal contact  <cit> . since c. ulcerans has been increasingly isolated as an emerging zoonotic agent of diphtheria and other infections from different animal species, the aim of this study was the comprehensive characterization of ten c. ulcerans isolations from a yet undescribed host species, which caused significant morbidity within the same group of zoo animals.

RESULTS
gross pathology and histopathology
postmortem examinations were performed on cases no. i and vii. the adult male water rats were in poor body condition. both animals showed multiple to coalescing deep cutaneous ulcers with irregular lateral margins in the caudal area of the dorsum measuring up to  <dig> × 10 cm .figure  <dig>

microscopic examination of the skin lesions of both rats revealed severe ulceration with extensive necrosuppurative dermatitis extending deeply into the subcutis and partially even underlying skeletal muscles with numerous intralesional colonies of bacilli as well as fragments of plant material and hair. using grocott methenamine silver  or ziehl-neelsen  stain or periodic acid schiff  reaction neither fungal organisms nor acid fast bacilli could be detected.

bacterial isolates
in total ten isolates of c. ulcerans could be cultivated from eight water rats from the same group . the bacteria grew after 24 hours on columbia blood agar as whitish, chalk-like colonies, approximately  <dig> - <dig>  mm in diameter and mostly in moderate to high numbers from skin swabs, which were taken from infected ulcers. in animal no. i, c. ulcerans could be isolated from all organs in high numbers. the growth characteristics were consistent with coryneform bacteria  <cit> . no growth was observed on gassner agar. after prolonged incubation for an additional 24 hours the irregular, dry colonies reached a size of 1–2 mm in diameter, surrounded by a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis. gram staining revealed regular gram-positive coccobacilli. all isolates displayed the reverse camp phenomenon with staphylococcus aureus and a regular camp reaction with rhodococcus equi, thus indicating phospholipase d activity  <cit> .table  <dig>

antimicrobial susceptibility testing
all c. ulcerans isolates were in vitro susceptible  to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid , ampicillin , apramycin , cefquinome , ceftiofur , cephalothin , enrofloxacin , erythromycin , florfenicol , gentamicin , neomycin , penicillin g , trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazol , and tiamulin . a resistant phenotype was recorded for clindamycin , colistin , and spectinomycin . six and four isolates were susceptible  and resistant  to tetracycline, respectively and four and six isolates showed intermediate susceptibility  and resistance  to tilmicosin, respectively. for tests showing varying results see table  <dig> 

matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry 
using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and the biotyper database all ten isolates were identified to the species level as c. ulcerans with a score level between  <dig>  and  <dig> , using the direct smear method in sample preparation. furthermore, identification of the concomitant bacterial flora comprising escherichia coli, buttiauxella agrestis, proteus spp., aeromonas spp., alcaligenes faecalis, acinetobacter johnsonii, streptococcus dysgalactiae, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens was also carried out by maldi-tof ms.

fourier transformation-infrared spectroscopy 
the comparison of the infrared -spectra of the ten isolates from water rats with a collection of field and reference strains showed a clear separation in two main branches for the closely related species c. diphtheriae and c. ulcerans . inside the c. ulcerans branch all isolates from water rats cluster compactly together, closely adjacent to a group of spectra formed by the reference strains which were isolated from human sources. a group of c. ulcerans from game animals could also be distinguished by ft-ir  <cit>  and clustered distant from the human and rat c. ulcerans.figure  <dig> 
cluster analysis of respective spectra obtained by fourier-transform infrared-spectroscopy  using opus software . in each case two ir-spectra of isolates from water rats and a selection of several c. ulcerans and c. diphtheriae strains were used for calculation with ward’s algorithm. the dendrogram obtained depicts the arrangement of isolates in groups according to their spectral differences.

rpob analysis
khamis et al.  <cit>  have shown that the gene for the rna polymerase beta subunit  features a better degree of variability for the identification of corynebacterium species than commonly used 16s rrna sequences. hence rpob was analysed for all ten new isolates as the fragment was already sequenced during multilocus sequence typing  analysis. all isolates showed no difference in partial rpob sequences . a rpob sequence-based phylogenetic analysis of the isolates obtained from water rats as well as from humans and game animals is depicted in figure  <dig>  isolates from water rats cluster together with dt-negative human strain ccm  <dig> but distantly to all dt-negative strains from game animals and apart from human dt-positive strains ccm  <dig> and cip  <dig> figure  <dig>

mlst analysis
all isolates from water rats had the same allele type in six housekeeping genes. for leua amplicons of only four isolates were obtained but these were also identical. none of the allele types observed corresponded to previously published types of c. diphtheriae strains . two clusters were discernible in a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of five housekeeping genes of c. ulcerans strains of different sources . the rat isolates, represented by isolate  <dig>  grouped together with human isolates and with an isolate from a dog, while the game animal isolates were clearly separated, forming their own cluster.figure  <dig>

discussion
within the genus corynebacterium the c. diphtheriae group is the most relevant concerning pathogenicity and public health impact  <cit> . with respect to its zoonotic potential c. ulcerans is one of the most important members of the genus and was referred to as an emerging pathogen  <cit> . numerous reports state zoonotic potential by contact with companion or farm animals  <cit> , but proven transmission of a toxigenic c. ulcerans strain between an animal and a human by isolation of an identical toxigenic c. ulcerans strain from an animal and a human contact person is documented only in four reported cases involving two dogs  <cit> , a cat  <cit>  and a pig  <cit> , respectively. during outbreaks in animal collections c. ulcerans isolates have so far never been subjected to detailed analysis, nor have they been tested for their relatedness. we have recently demonstrated a considerable homology between strains from game animals from different localities in germany  <cit> . according to mlst data c. diphtheriae with its currently  <dig> sequence types  is a weakly clonal species, while the population structure of c. ulcerans is widely unknown. for this study an existing mlst scheme for c. diphtheriae  <cit>  was adapted with good success, in that all seven allelic loci gave reasonable results also for c. ulcerans. a significant advantage of this method is that the data produced are portable, reproducible, and unambiguous compared to other methods for strain discrimination   <cit> . the mlst data indicate a very close relationship of the isolates suggesting spread of a clonally-related lineage. the question of origin of this isolate, whether it originated from animals in close proximity or whether it has been introduced by zookeepers of the zoological garden requires further investigations. a phylogenetic tree based on housekeeping genes obtained from available whole genomes places the rat isolates in closer proximity to human than to game animal isolates. on the other hand, the assessment of rpob sequences reveals major grouping effects between dt-negative and dt-positive c. ulcerans strains in particular . whether this reflects a common phylogeny of c. ulcerans strains from humans and water rats needs to be further determined using a broader collection of isolates.

concerning rodent host species and clinical symptoms this report bears remarkable analogies to an outbreak among  <dig> squirrels from canada which were captured within the city of calgary;  <dig> of them developed dermatitis, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis or septicemia, respectively, when held together in cages within a research facility  <cit> . as in the case presented here, cutaneous lesions were associated with bite injuries transmitted by asymptomatically infected carrier cage mates and were most likely caused by seasonal group hierarchical fighting. unfortunately, no toxicity testing was performed on the outbreak strain from the squirrels. c. ulcerans was also isolated from bite injuries, abscesses and pneumonic lung tissue in primates and injection of these isolates led to deep ulcers and necrotic abscesses in guinea pigs as another rodent species  <cit> . in humans, reported cases of cutaneous diphtheria by toxigenic c. ulcerans or c. diphtheriae by far outnumber those rare cases of skin infections through non-toxigenic c. ulcerans strains  <cit> , nevertheless, they do occur  <cit> . there is no information available concerning the zoonotic potential of c. ulcerans isolated from water rats. all ten isolates in our study turned out to be non-toxigenic. recent studies have shown additional virulence factors in c. ulcerans besides dt and phospholipase d  <cit> . human diphtheria can also be attributed to the emergence of non-toxigenic strains causing atypical disease  <cit> . strains, which produce only phospholipase d but not dt are also capable to cause severe systemic disease in humans, such as pneumonia and granulomatous nodules in the respiratory tract  <cit> . all isolates from this study were highly similar with respect to their antimicrobial pattern and showed at least partial resistance to clindamycin, colistin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and tilmicosin in vitro. albeit clindamycin was successfully used to treat animal infection  <cit> , resistance to this antimicrobial substance was noted for several human strains of c. ulcerans which were in some cases also resistant to erythromycin  <cit>  and levofloxacin  <cit> . one report states oxacillin-resistance in an isolate, which also proved to be clindamycin sensitive  <cit> . four of the here investigated ten isolates were resistant to tetracycline.

as also shown in previous studies, biochemical differentiation between c. ulcerans and c. pseudotuberculosis can be problematic  <cit> . basic conventional tests might be less discriminating between the two species  <cit> . furthermore, they are generally difficult to standardize, thus they may lead to varying and less comparable results. by use of the standardized systems api coryne and vitek2-compact all ten isolates from water rats could be correctly identified as c. ulcerans. we have shown recently, that these commercial biochemical test systems were insufficient for the unequivocal identification of c. ulcerans isolates from game animals  <cit> . in contrast, maldi-tof ms has been recently proven to differentiate both, potentially toxigenic corynebacterium species and coryneform bacteria  <cit> , and this was also true for this study. in addition, we demonstrate that ft-ir can also clearly identify c. ulcerans at species level, showing a high degree of spectral relatedness of the isolates under study. since partial rpob sequencing is more discriminatory when compared to 16s rdna sequencing, a cutoff value of ≤95% similarity proved suitable for species identification within corynebacteria  <cit>  and also clearly enabled species identification in the here described isolates. as suggested from earlier studies  <cit>  comparison of partial rpob gene sequences confirmed a close relationship of all ten isolates in this study, since no variations in these sequences were found.

CONCLUSIONS
we have documented ten c. ulcerans isolates from a yet unknown rodent host species. for correct understanding of epidemiology and to unequivocally determine the involved pathogen correctly to species level, commercial biochemical tests and additional approved methods like ft-ir, maldi-tof ms and rpob sequencing were sufficient to prove the c. ulcerans infection. furthermore, the latter methods and also mlst demonstrated a very close relationship between all ten isolates. future studies should include further c. ulcerans isolates from wildlife in virulence profiling and in phylogenetic typing to fully understand their properties and possible zoonotic consequences.
