BACKGROUND
in the last decade, model plants have been the subject of rapid advances in genomics, including the completion of the sequence of both arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  and rice  <cit> . knowledge gained from these studies and associated technological and methodological progresses create new prospects in a variety of biological fields, including functional and evolutionary genetics. this simultaneously renews our interest in naturally occurring variation. genomic approaches to the study of natural variation should increase our ability to understand gene function  <cit> , while the availability of sequence data from genome-wide marker loci can provide new insights into the major historical and selective factors shaping the genetic diversity of a species  <cit> . such new prospects for plant natural variation will only be met if carefully constructed samples of genotypes are used for characterizing patterns of naturally occurring variation. this revives interest in analyzing material currently available in germplasm collections. nearly a century has been spent collecting and preserving genetic diversity in plants, resulting in worldwide collections, currently stored in international networks of seed banks  <cit> . the large size of most of these collections however restricts the characterization of the material available, and hinders their successful use.

to "unlock" the genetic potential of these large collections, a general proposal is to construct smaller "core-collections", i.e. sub-samples of accessions chosen to represent the bulk of the genetic diversity contained in the larger collection. different sampling strategies have been proposed. genetic markers can be used to characterize the genetic variation present in the collection. such knowledge can lead to significant gains in the number of alleles retained in a sample compared to random sampling. first, the observed dna profiles can be used to determine the genetic uniqueness of each accession relative to all others and to reduce redundancies in the collection. second, analysis of single or multilocus genotypes allows inference of genetic ancestry among accessions. a model-based clustering algorithm that identifies groups with distinct allele frequencies  <cit>  can then be used to stratify the collection into a series of groups, even without prior information about the sampling locations of individuals. subsequently, core collections can be established by stratified sampling from the different groups  <cit> . an alternative way to use molecular information for sampling is to use marker gene data as a way to score the allelic richness of a sample. this approach, known as the maximization strategy, or hereafter m strategy, chooses the specific combination of accessions that maximizes the total allelic richness at available marker loci  <cit> . simulations showed that the efficiency of this method is expected to increase with increasing selfing rate and reduced gene flow in the studied species  <cit> . these predictions were recently validated using data from arabidopsis thaliana and, although the gain in diversity was rather modest  <cit> , the m strategy was used to build a set of nested core collections that can be used as a "gateway" to explore naturally occurring diversity in this species.

medicago truncatula recently emerged as a model species for the analysis of development during microbial interactions and other aspects of legume genetics and genomics  <cit> . key attributes of this species include its small, diploid genome , its self-fertile nature and its prolific seed production. researchers are developing tools and methods for molecular and genetic analysis  <cit> , and an international consortium is currently sequencing the "gene space" of medicago truncatula  <cit> . through the use of forward genetic strategies, these resources have already enabled the identification of a number of new genes that participate in the recognition of microbial and mycchorizal symbionts  <cit> . until now, most studies in medicago truncatula have focused on either a single reference individual or a limited number of populations  <cit> , with the exception of one recent study of  <dig> accessions  <cit> . in the present paper, we use a set of  <dig> microsatellite markers to survey the genetic diversity occurring in a sample consisting of  <dig> inbred lines spanning the bulk of the diversity that has been collected throughout the species range to date . first, we aimed to quantify the neutral genetic diversity available in this collection and to test for the presence of an underlying genetic structure in this broad sample. in a second step, results from these analyses are used to generate a set of nested core-collections for medicago truncatula. this subset of inbred lines represents the bulk of the diversity segregating in m. truncatula collected so far and is publicly available. these core collections will help organize and coordinate current efforts in the medicago truncatula community to study patterns of variation at both the phenotypic and the molecular levels.

RESULTS
microsatellite diversity
a summary of the microsatellite polymorphism uncovered is presented in table  <dig>  the average number of alleles per locus was na =  <dig>  but dropped to  <dig>  when removing rare alleles . averaged over loci, the gene diversity was he =  <dig>  with large variation among loci . rare heterozygote genotypes were found for each of the studied loci  but were dispersed across individuals . among the  <dig> pairs of loci,  <dig> were found to be in significant linkage disequilibrium . these pairs involved all the loci studied except the two less variable ones  which were in linkage equilibrium with all the other loci. locus mtpg85c contributed to  <dig> of the  <dig> statistically associated pairs of loci. combining data from the  <dig> microsatellite loci, we found  <dig> different multilocus profiles, thereby confirming the genetic uniqueness of each inbred line in our sample.

genetic structure of the collection
spatial autocorrelation analyses conducted over the whole sample revealed a weak signal of isolation by distance. positive and significant associations between kinship coefficients and geographic proximities were found only for individuals originating from the same location  and between neighbouring populations. similar analyses were conducted within two well-represented geographic regions: spain and algeria. kinship coefficients were of the same order of magnitude and we did not find any clear evidence for isolation by distance even at this restricted spatial scale .

we tested for the existence of a broad genetic stratification in our sample, consisting in k underlying genetically diverged groups , using microsatellite data and the model based clustering algorithm implemented in the software structure . to do so, we built a subsample of  <dig> accessions representing each sampled location by a single  inbred line. despite its smaller size compared to the initial sample, this subset exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity: mean na =  <dig> , mean he =  <dig>  . the pattern of linkage disequilibrium among loci was also conserved, with  <dig> out of  <dig> possible pairs of loci showing statistically significant associations . inspecting the gain in likelihood of the data  when modeling the data using an increasing number of underlying clusters  yielded clear support for the existence of a genetic structure in our sample. consistent estimates of log likelihood of the data across independent runs were obtained, with a slight variation between runs for k =  <dig>  posterior probabilities of the data always increased with increasing subdivision; the highest gain occurred between k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> and we found an inconspicuous plateau between k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> . independent runs produced highly consistent results for all k values except for k =  <dig> and k =  <dig> which yielded more than  <dig> inbred lines displaying inconsistent assignation between runs .

at k =  <dig>  the inferred structure was totally stable across runs and geographically consistent, isolating a set of  <dig> accessions originating from the south of spain and from morocco . this stratification accounted for  <dig> %  of the total genetic variance. at k =  <dig>  independent runs were less consistent, splitting roughly the largest cluster obtained at k =  <dig> in two groups, one being mainly represented by algerian accessions. at k =  <dig>  approximately 65% of the accessions showed a proportion of membership higher than  <dig>  into a group. plotting these "well-assigned" accessions on a geographic map showed that the clusters corresponded largely to major geographic regions . one cluster corresponded to the cluster already observed at k =  <dig>  i.e. grouping populations from spain and morocco . another cluster consisted largely of individuals collected in the south of france  while the two last groups distinguished the north-eastern  and the south-eastern of the mediterranean basin . plotting accessions with low partial membership  blurred this geographic stratification .

for k >  <dig>  each increase in k split one of the clusters obtained at previous k values. however, although the posterior probability of the data slightly increased with increasing k value, the mean proportion of membership into the inferred clusters jointly decreased, with more and more accessions showing a maximum membership into a group lower than  <dig> . this result combined with the plateau observed at k =  <dig> lead us to consider that the stratification observed at k =  <dig> was probably the most genuine one. the highest probability run observed at k =  <dig> was consequently used to define the different clusters. finally, re-running the clustering procedure on the  <dig> accessions and using the predefined population structure as 'prior information', we assigned the  <dig> supplementary accessions into these four clusters . although most of these accessions showed partial membership in multiple clusters,  <dig> out of the  <dig> accessions were assigned to the same cluster as other accessions originating from the same population. after this last step, the four clusters inferred were composed of respectively  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> accessions. the cultivars cyprus, caliph and paraggio were assigned to the north-eastern group . cultivars borung, mogul and sephi were assigned to the south-eastern group  while jemalong was assigned to the spanish-moroccan group .

analyzing patterns of genetic diversity within this stratification showed that the levels of genetic diversity is relatively homogeneous across clusters, each group exhibiting approximately the same level of genetic variation, as measured by he or na . compared to the whole sample, the four clusters showed lower proportions of significant pairwise linkage disequilibrium, with a maximum of  <dig> pairs of loci in ld for the smaller group . between clusters pairwise fst estimates varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> , the largest fst values were found in all pairwise comparisons involving cluster  <dig> ; the lowest values being observed between the northern and the southern clusters .

sampling of core-collections
we first studied the performance of two marker based strategies; the m and the h strategies  to build core collections by sampling our total data set of  <dig> genetically unique inbred lines. the performance of these two sampling strategies for assembling core collection was studied over a range of putative core collection  sizes. for each sample size, the performance of each strategy  was compared to a pure random strategy by comparing the average score of 30– <dig> core collections sampled independently. when evaluating the m strategy, we used  <dig> loci as markers to implement the m strategy and we used the remaining  <dig> loci as targets to cross validate the efficacy of the m strategy. such procedure allowed us to test whether the m strategy can assemble core collection displaying high allelic diversity not only at the set of markers used to implement it but also throughout the genome. not surprisingly the score of core collections built using the m strategy was much better than pure random sampling when considering marker loci only . however, when considering a set of  <dig> loci not used by the m strategy, the score of core collections built by the m strategy was only slightly better than the score of core collections sampled purely at random . this finding suggests that relatively modest gains in allelic diversity are to be expected when building core collection using the m strategy relative to a pure random sampling of the collection. similarly we compared the score of core collections built using the h strategy with purely random core collection of the same size. the average score of the h strategy was consistently better than a pure random sampling but the difference in score was nevertheless very small .

a set of nested core collections were assembled to represent the bulk of the diversity contained in our collection of  <dig> genotypes. these core collections were composed of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> individuals and are denoted as cc <dig>  cc <dig>  ..., cc <dig> . given the performances of the m and the h strategies, we finally used a "hybrid/mixed" strategy to assemble these collections. for each core size, we gave equal weight to each of the four clusters uncovered in the structure analysis. within each cluster, we used the m strategy to build a core collection of c individuals. given that a number of important inbred lines  were found in all four clusters inferred when stratifying our collection in k =  <dig> groups, we chose to retain these  <dig> genotypes as our starting cc <dig> collection. for all subsequent core collections , the m strategy was implemented within each of the four groups and constrained to include the individuals comprising the "previous" core collections. this yielded a set of nested core collections whose detailed composition is provided to help design further studies . the allelic richness of each core collection is displayed figure  <dig> 

discussion
microsatellite variation in medicago truncatula
surveying a worldwide collection of individuals for a set of  <dig> microsatellite loci distributed throughout the genome, we revealed a large amount of genetic variability in medicago truncatula. this result was expected considering the sampling scale and the class of markers we used. microsatellite markers are known to display high mutation rates, and are thus expected to reveal fairly high amounts of polymorphisms especially when used at the species level  <cit> . we found however a large variation among loci for both the gene diversity  and the allelic numbers, with two loci exhibiting less than  <dig> alleles over the whole sample. comparisons with other annual selfing plant species are not straightforward as we used a large sample size spanning a wide geographic range. a survey of arabidopsis thaliana conducted at a broad geographic scale over  <dig> individuals reported a similar range of values for he   <cit> . this range is similar to the range found here when excluding the three loci exhibiting markedly reduced levels of polymorphism . mtic <dig> and mtic <dig> were based on est sequences. this could explain their lower polymorphism compared to other loci located in less constrained intergenic regions

multilocus level analyses revealed no redundancy within the collection, so we used all the individuals for further analyses. the sample we used spans different spatial scales: the population level, different geographical regions and the whole species. a hierarchical analysis would thus appear appropriate to determine how genetic diversity is organized within and between populations. such an analysis was however not suitable because the within population sampling scheme was not random: sampling was based on prior information on allozyme genotypes and was performed to maximize the within population diversity. in medicago truncatula, the fine-scale population structure has already been documented. from these studies, we know that within population diversity in medicago truncatula is highly variable among populations .

previous hierarchical population genetic analyses also revealed that pairs of populations are highly differentiated even at a small spatial scale . in accordance with these results, the present study was able to demonstrate a spatial genetic correlation only for individuals originating from the same population or from very adjacent populations. the occurrence of spatial correlation over short distances can be interpreted as the result of current low distance migration/drift processes. for a selfing species, most dispersion should occur through seed dispersal. in medicago truncatula, short distance seed dispersal can occur  but the fruits bear spikes which facilitate dispersal by animals  potentially over longer distances. moreover, m. truncatula is often confined to marginal agricultural habitats, and thus undergo rapid population turnover. this type of so called metapopulation dynamics is expected to increase genetic drift at the population level. these factors are expected to generate highly differentiated populations with neighbouring locations showing as much differentiation as much more distant one as we observed here. this configuration, combined with the sampling scheme adopted in our survey, could also explain the low level of linkage disequilibrium observed in the whole sample  <cit> . ostrowski and collaborators  <cit>  also recently reported a similar finding in a broad sample of arabidopsis thaliana accessions.

inferred population structure in medicago truncatula
although we could not find isolation by distance over large geographic distances, the model-based clustering algorithm we used revealed patterns of population structure that were roughly consistent with the geographic origin of the accessions. this consistency was striking when considering accessions with a high proportion of membership in one of the inferred clusters. accessions with partial membership  shuffled the tight correspondence between genetic ancestry and regional affiliation. these accessions represented roughly 30% of the sample, and probably signed recent events of gene-flow between neighbouring groups or a mixture of large distance dispersal and recombination events. the population structure inferred at k =  <dig> was retained as the most consistent stratification because high proportions of individuals with partial membership  were found for higher k values . this stratification accounted for 8% of the microsatellite genetic variation observed over the whole sample, and, as expected from the clustering algorithm we used, the within cluster levels of linkage disequilibrium were low compared to the whole sample. we note that caution must be exerted when interpreting the biological significance of this stratification. in particular the number of inferred clusters should not be taken at face value as it reflects the underlying true genetic structure, which may be discrete or continuous, its sampling and the amount of marker information available for inference  <cit> . with that in mind, we discuss below the most salient features of the structure we uncovered.

the cluster showing the highest geographic consistency corresponded to a restricted geographic area: the iberian peninsula and morocco. interestingly, this cluster was already identified at k =  <dig> and subsequently displayed the highest level of differentiation with the three other clusters . this cluster was also clearly differentiated from both france and algeria. together, these results provide compelling support for the previous hypothesis of a refuge during glacial cycles in this region  <cit> . iberia has been shown to be one of the three main european refugia for most plant species along with italy and the balkans  <cit> . for the remaining accessions, the stratification uncovered at k =  <dig> clearly distinguished the north and the south of the mediterranean basin. this result suggests a colonization of the mediterranean via two routes from an initial area located around the middle east. the low level of differentiation observed between these two groups  however can also be interpreted as the result of a recent expansion of the species around the mediterranean.

performance of core collection sampling strategies
when benchmarking the h and m strategies against a pure random strategy, we found very little gain when scoring genetic diversity at loci not involved in the sampling . this suggests that the h and m strategies are not very likely to perform better than a pure random sampling. this finding may be surprising given that the mating system of m. truncatula  and the patterns of regional subdivision uncovered in our sample are factors that a priori favor marker assisted sampling strategies over pure random sampling to capture efficiently variation  <cit> . one particular property of our sample may however explain this finding. the set of inbred lines to which we applied these sampling strategies were highly non redundant to start with. in fact, for all populations coming from the inra collection that make up 2/ <dig> of our sample, the strategy used to extract inbred lines from populations did take into account the amount of polymorphism detected within populations. this strategy ensured for instance that populations which displayed relatively higher levels of variation were represented by more inbred lines  than populations found to be monomorphic. thus the initial absence of redundancy in our sample of  <dig> inbred lines  together with overall low levels of linkage disequilibrium may leave little room for the optimized sampling of variation and may explain the poor gains of marker-assisted sampling strategies  over pure random sampling. another possibility is that more markers or markers with lower mutation rates may be needed to efficiently "tag" the genome. mckhann et al  <cit> , using only  <dig> gene anchored fragments  and snp variation present within those fragments to guide sampling observed some modest gain  of the m strategy over a pure random strategy.

CONCLUSIONS
we have extracted  <dig> genetically unique inbred lines from a large set of sampling locations representing the extent of natural variation collected to date throughout the species range of medicago truncatula. these inbred lines, a publicly available resource for the medicago community, were genotyped at  <dig> microsatellite loci. we used patterns of microsatellite diversity to uncover the presence of a broad scale genetic structure in m. truncatula. this stratification, the presence of  <dig> genetically diverged groups which were inferred solely on the basis of marker data, was found a posteriori to be consistent with the geographical origin of genotypes. pattern of microsatellite diversity and genetic structure in medicago truncatula were used to obtain some insight into the demographic history of this species and to build a set of nested core collection representing the breadth of naturally occurring genetic variation. these, nested core collections can be used as a standardized panel for coordinating efforts aimed at in depth characterization of phenotypic variation and efficient snps discovery in medicago truncatula. as such these nested core collections will be a pivotal resource for functional and evolutionary genomics studies in the growing medicago truncatula community. future work will document the extent of genetic divergence existing between this genepool, the related sub species m. truncatula ssp tricycla and the sister species medicago littoralis. this will yield a clearer picture of the phylogenetic relationships between these taxa and will allow identifying a set of accessions complementing our nested core collections.
