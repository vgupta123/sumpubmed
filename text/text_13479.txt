BACKGROUND
in humans, the number of unique immunoglobulin  and t-cell receptors  approaches  <dig> <cit> . much of this diversity is generated through the combinatorial assembly of antigen receptor genes from discrete dna segments by the process of vj recombination. aberrant vj recombination is one mechanism responsible for chromosomal translocations associated with lymphoid malignancies. characterization of canonical and aberrant vj rearrangements is fundamental to understanding the primary antigen receptor repertoire and the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. reflecting this interest and developments in sequencing technology, the international immunogenetics information system  blast database has increased in size from ~21 mb to ~63 mb of human sequence data since  <dig>  <cit> . even at this size, however, the database comprises only  <dig> functionally recombined human alleles and  <dig> non-functional alleles or pseudogenes.

identification of vj recombination products by next generation sequencing techniques is an attractive way to obtain a more comprehensive sample of the estimated repertoire  <cit> . however, sequence properties that define ig and tcr loci also make their interpretation from short read technology challenging. standard practices like removal of poorly aligned reads must be modified to accommodate the specific structural changes expected during vj recombination and the prevalence of regional segmental duplications. complexities associated with this task are well recognized  <cit> .

we have developed a targeted method to selectively sequence vj recombination events. it has the advantage of revealing off-target and non-canonical rearrangements that may be unexpressed or unamplifiable with primer pairs designed to detect canonical rearrangements. we demonstrate the method in a panel of primary lymphoid tumors and lymphoid cell lines and report high-resolution sequences comprising canonical and unknown, non-canonical rearrangements as well as two chromosome translocations mediated by erroneous vj recombination events. we expect that this approach will provide deeper insight into the role vj recombination plays in pathogenesis of lymphoproliferative disease.

RESULTS
experimental approach
genomic dna fragments were enriched for recombination signal sequences  using an rna bait hybridization based approach and subjected to paired-end illumina sequencing . total reads per sample ranged from 434 k to 797 k. reads were aligned to the reference genome assembly , and read pileups were seen within 1 kb intervals surrounding bait sequences. the most distant rearrangement observed and validated contained reads extending about 255 bp away from the edge of the nearest bait. between 83% and 94% of total reads aligned to the reference genome, and approximately 50% of these mapped to targeted regions .

repetitive sequences
ambiguous alignments  were frequently encountered. this reflects inherent properties of antigen receptor loci, which contain arrays of homologous gene segments at several genomic loci. baits and surrounding contexts were enriched for segmental duplications about 6-fold above the genome-wide level. where possible we resolved ambiguous alignments with sensitive realignment. we frequently could validate events within segmental duplications, provided the two junctional sequences were not homologous. of the  <dig> non-canonical events reported here,  <dig> were within segmental duplications, and of the  <dig> canonical events,  <dig> were within segmental duplications. a more detailed description of how we distinguished true structural variants from alignment artifacts over these intervals and an associated r package to aid in visualizing alternate alignments will be described in a companion paper .

canonical vj and v-j events
normal vj and v-j recombination juxtaposes coding sequences for immunoglobulin or t-cell receptor proteins by deletion or inversion of intervening gdna. we observed  <dig> canonical events in this study. we defined  <dig> of these at single base resolution using split-reads,  <dig> precisely defined rearrangements directly over coding sequence and  <dig> precisely defined at the rss-rss junctions created via inversion . the remaining  <dig> we inferred from paired read pileups only. of the  <dig> immunoglobulin events defined to the base,  <dig> were igk inversions and  <dig> were igh deletions. both igk inversions and  <dig> igh deletions were in-frame, productive rearrangements based upon the orf annotation of vj elements from ncbi and ensembl. the other  <dig> igh deletions were unproductive rearrangements,  <dig> out of frame and  <dig> in frame but containing only 35 bp of a 175 bp igk coding segment.

of the  <dig> canonical recombinations observed, half reflected immunoglobulin heavy chain  locus deletions. most of these were observed in a single ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid b-cell line , whereas no more than two rearranged igh alleles were seen in monoclonal b-cell proliferations . this is consistent with the reported oligoclonality of lymphoblastoid cells  <cit> . although we did not see recurrent use of any of the more numerous igh v or igh d segments, we did note repeated usage of j <dig> and j <dig> segments. this is not surprising given the relative numbers of each segment type. out of  <dig> igh d-j deletions in lcl, j <dig> was used  <dig> times and j <dig> was used once. out of  <dig> igh d-j deletions in the b-cell neoplasms, j <dig> was used once and j <dig> was used twice. our observations are congruent with previous reports indicating j <dig> and j <dig> over representation in multiple b cell contexts including peripheral b lymphocytes and b-all  <cit> .

 samples for which only canonical v-d-j recombination was observed. *the v-j rearrangement observed in the pre-b all is likely to be normal v-d-j, however we obtained full read alignments only for read pairs mapping one end to ighj <dig> and the other to ighv4- <dig>   samples for which only non-canonical events were observed. non-canonical events are indicated as italicized text.  samples for which both canonical and non-canonical events were observed.

the immunoglobulin kappa light chain locus  and the locus encoding t-cell receptor β chain  loci followed the same pattern, with recurrent utilization of j segments but not of the more numerous v segments  or v or d segments . the igk locus j <dig> and j <dig> rsss were recombined one time each in the lcl, out of  <dig> observed v-j joints, and once and  <dig> times in neoplastic b-cells, respectively, out of  <dig> observed v-j joints. use of trb j <dig> was observed in two of three t-cell neoplasms studied. we observed two events using the same variable segment  at the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus ; these were recombined with different j elements.

most  canonical, non-igh rearrangements detected were inversions. we attribute this to a bias of our method towards inversion detection. capturing inversional rearrangements, which retain rss sequences, is an expected outcome as probes were designed to hybridize rss sequences directly. deletional rearrangement detection, conversely, requires sequencing rearranged segments adjacent to a captured rss not participating in the rearrangement.

four of the inversion junctions observed represented signal joints and two represented coding joints. one coding joint resulted in a productive v-j allele  <cit> . the other coding joint resulted in a productive vj allele  <cit> . four of the  <dig> inversions occurred in a single sample,  <dig> in neoplastic b-cells, and  <dig> in a t cell neoplasm. the lcl sample exhibited  <dig> inversions, both at igk, one of these being the largest intra-chromosomal rearrangement observed . this larger inversion involved a >1 mb segment of 2p <dig>  bringing igkj <dig> and igkv1d- <dig> together.

all five canonical rearrangements in the igk locus were inversions, including one in a burkitt-like lymphoma using a j element <  <dig> kb centromeric of the t breakpoint seen on a different allele of the same sample . this event involved a  <dig> kb segment of 2p <dig> , bringing igkj <dig> together with igkv1d- <dig>  the t-cell inversion in loucy cells was the only inversional joining of v, d, and j segments that we observed . this rearrangement we infer occurred in  <dig> steps: a deletion bringing trbj2- <dig> into contact with an upstream d element in 7q <dig>  and the subsequent joining of the dj unit to trbv5- <dig> via inversion.

non-canonical and lineage inappropriate rearrangements
four non-canonical events were interstitial deletions bringing two v elements together: the rss of one v segment and the coding sequence of a second v segment. the rss of the invading v appeared to use a cryptic heptamer sequence within the removed v and at the signal end. this has previously been described as v replacement when it involves recombination between a germline v segment and a previously assembled vhdjh or vljl unit  <cit> . our method enabled observation of this phenomenon at both igh and igk loci and without prior rearrangement of the replaced v . three v-to-v events occurred within igh, all utilizing v4- <dig> with either v1- <dig> or v3-52; the remaining example occurred at igk. two of these events, one at igh and one at igk were seen in the lcl. we aligned split-reads and sanger sequences for these regions to the build of huref dna, and see no evidence that this was a germline or constitutional event. of the three v4- <dig> deletions, all appear to have occurred independently in the lymphoid lineage with unique insertions of n-region nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase . two occurred in tumor cell lines, arh- <dig> and db; in each case small portions of the coding segment between the centromeric rss and the cryptic heptamer were retained adjacent to n-region nucleotides at the junction.

of the other two non-canonical events, one was a lineage-inappropriate rearrangement, a v to d rearrangement via deletion at igh in loucy cells, which are derived from a precursor t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> . the other non-canonical recombination was a putative v-j rearrangement at trb in a chronic t-cell leukemia sample, apparently lacking the expected d element between the v and j . this event involved a  <dig> kb inversion in 7q <dig> rearranging trbj2- <dig> with trbv <dig>  we obtained sequence from the v rss to j rss junction but not the v-j segment junction, inferring that neither of the two trbd elements had recombined with j elements from the trbj <dig> cluster preceding the inversion, as this would have deleted the 12 bp spacer rss flanking trbj2- <dig> that we observed. the recombination did not violate the 12– <dig> recombination rule, but a d-j rearrangement should have preceded incorporation of the v segment  <cit> .

n-region nucleotides
we observed addition of n-region  nucleotides at all seven validated junctions involving at least one coding segment. these included  <dig> short additions between  <dig> and 5 bp across  <dig> samples,  <dig> in lcl,  <dig> in db cells, and  <dig> in loucy cells;  <dig> intermediate size additions of  <dig> and 11 bp both in db cells; and one long addition of 23 bp in arh- <dig>  the activity of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  enzyme can explain these additions, although the addition in arh- <dig> is unusually long. n regions were highly specific to coding segments and not seen at any of the  <dig> rss-rss junctions in which we obtained split-reads, including the five igk canonical inversions and the v to j rearrangement at trb in the chronic t-cell leukemia sample.

oncogenic interchromosomal translocations
in two samples, large numbers of reads mapped to loci on other chromosomes not targeted for sequencing, reflecting possible vj recombinase mediated translocations with breakpoints near rss. the first off-target sequences mapped on the telomeric side of the myc oncogene on chromosome  <dig> and occurred with partial read or read pairs mapping on the centromeric side of igkj <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  this was consistent with a t translocation. this lesion was observed in a pediatric patient who had been immunosuppressed after receiving an organ transplant, and is consistent with having contributed to the development of a burkitt-like lymphoma in this person. genomic dna from fresh frozen primary cells was used for our analysis.

upon investigation with split-reads, we determined junctional sequences for both der and der. the der breakpoint occurred 110 bp centromeric of igkj <dig> and 2603 bp telomeric of myc. the der breakpoint was 110 bp centromeric of igkj <dig> and 2855 bp telomeric of myc . these breakpoints indicated a 252 bp loss of sequence from der, and 317 bp loss from der. myc-igk translocations are not uncommon in burkitt lymphoma, occurring with a 5-10% frequency. numerous locations downstream of myc, even hundreds of kb away, have been reported as breakpoints in myc activating myc-igk translocations. pathologic features in our case are consistent with myc activation . myc-igk breakpoints near ours have been reported. in a recent report of breakpoints for  <dig> high-grade lymphoma samples with t, one patient sample and one cell line had der breakpoints between igkj <dig> and igkj <dig>  similar to our igk der breakpoint  <cit> . one patient sample in their cohort showed a 435 bp deletion from der, similar in size to our der deletion. one cell line from their cohort exhibited loss of sequence from both der and der, although shorter than what we observed .

the second interchromosomal translocation occurred in the db cell line, derived from a diffuse large b-cell lymphoma . the t is a common translocation for diffuse large b-cell lymphomas, occurring in about 20% of cases  <cit> . these resemble follicle center cells; expression of cd <dig>  which had been reported for this cell line, is consistent with that origin. we observed an unbalanced translocation with loss of  <dig>  bp from igh on der, between ighj <dig> and ighd5- <dig>  and loss of 12 bp from der,  <dig>  kb centromeric of bcl- <dig> . junctional sequences for both der and der contained n-regions,  <dig> on der and  <dig> on der. loss of sequence between the ighj and ighd loci on der has been previously reported in the dlbcl line, su-dhl- <dig>  as well as b cell lymphoma patient samples  <cit> . short junctional additions on der and der are also reported for su-dhl- <dig> 

previously described igh-bcl- <dig> translocation breakpoints in b-cell neoplasms are similar to ours but not exactly matching. we searched  <dig> databases to determine the novelty of our breakpoints; breaks within ighj <dig> are common and closely match ours, whereas the other breakpoints involved are less often seen and do not match as closely. in dbcrid: database of chromosomal rearrangements in disease, we found sequence at the breakpoints on der for  <dig> diffuse large b-cell lymphoma patient  <cit> . on the centromeric side, these clustered in a 22 bp window within ighj <dig>  approximately 600 bp centromeric to our breakpoint within ighj <dig>  <cit> . on the telomeric side, breakpoints clustered in a 50 bp window within the 3′ utr of bcl- <dig>  approximately  <dig>  kb telomeric of our breakpoint.

igh-bcl- <dig> translocation breakpoints closer to the ones we observed were found in a chromosomal rearrangement breakpoint database containing 551 t entries  <cit> . we found  <dig> exact matches to our der breakpoint on the centromeric side , both in non-malignant b cell samples. each had sequence additions at the breakpoints albeit different from ours. of follicular and diffuse large b cell lymphoma entries in the database,  <dig> had a breakpoint within 1kb of our der ighj <dig> breakpoint, with  <dig> matching within 5 bp. we did not find exact, or as nearly exact, breakpoint matches in the database for other t junctional sequences. for the der ighd5- <dig> breakpoint the nearest entry was 9 bp away for a non-malignant b cell sample and 1840 bp away for a b cell lymphoma. for our breakpoints centromeric of bcl- <dig>  the nearest entry, from a b cell lymphoma, was  <dig> and 695 bp away from our der and der breakpoints, respectively. in a pattern similar to dbcrid, 90% of bcl- <dig> breakpoints in the database were in the 3′ utr, the vast majority clustering in a 150 bp window. only 3% of bcl- <dig> breakpoints were further downstream of the gene than ours. nonetheless our der conformed in structure to the predominant der model from the database, whereby the ighj locus adjoins bcl- <dig>  coding sequence intact.

because the igh-bcl- <dig> translocation had not to our knowledge been reported previously in this cell line, we performed standard metaphase karyotyping analysis. seventeen metaphases were evaluated in this near tetraploid cell line. the cells showed the following composite, complex karyotype: 77 ~ 80 < 4n>, xxyy, - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  add, - <dig>  add, del, - <dig> + <dig>  der, - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  add, - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  add, - <dig>  t, - <dig>  - <dig>  dert, + <dig>  add, +mar <dig>  +mar <dig>  the abnormalities observed in the karyotype aside from t were not seen in the sequencing data as we had no baits covering these loci.

discussion
we have designed and implemented a method for interrogating vj segment rearrangement using a targeted, sequence-specific capture method combined with illumina sequencing. this method can detect non-canonical as well as canonical vj recombination, even within segmental duplications. we have also provided evidence for single base resolution at the breakpoints, as indicated by sanger sequencing validation of split-reads mappings . in aggregate, we report  <dig> non-canonical structural rearrangements across  <dig> samples, two of which have been previously reported, as well as  <dig> canonical rearrangements . excluding events within igh, most of the canonical arrangements were inversions, with kappa light chain v to j rearrangement predominating . this may reflect bias in our enrichment strategy, which placed baits for sequence recovery on signal joint sides of rsss. symmetric bait coverage surrounding rsss would be expected to mitigate this bias.

a relatively large portion of events was from the lcl sample. this is consistent with the oligoclonal or heterogeneous derivation of this cell line, which provides more opportunity to detect events than clonal, neoplastic cells. the finding suggests that sequence capture methods may be applied to mixed lymphoid populations, including oligoclonal proliferations in the context of disease or polyclonal populations at various stages of lymphoid development. understanding detection limits in populations of cells and applying the method to single cells are areas of future investigation.

for all junctional reads from coding segments, we observed n-region addition of nucleotides at the breakpoints, which we attribute to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  enzyme activity . we did not see this same addition for junctions overlapping only rss elements, with rss-rss junctions mapping exactly to the reference genome with no intervening, untemplated bases . most nucleotide additions adjacent to a coding segment were between  <dig> and  <dig> bases, although we observed  <dig> longer additions. for one of these exceptions, a recombination by interstitial deletion, we observed 23 n-region nucleotides that did not align to either side of the juxtaposed sequences . although this is an unusual length of nucleotides for tdt addition, it is unclear if dysregulated tdt activity is otherwise related to the proliferation.

we expect that inspection of vj recombination using high throughput sequencing will provide a more complete picture of rearrangement at antigen receptor loci. perhaps more importantly, next generation capture sequencing approaches such as ours may prove powerful in the study of how lymphoid populations change in response to antigenic selection or during clonal evolution of malignancies  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experience underscores the value of targeted methods, both in sequencing and in analytical approaches. first, we have optimized cost and output with a sequence-based targeted pull down method, enabling deep sequencing of selected regions while minimizing data generation and processing time. excellent coverage of desired sequences with effective exclusion of the remainder of the genome demonstrates the exquisite specificity of rss sequences for genomic dna capture. secondly, in analytical aspects, we have balanced throughput with accuracy and shown the utility of contextual inspections of ambiguous aligning sequences.

other methods of sequencing products of vj recombination, even those leveraging considerable sequencing throughput, frequently focus on expressed products present in rna/cdna fractions or products that are amplifiable from genomic dna sequences using primers anticipating canonical rearrangements of coding segments. our method has the advantage of independence from these. as such, it should prove especially useful for finding off target and non-canonical rearrangements, such as the vj recombinase-mediated chromosomal translocations and non-canonical v-v deletion events we described here. the latter example, which occurred with unexpected frequency in our small sample set, reflects a category of events that have not been well described outside of rearranged v-replacement. finally, this advantage of our approach may facilitate the detection of vj recombinase-mediated translocations in preneoplastic leukemia samples  <cit>  or the identification of transposition events  <cit>  in lymphocyte development and in lymphoid pathologies.
