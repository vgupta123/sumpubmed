BACKGROUND
genotyping of cultivars and breeding material using molecular markers is a very important tool for modern plant breeders. as a component of marker-assisted selection , molecular markers improve and accelerate the process of development and release of new cultivars  <cit> . molecular markers also facilitate unequivocal cultivar identification and resolution of potential ownership conflicts by elucidating the pedigree/ancestry of a given genotype. they are also used to investigate genetic distance and similarity within germplasm collections  <cit> .

single nucleotide polymorphism  markers are one of the most important types of molecular markers and there have been significant recent developments in this technology for cultivated bread wheat, triticum aestivum l.  <cit> . the initial development of snp markers was cumbersome and low-throughput, utilising est  <cit>  and bac sequencing information  <cit> . however, whole genome profiling  <cit>  through next-generation sequencing  platforms has greatly facilitated the development and deployment of snp platforms for plant breeding  <cit> , particularly for crops such as wheat  <cit> . the development of ngs technologies and associated data management tools for genotyping of allo-polyploid species  <cit>  has been critical for bread wheat, a species with a very large genome and three sets of homoeologous chromosomes: aa, bb and dd  <cit> . three general types of ngs-snp technologies for wheat genotyping have been exploited  <cit> . the simplex technology is commonly deployed with a taqman assay for genotyping a single snp amongst multiple samples  <cit> . multiplex genotyping methods are suitable for studying a larger number of snp markers  across a limited numbers of samples, typically fewer than several hundred  <cit> . in our study we selected a third, array-based technology that can assay thousands of snp markers across the genome. we used an infinium 9 k snp array  <cit>  to investigate the genetic diversity amongst a small panel of bread wheats from kazakhstan to access the relationship between kazakh wheats and elite lines from other regions. similar strategies for snp genotyping have also been used for durum wheat  <cit> , emmer wheat  <cit> , synthetic wheat and their wild progenitors  <cit> .

snp genotypes have been useful for both linkage and association mapping approaches to associate markers with agronomic traits. using kaspar technology, high density snp genetic maps have been established for doubled-haploid populations  <cit>  and for sorted chromosome 3b  <cit> . genetic relationships were studied in  <dig> european winter bread wheat lines, although only  <dig> of  <dig>  high quality snp markers were found to be suitable for use in association mapping  <cit> .

further modifications of ngs-snp technology were developed and applied to the study of genetic diversity in durum wheat. single strand conformation polymorphism  and kaspar technology were exploited for fine mapping ‘gene of interest’ in durum wheat lines with bulked segregant analysis  <cit> . sequence related amplified polymorphism  markers and genotyping-by-sequencing  technologies were successfully used for genotyping wheat germplasm, cultivars and mapping populations  <cit> . in diploid species aegilops tauschii, the progenitor of the wheat d genome, 7 k - 185 k polymorphic and high-confidence snp markers were reported and used for studying of the genome evolution, genetic diversity and geographic origin of various accessions  <cit> . bioinformatics databases including cerealsdb and snpmeta provide publicly accessible data on ngs-snp, gbs and kaspar technology  <cit> .

the aims of the current study were:  assess the suitability of the snp platforms to explore the origins and basis of selection for relatively isolated wheat improvement programs using kazakhstan as a model;  identify polymorphic and unique snp markers and examine their distribution across the genome and chromosomes of a set of ten bread wheat cultivars from kazakhstan, including eight cultivars recently bred and two historical reference-pedigree cultivars; and  assess intra- and inter-varietal genetic diversity among the selected cultivars to explore the origins of key kazakh wheat lines. this initial study can be used as a basis for further a more extensive germplasm study and to develop a set of snp markers useful for breeding programs in kazakhstan.

eight cultivars are derived from recent breeding programs in kazakhstan along with two historical reference-pedigree cultivars . pedigree information is extracted from publications and databases  <cit> .



selection of wheat accessions with published data for phylogenetic comparison
a small panel of wheats of wide geographic origin was selected from  <dig>  wheat accessions with published data  <cit>  for their comparison with studied cultivars from kazakhstan. genetically diverse accessions were selected from: asia , australia , canada , china  and usa  . all accessions were spring wheat cultivars, with the exception of two landraces from uzbekistan. the panel was used for phylogenetic comparison with the ten cultivars from kazakhstan used in this study.

dna extraction and 9 k infinium snp marker analysis
plants were grown in a greenhouse until tillering and five uniform plants were selected for each cultivar, with the exception of cultivar tze-3c, where six plants were chosen. dna was extracted from a single young leaf from each plant, using a phenol-chloroform extraction method  <cit> . dna concentration was adjusted to 50 ng μl− <dig> and the quality of dna was checked both by gel electrophoresis and with pcr. dna samples  were submitted to the department of primary industries , victoria  for genotyping using the 9 k infinium snp array  <cit>  with details presented in additional file  <dig> 

all snp markers were assessed and polymorphic markers were identified where alleles differed in at least one cultivar. unique snp markers were distinguished from the polymorphic ones, defined as being diagnostic for a single cultivar . additionally, clusters of three or more unique markers, which mapped to small regions of a single chromosome on the consensus map , were defined and identified for each cultivar. unique snp markers with identical locations on the genetic map were counted as a single marker when identifying snp marker clusters. all unique snp markers and their clusters were assessed and checked manually. markers, which were polymorphic among the 5– <dig> plants within a given cultivar were classified as ‘intra-varietal’, and not used for ‘inter-varietal’ analysis.

computer map imaging and molecular phylogeny
the computer software program flapjack  <cit>  was used for graphical genotyping and visualization of the genetic map for all samples and to indicate the positions of snp markers with known chromosome locations. a similarity matrix exported from flapjack and from table of snp markers  <cit>  was converted into a distance matrix, which was then applied to construct a bionj trees  <cit>  using splitstree <dig> program  <cit> . nei’s gene diversity and polymorphism information content  were calculated using powermarker, version  <dig>   <cit> . nei’s gene diversity determines the probability that two randomly selected alleles are different among samples. pic indicates the probability that two randomly selected samples will show polymorphic alleles. mapchart, version  <dig> , was used for the preparation and visualization of a genetic map  <cit> .

RESULTS
distribution of polymorphic snp markers on wheat genomes and chromosome groups
the 9 k infinium snp analysis identified  <dig>  snp markers, of which  <dig>  were effective across the ten kazakh wheat cultivars. the data set supporting the results of this article is included in additional file  <dig>  nei’s gene diversity was very high but relatively similar between the cultivars, ranging from  <dig>   to  <dig>  , and pic values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

however, only  <dig>  of the polymorphic snp markers  could be mapped to a chromosome location in wheat and used for further study . these markers were distributed almost equally across the a and b genomes , while approximately 10-fold fewer snp markers were mapped in the d genome. the distribution of snp markers across homeologous chromosome was not highly variable and ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp markers.table  <dig>

the distribution of the unique snp markers was disproportional between the studied cultivars. more than half  were specific to the old, reference-pedigree cultivar ery- <dig>  indicating that this genotype was the most genetically distinct from the other wheat cultivars. the second and third most genetically distinctive cultivars were kaz- <dig> and akt- <dig>  possessing  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, of the total number of identified unique snp markers. the least genetic polymorphism was found in two cultivars, kaz-r and pav- <dig>  associated with only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of unique snp markers, respectively .

distribution of clusters of unique snp markers across chromosomes
the distribution of the unique snp markers mapped to individual chromosomes was specific for each cultivar. all chromosomes were covered by unique snps but their distribution frequencies were different. in contrast to individual unique snp markers, clusters of three or more closely mapped markers were identified for each cultivar, and their distribution patterns were more specific and could be used to characterize the studied germplasm . clusters of unique snp markers may represent segments of the wheat chromosomes introgressed from exotic ancestral germplasm. such clusters of unique snp markers are diagnostic due to their presence in only one cultivar. almost all groups of three or more snp markers listed in table  <dig> were mapped to small chromosomal regions and could thus be defined as clusters, with the exception of only a few snps, dispersed along the chromosomes in different cultivars. the most diverse cultivar ery- <dig>  with the highest number of unique snp markers, also had  <dig> clusters of unique snps covering almost all chromosomes. ery- <dig> is not shown in figure  <dig> because of the extensive diversity found in this cultivar. the next two most diverse cultivars, in terms of unique snps , had  <dig> and  <dig> clusters of unique snp markers, respectively, spread across genomes and chromosomes . importantly, clusters of unique snp markers were distributed very specifically for each of the studied genotypes. for example, single clusters of unique snp markers were found in pav- <dig> and kaz-r on chromosomes 3as and 3bl, respectively, while two clusters were found in tze-3c, both located on chromosome 4as. the density of unique snp markers within each cluster also varied. for example, four snp markers spaced at approximately 2 cm intervals formed a cluster on chromosome 4a in ast- <dig> , while a similar sized region  on chromosome 4b contained  <dig> snp markers in the same cultivar. similarly, in akt- <dig>  the densities of snp markers in each of the  <dig> clusters along nine chromosomes were variable. interestingly, the two clusters of  <dig> unique snp markers in sar- <dig> were particularly small, amounting to  <dig>  cm fragments each on the very distal parts of chromosome 2a . no clusters of unique snp markers were found for some chromosomes of the d genome, whilst only a single cluster was identifiable on each of chromosomes 6al, 1dl and 7ds. the most diverse chromosomes in this study were 3b and 6b, each with clusters of unique snps for four cultivars .figure  <dig>

genotyping and intra-varietal polymorphism
five to six independent dna samples from individual plants were used to assess intra-varietal genetic polymorphism for each cultivar by snp marker analysis . the ten cultivars were categorised into three groups. five genotypes  had no or very low intra-varietal polymorphism, and plants of these cultivars can be described as genetically uniform . the second group is represented by two cultivars  with moderate intra-cultivar polymorphism, where one of five studied individuals showed different snp marker alleles in a few genetic regions across different chromosomes . this polymorphism may represent residual heterozygocity in the cultivars, which is still segregating. three cultivars  fall into a third group and showed significant genetic intra-varietal polymorphism, showing that they represent mixtures of genetically divergent individuals . snp marker analysis indicated that the genetic diversity was smaller in two of these cultivars  but much wider in tze-3c, where genetic variability among two groups of individuals within this cultivar was comparable with inter-varietal polymorphism. we suggest that high levels of intra-varietal genetic polymorphism in the third group may reflect the method employed for breeding these cultivars .figure  <dig>

an example of the intra-varietal polymorphism in cultivar kaz-r is presented in figure 3a. the genotyping of five individuals in this cultivar can clearly distinguish the mix of two groups of genetically diverse plants:  №  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and  №  <dig> and  <dig>  heterozygous snp markers were sometimes registered in the three cultivars showing significant intra-varietal polymorphism, with the majority of then in cultivar tze-3c . however, their frequencies did not exceed 1% of mapped polymorphic snps.figure  <dig>

inter-varietal polymorphism and molecular-genetic phylogeny
despite a common geographic origin for all of the studied wheat cultivars, snp marker analysis demonstrated that they have broad inter-varietal genetic polymorphism . as expected, the most genetically distant genotype was the reference-pedigree cultivar ery- <dig>  the sole member of clade a. cultivar kaz- <dig> was most closely related to ery- <dig>  but was also genetically distinct from all other cultivars in this study . the remaining eight genotypes were categorised into four clusters of a single sub-clade c <dig>  while the cultivar kaz- <dig>  was developed at the same breeding centre as kaz- <dig>  they are genetically divergent. two cultivars  fell into cluster c2- <dig>  while two cultivars  were classified in cluster c2- <dig>  the three remaining cultivars  fell into cluster c2- <dig>  where pav- <dig> and kar- <dig> were closely related .figure  <dig>

the genetic polymorphism analysis of the ten studied lines was compared with a panel of representative diverse cultivars of spring bread wheats of broad geographical origin extracted from published data  <cit>  . reference-pedigree cultivar ery- <dig> was most distinct, sharing clade a with the very old american cultivar sonora, together with genotypes from china and south-central asia. both parts of clade b represented genotypes from north america , but also included the modern kazakh cultivar kaz- <dig> . clade c was quite diverse, with all remaining cultivars from kazakhstan falling into a single sub-clade c <dig>  genetic differences between clusters in sub-clade c <dig> were significant but much less when compared to genotypes in other clades. only cultivars from australia and the usa were found in clade d, indicating minimal genetic relationships with the genotypes from kazakhstan .

discussion
snp markers are a powerful tool for the study of genetic polymorphism, molecular phylogeny and for mas  <cit> . ten cultivars of bread wheat from kazakhstan were analysed with  <dig>  snp markers for intra- and inter-varietal genetic polymorphism. more than half of the markers  were polymorphic, and these were used for further molecular-genetic study. the proportion of polymorphic snp markers was similar to those previously published for both small and large sets of bread wheat germplasm:  <dig> us wheat cultivars and  <dig> diverse genotypes  <cit> , and  <dig> spring and winter wheat lines  <cit> , respectively. using the same 9 k infinium snp marker array for  <dig> elite bread wheat lines, würschum et al.  <cit>  reported that only  <dig> % of snp markers were polymorphic across the collection. however, only  <dig>  identified snps were ‘high-quality’ markers, because a relatively large portion of snp markers with either missing values or high heterozygosity  <cit> . recent results with a 90 k snp array for  <dig> hexaploid and  <dig> tetraploid accessions of wheat identified  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total number of snp markers as being polymorphic for australian and european material, respectively  <cit> . these results were similar to an earlier report  <cit> , where  <dig> % of 500 k snps were identified as polymorphic among eight uk bread wheat cultivars. the proportion of useful polymorphic markers obtained from ngs technologies depends largely on the data quality. it has been reported that the proportion of polymorphic snp markers can be increased with deeper sequence coverage. for example, an increase from 66% to 83% of total snp markers in a collection of durum wheats was achieved, when sequence coverage was increased from 12-fold to 16-fold  <cit> . however, the cost increases associated with enhanced sequence coverage may not justify a relatively moderate increase in polymorphic snps.

in the present study,  <dig>   of the polymorphic snp markers could be mapped to a chromosomal location, higher than the proportions reported in similar studies, of  <dig> %  <cit>  and  <dig> %  <cit>  and the distribution of the mapped polymorphic snp markers across the a, b and d genomes was similar to previous reports for both snp markers  <cit>  and ssr markers  <cit> . polymorphic snp markers were distributed more or equally between the a and b genomes, while there were fewer markers mapping to the d genome. the d genome in hexaploid wheat is the youngest one of the three, thought to have been introduced to hexaploid wheat around  <dig>  years ago as a result of natural hybridisation with aegilops tauschii   <cit> . by comparison, hybridisation between progenitors of the a and b genomes is estimated to have occurred between  <dig> - <dig>  million years ago, which is significantly older than suggested earlier  <cit> . the relatively recent introgression and narrow genetic diversity of the d genome may have led to the low snp rate seen in our and others’ observations, since genetic diversity is likely dependent on stochastic processes during wheat evolution  <cit> .

there were no strong trends noted for the frequencies of snp markers in each of the different chromosomes. table  <dig> lists chromosomes with the highest and lowest frequencies of mapped snp markers in genomes of hexaploid and tetraploid wheats. reasons for the observed variability may be related to the different sets of snp markers developed, and the broad diversity in wheat genotypes used across the different studies. interestingly, there was a tendency in the studies of bread wheat for low frequencies of snps on chromosomes 4a, 4b, 7b, 3d and 4d . a low frequency of molecular markers located on chromosome 4a of bread wheat may be related to ancient, non-homeologous translocations having occurred in this chromosome  <cit> .table  <dig>

wheat pedigree and molecular phylogeny in this study
the ten cultivars from kazakhstan were specifically chosen for this study for their productivity potential in drought-prone environment and reports of stable yields across multiple generations  <cit> . eight popular cultivars were developed and produced relatively recently by breeders in kazakhstan, while two much older, reference-pedigree cultivars were also selected.

erythrospermum  <dig>  is one of the oldest reference-pedigree cultivars and may actually represent a landrace. its original form was found as local germplasm in the ashkhabad region  in  <dig> and released as a cultivar in  <dig> . ery- <dig> has been characterised as being tolerant to drought and was used as a standard variety for many years during the soviet union era  <cit> . ery- <dig> also has potential salinity tolerance, although this has not been well documented. it was used as a pedigree-parent for at least  <dig> cultivars, with the last report of a registered cultivar in  <dig>  lutescence  <dig>  <cit> . ery- <dig> has not been used directly for generating breeding lines since around  <dig>  due to the availability of many new cultivars with more advanced characteristics . it is possible that some cultivars used in this study were developed with breeding material derived from early crosses made using ery- <dig>  but pedigree analysis indicates that ery- <dig> is genetically distant from all of the other studied genotypes  which would imply selection against ery- <dig> alleles in recent years. comparative analysis with a small panel of international wheats indicated that ery- <dig> is a member of the ‘historical-geographical’ clade a, containing older asian wheat genotypes. the central asian country turkmenistan  is geographically close to uzbekistan, china, india and pakistan, and therefore, their similarity is not unexpected. sonora is one of the oldest wheat cultivars, with originating as far back as  <dig> in mexico prior to its transfer to the usa  <cit> . it is unclear why sonora sits in the same clade a, together with ery- <dig> and other asian genotypes. we can speculate that asian genotypes in clade a with ery- <dig> had common ancestry with sonora. the modern american cultivar survivor  may help shed more light at this phylogenetic story but current record of the pedigree does not point to sonora  <cit> .

the second reference-pedigree cultivar was saratovskaya  <dig> , which has a shorter history than ery- <dig> . this cultivar was extremely popular in the former ussr but it has been replaced by more advanced cultivars based on the same germplasm, such as saratovskaya  <dig> . sar- <dig> was widely used for hybridisation and selection of new cultivars until relatively recently. sar- <dig> was included in a study of genetic polymorphism using srap markers, confirming the wide use of this germplasm for the production of new bread wheat cultivars in russia  <cit> . in our study, sar- <dig> had specific patterns of unique snp marker  and snp cluster distribution , not present in any of the other studied lines. this may indicate that some genetic fragments, particularly from the very distal parts of both arms of chromosome 2a, were never introgressed into modern wheats in kazakhstan. we speculate that these relatively small genetic fragments may contain deleterious alleles or represent regions of important new alleles from other sources.

in our study, sar- <dig> clustered in the middle of sub-clade c <dig> much closer to the eight modern cultivars in the phylogenic tree than ery- <dig> . the sub-clade c <dig> was very distinct and contained cultivars from kazakhstan and only a single chinese accession . by contrast, the most closely related sub-clade c <dig> contained australian and chinese genotypes but none from kazakhstan. this may indicate common genetic sources. sar- <dig> formed cluster c2- <dig> with ast- <dig>  ast- <dig> was generated from three rounds of backcrossing with a progenitor-cultivar, tzelinnaya yubileinaya, which has sar- <dig> in its parentage. sar- <dig> was also a direct parent of kaz- <dig> , although our analysis indicates that it is not as genetically related as ast- <dig>  in fact, kaz- <dig> fell into a separate sub-clade b <dig>  along with genotypes from north america . this intriguing observation may be explained by the presence of a common ancestor kanred  in the pedigrees of both kaz- <dig> and the american cultivar thatcher   <cit> . however, kaz- <dig> has the same ancestor but belongs to another sub-clade, c <dig>  the results suggest that there was strong selection in kazakh breeding programs for some genome regions found in north american germplasm leading to the observed position of kaz- <dig> in the phylogeny. this could represent a fruitful avenue for further analysis and breeding.

two clades  contained cultivars from north america , and from australia and the usa, respectively, demonstrating that studied genotypes from kazakhstan were distributed in other clades. interestingly, chinese cultivars were relatively widely spread across clades a, c <dig> and c <dig> in our study .

previous parentage analyses for kazakhstan wheat genotypes were based either only on genealogical pedigree study  <cit> , or on molecular-genetic analyses using  <dig> ssr markers  <cit>  and  <dig> ssr markers  <cit> , where eight of the wheat cultivars in these studies matched those included here. the different approaches showed some similarities. for example, in the present study, two cultivars ery- <dig> and kaz- <dig>  were most genetically distanced from the others, and these results were similar to those in the genealogical study  <cit>  and to our previously published analysis using  <dig> ssr markers  <cit> . by contrast, three cultivars from sub-clade c2- <dig> in the current study  also combined as cluster iii in the molecular-genetic analysis using  <dig> ssr markers  <cit> , but they were dispersed into three groups  in the genealogical study  <cit> . the pedigrees for kar- <dig>  tze-3c and pav- <dig> give no indication of a shared genetic history but they did originate from close geographic locations in kazakhstan. therefore, it is possible that breeders sourcing similar parental material for their selections. our observations of incomplete overlap between molecular and genealogical analyses are similar to a previous study using  <dig> elite wheat cultivars from wide geographic origin from mexico , india and china  <cit> . the authors reported relatively low but significant correlation between a genealogical pedigree study and molecular analysis using  <dig> ssr markers. there was greater consistency across the two studies for accessions that were more genetically distant than for those that were more closely related  <cit> . however, pedigree records are not always accurate, particularly for some older varieties, and many of the lines used in breeding programs carry quite high levels of heterozygocity or are mixtures of lines. the presented results of intra-varietal polymorphism using snp marker technology confirm our previous findings  <cit> . significant genetic polymorphism was identified in cultivar tze-3c, while kaz-r and kaz- <dig> showed more moderate intra-cultivar polymorphism . intra-varietal polymorphism has important applications in breeding program for checking of genotype purity during development of commercial cultivars.

there is, therefore, likely to be some genetic drift over time and lines included in studies conducted today may have a very different genetic makeup when compared to the same line used many years ago in a breeding program.

unique snp markers and distribution of their clusters
one aim of this study was to identify unique snp markers specific for each cultivar;  <dig> were identified,  <dig> % of the total number mapped. this is a slightly lower proportion but nevertheless comparable to other published proportions:  <dig> % for  <dig> bread wheat accessions  and  <dig> % for near-isogenic lines of durum wheat . this is likely due to differences in the sets of snp markers and germplasm used in the different studies.

the unique snp markers and their clusters tended to be distributed on the distal regions of both arms for each chromosome rather than in centromeric regions, reflecting the distribution of recombination events. our results are similar to those reported for the d genome of  <dig> accessions of aegilops tauschii using  <dig>  snp markers  <cit> , and consistent with the distribution of coding sequences in bread wheat  <cit> .

to our knowledge, this is the first description of the distribution of unique snp clusters to specific chromosomal regions within a set of germplasm . in our study, each of two cultivars, kaz-r and pav- <dig>  had a single cluster on chromosomes 3bl and 3as, respectively. two clusters were found in different regions on each of chromosomes 4as in tze-3c and 2a in sar- <dig>  ast- <dig> had three clusters  while four clusters were found in each of kaz- <dig> and kar- <dig>  the most genetically diverse cultivars were akt- <dig>  kaz- <dig> and ery- <dig> with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clusters of unique snp markers, respectively. identification of unique snp markers and knowledge of the locations of unique clusters can be used as a first step in the preparation of cultivar-specific markers for bread wheat. the identification of similar unique snp cluster regions in other populations may facilitate studies of the ancestry of such segments and indicate their significance in adaptation to specific environments.

CONCLUSIONS
this snp marker platforms provide a powerful tool for the molecular-genetic analysis of important agricultural crops such as bread wheat, due to the accuracy of the data and the relatively high-throughput. snp markers can be employed for careful and precise identification of genetic phylogeny and differences between genotypes. the distribution of unique snp markers and their clusters  across chromosomes is an additional defining characteristic of particular genotypes. the current results, reporting snp markers from ten cultivars of bread wheat from kazakhstan, support the potential application of 9 k infinium snp marker technology for the study of larger panels of kazakh wheat genotypes and for use in breeding programs in the country.

this initial analysis of current and historical wheat cultivars grown in kazakhstan has confirmed the relative isolation of kazakh germplasm from other wheat growing regions of the world. however, the study has also revealed some likely incursions of external germplasm notably from north america. the implication of these finding is that there may be considerable opportunity for genetic gain in kazakh breeding program through systematic introgression and evaluation of elite lines from other programs. with a very large production area but currently relatively low yields, there is a significant opportunity to improve wheat production in kazakhstan. it also appears that kazakh breeders have made little use of global elite wheat germplasm and, therefore, there is an opportunity for significant genetic gain. the situation in kazakhstan is likely to be reflected in a number of other regions where access to novel germplasm has been limited.
