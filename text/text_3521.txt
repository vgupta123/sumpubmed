BACKGROUND
arthropod-borne intracellular organisms that parasitize the cells of mammalian hosts must be able to manipulate a diversity of host cells to support their own growth and life cycle. revealing how they accomplish this will illuminate not only pathogenesis but also cell biology.anaplasma phagocytophilum  is a gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium, the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis , an emerging tick-borne disease. ap has a  <dig>  million base pair genome with  <dig> annotated features  <cit> . clinically, membrane bound ap colonies, called morulae, are seen in peripheral blood neutrophils. the white-footed mouse  is considered to be the primary reservoir for the ap variant responsible for hga, but other mammals are also susceptible  <cit> . ticks do not pass ap to their offspring, but to mammals they feed upon, which transmit it back to ticks, and so the organism cycles between tick and mammalian hosts.

hga is a potentially severe illness with symptoms, including pancytopenia and limb edema, that suggest other cells or tissues, beside neutrophils, are infected  <cit>  in mice, ap infects endothelial cells  <cit>  and human bone marrow cells support infection in vivo and in vitro  <cit> . the specific cells infected in ticks have not been unambiguously identified, however evidence indicates they reside within midgut and salivary gland tissues  <cit> . tick cell lines have been developed that support ap replication, including ise <dig>  which was isolated from ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of hga in north america  <cit> . susceptible human cell lines include hl- <dig>  a promyelocytic leukemia cell line that serves as a model for neutrophils, and the microvascular endothelial cell line hmec- <dig>  <cit> . ap produces distinct infection phenotypes and growth kinetics in these cell lines, suggesting, along with its broad host range, that the organism adapts to each host by shifting its gene expression.

the obligate intracellular lifestyle of ap makes direct biochemical, genetic, and observational study approaches inherently difficult. transformation of ap with fluorescent reporters has recently been achieved and should improve visualization of live bacteria, and open avenues for directed genetic research  <cit> . nevertheless, methods for functional genomic analysis, for example, specific gene knockout, are still lacking. gene transcription and expression analyses in animal models are largely impractical because ap levels in tick and mammal tissues are too low for recovery of sufficient bacterial rna or protein. in vitro studies have focused on characterization of the immunodominant p44/msp <dig> genes, which encode a large family of major surface proteins whose expression varies according to whether the organisms were derived from tick or mammalian host cells  <cit> . in addition, genes encoding the type iv secretion system of ap have been identified, transcriptionally analyzed, and described  <cit> , but their function and regulation remain undefined. dna microarrays have been used to measure changes in host cell gene transcription during infection, with an aim to infer the mechanisms and strategies applied by ap  <cit> , but no microarray studies that directly measure ap transcription have been published.

the release of an annotated ap genome sequence  <cit> , and development of maskless, photolithographic, digital light processor technology   <cit>  have made it feasible to characterize global transcript levels in ap using tiling microarrays  <cit> . with these technologies entire genomes can be probed instead of sampling only selected sequences. the continuous data generated can be plotted in genomic order as a line graph, with transcribed genes appearing as peaks rising from a baseline of non-transcribed or intergenic sequence, and peak height corresponding to relative transcript abundance. a direct alignment of this to a parallel, annotated map of the genome can provide a visually striking and intuitive way to assess the data. through affymetrix  and nimblegen systems, inc. , we designed a tiling microarray for the entire genome of ap  and characterized ap gene transcription in three cell lines representative of its life cycle  and pathogenesis in humans .

methods
cell lines, ap strain, and growth conditions
sterile and ap-infected hl- <dig> cells  were maintained in rpmi  <dig> medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  and  <dig> mm hepes. cultures infected with ap isolate hz were subcultured weekly by 1: <dig>  dilution of > 90% infected cells into sterile hl- <dig> cultures  <cit> . the hmec- <dig> cell line was received from the centers for disease control , and both sterile and infected cells likewise cultured in rpmi  <dig> medium with 10% fbs and  <dig> mm hepes  <cit> . infected hmec- <dig> cultures were fed daily and ap subcultured 1: <dig> bi-weekly when > 80% of cells were infected. hl- <dig> and hmec- <dig> cultures were kept at 37°c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig> in air. ise <dig> cells were propagated in l15b <dig> medium with 5% tryptose phosphate broth , 5% fbs, and  <dig> % lipoprotein concentrate  at 34°c  <cit> . ap-infected ise <dig> cultures were fed twice weekly with medium buffered to ph  <dig>  using  <dig> % nahco <dig> and  <dig> mm hepes, and subcultured 1: <dig> bi-weekly  <cit> .

ap strain hz was cultured from the blood of a new york state patient by co-culture with hl- <dig>  hz-ap-infected hl- <dig> cells  were simultaneously inoculated into the three cell lines. these infected parallel cultures were continuously subcultured and served as the source of infected cell samples for tiling array analysis. all samples from each cell line were from ap cultures between passages  <dig> and  <dig> 

tiling array design and manufacture
through consultation with affymetrix , a library of  <dig>  complimentary  25-mer oligonucleotide probes covering both dna strands of the ap genome   <cit>  was designed. each probe overlapped its neighbor by  <dig> bases for a probe resolution of  <dig> bases, the distance from the center of one probe to the next. probes were "hard pruned" – ridden of highly repetitive sequence elements thought to be irrelevant using an algorithm  to identify, somewhat subjectively, long repeat sequences. probes for these were not included, though probes for many "shorter" repeating sequences were. pruned sequences can be viewed easily in the artemis graphs. they are characterized by successive data points with the same or similar value that together produce large blunt peaks. for examples see additional file  <dig> coordinates 665858– <dig>  1025792– <dig>  and 645698– <dig>  nimblegen systems, inc.  synthesized the oligonucleotide probes in situ using a photo-mediated, maskless process in which the synthesis of each probe is directed by a digital light processor  <cit> .

isolation of rna
ap genomic transcription was measured in each of the three cell lines when cultures were approximately 95% infected. typically, cells contained hundreds of bacteria . rna was extracted from three ap-infected and three uninfected samples of each cell line . each sample was from a separate culture and consisted of approximately  <dig> infected cells or uninfected control cells. cells were suspended by pipetting  or with a cell scraper  and immediately centrifuged at  <dig> × g for  <dig> minutes. the supernatant was aspirated and discarded; cell pellets were loosened by flicking and immediately dissolved in tri reagent™ . all steps were performed at room temperature. total rna was then isolated according to the tri reagent™ product instructions. in brief, samples in tri reagent™ were extracted with chloroform and centrifuged at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. rna in the aqueous, upper phase was precipitated in isopropanol, collected by centrifugation at  <dig>  × g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c, and washed twice in cold 75% ethanol. rna pellets were dissolved in  <dig> μl rnase-free water, quantified by spectrophotometry, and processed for array analysis.

preparation of tiling array "target"
total rna from ap-infected or sterile control cells was processed for ap transcript measurement according to the affymetrix "prokaryotic target preparation" protocol using random priming of total rna to synthesize a single strand of cdna. the cdna was recovered by column purification, fragmented with dnase i, and end labeled with biotin. these biotinylated cdna fragment "targets" were hybridized to the "probes" contained on the tiling arrays, labeled with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate, and probe hybridization was quantified by laser scanning. the detailed protocol was as follows.

cdna synthesis
in a volume of  <dig> μl,  <dig> μg of total rna  was combined with random primers  , and, in a thermocycler, incubated  <dig> minutes at 70°c followed by  <dig> minutes at 25°c, then chilled to 4°c. to this reaction mixture was added  <dig> μl of the following master mix:  <dig> μl 5× 1st strand buffer,  <dig> μl  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> μl  <dig> mm dntps,  <dig>  μl superasein™  ,  <dig>  μl superscript ii  . samples  were incubated in a thermocycler  <dig> minutes at 25°c,  <dig> minutes at 37°c,  <dig> minutes at 42°c,  <dig> minutes at 70°c, and chilled to 4°c.

cdna isolation and fragmentation
to degrade rna,  <dig> μl of 1n naoh was added to each sample, incubated at 65°c for  <dig> minutes, and neutralized by addition of  <dig> μl 1n hcl. minielute pcr purification columns  were used according to product instructions to purify cdna from the samples. typical cdna yields were 3– <dig> μg. cdna in  <dig> μl was combined with  <dig> μl 10× one-phor-all buffer ,  <dig>  u dnase i/μg cdna , plus sufficient water for  <dig> μl total volume, and incubated  <dig> minutes at 37°c. dnase i was inactivated by heating to 98°c for  <dig> minutes. cdna fragments produced were 50– <dig> bases in length.

biotinylation of 3' termini of cdna fragments
the genechip® dna labeling kit  was used as follows:  <dig> μl fragmented cdna was combined with  <dig> μl 5× reaction buffer,  <dig> μl  <dig>  mm genechip dna labeling reagent,  <dig> μl terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and  <dig> μl water and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> minutes. the reaction was stopped with  <dig> μl of  <dig>  m edta and then frozen at -20°c until it was applied to an array.

tiling array hybridization and scanning
samples were hybridized to tiling arrays and scanned at the biomedical genomics center at the university of minnesota using the affymetrix fluidics station  <dig>  arrays were scanned using an affymetrix genechip  <dig> scanner according to standard affymetrix protocols.

tiling array data analysis
"cel" files generated by the university of minnesota's microarray facility were joined to affymetrix bpmap files specific to the tiling array using affymetrix® tiling analysis software . tas generated a list of signal intensities and arranged them in order of genomic location and dna strand. the data are available at the ncbi gene expression omnibus  database .

graphical representation of these data along with their annotations was accomplished with the java based program "artemis" . using a script developed internally, the intensity plots were reformatted and imported into artemis along with an annotation feature list . the resulting graphics give a visual overview of transcription as it relates to genomic organization, and provide clues to operon structure . the complete genome coverage provided by the overlapping probes on the tiling array translates into  <dig> spot intensities generated for a  <dig> base open reading frame . this large number of intensities, coupled with the quality of data suggested that creating a linear graph, and measuring the area under the peaks in regions corresponding to annotated open reading frames – orf transcription areas – would be a simple and useful method to quantify transcripts for each orf. to compute these orf transcription areas, the intensities were normalized via quantiles  <cit>  and imported into the igorpro data analysis program  along with the orf and structural rna annotations available from . a script was written to index a trapezoidal integration algorithm of the intensity list with the start and end genomic positions indicated on the annotation. this script operation generated a list of  <dig> transcription areas.

statistical evaluation of area differences, t values & fold change
orf transcription areas computed from the quantile normalized data  and paired  <dig> tail students t-test, were performed on: hl- <dig> vs. ise <dig>  hmec- <dig> vs. ise <dig>  and hl- <dig> vs. hmec- <dig>  orf transcription area comparisons with p values ≤  <dig>  were considered significant for determination of the number and identity of genes transcribed. determination of differentially expressed genes utilized the additional requirement that the mean orf transcription area be at least twice the mean orf transcription area of the same gene of the compared cell line.

the number of expressed orfs was determined by t-test comparison between the orf transcription areas from infected cell monolayers, and those of uninfected control cell monolayers. the signal intensity of these arrays was baseline corrected using the signal intensities of twelve manually selected intergenic regions devoid of obvious signal from across the span of the genome. orf transcription area comparisons with p values ≤  <dig>  were considered significant for determination of the number and identity of genes transcribed.

validation of tiling array data by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr 
five ap genes with known products were assayed for relative transcript abundance by qrt-pcr. tiling data indicated that four of the genes had differential transcription patterns between the human and tick cells: major outer membrane protein , outer membrane efflux protein , major surface protein  <dig> , and the  <dig> kda chaperonin . the fifth gene, which codes for succinyl-coa synthetase beta subunit , was transcribed equally in all three cell lines .

total rna , from three separate cultures of each ap-infected cell line , were assayed in triplicate by qrt-pcr. to eliminate any dna contamination, samples were dnase i treated using dna-free™ . dnase i was inactivated and rna purified using rneasy mini columns . mrna from each of the five genes was reverse transcribed and amplified quantitatively with primers designed using macvector  and netprimer  . the primers were tested by conventional pcr on a stratagene  robocycler with temperature gradient capability, using ap strain hz dna as target. formation of appropriate product sizes was verified and a single annealing temperature  and primer concentration  suitable for all five primer pairs were determined, allowing rna from each of the cell lines to be qrt-pcr-amplified together for best determination of relative transcript levels. reverse transcription and subsequent quantitative pcr were performed on  <dig> ng of each rna sample in 96-well plates using the brilliant ii sybr green 1-step qrt-pcr kit , and stratagene's mx3005p thermal cycler. to initiate the qrt-pcr, reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for  <dig> minutes at 50°c, followed by heat treatment for  <dig> minutes at 95°c to activate dna polymerase and deactivate reverse transcriptase. cdna was then amplified during  <dig> cycles of  <dig> seconds at 95°c,  <dig> minute at 60°c, and  <dig> minute at 72°c.

RESULTS
percentage of ap genes measured as transcribed in each cell line
of the  <dig> annotated features  <cit>  in the ap genome,  <dig>  were significantly transcribed  in hl- <dig>   <dig>  in hmec- <dig>  and  <dig>  in ise <dig>  compared to negative control samples .

differential ap gene transcription between cell lines
between hl- <dig> and hmec- <dig>   <dig> ap orfs  were differentially  transcribed . between hl- <dig> and ise <dig>   <dig> ap orfs  were differentially transcribed. between hmec- <dig> and ise <dig>   <dig> ap orfs  were differentially transcribed. adding a fold change criterion of  <dig> or greater, only one ap gene between ap from hl- <dig>  and ap from hmec- <dig>  passed: aph_ <dig>  one of the p44/msp <dig> paralogs. between ap-hl- <dig> and ap from ise <dig> ,  <dig> orfs , and between ap-hmec- <dig> and ap-ise <dig>   <dig>  were at least 2-fold different . the relatively low percentage of orfs measured as transcribed in ap-hmec- <dig>  was probably due to lower average signal intensity from those samples . we determined this to be the result of suboptimal biotin labeling after using a particular batch of terminal transferase. a new aliquot of terminal transferase used in the preparation of one of the samples of ap-hl- <dig> produced a particularly bright signal, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio for the ap-hl- <dig> data. because of this, and because differential transcription was low between the human cell lines , subsequent descriptions of differential transcription in ap-ise <dig> are based on comparisons to ap-hl- <dig>

summary of differential ap gene transcription between hl- <dig>  hmec- <dig>  and ise <dig> 

of the  <dig> ap orfs differentially transcribed  between the hl- <dig> and ise <dig> cells,  <dig> had higher levels in hl- <dig> and  <dig> had higher levels in ise <dig>  the  <dig> ap-hl- <dig> orfs comprise  <dig> known and  <dig> hypothetical proteins . all but three of the orfs that were up-regulated in ap-ise <dig> are annotated as hypothetical   and tick  cells). by comparison, 40% of all ap genes are annotated as hypothetical.

genes differentially transcribed  between human  and tick  cells. gene products  are listed in descending order of their transcript abundance in hl- <dig>  with their fold change indicated in the right hand column. gene products 1– <dig> were those more highly transcribed in hl- <dig>  and 77– <dig> were those more highly transcribed in ise <dig>  gene products predicted to be membrane associated  tended to be those most differentially transcribed – at the top  and bottom  of the list. the percentages of hypothetical genes, and the percentages of gene products that are membrane associated are also indicated. 

the amino acid sequences derived from the  <dig> differentially transcribed genes were analyzed using the secretomep cbs prediction server  <cit>  and the cello subcellular localization predictor  <cit>  to determine the probable cellular location of each of the gene products – periplasm, inner or outer membrane, extracellular , or cytoplasmic. while 25% of all ap genes products are membrane associated , 43% of the  <dig> genes differentially transcribed in hl- <dig> cells and 46% of the  <dig> genes differentially transcribed in ise <dig> cells code for non cytoplasmic proteins. as illustrated in table  <dig>  the greater a gene's differential transcription, the more likely it was to encode a membrane associated protein .

as illustrated in the artemis transcript level graphs , when the data are displayed as linear graphs alongside a map of the annotated genome, numerous transcription behaviors are revealed. transcribed sequences are seen to rise from the over-all flat baseline and generally correspond well to annotated orfs. however, there are examples of transcript signal extending beyond orf boundaries , transcription apparently not associated with an orf , and transcribed unannotated orfs . the orf identified between coordinates  <dig> and  <dig> is another p44/msp <dig> paralog, bringing the total number of p <dig> loci now identified to  <dig> . there are also numerous orfs and operons that showed no significant transcription in any of the cell lines .

paralogs of the p44/msp <dig> family of outer membrane proteins form a characteristic hybridization pattern that is somewhat perplexing. since p <dig> is abundantly expressed in ap, transcripts with sequences that correspond to the conserved ends of the gene should bind to all the probes on the array that are complimentary – i.e., those of over  <dig> genes. signals associated with the conserved ends of the p <dig> paralogs do rise sharply, while those that correspond to the hypervariable region  in between are generally near baseline. this produces a double horn shaped signature. most paralogs are not expressed within a population of bacteria  <cit>  therefore those that display bridged horns – representing transcript hybridization to the hvr – are likely to be specifically transcribed. in hl- <dig>  aph_ <dig>  and aph_ <dig> , and in hmec- <dig>  aph_ <dig> , aph_ <dig> , and aph_ <dig>  had strong signals associated with their hvrs, suggesting those paralogs were expressed. ap-ise <dig> produced no significant hybridization to any of the p <dig> hvrs, however along with ap-hl- <dig> and ap-hmec- <dig>  ap-ise <dig> produced strong signals to the conserved p <dig> sequences. in all three cell lines, signals to the conserved p <dig> sequences were greater than those from the hvrs – of the expressing paralogs noted in ap-hl- <dig> and ap-hmec- <dig>  in addition, this pattern of excessive hybridization to the conserved ends of the p <dig> orfs, is "reflected" in the non-coding dna strand. probes to sequences opposite conserved p <dig> sense sequences are hybridized significantly in the human cell samples, and as strongly in the tick cells as the sense probes, such that the horned profile appears reflected in the opposite dna strand. 

exceptions are p44- <dig>  p44- <dig>  p44- <dig>  and p44- <dig>  which have "conserved" ends that differ significantly from the other p44s; they produced no horns or reflections . subtler reflecting was also seen in several non-p <dig> orfs, such as aph_ <dig>  which codes for outer membrane protein hge <dig>  <cit> , and the hypothetical aph_ <dig> .

like conserved p <dig> sequences, repeat sequences, which are common throughout the genome, generally displayed strong signals on both dna strands .

at the p <dig> expression locus  both ap-hl- <dig> and ap-hmec- <dig> showed strong transcription beginning near base  <dig>  just before the start of the omp-1n gene, and continuing through the p <dig> expression site, while ap-ise <dig> did not. the p <dig> "horns" seen in ap-ise <dig> within the expression locus, are likely examples of the generalized hybridization to conserved p <dig> sequence noted above. the tr <dig> gene  upstream of the p <dig> expression locus, which encodes a putative transcription regulator  <cit> , is well transcribed by ap-ise <dig> but not by ap-hl- <dig> or ap-hmec- <dig>  the dna binding protein apxr .

the type iv secretion system genes identified by hotopp et al.  <cit>  consistently showed little activity in any of the host cells, while sodb , an iron superoxide dismutase shown to be co-transcribed with components of the type iv secretion system of e. chaffeensis and ap  <cit> , was moderately transcribed by ap in all three cell lines. ank  was strongly transcribed in ap-hmec- <dig>  somewhat less so in ap-hl- <dig>  and only marginally in ap-ise <dig>  this ap gene encodes a protein that is translocated to the nucleus of infected hl- <dig> cells  <cit>  and phosphorylated there within minutes  <cit> , presumably as an effector molecule delivered via the ap type iv secretion system  <cit> . located between genome coordinates  <dig> and  <dig> are eight paralogs of the trbc/virb <dig> gene family , six of which showed measurable transcript levels either only in the tick cell line , or the human cell lines . the relationship by amino acid sequence of these eight paralogs is illustrated in figure  <dig> , and indicates those transcribed in ise <dig> are more closely related to each other than those transcribed in hl- <dig> and hmec- <dig>  amino acid sequence alignments for the eight virb <dig> paralogs of ap  show identities that rank from a high of 93% between tick cell expressed paralogs aph_ <dig> and aph_ <dig>  and a low of 22% between non-expressed aph_ <dig> and human cell expressed aph_ <dig>  multiple alignment showed higher identity and similarity between the c termini of paralogs, which contain the functional portion of the proteins.

two apparent tick-cell-specific operons were identified. orfs between coordinates  <dig> and  <dig>  which include locus tags aph_ <dig> through aph_ <dig>  were transcribed only in the tick cell line . locus tag aph_ <dig> appears to be part of the operon and as such was transcribed in the tick cell line, and, at a lower level in the human cell lines. the functions of the hypothetical proteins of these six orfs are not known. however, a blast homology search produced e values of 9e- <dig> to 4e- <dig>  indicating the six orfs are related. the transcription profile around aph_ <dig> and sequence characteristics just up-stream, suggest that the orf actually begins with the methionine at coordinate  <dig>  in support of this, there is a ribosomal binding site at coordinate  <dig>  this upstream area shows significant amino acid sequence homology with the n-termini of the other orf members of this putative operon, also suggesting the sequence is part of that orf. between coordinates  <dig> and  <dig> an un-annotated orf appears to be transcribed only in the tick cell line, and also shows significant homology to the other orfs in this putative operon. if this is a true orf, and the start of aph_ <dig> is extended to coordinate  <dig>  the two putative orfs aph_ <dig> and aph_ <dig> on the positive dna strand may not be true orfs, since they are situated opposite coding sequences in the operon and showed no transcription signal . the other apparent tick specific operon includes locus tags aph_ <dig> through aph_ <dig> . all but the small locus tags aph_ <dig> and aph_ <dig> were transcribed. although these genes are also annotated as encoding hypothetical proteins, searches using signalp  <cit>  and tmhmm  <cit>  prediction servers indicated they all have transmembrane domains. there was also a group of ap genes transcribed only in the human cells: aph_ <dig>  aph_ <dig>  aph_ <dig>  and aph_ <dig> . all encode hypothetical proteins and all are related by amino acid sequence, especially aph_ <dig>  aph_ <dig>  and aph_ <dig>

discussion
total rna from ap infected human and tick cells was used to establish host cell specific ap transcription profiles by hybridization to complementary oligonucleotides representing the entire genome of ap on tiling arrays. the high percentages of genes measured as transcribed , and the low levels of hybridization produced by the uninfected control samples, demonstrate that the method and array design produced sensitive, consistent, and specific transcription measurements. this is encouraging since efforts to fractionate or amplify rna samples inevitably skew results. however, the culture samples analyzed were heavily infected and therefore optimal for such a direct approach. the three cell lines – hl- <dig> human promyelocytic, hmec- <dig> human microvascular endothelial, and ise <dig> tick – each produced bacteria with distinct transcription profiles, suggesting that ap gene expression is closely dependent on the phenotype and genotype  of its host cell. the bacteria assayed were not synchronized, they were the result of 1: <dig> inoculations, and therefore the transcription profiles generated were an average, perhaps with a "late stage" bias, of the infection process in each cell line.

transcription profiles between the two human cell lines appeared similar, however with better and more consistent biotin labeling the percentage of ap orfs transcribed in hmec- <dig>  is predicted to be closer to that seen in hl- <dig> and ise <dig> , and differences in transcription profiles between ap-hl- <dig> and ap-hmec- <dig> would be magnified to reveal additional essential characteristics of ap transcription in the human promyelocytic versus endothelial cells. transcription differences between the human and tick cells were extensive; there were many genes and apparent operons transcribed in the tick cells but not in the human cells, and vice versa. the fact that the vast majority of tick cell specific transcripts are for hypothetical genes is tantalizing, and likely reflects our ignorance of the molecular patho-physiology of ticks and their associated bacteria.

the observation that in all three cell lines some ap genes and operons remained inactive, is either an indication that there are genetic capabilities not called for by these in vitro infection conditions – the particular intracellular environments of each cell line and the laboratory growth conditions – or the failure of this method to measure the transcription of those genes. genes and operons that were truly silent may, among other possibilities, encode products specific to earlier stages of infection, to colonization of ticks following blood-meal uptake, or to parasitism of different hosts. given the distinct transcription profiles produced between the human and tick cells, and the diversity of animal hosts and cell types infected within each, all are possible explanations.

the virb <dig> paralogs of the type iv secretion system  identified as differentially transcribed  between the human and tick cells  represent host cell specific usage of type iv secretion system components. virb <dig> is the major protein that makes up the t4ss pilus, and has been shown to be necessary for full virulence in brucella abortus  <cit> . in ap, seven of the eight virb <dig> paralogs are annotated as being trbc/virb <dig>  family members on the entrez protein entries for each individual protein. aph_ <dig>  although not annotated as virb <dig>  shares homology with and is located next to the other seven. several other bacteria within the family anaplasmataceae also possess multiple paralogs of virb <dig>  which is unusual, as the majority of bacteria with type iv secretion systems have only one or two virb <dig> genes. a blast search done with aph_ <dig> shows, for example, that anaplasma marginale, as well as ehrlichia and wolbachia species, also have multiple loci annotated as trbc/virb <dig> family members . these bacteria might also express specific virb <dig> paralogs in a host cell dependent manner.

the absence of p <dig> transcription in ise <dig> at the p <dig> expression locus and clear transcription in hl- <dig> and hmec- <dig>  is consistent with the observation that the tick cell samples produced little or no hybridization to p <dig> hvrs, while the human samples did, and indicates that in ise <dig> little if any transcript was generated from any of the  <dig> full-length p <dig> genes. the lack of apxr transcript in the tick cells is consistent with the findings of wang et al., who performed quantitative reverse transcription pcr on ap-infected ise <dig> cells and tick salivary glands and found that apxr is not transcribed  <cit> . it was suggested that apxr generally regulates transcription in mammalian host cells and specifically regulates p <dig> transcription by binding to the tr <dig> promoter. the strong transcription of tr <dig> in the tick cells in this study may be due to a lack of suppression by apxr, which is not transcribed in the tick cells. the function of tr <dig>  therefore, is unclear.

the apparent over-representation of transcript from conserved p <dig> sequences, along with its reflecting behavior in the anti-sense strand, is unexpected. it may be the result of transcriptional "read-through" followed by the formation of stable double stranded, conserved sequence rna. bacteria are known to have poor control over transcription termination, and transcription of anti-sense sequence has been identified in mycoplasma genitalium  <cit> . since p <dig> paralogs are scattered throughout the genome on both dna strands, any adjacent gene transcription that continues into sense or anti-sense p <dig> sequences will create "false transcripts," the conserved sequences of which are complementary. conserved anti-sense false transcript may anneal to conserved sense "true" and false transcript to form double stranded conserved sequence rna, which is relatively stable compared to single stranded rna and thus would accumulate in the bacteria . sense and anti-sense p <dig> false transcripts could come from many of the numerous p <dig> paralogs, but a possible source of anti-sense p <dig> transcript in the tick cells is via read-through from the msp <dig> gene , which is opposite and just downstream of p44-15b and p44- <dig>  strongly transcribed in the tick cells, not transcribed in the human cells, and has no obvious transcription terminator.

it is possible that the anti-sense transcription noted in some genes, along with the prominent p <dig> transcription phenomena, function to regulate gene expression. in prokaryotes, cis- and trans-encoded anti-sense transcripts regulate coding sequence lying directly opposite or elsewhere in the genome, respectively  <cit> . although anti-sense mediated expression regulation mechanisms are poorly understood, some possible modes have been discussed and include: imprinting through dna methylation, rna processing interference, and ribosome interference  <cit> . in the case of p <dig>  anti-sense transcripts may serve to silence leaky expression occurring from any of the  <dig> identified full-length p <dig> paralogs  <cit> , which are apparently capable of being expressed independently from the p <dig> expression locus  <cit> . p <dig> silencing may be especially important in tick cells and account for the particular abundance of anomalous p <dig> conserved sequence transcripts in ap-ise <dig>  which showed no p <dig> hvr transcription. sense and anti-sense rna homologous to the conserved ends of the p <dig> genes may even facilitate the process of non-reciprocal recombination by which p <dig> paralogs move into and out of the expression locus  <cit> . if they are not purposeful, it is likely that these gene transcription phenomena are the result of poorly controlled transcription or are artifacts of the tiling arrays. the repeat sequence associated sense and anti-sense "transcripts" do appear to be an artifact of the tiling arrays, as they are consistently seen wherever repeat sequences occur, whether inside or outside of coding sequences. however, the transcription behavior of p <dig> is unique in the genome, and most genes do not display anti-sense transcription, therefore the over-representation of transcript to conserved p <dig> sequences and its reflection, and the anti-sense transcription of some genes, are intriguing and merit further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
obligate intracellular pathogens like ap control the cells they parasitize – to prevent immune attacks, divert cellular resources, and prevent host cells from apoptosing. our understanding of tick genes is poor so it is not surprising that the up-regulated ap genes in tick cells are nearly all "hypothetical." matched with our limited understanding of ap genes, the tick cell data are particularly difficult to interpret. conversely, it makes sense that the most differentially active ap genes in hl- <dig> cells are better characterized, since human cell lines have mainly been used to study the biology of ap, and, perhaps, ap genes evolved to interact in human cells would tend to be related to characterized effectors. it also makes sense that the differentially transcribed ap genes in hl- <dig> and ise <dig> are over-represented by membrane associated gene products, since survival in such disparate host cells would seem to require substantial specialization at the interface of the organism with its host cell: the bacterial membrane. the fact that a majority of ap genes have no known function poses the greatest challenge to interpreting these data. however, some things are clear:  <dig>  genes differentially transcribed between the human and tick cells disproportionately represent surface proteins  .  <dig>  there are genes, paralogs, and operons exclusively transcribed in the tick and the human cells, some of which may encode excellent vaccine candidates.  <dig>  the particular paralogs of the p <dig> family of membrane proteins  expressed in a population of ap may be identified by the elevated signal produced within the hvr of each as compared to silent paralogs.  <dig>  whole rna isolated from ap infected host cells can be used to reveal details of bacterial gene transcription, including that from anti-sense sequences.  <dig>  global transcription profiles can likely be generated for ap in any host cells, and for all aspects of the cell infection cycle – cell binding, entry, growth, and escape – although some enrichment for bacteria or bacterial mrna may be necessary. coupling ap transcription data with that of infected host cells will facilitate the discovery of ap and host cell gene functions.

having transcription data for all of an organism's dna sequence allows a line graph display for both dna strands parallel to an annotated map of the genome. this way one can readily see transcriptional behavior that may be less accessible through other analysis tools. for example, anti-sense transcription, and the variation in transcription profiles of genes – sloped, flat, horned, and reflected – may lead to important insights into ap gene regulation, as well as for other intracellular organisms that subvert host cell processes for their own benefit.
