BACKGROUND
transposable elements  have the potential to produce broad changes in the genomes of their hosts  <cit> , acting as a type of evolutionary toolbox and generating a collection of new regulatory and coding sequences  <cit> , and have the potential to generate biodiversity and evolutionary transitions through lineage-specific mutations and molecular domestication  <cit> . in addition, tes can be transferred between reproductively isolated species through horizontal transfer and can trigger a series of events that actively shapes genomic architecture, as for example through illegitimate recombination between te copies leading to chromosomal duplications, deletions or inversions, providing raw material for adaptive genomic innovations  <cit> .

based on their structure and transposition mechanisms, mobile genetic elements are divided into two classes: class i includes transposable elements that have rna as an intermediate  that is subsequently copied into cdna by a reverse transcriptase and integrated into a new genomic site; class ii includes the transposons that are directly transposed from dna to dna without another intermediate molecule  <cit> . retrotransposons can also be grouped according to presence or absence of long terminal repeats . ltrs are necessary for cdna transcription and integration after reverse transcription; these sequences contain domains for proteinase, integrase, reverse transcriptase, and rnase. non-ltr retrotransposons use internal promoters for their transposition and encode a reverse transcriptase and rnase; these retrotransposons are also known as lines  or tp  retrotransposons. additionally, sines  fall within the non-ltr category; these retrotransposons do not encode the enzymatic machinery necessary for transposition but probably obtain functionality via lines  <cit> .

various transposable elements are found in genomes and the same type of te can have very different invasive success in diverse species  <cit> . tes have been proposed to be involved in the biodiversity and speciation of teleost fish. teleost diversity is also reflected in the diversity of their genome size and structure, which have been considerably affected by retroelements  <cit> . all of the previously described retrotransposon types have been observed in fish genomes  <cit> , and among the non-ltr retrotransposons, rex <dig>  rex <dig>  and rex <dig> were active during the evolution of teleost fish  <cit> . the rex <dig> te is related to the cr <dig> clade of lines and encodes a reverse transcriptase, which is frequently removed by incomplete reverse transcription  <cit> . rex <dig> is related to the rte family and essential features of the element in fish are  coding regions for an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase,  5’ truncations of most of the copies,  a 3’ tail consisting of tandem repeats of the sequence gatg, and  short target site sequence duplications of variable length  <cit> . rex <dig> encodes a reverse transcriptase and a putative restriction enzyme-like endonuclease and is a member of the r <dig> family of non-ltr retrotransposons  <cit> .

fish belonging to the family cichlidae  are considered an excellent evolutionary model due to their adaptive radiation and their ecological and behavioral diversity  <cit> . among the cichlids, only the subfamily cichlinae is found in the neotropical region. analysis combining the morphological and nucleotide sequence characteristics allowed the subfamily cichlinae to be recovered as monophyletic and partitioned into seven tribes: cichlini , retroculini, astronotini, chaetobranchini, geophagini, cichlasomatini, and heroini . chaetobranchini and geophagini was resolved as the sister group of heroini and cichlasomatini. the mono-generic astronotini was recovered as the sister group of these four tribes. finally, a clade composed of cichlini and retroculini was resolved as the sister group to all other cichlines  <cit> . to date,  <dig> species of cichlids have been cytogenetically analyzed, the diploid number of chromosome is predominantly 2n =  <dig> , although variations ranging from 2n =  <dig> to 2n =  <dig> have been described. for african species, the modal diploid number of chromosome is 2n =  <dig>  in the other hand, for neotropical cichlids, the most common chromosome number is 2n =  <dig>  which is considered to be the ancestral characteristic for all cichlids  <cit> .

in the amazon region some species of cichlids are important in recreational and subsistence fishing, aquaculture, and aquarium-hobby, as cichla monoculus , astronotus ocellatus , geophagus proximus , pterophyllum scalare and symphysodon discus . cichla species have karyotypes with 2n =  <dig> subtelo/acrocentric  chromosomes, few heterochromatin and nucleolus organizer regions located on one chromosome pair  <cit> . this pattern is described as basal to the neotropical cichlids  <cit> . although a. ocellatus, g. proximus and p. leopoldi also have 2n =  <dig> chromosomes, they differ in karyotype formula, with meta/submetacentric  chromosomes due to chromosomal inversions, and accumulation of heterochromatin in the pericentromeric regions  <cit> . the highest diploid number described for cichlinae is found in species of the genus symphysodon, which has 2n =  <dig> chromosomes, as well as large heterochromatic blocks. these heterochromatic regions are rich in the rex <dig> te that seems to have been active in the karyotype evolution of symphysodon, being probable involved in translocation events  <cit> .

several te classes were cytogenetically mapped on the neotropical cichlid genome: tc <dig> transposons in cichla kelberi, which showed conspicuous blocks in the centromeric regions and small clusters scattered throughout the chromosomes  <cit> ; rck, which exhibits clusters scattered throughout the c. kelberi chromosome; aorex <dig> and aoline, which are clustered in the centromeric heterochromatin of all of the chromosomes of the complement in astronotus ocellatus <cit> ; and rex elements were mapped in few species  <cit> . furthermore, these findings are restricted to physical chromosome mapping, and the genetic diversity of these retroelements remains unknown.

rex <dig>  rex <dig> and rex <dig> are widely distributed among fish genomes, thus enabling comparative analysis among species. therefore, comparative analyses encompassing basal and derived species are of particular interest for understanding the role of retroelement dynamics in the genomic evolution of new world cichlids. this study aimed to evaluate the genomic organization of three non-ltr retrotransposons, rex <dig>  rex <dig>  and rex <dig>  in five amazonian cichlids of different tribes, comprising basal and derived species, using the combination of physical chromosome mapping and dna sequencing in the way to provide information about the role of tes in the evolution of cichlid genomes.

RESULTS
physical chromosome mapping of tes
for a better comparison of the physical chromosome location of rex retroelements in relation to the pattern of constitutive heterochromatin, chromosome distribution of telomeric sequences, and ribosomal sites described for the five species, we followed karyotypic organization recently proposed for these species  <cit> . the chromosomes were separated into classes , matched on the basis of hybridization patterns and organized in descending order of size. the rex <dig> retroelement was scattered throughout the chromosomes of cichla monoculus, astronotus ocellatus, geophagus proximus, pterophyllum scalare, and symphysodon discus. furthermore, astronotus ocellatus exhibited pairs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> with extensive distribution of this retroelement; similar results were observed for pairs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of geophagus proximus and for most of the chromosome pairs of symphysodon discus. however, all the species exhibited more conspicuous clusters in the terminal and/or centromeric regions with more markings in pterophyllum scalare .

multiple and intense sites of hybridization were obtained for the rex <dig> and rex <dig> retroelements in the five species assessed. these tes appear to have an almost pan-genomic distribution with larger clusters in terminal regions of most chromosomes from the five species, as well as in the centromeric, pericentromeric and interstitial regions. in the other hand, few unlabeled chromosomes were visualized .

based in the comparative analysis of the cytogenetic mapping results obtained in the present work with heterochromatin/euchromatin distribution previously published for the same species  <cit>  it is clear that most rex clusters are indeed located in heterochromatic chromosomal areas. however, small clusters of rex <dig>  rex <dig> and rex <dig>  seem also to be located in euchromatic areas .

molecular diversity of tes
a total of  <dig> rex <dig> clones were sequenced:  <dig> of c. monoculus,  <dig> of a. ocellatus,  <dig> of g. proximus,  <dig> of p. scalare, and  <dig> of s. discus. sequences of 573- to 575-bp  long were obtained. nucleotide substitutions were observed more frequently in the derived species  and less so in the basal species . no substitutions were observed in c. monoculus, whereas the following nucleotide substitutions were observed in the other species:  <dig> transition in a. ocellatus;  <dig> transitions in g. proximus;  <dig> transitions and  <dig> transversions in p. scalare; and  <dig> transitions,  <dig> transversions, and  <dig> indels  in s. discus. compared with the rex <dig> sequence of other cichlids available in genbank, a 91% genetic identity with hemichromis bimaculatus  and a 94% genetic identity with oreochromis niloticus  were observed. it was also possible to identify conserved blocks corresponding to the reverse transcriptase coding region, with corresponding similarity between s. discus and o. niloticus, as well as similarity among the others . the phylogenetic tree of rex <dig> element clones indicated separation between symphysodon discus and the remaining species, as indicated by two branches . these tree clustering do not reflect the phylogenetic relationship of the species assessed. however, all cichlid rex <dig> sequences form a monophyletic group  divergent from the marine perciformes species. the branch 1: grouped s. discus and cichlasoma labridens, , and form a sister group with oreochromis niloticus and hemichromis bimaculatus . the branch 2: encompasses sequences of c. monoculus, a. ocellatus, p. scalare and g. proximus. the average genetic distance between species varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> % among c. monoculus, a. ocellatus, p. scalare and g. proximus. this value is lower compared to the data detected by comparing these species with s. discus, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. the latter are similar to the average genetic distance between branch  <dig>  and african cichlids, which ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % .

sequences of 418-475 bp in length were obtained from the  <dig> rex <dig> clones assessed. there were a total of  <dig> clones of c. monoculus,  <dig> of a. ocellatus,  <dig> of g. proximus and  <dig> clones of p. scalare and s. discus. the rex <dig> retroelement was highly variable in all of the species assessed with the following multiple nucleotide substitutions:  <dig> in c. monoculus ,  <dig> in a. ocellatus ,  <dig> in g. proximus ,  <dig> in p. scalare , and  <dig> in s. discus . when compared with rex <dig> sequences from other cichlids available in genbank, an 87% genetic identity with oreochromis niloticus , a 91% genetic identity with cichla kelberi , and a 92% genetic identity with geophagus surinamensis  were observed. even with wide variations in the cloned sequences, it was possible to identify conserved blocks corresponding to the rex <dig> reverse transcriptase coding sequence . rex <dig> sequences of marine perciformes clustered separated from all cichlids species, and o. niloticus  appeared as sister group of the south american cichlids. with exception of c. monoculus, the other species formed paraphyletic branches and were not grouped into exclusive clades . regarding the genetic distance between species, the values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> % in neotropical cichlids, values which are close to those found when compared with african cichlids .

fragments between  <dig> and 505 bp in length were generated for the  <dig> rex <dig> retroelement cloned sequences. a total of  <dig> c. monoculus clones,  <dig> a. ocellatus clones, 30 g. proximus clones,  <dig> p. scalare clones, and 32 s. discus clones were sequenced. in addition, c. monoculus and s. discus showed high nucleotide substitution rates:  <dig>  and , respectively. nucleotide substitutions were also observed in the other species:  <dig>  in g. proximus,  <dig>  in a. ocellatus and  <dig>  in p. scalare. when compared with the other rex <dig> cichlid sequences available in genbank, the following sequence identities were observed: an 81% identity with oreochromis niloticus , an 83% identity with melanochromis auratus , and an 88% identity with crenicichla sp. . the sequences exhibited a region of homology with the rex <dig> endonuclease domain . the pairwise genetic distance between species ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> %  . the clones of each species were grouped into distinct branches on the phylogenetic tree for the rex <dig> element in which a. ocellatus appears grouped of all c. monoculus clones. african cichlids form a sister group to all south american species. all c. monoculus and a. ocellatus clones formed a sister group to the remaining derived species. geophagus proximus formed a sister group of crenicichla sp., which is a basal clade to the one that includes p. scalare, s. discus and cichlasoma labridens. in addition, two lineages of rex <dig> are evident in s. discus. one lineage related to sequences of c. labridens and another forming the basal group to the all analyzed species .

discussion
chromosomal distribution of tes clusters
recent studies have indicated that cichlids have a dynamic karyotype, with variations being observed in the chromosome number, karyotype structure, and in relation to the distribution of repetitive dna, with differences in the number and location of rdna sites, presence of interstitial telomeric sites in some taxa and pattern of tes distribution among species, which vary between dispersed and compartmentalized  <cit> . among the repetitive elements, tes stand out due to their ability to generate evolutionary change through various processes, including gene inactivation, the combining of exons, and gene conversion [for review, see  <cit> . in addition, ectopic homologous recombination between nonallelic copies of tes can lead to the formation of deletions, duplications, inversions and translocations, and the process of transposition itself can induce various types of rearrangements at the target site  <cit> . it has long been known that cryptic and non-autonomous tes accumulate in heterochromatic regions of the genome, including in fish  <cit> . however, in certain species, these transposable elements are found in euchromatic regions  <cit> . unlabeled chromosomes visualized for rex <dig> and rex <dig> suggests that the tes could have been lost due to molecular processes that erode repetitive dna sequences, or to the presence of few te residues could have escaped detection by fish. all specimens here investigated had their heterochromatic pattern previously described  <cit>  and presented accumulation of rex <dig>  rex <dig>  and rex <dig> clusters mostly in heterochromatic regions, but small clusters were also detected in euchromatic areas. this result indicates at least two hypotheses: i) the chromosomal distribution of these tes can be driven by particular evolutionary mechanisms and may evolve differentially from other repetitive sequences commonly present in the heterochromatin; ii) these tes could have acquired structural/regulatory functions and their movement to euchromatic regions could bring advantage to the host genome or have been maintained according to neutral mechanisms.

the movement and accumulation of tes has a great influence of host genomes, and it is becoming clear that tes form part of the regulatory toolkit of the genome and play important roles in controlling gene expression  <cit> , although the relationship between tes and regulatory function is not always straightforward and easily visualized. nevertheless, correlation between karyotypic rearrangements and retrotransposon activity was observed in the marine perciformes, for which compartmentalized distribution with accumulation in the pericentromeric regions is observed among the derived species, such as notothenia coriiceps <cit> .

chromosomal rearrangements are evident in cichlinae evolution, and interstitial telomeric sites  are recognized in astronotus ocellatus <cit> . these its are probably associated with various classes of repetitive dna, and these tes may have possibly acted in the chromosomal rearrangements of a. ocellatus because the retroelements rex <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> appear in the same chromosomal regions where the itss were observed  <cit> . the accumulation of tes in particular genomic regions of cichlids has been associated to possible events of chromosome rearrangements  <cit> .

tes can insert into virtually any portion of the host genome; however, certain preferred insertion regions have already been reported, such as in ribosomal genes  <cit> . an association between rex <dig>  rex <dig>  and rex <dig> and the 18s and 5s ribosomal sites was observed in all of the species assessed in this study. this association between te and rdna in cichlids may have had a role in the generation of multiple 18s rdna sites found in p. scalare <cit>  and the 18s rdna site variability observed in symphysodon aequifasciatus <cit> . analysis of the 18s rrna gene distribution in the oreochromis niloticus genome reveals that 18s copies are always surrounded by tes, suggesting that such elements could be acting in the dispersion of 18s copies generating higher number of clusters and sites variability  <cit> .

diversity and evolution of rex <dig>  rex <dig> and rex <dig> tes
although little is known about the genomic evolution and the effects of retroelements in fish, these elements appear to be responsible for the karyotype dynamism that has been recently revealed in cichlids  <cit> . this dynamism is also exemplified by an examination of neotropical cichlid te sequences. rex <dig> exhibited two evolutionary lineages, even being the most conserved te with few nucleotide substitutions. high values of genetic distance were found for rex <dig> among neotropical species  and . but the genetic distance was lower when compared s. discus  and o. niloticus .

the presence of various rex <dig> lineages has been observed previously in fish genomes with four reported lineages for this retroelement  <cit> . the clones assessed in this study correspond to lineage  <dig>  which is commonly observed in the genome of fish from superorder acanthopterygii  <cit> .

the emergence of lineages may be the result of the frequent loss or rapid divergence of these retroelements  <cit> . in addition, the high level of similarity among the rex sequences of some teleost fish species suggests relatively recent activity of this retroelement  <cit> . however, the rex sequences of cichlids showed a high degree of variability and rex <dig> showed a paraphiletic bayesian tree that does not reflect the phylogeny proposed for the group. in this case, probably several rex <dig> strains invaded the genome of these species and have been retained, with gain and loss of sequences within each species. furthermore, the presence of stop codons in the te aminoacid sequences suggests that these sequences correspond to inactive elements. if considered the group evolutionary history, perhaps rex tes have acted shaping karyotypes, but are no longer active. this fact can be reinforced because it is possible to observe conserved blocks corresponding to the reverse transcriptase domain of rex <dig> and rex <dig> and to the endonuclease for rex <dig> 

rex <dig> and rex <dig> nucleotide sequences were more conserved in the basal species  than in the derived species . this result is possibly associated with the selective forces that tend to stabilize the genome, which frequently eliminates te families from the genome of some species  <cit> , as the repression mechanisms in each host may be different  <cit> . furthermore, the genomic evolution of symphysodon is complex and involves hybridization events among the species  <cit> , which may have caused instability in the tes and led to transposition events that resulted in multiple chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . in contrast, rex <dig> exhibited high substitution rates in c. monoculus  that were similar to those observed in s. discus . rex <dig> presents a remarkable characteristic with two clearly defined subfamilies in s. discus. the accumulation of mutations may be associated with te senescence, which is usually characterized by an accumulation of mutations followed by the probable stochastic loss of the element  <cit> .

studies have demonstrated that te sequences evolve independently in the genomes of their hosts  <cit> , and this evolutionary pattern can be a consequence of horizontal transfer, which causes incongruence between the host and te phylogenies  <cit> . in this view, the phylogenetic trees of rex <dig>  rex <dig> and rex <dig> do not reflect the species phylogenetic tree  <cit> , and it is likely that horizontal transfer events occurred in these retroelements during the evolutionary history of the species that were assessed. although previous studies have suggested that rex elements could have suffered the action of horizontal transfer  <cit> , ancestral polymorphism and different te evolutionary rates among the hosts, including loss and gain of te copies, cannot be disregarded. although advances in undertanding the evolutionary dynamics of tes in cichlids have been achieved, the increase in sampling species and sequences is still necessary to have a better view of the organization and function of tes in the fish genomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of rex elements in cichlid genomes suggest that such elements are under the constraining of evolutionary mechanisms that lead to their accumulation in particular chromosome regions . there was no congruence between the trees generated in this study based on tes and proposed phylogenetic hypothesis for the group, suggesting that horizontal transfer, emergence or elimination of specific te lineages, could have had important effects in the evolutionary history of rex elements in the cichlid genomes.
