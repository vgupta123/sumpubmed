BACKGROUND
the globe artichoke cynara cardunculus is a member of the asteraceae  family, and originates from the mediterranean basin  <cit> . the species is subdivided into three taxa - the globe artichoke , the cultivated cardoon , and their progenitor, the wild cardoon . the edible part of the globe artichoke plant is provided by its immature inflorescence, referred as a capitulum or head  <cit> , and represents a significant component of the mediterranean diet. the cultivated cardoon is grown for its fleshy stems, which are used in traditional cuisine. leaf extracts of the species contain a number of bioactive compounds  which have been shown to have anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic activity, to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, and to enhance lipid metabolism  <cit> . the antioxidant content per serving of globe artichoke ranks very highly among vegetables  <cit> , while the roots provide a source of inulin, a proven enhancer of human intestinal flora  <cit> . in spite of its economic importance, however, little breeding effort has been applied to date in the globe artichoke.

progress has been made in the development of dna marker based genetic maps in globe artichoke  <cit> . the most saturated map has been recently developed from a set of f <dig> progeny of a cross between a globe artichoke and a cultivated cardoon genotypes  <cit> . this map consisted of  <dig> linkage groups comprising  <dig> loci and spanned ~ <dig> cm with a mean inter-marker distance of ~ <dig>  cm. a set of loci common to this map and a previously developed one  <cit>  allowed for map alignment and the definition of  <dig> homologous linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of the species.

it was long assumed that ssrs were primarily associated with non-coding dna, but it has now become clear that they are more frequent in transcribed than non-transcribed sequences and equally frequent in the transcriptomes of plants with dramatically different nuclear dna contents  <cit> . est databases therefore represent a convenient resource for the identification of microsatellites, some of which, as a result of their presence within coding dna, have the potential to deliver informative within gene markers, exploitable as cos  for genomic comparative analysis.

here, we report: i) the unigene assembly based on the globe artichoke est database deposited in genbank by the compositae genome project , ii) the identification of a wide set of est-based microsatellite markers and iii) the evaluation of the informativeness of a subset of these markers using a panel of c. cardunculus genotypes. furthermore, we performed a comprehensive functional annotation, inferred from sequence alignment , as well as a gene ontology categorisation inferred from sequence orthology  of the ssr-containing unigenes. at last we assessed whether motif type and relative position within cdss /utrs  may be preferentially associated with a particular gene ontology term.

RESULTS
est microsatellite discovery, frequency and primer design
globe artichoke ests were trimmed, assembled, and annotated using a customized bioinformatic pipeline  into  <dig>  unigenes  spanning  <dig> mbp. the transcript assembly and unigene consensus sequences are supplied as electronic supplementary materials . the unigenes had a mean length of  <dig> ±  <dig>  bp, with a mean gc content of  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  and a mean ambiguity code ratio of  <dig>  ±  <dig> . within the unigene set,  <dig>  contained  <dig>  uninterrupted tracts of  di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeats, delivering a mean microsatellite density of one per  <dig>  kb. comparable microsatellite frequencies and densities have been discovered in the transcriptomes of other compositae species  <cit> . only perfect repeats were selected, as these appear to be the more prone to strand slippage and, consequently, tend to be more polymorphic than interrupted ones  <cit> . sufficient flanking sequence  was present in  <dig>  of the unigenes, containing  <dig>  perfect microsatellites. the resulting pcr primers designed for these loci are given in additional file  <dig> .

allelic diversity with the est microsatellites
a subset of  <dig> microsatellites  was surveyed for their informativeness. the targeted amplicon length ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp and the set was selected to optimize the possibility of multiplexing on the capillary genotyping platform employed. the test germplasm panel consisted of twelve genotypes of globe artichoke, nine of cultivated cardoon, and seven of wild cardoon . in all,  <dig>  of the assays were successful; of these,  <dig> were informative among the taxa, while  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were polymorphic within, respectively, globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and wild cardoon . a total of  <dig>  alleles was generated from the  <dig> successful assays, giving a mean of  <dig>   alleles per locus. the largest range in amplicon length observed was  <dig> -  <dig> bp, observed for a tcan microsatellite . in 85% of the loci, the assay generated the predicted length of amplicon, in  <dig> % the amplicon was longer than expected, and in  <dig> % it was shorter. the allelic range  was greater for the wild cardoon  than for globe artichoke  or cultivated cardoon .

the  <dig> c. cardunculus accessions assayed for genotypic variation. respectively  <dig> globe artichokes,  <dig> cultivated cardoons and  <dig> wild cardoons were analysed.1globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and wild cardoon clusters defined in  <cit> , respectively.

main information reported: locus name, unigene /accession number , expected size, perfect microsatellite motif, number of repeats, observed alleles range, number of observed alleles , effective alleles , observed heterozygosity , polymorphic information content  and mapping utility for the three progenies . additional information are available in the electronic supplementary material. *data showing a multi-locus amplification were excluded from the analysis.

allelic diversity was, as expected given the breeding history of these taxa  <cit> , greater in the wild than in the two cultivated forms . the frequency of taxon-specific alleles was two fold more in the wild cardoon, and the polymorphic information content  was higher in the wild cardoon  than in either the globe artichoke  or the cultivated cardoon . the observed heterozygosity level  was significantly less in the cultivated cardoon than in globe artichoke, presumably because the globe artichoke is primarily a vegetatively propagated plant, and thus able to maintain a high level of heterozygosity over time  <cit> ; whereas cultivated cardoon is seed propagated and has been subjected to purifying selection aimed at increasing genetic uniformity for stabilizing its production. we previously developed three mapping population for the development of c. cardunculus genetic maps by crossing one globe artichoke non spiny genotype  with a spiny genotype of globe artichoke or cultivated cardoon or wild cardoon. when the parents of the three mapping populations were tested with the set of microsatellites,  <dig> were informative in at least one combination, while  <dig> across all the three combinations, thus supplying landmarks for comparative mapping of phenotypic and quantitative trait loci . as expected, the most polymorphic combination  was the one involving the cross between the most genetically divergent taxa: globe artichoke and wild cardoon .

diversity analysis
the informativeness of the newly developed est microsatellites was comparable with that described for microsatellite markers in globe artichoke  <cit> , sunflower  <cit>  and lettuce  <cit> . a set of five est microsatellites was sufficient to discriminate between each of the  <dig> members of the germplasm panel . the inferred genetic relationships were in good concordance with those derived from aflp profiling  <cit> . thus, the globe artichoke accessions clustered with one another , but two sub-clusters, corresponding to the contrasting capitulum types , could be recognised. the clade most closely related to the globe artichokes contained the cultivated cardoons , and among these, the most well differentiated accession was 'bianco pieno migliorato', as previously observed  <cit> . the spanish cultivated cardoon accessions were genetically very similar to one another. the wild cardoon accessions formed a discrete, but rather loose group . a principal co-ordinate analysis further illustrated the genetic relationships between members of the germplasm panel . axes  <dig> and  <dig> accounted for ~ 73% of the genetic variation, the former contributing ~ 47%, and the latter ~ 26%. axis  <dig> distinguished the globe artichokes from the cultivated and wild cardoons, while axis  <dig> separated the two cardoon taxa. as expected, f <dig> progenies mapped to intermediate positions with respect to those of their parents .

distribution of microsatellite
of the  <dig>  microsatellites, trinucleotide motifs accounted for 49%, dinucleotides for 33%, hexanucleotides for 13%, tetranucleotides for 3% and pentanucleotides for 2% . only ests  having a non-ambiguous ortholog in arabidopsis thaliana were taken forward for the purpose of annotation. the position of the microsatellite tract  was derived from the blastx result in conjunction with the orf -predictor algorithm  <cit> . about 33% of the microsatellites were present in the 5'-utrs, ~ 20% in the 3'-utrs and ~ 47% in the cdss , similar to the relative frequencies in both the a. thaliana and rice genomes  <cit> . most of the cds microsatellites consisted of trinucleotides, while dinucleotides were the most abundant in the 5'-utrs, and di- and trinucleotides were equally represented in the 3'-utrs. tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs were more frequent in the 3'-utrs than in either the cdss or the 5'-utrs . trinucleotide  motifs are expected to predominate in the population of cds microsatellites, as variation in their repeat number is not associated with a frame shift event  <cit> . the most abundant dinucleotide repeat was ag/ct, followed by ac/gt, although at/ta predominated in the 3'-utrs. among the trinucleotides, the most frequent was aag/ctt, followed by atc/gat and cac/gtg . this distribution is consistent with the situation in a. thaliana and brassica spp. orthologs, in which a preference for ag/ct and aag/ctt motifs has been identified in the 5'-utrs, thought to be associated with the cis-acting regulation of transcription  <cit> . in the globe artichoke 5' utrs, dinucleotide motifs were over-represented, with ag/ct being the most abundant , similar to the situation in the 5'-utrs of many plant  genes  <cit> , which has been reported to play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation at the rna level  <cit> . dinucleotide motifs were also frequent in the 3'-utrs, possibly because at-rich elements are able to act as cis mediators of mrna turnover  <cit> . overall, present data confirm that homopurine/homopyrimidine repeats contribute markedly in 5'-utr and cds, as previously reported by morgante et al  <cit> .

the function of genes containing microsatellites
microsatellites within coding sequences can have a major effect on gene activity, since the expansion/contraction of triplets within the coding sequence alters the gene product, thereby sometimes causing a significant phenotypic change. in humans, the effects on phenotype due to the presence of ssrs in coding regions of genes playing key roles in neuronal disorders and cancer have been extensively studied  <cit> . among the microsatellites in the globe artichoke transcriptome, the six most frequent amino acid stretches present in the cds were poly-serine , poly-aspartic acid , poly-glutamic acid , poly-lysine , poly-glycine  and poly-threonine . it has been reported that particular amino acid repeats tend to be associated with specific classes of proteins  <cit> . acidic and polar amino acid repeats have generally been associated with transcription factors and protein kinases, whereas serine repeats are common within membrane transporter proteins  <cit> . in the globe artichoke, poly-serine and poly-glycine stretches are particularly frequent in the cds. poly-serine linkers are common in eukaryotic genomes, and are thought to provide a flexible interdomain. they are frequently associated with modular proteins, and are involved in complex carbohydrate degradation  <cit>  and the binding of proteins with extracellular matrix components, such as the laminin binding protein. poly-glycine  microsatellites may provide a domain for dna binding or protein-protein interactions, and has been found to be necessary for chloroplast envelope targeting. poly-glutamic and poly-aspartic acid tracts feature in many nls  proteins  <cit> , and it has been suggested that both basic karyophilic and acidic clusters can enhance their selective binding to transport machinery components  <cit> . poly-glutamic acid stretches have also been implicated in transcription activation/de-activation  <cit> , and microsatellite allelic variants of these genes have been identified as the genetic basis of a number of human diseases  <cit> .

to support the occurrence of certain repeated motifs in the assembled unigenes we have exploited sequence alignment and gene ontology in order to annotate their functions and assess whether their motif type and position are preferentially associated with a particular gene ontology term.

in preparation, the set of globe artichoke unigenes was filtered to include only those with a blastx e-value of < 1e- <dig> when matched with the a. thaliana reference protein set. in all,  <dig>  queries satisfied this criterion . the a. thaliana gene accession numbers were used to categorize the unigenes using tair gene ontology . the gostat <dig> web interface was then used to identify gene ontology categories which were over-represented. by comparing either the set of microsatellite-containing unigenes, or subsets of it  with the complete set of annotated unigenes, it was possible to identify over-representation in gene ontology  categories . microsatellites appeared to be over-represented in loci involved in certain biological processes and functions, while no significant association was found with go cell components .

go terms statistically enriched  for specific ssrs subsets. fisher's exact test was performed between each ssrs subset versus the whole unigenes categorization; only significant over-represented subset are reported . analysis is displayed referring to "biological process" and "molecular function" classifications; "cellular component" is not reported due to the absence of particular enriched subsets.

most of the unigenes containing trinucleotide motifs in their cds were associated with nucleic acid metabolic processes , transcription  and the regulation of transcription , consistent with the encoding by the gat trinucleotide of aspartic acid, since stretches of this residue are characteristic of 'karyophilic' acidic clusters in nls  proteins. similarly, the aag/ttc motif, which occurred frequently in the cds, encodes poly-glutamate, which is thought to be involved in both protein-dna complex assembly  and heterocyclic metabolic processes . unigenes carrying dinucleotide motifs in their cds were found to be specifically associated with the response to stimulus . the ag/ct repeats in the cdss were over-represented among genes responding to stress , involved in dna repair  and in nucleic acid binding . this is consistent with the presence of domains involved in protein-rna/protein-protein sticky interactions.

the commonest microsatellite motifs occurring in 5'-utr of unigenes were dinucleotide repeats . these unigenes were associated with nucleic acid metabolism , the regulation of gene expression , transcription  and the regulation of transcription . ag/ct repeats were also over-represented in genes involved in the response to aba . moreover, trans-acting elements , which show an over-representation of trinucleotidic  in their cdss, were also frequently enriched in their 5'utrs by ag/ct motifs, suggesting a cascade of signal transmission. trinucleotide motifs were not common in the 5'-utrs, except in genes involved in the response to auxin stimulus .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated here the utility of a set of de novo globe artichoke est-based microsatellite markers for the definition of genetic diversity, phylogeny and genetic mapping. since est microsatellites lie within expressed sequences, they have the potential to represent perfect markers for genes underlying phenotypic variation. most of these assays are fully transferable to other c. cardunculus taxa, providing anchor points for the integration of taxon-specific genetic maps. the functional annotation of these est sequences increases their utility as a source of gene-based markers for the study of synteny and other applications.
