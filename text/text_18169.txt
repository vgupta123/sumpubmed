BACKGROUND
since the finishing of the whole genome sequencing of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana and its first annotation by the international arabidopsis community  <cit> , gene prediction results have been regularly updated  <cit> . indeed, the mips and the tigr have made available a new annotation release each year taking into account the completion of the genome sequence, the improvement of gene prediction tools and the increasing number of transcript sequences in the database  <cit> . the latest version is based on recent annotation carried out by tair  <cit> . in addition to this global semi-automatic annotation, different works have also improved arabidopsis gene detection using orphan ests  <cit> , comparative genomics  <cit> , or combination of data through expertise of gene families  <cit> .

in the framework of the european catma project  <cit> , a micro-array was produced with  <dig> specific gene sequence tags . these gsts were defined from the arabidopsis genome sequence to be highly specific in order to minimize cross-hybridization  <cit> . the gst design was based not only on the tigr annotation, but also on the predictions of protein coding genes obtained with the eugene v <dig>  software  <cit> . indeed, by combining different information , eugene has provided an alternative arabidopsis genome annotation. by comparing with the tair version  <dig>  annotation release, the catma v <dig> gsts tag  <dig>  <dig> arabidopsis tair genes and  <dig> regions defined up to now as intergenic. these  <dig> gsts, specific to the catma resource, are excellent tools to reveal possible under-predicted functional genes in arabidopsis. furthermore, several predicted genes are tagged by at least  <dig> distinct gsts, most often one overlapping each gene extremity. previous works on gene annotation pointed out that erroneous gene merging is a usual shortcoming of gene predictors  <cit> . with different gsts associated with the same genes, we have a powerful way to identify such critical situations.

available public transcriptome data produced with the catma micro-arrays were used to investigate these questions  <cit> . the dataset of  <dig> hybridizations using  <dig> different samples covers numerous developmental stages, biotic and abiotic stresses and mutants. all the micro-array experiments were performed in our laboratory with a normalized protocol of labeling, hybridization, data normalization and statistical analysis ensuring a perfect homogeneity of the data.

RESULTS
selection of candidate gsts
candidate gsts were extracted from the flagdb++ database  <cit> . flagdb++ also contains tair gene annotations, available transcript sequences and the latest version of the eugene predictions  for the arabidopsis genome. the gene extremities were extended using overlapping cognate transcript sequences . this improved definition of utrs allowed us to discard gsts which are outside annotated cds but which overlap extended transcriptional units. similarly, gsts mapped less than  <dig> bp away from the extremity of a predicted cds without cognate transcripts were not selected since they could correspond to the unknown utr region of the corresponding mrna. the  <dig> gsts mapped outside tair annotated genes, pseudogenes or known rna genes  were selected as novel candidate genes. among these  <dig> candidates,  <dig> occur in eugene models, which extend tair cds models. the corresponding expression data provide an improvement of cds annotation .

characterization of novel genes
the transcriptome data obtained with the selected gsts for  <dig> hybridized samples coming from  <dig> different experimental projects have been extracted from the catdb database  <cit>  and analyzed by a dedicated statistical protocol . among the  <dig> candidate gsts not in extensions of tair models,  <dig>  i.e. 72%, showed hybridization in at least one sample and probably point out novel genes. to validate the transcriptome results, we performed a rt-pcr for each of the  <dig> putative novel genes using  <dig> different mrna samples from roots, leaves, flowers and pollen. we obtained amplicons for  <dig> genes  and sequenced all of them. for  <dig>  we obtained a rt-pcr product with a sequence matching the expected target. thus, for 88% of the putative novel genes, we obtained a proof of transcription by two different experimental approaches.

to further characterize the newly identified genes, we performed additional data-mining . other independent evidence of transcription was found for  <dig> genes  through cognate ests or cdnas, mpss tags  <cit>  or rt-pcr products recently obtained by tigr  <cit> . indeed, tigr used race-pcr to test  <dig> arabidopsis gene models only predicted by the twinscan  <cit>  or eugene  <cit>  programs. the intersection between the  <dig> novel genes found by the tigr approach and the  <dig> novel genes from this work only concerns  <dig> genes  for which we confirm gene localization and add their conditions of expression in  <dig> samples.

sequence comparisons at the protein level and a search for pfam motifs  <cit>  were applied to each newly identified gene. for  <dig> genes , significant similarities were detected at least in one other locus in the arabidopsis genome and/or with proteins from different species, indicating that they belong to known gene families . nevertheless, inference of function by similarity could be made for only  <dig> genes  and the remaining  <dig> genes encode proteins with unknown biochemical function. surprisingly,  <dig> genes  were previously annotated by agi members at the bac scale  but their model was ignored in the whole genome annotation done later, probably because of poor supporting data.

in 61% of the cases, the latest eugene v <dig>  annotation provided a gene model. in the remaining 39%, we have evidence of the presence of transcriptional units overlapping the gst position but not any additional information on their intron-exon structure. between the eugene version used to design catma gsts and the latest eugene version, the number of false positive predicted genes decreased but some true positive genes were lost.

based on the eugene predicted models, the newly discovered genes are mainly characterized by their short size with a cds average of  <dig> bp compared to  <dig> bp for the already known arabidopsis cds . consequently, the mean intron number is quite low with  <dig>  introns per cds  compared to an average of  <dig>  for all the annotated cds. this result could explain why these genes were missed by automatic annotation. indeed, their coding potential  may be difficult to detect by a semi-hmm and sequence comparisons are quite likely to generate hits with low scores not or under considered in the gene prediction process. furthermore, mrna materials used for est libraries are usually selected against small size mrna. beyond this, our approach has also detected large conserved genes such as cds of  <dig> and  <dig> exons encoding an importin and an atpase respectively .

the topological distribution of the  <dig> novel genes is quite similar to all the arabidopsis coding genes. they are evenly distributed in the  <dig> chromosomes and are rarely present in the peri-centromeric regions or other identified heterochromatic regions.

in  <dig> additional cases, expression signals associated with candidate gsts have highlighted an erroneous annotation of the neighbor gene and have led to the improvement of gene models by significant extension of their respective cds. the extension of these  <dig> cds  is always confirmed by the coherent extension of similarities with homologous proteins .

expression of novel genes
the comparison of the transcription data obtained from  <dig> hybridized samples for the  <dig> novel genes and all the  <dig>  <dig> arabidopsis genes tagged by a catma v <dig> gst shows interesting features at the functional level. most newly identified genes are detected in a limited number of experimental conditions , even if the rt-pcr results may show a basal level of transcripts due to a higher sensitivity. indeed, 40% of the novel genes have been detected in  <dig> to  <dig> mrna samples while there are only 16% of all the arabidopsis genes in this category. furthermore, only  <dig> genes  have been detected in more than 30%  of the analyzed conditions. this number is very low compared with the 28% of all the arabidopsis genes that are detected in the same number of conditions. the tail of the distribution in figure  <dig> clearly shows that the novel genes identified by this work are never detected in more than 95% of the hybridized samples. thus, they do not belong to the category of constitutively expressed genes also frequently referred to as housekeeping genes. we have found  <dig> novel genes  for which expression is reported in only one organ. even if we cannot conclude that there is complete organ-specificity from our data, the transcription of these  <dig> genes is clearly highly preferential in only one organ. indeed, the observed distribution of the transcription of the  <dig> genes between the different organs  is not simply explained by the distribution of the  <dig> hybridization samples among the different organs . for instance, we found  <dig> novel genes expressed in one leaf sample only, which is significantly more than the  <dig>  expected  based on the  <dig> leaf samples.

three explanations that are not fully exclusive may be given to the rarely observed transcription of several novel genes. first, we may consider that some probes give an artefactual signal in one hybridization. nevertheless, in any urgv-catma transcriptome experiment, a dye-swap is systematically done. a dye-swap is a technical repetition performed with the same biological samples and the two hybridizations of a dye-swap only differ by the dye, cy <dig> or cy <dig>  tagging the two samples. data for a probe are retained only if results are consistent in the two technical replicates. furthermore, this explanation is also largely ruled out by the fact that we confirmed, by rt-pcr and sequencing, the transcription of 88% of the novel genes. second, it is possible that the transcriptome approach allows, on rare occasions, the detection of an expression of genes constitutively expressed at low level. indeed, constitutive genes always expressed at low level would generally give hybridization intensities below the thresholds for considering the corresponding probes as hybridized. it is only in a small number of experimental conditions when the expression is just slightly higher than in all other experimental conditions that the probes corresponding to these genes would be recognized as hybridized by the statistical method applied to the normalized data. third, the signal responsible for the hybridizations that are unique but consistent within technical replicates might depend on relatively rare physiological or environmental situations. we tried to evaluate the relative explanatory potential of the last two expectations by comparing the distributions of intensity signals for both the whole genome and the novel genes. we expected that genes expressed constitutively but at low level would present a maximum signal hybridization intensity lower than the genomic distribution for this parameter. it is particularly clear that novel genes show the same relationship between the number of hybridized samples and the maximum signal intensity as the whole genome does . there is no novel gene for which the maximum intensity signal distinctly departs from the known genes showing the same number of hybridized samples. thus, all together the transcriptome data for the novel genes suggest that the transcription of several of these genes are not only organ specific but also more specific to rare endogenous or environmental conditions than the whole genome. this double control of transcription might well explain our observation of transcription of several novel genes in only one biological sample. for this reason, the transcripts corresponding to these genes are less often present in the cdna libraries which, in arabidopsis, cover several organs but relatively few different environmental conditions.

erroneous gene merging
in  <dig> loci, distinct gsts match a single gene  according to the tair annotation but two different gene models were predicted by eugene. for  <dig> loci, the transcriptome results show that two gsts associated with the same gene provide opposite ratios in the same experiment, thus suggesting that they actually match two different genes . the fact that an erroneous gene merging has occurred during the automatic annotation process is reinforced by similarities with two distinct proteins. the example reported on figure  <dig> shows that the tair predicted calcium-dependent protein kinase at2g <dig>  corresponds to  <dig> eugene predicted genes: a myb motif containing gene and the cdpk, respectively corresponding to gst  <dig> and  <dig>  in three independent experiments the two gsts provide significant ratios  indicating that gene  <dig> is up-regulated while gene  <dig> is down-regulated in the same experiment. it also shows that the cognate affymetrix probe set  only reports the expression of the cdpk.

CONCLUSIONS
the catma microarrays, based on both eugene v <dig>  and tigr annotations, allowed us to discover  <dig> novel genes and to improve  <dig> gene models . furthermore, the analysis of the transcriptome data from  <dig> hybridized samples brings an additional functional dimension with numerous expression conditions of these novel and corrected genes. the biological and biochemical roles of the large majority of the novel genes remain unknown since only 15% of them share similarities with proteins of known function . however, the analysis of the large transcriptome data available through catdb  <cit>  may provide the first insights as to their functions. inference on functions for unknown genes by such a compendium approach has already been successfully reported on yeast  <cit> .

the fact that eugene markov model detects a high coding potential at these loci suggests that the novel genes are encoding proteins, with a short mean size , and are not rna genes or huge extensions of neighbor gene utrs. despite recent works based on different methods  <cit> , our results show that the "intergenic" section of the arabidopsis genome is again reduced by the discovery of short genes characterized by a limited number of conditions promoting their expression. a recent application of the affymetrix tiling array has recently highlighted novel transcribed regions in the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . the intersection with our results concerns only  <dig> genes. the fact that the tiling approach missed several novel genes detected by our catma based approach might be explained by the comparatively limited number of mrna samples used by hanada et al.  <cit> . in april  <dig>  tair released the 7th version of the annotation genome with  <dig> new genes compared to the previous one  <cit> . only  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> novel genes identified by this work have been re-annotated at the structural level. as expected, these  <dig> genes are mainly those supported by cognate transcript sequences . all these results strongly illustrate that the annotation process is a long and difficult task and that many years are necessary after the first release of the sequence of a complex eukaryote genome to obtain  full knowledge of its gene content. even  <dig> years after the publication of the complete sequence of the  <dig> arabidopsis chromosomes  <cit> , this goal has not yet been achieved. as our work shows, further progress requires the association of several and complementary approaches based on high-throughput experimental work and ab initio predictions. due to the diversity of the possible approaches, in terms of confidence level and information content, the integration of the results is a process of increasing complexity that benefits a large community through the step-by-step updates of the arabidopsis gene annotation previously done by tigr  <cit>  and pursued by tair  <cit> .
