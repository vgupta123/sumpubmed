BACKGROUND
transcriptome sequences provide valuable resources for research in comparative genomics, population genetics, and evolutionary biology. although numerous crop and some tree species have fully sequenced and annotated reference transcriptomes , there is still a need for more sequences from ecologically important taxa. oaks  are ecologically and economically important species that lack a reference genome or transcriptome and would benefit from such resources  <cit> . to date, the genomic sequence resources available in oaks are limited primarily to expressed sequence tags  in the european white oaks, q. robur l. and q. petraea  liebl. , and in the eastern north american oaks, q. alba l. and q. rubra l.  <cit> , and many of those resources remain under development  <cit> . research in population genetics, genomics, evolutionary biology, hybridization, response to the environment, and global change biology of oaks would benefit from an annotated transcriptome assembly and deep panel of nucleotide polymorphisms, especially in species and geographic regions with fewer such resources to date. high-throughput, short-read rna-seq data have enabled the rapid development of reference sequences and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms  among those sequences  <cit> .

here, we present the most complete transcriptome for white oaks  and among the largest snp data sets available for trees using pooled rna-seq data from  <dig> q. lobata née ,  <dig> q. garryana dougl. , and — accidentally —  <dig> probable hybrid q. lobata × q. douglasii hook. & arn.  . using multiple species and multiple individuals within q. lobata enabled us to identify large snp panels useful for both inter- and intraspecific studies, as well as develop reference sequences relevant to a broader array of california white oaks. these species are closely related  <cit>  and hybridize with varying frequency in zones of overlapping distribution . each has distinct morphological characteristics and ecological niches, with q. lobata occupying valley floors, q. douglasii occupying hillsides, and q. garryana occupying wetter, higher elevation sites.table  <dig> sample information

we used our reference transcriptome and snp data to perform preliminary comparative analyses, testing for signatures of natural selection that can provide insight into the factors that explain phenotypic or ecological differences among species. a number of approaches have been employed in the literature to understand species divergence, including phenotypic selection experiments, quantitative trait locus studies, and genome-wide sequencing . together, they strongly implicate natural selection, not just genetic drift, as a prominent force in speciation and divergence. however, it is more complicated to explain the maintenance of species boundaries and ecological specialization in species that naturally hybridize. for example, even modest hybridization can break down species boundaries and lead to homogenization  <cit>  or maladaptation  <cit> , or it could facilitate the transfer of adaptive alleles among species  <cit> , among other possibilities  <cit> . one hypothesized explanation for the persistence of morphological and ecological distinctions among species despite hybridization is divergent natural selection at ecologically relevant genes, such as those involved in biotic or abiotic stress responses  <cit> . with current large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism  data sets among closely related species and classical molecular tests for selection, we now have the tools to test this hypothesis by revealing specific genes and functional classes of genes that are under divergent selection among lineages  <cit> .

the genus quercus  has long been recognized for its propensity to hybridize yet maintain ecological and morphological differentiation  <cit> , which has led to the proposal of the ecological species concept  <cit> . although pre-zygotic isolating mechanisms exist  <cit> , oaks frequently hybridize and species maintenance must be explained by other factors related to divergent selection in many cases  <cit> . our preliminary analyses identify genes under divergent selection among several california white oaks to test the hypothesis that selection by abiotic and biotic stresses contribute to ecological divergence and maintenance of oak species boundaries. we used our transcriptome-wide snps to estimate the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates  as evidence for divergent  or purifying  selection  <cit> , and fay and wu’s h as evidence for positive selection . in particular, we tested for functional classes of genes based on pfam annotations  <cit>  that showed the strongest evidence of divergent or positive selection among these ecologically distinct species.

RESULTS
transcriptome assembly
approximately 12– <dig> million 100-base paired-end reads per individual  and  <dig> million read pairs total  were obtained . adapter contamination was minimal . the insert size distribution was short enough that  <dig> million read pairs overlapped unambiguously and thus were merged, forming  <dig> gb of virtual single-end reads of 100– <dig> bases. the ray de novo assembler  <cit>  was used to assemble these and unmerged paired ends as a pool into a draft transcriptome of  <dig>  preliminary contigs of sizes 203– <dig>  bp totaling  <dig> mbp . approximately  <dig>  contigs of total  <dig> mbp were of size ≥  <dig> kbp, and a large number of the remaining contigs were quite short and of low coverage  and may be  low-expression genes, intron leakage , 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-utr extremes that tail off to low abundance or are shared by multiple genes, etc.

thousands of contig pairs were found to share intervals of ≥ 35 bp of exactly identical sequence away from regions masked by tandem repeats finder  <cit> . pairs of contigs whose ratio of average coverage differed by no more than 2: <dig> and that had only one uniquely aligning interval compatible with end-to-end joining were joined. thus, some  <dig>  k contigs of total ~ <dig> mbp were joined and replaced with ~ <dig>  k larger contigs of total ~ <dig> mbp. these joined contigs were found to be much enriched for compatibility with amino acid-coding open reading frames , such that often one model missing its 3ʹ-end was joined with one missing its 5ʹ-end. an effort was also made to identify over-merged contigs and split them, although a survey of likely coding regions suggested that over-joining was not prevalent .

the final number of contigs after merging and splitting was  <dig>   . the resulting  <dig>  mbp draft transcriptome is nearly 10 % of the total estimated oak genome sequence of  <dig> mbp  <cit>  and is comparable to, although somewhat larger than, the populus trichocarpa  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit>  transcriptomes.

assembly quality
our transcriptome assembly is of high quality and purity. first, almost all 100-mers in almost all transcriptome contigs are highly unique . thus, even though quercus has high genetic variation , it does not appear that many genic loci were multiply assembled . second, we found that 70–78 % of original read ends per individual mapped back to our assembled reference with mapping confidence ≥ 99 % , comparable to typical rna-seq experiments with established references. third, the c+g content  is consistent with that of other oaks  <cit>  and plants in general  <cit> . the distribution of c+g content across coding sequences, 5ʹ-utrs, and 3ʹ-utrs is distinct and descending across these groups, and are similar to arabidopsis . the oak transcriptome contigs lacking gene models, which are generally short and of low expression, have low c+g content similar to 3ʹ-utrs, consistent with being enriched for introns. in arabidopsis, introns also have low c+g content similar to 3ʹ-utrs  <cit> .

fourth, quercus is by far the dominant organism represented in the contigs and non-oak contamination is not prominent, both as determined by comparisons to known sequences , as well as the  <dig> contigs putatively identified as rrna used as indicators. one rrna contig had high-coverage, high-identity best match to the quercus rubra chloroplast, one to the gossypium hirsutum  mitochondrion , and the rest to bacterial sequences. however, of the  <dig>  million original reads that aligned to these known sequences, 87 % matched the q. rubra chloroplast, 11 % matched the cotton mitochondrion, and just 2 % matched the bacterial sequences. furthermore, percent identity tended to be about 99 % with the chloroplast or mitochondrial reads and considerably lower with the bacterial reads.

additionally, our californian oak  transcriptome contained many contigs in common with european q. robur est data and the eastern north american q. alba  <dig> est data , although our assembly consisted of more total contigs with twice the mean and maximum length . for example, 55 % of our california quercus contigs were found in q. robur ests, and 19 % were found in q. alba ests. in contrast, the proportions of q. robur  and q. alba  found in our quercus transcriptome are higher. together, these reciprocal comparisons indicate that the q. alba dataset is largely found within our quercus or the q. robur datasets, whereas the q. robur and our quercus datasets each contain many unique transcripts.

further indications of transcriptome quality and purity appear below.

repeats and transposons
only  <dig>  % of the transcriptome contig base pairs are marked as repetitive by repeatmasker, breaking down as 1 % long interspersed elements ,  <dig>  % ty1-copia and gypsy/dirs <dig> long terminal repeats ,  <dig>  % dna transposons ,  <dig>  % unclassified,  <dig>  % low complexity,  <dig>  % simple repeats, and  <dig>  % small rna. this overall percentage is comparable to a 454-based transcriptome assembly in pinus contorta, but much higher than that observed in many other est-based studies in plants  <cit> . line/ltr/dna-transposon containing contigs tended to be higher than average coverage, thus the large pool of low expression contigs  does not seem to be mostly from transposons or retroelements.

gene models and utrs
about  <dig>  k high-confidence, complete, single-exon gene models and  <dig> intron-containing models were selected from a preliminary glimmerhmm  <cit>  calling with arabidopsis parameters to bootstrap the augustus gene caller  <cit> . after re-training and re-running augustus, we explored coverage patterns in contigs containing tentative gene models. a random sampling of contigs as well as most of the  <dig> contigs that had more than one gene model showed expected coverage patterns. however,  <dig> contigs with multiple gene models showed sharp coverage discontinuities between models, suggesting such contigs were over-assembled fusions of multiple transcripts. these were split into separate contigs and final augustus runs made. the result is  <dig>  complete gene models,  <dig>  missing the 3′ end,  <dig>  missing the 5′ end, and  <dig>  internal fragments . all models total 28 m coding nucleotides. twenty-four percent of all models and nine percent of complete models contain introns, and only one percent of contigs with at least one gene model have multiple gene models. assuming that the  <dig>  partial gene models represent at least  <dig>  separate genes, then about  <dig>  total genes are represented in our bud/leaf/flower transcriptome — a number comparable to what one would expect from a given tissue at a given life stage in arabidopsis .

the amino acid usage and model length distributions compared favorably with a. thaliana tair <dig> genes  <cit>  . 5ʹ- and 3ʹ-utr lengths are reasonable, amounting to about 1/ <dig> of transcript lengths, but are slightly longer than in arabidopsis , perhaps due to the tendency for model organism projects to be somewhat conservative in utr annotation and quercus having a genome roughly six times the size of arabidopsis  <cit> . our oak draft transcriptome has 88 % of the complete protein count and 94 % of the partial protein count of core eukaryotic genes  found in populus trichocarpa, with 69–74 % of genes having orthologs. finally, an analysis based on reciprocal best hits with blastp alignments between six-frame contig translations and a large pool of ncbi proteins showed that the most common organisms closest to individual contigs of a draft version of the transcriptome were all plants, especially  vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa, glycine max, arabidopsis thaliana, ricinus communis, and medicago truncatula.

gene and domain annotation
we identified  <dig>  oak–arabidopsis gene pairs as being one-to-one orthologs . these were generally near-entire on both sides, with a mode of 70 % amino acid identity . oak contigs of low coverage and arabidopsis loci of low expression  are much less likely to have an orthologous pairing, but many of those at higher coverage levels are captured . additionally, 50 % of arabidopsis srx <dig> reads aligning to an arabidopsis gene are to genes with a called oak ortholog, suggesting the ortholog calls capture many commonly expressed genes. further, gene expression levels of orthologous pairs are correlated . in addition, the distribution of gene ontology  plant slim  <cit>  terms is comparable between all tair <dig> loci and those having a called quercus ortholog , demonstrating that the quercus transcriptome contains a representative and wide variety of genes. additional functional annotation is provided by ~ <dig>  hits to pfam from  <dig>  distinct oak gene models, with ~ <dig>  of the  <dig>  pfam accessions appearing at least once. these numbers are similar to a run on arabidopsis tair <dig> with the same parameters, resulting in ~ <dig>  hits to ~ <dig>  genes  with ~ <dig>  distinct pfam accessions appearing at least once.

variant calls
using a gatk-based pipeline  <cit> , we found ~ <dig>  million possible sequence variants when considering all  <dig> samples . after filtering and restricting only to snps, we found over  <dig>  million, of which  <dig>  % were diallelic,  <dig>  % were triallelic, and  <dig>  % were tetrallelic, with overall transition:transversion ratio of  <dig> . the filtered diallelic snp loci were used in subsequent analyses below. among only the  <dig> q. lobata samples, we identified about 900 k diallelic snps. our snp data set is the largest available in any quercus species  <cit>  and among the largest for trees .

the overall snp locus rate per base pair was  <dig>  % among all samples and  <dig>  % within q. lobata. such rates vary depending on organism, degree of sampling from a population, and depth of sequencing, but those here are generally consistent with studies in other plants  <cit> , including oaks   <cit> , but somewhat lower than arabidopsis that was sampled more broadly  <cit> . snp locus rates varied in patterns similar to those in an arabidopsis genomic study  <cit>  depending on whether the loci were within coding, intron, or utr sequence . the main difference seen can be explained by a drop in our power to detect variants at contig edges where coverage drops off . for orthologous genes among quercus and arabidopsis, nucleotide diversity at synonymous sites  within q. lobata was also consistent with other trees  <cit>  and plants in general  <cit> . nucleotide diversity is an unbiased estimate of the population mutation rate  and thus independent of sample size  <cit> , although it too depends somewhat on the ability to identify snps and accurately genotype, which in turn can depend on sample size and coverage. snps in gene model coding regions also led to amino acid change distributions consistent with those observed in arabidopsis  and organisms generally . further, genotype calls were largely in line with expectations under hardy-weinberg equilibrium . a number of factors can be attributed to the slight deviations seen from hardy-weinberg expectations, given the overly simplistic biological assumptions of that model. notably, where the deviations are largest is where there is by far the least data, thus at most loci the genotype frequency is consistent with expectations. overall, these comparisons suggest that the final list of called snp loci and associated genotypes are generally of high quality.

patterns of molecular evolution among species
overall, dn/ds ratios are well below unity  , suggesting a general influence of purifying selection in both oak species comparisons across most protein-coding regions, as has been observed in other plants  <cit> . the genes most under the influence of purifying selection  in both comparisons included primarily structural or “housekeeping” genes, such as tubulin, actin, histones, ubiquitin, elongation factors, and ribosomal proteins . this is also consistent with the contigs of highest expression having slightly lower snp locus rates than those of medium expression levels .fig.  <dig>

in sharp contrast, disease response, abiotic stress response, regulatory, and growth and flowering genes have among the highest dn/ds ratios. in the comparison of q. lobata to the outgroup q. garryana, genes containing  <dig> specific pfam accessions had significantly higher dn/ds at a threshold of q <  <dig>  compared to the background  , and in the comparison of the q. lobata–q. douglasii hybrid to q. garryana, genes containing  <dig> accessions have significantly higher ratios than the background genes, and these accessions largely overlapped with the former  <dig> . combined,  <dig> of  <dig> distinct pfam accessions associated with significantly high oak dn/ds ratios are directly linked to plant disease resistance and immune response in crop or model system plants. these especially include the tir  domain, the nb-arc signaling domain, the nacht domain , leucine-rich repeats , and f-box associated families . the rpw <dig> family, which confers broad-spectrum mildew resistance in arabidopsis  <cit> , also had high dn/ds . in all, at least  <dig> individual genes with evidence for involvement in disease resistance had dn/ds >  <dig>  of which  <dig> have go associations to biotic stress response  and  <dig> are members of gene families well-documented in the literature  . high dn/ds at disease resistance genes has also been observed in arabidopsis and other plants .table  <dig> abiotic or biotic stress response and flowering/seed development genes with d

within species, high genetic diversity at disease resistance genes is thought to play a role in conferring resistance to a broad diversity of pathogens and has been widely observed in plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit> . for example, pathogen pressure on common alleles can lead to positive selection for rare alleles, thus promoting diversity  <cit> . when biotic conditions change among populations or lineages, this underlying mechanism can continue, leading to diversifying selection among species for different alleles or suites of alleles. thus, our observation that disease response genes are under divergent selection is consistent with the general observation that diseases, parasites , and fungal associates  are often specific to particular plant species, including oaks . such pathogen pressure has been implicated as an important factor explaining biodiversity in tropical forests  <cit> .

the remaining pfam accessions associated with significantly high dn/ds are involved in a variety of functions. udpgt-containing genes are involved in pigment biosynthesis in plants as well as toxin removal in mammals. ppr  genes are involved in organelle biogenesis and bind chloroplast rna, suggesting a potential role in rna editing  <cit> . aaa  genes are involved in a variety of functions, especially signal transduction and gene expression regulation. f-box associated  genes perform diverse roles in plants, including flowering and growth regulation, self-incompatibility, leaf senescence, and various abiotic and biotic responses  <cit> . in addition, the s-locus glycoprotein  family related to self-incompatibility had significantly high dn/ds , and three specific genes containing copies of it had dn/ds >  <dig> . although variation at s-loci is often found to predate speciation  <cit> , the role of these loci in mating compatibility and reproduction gives them potential to be involved in divergence in some contexts. several other genes influencing floral and embryo development also had dn/ds >  <dig>  consistent with the idea that some reproductive elements might differ among species. finally, a number of abiotic response genes had high dn/ds, including those involved in light response , heat shock , and drought  .

to consider the possibility that high dn/ds ratios might be attributed to variant calling on paralogous gene copies, we examined observed heterozygosity  in high-dn/ds genes versus all other genes. paralogous gene copies are expected to diverge functionally and thus diverge at nonsynonymous sites  <cit> , representing a potential problem if we inadvertently calculated dn/ds for paralogs that were incorrectly collapsed to fewer copies during assembly. collapsed paralogs are expected to show high levels of apparent heterozygosity  because the “snps” would, in fact, largely be fixed differences among the gene copies present in every sample. reassuringly, we observe only a few ho >  <dig>  and no substantive difference between ho in high-dn/ds genes and most other genes , indicating that few if any genes represent collapsed paralogs. thus, the signal of divergent selection that we observe is likely real for the identified pfam accessions and for most genes.fig.  <dig> mean observed heterozygosity per gene. histograms of mean observed heterozygosity  for each gene containing pfam accessions with significantly high d

as complementary tests of positive selection in q. lobata relative to its ancestor with q. garryana, we calculated for each gene fay and wu’s h, which is expected to have negative values under positive selection  <cit> . we did not find any class of genes defined by the pfam accessions they contained to have unusually negative or positive h  . however,  <dig>  genes have low values , and  <dig> individual genes have very low values , suggestive of positive selection . among all these,  <dig> also had dn/ds >  <dig>  of which  <dig> likely play a role in abiotic or biotic stress response: light-harvesting complex of photosystem ii  <dig> , k+ transporter , late embryogenesis abundant  hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family , and an aaa domain-containing protein  . the strongest evidence for positive selection is for light-harvesting complex of photosystem ii  <dig>  which has both very high dn/ds  and low h. however, there was no overall correlation of dn/ds with h . given our limited sampling, our primary goal was to identify functional classes of genes under positive selection, and it appears that the signal in h is not strong enough to independently confirm the dn/ds results.

in summary, we found preliminary support for divergent selection on biotic and abiotic stress response genes based on dn/ds, consistent with the hypothesis that ecological forces are important in the divergence and potentially in the maintenance of species boundaries in california oaks. identifying the classes of genes under divergent selection provides insight into the factors most strongly involved in divergence among these hybridizing taxa, but warrants future direct investigation of the role of ecological factors in speciation and maintenance of species boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a draft transcriptome for several california oaks that includes transcript contig nucleotide sequences, gene models , and functional associations based on pfam domain occurrences and gene orthologs with arabidopsis. although understandably not at the quality of a model organism, this transcriptome appears to be a large representative fraction of transcribed loci in quercus and is the most complete for this genus reported to date. many gene models are of good quality and complete, many transcripts correspond to exactly one gene, and individual genes are generally not multiply assembled, even though quercus has relatively high genetic variation across individuals. we further identified over  <dig>  million high-quality diallelic snp loci and genotyped  <dig> individuals, representing the largest snp resource available in quercus  <cit>  and among the highest for any tree . this transcriptome provides a solid foundation for studies of genetic variation and gene expression in quercus, and will enable research in comparative genomics, phylogeography, hybridization, adaptation genomics, and quantitative genetics in oaks.

by investigating patterns of nonsynonymous and synonymous snp variation among classes of genes among species, we found preliminary support that biotic stress is a major factor in divergent evolution among oak species. by implication, selection for stress response could contribute to the maintenance of species boundaries among these hybridizing species. future work that includes more species and codon-level analyses, as well as studies of genomic patterns of introgression along hybrid zones, will shed more light on the specific loci that are most important in speciation, species integrity, and adaptation.
