BACKGROUND
clubroot, caused by the biotrophic protist plasmodiophora brassicae woronin, is one of the most serious diseases of brassica crops worldwide  <cit> . in western canada, clubroot disease has become a major threat to the production of canola   <cit> , where more than 8 m ha of canola crops are grown annually  <cit> . the pathogen is able to survive for up to 20 years in soil  <cit>  and many conventional disease-management measures, including cultural techniques and application of fungicides, are not effective  <cit> . genetic resistance is the most effective and economical approach to clubroot management on canola. european fodder turnips  are the major source of clubroot-resistance  genes, which have been introduced into other brassica crops including oilseed rape , rutabaga  and chinese cabbage  .

since  <dig>  several resistant  canola cultivars have been released in canada, and all of them carry a single dominant cr gene. the source and genetic information are not revealed for these cr genes  <cit> . the durability of these clubroot r cultivars remains unknown in western canada, but resistance conferred by a single gene is generally not durable. breakdown of clubroot resistance has been reported on chinese cabbage  <cit>  and oilseed rape  <cit> . a resistant canola cultivar showed substantially increased clubroot severity after being exposed to pathotype  <dig> of p. brassicae after only two cycles under controlled conditions  <cit> . rotation or pyramiding of cr genes with different mechanisms of resistance may be used to increase the durability of clubroot resistance if a diverse group of cr genes can be identified and their resistance mechanisms characterized. our prior work evaluated  <dig> brassica accessions and identified a range of cr candidates from b. rapa, b. nigra and b. oleracea <cit> .

most of the known cr genes have been identified from b. rapa, with eight loci reported previously: crr <dig>  crr <dig>  crr <dig>  crr <dig>  cra, crb, crc and crk. cra and crr <dig> have been isolated recently  <cit> . another cr gene, rpb <dig>  was identified from arabidopsis thaliana ecotype tsu- <dig>  <cit> , but there has been no further report on its orthlogs in other arabidopsis ecotypes. a new cr gene  was identified recently from the cv. flower nabana  of pak choy  via rough mapping  <cit> . rpb <dig> is identical to rcr1described in this paper, and the name change was to avoid potential confusion with the rpb <dig> from arabidopsis. there has been little information on molecular mechanisms associated with any of the cr genes reported. in a. thaliana, host metabolism was altered by p. brassicae infection; transcriptome studies based on microarray analysis showed that genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism were upregulated in root tissues of the susceptible  col- <dig> ecotype  <cit> , but not in moderately resistant  ecotypes which appeared to reduce or delay pathogen-triggered metabolic diversion and cell enlargement or proliferation in the host  <cit> . reduced trehalose and arginine metabolism were also reported with the partially resistant a. thaliana ecotype bur- <dig> when compared with that in a susceptible ecotype  <cit> . secondary metabolism, including flavonoids, may also contribute to formation of characteristic club symptoms in arabidopsis, and inhibition of oxoglutaric acid-dependent dioxygenases reduced club development  <cit> . treatment with the phytohormone salicylic acid or biofungicides reduced clubroot development on a. thaliana and b. napus via activation of several defense-related pathways in the hosts . however, there is no information on molecular mechanisms of clubroot resistance in brassica species based on transcriptome analysis. rna sequencing  has been employed recently to elucidate resistance mechanisms involved in plant-pathogen interactions including sclerotinia homoeocarpea-creeping bentgrass  <cit>  and phytophthora infestans-potato tuber  <cit> .

in the present study, we intended to: 1) identify and characterize the cr gene from a highly resistant pak choy cultivar using genetic mapping; 2) develop molecular markers closely linked to this cr gene to facilitate marker-assisted selection  at the young seedling stage; and 3) analyze the global transcriptome profile associated with the cr gene based on rna-seq. we examined differential gene expression between r and s f <dig> plants, and the result provided important insights into the molecular mechanisms of clubroot resistance. this work also sets the first step toward the development of canola germplasm using cr genes with potentially different modes of action against clubroot.

RESULTS
the clubroot resistance in cv. fn is associated with a single dominant allele
all of the fn plants were resistant to pathotype  <dig> of p. brassicae, showing no clubroot symptom at 5 weeks after inoculation, whereas all of the acdc plants were susceptible . analyses of the f <dig> populations from reciprocal crosses showed a segregation pattern that would fit a 1: <dig> ratio between r and s plants , indicating that the resistance in fn is associated with a single dominant nuclear gene. this gene was designated as rcr <dig> . also, the pattern of clubroot disease response in parental and f <dig> populations  indicated that the rcr <dig> locus was likely heterozygous in the cv. fn.figure  <dig>

rcr <dig> was roughly mapped to a range of  <dig>  cm in the b. rapa linkage group a <dig> flanked by the markers sn <dig> and sr6340i , and fine mapping was based on testing additional  <dig>  f <dig> plants using pathotype  <dig> of p. brassicae and on analysis using these flanking markers . the flanked segment is homologous to the region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on the a <dig> , with  <dig> genes annotated  and five of them  identified as encoding toll interleukin- <dig> receptor - nucleotide-binding site -leucine-rich repeat  class of proteins . bra <dig> is located close to  <dig>  mb and the rest were in a cluster located between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb.figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> recombinants were identified via comparison of marker and phenotype data over the  <dig>  f <dig> plants , with  <dig> falling between sn <dig> and rcr <dig> and  <dig> between rcr1and sr6340i. a caps marker , homologous to bra <dig> at  <dig>  mb, was developed for further analysis of the  <dig> recombinants, and showed an approximate distance of  <dig>  cm from rcr <dig>  which was closer to the cr gene than sr6340i. the interval flanked by sn <dig> and a3- <dig> was estimated at  <dig>  cm, consisting of approximately  <dig> kb with  <dig> genes annotated . the caps marker ms7- <dig>  was identified slightly later and appeared even closer to rcr <dig> than a3- <dig> . based on the rate of recombination, the genetic distance of rcr <dig> was estimated at  <dig>  cm from sn <dig> and  <dig>  cm from ms7- <dig>  respectively. the cluster of four tir-nbs-lrr genes and one defense-related gene  are located also within this interval. the gene ontology  terms for these genes are in table  <dig> and figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

transcriptome profiling based on rna-seq
inoculated f <dig> seedlings from the cross acdc × fn were bulked  based on mas and examined for global transcriptomes using rna-seq. approximately  <dig> million raw reads were generated from a total of six pooled samples. about 92% of them passed the quality control standard, yielding  <dig> million of clean reads . about 60% of the total reads were mapped to the b. rapa reference genome, with 97% of them being uniquely mapped, while 33% of the total reads were unmapped.table  <dig>

a total of  <dig>  genes were annotated in the b. rapa reference genome sequence . transcripts of  <dig>  of these genes were detected based on rpkm calculations , and among them, more than 75%  had a coverage of 90% or higher by the mapped reads. a total of  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  were identified in this study , with  <dig>  genes upregulated and  <dig> down-regulated in the r samples relative to s samples. almost all genes in the fine mapped rcr <dig> region between  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb of a <dig> were expressed, but only a few of them were identified as degs and most of them showed no difference in expression levels between inoculated r and s. interestingly, two of the tir-nbs-lrr genes  within this region were significantly upregulated in the inoculated r treatment relative to the inoculated s treatment.

rt-qpcr analysis of  <dig> selected genes over the same r and s bulk samples showed a trend consistent with that of rpkm calculations and statistical analyses of transcript data . the rt-qpcr data confirmed up-regulation of a class- <dig> non-symbiotic hemoglobin , erd <dig> protein , protein tify 10a , s-adenosyl-l-methionine:carboxyl methyltransferase family protein , transcriptional factor bhlb92-like protein  and transcriptional factor bhlh <dig>  genes in resistant samples detected via rna-seq. the data also verified down-regulation of a chitinase-like protein , ralf-like  <dig> protein , endochitinase isolog  and cell-wall-protein-like protein  genes  as indicated in rna-seq analysis.figure  <dig>

annotation of degs
the degs were functionally annotated based on go terms  and sorted into the go-term biological process, molecular function and cellular component  using blast2go  <cit> . the statistics for go-term mapping were provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  a total of  <dig> degs retrieved no hits with blast .

the annotated degs with upregulated patterns in r samples fell mainly into  <dig> categories of biological process . the go term “defense response”  was also one of the major categories identified. other upregulated biological processes of go terms included signal transduction, various metabolic/biosynthetic processes and regulation of metabolic processes.

for molecular functions, several cellular-component go terms were identified, especially those associated with the plasma membrane representing the largest group .

the go terms for biological processes associated with down-regulated degs were mostly in the category of “anatomical-structural and multicellular-organismal development”  and “regulation of primary metabolic process”. most of the molecular functional go terms associated with down-regulated degs were in the same categories as those of upregulated degs, although several unique terms were identified, including sequence-specific dna binding transcription factor activity, hydrolase activity on o-glycosyl compounds, substrate-specific trans-membrane transporter activity, and nucleoside-triphosphatase activity . similarly, the majority of cellular-component go terms of down-regulated degs fell into categories similar to those of upregulated degs, with only three new go terms observed: vacuole, chloroplast stromal and organelle membrane .figure  <dig>

transcription factors  were also characterized broadly for degs; a total of  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> down-regulated degs were grouped into seven types of tf, based on their conserved structures. for upregulated degs,  <dig> of them belong to wrky,  <dig> are myb domain-containing tfs,  <dig> are ethylene -responsive tfs,  <dig> are bhlh-domain containing tfs,  <dig> belong to the ap2/erf family,  <dig> are heat-stress related tfs, and the remaining  <dig> belong to “other” tf families . for down-regulated degs,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of them fell into the respective tf families .table  <dig>

biological-process go terms for up- and down-regulated degs
analysis using the fisher’s exact test in blast2go identified the enrichment associated with up- and down-regulated degs; a total of  <dig> biological-process go terms displayed significant enrichment , with  <dig> of them associated with upregulated and  <dig> with down-regulated degs. most of these enriched go terms were related to “responses”, including those to chemical and hormone stimuli. the results were similar for metabolic-process go terms, with most of the enriched term being related to “responses”. among  <dig> enriched go terms for upregulated degs,  <dig> were related to lipid metabolism, including lipid metabolic process, cellular lipid metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, oxylipin metabolism and biosynthesis. several go terms related to defense-related phytohormones, including jasmonic acid and ethylene, but not salicylic acid , were also highly enriched in inoculated r plants relative to those in inoculated s plants . a total of  <dig> degs were annotated under go terms with sa-related biological processes, including “response to sa stimulus”, “sa biosynthetic process “systemic acquired resistance, sa-mediated signaling pathway” etc. , but none of them was significantly enriched in either up- or down-regulated go terms, as determined with the fisher’s exact test. noticeably, genes associated with several common defense responses were significantly upregulated, including “callose deposition”, “defense response by callose deposition” and “indole-containing compound metabolic process”. in contrast, most of the biological-process go terms enriched in down-regulated degs were related to “development” and “morphogenesis”, including developmental process, anatomical structure development, anatomical structure morphogenesis and uni-dimensional cell growth .figure  <dig>

transcript analysis of selected defence-related degs using rt-qpcr
based on rna-seq analysis,  <dig> strongly upregulated and  <dig> strongly down-regulated degs , involved possibly in resistance based on the functional annotation , were subjected to rt-qpcr analysis. all of the  <dig> upregulated degs displayed similar transcriptional patterns; the transcript levels, based on their relative quantity, were comparable for r and s plants without pathogen inoculation but significantly higher in r plants after inoculation . the  <dig> down-regulated degs, however, showed different transcriptional patterns; bra <dig> and bra <dig> displayed comparable transcript levels in non-inoculated s and r plants but these genes were significantly induced by p. brassicae in s plants and suppressed in r plants . bra <dig> and bra <dig> did not show significant induction by the pathogen in s plants relative to those in non-inoculated s or r plants, but suppressed in inoculated r plants . two of the tir-nbs-lrr genes  residing in the rcr <dig> region were also identified as degs in the rna-seq, but were not included in the rt-qpcr test due to only moderate rpkm values. preliminary rt-qpcr trials on degs with moderate rpkm showed unsatisfactory amplification .figure  <dig>

discussion
mapping of the rcr1gene and development of genetic markers
the cr gene rcr <dig>  was mapped previously to a genomic region in the linkage group a <dig> flanked by the markers sn <dig> and sr6340i  <cit> . additional markers were developed in the current study using the b. rapa genome information, with the markers a3- <dig> and ms7- <dig> being much closer to the cr gene than sr6340i. several markers were highly accurate in detecting rcr <dig> in both b. rapa and b. napus plants, especially when two flanking markers were used together. these markers will be useful for mas in resistance breeding. rcr <dig> is the only cr gene reported in pak choy , but the original source of the gene is not known. most of the cr genes identified in chinese cabbage  originated from european turnip  <cit> . four cr genes have been mapped previously to the linkage group a <dig>  including cra <cit> , crb <cit> , crk <cit>  and crr <dig> <cit> . cra has also been cloned recently  <cit> . based on the relationship between common markers and the location of these cr loci, diederichsen et al. <cit>  suggested that cra and crr <dig> are identical, allelic or at least closely linked to crb and crk. recent work also indicated that crb is likely in the same position as cra, and both genes conferred resistance to pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig> but not to pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig> of p. brassicae <cit> . based on the linkage distance, rcr <dig> is close to both cra and crb. however, the cv. fn which carries rcr <dig> is highly resistant to both pathotypes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , suggesting a different resistance spectrum from that of cra or crb.

the mechanisms for clubroot resistance are not well understood. among the  <dig> genes annotated within the region defined by sn <dig> and a3- <dig> , four tir-nbs-lrr genes can be located . the protein family containing nbs and lrr domains is the largest class of r genes cloned so far  <cit> . cra and crr <dig> isolated from b. rapa also encode tir-nbs-lrr proteins  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that rcr <dig> is one or a cluster of these tir-nbs-lrr genes in the mapped region.

transcriptome analysis and go annotation of degs
transcriptome profiling can provide insights into the mechanisms of disease resistance. this approach has been used to characterize several molecular components associated with clubroot disease development, especially the role of cytokinins on a. thaliana <cit>  and b. juncea <cit> . however, no comparative analysis of gene transcription between clubroot resistant and susceptible plants was available. in our study, transcripts of  <dig>  genes were analyzed via rna-seq and  <dig>  degs were identified between inoculated r and s plants. this number of degs is comparable to that observed in a previous transcriptome analysis between rosette and folding leaves of chinese cabbage  <cit> . fifty degs retrieved no hit in a blast search , indicating a number of unknown genes expressed in inoculated r plants. the go terms “defense response”  and “plasma membrane”  accounted for a substantial portion of upregulated degs. some of these genes may be candidates for further studies of clubroot resistance, because the plasma membrane is where most plant-pathogen interaction occurs   <cit> . additionally, a large proportion of upregulated degs were annotated with the go term biological process involved in responses to external stimuli  and many of these go terms were also significantly enriched for upregulated degs . these results indicate that many cellular activities in inoculated r plants were significantly upregulated at  <dig> dpi when root infection and pathogen colonization were taking place . it also appears that infection may have caused differential activation or deactivation of certain genes in the host that may affect clubroot development on resistant and/or susceptible plants.

the enrichment analysis identified go terms for biological process associated with both upregulated and down-regulated degs. several lipid compounds were implied to play a role in the inoculated r plants. lipids have been shown to play critical roles in detecting infection and may also have a key role in regulating gene transcription  <cit> . during infection by p. brassicae, the r plants appeared to be able to mobilize lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, because several genes involved in oxylipin biosynthetic and metabolic processes, including bra <dig>  bra <dig> and bra <dig>  were upregulated substantially . one group of the most intensively studied oxylipins is jasmonates, likely due to their involvement in multiple plant biological processes  <cit> . go terms associated with “response to jasmonic acid  stimulus”, “ja metabolic process” and “ja biosynthetic process” were significantly enriched within the group of upregulated degs . this possibly indicates that jasmonates have a role in clubroot resistance mediated by rcr <dig>  prost et al.  <cit>  employed in vitro growth inhibition assays to evaluate  <dig> natural oxylipins and found that  <dig> of them had inhibitory effects on a wide range of plant pathogens. similarly, jasmonates appear to play a role in induced resistance to clubroot caused by biofungicides  <cit> . oxylipins may also be used by both host and pathogen as regulatory compounds during the host-pathogen interaction   <cit> . further work is needed to confirm the specific role of oxylipins in clubroot resistance.

potential molecular mechanisms for clubroot resistance
several clubroot-resistance mechanisms identified previously were supported in the current study. for example, genes involved in olefin  metabolic and biosynthetic processes and in response to et stimulus, were upregulated in plants carrying rcr <dig> . et had previously been shown to restrict club development in a. thaliana <cit>  and to have a role in induced resistance mediated by biofungicides  <cit> . this result supports the current opinion that ja and et may act synergistically in plant defense  <cit> . reinforcement of plant cell wall was also indicated based on the enrichment of go terms for upregulated degs associated with callose localization and deposition . the role of callose has been well documented in resistance to penetration of plant cell wall by fungal pathogens  <cit> . in arabidopsis, genes encoding the synthesis of β- <dig>  glucan  were suppressed in a compatible interaction between p. brassicae and susceptible ecotype col- <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, the gene bra <dig>  encoding an expansin-like protein , showed the highest increase in transcript among all  <dig>  degs upregulated. this may indicate a structural/composition alteration to the cell wall, which could affect secondary infection in epidermal and cortical cells. some of the above-mentioned defense-related degs were analyzed further with rt-qpcr using inoculated and non-inoculated plants to determine transcript levels as affected by p. brassicae . the results demonstrated that the inoculation increased the expression of these genes in both s and r plants. inoculated r plants, however, showed significantly stronger expression of these genes relative to inoculated s plants. this result is consistent with that of rna-seq. in addition, genes involved in synthesis of indole-containing compounds were also upregulated in r seedlings. the anti-microbial compounds derived from this metabolic process typically include tryptophan-derived metabolites  <cit>  and flavonoids converted from aromatic-acid phenylalanine  <cit> . these indicate potential involvement of secondary metabolites in clubroot resistance. although several common resistance mechanisms are identified with rna-seq, further analysis is needed to assess the relative importance of each mechanism in clubroot resistance conferred by rcr <dig> 

as described above, rcr <dig> may encode a tir-nbs-lrr protein. the best characterized defense signaling pathway related to this class of r proteins involves the biosynthesis of salicylic acid  and pathogenesis-related  proteins, accompanied typically by a hypersensitive reaction   <cit> . additionally, sa biosynthesis is linked frequently to host resistance against biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . in the current study, however, go terms related to sa biosynthesis, metabolism or signaling processes were not significantly up-/down-regulated based on the enrichment analysis. this lack of substantial change in transcription of genes involved in sa biosynthesis has also been observed with induced resistance against clubroot on canola  <cit> . previous reports have suggested hr as one of the possible mechanisms for clubroot resistance  <cit> , but only two upregulated degs, i.e., bra <dig>  and bra <dig>  were identified as pr genes based on go annotation  in the current study and there is no experimental evidence to link any of them to sa- or hr-related defense responses. in a cytological observation, deora et al. found no evidence of hr with clubroot resistant canola cultivars  <cit> . it is possible that sa signaling pathways may not play a critical role in clubroot resistance.

another mechanism for disease resistance is suppression of metabolic processes in the host that are required for pathogenesis. previous research had demonstrated that the level of auxin  increased in roots during secondary infection by p. brassicae, likely as the result of enhanced biosynthesis and conversion of host auxin precursors induced by the pathogen  <cit> . in the current study, bra <dig>  which encodes a saur family of proteins, was among the most highly induced genes  in r plants relative to s plants. saur proteins are closely linked to auxin biosynthesis and signaling  <cit> . for example, saur <dig> had been found to be a negative regulator of auxin biosynthesis and transport in rice  <cit> . with clubroot, pathogen-induced auxin metabolism had been linked to pathogenesis in arabidopsis  <cit> . additionally, several genes encoding the auxin-responsive gh <dig> family of proteins were upregulated in r plants. the gh <dig> family has been linked with increased basal immunity via suppressing pathogen-induced auxin accumulation in rice  <cit> . in addition to manipulating plant auxin homeostasis, over-expression of gh <dig>  in an activation-tagged mutant of arabidopsis displayed enhanced biosynthesis of camalexin, the major phytoalexin found with pathogen infection in arabidopsis  <cit> . since the biosynthesis of camalexin and auxin were derived from the common precursor tryptophan  <cit> , the metabolic stream may have been redirected to flow into the biosynthesis of phytoalexin from auxin in the r plants. taken together, the results indicate that pathogen-activated auxin synthesis might have been suppressed or disrupted in r plants.

most of the enriched go terms associated with down-regulated degs were related to growth and development, including cell cycle, uni-dimensional cell growth, anatomical structure morphogenesis, and cell morphogenesis . down-regulation of these genes may play a role in the resistance mediated by rcr <dig> because hypertrophy, the most typical symptom of clubroot  <cit> , is related positively to these physiological activities. expression of genes involved in cell enlargement and proliferation was inhibited in an arabidopsis line partially resistant to p. brassicae, relative to the susceptible reaction  <cit> . in the current study, two of the genes  annotated for the go term “uni-dimensional cell growth” were upregulated by the pathogen in inoculated s plants , as opposed to the same genes in inoculated r plants that changed little relative to those in non-inoculated plants. down-regulation of these degs possibly works in conjunction with up-regulation of defense-related genes described above in resulting in a resistant outcome in plants carrying rcr <dig>  it is not clear if down-regulation of growth/development degs is directly related to the suppression of auxin-dependent metabolism via enhanced expression of bra <dig> or gh <dig> genes observed. however, the evidence indicates that one or more processes related to auxin biosynthesis and cell growth/development are disrupted in r plants, with infection by p. brassicae.

rna-seq analysis revealed that the clubroot resistance conferred by rcr <dig> involves complex mechanisms via a variety of biological processes controlled likely by corresponding transcription factors . as expected,  <dig> upregulated degs were identified based on their conserved structures as tfs responsible for activation of several biological processes potentially involved in disease resistance . consistent with the roles of et and ja discussed above, et-responsive tfs including the ap2/erf-family tfs   <cit>  and bhlh-family tfs   <cit>  were upregulated to relatively high levels . wrky-family tfs were also upregulated. their involvement in disease resistance, including effector-triggered immunity, has been suggested previously  <cit> . myb-family proteins may be involved in secondary metabolism including flavonoid  <cit>  and secondary cell-wall biosynthesis  <cit> . these biological functions may contribute to clubroot resistance by generating anti-microbial metabolites and strengthening host cell walls. several heat-stress and “other” types of tfs were also identified, but their role in resistance is not understood. it is interesting that no heat-stress tfs were identified in the down-regulated degs, but the significance of this observation is unclear. only a small number of defense-related degs were present in the  <dig> down-regulated degs sorted into the tf groups. the other down-regulated degs in tf groups are involved generally in cellular growth and development. in other words, these down-regulated tfs may represent targets that p. brassicae up-regulates during pathogenesis in s plants.

CONCLUSIONS
genetic resistance is the cornerstone for management of clubroot on canola. in this study, we characterized the cr gene rcr <dig>  based on genetic mapping and transcript analysis, to develop markers for mas and decipher molecular mechanisms of resistance associated with rcr <dig>  rna-seq analysis identified a range of biological processes potentially involved in clubroot resistance, consisting of both up-regulated defense-related and suppressed pathogenesis-related responses. this information is highly useful to design a breeding strategy based on modes of action of cr genes to achieve strong and durable clubroot resistance. although sa biosynthesis is often linked to plant resistance against biotrophic pathogens, genes involved in sa biosynthetic pathways were not activated in inoculated plants carrying rcr <dig>  in contrast, genes involved in ja/et and callose biosynthesis were upregulated substantially. the biosynthesis or signaling of ja/et has not been identified previously for resistance to clubroot. further research is needed to confirm specific roles of these phytohormones in clubroot resistance mediated by rcr <dig>  it will also be useful to look at these phytohormones in association with other cr genes.
