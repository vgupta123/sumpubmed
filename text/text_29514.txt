BACKGROUND
the photosynthetic apparatus of photosynthetic eukaryotic cells is the product of two genetic systems -- the nucleus-cytoplasm and the plastid. nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins usually have an n-terminal targeting sequence and are translated on cytoplasmic  <dig> s ribosomes as precursors; import into the organelle is accompanied by removal of the "transit" peptide to generate the mature protein . the chloroplast genome, on the other hand, has many prokaryotic-like features - a remnant of the endosymbiotic origin of these organelles  <cit> . chloroplast dna-encoded proteins are translated on prokaryote-like  <dig> s ribosomes, usually in their mature forms, and assemble with nuclear-encoded counterparts to form a given multisubunit complex. the coordination and integration of the expression of nuclear and plastid genes involve both anterograde  and retrograde  regulatory signals that are elicited in response to endogenous cues, such as developmental signals, and exogenous cues, such as light  <cit> .

variegation mutants are ideal models for studying the mechanisms of chloroplast biogenesis. the arabidopsis variegation <dig>  mutant displays green and white/yellow patches in normally green organs. the green sectors contain morphologically normal chloroplasts while the white sectors contain abnormal plastids that lack chlorophyll and contain underdeveloped lamellar structures  <cit> . the variegation phenotype of var <dig> is a recessive trait and is caused by the loss of a nuclear gene product for an ftsh atp-dependent metalloprotease that is targeted to chloroplast thylakoid membranes  <cit> .

the function of ftsh-like proteases is best understood in escherichia coli and yeast mitochondria where they play a central role in protein quality control and cellular homeostasis  <cit> . ftsh is thought to play similar roles in photosynthetic organisms, inasmuch as it is involved in turnover of damaged or unassembled proteins, including the photosystem ii  reaction center d <dig> protein  <cit> , the cytochrome b6f rieske fes protein  <cit> , light harvesting complex ii  <cit> , and in cyanobacteria, unassembled psii subunits  <cit> . ftsh proteins have also been implicated in membrane fusion and/or translocation events  <cit> , the n-gene mediated hypersensitive response to pathogen attack  <cit> , heat stress tolerance  <cit> , and light signal transduction  <cit> .

if var <dig> is required for chloroplast biogenesis, as evident by the formation of white sectors in var <dig>  an intriguing question is how some cells of the mutant are able to bypass the requirement for var <dig> and form functional chloroplasts, despite having a var <dig> genetic background. a threshold model has been proposed to explain the mechanism of variegation in var <dig>  <cit> . this model is based on the observation that leaf cells of var <dig> are heteroplastidic, i.e. each of the many plastids in an individual cell acts in autonomous manner  <cit> , and assumes that there is a fluctuating level of ftsh activity required for chloroplast function that reflects different micro-physiological conditions of individual developing plastids. in wild-type and the green sectors of var <dig>  it is hypothesized that above-threshold levels of ftsh activity are present, and that these are sufficient for normal chloroplast development. below-threshold activities, on the other hand, are not sufficient for chloroplast biogenesis and condition the formation of non-pigmented plastids. our working hypothesis is that the green sectors of var <dig> have compensating factors/activities that either promote ftsh levels/activities or lower the ftsh threshold needed for chloroplast biogenesis. for example, the var <dig> homolog atftsh <dig> is a compensating factor  <cit> .

to further dissect var <dig> function and to identify the factors/activities that enable normal chloroplast biogenesis in the absence of var <dig>  we and others have carried out genetic screens for second-site var <dig> suppressors  <cit> . to date, a handful of suppressor mutants have been characterized at the molecular level . surprisingly, a majority of these have defects in the linked processes of chloroplast rrna processing and chloroplast translation  <cit> . this argues for a linkage between var <dig> and these processes. it is also worth noting that the various suppressor lines have distinct accumulation patterns of chloroplast  <dig> s rrna, suggesting that rrna processing defects may not be a secondary effect of perturbed chloroplast function, but rather that they are a consequence of disruption of specific regulatory steps governing chloroplast rrna processing  <cit> .

in this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a var <dig> suppressor line designated tag- <dig>  we show that suppression of var <dig> in this line is caused by disruption of svr <dig>  a gene that encodes a chloroplast homolog of the e. coli typa translation elongation factor. typa is a member of the translation elongation factor superfamily of gtpases  <cit> . we show that svr <dig> single mutants and the tag- <dig> double mutants  have minor chloroplast rrna processing defects and a moderate reduction of chloroplast protein accumulation at 22°c, with the exception of a sharp reduction in the level of photosystem ii d <dig> protein. interestingly, the svr <dig> single mutant has a chilling sensitive phenotype: at 22°c, it is pale green; while at 8°c it is chlorotic and has greatly reduced amounts of chlorophyll, aberrant chloroplast rrna accumulation and processing, and abnormal chloroplast protein accumulation. our findings suggest that svr <dig> is involved in proper chloroplast rrna processing and/or translation at low temperature. taken together, the data presented here strengthen the link between var <dig> function and chloroplast translation. furthermore, the chilling sensitive phenotype of svr <dig> provides more evidence that higher plant chloroplasts are intimately involved in the response of plants to chilling stress.

RESULTS
phenotype of a var <dig> suppressor line, tag-11
we have previously identified var <dig> suppressors via ethyl methanesulfonate  mutagenesis  <cit>  and t-dna activation tagging  <cit> . in this report, we describe a t-dna-tagged var <dig> suppressor designated tag- <dig> . analyses of f <dig> and f <dig> progeny from a cross between tag- <dig>  and var2- <dig> indicated that the suppression phenotype in tag- <dig> is due to a recessive mutation that co-segregates with a complex t-dna insertion pattern at a single locus . we named this locus suppressor of variegation <dig> , and the allele in tag- <dig> was designated svr3- <dig>  to isolate svr3- <dig> single mutants, tag- <dig>  was backcrossed to wild-type arabidopsis and the genotype of the var <dig> locus in the f <dig> progeny of the backcross was determined using derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  primers  <cit> . figure 1a shows that tag- <dig> is smaller than wild-type and has pale green leaves due to significantly less chlorophyll than normal . tag- <dig> is also slightly variegated at later developmental stages. on the other hand, most of the phenotypes of svr3- <dig> are intermediate between those of tag- <dig> and wild-type, including size, extent of variegation and chlorophyll content . the exception is chlorophyll a/b ratios , which are lower in svr3- <dig> than in the other lines. these observations are in contrast to other reported var <dig> suppressor lines, in which the svr single mutants and the suppressor lines have very similar phenotypes and the suppressor lines do not display visible variegation  <cit> . this suggests that the genetic interaction between var <dig> and svr <dig> is more complex than the epistatic relationships we have observed before.

identification of svr3
the suppression of var2- <dig> leaf variegation in tag- <dig> is linked with t-dna insertion events, suggesting that the suppressor phenotype is likely caused by t-dna insertions . but due to the complexity of these events, plasmid rescue attempts were not successful in cloning svr <dig> . as an alternative approach, we used positional cloning to delimit the svr <dig> locus to a ~ <dig> kb interval on chromosome  <dig> using a series of molecular markers we designed using the cereon genomics indel and snp databases . we reasoned that mutations that can cause suppression of var <dig> likely affect nuclear genes encoding chloroplast proteins. six such genes reside in the ~ <dig> kb interval. because the mutation in tag- <dig> is probably a complex t-dna insertion, pcr using primers flanking wild-type genomic fragments containing the t-dna insertion should fail to amplify wild-type sized fragments. using this method we determined that at5g <dig> is the gene bearing the mutation: as illustrated in figures 2a and 2b, primers f <dig> and r1- <dig> failed to amplify a wild-type sized fragment of this gene from the mutant genomic dna. the other five genes, by contrast, gave rise to wild-type sized fragments using other sets of primers to amplify tag- <dig> genomic dna. we further found that primers f1- <dig> and r <dig> amplified the same wild-type sized fragments with either tag- <dig> or wild-type genomic dna , suggesting that the t-dna insertion in at5g <dig> likely resides between primers f <dig> and f1- <dig>  figure 2c shows that transcripts bearing the entire predicted coding region of at5g <dig> are not detectable in tag- <dig> by rt-pcr, suggesting that svr3- <dig> is a molecular null allele and offering further confirmation that at5g <dig> is the suppressor gene. although our data indicate that at5g <dig> is disrupted by t-dna insertion in tag- <dig>  we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the complex t-dna insertion pattern in tag- <dig> is a result of several individual insertion events at closely linked loci.

identification of svr3- <dig>  a second allele of svr3
to verify that at5g <dig> is the suppressor gene in tag- <dig>  we searched for a second mutant allele from publicly available collections of t-dna insertion mutants http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress. one line  was reported to have a t-dna insertion in the 10th exon of the gene  <cit> . the site of this insertion was verified by pcr followed by sequencing and the allele was designated svr3- <dig> ; homozygous svr3- <dig> plants resemble svr3- <dig> plants . semi-quantitative rt-pcr shows that the transcript of at5g <dig> was not detectable in svr3- <dig> seedlings . we also obtained svr3- <dig> var2- <dig> double mutants, and found that var <dig> variegation is suppressed in these plants . the svr3- <dig> var2- <dig> double mutants are also paler and smaller than svr3- <dig> single mutant and wild-type plants. the genetic interaction between svr3- <dig> and var2- <dig> resembles those between svr3- <dig> and var2- <dig>  again suggesting that the interaction between these alleles is complex. the acquisition of this second allele of svr <dig> supports our conclusion that at5g <dig> is svr <dig> 

svr <dig> encodes a putative chloroplast typa translation elongation factor
the translation product of svr <dig> is predicted to contain  <dig> amino acids , and it bears high similarity to the e. coli translation factor typa  . typa belongs to the family of translation elongation factor gtpases that include ef-g, ef-tu and lepa  <cit> . a comparison of the domain structures of typa, lepa, ef-g, and ef-tu from e. coli and their putative chloroplast counterparts in arabidopsis is shown in figure 4a. it is notable that, with the exception of a putative chloroplast transit peptide  at the n-terminus of the chloroplast-targeted gene products in arabidopsis , the domains of each factor are highly conserved between the two species. in addition, the four factors have many domains in common. a gtp binding domain  is present in all factors, while typa, lepa and ef-g share an additional three domains   <cit> . ef-g contains a unique domain iv whereas lepa and typa each have a unique c-terminal domain . the overall domain structure of typa is most similar to lepa, which promotes back translocation of peptidyl-trna from p site to a site and deacylated trna from e site to p site, the reverse reaction that is promoted by ef-g  <cit> .

the typa translation factor is widely but not universally found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes  <cit> . a phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the relationship of typa homologs in representative photosynthetic organisms . only one copy of the typa gene is found in e. coli and the photosynthetic cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  however, two typa-like genes are present in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, rice and arabidopsis. the products of these genes fall into two distinct clades. the corresponding arabidopsis and rice genes in each clade having extraordinarily conserved exon structures in terms of exon numbers and sizes, suggesting a common evolutionary ancestor and maybe related functions . interestingly, svr3/at5g <dig> is more closely related to e. coli typa than to the second arabidopsis typa-like protein, at2g <dig> .

plastid localization of svr3
compared to e. coli typa, svr <dig> has a long n-terminal extension  that is predicted to be a chloroplast transit peptide  of  <dig> amino acids  <cit>  and svr <dig> has been identified as a chloroplast protein in several chloroplast proteome studies  <cit> . to confirm the chloroplast location of svr <dig>  a construct was generated that contained the svr <dig> n-terminal region  fused with egfp under the control of the camv  <dig> s promoter , and the construct was transiently expressed in wild-type arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. a control construct contained only egfp . figure  <dig> shows that the green fluorescence signal from the control construct is present in the cytosol , but that the green fluorescence from p35s:svr <dig> ctp:gfp colocalized exclusively with chlorophyll autofluorescence . these results indicate that the transit peptide of svr <dig> is sufficient to direct a protein into the chloroplast, suggesting that svr <dig> is a chloroplast protein.

chloroplast rrna processing defects in tag-11
chloroplast rrna genes  are arranged in single transcription units, rrn operons in the chloroplast genome . after transcription, a series of endonuclease cleavage and exonuclease trimming events are required for the maturation of each rrna species  <cit> . because chloroplast rrna processing defects have been observed in several var <dig> suppressor lines  <cit> , we wanted to address this question in the svr <dig> and tag- <dig> plants. for these analyses, total cellular rnas were extracted from wild-type, var2- <dig>  svr3- <dig>  and tag- <dig>  and northern blot analyses were carried out using rrna gene-specific probes. accumulation patterns of the  <dig> s rrna,  <dig> s rrna and  <dig>  s rrna species reveal that their processing is not drastically altered in either tag- <dig> or svr3- <dig> . however, higher molecular weight precursor forms of all three accumulate to somewhat higher levels in tag- <dig> and svr3- <dig> compared to wild-type or var2- <dig>  considered together, our data suggest that svr <dig> has a small but measurable impact on chloroplast rrna processing.

accumulation of chloroplast proteins in tag-11
though we did not find major defects in chloroplast rrna processing in svr <dig> mutants, we were interested in determining whether the loss of svr <dig> affects the accumulation of chloroplast proteins, given that svr <dig> is a putative chloroplast translation elongation factor. to this end, we carried out immunoblot analysis on total leaf proteins from two-week-old seedlings  using antibodies against representative chloroplast proteins encoded by both the nuclear and plastid genomes . we found that the levels of the var <dig> and atftsh <dig> subunits of thylakoid membrane ftsh complexes are considerably reduced in amount in var2- <dig> and tag- <dig>  this is as anticipated since reductions in the a pair of atftsh subunits are matched by reductions in the b pair, and vice versa, likely via post-translational turnover  <cit> . the coordinate reductions in var <dig>  and atftsh <dig>   <cit>  further suggest that suppression of variegation in tag- <dig> is not due to enhanced expression/stability of ftsh subunit proteins. figure  <dig> shows that the levels of most other proteins we examined do not appear to be significantly perturbed in the various mutant lines, with the exception of the d <dig> protein of psii, which surprisingly was drastically reduced in amount in tag- <dig> and the svr <dig> single mutants. in these plants, d <dig> is present at far less than 25% of the wild-type amount. this suggests that svr <dig> is important for d <dig> accumulation.

svr <dig> is required for normal chloroplast biogenesis under chilling stress
because compromised chloroplast translation often leads to a chilling sensitive phenotype , we were prompted to assess whether chloroplast biogenesis at low temperature is affected in svr3; i.e. whether typa might be involved in the response to chilling stress. figure 8a shows the phenotypes of seven-week-old wild-type, var2- <dig>  tag- <dig> and svr3- <dig> . at 8°c, wild-type plants maintained their ability to produce green leaves. by contrast, the emerging leaves in all mutant lines have a pronounced chlorosis phenotype due to decreased chlorophyll accumulation , suggesting a compromised chloroplast development. the chilling sensitive phenotype of svr3- <dig> was further confirmed in svr3- <dig> and svr3-1/svr3- <dig> plants, indicating that they are allelic .

to investigate whether the chlorosis phenotype of svr <dig> is due to perturbed chloroplast translation under chilling stress, northern blot analysis were used to profile the accumulation of several chloroplast rrna species in samples of total cellular rna from yellow leaf tissues that developed at 8°c . rna samples from emerging wild-type leaves  served as control. inspection of ethidium bromide-stained rna gel shows that chloroplast mature rrna species are greatly reduced in abundance in svr3- <dig> and svr3- <dig> but not in wild-type when grown at 8°c . the accumulation pattern of  <dig> s rrna is shown in figure 8c. in agreement with the stained rna gel, the mature forms of  <dig> s rrnas  are greatly reduced in amount in both svr <dig> alleles while the precursor forms  have an increased abundance. in addition, close examination of the blot revealed that there is a shadowy band  below the  <dig>  kb processing intermediate in svr3- <dig> and svr3- <dig> but not in wild-type, suggesting there might be an additional abnormal processing site of  <dig> s rrna in svr <dig> mutants. this was confirmed by northern blot analyses using  <dig>  s rrna as a probe: in wild-type, only two bands, the  <dig>  kb 23s- <dig>  s dicistronic precursor and the mature form of  <dig>  s rrna, can be detected, whereas an additional band of ~ <dig>  kb is present in svr3- <dig> and svr3- <dig> . this indicates that  <dig> s rrna is abnormally processed closer to its 5'-end in the mutants and this band likely is the shadowy band we observed with  <dig> s rrna probe. figure 8e shows the results of northern blot analysis using the <dig> s rrna probe. as with  <dig> s rrna and  <dig>  s rrna, the precursor form of  <dig> s rrna accumulated to a much higher level in svr <dig> mutants while there was a reduction in the mature form. our results suggest that svr <dig> is required for normal chloroplast rrna processing at 8°c.

we next carried out immunoblot analysis to determine the levels of representative nuclear and plastid encoded proteins in leaf tissues from the mutant and wild-type plants that developed at 8°c . these analyses revealed that the levels of most proteins are not markedly affected by chilling temperatures in the wild-type, the exceptions being d <dig> and atftsh <dig>  which were reduced about 50% at 8°c versus 22°c. figure  <dig> further reveals that there are dramatic reductions in all proteins in the mutant lines  compared to wild-type, but in particular in the amounts of d <dig>  psaf, ls, and the rieske fe-s protein, which are barely detectable at the chilling temperature. this indicates that chloroplast-encoded proteins are not preferentially affected by the 8°c treatment. it is possible that svr <dig> affects the accumulation of chloroplast dna-encoded proteins at 8°c via disrupting chloroplast translation, and that the failure to synthesize chloroplast-encoded subunits of photosynthetic complexes might cause the turnover of unassembled nuclear-encoded subunits of the same complexes.

genetic interaction between svr <dig> and svr7
distinct rrna processing defects have been observed in a number of different svr mutant lines  <cit> , suggesting that this process requires various factors. one of these mutants is svr <dig>  the svr <dig> mutant, identified in our var <dig> suppressor screen, has a pale green phenotype similar to svr <dig>  it is impaired in a chloroplast ppr protein containing a smr domain at its c-terminus  <cit> . ppr proteins are rna-binding proteins that are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of organelle gene expression  <cit> .

as an initial step to investigate the factors that are required in chloroplast rrna processing, we undertook a genetic approach and generated double mutants between svr <dig> and svr <dig>  the genotype of the svr3- <dig> svr7- <dig> double mutant was confirmed by a pcr assay . the svr3- <dig> mutant allele contains a t-dna insertion, so pcr will fail to amplify the fragment bearing the t-dna insert from homozygous svr3- <dig> plant genomic dna . the svr7- <dig> allele contains  <dig> bp deletion in the svr <dig> gene, and the size difference between the wild-type svr <dig> allele and the svr7- <dig> allele can be distinguished by pcr . the phenotype of the svr3- <dig> svr7- <dig> double mutants was examined at 22°c  and 8°c . the double mutant is much smaller and yellower than either of the single mutants at 22°c. at 8°c, even though the svr7- <dig> single mutant is resistant to cold treatment, the svr3- <dig> svr7- <dig> double mutant is susceptible to it inasmuch that the double mutant shows a chlorosis phenotype similar to that of the svr3- <dig> single mutant . double mutant analysis suggests svr <dig> and svr <dig> act in different pathways in promoting chloroplast development.

discussion
possible functions of svr3
in this report, we found that loss of svr <dig>  a putative chloroplast typa translation elongation gtpase, suppresses variegation mediated by var <dig>  and that svr <dig> is essential for plants' ability to develop functional chloroplasts under chilling stress , but not at normal temperature . the typa translation factor is widely conserved but not universally present in all prokaryotes  <cit> , suggesting that it is probably not an essential translation factor. this is consistent with our data that svr <dig> is not essential for plant growth and chloroplast biogenesis at normal growth temperature. the subtle phenotype of svr <dig> at normal temperature and the fact that it is expressed at this temperature suggest that it probably plays a minor role in chloroplast translation at 22°c. at low temperature, however, svr <dig> may become more intimately involved in chloroplast translation and the lack of svr <dig> leads to more pronounced growth defects. nevertheless, an alternative hypothesis is that svr3/typa might be a general stress related protein in plants.

the function of typa has been studied extensively in prokaryotic systems and it is involved in a diverse array of processes including response to bactericidal proteins  <cit> , virulence  <cit> , capsule formation  <cit> , symbiosis  <cit>  and growth under adverse conditions such as low ph, and the presence of sds  <cit> . in salmonella enterica, typa is able to compete with ef-g in ribosome binding, and the gtpase activity of typa is stimulated in the presence of ribosomes  <cit> . it is notable that typa is required for several bacteria species to grown at low temperatures  <cit> , which is consistent with our findings that svr <dig> is required for chloroplast biogenesis at low temperature. however, the exact role of typa or svr <dig> at low temperature is still not clear.

in plants, typa-like proteins have been linked to the development of male reproductive organs  <cit> . the expression of typa in suaeda salsa, a salt resistant plant species, is responsive to oxidative stresses and ectopic overexpression of this gene resulted in increased oxidative tolerance in tobacco plants <cit> . however, it is not clear whether typa directly regulates these cellular processes, or alternatively, whether it primarily regulates ribosome function under various abiotic stresses, and all other processes are affected secondarily.

translation elongation factors ef-tu, ef-g, lepa and typa share a similar arrangement of functional domains, especially the latter three, which share domains i, ii, iii and v and each also contains a unique domain . crystal structures of lepa and ef-g revealed highly similar three-dimensional structures  <cit> . domains i and ii are well conserved and provide sites for interaction with the  <dig> s and  <dig> s subunits of the ribosome, while the remaining three domains mediate interactions between lepa, ef-g with the a site of the ribosome  <cit> . a high resolution typa crystal structure is not yet available but based on the extraordinarily conserved domain arrangement between typa and other two translation elongation factors, we can predict that svr3/atcptypa interacts with chloroplast ribosomes in a manner similar to those of lepa and ef-g with bacterial ribosomes.

despite the above discussed similarities between translation elongation factors, it is likely that each factor also has its own features since each factor contains a unique domain, which might mediate factor specific interactions with the ribosome and facilitate different roles in translation. in the case of svr3/atcptypa, the c-terminal domain may play a crucial role in mediating specific interactions between typa and the ribosome at chilling temperature by mediating specific translation events. for example, we observed a specific reduction of photosystem ii reaction center d <dig> proteins, but not of other plastid genome encoded proteins, in svr <dig> mutants. this certainly raises the possibility that svr <dig> is specifically required for d <dig> translation in the chloroplast.

chlorosis is one common phenotype observed in chilling-injury due to various reasons  <cit> . compromised chloroplast translation is often found in chilling-sensitive mutants. early studies with maize mutants such as m- <dig>  <cit> , v <dig>  <cit>  and hcf <dig>  <cit> , showed that these mutants not only display chlorosis but also have more severe defects in chloroplast ribosome assembly and/or translation while exposed to low temperature. in tobacco, a mutant lacking the non-essential plastid coded ribosomal protein l <dig> has defects recovering from chilling injury  <cit> . chilling stress in tobacco has also been associated with the pausing and delay of chloroplast ribosomes during translation elongation of psba mrna which in turn results in reduced synthesis of d <dig> protein  <cit> . in arabidopsis, a decreased level of plastid protein accumulation has been described in the chilling sensitive <dig>  mutant  <cit> . a second arabidopsis mutant, paleface <dig> , defines a gene encoding a homolog of yeast  <dig> s rrna dimethylase . the phenotype of pfc <dig> is similar to svr <dig> inasmuch as it is indistinguishable from wild-type at normal temperature but displays a chlorosis phenotype at chilling temperature. the source of this chilling sensitivity was traced to an adenosine modification in chloroplast  <dig> s rrna, which was abolished in pfc <dig>  providing direct evidence that chloroplast rrna processing defects can cause plant chilling-sensitivity  <cit> . on the other hand, a perturbed chloroplast rrna processing and/or translation does not necessarily lead to chilling sensitivity  <cit> , suggesting that chilling sensitivity is induced by defect of a specific aspect of chloroplast translation, rather than to a general compromised translation.

it is important to note that svr <dig>  as a translation elongation factor, is not expected to be a basic protein component of the chloroplast ribosome per se. rather we propose that svr <dig> is a regulatory protein that plays a role in translating specific proteins and that is more crucial during stress conditions. it is thus interesting to note that svr <dig> protein levels have been found to be elevated in several chloroplast mutant backgrounds, such as mutants of clpr <dig> and clpr <dig> protease genes, suggesting that svr <dig> may be part of a response pathway that is activated under stress and some other conditions  <cit> . although we do not know how the absence of a regulatory protein such as svr <dig> leads to impaired processing of chloroplast rrna, our data add another factor to the growing list of proteins that have been implicated in the processing of chloroplast rrnas  <cit> . at this stage, we do not yet know why there is reduced chloroplast rrna/ribosome accumulation in svr <dig> at chilling temperatures, nor why there is abnormal rrna processing and whether these two events are linked. there are at least three possible scenarios. one is that svr <dig> might bind to ribosomes directly during ribosome assembly at chilling temperature. this interaction might protect the  <dig> s rrna from being processed by endo- and/or exo-nucleases. the abnormally processed  <dig> s rrna would destabilize ribosomes and eventually prevent them from achieving the maximum translation efficiency, which could be critical during the early stages of chloroplast biogenesis under chilling stress. a second possibility is that, instead of affecting chloroplast ribosome biogenesis directly, svr <dig> might be important for the robust translation of a factor that is required for chilling tolerance during the transition from proplastids to chloroplasts, and that lack of this factor could lead to the abnormal processing event. another possible explanation is that the svr <dig> mutation slows down chloroplast translation at low temperature, which reduces the rate of ribosomal protein synthesis, and in turn slows down ribosome assembly and rrna processing.

the dramatic rrna processing defects and loss of chloroplast proteins at low growth temperatures in svr <dig> are not common phenomena observed in other svr mutants. for example, svr <dig>  in which a chloroplast ppr protein is disrupted, is quite resistant to cold stress and shows similar chloroplast rrna and proteins accumulation patterns under normal and cold growth conditions  <cit> .

mechanism of var <dig> suppression in tag-11
previously, a number of studies have established a link between compromised chloroplast translation and suppression of var <dig>  <cit> . the identification of svr <dig>  which encodes a putative chloroplast typa translation elongation factor, reinforces this notion. however, one distinctive phenotype of tag- <dig> is that the genetic interaction between var2- <dig> and svr <dig> is not epistatic as seen in other suppressor lines  <cit>  in that the single svr <dig> mutant resembles many other suppressor single mutants and has a slightly pale green leaf color, but the double mutant suppressor line tag- <dig> is smaller than svr <dig> single mutants and displays some variegation at later development stages. this is true for both alleles of svr <dig>  indicating that it is specific for the svr <dig> locus, rather than due to independent mutations in the svr3- <dig> and svr3- <dig> backgrounds. the incomplete suppression of variegation in tag- <dig> raises the question about the complexity of the interaction between chloroplast translation and var <dig> function.

though the exact role of var <dig> in chloroplast translation is unclear, both ours and other's genetic data have clearly established a link between var <dig> and chloroplast translation. the notion that var <dig> may be directly involved in chloroplast translation is not far-fetched and in fact is in agreement with findings in mitochondria, where an ftsh-like protease m-aaa, consisting of two homologous subunits yta <dig> and yta <dig>  has been shown to be involved in the degradation of a number of mitochondrial inner membrane proteins  <cit> . in a landmark finding by thomas langer's group, the authors identified proteins that interact with the m-aaa complex  <cit> . surprisingly, these include mrpl <dig>  a ribosomal protein of the  <dig> s subunit of the mitochondrial  <dig> s ribosome encoded by the nuclear genome. the authors were able to demonstrate that m-aaa is responsible for processing of the mrpl <dig> precursor after it is translocated into the mitochondria but prior to its integration into the  <dig> s ribosome. furthermore, many defects of yta <dig> and yta <dig> mutants can be rescued by simply providing the mature form of mrpl <dig> in the mitochondria, indicating that the failure to properly process mrpl <dig> is the underlying cause of yta <dig> and yta <dig> mutant phenotypes  <cit> .

currently there are no data suggesting similar direct interaction between var <dig> and its homologues with chloroplast ribosome. early findings with chloroplast ribosomes have established that there are at least two sub-groups of chloroplast ribosomes: the stromal "free" ribosomes and the thylakoid-bound ribosomes  <cit> . on the other hand, ftsh complex containing var <dig> is situated in the thylakoid membrane. thus it is conceivable that there might be functional relationships between these two complexes, particularly so considering the strong genetic link that has been established.

CONCLUSIONS
in this report, we demonstrated that the disruption of svr <dig>  encoding a putative chloroplast typa-type translation elongation factor, is the cause for the suppression of var2-mediated leaf variegation in tag- <dig> suppressor line. svr <dig> mutations do not lead to major defects under normal growth temperature . however, at low temperature , the loss of svr <dig> leads to major chloroplast rrna processing defects and reduced chloroplast protein accumulations. this work identified a new var <dig> suppressor locus, reinforced the genetic link between var <dig> and chloroplast translation and also revealed a novel role for svr <dig> in plant's responses to chilling stress.
