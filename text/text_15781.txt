BACKGROUND
red blood cells  have been utilized as the treatment for severe blood loss and hematopoiesis study; but their clinic application has been constrained by limited quantities and compatibility issues. the availability of hescs offers a great opportunity to produce large quantities of erythroid cells in vitro for transfusion, and to provide additional knowledge to the field of erythropoiesis. previous studies have generated primitive erythroid cells from hescs by embryoid body formation and stromal cell co-culturing  <cit> . however, the risk of mouse-related diseases and the low differentiation efficiency of hescs are major limitations of the clinical application of this study.

recently, we have established a method to produce relatively large number of human hematopoietic cells from hescs, via a human-derived induction system, by using hflscs feeder cells and cell extract of hflt. use of this culture method enabled the production of  <dig> % cd34+ from treated hebs after  <dig> days of culture. more importantly, hebs-induced hematopoietic cells predominantly yielded erythroid precursors when seeded on methylcellulose  <cit> . based on the above results, we isolated the 11- day hebs from the co-culture system and transplanted them into liquid medium for a 16-day extending culture. during the 16-day culture, cytokines are used to first promote the proliferation and subsequently used for the maturation of erythroid precursors. this culture method enabled the production of about  <dig> ×  <dig> fully differentiated erythroid cells from about  <dig> ×  <dig> hebs. the erythroid cells morphologically resembled fetal liver-derived erythroblasts, they mainly expressed embryonic hemoglobin and could be enucleated. our results show that induction of hescs into mature erythroid cells in vitro is possible by treatment with cytokine-supplemented cell extract.

RESULTS
the effects of hflt cell extract treatment on hebs
after culture on low-attachment plates for about  <dig> hours, flat hescs differentiated into typically round hebs. the permeabilization of hebs was analyzed with the streptolysin-o  assay. in a previous study, we found that most hebs could be labeled with texas red containing  <dig> ng/ml slo  <cit> , therefore we chose to incubate hebs with  <dig> ng/ml slo for  <dig> min in this experiment. after incubation, the permeabilized hebs were exposed to hflt cell extract. to reseal cellular plasma membranes, cells were then cultured in imdm containing 10% fetal calf serum  and  <dig> mm cacl <dig>  

the capacity of erythroid-like development of hebs
in a previous study, we found that cell extract treatment could influence differentiation of hebs but only hflt cell extract treatment could improve hematopoietic differentiation of hebs  <cit> . this experiment provided an opportunity to conduct a large-scale investigation of hescs-derived erythropoiesis after hflt cell extract treatment. firstly, we treated hebs with hflt cell extract as described previously  <cit> . then the treated hebs were co-cultured on the hflscs feeder in hebs differentiation medium for the hematopoietic differentiation, and the untreated hebs were culture in the same condition as a control.

to examine the capacity for erythroid development of hebs, the cells were analyzed by hematopoietic colony assays, and colonies were scored according to their cellular morphology. our results showed that, for untreated hebs, the colony-forming cells  were first found in the day- <dig> hebs and various types of hematopoietic cfcs increased rapidly afterwards, including colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage , colony-forming units- macrophage , colony-forming units-erythroid  colonies, and they reached a peak in day- <dig> hebs. as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the hematopoietic colonies were cfu-gm. at the peak , about  <dig> ×  <dig> untreated hebs-derived cells generated  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hematopoietic colonies, of which about 55% were cfu-gm and about 22% were erythroid bursts. for hflt cell extract treated hebs, hematopoietic colonies were first detected in day- <dig> hebs and they reached a peaked on day  <dig>  the number of colony-forming cells produced from the treated hebs was much greater than that from untreated. at the peak, about  <dig> ×  <dig> untreated hebs-derived cells could generate  <dig>  ±  <dig>  hematopoietic colonies. interestingly, hflt cell extract exposure had a greater effect, both number and frequency, on erythroid colony formation of hebs. the frequency of cfu-e colonies reached 62% on day  <dig> of hebs . altogether, these data suggested a supportive role of hflt cell extract on the erythroid lineage development at the clonal level.

the effects of hflt cell extract treatment on gene expression
to understand the effects of hflt cell extract treatment on gene expression, we investigated the erythroid associated genes of hebs at different days of co-cultures including scl, gata- <dig>  gata- <dig>  eklf by rt-pcr. we found that the exposure to hflt cell extract could promote the erythroid associated gene expression . after incubation with hflt cell extract, scl was first detected as early as day  <dig> and gata- <dig> was expressed by day  <dig>  this data confirmed our previous report  <cit> . the eklf mrna was detectable by day  <dig> of differentiation, and its expression was persistently high throughout the remaining of time course. gata- <dig> was obviously expressed by day  <dig> and up-regulated from day  <dig>  however, for untreated hebs, scl could be first detected by day  <dig> and gata- <dig> could be found by day  <dig> at a low level. the other erythroid-associated genes that were tested were difficult to detect before day  <dig> in the untreated group.

production of red blood cells from hebs
our data confirmed that hebs treated with hflt cell extract possessed a good capacity for erythroid lineage development, and the 11-day hebs could yield the greatest number of erythroid colonies. to generate a large-scale of erythroid cells from hescs, we isolated the 11-day treated hebs and plated cells in liquid medium. since bone morphogenetic protein- <dig>  and flt- <dig> ligand  could promote expanding capacity of hematopoietic cells, so cells were incubated with bmp <dig> , stem cell factor , erythropoietin  and flt-3l from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  insulin like growth factor- <dig>  was necessary for normal erythroid differentiation <cit> , so erythroid progenitors cells were stimulated by incubation with igf- <dig> , scf , epo from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  the number of cells was counted during the 16-day liquid culture period. the results showed that the cells expanded rapidly from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and the number of cells increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  per well of 24-well plate. however, the cell numbers did not increase from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  so about  <dig>  heb cells could yield about  <dig>  erythroid cells during a 16-day incubation, which implied a 100-fold amplification of the erythroid cells produced from the eb cells. .

to monitor the differentiation of heb cells into erythroid cells, cd <dig>  and glycophorin a  antigens were examined by flow cytometry assay throughout the culture. at the beginning of the liquid culture, cd71+ cells were detected at a low lever and gla+ cells could not be detected at all . cd71+ cells increased rapidly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  and reached  <dig> % of their peak level at day  <dig> and subsequently decreased. about 34% of the cells were cd71+cells at the day  <dig>  in contrast, however, gla+ cells expanded significantly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  gla+ cells could not reach 30% at the day  <dig>  but peaked  <dig> % at the end of culture 

analysis of hebs-derived erythroid cells
to further characterize the erythroid cells derived from hebs, we stained cells with wright-giemsa reagents and compared them with rbcs derived from human fetal liver. we found that hflt cell extract treatment plus cytokines promoted enucleation of hebs-derived erythroid cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  the enucleated hebs-derived rbcs were first detected at day  <dig> in liquid medium and approximately 20% to 35% of erythroid cells were enucleated at day  <dig> 

we next examined globin expression patterns of these erythroid cells generated from hebs after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days of culture by real-time pcr. then we found that the cells derived from treated hebs expressed embryonic globins  but not adult globins  at the beginning of culture. the expression of ζ and ε-globins mrna increased rapidly from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  subsequently peaked at day  <dig> and then decreased. the expression of α and γ-globins mrna peaked at day  <dig>  in contrast, the expression of β-globin was first detected at day  <dig> at a low level.

to further observe the expression pattern of globins, we analyzed hebs-derived erythroid cells at different days by western blotting. we found ζ, ε, α and γ globins proteins were detected by day  <dig> and β-globin protein could be found at day  <dig> , which confirmed that erythroid cells generated from hebs possessed the capacity to express the adult globin at the end of culture. these data indicated that globins expression of erythroid cells generated from hebs might begin to switch from the embryonic to the adult type at day  <dig> 

functional analysis of hebs-derived erythroid cells
to assess the function of the hebs-derived erythroid cells, we measured oxygen dissociation of hebs-derived erythroid cells and compared them with human cord blood  and human adult peripheral blood. as shown in figure 6c, hebs -derived erythroid cells displayed an oxygen dissociation curve similar to that of hcb, but shifted to the left as compared to the curve of human adult peripheral blood.

discussion
in this study, we first established a system to induce the production of a large number of erythroid cells from hescs utilizing four standard procedures. in the first and second steps, the hebs were treated with the cell extract from 14-weeks fetal liver and co-cultured with hflscs feeders. cell extract treatment is a novel trans-differentiation strategy that can convert a somatic cell type into another type  <cit> . we recently reported a new method to promote the differentiation of human stem cells toward hematopoietic lineages by the treatment with cell extract of hflt  <cit> . the fetal liver is a very important organ of human hematopoiesis, and can generate not only transplantable hematopoietic stem cells, but also enucleated rbcs. we therefore speculated that hflt cell extract treatment may be advantageous for erythroid line development as well. in the current study, we isolated hebs from co-cultures after treatment with hflt cell extract and examined their capacity for the erythroid development at different period of time. at same time the untreated hebs were isolated from co-cultures as a control. we found that the treated hebs in the co-culture system could express the erythroid associated genes and give rise to erythroid lineage colonies in semisolid medium, whereas the untreated hebs did not express erythroid associated genes and mainly yielded cfu-gm with the same experimental conditions. thus, our data provided strong evidence which shows that treated hebs-derived hematopoiesis mainly generated erythroid cells.

furthermore, we isolated the treated hebs from co-cultures and induced them into erythroid cells in two -phases. at the beginning of the culture, addition of bmp <dig>  flt-3l, scf, and epo resulted in a rapid increase in cell numbers and an accumulation of differentiated cells. cd <dig> was used as a marker for early erythroid cells and gla used as a marker for mature erythroid cells. during the first stage of liquid culture, we observed an obvious increase of cd71+ cells and a slight increase of gla+ cells, which implied the generation and expansion of early erythroid cells from hebs. from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  stimulated by igf- <dig>  scf and a high dose of epo, most of the cells had characteristics of mature erythroid cells. during this stage we observed a peak in the percentage of gla+ cells, but the percentage of cd71+ cells decreased at the end of culture.

to further understand the erythropoiesis of hescs, we examined globins expression of erythroid cells from hebs. according to our previous study, erythroid cells derived from hebs only expressed embryonic globins but not adult globin  <cit> . however, in this study we found that hebs-derived erythroid cells expressed both the embryonic and adult globins at the end of culture. one possible explanation for this result relates to the complex process of mammalian erythropoiesis. in the primitive hematopoiesis wave, blood islands in the yolk sac transiently generate nucleated rbcs. in the later stage of development, the fetal liver is the primary site for production of transplantable hematopoietic stem cells and enucleated rbcs. definitive hematopoiesis ultimately shifts to the bone marrow, the site for production of life-long adult-type hematopoiesis <cit> . erythrocytes from different hematopoietic sites expressed different types of globins. yolk sac-derived erythrocytes express only embryonic globins, and erythroblasts produced in fetal liver express embryonic globins and a small amount of adult globin. erythroblasts from bone marrow primarily expressed adult globin. in our inducing system, hebs were treated with hflt cell extract and co-cultured with hflscs. it is possible that this condition mimics the environment of the fetal liver and results in similar globin expression of the hebs-derived erythroid cells as with fetal liver-derived erythroid cells.

a critical issue for clinical application of hescs is whether they can generate functionally mature progenies. in our system, enucleated rbcs could first be observed at day  <dig> of liquid culture. the number of enucleated rbcs increased rapidly from day  <dig> to  <dig>  the erythroid cells produced from treated hebs morphologically resembled rbcs from human fetal liver. capability of carrying oxygen is an important function of rbcs. to determine if hebs-derived erythroid cells possessed the same function as normal rbcs, we analyzed the function of hebs-derived erythroid cells and found that the oxygen dissociation curve of hebs-derived erythroid cells shifted to left compared to the curve of human adult blood. to our knowledge, the oxygen dissociation curve of hcb was shifted left when compared to that of human adult peripheral blood  <cit> . our results implied that hebs-derived erythoid cells were also able to function as oxygen carriers and the oxygen dissociation pattern of these cells was more similar to fetal blood cells than adult blood cells. thus rbcs derived from hebs in our system may act as an alternative resource of rbcs from blood.

CONCLUSIONS
hematopoietic differentiation of hescs has been achieved by using a variety of experimental approaches <cit> . in addition, the successful derivation of rbcs from hcb has been achieved by many published assays <cit> . however, there are only a few published reports on erythroid differentiation from hescs. trans-differentiation of a somatic cell type into another cell type would be beneficial for producing replacement cells for potential therapeutic applications. in this study, we first reported that fetal liver cell extract-based treatment induced the differentiation of hescs into rbcs safely and efficiently. our method provides a useful tool for studying the molecular mechanisms of hematopoietic development, and will be valuable in the production of rbcs for transfusion.
