BACKGROUND
vibrio vulnificus is an opportunistic pathogen that causes sepsis in humans after ingestion of contaminated raw oysters or wound infection and necrotizing fasciitis from contamination of wounds . the mortality rates for sepsis and wound infection are ~50% and ~15%, respectively. during infection of humans the bacteria replicate rapidly, extensively invade tissues, and cause severe tissue destruction. mouse models of infection coupled with molecular genetic analysis have identified several virulence factors partially explaining the high mortality and extreme tissue destruction, most importantly, polysaccharide capsule  <cit> , rtxa <dig> toxin  <cit> , acquisition of iron  <cit> , pili  <cit> , and flagella  <cit> . however, these factors do not completely explain the remarkable virulence of v. vulnificus.

v. vulnificus can be classified in several different manners. one of the first classification schemes was based on biochemical reactions of strains initially yielding two biotypes: biotype  <dig> most often associated with contamination of oysters and causing human disease and biotype  <dig> associated with infection of eels  <cit> . recently, a third biotype that caused wound infection from handling fish in israel was identified  <cit> . genetic analysis using analysis of ribosomal rna loci  <cit> , multilocus sequence typing   <cit> , and virulence-correlated gene  pcr  <cit>  revealed that v. vulnificus strains could be divided into two groups. while the descriptors for these two groups vary , the terms clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> are used here to follow the mlst clusters of bisharat et al.  <cit> . biotype  <dig> strains are present in both clades, whereas biotype  <dig> strains are present only in clade  <dig>  based on mlst analysis, biotype  <dig> strains appear to be a hybrid between clades  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . clade  <dig> strains are most often isolated from environmental samples, while clade  <dig> strains are most often associated with human disease. because of these epidemiological patterns, many investigators hypothesized that clade  <dig> strains possess inherently greater virulence. in an analysis of  <dig> biotype  <dig> v. vulnificus strains, we recently determined that both clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> strains have the ability to cause severe skin infection in subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mice . the major distinction between the clades was that clade  <dig> strains had a greater propensity to cause systemic infection and death in the mouse model, although there were some attenuated clade  <dig> strains and highly virulent clade  <dig> strains.

analysis of the genomic dna sequences of clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> strains would contribute to the identification of genetic differences among strains. as microbes engage in lateral gene transfer and are often highly divergent in genomic content, this study could help identify genes responsible for the differences in virulence between these clades. both of the complete and annotated v. vulnificus genomes are of clade  <dig> strains, cmcp <dig>  and yj <dig> . the lack of genomic sequence data from clade  <dig> strains is a serious impediment to understanding the differences in virulence between the two clades and in dissecting the virulence of v. vulnificus in general. we therefore undertook the present study to rapidly and economically obtain genomic sequence of numerous v. vulnificus strains representing both clades and the two major biotypes.

we hypothesized that clade  <dig> strains are more virulent, at least in part, because they contain unique virulence genes that are missing in most clade  <dig> strains. therefore, identifying dna sequences common to clade  <dig> strains and missing from clade  <dig> strains would create a set of putative virulence genes that could be subsequently experimentally examined. because of the propensity of clade  <dig> strains to be associated with oysters, these strains may possess unique genes enabling colonization of shellfish. therefore, unique clade  <dig> genes offer insight into the vibrio-oyster relationship. however, not all genes uniquely associated with one clade will be involved with interactions with animal hosts, and virulence genes will not necessarily be present only in virulent genotypes. an example of the former is that the ability of v. vulnificus to ferment mannitol is associated with the cluster of strains that we are calling clade  <dig> most often derived from clinical cases  <cit> , and an example of the latter is the nearly universal presence of the rtxa <dig> toxin in both virulent and attenuated v. vulnificus strains . finally, by comparing the genomes of a variety of strains representing the different clades and biotypes, the set of genes in the v. vulnificus genome shared by all v. vulnificus strains can be identified. over and above identifying relationships between the presence and/or absence of genes among strains, identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  could also reveal the genetic basis for differential virulence and shellfish-colonizing phenotypes, as well as other phenotypes.

given these goals, we used the solid sequencing system on four v. vulnificus strains, each of which represented a unique genotype/virulence phenotype combination . v. vulnificus m06-24/o  <cit>  is a typical clade  <dig> strain exhibiting a high level of virulence in the subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mouse model  <cit> . strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig>  <cit>  is a typical clade  <dig> strain that can infect skin tissues but is defective at causing systemic infection and death in the mouse model. strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig>  <cit>  is an unusual clade  <dig> strain that is highly virulent in the mouse model, causing systemic infection and death. atcc  <dig>  <cit>  is typical biotype  <dig> strain isolated from an eel. using solid sequencing enabled us to obtain approximately 100x coverage with 35-nt reads among four genomes. this selection of strains analyzed with solid sequencing enabled comparative genomics to be performed and identified clade 2-specific genomic sequences and the genes of v. vulnificus shared among all of the strains sequenced to date.

*virulence data for biotype  <dig> strains are from thiaville, p.c., et al.  and for atcc  <dig> are from this study. mlst, vcg, and rep-pcr data are from mahmud, et al.  <cit> . rrn data for biotype  <dig> strains are from thiaville, p.c., et al.  and for atcc  <dig> are from vickery et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
numbers of solid sequencing reads
we performed solid sequencing on the genomes of four v. vulnificus strains to increase the understanding of the genetic differences between the two major clades and the biotypes of this organism and to possibly identify sequences associated with differences in virulence potential in our subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mouse model  <cit> . v. vulnificus 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> are clade  <dig> strains, typically isolated from environmental sources. strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> exhibits the typical attenuated virulence of clade  <dig> strains, i.e., it can cause skin infection but is defective at causing systemic infection and death. in contrast, strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> exhibits a high level virulence more characteristic of clade  <dig> strains, i.e., it causes skin infection, systemic infection, and death . v. vulnificus m06-24/o is a typical clade  <dig> strain with full virulence that has been widely used in examining molecular pathogenesis by many laboratories  <cit> . v. vulnificus atcc  <dig> is a biotype  <dig> strain isolated from an eel  <cit> . genomic dna from each of these strains was loaded onto one-fourth of a  <dig> mm ×  <dig> mm solid™ slide for sequencing on an applied biosystems solid™ apparatus at the university of florida interdisciplinary center for biotechnology research, as described in the methods. the total numbers of 35-bp reads for each strain were as follows: 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  99- <dig> dp-b <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig> , m06-24/o -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  and atcc  <dig> -  <dig>  ×  <dig>  these totals represented putative 210- to 239-fold coverage of each of the genomes, on the assumption that all of the data were usable. the reads from each of the four newly sequenced genomes have been deposited into the ncbi short read archive .

comparison of solid sequencing reads to reference v. vulnificus genomes
reads were mapped onto the two reference v. vulnificus genomes, cmcp <dig> and yj <dig> using maq  <cit> . this analysis enabled the identification of dna sequences and orfs that were present in the newly sequenced strains that have already been described in the reference strains. graphical representation of the coverage of the cmcp <dig> and yj <dig> genomes by the reads from each of the four newly sequenced v. vulnificus strains is shown in figure  <dig> 

we then mapped reads to plasmids described for biotype  <dig> v. vulnificus and whose dna sequences are known   <cit> . as expected, greater than 90% of all three of these reference sequences were matched to reads from biotype  <dig> atcc  <dig>  and lesser homologies were observed for the biotype  <dig> strains . for clade  <dig> strains, between  <dig> and 56% of these plasmid sequences matched with 99- <dig> dp-b <dig>  and only  <dig> to 20% of plasmid sequenced matched the solid reads from strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig>  these results suggested that 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> would have a plasmid, whereas 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> would not, and we confirmed this by gel electrophoresis of extracted plasmid dna . the reads from strain m06-24/o, which is a clade  <dig> strain and least related to the other strains, only matched to 1% of plasmid pc4602- <dig> and failed to match to any sequences of plasmids pc4602- <dig> and pr <dig>  this is in agreement with m06-24/o not having a plasmid  <cit> .

despite the prediction of approximately 210-fold coverage based on the raw number of reads obtained for each genome, coverage was actually on the order of 100-fold. in total, 45% to 64% of the raw sequencing reads mapped to one of the two reference genomes, leaving a considerable number of unmapped reads. some of these reads were of low complexity and may represent sequencing error. because approximately 14% of both cmcp <dig> and yj <dig> are low complexity, these unmapped reads also may be derived from regions of low complexity in the sequenced genomes. it is a limitation of the short read technology that we cannot distinguish among these scenarios. for the remaining unmapped reads that were not of low complexity, there are two possibilities: these reads represented truly unique sequences for the newly sequenced genomes or these reads were errors in the sequencing system. in an attempt to separate these two possibilities, these unmapped reads were compared to several bacterial genomes by mapping the reads in solid colorspace using maq  <cit> . this would identify orthologs of v. vulnificus strains in other species. the largest number of matches  was found with the genomic sequence of v. cholerae nc <dig> . . these v. cholerae matches yielded  <dig> genes in total from the four sequenced genomes. of these v. cholerae genes, sixteen were identified from only a single v. vulnificus strain. other novel genes may still be found, but they would be genes not previously identified in any other bacterial genomes.

there were between  <dig> and  <dig> million unmatched reads for each of the newly sequenced genomes. the cause of such a large amount of data with no similarity to known genes cannot be explained by low complexity alone, as many of these reads are not of low complexity. while it remains possible that novel genes are included in these data, it is also possible that these reads are just noise from the technology.

another cmcp6-specific region spanned the beginning and ends of chromosome  <dig> . this region also appeared to encode a phage or other mobile genetic element. a smaller cmcp6-specific region located at genes vv1_ <dig> to vv1_ <dig> appeared to encode sugar metabolism genes possibly involved in lipopolysaccharide  or capsular biosynthesis. cmcp <dig> chromosome  <dig> contained a very large region at genes vv2_ <dig> to vv2_ <dig> not present in any other strains. this region appeared to have been derived from a mobile genetic element, either a phage or transposon. there were also smaller regions unique to cmcp <dig> on chromosome  <dig> 

the yj <dig> genome similarly contained numerous regions that were not present in any of the other newly sequenced genomes. on chromosome  <dig>  yj016-specific genes were located at vv <dig> to vv <dig>  vv <dig> to vv <dig>  vv <dig> to vv <dig>  vv <dig> to vv <dig>  and vv <dig> to vv <dig>  the largest of these yj <dig> regions at vv <dig> to vv <dig> appeared to be phage-related. a similar pattern was evident for yj <dig> chromosome  <dig>  a very large yj106-specific region spanning vva <dig> to vva <dig> was notable. this region consisted mainly of hypothetical proteins, but there is a possibility that this region is phage-related, as vva <dig> is annotated as a phage integrase.

the coverage of the yj <dig> plasmid, which encodes  <dig> genes, was very different among the four newly sequenced genomes. the genomes containing the most matches were 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and atcc  <dig>  with  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, matched to the yj <dig> plasmid. as expected, both 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and atcc  <dig> contain plasmids. none of the yj <dig> plasmid genes matched to the reads of 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> or m06-24/o, neither of which contains plasmids.

v. vulnificus, like other vibrio species, encodes a super-integron on its large chromosome  <cit> . integrons are specific regions of genomic sequence that have the ability to accumulate gene cassettes via site-specific recombination  <cit> . they are located in genomes at atti sites and contain a site-specific integrase, inti, that mediates acquisition of gene cassettes at repetitive attc sites, which are generally conserved among closely related bacteria. the vibrio integrons are called super-integrons because of their unusually large sizes  <cit> . in cmcp <dig> the super-integron spans genes vv1_ <dig> to vv1_ <dig>  and in yj <dig> the super-integron spans genes vv <dig> to vv <dig>  as shown in additional file  <dig>  table s3a and additional file  <dig>  table s3b, the genes encoded within these super-integrons are mostly strain-specific, not having significant homology with the four newly sequenced genomes or each other. it is interesting that the super-integrons did not appear in figure  <dig> as missing from the newly sequenced genomes, most likely because of the attc sites and presence of infrequent homologous genes between the genomes.

in contrast to identifying sequences missing from the newly sequenced genomes, we also identified the genes shared among all of the six genomes, thereby identifying the core v. vulnificus genome. up to this point, shared genes based on the two reference genomes numbered  <dig>  genes. adding our four newly sequenced genomes, there are  <dig>  genes common to all sequenced v. vulnificus strains, listed in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  the number of shared genes can only get smaller as more genomes are sequenced. since there are  <dig>  protein-coding genes in the cmcp <dig> genome and  <dig>  protein-coding genes in the yj <dig> genome, but only  <dig>  genes shared between them, there is clearly an enormous amount of strain-specific sequence among these clade  <dig> strains. the frequency of hypothetical proteins in the core genome was  <dig> % compared with the overall frequency of  <dig> % in the cmcp <dig> genome.

the total number of genes obtained by combining the cmcp <dig> and yj <dig> reference genomes and excluding redundancy is  <dig> . among the  <dig>  genes in the cmcp <dig> genome,  <dig>  were unique to this strain, and among the  <dig>  genes in the yj <dig> genome,  <dig>  were unique to this strain relative to all of the other genomes. by combining the matches for each strain with the reference genomes we identified the following numbers of genes for each strain: atcc  <dig> -  <dig> ; 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> -  <dig> ; 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> -  <dig> ; and m06-24/o -  <dig> .

genomic inference of different v. vulnificus genotypes
we asked which genes were common only to the three biotype 1/clade  <dig> strains, but not present in the two biotype 1/clade  <dig> strains or the biotype  <dig> strain, because this could help identify the genes that are responsible for the increased virulence of clade  <dig> strains . the  <dig> clade 2-specific genes are listed in table  <dig>  among the notable clade 2-specific genes and regions are several ggdef proteins  and a flp pilus-coding region . ggdef proteins are involved with signal transduction in many bacteria by regulating intracellular levels of the signaling molecule cyclic-di-gmp  <cit> , and flp pili could be involved with adherence or genetic exchange  <cit> . hypothetical proteins comprised  <dig> % of the clade 2-specific genes, compared with the overall frequency of  <dig> % of hypothetical proteins in the cmcp <dig> genome. because the reference strains are both clade  <dig>  any clade 1-specific genes will be missed in this initial mapping.

strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> is a typical clade  <dig> strain with attenuated virulence, while strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> is a clade  <dig> strain with high virulence typical of clade  <dig> strains. there were  <dig> genes in 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> that were common to the three clade  <dig> strains but missing from attenuated clade  <dig> strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and biotype  <dig> strain atcc  <dig>  . this set of genes could contain virulence genes acquired by 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> that endow it with clade 2-like virulence. hypothetical proteins comprised  <dig> % of this set of genes, compared with the overall frequency of  <dig> % hypothetical proteins in the cmcp <dig> genome. it is noteworthy that the clade  <dig> + 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> specific set of genes includes genomic island xii identified by cohen et al.  <cit>  as being present in most clade  <dig> strains and missing from most clade  <dig> strains . they hypothesized that genomic island xii could be responsible for the putative differential virulence of clade  <dig> strains, evidenced by their association with clinical cases.

within genomic island xii are paralogs of galactose utilization genes  that are in an operon with a predicted sulfate transporter . the canonical gale  and galt  are located elsewhere in the galetkm operon . the presence of additional galet genes in a subset of v. vulnificus strains with high virulence suggests a role for these genes in another metabolic pathway possibly benefitting the bacteria during infection.

the link with sulfate metabolism was intriguing because five other genomic island xii genes are annotated as arylsulfatase a  or alkyl sulfatase . these enzymes hydrolyze the sulfate from sulfated gangliosides . vv2_ <dig> and vv2_ <dig> in the genomic island encode chondroitinases . sulfatides are important components of connective tissue involved with cell adhesion  <cit>  and serve as the receptors for various microbial pathogens ranging from hiv  <cit> , bordetella pertussis  <cit> , and helicobacter pylori  <cit> . an arylsulfatase of e. coli k <dig> is necessary for invasion of the blood-brain barrier  <cit> ; hence, such activity in virulent v. vulnificus strains could enable invasion through tissues, which is characteristic of v. vulnificus infection. in clinical v. vulnificus isolates, the presence of region xii, encoding arylsulfatases, chondroitinases, sulfate transport, and sulfate metabolism functions, suggests that this region may have an important scavenging function removing sulfate groups from host components, thereby providing sulfur and/or carbon sources, which could facilitate survival in the human host where free sulfur is limited. however, as noted above, some of the degradative enzymes in genomic island xii could also be involved in invasion of tissues. cohen et al.  <cit>  had noted the presence of such genes in genomic island xii predominant in the clade of v. vulnificus strains most associated with clinical strains. the exclusive presence of all of these genes in clade  <dig> plus the highly virulent clade  <dig> strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> suggests a role in virulence. the dissection of the roles in virulence, if any, played by these genomic island xii genes identified through our comparative genomic analysis will await construction and analysis of specific mutants. however, bryant et al.  <cit>  described the use of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polymyxin b-sucrose plates for the identification of v. vulnificus from shellfish samples. the ability of bacteria to form halos around colonies on this medium is indicative of alkyl sulfatase activity. in contrast to our determination that vv2_ <dig> is absent in the biotype  <dig> strain atcc  <dig> and clade  <dig> strain 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and the results of cohen et al.  <cit>  similarly describing the limited presence of genomic island  <dig> among v. vulnificus strains, bryant et al. observed that all  <dig> v. vulnificus strains examined possessed alkyl sulfatase activity. however, vv2_ <dig> and vv2_ <dig> are also annotated as alkyl sulfatase. our results show that vv2_ <dig> is present in all six strains except 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> and vv2_ <dig> is present in all six strains. hence, it would be expected that all v. vulnificus strains would exhibit alkyl sulfatase activity, in agreement with bryant et al.  <cit> .

also of note in the clade  <dig> plus 99- <dig> dp-b5-specific genes not present in genomic island xii were linked genes possibly involved with sialic acid catabolism: n-acetylneuraminate lyase , a trap transport system possibly involved with sialic acid transport , n-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase , n-acetylmannosamine kinase , and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase . because the nagb gene  is in the v. vulnificus core genome, the clade  <dig> strains and 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> uniquely have the ability to assimilate exogenous sialic acid into central metabolism as fructose-6-phosphate, relative to the other clade  <dig> strains and biotype  <dig> strains. however, v. vulnificus does not encode a neuraminidase  which would liberate sialic acid from host components. almagro-moreno and boyd  <cit>  had noted that sialic acid metabolism was unique to bacteria that interacted with mammalian hosts, either as pathogens or as commensals. jeong et al.  <cit>  recently constructed a nana deletion in v. vulnificus and confirmed that the ability to utilize exogenous sialic acid was essential for virulence in intraperitoneally inoculated iron dextran-treated mice, as well as cytotoxicity in cell culture assays. they focused analysis of nana on a single v. vulnificus strain and did not perform comparative genetics among strains of different genotypes or virulence phenotypes. the summation of these data regarding nana is that our comparative genomic sequencing correctly identified unique virulence genes among different sets of v. vulnificus.

another carbon source utilization pathway specific to the clade  <dig> plus 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> strains but not in genomic island xii is a complete mannitol catabolic pathway encoding the mannitol/fructose-specific phosphotransferase system iia protein , mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase , and a specific mannitol repressor . the significance of these genes to virulence is unknown. interestingly, by examining  <dig> v. vulnificus strains, drake et al.  <cit>  previously determined that the ability to ferment mannitol by v. vulnificus was highly correlated with a strain being in, what we are calling, clade  <dig>  tison et al.  <cit>  reported that biotype  <dig> strains were mannitol-negative. our sequencing data, albeit on a considerably smaller sample size of strains, therefore corroborate the phenotypic analyses of these two previous studies.

snp analysis
in addition to the presence or absence of whole genes or blocks of genes, detailed above, genetic variation among the sequenced strains also consisted of nucleotide polymorphisms. we used maq to identify snps present in the newly sequenced genomes relative to the reference genomes. the snps from each of the pairwise analyses versus the reference genomes are listed in additional files  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and the summary of the numbers of snps from each sequenced strain relative to the reference genomes is shown in table  <dig>  in examining snps, we did not exclude any sets of genes, such as putative mobile genetic elements, e.g., phages. it is interesting that m06-24/o, which had the highest amount of coverage relative to the reference genomes, had the lowest number of snps  compared with the other three strains . this likely reflects the fact that m06-24/o is in the same clade as the reference genomes.

the accuracy of the solid-based snps in identifying polymorphisms was verified by examining sanger sequencing of specific genomic regions of each of these strains. having examined  <dig>  kb of sanger-derived sequence that contained snps identified from our solid sequencing, we determined that  <dig> of  <dig> snps were accurately identified .

we then examined the distribution of nonredundant snps among different sets of annotated orfs using the cmcp <dig> reference genome. it must be emphasized that the vast majority of annotated orfs have not been experimentally verified; hence, such an analysis is conjectural. of the  <dig>  nonredundant snps in the cmcp <dig> genome from all four sequenced strains,  <dig>  fell within annotated orfs . this was not unexpected since this figure approximates the amount of the genome contained within annotated orfs  <cit> . however, other interesting trends were evident. there were highly significant differences in the frequencies of snps between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of cmcp <dig>  among the annotated orfs, there were  <dig>  snps/base for chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  snps/base in chromosome  <dig>  among the other sets of orfs, there were significantly more snps/base in the core genome  than in the total orfs  . as opposed to the inference that the core genome is actually more variable among strains, this difference most likely is due to the fact that the core genome, by definition, was shared among all of the sequenced strains; hence, had more shared sequences in which snps could be identified. in contrast, the lowest rate of snps was among the clade 2-specific genes, with only  <dig>  snps/base. in the opposite manner to the core genome, this result would be expected since the clade 2-specific genes are unique and shared among the set of three genetically related clade  <dig> strains and because only one newly sequenced clade  <dig> strain, m06-24/o, contributed to this particular snp pool. the frequency of snps in the clade  <dig> + 99- <dig> dp-b <dig> set of orfs was  <dig>  snps/base. the frequency of snps among hypothetical proteins  was significantly lower than that of the total orfs.

lineage-specific expansions
gu et al. <cit> . recently reported an analysis of numerous vibrio spp. to identify lineage-specific expansions , genes that have been duplicated within a species or genotype. some lses are specific to single strain, while others are present among varied strains across species. we examined some of the lses present in the reference genomes of v. vulnificus to determine if these loci are similarly present in the newly sequenced v. vulnificus genomes. we did not find a pattern to the presence or absence of the lses examined. for example, vv1_ <dig> and vv2_ <dig> form a pair of lse genes in cmcp <dig>  neither of these genes has a homologue in yj <dig> or any of the newly sequenced v. vulnificus genomes. in contrast, vv1_ <dig> and vv2_ <dig> constitute a pair of lses in cmcp <dig> that have homologues in yj <dig> . the vv1_2851/vv <dig> pair of genes has homologues in all of the four newly sequenced genomes, while vv2_ <dig> and vva <dig> do not.

discussion
this study is one of the first to use applied biosystems solid sequencing for genomic sequencing of bacteria. whole genome analysis has progressed considerably since the publication of the first complete dna sequence of the pathogenic bacterium haemophilus influenzae  <cit> . until recently, the wealth of complete genomes available in public databases was decoded via the large-scale industrialization of the sanger dideoxy chain-termination sequencing method  <cit> . the prospect of quickly and inexpensively resequencing large segments of the human genome or whole genomes of populations or species is driving development of a new generation of sequencing technologies with impacts in microbiology, functional genomics, ecology and evolutionary biology, human health, and beyond  <cit> . in particular, bacterial sequencing has been advanced by the high throughput, parallel format of the  <dig> sequencer  <cit> , the first 'next-generation' technology to de novo sequence and assemble whole bacterial genomes including mycoplasma genitalium in a single machine run  <cit> . bacterial comparative genomics has expanded rapidly owing to the speed of the  <dig> sequencer compared to sanger sequencing  <cit>  as well as from a combination of the two technologies  <cit> , while assessment of microbial diversity from complex communities   <cit>  has revealed insights into complex interactions such as mammalian obesity and the microbiome  <cit> , the ocean biosphere  <cit> , and the role of microbes in colony collapse disorder in honeybees  <cit> .

more recently released 'second-generation' sequencing technologies such the illumina ga2x genome analyzer  and abi solid system have been developed  <cit> . to date, these next generation sequencing technologies generate shorter read lengths than sanger sequencing, which poses a difficulty for de novo sequence assembly and defining large chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . so far in prokaryotes, high quality draft sequences have been assembled in the absence of sanger sequencing by combing the  <dig> and ga technologies  <cit> . studholme et al.  <cit>  utilized the illumina platform alone for the de novo assembly of the draft genome sequence of pseudomonas syringae pathovar tabaci strain  <dig>  revealing insights into the nature of type iii protein-mediated pathogenicity.

the improved throughput from the massively parallel format of the new platforms  is ideal for revealing patterns of genetic variation among individuals by resequencing. for example, srivatsan et al.  <cit>  employed illumina sequencing to improve the existing draft of the extensively studied model bacterium bacillus subtilis, while also identifying polymorphisms between other well studied laboratory strains and their isolates. moreover, this method was sensitive enough to identify typically difficult to isolate suppressor mutations in a single strain  <cit> . using the same platform, whole-genome analysis of  <dig> isolates of the monomorphic human pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhi revealed evolutionary loss of gene function consistent with the effects of genetic drift on a small effective population size  <cit> . resequencing of the caernohabditis elegans n <dig> bristol strain and snp discovery in another strain demonstrated the effectiveness of this technology in eukaryotes  <cit> , and single base mutations in a mutant c. elegans strain were mapped, avoiding traditional genetic mapping efforts  <cit> .

as one of the newer second-generation sequencers currently available, , the abi solid platform has been used more with eukaryotes than prokaryotes. one of the first studies focused on assessing cross-platform performance for sequence detection of known mutations in c. elegans. comparable accuracy between ga and solid for mapping the same c. elegans mutant strain as sarin et al.  <cit>  was reported  <cit> . similarly, comparable accuracy was reported between  <dig>  ga, and solid methods for comparing a mutant strain of yeast to a reference genome  <cit> . at present the utility of the solid platform is reflected in several resequencing studies in humans, including haplotype analysis, breakpoint mapping in disease-associated chromosomal rearrangements, and polymorphism discovery in protein coding exons  <cit> . with bacteria, solid sequencing has been limited to verifying an e. coli reference strain sequence in conjunction with traditional sequencing  <cit> , as well as resequencing of bacillus anthracis strains for rapid and accurate forensic typing  <cit> . in our presently described study, the solid platform was successfully utilized for rapid comparative genomic analysis of clade-specific and core genome sequences of the opportunistic pathogen v. vulnificus.

by examining the genomic dna of each of four v. vulnificus strains on one-fourth of a solid slide, we obtained  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> 35-nt reads. this level of sequencing yielded approximately 100-fold coverage of each genome. although the total numbers of reads would have predicted over 200-fold coverage, there was a significant amount of low complexity reads, as well as reads that were unmappable to the reference genomes.

we identified sequences that are unique to the highly virulent clade  <dig> strains. these  <dig> genes represent the set that could contain virulence genes that are responsible for the ability of clade  <dig> strains to cause systemic infection and death in subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mice . furthermore, we identified  <dig> additional genes that are common to the clade  <dig> strains and an unusual highly virulent clade  <dig> strain but absent from a typical attenuated clade  <dig> strain and a biotype  <dig> eel isolate. these  <dig> genes represent a very interesting set that could contain generally clade 2-specific genes that were acquired by a clade  <dig> strain and increased its virulence to that of typical clade  <dig> strains. among these putative virulence genes were genomic island xii identified by cohen et al.  <cit> , and most interesting was a set of genes involved with sialic acid catabolism. jeong et al.  <cit>  recently determined that the ability to utilize sialic acid for metabolism was essential for virulence of v. vulnificus. we are currently examining the possible roles of several of these loci in virulence.

at the time of our performing this genomic sequence analysis, we had not performed virulence studies of biotype  <dig> atcc  <dig> in our subcutaneously inoculated iron dextran-treated mouse model for infection. however, amaro et al.  <cit>  previously reported that atcc  <dig> was of modest virulence in a different mouse model involving intraperitoneal infection. based on our results indicating that atcc  <dig> lacked the genes shared among virulent clade  <dig> strains or clade  <dig> strains plus virulent clade  <dig> 99- <dig> dp-b <dig>  we hypothesized that atcc  <dig> would be attenuated for virulence in our model. in fact, when administered at the standard lethal dose of  <dig>  cfu for virulent strains, atcc  <dig> caused only minimally detectable skin infection in one of five mice. furthermore, when administered at  <dig> times the typical lethal dose , skin infection but no systemic infection or death ensued. therefore, our genomic analysis of atcc  <dig> correctly predicted its attenuated virulence. it should be noted that amaro and biosca  <cit>  reported that some biotype  <dig> strains are virulent for mammals, so the attenuation of atcc  <dig> was not a foregone conclusion.

because phenotypic differences are not only rooted in presence or absence of whole genes, but also nucleotide polymorphisms, we generated a set of snps among the shared sequences of the reference and newly sequenced genomes . by examining sanger-derived sequences for a subset of snps, we determined that  <dig> % of our reported snps are accurate. of the  <dig> snps examined, only two in one gene of one strain were not confirmed by sanger sequencing.

although the sample size of newly sequenced strains was small and each strain is a single representative of a unique genotype/virulence phenotype combination, some interesting relationships in snps were observed. most interesting, the rate of snps was significantly higher for genes encoded on chromosome  <dig> compared with chromosome  <dig>  given that chromosome  <dig> of vibrio is believed to encode most of the essential genes and that chromosome  <dig> is believed to have been acquired exogenously  <cit> , it is reasonable that the highest rate of polymorphisms would occur in the chromosome  <dig>  the number of snps between m06-24/o and the reference genomes was much lower than those from the other three genomes , even though there were slightly more genes identified in m06-24/o. because m06-24/o is in the same clade as the reference genomes, this result would be expected. significant differences were observed in the frequencies of snps among about every subset of genes examined, e.g., clade 2-specific, core genome, hypothetical proteins . however, it must be noted that the numbers of strains contributing to the snp pool for these subsets of genes differ between the sets. for example, the core genome is shared among all six strains, so all four newly sequenced strains contributed snps and could have generated a higher frequency of snps. in contrast, for the clade 2-specific genes, the only newly sequenced strain contributing snps, by definition of the subset, was m06-24/o.

by comparing the sequences shared among all six genomes, we identified the core v. vulnificus genome consisting of  <dig>  genes. gu et al.  <cit>  examined the genomic sequences of all vibrio species as of  <dig> and identified  <dig>  genes common to the genus. we are presently examining the core v. vulnificus genome to deduce possible metabolic and virulence characteristics of the species. we identified  <dig> genes previously unreported in v. vulnificus by using maq to compare the unmapped reads to the v. cholerae n <dig> genome. if the clade  <dig> or biotype  <dig> genomes possessed sequences with sufficient similarity to the v. cholerae genome, we should have been able to identify and assemble them exactly as we did for the v. vulnificus reference genomes.

most recently, chun et al.  <cit>  examined the genomes of  <dig> v. cholerae strains collected over  <dig> years. their newly sequences genomes were obtained using a combination of sanger and  <dig> sequencing. like us, they based their phylogenetic relationships primarily on presence or absence of orfs. their analysis enabled the division of that species into  <dig> lineages, with one comprising the o <dig> strains and the seventh pandemic comprising a nearly identical clade. they determined that horizontal gene transfer significantly contributed to the evolution of the species.

CONCLUSIONS
solid sequencing of multiple bacterial genomes of v. vulnificus and subsequent comparative genomic analysis identified numerous genes that are common to the most virulent strains yet lacking from attenuated strains for which genomic dna sequence data are available. these candidate virulence genes encode flp pili, ggdef proteins, and genomic island xii. sialic acid catabolism was similarly identified as a potential contributory factor in molecular pathogenesis. these intriguing results will likely lead to more thorough understanding of molecular pathogenesis of v. vulnificus.
