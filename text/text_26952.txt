BACKGROUND
plants have evolved a two-layered innate immune system against microbial and other pathogens  <cit> . in a first layer of defense, transmembrane pattern recognition receptors , usually with extracellular lrr-type domains, recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns  and initiate downstream signaling events including defense gene induction  <cit> , and lead also to cell wall reinforcement by callose deposition and snare-mediated secretion of anti-microbial compounds  <cit> . this is referred to as pamp- or pattern-triggered immunity .

successful pathogens have evolved virulence factors  that act in the apoplast or inside the host cell to overcome pti  <cit> . as a second layer of the innate immune response, many host plant lineages evolved intracellular r-proteins of the nb-lrr type that respond to virulence factors, either directly or through their effects on host targets  <cit> . plants producing a specific r-gene product are resistant towards a pathogen that produces the corresponding effector gene product , leading to gene-for-gene resistance  <cit> . this is referred to as effector-triggered immunity . rounds of eti and effector-triggered susceptibility  due to novel avr genes on the pathogen side can result in an evolutionary arms-race, generating a “zigzagzig” amplitude of host resistance and susceptibility  <cit> .

r-genes play a major role in defending crops against microbial infection and thus are of great interest in plant breeding programs and efforts to meet increased global food production. in potato, for example, r-proteins of the nb-lrr type confer resistance to the oomycete phytophthora infestans, a hemibiotrophic pathogen that causes late blight  <cit> . in arabidopsis, r-proteins of the nb-lrr type have been studied extensively in terms of molecular function, structural organization, sequence evolution and chromosomal distribution . this superfamily is encoded by scores of diverse genes per genome and subdivides into tir-domain-containing   and non-tir-domain-containing , including coiled-coil domain-containing  r-protein subfamilies  <cit> . for example, the tnl type r-protein rpp <dig> confers resistance to hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  in arabidopsis <cit> . similarly, the rps <dig> cnl type r-protein interacts in a gene-for-gene relationship with the avrpphb effector from pseudomonas syringae to activate innate immune responses  <cit> . the tnl type r-protein rrs <dig>  in concert with the tnl protein rps <dig>  confers resistance to the soil microbe ralstonia solanacearum in arabidopsis <cit> . the latter also contains a c-terminal wrky transcription factor-like domain for dna binding , increasing the number of domains common to nb-lrr clusters to five. this number is further extended by cases with presence of additional, c-terminal domains mediating extended gene function. for example, the arabidopsis nb-lrr locus chilling-sensitive <dig>  encodes a mutated allele of a c-terminal lim-type domain-containing tnl protein, leading to constitutive activation of defense responses and increased chilling susceptibility  <cit> . the nb-lrr adr1-l <dig> encodes an n-terminal rpw8-domain whose functional importance has previously been reported  <cit> . however, many rpw8-like genes encode transmembrane proteins without nb-arc-domain but impact on resistance to powdery mildew in arabidopsis.

tir- and non-tir nb-lrr protein clusters share a conserved central nb-arc-domain including three subdomains . together, these confer atpase function  <cit> . the c-terminal part of nb-lrr proteins harbors a leucine-rich repeat -domain for recognition of intracellular effector molecules upon infection, leading to a conformational shift within the nb-arc-domain  <cit>  upon recognition of the corresponding effector or a change in the surveyed plant protein. in the case of the soybean  cnl-class r-protein rpsk- <dig>  defense genes are induced upon phytophthora sojae effector recognition. this includes differential regulation of transcription factor activity as previously proposed .

a genome-wide comparison of multi-gene families in a. thaliana col- <dig> revealed a high frequency of gene duplication among the nb-lrr gene cluster and impact on genomic distribution  <cit> . for example, 63% of all reported nb-lrr genes are members of tandem arrays in both a. thaliana  and a. lyrata   <cit> . notably, nb-lrr loci are subject to positive selection  <cit> . in this context,  <cit>  re-assessed rates of molecular evolution for both sets of tandem and non-tandem  genes and found significant differences in selection rates. in this study, we went a step further by distinguishing the frequency of tandem and ohnolog duplicates to nb-lrr cluster expansion and diversity within a wider phylogenomics perspective, thereby covering an evolutionary timeframe of approximately  <dig> ma that corresponds to the radiation of core eudicots  <cit> . we compared the average rates of molecular evolution for singleton, tandem and ohnolog duplicate r-genes. we further provide evidence for strong positive, but significantly different, selection rates acting on all copy classes of nb-lrr duplicates, illustrating the impact of gene and genome duplication to the diversification of plant key traits across approximately  <dig> ma of genome evolution.

to elucidate the dynamics underlying pathway and trait evolution across multiple lineages, it is of paramount importance to identify and distinguish the complete set of orthologous and paralogous loci present within multiple genome annotations in a phylogenetic framework  <cit> . two homologous genes are referred to as orthologs if they descend from one locus present in the common ancestor lineage and diverged due to speciation  <cit> . by definition, orthologous genes are embedded in chromosomal segments derived from the same ancestral genomic region, thus sharing high inter-species synteny between closely related lineages  <cit> . in contrast, paralogous loci refer to homologs within one lineage and are due to, for example, tandem, transpositional- or whole genome duplications   <cit> . large-scale synteny is not observed for paralogs derived from small-scale events like tandem and transpositional duplication. in contrast, paralogs derived from wgds are located within intra-species syntenic genomic blocks, and can be referred to as ohnologs or syntelogs  <cit> .

recent analysis of genome-wide ohnolog distribution have revealed a common history of ancient, successive polyploidy events that are a common feature of genome evolution shared by all flowering plant linages  <cit> . for example, the arabidopsis lineage underwent at least five polyploidy events that we know of, two preceding and three following angiosperm radiation  <cit> . the most recent wgd event for the arabidopsis lineage is termed at-α and shared by all brassicaceae including the extant sister clade aethionemeae  <cit> . the older at-β wgd is shared by most species in the order brassicales, but occurred after the papaya lineage split  <cit> . the more ancient at-y event is a whole genome triplication  that is shared by most eudicots including all rosids, all asterids , grape  and more distant and basal clades such as gunnera manicata  and pachysandra terminalis   <cit> . in addition to ancient polyploidy events, more recent, species-specific wgds/wgts occurred in various lineages, such as genome triplications in b. rapa <cit>  , t. hasslerania   <cit>  and the solanaceae tomato genome  <cit> . hence, the “syntenic depth”  of the brassica rapa genome is 36x compared to the putative 1x eudicot ancestor . under consideration of two polyploidy rounds at or near the origin of angiosperms as well as 2x at or near the origin of seed plants  <cit> , the syntenic depth of the b. rapa genome would be expected to be increased to 144x .

polyploidy events also influence other kinds of duplication, thereby creating a network of factors with mutual influence. in brassica rapa , arrays of tandem duplicate  genes  fractionated dramatically after the br- α wgt event when compared either to non-tandem genes in the b. rapa or to tandem arrays in closely related species that have not experienced a recent polyploidy event  <cit> . errors in dna replication due to template slippage or unequal crossing-over can result in tandem duplication , producing tandem arrays  of paralog genes in close genomic proximity  <cit> . it is known that tar genes are enriched for genes functioning in biotic and abiotic stress  <cit> . for disease resistance, there are multiple taxa with an evident impact of td to trait evolution, including members of brassicaceae  <cit> , solanaceae  <cit>  and fabaceae  <cit> .

evidence is accumulating for the connection of ancient wgd events to birth and diversification of key biological traits. it was made evident that wgd is often followed by a genome-wide process of biased fractionation that preferentially targets one sub-genome to retain clusters of dose-sensitive genes often organized in functional modules . in brassicaceae, wgd shaped the genetic versatility of the glucosinolate pathway  <cit> , a key trait mediating herbivore resistance and thus highly connected to reproductive fitness of the population. similarly, starch biosynthesis in grasses, origin and diversification of seed and flowering plants as well as increased species survival rates on the cretaceous–tertiary -boundary are hypothesized to be linked to ancient polyploidy events .

in this study, we utilized an iterative approach by combining blast, hmm modeling and genomic contextual information provided by synteny to determine the fraction of tandem- and whole genome duplicate copies among all annotated full-length nb-lrr genes across twelve species in the context of a phylogenomics perspective, based on uniform standards facilitating comparisons. after utilization of duplicate classes, we assessed and compared rates of molecular evolution to describe a complex interplay of td and wgd events driving r-protein super-family extension, both of which expanded the evolutionary playground for functional diversification and thus potential novelty and success.

RESULTS
determination of protein domain-specific sub-clusters
encoded architecture of nb-lrr loci in plants is variable and can comprise up to seven different domains in arabidopsis . in contrast to previous studies  <cit> , we defined functional nb-lrr proteins as composite units sharing both nb-arc-domain and a lrr-domain signal due to at least one repeat. hence, tir-nb-, lrr-only, nb-only or tir-only proteins are not assigned as nb-lrr proteins by definition. to determine the number of nb-lrr loci within a given genome annotation, we combined layers of information provided by sequence homology, protein identity as well as genomic context of target genes in a custom, iterative approach using batch programming .figure  <dig>

in the first step, we identified putative orthologous  and/or syntenic  “anchor” genes  present in the most up-to-date genome annotations of  a. lyrata,  b. rapa,  e. parvulum,  ae. arabicum,  t. hasslerania,  c. papaya,  c. sinensis,  v. vinifera,  n. benthamiana, , s. lycopersicum and  s. tuberosum as well as  aligning to any gene present in the  a. thaliana col- <dig> tair <dig> genome annotation. this step resulted in a cluster dataset anchoring every gene family present in arabidopsis to all of the aforementioned lineages, hence providing valuable means for gene identification with any kind of target trait known in core-eudicot plants. subsequently, we screened for genes encoding  a lrr-domain,  a nb-arc-domain or  a tir-domain  . in a second step, we screened for anchor gene paralogs present in every aforementioned genome annotation to form an extended cluster of homologous genes containing at least one of the aforementioned domains . in a third step, we applied multiple machine learning methods  to filter false-positives to obtain three highly accurate, functional domain cluster  . we performed the third  step three times .

we identified  <dig>  genes encoding a lrr-domain in total . among those, the lowest number of genes containing a lrr-domain is  <dig> for the c. papaya genome annotation v <dig> . in contrast, the highest number of genes encoding a lrr-domain is  <dig>  for the c. sinensis genome annotation v <dig>  interestingly, both annotations share a syntenic depth of 1x representing the lowest-copy genomes subjected to our analysis . we identified  <dig>  genes encoding a nb-arc-domain in total . likewise, the lowest number was found within the c. papaya genome annotation v <dig>  . again, the highest number of genes encoding a nb-arc-domain was found in the c. sinensis genome annotation v <dig> . we identified a pool of  <dig>  genes encoding at least one tir-domain . similar to the aforementioned domains, the c. papaya genome annotation v <dig>  encodes the lowest number of tir-like loci . in contrast to the aforementioned cases, the a. lyrata annotation v <dig>   contains the highest number of encoded tir-domains . notably, the syntenic depth of a. lyrata is double that of papaya or orange.figure  <dig>

determination of nb-lrrmulti-gene family size by overlapping domain-specific sub-clusters
for every analyzed plant species, we determined the multi-gene family size of all annotated nb-lrr candidate genes by overlaying each filtered domain clusters. note that statements about target loci missing or flawed within the gene annotations are beyond the scope of this section, but can likewise be considered in silico by applying sequence scaffolds/contigs instead of gene models to our customized pipeline .

for the a. thaliana col- <dig> tair <dig> genome annotation, we have found  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr loci . previous studies found  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> nb-lrr loci present in the model plant. in contrast, tair <dig> domain annotation efforts reported  <dig> target loci  <cit> . the differences in our study resulted from usage of the updated tair <dig>  annotation and more stringent criteria; namely the exclusive combination of machine learning with sequence identity and consideration of the genomic context . for example, we focus on protein-coding genes only and ignore non-functional  loci due to the scope of this study to provide information relevant for breeding of gene-edited crops. moreover, we defined nb-lrr proteins as sharing both nb-arc- and lrr-domains, whereas many previous studies score anything as a nb-lrr gene that partially aligns to any one domain common to the cluster .figure  <dig>

l. solanum lycopersicum. please note that we required a nb-lrr gene to harbor both nb-arc- and lrr-domains.



for the a. lyrata genome annotation v <dig> , we identified  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr loci . previous studies reported evidence for  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit> nb-lrr loci present in the a. lyrata genome assembly. chen et al. score pseudogenes as well as loci that do not contain both nb- and lrr-domains, leading to the higher number of target genes than reported in this study  <cit> . the difference between our results and those of guo et al. is likely due to false-negative target genes with a divergence level that cannot be recognized by their applied hmm-generated nb-arc consensus sequence  <cit> . we were able to score these more divergent loci using synteny data anchoring locus determination and subsequent de novo domain prediction using a combination of  <dig> hmm algorithms . for example, the a. lyrata locus fgenesh1_pg.c_scaffold_ <dig> displays only moderate homology  to the closest related sequence in a. thaliana, a p-loop-containing nucleoside triphosphatase that is not defined as nb-lrr locus. however, we found both nb-arc- and lrr-domain within that gene in a. lyrata.

for the crop plant b. rapa , we found  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr candidate genes , while previous studies reported a sum of  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  target loci. the latter number includes proteins without lrr-domain . removing those, yu and coworkers identified  <dig> genes encoding both nb-arc- and lrr-domains,  <dig> less than we proposed. this differences may be due to our consideration of synteny and application of  <dig> different hmm algorithms, whereas yu and coworkers employed hmmer v <dig>  only  <cit> . note that mun and coworkers  <cit>  did not have the whole genome assembly available, and hence identified r-proteins based on  <dig>  partially redundant bac clones mostly from a single chromosome. the authors acknowledge a significant degree of sequence redundancy within the available dataset that covers 19-28% of the b. rapa genome only. likewise,  <cit>  performed ab-initio gene annotation based on the fgenesh algorithm only  <cit> , and solely use protein sequence homology  for r-protein homolog identification. in contrast, we used the whole gene-space assembly  as well as three layers of information for homolog identification .

to our knowledge, we performed the first analyses of r-proteins for e. parvulum, ae. arabicum, t. hasslerania and n. benthamiana. for the extremophile saltwater cress e. parvulum , we found  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr loci . for ae. arabicum, the extant sister lineage to all other mustard family members , we identified  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr loci . for the t. hasslerania genome annotation v <dig> , we identified  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr loci for this species , that underwent a lineage-specific genome triplication event  and has been established as the mustard family outgroup  <cit> . for the solanaceae and tobacco relative n. benthamiana, we identified  <dig> non-redundant nb-lrr proteins . notably, n. benthamiana is widely used as system for transient over-expression and silencing of various genes involved in plant innate immunity to elucidate downstream signaling events after pamp-mediated priming. in this context, our results provide accurate mapping of all nb-lrr –like sequences encoding functions characterized in a. thaliana down to the nicotiana gene-space assembly , thereby facilitating adjusted planning of aforementioned experiments and better understanding of results in the solanaceae.

for the crop plant c. papaya , we identified  <dig> non-redundant r-proteins of the nb-lrr type . among all species we have analyzed so far, the papaya gene-space assembly encodes the lowest number of r-gene candidates. we again acknowledge the possibility of incomplete gene annotations in this context . however, the low gene count of the nb-lrr locus family was previously revealed for the available papaya genes set  <cit> . the authors found  <dig> target loci using a combination of tblastx  <cit>  and the pfam hmm algorithm to search for the pfam nb  family pf <dig> domain  <cit> . the difference in gene-family size estimates is due to an updated genome annotation we have used, as well as more stringent criteria for target gene scoring .

our analysis revealed  <dig> non-redundant loci of the nb-lrr type for the crop plant c. sinensis  . evidence for the high r-gene count in orange has been noted previously. for example, the plant resistance gene database  lists  <dig>  r-genes  for this crop plant  <cit> , many of which are redundant. to our knowledge, our study comprises the first efforts to cross-reference both nb-arc- and lrr-domains among r-genes in orange.

for grape , we found  <dig> non-redundant r-proteins sharing both nb-arc- and lrr-domains . previous efforts identified  <dig> target genes  <cit> . the differences are due to an updated genome assembly as well as more stringent criteria for nb-lrr locus definition.

in addition, we subjected the potato crop  genome annotation v <dig> . <dig> to our customized pipeline for identification of homologous gene clusters. we identified  <dig> encoded non-redundant nb-lrr proteins within the potato genome . previous efforts identified  <dig> target genes  <cit>  from the annotated proteins set using the meme and mast algorithms  <cit>  as well as  <dig> target genes for the nb-lrr gene repertoire  <cit>  based on reduced representation analysis of dna enriched . referring to jupe et al.  <cit> , we acknowledge the inability of our pipeline to identify genes present in the crop but flawed or missing from the annotation or the assembly. the difference between our value and  <cit>  results from more stringent criteria in nb-lrr locus identification. for example, at least  <dig> of the  <dig> genes from  <cit>  do not contain both nb-arc- and lrr-domains, whereas at least two do not contain any of the required domains.

for tomato , we have found  <dig> non-redundant r-proteins of the nb-lrr type . previous studies identified  <dig> target genes sharing both nb-arc- and lrr-domains in a very conclusive approach  <cit> . the minor difference in numbers is due to a different build of the annotation based on the genome version  <dig>   and illustrates the thoroughness of the corresponding authors work. in contrast, application of renseq to tomato genomic and cdna recently identified  <dig> nb-lrr genes, thereby highlighting further potential of improvement for de novo genome assembly and annotation. again, we stress that the error rate of our pipeline depends on the quality of the input data .

in total, we identified  <dig>  r-proteins of the nb-lrr type. cds sequences are appended including translation to protein sequences. .

localization of genes with both nb-arc- and lrr-domains and determination of tandem duplicate fractions
we localized all reported nb-lrr loci onto the corresponding chromosomes/scaffolds/contigs present in all analyzed genome assemblies except n. benthamiana . application of a number of n =  <dig> allowed gene spacers  allowed determination of a global rate of 53% tandem duplicates . notably, we have found significant differences in tandem array fractions between the analyzed species . for example,  <dig> nb-lrr genes present in the v. vinifera genome annotation v <dig> are members of tandem arrays . in contrast, the n. benthamiana genome annotation v <dig> . <dig> contains only one fourth of tandem duplicates among all present nb-lrr loci. the latter represents a fragmented gene-space rather than a genome assembly, leading to a likely under-estimation of tandem duplicates fraction. hence, the global tandem duplicates fraction drops after inclusion of n. benthamiana loci . for the mean gene count per nb-lrr tandem array, aethionema scores highest. likewise, the extant mustard family sister clade contains the largest tandem array we found so far. in contrast, the largest orange  nb-lrr tandem array comprises less than half the number of target genes, leading to a very low genome-wide average of nb-lrr genes per tandem array for that species . please note that we required presence of both nb-arc- and lrr-domains for nb-lrr-type r-gene curation. therefore, some of the aforementioned tandem arrays may be further extended due to the presence of partial sequences in close proximity. we do not exclude a biological significance of such fragments per se, but set the scope to full-length candidate genes exclusively to obtain a uniform dataset to facilitate comparisons of molecular evolution rates .figure  <dig>

however, our data indicate that both aforementioned outlier situations with high  and low  maximums for gene counts per nb-lrr tandem array are outliers beyond the average degree of nb-lrr gene tandem array extension. the majority of all  <dig>  tandem duplicates  are organized in arrays with two genes only. three gene members per array occur in less than one fifth of all cases, whereas four, five and more than five genes per array occur with a cumulative frequency below 10% .figure  <dig>

genome-wide determination of retained ohnolog duplicate fractions and cross-referencing of nb-lrrgenes
we determined the genome-wide fraction of retained duplicate groups due to ancient polyploidy events , including all nb-lrr loci. screening of pairwise synteny blocks within the analyzed genome assemblies was accomplished using an integer programming approach implemented by the coge system for comparative genomics   <cit> . due to technical restrictions, this was possible for seven genomes . the high degree of tandem duplicates among r-proteins in all species results in a low degree of retained ohnolog duplicates by definition, because ohnologs mainly comprise groups of two or three duplicates, whereas tandem arrays can have up to eleven members . notably, the b. rapa genome possesses the highest syntenic depth value among all analyzed genome assemblies with 12x in total . consistently we found the highest fraction of retained ohnolog duplicates both genome-wide and among nb-lrr genes present in this crop with in total . in contrast, the potato crop  contains the lowest fractions of retained ohnolog duplicates for both genome-wide average and the set of nb-lrr genes . on average, about one third of all genes present in the seven analyzed genome assemblies comprise retained ohnolog duplicate groups. this fraction drops among all nb-lrr loci. this apparent under-representation of ohnologs among r-proteins highlights the high relative contribution of tandem duplication in r-protein cluster extension for the group of genome assemblies subjected to this analysis .table  <dig>

uncovering differential patterns of selection acting on subsets of nb-lrr loci pooled according to duplicate origin
we performed a genome-wide analysis of molecular evolution acting on all encoded nb-lrr proteins based on both the nb-arc- and lrr-domain. in a first step, we grouped  members of tandem arrays,  retained ohnolog duplicates as well as  singleton genes . by analyzing non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous sites, compared to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site , patterns of strong positive selection were uncovered among all three groups. strikingly, we also found differences in molecular evolution rates among all three groups. members of tandem arrays evolved fastest with a ω mean of  <dig> . in contrast, all analyzed retained ohnolog duplicates evolved with an intermediate rate . we reported the slowest rate of molecular evolution for singleton nb-lrr genes with a ω mean of  <dig>  . values for ω above one indicate positive or darwinian selection, less than one implies purifying  selection whereas ratios of one are indicative for neutral  selection  <cit> .figure  <dig>

assessing structural dynamics of genomic regions with conserved nb-lrrloci
utilizing the wealth of nb-lrr functional and molecular data available in arabidopsis as a reference, we composed a species-wide matrix of r-protein presence/absence based on sequence homology  and synteny . among the extended set of  <dig> distinct nb-lrr loci present in the model plant , we found four conserved clusters of “gatekeeper” genes sharing syntenic orthologs across all twelve analyzed genomes . please note that genomic regions displaying conserved synteny across lineages define evolutionary immobile parts of plant genomes  <cit> . for two among those, functional data are available in arabidopsis, whereas members of the other two gene clusters have not yet been characterized in any of the analyzed plant lineages.

the non-tir non-cc nb-lrr  class r-protein at3g <dig> is a “gatekeeper” because it forms one of four conserved clusters together with all of its aforementioned ohnologs . interestingly, there are yet no functional data available concerning this gene, neither in arabidopsis nor in any of the other eleven analyzed genome/gene-space assemblies.

for example, this nl-class “gatekeeper” at3g <dig>   <cit>  forms syntenic rbh pairs with fgenesh2_kg.3__ <dig> , bra <dig> , tp3g <dig> , aa_scaffold578_ <dig> , th <dig> , supercontig_ <dig>  , gsvivt <dig> , solyc03g <dig>   as well as pgsc0003dmg <dig> . for c. sinensis, the rbh partner orange <dig> g000782m is harbored by a very small scaffold  with three genes only, making the scoring of gene synteny impossible. however, the locus orange <dig> g000782m in turn forms rbh pairs with the aforementioned genes supercontig_ <dig>   as well as gsvivt <dig> , thereby closing the gap in a phylogenetic framework . likewise, the n. benthamiana gene nb00009911g <dig>  forms rbh pairs with the aforementioned syntenic orthologs in tomato and grape-vine, overcoming the lack of synteny data for this early-stage draft genome assembly . notably, the underlying locus underwent tandem duplication after grape-vine lineage split, leading to presence of a tandem array in all brassicales including orange, but an evident singleton gene in solanaceae and v. vinifera .figure  <dig>

. shown left is the phylogenetic relationship among all eleven species . shown right is the genomic context of the syntenic regions . the regions in focus include one nb-lrr gene that expanded to a tandem array in the arabidopsis lineage after split of solanaceae. diamond indicates a tandem duplication event. genes not overlapped by hsps are shown in green. in case of c. sinensis, the orthologous genes are harbored by a very small scaffold , therefore scaled differently from other panels in gevo.



the tir-nb-lrr -class “gatekeeper” locus at5g <dig> is anchoring another group of syntenic orthologs shared by all lineages . similarly, this locus lacks evidence on gene function in any of the analyzed plant lineages.

in contrast, conserved clusters b and c are anchored by zar <dig>  and the nb-lrr gene adr1-l <dig> , that confers pleiotropic effects in arabidopsis innate immunity . zar <dig> encodes a cc-nb-lrr  class r-protein of the flare group   <cit> . zar <dig> confers allele-specific recognition of the pseudomonas syringae hopz1a type iii effector in arabidopsis and acts independent of several gene products required by other r-protein signaling pathways  <cit> . in contrast, adr1-l <dig> overexpression results in a dwarf phenotype and activation of defense-related gene expression in arabidopsis <cit> . note that adr1-l <dig> encodes an r-protein conferring pleiotropic roles due to function as “helper” nb-lrr that can transduce signals subsequent to specific pattern recognition receptor activation during effector-triggered immunity  <cit> . furthermore, adr1-l <dig> encodes the n-terminal rpw8-like domain, whose functional importance in plant innate immunity has been previously reported  <cit> . interestingly, the arabidopsis rpw8-like “gatekeeper” was found to be necessary and sufficient to confer induced resistance to powdery mildew in the distant lineage of solanaceae   <cit> . this case excludes restricted taxonomic functionality and provides additional evidence for functional conservation of syntenic orthologs as defined by “gatekeepers” on a broad phylogenomics range.

in summary, we found four nb-lrr genes conserved in sequence as well as linked to structurally immobile parts of the core-eudicot pan-genome. at least one of those confers pleiotropic effects and extended functions in arabidopsis as a “helper-nb-lrr”  <cit> . although both synteny and sequence conservation across lineages during a timeframe of approximately  <dig> ma provides strong indications for conservation in function, this may not always be the case. however, we hypothesize that structural stability of the harboring genomic region supports evolution of pleiotropic effects conferred by “gatekeeper“ r-proteins .

the proliferation of high-throughput dna sequencing and genome informatics approaches enables an accelerated production rate of draft genomes from a wide phylogenetic sampling of plant taxa, highlighting a need for robust methods and a comparative framework for gene and genomic comparisons. we therefore have developed a custom approach to identify functional groups of plant proteins applying a novel and highly complementary combination of available algorithms and datasets. we have applied this to r-proteins and annotated  <dig>  loci of the nb-lrr type in total. this set contains genes that previously remained un-identified for all species except tomato and potato. for solanaceae, we stress that re-sequencing approaches based on complexity reduction such as target gene capture have been successfully applied for a similar purpose   <cit> . however, it is not unreasonable to assume that the onset of next generation sequencing and genome informatics will continue with acceleration beyond moore’s law and hence lead to more and better algorithms for de-novo generation of gene annotations. therefore, the added value of the computational pipeline shown in this study will rise with the same rate. for future references, we are working on customization of our approach to make it suitable for application to whole sequence scaffolds/contigs rather than sets of annotated genes/proteins. we intend to generate a computational pipeline for in-silico target gene capture based on scoring of combined hits outside the annotated gene-space within a size-window common to protein-coding genes, thereby overcoming the evident limitations of currently available algorithms for de-novo gene annotation . the pipeline shown in this study represents the first step towards this goal.

since tandem duplicates represent the majority of the r-gene duplicates that typically have a higher turnover rate, and additionally most of the r-genes have experienced high birth-and-death rate due to the persistent arms-race with the evolution of pathogen target effectors, most r-genes should have a fairly limited cross-taxonomic coverage  <cit> . however, a limited set of r-gene clusters are more stable, such as the four gene clusters that we have shown here to be conserved over  <dig> ma in most  core eudicot genomes. could these gene clusters represent shared immunity responses to common pathogens? in addition, the genes in these clusters could also act as “helper nb-lrrs”, mediating signal transduction downstream of various different nb-lrr receptors for activation during effector-triggered immunity, thereby leveraging functional constraints as previously made evident for adr <dig> family in a. thaliana <cit> . please note that members of the rpw8-domain-containing adr1-like family have been identified across all angiosperms, providing hints towards relevance of “gatekeepers” in a broad phylogenomics range across the whole angiosperm clade  <cit>  . more studies need to be done in order to unravel gene function underlying the retention of these unusually “stable” r-gene loci. this is stressed by the fact that  functional evidence accumulated for two of our four nb-lrr “gatekeeper” functions in arabidopsis; in at least one case ”gatekeeper” r-proteins confer pleiotropic effects as “helper” nb-lrrs. in contrast, such data lacks for the other two “gatekeepers”, notably including one tnl class r-protein. we hypothesize significant potential for extension of gene functional data regarding all four “gatekeeper” loci, either by gene-for-gene resistance towards yet-undiscovered pathogen effectors or by facilitating pleiotropic effects and effector-triggered signaling downstream of other nb-lrr genes similar to “helper nb-lrrs”. notably, a combination of both scenarios is evident in arabidopsis and hence not unreasonable to occur in other cases .

we highlight the need for “uniform” standards for comparative studies, such as the method we used in this study that is applicable but by no means limited to r-gene families. in contrast to most past computational pipelines of gene identification that only employ dna sequence similarity, our approach consolidates multiple tiers of evidence, including the basic protein sequence identity, domain compositions, and genomic context . uniform standards also ensure that our gene family member counts are directly comparable with one another, making in-depth studies of the expansion-contraction dynamics of gene families possible. furthermore, our method allows efficient screening of genome assemblies for near-complete curation of multi-domain and multi-gene family clusters. in the case of nb-lrr type r-genes, the resulting raw data provide a detailed overview of nucleotide diversity among all target genes within and between twelve lineages covering the whole core-eudicot clade. utilizing the wealth of genomics and gene functional data in a. thaliana, this leads to species-wise mapping  of every nb-lrr sequence present in the model plant. notably, these data can be used by breeders to identify both target loci as well as small rna sequence requirements for fast and efficient migration of resistance locus a to organism b using the emerging techniques of genome editing in case restricted taxonomic r-gene functionality doesn’t apply. for example, the particular nb-lrr gene conferring the desired resistance can be selected from our curated dataset followed by calculation of the smallest nucleotide distance  target gene in the desired organism. the sequence of the small rna necessary for engineering of nucleases in context of genome editing can be inferred accordingly in order to design a minimum set of experiments necessary and sufficient for gene-editing and thus generating an extended spectrum of resistance in any of the crop subjected to our analysis. however, note that taxonomic restrictions may apply for at least some encoded r-gene functions. going beyond plant innate immunity, we provide data on a network of anchor genes present in all analyzed genome assemblies, thereby referencing orthologs and paralogs of every gene family present in the model plant arabidopsis. we thereby excel future efforts to extract plant gene function, ultimately necessary for crop improvement and increased rates of global food production.

CONCLUSIONS
we highlight three major findings in this study:  higher frequency of tandem gene expansion in r-genes,  higher selection ratio in tandem duplicates compared to ohnologs and singletons and  evolutionary stable, orthologous r-gene clusters established within structurally immobile parts of plant genomes. those are likely to indicate a common functional constraint . r-genes typically show an unusually high turnover rate due to strong selection to keep up in a biological arms race with plant pathogens  <cit> . we suggest such r-genes follow a different evolutionary trajectory than genes with regulatory roles  <cit> . in this context, the added value of our study lies within the wide phylogenomics scope of the underlying approach. although similar findings are available in arabidopsis, monitoring dynamics underlying target gene evolution for approximately  <dig> ma  results in higher confidence in the validity of our inferences.
