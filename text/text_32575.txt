BACKGROUND
hedgehog  signaling is an evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathway which is essential for various aspects of embryogenesis including patterning events of the vertebrate neural tube and limb  <cit> . the mechanism of hh-signal transduction has been the target of intense studies but remains only partially understood. one of the striking features of hh signaling is that the primary cilium, a microtubule-based, immotile cellular protrusion, is essential for hh signaling in vertebrates but not in drosophila  <cit> . a requirement for the cilium in this pathway was first identified by genetic screening in mice for ciliary mutants exhibiting phenotypes similar to those of hh-pathway mutants  <cit> . however, subsequent genetic and molecular analyses demonstrated that cilium-dependency and the mediators of hh signaling varies between fish and mammals, raising a question about conservation and evolution of the mechanism of hh-signal transduction  <cit> .

the formation and maintenance of cilia depend on the conserved process of intraflagellar transport   <cit> . ciliary proteins are transported along the ciliary axoneme by ift machinery, driven by kinesin-based anterograde and dynein-powered retrograde transport. in the absence of ift <dig>  a component of anterograde ift machinery, both mouse and zebrafish embryos lack all cilia and exhibit a severe reduction in hh signaling. however, the phenotype is milder in zebrafish. in the neural tube, most of the hh target genes are not expressed in mouse mutants, while the expression of low-threshold genes remains and expands in zebrafish  <cit> , suggested that cilium is required for hh signaling also in fish, but the dependency on cilia is lower than that in mammals. however, it was still unclear how much hh signaling in fish depends on cilia and what is the underlying mechanism for that difference.

furthermore, fused , a putative serine-threonine kinase, first identified as an essential mediator of hh signaling in drosophila, turned out to be dispensable for mammals, but it is indispensable for zebrafish  <cit> . these facts suggest that the pathway in zebrafish is more similar to that in drosophila or placed in between drosophila and mammals, making fish a unique model with which to investigate the transition state from ancestral to modern type of hh signaling.

to further address this, we have generated a maternal-zygotic medaka mutant that lacks cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain  <dig> , an essential component of retrograde ift, and compared the neural phenotypes of medaka and mouse mutants . we confirmed that the requirement for cilia in hh signaling is lower in fish and revealed that the hh activity in fish depends on the length of cilium. additionally, ptch <dig> receptor is localized to cilia in fish as in mammals. subsequent analyses revealed that the difference in the requirement for cilia in hh signaling across vertebrates can be interpreted by differential regulation and function of fu.

RESULTS
generation of maternal-zygotic aa90/dhc <dig> mutants
the medaka aa <dig> mutant, isolated in an enu-induced mutagenesis screening  <cit> , is a recessive lethal mutant showing defects in left-right  axis determination . l/r asymmetry is established by directional flow of extra-embryonic fluid surrounding the node  by cilia. to identify the defective gene in aa <dig> mutant, we carried out positional cloning and narrowed down the aa <dig> locus to a 250 kb region in linkage group  <dig>  which harbors a single predicted open reading frame, cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain  <dig> , an ift retrograde component . we found that aa <dig> has a  <dig>  kb deletion in the dhc <dig> locus including the start codon, the heavy chain -hc, the hc-intermediate chain interaction domain, and the aaa atpase domain . database searches demonstrated that the dhc <dig> gene exists as a single copy within the medaka genome. due to long and complicated structure of the dhc <dig> gene , we were unable to perform a rescue experiment by rna injection. injection of antisense morpholinos  against the dhc <dig> gene into wild-type embryos significantly phenocopied aa <dig>  which led us to conclude that dhc <dig> is the gene deficient in the aa <dig> mutant .figure  <dig>

probably due to the maternal contribution of dhc2-gene products, the phenotype of aa90/dhc <dig> mutants was mild. for example, only one-fourth of the aa90/dhc <dig> homozygous mutants showed situs inversus . to completely eliminate dhc <dig> products, we have generated maternal-zygotic aa90/dhc <dig> mutants using the germline-replacement technique  <cit>  with some modifications . crosses of females with mutant germ cells and heterozygous males  generated 50% homozygous mutants that lacked both maternal and zygotic products of dhc <dig>  and 50% heterozygous mutant embryos that lacked only the maternal dhc <dig> contribution .figure  <dig>

as expected, the complete loss of dhc <dig> activity increased the frequency of situs inversus to  <dig> %  as well as enlarged ventricles and expanded nephric duct . moreover, the typical phenotypes of defective hh-signaling, severe ventral curvature and u-shaped somites instead of chevron-shaped ones, were observed in mzdhc <dig> mutants, but not in zygotic  or mdhc <dig> mutants , indicating reduced levels of hh signaling. importantly, the morphology of cilia was dramatically shortened as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy  . to expose the ventricular surface area of neural tubes, we exteriorized this area with forceps, prior to fixation  and found that cilia on the surface of non-floor plate  neuroepithelial cells  and longer ones on the fp cells  were much shorter and bloated in mzdhc <dig> than their wild-type counter parts . in the kupffer’s vesicle and somites, cilia were shortened in mzdhc <dig>  as compared with those in wt, mdhc <dig> and zdhc <dig>  the ciliary morphology in zdhc <dig> mutants appeared normal at least until the segmentation stages, but subtle defects in function or lately overt defects could account for their milder phenotypes . the ciliary phenotypes in mzdhc <dig> mutants are nearly identical to those in mouse dnchc <dig> −/−  <cit> , and thus the analysis of the hh activity in mzdhc <dig> mutants enabled us to examine differences and distinct mechanisms between fish and mouse in the requirement for cilia in hh signaling.figure  <dig>

patterning of the spinal cord in mzdhc <dig> mutants
in the neural tube, sonic hedgehog  ligand forms a dorso-ventral  gradient with the highest concentration ventrally, and specifies cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner  <cit> . thus, the expression of cell-type specific genes serves as a readout of hh activity and delineates domains in the ventral neural tube. roughly, from ventral to dorsal, gene expression is as follows: foxa <dig> in the fp, nkx <dig>  in p <dig> neuron precursors, olig <dig> in motor neuron precursors , nkx <dig> / <dig>  in p3/pmn/p <dig> progenitors, and pax <dig>  pax <dig>  dbx <dig> and dbx <dig> in dorsally located neuron precursors and their expressions are mutually exclusive underlined by their repressive interactions   <cit> . shh is known to induce the expression of the ventral genes , while suppressing the dorsal genes   <cit> . we first confirmed that shh was normally expressed in the medial fp  and underlying notochord of mzdhc <dig> mutants , suggesting that defects observed in mutants are mainly ascribed to signal transduction defects.

in mzdhc <dig> mutants, foxa <dig> and nkx <dig>  were expressed , whereas ventral intermediate genes, olig <dig>  nkx <dig>  and nkx <dig>  were dorsally expanded and this dorsal expansion was not observed in zdhc <dig> . dorsal expansion of olig <dig> expression in mzdhc <dig> was also observed at three different axis levels . the expression of these ventral genes suggests that the hh pathway is activated in cells with severely shortened cilia and even reaches the high levels of activation on the most ventral side. like zebrafish, foxa <dig> expression in the medial fp is hh-independent in medaka embryos , and thus we will use nkx <dig>  expression as a marker of the high level of hh activation. also, it is worth noting that the most ventral region appeared to be missing in mzdhc <dig> embryos, as the expression domains of nkx <dig> , separated by the negative medial fp cells, frequently merged in the medial region . however, due to the lack of a specific marker for this region, we were unable to determine a cell type specifically defective in mzdhc <dig> embryos.

the expansion of lower-threshold gene expression  also suggests that the area of low hh activation abnormally expanded dorsally in the mutant neural tube. this was further supported by dorsally retracted expression of pax <dig>  pax <dig>  dbx <dig> and dbx <dig>  observed in mzdhc <dig> mutants . in dnchc2-mutant mice, nkx <dig>  expression was reported to be lost, but olig <dig> was expanded  <cit> . thus, there are similarities and differences in the neural tube phenotypes between fish and mouse dhc <dig> mutants , both of which we addressed in the following experiments.figure  <dig>

lower hh pathway activation in mutant cells
to examine the activation level of hh pathway in mutant cells, we treated mzdhc <dig> embryos with various concentrations of cyclopamine, a potent antagonist of smoothened . intriguingly, in the mzdhc <dig> group, the percentage of nkx <dig> -positive embryos started to decrease at a cyclopamine concentration as low as  <dig>  μm, and went down below 50% at  <dig>  to 1 μm, while at such low concentrations, 100% of embryos maintained nkx <dig>  expression in the wild-type and mdhc <dig> groups . these results suggest that the activity of hh signaling in mutant cells is compromised at the level or upstream of smo, but still high enough to express the ventral-most marker, nkx <dig> .figure  <dig>

patched <dig> localizes to cilia in medaka fish
in murine cells, ptch <dig> receptor was reported to localize the primary cilium at least cultured cells and paraxial mesoderm cells  <cit> , whereas it is not the case in drosophila which does not require cilia for the reception of hh  <cit> . however, ptch <dig> localization was unknown in fish. to address this, we generated an antibody against medaka ptch <dig> , and examined the distribution of ptch <dig> in wild-type and mzdhc <dig> neural-tube cells. firstly, we confirmed that ptch <dig> expression in medaka is diminished by cyclopamine treatment  and in the morphants, the number of engrailed-expressing cells in somites was increased , similar to zebrafish morphant  <cit> .

as shown in figure 5c, ptch <dig> was localized to the cilia of neuroepithelial cells which are exteriorized with forceps before fixing  in wt. importantly, ptch <dig> was still localized to severely shortened cilia in mzdhc <dig> . the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by knockdown and overexpression experiments . these results indicate that the cilium is the site for hh receptor ptch <dig> localization in medaka.

mzdhc <dig> cells are less sensitive to shh
although the activation level of hh signaling is still sufficient to induce all target genes in mutant cells, the amount of ptch <dig> in severely shortened cilia is likely to be decreased. this could explain the higher sensitivity to cyclopamine in the above experiment . in other words, mzdhc <dig> cells could be less sensitive to shh. to test this idea, we transplanted wild-type cells into mzdhc <dig> blastula or mdhc <dig> , and examined olig <dig> expression when donor cells were localized in host neural tubes . we determined the genotype of mzdhc <dig> and mdhc <dig> by the eye phenotype at 16-somite stage when transplanted embryos were fixed for the analysis . remarkably, olig2-positive wt cells were frequently found in the region more dorsal to the host olig2-expression domain in mzdhc <dig> embryos , while no such ectopic expression was detected in control transplants . these results demonstrate that hh-activation of mzdhc <dig> cells is lower than that in wt cells, even if they are exposed to the same concentration of hh-ligand.

fused forms a positive-feedback loop in fish
the presence of nkx <dig>  expression is unique in mzdhc <dig> as mouse dnchc <dig> mutants lose nkx <dig>  expression  <cit> . the same tendency was observed in ift <dig> mutants that completely lack cilia; only zebrafish mutants maintain the expression of intermediate genes like olig <dig>  <cit> , implying that the activation of hh signal is enhanced in fish. to explore a teleost-specific mechanism, we focused on fused , an intracellular mediator of hh signaling downstream of smo in drosophila, which has evolved divergent roles in the vertebrate lineage: one for hh signaling and the other for ciliary motility. interestingly, murine fu is dispensable for hh signaling and specifically participates in the motility of cilia, whereas it is required for both in zebrafish  <cit> . we first tested if fu is essential for hh signaling in medaka by injecting fu mo  targeted to the splicing site  and observed the loss of nkx <dig>  expression . additionally, morphants injected together with fu mrna rescued nkx <dig>  expression  and injection of fu mrna into wt embryos elevated hh activity as indicated by the expansion of the ventral intermediate genes, olig <dig> and nkx <dig>  . we then knocked down fu in mzdhc <dig> mutants to see if the remaining expression of hh target genes in those mutants also depends on fu. however, under our experimental conditions, most of the mzdhc <dig> mutants injected with fu mo  died probably due to a requirement of fu in earlier development  <cit> , and we therefore reduced the concentration of fu mo , when injected into mzdhc <dig> mutants. these injected mzdhc <dig> embryos failed to express nkx <dig>  . interestingly, the expansion of the ventral intermediate gene, olig <dig>  was also rescued . these results demonstrate that fu is indispensable for hh signaling in wild-type and mutant medaka embryos and its overexpression augments the signal.figure  <dig>

fu is known to be expressed ubiquitously in zebrafish at early developmental stages  <cit> , but the precise pattern and regulation of fu expression during neural tube patterning have not been reported. our further analysis revealed that fu expression is restricted to the ventral part of neural tube where high to low levels of hh signaling are activated at 16-somite stage in medaka . furthermore, fu expression was dorsally expanded in mzdhc <dig> neural tubes , like the ventral intermediate genes. these results suggest that fu is a transcriptional target of hh signaling. to test this possibility, we treated wild-type embryos with 5 μm cyclopamine and observed severe reduction or loss of fu expression in cyclopamine-treated embryos , indicating that fu expression is induced by hh signaling downstream of smo. we also confirmed that fu expression in zebrafish is ventrally restricted in the neural tube and depends on hh signaling .

we finally asked if fu, when overexpressed, can restore hh signaling, when smo-mediated signaling is compromised. for this, embryos were treated with  <dig>  μm cyclopamine  together with fu mrna injection. those injected embryos showed weak but significant up-regulation of nkx <dig>   as compared with cyclopamine-treated control embryos  , suggesting that fu augments hh activity downstream of smo. given that fu is a positive mediator of hh signal transduction, fu is likely to form a positive feedback loop downstream of smo to reinforce hh signal in teleost target cells .figure  <dig> 
proposed model of the distinct features of hh signal transduction in insect, fish and mammal.
fu is expressed in a hedgehog-dependent fashion and is also one of the components of the hedgehog pathway in fish. fused negatively regulates suppressor of fused , which is a negative regulator of gli/ci in hh signaling. the transcription of fused in fish could lead to hh activation. this positive-feedback loop amplifies hedgehog pathway in fish downstream of cilia.



discussion
in the present study, utilizing the medaka mutant with severely shortened cilia, mzdhc <dig>  we demonstrated that shorter cilia mediate less hh activation in fish. this result suggests that they mediate hh signaling in a length-dependent manner. we also found that ptch <dig> receptor is exclusively localized on the cilium in fish. these are largely consistent with the observation of murine ciliary mutants. furthermore, the present study has addressed why the expression of low-threshold target genes is expanded in mutant neural tubes and how hh signal is augmented in fish mutant cells.

a possible role for cilia in hh gradient formation
olig2-positive wild-type cells in mutant neural tubes were positioned more dorsally than dorsal boundary of olig <dig> expression in wild-type neural tubes . this result, though indirectly, suggest that the gradient profile of hh ligand dorsally shifts in mutant neural tubes.

dorsal expansion of shh ligand was directly observed with smoothened mouse mutants  <cit>  and this can be interpreted as a consequence of the reduced amount of ptch <dig> receptor, a downstream target of hh signaling. indeed it has been proposed that the shh gradient is regulated by a shh-induced negative-feedback mechanism in which ligand binding to ptch <dig> at the cilia sequesters hh ligand itself in the intercellular space  <cit> . it is thus conceivable that in ciliary mutant neural tubes, the reduced amount of ptch <dig> on cilia caused a dorsally shifted hh gradient, and thereby the expression domain of ventral low-threshold target genes is expanded, although further confirmation by direct imaging is required. consistently, the neural tube in dnchc <dig> mutants also exhibits the expansion of low threshold gene expression  <cit> . thus in vertebrates, the length of cilia could be one of the factors that affect the hh gradient in the neural tube. of course, we still cannot rule out the possibility that wild-type cells, when placed in mutant background, become more sensitive than those in a control background.

teleost-specific augmentation of hh pathway mediated by fused
in the present study, we propose that fu is a key to account for the difference in activation level between mammals and fish in ciliary mutants. fused is a crucial mediator of hh signaling in drosophila and zebrafish, but not in mammals  <cit> . we first confirmed that fu was required for hh signaling in medaka like zebrafish, and next found that the expression of fu in neural tube is restricted to the ventral part and induced by hh signaling in fish. subsequent analyses demonstrated that fu forms a positive-feedback loop downstream of smo ; fu activates the hh pathway which then leads to the up-regulation of fu. the positive feedback centered by fu could augment hh signal in ciliary mutant cells with lower input of smo-mediated signaling. this could thus explain why the phenotype of fish ciliary mutants are milder than that of mammalian counterparts. of course, fu may not be a mere component that differentiates the ciliary dependency in the two vertebrate models. indeed, in zebrafish, low levels of hh activation mediated by gli <dig> are known to occur in a hh-independent manner and its mechanism remain elusive  <cit> .

what is the biological and evolutionarily significance of the positive-feedback mechanism in hh signaling. a hint could be found in the speed and mode of neurulation in fish. according to the recent report by xiong et al.  <cit> , specification of neural cell types in zebrafish begins earlier and proceeds faster under the noisy conditions of cell movements in the formation of the neural keel. whereas in other vertebrates, such as chick and mice, neurulation proceeds gradually and steadily in an epithelialized cell sheet, following an established shh gradient. a rapid and amplified response to shh in target cells would thus be necessary in fish neurulation. xiong et al. also showed that specified neural progenitors sort to form sharply bordered domains from mixed progenitor populations. however, this apparently contradicts our transplantation result showing ectopic expression of a specific marker in wild-type donors , suggesting that multiple strategies, including sorting and position-dependent determination, are employed to achieve a robust pattern. recently, the presence of cilium-mediated signaling was reported in the olfactory epithelium of drosophila  <cit> , suggesting the evolutionarily ancient origin of this mechanism. thus, further analysis of hh signaling in diverse species and tissues will provide greater insight into the evolution of this crucial signaling pathway.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study strengthens the idea of a conserved role of primary cilia in hh-signal transduction in vertebrates, but also uncovered a teleost-specific augmentation mechanism mediated by fu. the fish-specific augmentation can serve as the mechanism that accounts for the lower cilia-dependency for hh signaling in fish and gives novel insight into the evolution of hh signaling.
