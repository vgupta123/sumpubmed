BACKGROUND
much of the study of the human microbiome has concentrated on those indigenous bacterial communities inhabiting different body surfaces  <cit> , but relatively little effort has been focused on viruses  <cit> . recent studies have identified communities of viruses inhabiting the human oral cavity  <cit> , the respiratory tract  <cit> , skin  <cit> , and the intestinal tract  <cit> . while the role of viruses in these communities has yet to be thoroughly examined, a common feature shared among these body surfaces has been that most of the viruses identified have been bacteriophage  <cit> . because bacteria generally outnumber human cells in these environments, bacteriophage might also be expected to outnumber eukaryotic viruses. many of the viruses present in these communities have been predicted to have primarily lysogenic lifestyles, carrying gene function that might facilitate the pathogenic functions of their host bacteria  <cit> .

biofilms contain complex aggregates of microorganisms growing on self-produced solid surfaces, whose constituents and cellular activity may differ substantially from planktonic communities  <cit> . the oral biofilm is known to be inhabited by numerous species of bacteria and archaea  <cit> , but has not been shown to be inhabited by communities of viruses. because of the potential difficulty in traversing solid surface biofilms, dental plaque has been hypothesized to be relatively devoid of viruses  <cit> , however, some viruses have previously been identified in dental plaque  <cit> . given the abundance of bacteria residing within plaque, we hypothesize that dental plaque may have an indigenous viral community.

the human oral cavity contains many microenvironments in which the microbiota are known to differ  <cit> . there are characteristic differences in the relative abundances of bacteria in subgingival plaque, supragingival plaque, saliva, buccal mucosa and on the tongue. there also are shifts in oral bacteria that can be traced to diet  <cit>  and oral health status  <cit> . because of the proximity to tooth surfaces, many have sought to characterize subgingival microbiota in conditions such as chronic periodontal disease  <cit>  and dental caries  <cit> , as those communities harbor microbes that might contribute to oral inflammation and the subsequent development of disease. whether viral communities are part of the biofilm microbiota or contribute to oral inflammation has not previously reported.

characterization of human viral communities has generally been limited by a relative dearth of homologous sequences available to identify metagenome contents  <cit> . most of the studies characterizing human viral communities have viromes in which greater than half of the constituents are without homologues  <cit> . other studies have used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats  in bacteria, which acquire short sequences from the viruses to which they are exposed  <cit> , as a means to augment analysis of human viral communities. some dental plaque biota are known to possess crispr/cas systems  <cit> , suggesting that they can adapt to invading viruses. we believe that there are uncharacterized populations of viruses inhabiting the oral biofilm that may have unique features when compared to planktonic viruses in saliva. in this study, we sought to detail the presence of viral communities populating dental plaque, to determine whether oral viruses might be subject specific or specific to oral sampling site, and to characterize the potential capacity of oral streptococci to counteract their viruses by profiling crisprs.

RESULTS
isolation and sequencing of dental plaque viromes
although some viruses have previously been isolated  <cit> , it is not known whether dental plaque is inhabited by a community of viruses as has been shown for saliva  <cit> . to determine whether there existed a population of viruses in dental plaque, we evaluated plaque from  <dig> human subjects with good overall periodontal health . we collected plaque in a biogeographic manner from tooth # <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . virus-like particles  were visualized from dental plaque using epifluorescence microscopy and were present at an estimated  <dig> vlps per gram of plaque for all subjects . comparatively, there were  <dig> vlps per ml of saliva in these same subjects,  <dig> in the lower respiratory tract of other human subjects,  <dig> in blood,  <dig> in the vagina, and  <dig> in the human gut virome  <cit> .

viromes were enriched from the dental plaque of each subject similar to our previously described protocols for isolating dna viruses from saliva  <cit> . we sequenced  <dig> , <dig> virome reads from all subjects  using semiconductor sequencing  <cit> . all viromes were screened for contaminating cellular nucleic acids by blastn analysis against a human reference database and a composite database of 16s rrna. no homologues were identified among the viromes to 16s rrna, indicating that these viromes were relatively free of contaminating bacterial dna . a small number of reads homologous to human dna were identified in the dental plaque virome of subject # <dig> , and were removed prior to further analysis.

characterization of plaque viromes
to characterize the viral populations present in dental plaque, we assembled the virome reads from each subject and sample type, and searched the ncbi nr database for homologous sequences. a substantial proportion of each virome was homologous to known viruses , with >99% of the viral contigs representing bacteriophage. circoviruses and herpesviruses were the only human viruses identified, and each represented only a minority of the population. the distribution of structural, virulence, and replication genes amongst the bacteriophage present was similar for both saliva and dental plaque, where the most commonly identified phage genes were polymerases, helicases, integrases, tail fibers, and hypothetical genes in both sample types . many virome contigs had no known homologues, while others were homologous to bacterial genomes. further analysis of these viromes demonstrated that many of the sequences identified as homologous to bacteria were actually homologous to un-annotated phage or hypothetical genes within prophage in bacterial genomes. for example, many of the reads from subject # <dig> map to a small segment of streptococcus gallolyticus ucn <dig> , which represents a prophage. similar findings were found for subject # <dig>  where many of the reads map to un-annotated genes in a prophage within the s. pseudopneumoniae is <dig> genome . as many of the genes in these prophage were not annotated, they appeared as homologues only to the bacterial genomes. there were few reads in either virome that mapped to portions of s. gallolyticus or s. pseudopneumoniae genomes outside of these prophage. reads from each subjects and sample type also mapped specifically to the crispr loci of s. gordonii challis ch <dig>  and  <dig> separate s. thermophilus isolates . none of these virome reads had any identifiable crispr repeat motifs, which further supports that they were viral in origin rather than from bacteria. all of the crispr spacers in s. gordonii challis ch <dig> matched virome reads from subject # <dig> and # <dig>  indicating that viruses matched by those crispr spacers were prevalent in those subjects.we also compared the viromes from each subject to a database of known bacteriophage to determine whether similar phage might have been present in the oral cavities of each subject. many reads mapped to actinomyces phage av- <dig> from dental plaque in subject # <dig> , to streptococcus phage dp- <dig> in subject # <dig> , to enterobacteria phage p <dig> in subject # <dig> , and to enterobacteria phage lambda in subject # <dig> . over 6%  of the virome from the plaque in subject # <dig> mapped to a short segment of enterobacteria phage p <dig> containing a transposon encoding tetracycline resistance.

viral and bacterial community composition by subject and sample type
we compared the constituents of each virome to determine whether there were characteristics specific to each subject or sample type. we found some viral contigs that were homologous across all subjects, indicating that viruses sharing similar sequence features were present in each subject and sample type . we used principal coordinates analysis to determine whether virome composition might be influenced by subject or sample type. both the dental plaque and saliva viromes were highly reflective of their host environment .

we also characterized the bacterial community composition in each subject and sample type by analysis of the v <dig> region of 16s rrna. we sequenced  <dig>  reads  from each subject and sample type . rarefaction analysis demonstrated that the preponderance of bacterial diversity had been sampled in each subject and sample type . contrary to the subject-specific results found for viruses in the oral cavity , sample type was an important determinant of oral bacterial ecology .

we quantified the proportion of homologous reads between viromes to determine whether patterns of variations observed in principal coordinates analysis were statistically supported. using a permutation test, there was substantial intra-subject homology between saliva and dental plaque . the proportion of intra-subject shared viral homologues were statistically significant for subjects # <dig>  # <dig>  and # <dig> . there also was significant homology for inter-subject comparisons of dental plaque , but was not observed for saliva. these data indicate that both sample type and individual host environment were important determinants of oral viral ecology.

abased on the mean of  <dig>  iterations.  <dig>  random reads were sampled per iteration.

bempirical p-value based on the fraction of times the estimated percentage of homologous reads for each subject or sample type exceeds that for different subjects or sample types. p-values ≤ <dig>  or less are highlighted in bold.

streptococcal crispr profiles in dental plaque
we previously profiled streptococcal crisprs in the saliva of a cohort of human subjects and identified many matching viral sequences in those same subjects  <cit> . we evaluated the same streptococcus group i  and streptococcus group ii  crisprs, both of which represent type ii crispr/cas systems in each species  <cit> . these repeat motifs have been identified in numerous different streptococcal species   <cit> . we sequenced  <dig>  sgi and  <dig>  sgii crispr spacers from each subject and sample type , and binned spacers according to their trinucleotide content to account for any potential polymorphisms or sequencing errors  <cit> . when examining spacer content, only  <dig> % of sgi and  <dig> % of sgii crispr spacers were estimated to have any polymorphisms .

we examined the distribution of crispr spacers to determine whether similar spacer profiles were present in each subject and sample type. for each subject, there were sgi and sgii spacers shared between plaque and saliva, but there also were some that were unique to each sample type . the patterns of variation observed in crispr spacers were highly reflective of their host environment for both sgi and sgii spacers , similar to results found for viromes . we also quantified the level of shared spacers between subjects. when the relative abundance of spacer sequences was considered, there was a significant  proportion of shared spacers within each subject , with the exception of subject # <dig> sgi crisprs . no significant proportions of shared crispr spacers were found when compared by oral sample type.

abased on the mean of  <dig>  iterations.  <dig>  random spacers were sampled per iteration.

bempirical p-value based on the fraction of times the estimated percentage of shared spacer groups for each subject or sample type exceeds that for different subjects or sample types. p-values ≤ <dig>  are highlighted in bold.

crispr spacers from dental plaque match oral viruses
we tested whether the sgi and sgii crispr spacer sequences had homologues in the ncbi nr database, and found many homologous to streptococcal viruses, genomes, and plasmids in each subject and sample type . while none of the sgi and sgii spacers were identical, many had exact matches to the same streptococcal viruses and plasmids . streptococcus phage sm- <dig> , ph- <dig> , and cp- <dig>  were amongst the most highly matched viruses by crispr spacers from dental plaque. different portions of the same genes in these phage were matched by both sgii and sgi spacers. for example, in phage ph- <dig>  the repressor, endonuclease, pro-head, tape measure, and endolysin were all matched by sgii  and sgi  spacers derived from plaque. we also mapped sgi and sgii crispr spacers to the genomes of many oral streptococci and also found exact matches to putative prophage in streptococcal genomes. for example, both sgi and sgii crisprs matched a known prophage in s. mitis b <dig> and multiple prophage in s. pneumoniae 670-6b . many of these matches were derived from plaque-derived crispr spacers  and occurred across the genome sequences of each prophage.to determine whether crisprs from each sample type matched viruses from each subject, we compared virome and crispr data. matches to virome reads were defined as exact matches to any spacer within a spacer group. because the percentage of virome read/spacer matches was low, we combined viromes from all subjects prior to the analysis. we found that there were numerous sgi and sgii spacers that matched virome reads from the oral biofilm . we also examined the patterns of crispr spacer/virome read matches to determine whether there was evidence for subject- or sample type-specific patterns. the patterns of spacer/virome matches observed reflected subject but not sample type specificity . the crispr spacer data were complimentary to the observed subject-specific patterns observed in viromes.

discussion
our analysis of the viral communities in dental plaque provides insights into relatively unexplored aspects of the microbiota inhabiting the complex oral ecosystem. while the relative paucity of biomass at each tooth precluded analysis of individual teeth, the pooling of dental plaque allowed for analysis of the viruses present. the sampling and analysis of the microbiota in dental plaque and saliva has been performed and reported on for many years  <cit> , and the overlap in the viral communities observed between each likely reflects some overlap in the resident bacterial biota from both sites. in support of this hypothesis is the substantial proportion of shared crisprs spacers that likely reflect sampling of the same bacteria from both sites in each subject .

the vast majority of the viruses found in this study and others describing human viromes  <cit>  have been identified as bacteriophage, with only a few eukaryote viruses including herpesviruses and circoviruses identified. characterization of bacteriophage from viromes generally has been limited due to a lack of available homologous sequences. the proportion of contigs without homologous sequences in this study was greater than 50% in some viromes, similar to proportions found in other studies  <cit> . we identified numerous homologues to known viruses  and found that many spanned the entire genome sequences of known viruses , which reinforced that there likely were full-length viral genomes present in dental plaque. further study with a broader group of participants would be required to define what role viruses may play as members of the dental plaque microbiome.

we explored both bacterial and viral ecology to provide a more comprehensive view of the microbial inhabitants of plaque. while viral ecology was reflective of the subject from which they were derived , the bacterial ecology was more reflective of sample type . the membership of the dental plaque viral communities differed from planktonic saliva in all subjects, although there were homologous sequences between saliva and plaque in each subject . the significant proportion of homologous sequences for intra-subject comparisons of viromes and for inter-subject comparisons of dental plaque, suggests that oral viral ecology is influenced by both individual host environment and sample type. there were a significant number of vlps present in both saliva and dental plaque, which were greater than most other body surfaces. the substantial population of phage present in plaque combined with the high numbers colonizing mucosal surfaces  <cit> , increases the complexity of comparing relative abundances of oral phage with their putative bacterial hosts.

we studied crisprs in the dental plaque of our cohort, as their spacer sequences reveal sequence features of viruses that oral bacteria may counteract. the similar crispr profiles in both saliva and plaque likely reflect shared bacterial inhabitants in both niches. the overall trend in shared crispr spacers reflected a subject-specific rather than a sample type specific pattern in all subjects . the crispr and virome data together demonstrate distinct ecological differences between subjects, and supports that both oral biogeography and the individual host environment are significant determinants of oral viral ecology. we previously have identified short proto-spacer-adjacent motifs  that are used to recognize and select spacers from invading dna for both sgi and sgii spacers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
as we continue to characterize human microbial communities, we must account for the complexities of biogeography and its potential contribution to an individual’s microbial ecology. our analysis of dental plaque has uncovered the presence of a community of viruses, whose constituents share some overlap with those of planktonic saliva. despite that many of the viral contigs identified were unique to either saliva or dental plaque, the overlap observed in the saliva and plaque of individual subjects suggest that there may be shared viruses across each biogeographic site. the analysis presented here provides an additional framework for understanding human oral viral ecology, and demonstrate that oral viruses may be relatively personal features of the human microbiome.
