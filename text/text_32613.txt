BACKGROUND
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus , the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in swine, is a positive-stranded rna virus of the arteriviridae family in the order nidovirales. prrsv causes highly significant losses to the swine industry worldwide as a result of both reproductive failure  in pregnant sows and respiratory disease  in pigs of all ages  <cit> . infection with prrsv also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens, and is a key etiological agent of porcine respiratory disease complex  <cit> . prrsv has a tropism for host cells of a phagocytic lineage, especially porcine alveolar macrophages . the major obstacles to controlling prrsv include genetic and antigenic variation of the virus and the dysregulation of the host response  <cit> . despite extensive research, currently available prrsv vaccines are not protective against all field strains, resulting in less-than-perfect control programs. unraveling the mechanisms of prrsv and cell interactions will be a critical step in developing predictable control and prevention strategies.

viral infection is often accompanied by an alteration of the intracellular redox state. a feature of many viral infections includes increased generation of reactive oxygen species , which include superoxide, singlet o <dig>  h2o <dig>  and the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. ros are often viewed as etiologic in producing cellular injury. maleic dialdehyde  is the peroxidation product of ros and also a major marker of cell oxidative stress injury. ros modulate the permissiveness of cells to viral replication and regulate host inflammatory and immune responses, ros and mda result in oxidative damage to both host tissue and the virus  <cit> . there are several reports documenting generation of ros during viral infection. for example, infection with herpes simplex virus, paramyxovirus, influenza virus, hepatitis virus, or hiv, oxidative stress and free radical generation contribute to the pathogenesis of disease  <cit> . ros can attack many kinds of unsaturated fatty acids on biological membranes causing lipid peroxidation effects, which can induce cellular effects such as nuclear factor kappa b  activation  <cit> .

nf-κb belongs to a family of inducible transcription factors involved in pathogen- or cytokine-induced immune and inflammatory responses, as well as cell proliferation and survival  <cit> . the members of the nf-κb family in mammalian cells include p50/p <dig> , p <dig> , p52/p <dig> , c-rel, and relb. all of these proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the rel homology domain that is responsible for dna binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of nf-κb  <cit> . classical nf-κb exists as heterodimers consisting of a 50-kda subunit  and a 65-kda subunit   <cit> . under normal physiological conditions, nf-κb is sequestered in the cytoplasm as inactive complexes by its interaction with a member of the inhibitory kappa b  family. when stimulated with a wide range of pro-inflammatory stimuli, the iκb proteins are phosphorylated by iκb kinase  and degraded in proteasomes. the subunit of nf-κb p <dig> is then phosphorylated while exposing its nuclear localization signal sequence , leading to nuclear translocation and subsequent binding of nf-κb to dna regulatory elements of the target genes involved in biological functions  <cit> . the purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between reactive oxygen species  and nf-κb during prrsv infection in marc- <dig> cells. the results of this study contribute to our understanding of the interaction between prrsv and target cells from an oxidative stress point of view.

methods
ethics statement
this study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health. the protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments of the yunnan agricultural university. all surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

cells and virus
the marc- <dig> cell line, a prrsv permissive cell line, were cultured and maintained in dulbecco’s modified eagle medium  supplemented with  <dig> % heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum ,  <dig> μg/ml fungizone, 100u/ml penicillin, 10μg/ml streptomycin and 5μg/ml gentamicin and held at  <dig> °c in a humidified  <dig> % co <dig> incubator.

the prrsv isolate yn- <dig>  was isolated and propagated in marc- <dig> cells. the  <dig> % tissue culture infectious dose was determined using the reed and muench method. virus stocks were prepared with a low passage isolate. for virus infection, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> 

virus isolation
tissue samples, including lung and lymph node  were collected from pigs in the yunnan province of southwest china in  <dig>  pigs displayed typical symptoms of prrs, including labored breathing, pyrexia, lethargy, and anorexia. standard methods for virus isolation were performed for lung and ln tissue homogenates. briefly, serial 1: <dig> dilutions of homogenate were added to confluent marc- <dig> cells. cells were maintained at  <dig> °c with  <dig> % co <dig> and monitored daily for cytopathic effects . the culture supernatants were harvested when cpe appeared in  <dig> % of the cells. the isolated prrsv stock, termed yn- <dig>  was stored at − <dig> °c for further experiments.

in addition, an indirect immunofluorescence assay  was carried out with the commercial prrsv monoclonal antibody sdow- <dig> . marc- <dig> monolayer cells were washed once with pbs, fixed in  <dig> % acetone for  <dig> to  <dig> min, and air dried. for detection of the prrsv, the primary antibody sdow- <dig> and secondary antibody goat anti-mouse igg-fluorescein isothiocyanate  conjugate  were added to each well respectively. after  <dig> to  <dig> min of incubation, the antibody was aspirated and monolayers were washed three times with pbs prior to viewing under a fluorescence microscope.

primer design and rt-pcr
in order to determine the full-length genomic sequence of the prrsv isolate designated yn- <dig>  primers were first selected based on published sequences of the north american prototype vr- <dig> . viral rna was extracted using trizol reagent , dissolved in nuclease-free water, and stored at − <dig> °c until further use. both the reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction were conducted using the primescript one step rt-pcr kit  according the manufacturer’s directions. briefly, reverse transcription was performed at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min in the presence of a reaction mixture consisting of  <dig>  μl of the rna,  <dig>  μl of forward and reverse primers, 1μl primescript one step enzyme mix,  <dig> μl rnase-free h2o, and  <dig>  μl 2× one step buffer. the cycling conditions were  <dig> °c for  <dig> min, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation , annealing , and extension , followed by a final extension at  <dig> °c for  <dig> min.

genome cloning, sequencing, and analysis
the amplified pcr products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis then purified using the agarose gel dna purification kit . the pcr products were cloned into the pmd19-t vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions . multiple clones of each pcr product were sequenced, and the consensus of each fragment were assembled to determine the complete genome of yn- <dig> 

the complete genomic sequence was compared with other isolates by phylogenetic tree, which was generated by the distance based jotun hein method using lasergene v <dig>  software . the evolution of yn- <dig> was analyzed by comparison with other known isolates worldwide. multiple-sequence alignments were generated with megalign, and nucleotide sequence homologies were further assessed with lasergene.

measurement of ros and mda
intracellular ros levels were measured with 2′,7′-dichloro-fluorescein- diacetate  as previously described. dcfh-da passively diffuses into cells and is de-acetylated by esterases to form non-fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluores-cein . in the presence of ros, dcfh forms the fluorescent product dcf, which is trapped inside the cells. marc- <dig> cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 104/well in 96-plate  and cultured until the cells reached approximately 70- <dig> % confluence. cells were then infected with prrsv at a moi of 1and incubated for  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. to obtain dissociated marc- <dig> cells for the ros assay, culture medium was first removed and the cells were washed three times with pbs. dcfh-da, diluted to a final concentration of  <dig> μm with a serum free dmem, was added to cultures and incubated for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c. the fluorescence was measured at  <dig> nm for excitation and  <dig> nm for emission with a fluorescence plate reader . measurement of the lipid peroxidation marker mda was performed using a lipid peroxidation kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

western blot
standard methods were used to perform western blot. briefly, cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were diluted  in 2× sample buffer and boiled for  <dig> min. twenty micrograms of each extract was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . the membrane was washed with phosphate-buffered saline-tween  <dig> , blocked in a solution of tpbs containing  <dig> % nonfat dry milk , and then washed three times. the membrane was then incubated with primary antibody diluted 1: <dig> in blocking buffer overnight at  <dig> °c, washed three times with tpbs, and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase  diluted 1: <dig>  in blocking buffer for  <dig> h at rt. samples were washed three times with tpbs, and then the signal was detected with the chemiluminescent protein detection system according to the manufacturer’s directions . antibodies used for western blot include anti-nf-κb p <dig> , anti-rabbit igg-hrp , and anti-actin .

rna extaction and quantitative real-time rt-pcr
total cellular rna was extracted from prrsv-infected marc- <dig> cells using an rnaprep pure cell kit . rna  was reverse transcribed in a  <dig> μl reaction mixture. the cdna product was amplified in a  <dig> μl reaction mixture containing sybr green real-time pcr master mix . iκbα gene specific primers for real-time rt-pcr were 5′-tccacttggcggtgatca-3′ , 5′-atcacagccagcttccagaag-3′ . β-actin gene specific primers were 5′-tgagaacagctgcatccactt-3′ , 5′-cgaaggcagctcggagtt-3′ . each cdna sample was performed in triplicate. pcr amplifications were performed using a roche light cycler  <dig> real-time system . thermal cycling conditions were  <dig> min at  <dig> °c and  <dig> cycles of  <dig> s at  <dig> °c,  <dig> s at  <dig> °c and  <dig> s at  <dig> °c. in the present study, the data are presented as the change in target gene expression in stimulated marc- <dig> cells that are normalized to the internal control gene  and relative to the mock control expressed by the 2-∆∆ct method  <cit> . increased mrna expression was defined as a change of ≥  <dig> -fold, “normal” expression was a change ranging from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold, and decreased mrna expression was a change of ≤  <dig> -fold.

statistical analysis
the student’s t test was used for the statistical analyses. p values of less than  <dig>  were considered statistically significant.

in  <dig>  a highly pathogenic strain of type 2-prrsv , causing high fever and severe morbidity and mortality in pigs of all ages, emerged in swine farms all over china  <cit> . since after several years, the prrsv yn- <dig> was isolate from one of the yunnan province pig farm which pig presenting the similar clinical signs of hp-prrsv, such as rubefaction, blood spots, petechiae, erythematous blanching rashes, and pimples, frequently observed in ears, mouth, noses, back, and the inner thigh. other common symptoms included high fever , depression, anorexia, cough, asthma, lameness, shivering, disorder in the respiratory tract, and diarrhea. the pig farm never vaccination with prrsv before that.

approximately  <dig> h after exposure to lung or lymphonode homogenates, marc- <dig> cells presented with cytopathic effects . the presence of prrsv was confirmed by staining with the monoclonal antibody sdow- <dig> .fig.  <dig> negative control and prrsv isolate yn- <dig> infected marc- <dig> cells. a prrsv induced cytopathic effects  appeared approximately  <dig> h after infection. b indirect fluorescent antibody staining with fitc,  <dig> h after infection, confirmed the presence of prrsv. pictures were taken with a leica camera 



yn- <dig> was compared with the full length nucleotide sequences of other prrsv isolates  additional files  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  phylogenetic analysis showed that prrsv divided into two major genotypes, with the yn- <dig> isolate belonging to type  <dig>  within the type  <dig> branch, several minor branches were observed. the results indicate yn- <dig> most closely resembles vr- <dig> , with a nucleotide identity of  <dig>  %. compared with previous chinese isolates, yn- <dig> shared only  <dig>  % identity with hb 1/ <dig>   <dig>  % identity with bj- <dig>   <dig> % identity with ch-1a,  <dig>  % identity with hb-2/ <dig>  and  <dig>  % identity with the highly pathogenic strain jxwn <dig> respectively. furthermore, yn- <dig> did not possess the 30-aa deletion within nsp <dig> commonly associated with hp-prrsv  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of yn- <dig>  the tree was constructed using the complete genomic sequences of yn- <dig> and other prrsv sequences downloaded from genbank. multiple-sequence alignments were performed using the dnastar. the tree was constructed by the jotun hein method using lasergene. v  <dig>  software. the scale bar shows nucleotide substitution . the arrow indicates the location of yn-2011



prrsv infection of marc- <dig> cells induces ros and mda production
the growth kinetics of yn- <dig> in marc- <dig> cells was observed . to determine whether prrsv infection induced ros production, marc- <dig> cells were infected with prrsv at moi of  <dig>  and supernatants were collected at different time points. dcfh-da was added to cultures at each collection time point and incubated for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c. fluorescence was measured within  <dig> min. ros levels were similar for control and infected groups at  <dig> and  <dig> h time points . significantly higher levels of ros were detected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h time points in prrsv infected cells compared to controls, with ros levels peaking at  <dig> h post infection . as a positive control for dcf-da oxidation, marc- <dig> cells were exposed to  <dig> μm rosup  for  <dig> min. similar to prrsv infected cells, exposure to rosup resulted in a significant increase in mean fluorescent intensity compared to un-stimulated cells . these results demonstrate that the production of ros was increased following prrsv infection.fig.  <dig> growth kinetics of yn- <dig> in marc- <dig> cells. cytopathic effects  were observed on marc- <dig> cells after infection by viruses for  <dig> days. the cell supernatants were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hpi for virus titration in marc- <dig> cells

to confirm production of ros levels, mda concentrations were evaluated. similar to the results of ros production, there was a time-dependent increase in mda production in prrsv-infected marc- <dig> cells compared with control cells .fig.  <dig> mda production following prrsv infection. cell supernatants were collected at different time points after prrsv infection in marc- <dig> cells. mda levels were measured using a commercial kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 



nf- κb activation during prrsv infection
p <dig> protein expression, which is one of the key steps during activation of nf-κb, was detected by western blot following infection with prrsv. as shown in fig.  <dig>  infection with prrsv led to an increase in p <dig> protein in the nucleus, with significantly higher levels at  <dig> hpi compared to controls. in these  experiments, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining, and cultures were consistently found to be approximately  <dig> % viable in mock infected cells and  <dig> % in prrsv-infected cells at  <dig> hpi .fig.  <dig> expression of p <dig> protein following prrsv infection in marc- <dig> cells. marc- <dig> cells cultures were infected with prrsv at moi =  <dig>  cytoplasmic extracts were prepared at indicated time points and subjected to western blot analysis with antibodies specific for p <dig>  a key protein for nf-κb activation. β-actin was included as a control for sample loading. a the p <dig> protein expression was examined by western blot. b the band intensity was detected and the fold changes of nf-κb were calculated compared with control group. *p <  <dig> 



prrsv induced degradation of iκbα gene expression is dependent on infection time
activation of nf-κb is characterized by degradation of iκbα after phosphorylation by ikk in response to many types of extracellular stimuli  <cit> . this is followed by the phosphorylation of the nf-κb subunit p <dig> and nuclear translocation of nf-κb. to investigate the different time and potential mechanism of nf-κb activation by prrsv, iκbα gene expression levels were examined using quantitative real-time rt-pcr. as demonstrated in fig.  <dig>  iκba was detected in both prrsv infected and uninfected marc- <dig> cells at  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig> hpi. however, there was a significant decrease in iκba mrna levels at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hpi in prrsv infected marc- <dig> cells compared to uninfected controls. the lowest level of iκba mrna was detected at  <dig> hpi, which correlated with the highest level of nf-κb activity.fig.  <dig> iκbα mrna levels in marc- <dig> cells infected with prrsv. cultures were infected with prrsv at moi =  <dig>  cells were collected at the indicated time points, and the endogenous transcription of iκbα mrna was analyzed by real-time rt-pcr. the level of iκbα was first normalized to that of β-actin in the same sample and then compared with the control cells. *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> 



discussion
prrsv is characteristic of genetically extensive variation with the genetic/antigenic diverse strains in the field  <cit> . in the current study, we isolated and characterized yn- <dig>  which is the first prrsv isolate identified in the yunnan province of china. the complete genome was sequenced and submitted to the genbank . phylogenetic analysis indicated that the yn- <dig> was most similar to the type  <dig> isolate vr- <dig>  which shared  <dig>  % identity at the nucleotide level and clustered together in a subgroup compared to other type  <dig> and chinese isolates. interestingly, in contrast to the hp-prrsv strain previously reported in china, the yn- <dig> strain lacks the 30-aa deletion in nsp <dig>  however, yn- <dig> could also lead to severe clinical signs in the field and possesses several new nsp <dig> aa substitutions, such as 110-t/i, 284-s/f,  <dig> -ev/ql, 474-p/s, 490-t/a, 565-y/h, 567-d/n, 599-h/r, 683-r/h, 767-m/k, and 925-f/l  <cit> . the role of the new substitutions and virulence remains to be determined in the future. the results identify the viewpoint that the 30-amino-acid  deletion in nsp <dig> is not related to the virulence of the virus  <cit> . our study clearly indicates that the hp-prrsv variant, regardless of the 30-aa de-letion, continues to have a prevailing and accelerating evolution in china.

ros and free radicals have been demonstrated to function as cellular signaling molecules, influencing a variety of molecular and biochemical processes  <cit> . these include expression of proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and chemokines. however, excessive ros formation can lead to a condition of oxidative stress, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several acute and chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> . the induction of ros has been observed following stimulation with a variety of molecules and infection with certain viruses like hiv, hepatitis b, influenza, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated whether prrsv infection in marc- <dig> cells resulted in a condition of cellular oxidative stress, defined as a disruption of the pro-oxidant–antioxidant balance. results showing a progressive increase in ros  and the lipid peroxidation product, mda , provide strong evidence of increased oxidative stress in prrsv-infected marc- <dig> cells. however, increasing ros didn’t inhibit prrsv replication in marc- <dig> cells , which indicated that infection and replication of prrsv was independent with ros. previous reports have suggested that oxidative stress induced by increased generation of ros is involved in the activation of nf-κb  <cit> . virus infections such as porcine circovirus type  <dig>   <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus   <cit> , influenza virus  <cit> , hepatitis c virus   <cit> , japanese encephalitis virus  <cit> , and herpes simplex virus  <cit>  activate the nf-κb pathway through ros production. in this study, prrsv infection indeed resulted in the generation of ros firstly, and subsequent activation of nf-κb, which inducing the ros level peak appeared ahead of  <dig> h with nf-κb activation peak . the previously reported that the increased ros production by h2o <dig> initiated nf-κb activation  <cit> , but decreased the ros could cause reduce the nf-κb expression  <cit> .

viruses have developed various strategies which lead to either activation or inhibition of nf-κb-dependent gene transcription  <cit> . the nf-κb pathway can be activated as a protective response of the host to viruses. therefore, some viruses, such as vaccinia virus, african swine fever virus, influenza a virus, and mengovirus, have evolved strategies to block nf-κb activation in order to evade the innate immune response  <cit> . the nf-κb pathway can also be activated directly by viruses. for example, hiv, herpesviruses, hepatitis c virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, reovirus, dengue virus, west nile virus, and herpes simplex virus have evolved strategies to activate and exploit nf-κb for optimal replication, or to control host cell proliferation and survival to maximize viral progeny production  <cit> . viruses modulate nf-κb activation through various mechanisms. activation of nf-κb is usually mediated by degradation of iκbα in a proteasome-dependent mechanism after phosphorylation by ikk  <cit> . iκbα is generally thought to be the major inhibitor of nf-κb activation. nf-κb activation by influenza virus is mediated by oxidative radicals and activation of ikk as a result of over expression of viral proteins in endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . the tax transactivator oncoprotein of human t-lymphotropic virus- <dig> activates nf-κb by interacting directly with ikk  <cit> . hsv- <dig> induces persistent translocation of nf-κb by iκbα degradation  <cit> .

some viruses activate the nf-κb pathway through viral protein-cellular receptor interaction. in pprsv infection in vitro, the nonstructural protein  <dig>  and nucleocapsid protein  of prrsv played the crucial role in nf-κb activation  <cit> . previously, lee and kleiboeker showed that prrsv activated the nf-κb pathway through iκbα degradation at  <dig> hpi  <cit> . nf-κb activation changed through iκbα degradation in vitro  <cit> . in this study, similar results were observed, including activation of nf-κb at  <dig> hpi . in addition, a decrease in iκbα expression levels was observed at  <dig> hpi . combined with the results for ros and mda production , we suppose that ros generation either directly or through activation of cellular signal pathway leads to down regulation of ikbα and the subsequent activation of nf-κb. a previous study has shown that blocking ros by antioxidant n-acetyl-l-cysteine and tylvalosin abolished prrsv-induced nf-κb activation but didn’t significantly affect prrsv replication  <cit> . therefore, we postulate that at late stage, after the virus established its replication in host cells and maximized the viral progeny production, the virus would trigger the activation of nf-κb by ros for inducing host cell apoptosis, which results in the releasing of mature viral particles. future studies will confirm if prrsv activates the nf-κb pathway in pams and in vivo. understanding the role of nf-κb activation and its cascade signal pathway following prrsv infection will contribute important information about the molecular pathogenesis of prrsv infection.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this is the first time to report the prrsv yn- <dig> isolate from yunnan province, southwest of china. the ros generation involved nf-κb activation with time dependent in marc- <dig> cells infected with yn- <dig>  which should extend our better understanding the interaction between prrsv and host marc- <dig> cells.
