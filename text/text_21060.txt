BACKGROUND
cancer development involves a series of events, ranging from tumorigenesis to metastasis, each of which may be caused by perturbations in crucial signal transduction pathways. recently, drugs  specifically targeting critical components of signaling pathways known to be up-regulated in specific cancers have been used in the clinic. however, success of these inhibitors is limited by the intrinsic potential of cancer cells to acquire drug resistance. recent advances in both clinical and laboratory research have reported that cancer cells may adopt several mechanisms against particular treatments including adjusting the signaling circuitry, activation of alternative pathways and cross-talks among various pathways to overcome the effects of inhibitors  <cit> . resistance to a particular drug such as egfr  tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may occur not only due to cross-talks among egfr-mediated pathways, but also due to cross-talks with pathways triggered by other receptors. therefore, targeting signaling cross-talks may have the potential to sensitize cancer cells to particular inhibitors.

drug resistance is a major obstacle in drug efficacy that causes cancer cells to be insensitive to targeted inhibitor therapies and/or conventional chemotherapeutic agents  <cit> . however, there are two categories of resistance to inhibitor therapies: de novo and acquired  <cit> . by definition, de novo resistance is a phenotypic characteristic present before drug exposure where drugs with proven efficacy fail to cause tumor cells to respond with any significance  <cit> . acquired resistance refers to a situation where the initial sensitivity of tumor cells to drugs discontinues despite or due to continued consumption  <cit> . it has been reported that the underlying mechanisms of both types of resistance are related, often due to mutation, loss, or up-regulation of some other important signaling proteins or pathways  <cit> . de novo drug resistance can be determined by assessing the genetic profiles of tumors for 1) oncogenic addictions to proteins or pathways and 2) other possible genetic alterations conferring resistance  <cit> . therefore, targeting de novo resistance can enhance drug efficacy and reduce the chance of acquired resistance  <cit> . recently, characterizing drug-resistant tumors, and analyzing cell lines that result from the continuous culture of drug-sensitive cells in the presence of an inhibitor have been shown to be successful approaches for identifying changes responsible for acquired resistance  <cit> .

cross-talk among signaling pathways may play a vital role in cancer drug resistance, especially in receptor targeted therapies. for example, in egfr/her <dig> signaling pathways, cross-talk with other signaling pathways may occur at various levels of signal transduction: receptor level, mediator level and effector level  <cit> . at the receptor level, other rtks  having common downstream targets of egfr/her <dig> may become involved in cross-talk with egfr/her <dig> signaling pathways. in many cancers, these alternative rtks including met, igf1r, fgfr and epha <dig> become activated or amplified in order to maintain the signals for cell survival and/or proliferation in common downstream pathways, thus nullifying the inhibition of egfr kinase  <cit> . cross-talk at mediator level includes the activation/inactivation of major components of mediator pathways by mutation/deletion of oncogenic driver genes, which eventually activates downstream effectors  <cit> . these constitutive activations/inactivations of mediator pathways are independent of receptors. the effect of signaling cross-talk in drug resistance at effector level is more complex and diverse since there may be numerous effectors of rtks signaling pathways. resistance at the effector level may occur when some critical effectors  involved in cell survival and proliferation show an altered phenotype caused by other signaling pathways via rtk signaling cross-talk  <cit> . additionally, inhibitor sensitivity can be affected by cross-talk between signaling pathways triggered by the targeted rtk and other signaling pathways . for example, the egfr/her <dig> signaling pathway can cross-talk with wnt/ β-catenin, notch, and tnf α/ikk/nf- κb signaling pathways to affect the egfr/her <dig> inhibitors’ sensitivities  <cit> . cross-talk between effector pathways and feedback inhibition is also responsible for the adaptive and dynamic response of cancer cells against inhibitor therapies, for example, compensating the inhibited components to maintain key downstream functions, such as cell survival, proliferation etc.  <cit> .

lapatinib is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of egfr and erbb2/her <dig> receptors  <cit>  that is used in combination therapy of erbb2/her2-positive breast cancer patients with advanced or metastatic tumors  <cit> . several studies have examined the mechanism underlying lapatinib resistance at the molecular  <cit>  and system level  <cit> , active in her2-positive breast cancer cell-lines through signaling pathways. garrett et al.  <cit>  reported over-expression of her <dig> or her <dig> in lapatinib-resistant skbr <dig> and bt <dig> breast cancer cell lines. over-expression of axl tyrosine kinase was found in the bt <dig> cell-line  <cit> , but interestingly a switched addiction from her <dig> to fgfr <dig> pathway caused the uacc812/lr cell-line to become resistant to lapatinib  <cit> . moreover, a detailed analysis of the global cellular network by komurov et al.  <cit>  revealed that up-regulation of the glucose deprivation response pathway compensates for the lapatinib inhibition in skbr <dig> cell-line by providing an egfr/erbb2-independent mechanism of glucose uptake and survival  <cit> . thus, the activation or up-regulation of compensatory pathways confers poor sensitivity of inhibitors  in egfr or erbb <dig> targeted therapy  <cit> . the identification and analyses of potential cross-talks among the signaling pathways may provide deeper insights into the mechanism of drug resistance, and can facilitate finding a range of compensatory pathways for overcoming resistance in targeted therapy.

in this study, we collected the gene expression values of the erbb2-positive parental skbr <dig> cell-line and the lapatinib-resistant skbr3-r cell-line, derived from it, in the presence and absence of lapatinib  <cit> . then we used a fully bayesian statistical modeling approach to identify and analyze characteristic drug-resistant cross-talks between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways. ln that process, we considered two gene-gene networks originating from the gene expression matrices of both parental and resistant conditions, individually. to say a gene-pair involved in cross-talk between two particular signaling pathways has high potential of being involved in acquired drug-resistance, our research hypothesis was it should have high probability of appearing in the resistant network and low probability in the parental network. the rationale behind our hypothesis was that in breast cancer cell lines resistant to tamoxifen, a cross-talk mechanism has previously been identified between egfr and the igf1r signaling pathway  <cit> . the schematic diagram of our proposed framework is shown in figure  <dig>  like other biological processes, cancer signaling pathway activities and their corresponding network data possess stochasticity such that some gene-gene relationships  may not always be present or detected, whereas some other typical relationships may be absent. the stochastic nature of biological systems can be used to predict edge probabilities by formalizing them into a probabilistic model with other network properties  <cit> . hill et al. reported a data-driven approach that exploits a dynamic bayesian network  model to infer probabilistic relationships between node-pairs in a context-specific signaling network  <cit> . this study incorporates existing signaling biology using an informative prior distribution on the network, and its weight of contribution is measured with an empirical bayes analysis, maximum marginal likelihood. this study predicts a number of known and unexpected signaling links through time that are validated using independent targeted inhibition experiments  <cit> . here we have used a fully bayesian approach for inferring a probabilistic model: a special class of exponential random graph model, namely the p1-model. we used gibbs sampling for estimating model parameters with non-informative priors, in order to estimate the posterior probabilities of edges in gene-gene relationship networks. these identified cross-talks do not appear in the parental network but only in the resistant one, because the signaling network can be ‘rewired’ in a specific context  <cit> . this idea resembles the approach taken by hill et al. in that they inferred the probabilities of signaling links  varying through time. thus, these drug-resistance cross-talks can be informative to elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying drug-insensitivity and can help to develop novel therapeutics targeting signaling pathways.schematic diagram of our proposed framework.
 the framework for finding putative drug-resistant cross-talks. at first two gene expression data matrices were generated individually from the samples of both parental and resistant conditions. next, based on pair-wise correlations of genes’ expression values, two gene-gene relationship networks were derived. then, a bayesian statistical model called the p
1-model was applied on those two networks to find posterior probabilities of network edges. these posterior probabilities were used to find gene-pairs potentially contributing to drug resistance. next, these gene-pairs were analyzed for overlap with cross-talks between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways, and thus putative drug-resistant cross-talks were identified.  hierarchical bayesian model for inferring posterior probabilities of network parameters. here, α represents the propensity  of a gene to be connected in an undirected network, and is dependent on the hyperparameter Σ; θ is the global density parameter; λ

materials and method
dataset
a global gene expression  dataset  from 1) cells sensitive to lapatinib  and 2) cells with acquired resistance to lapatinib was obtained from komurov et al.  <cit> . expression values were measured using illumina humanht- <dig> v <dig>  expression beadchip . samples include skbr <dig> parental and resistant  each under basal conditions and in response to  <dig>  μm and  <dig> μm lapatinib after  <dig> hours, where the resistant cell line variant  showed 100-fold more resistance to lapatinib treatment than the parental skbr <dig> cell line, as reported by komurov et al.  <cit> . these gene expression datasets used probe-level annotation, which we converted into gene-level annotation. to obtain gene-level ge values, probes were mapped to gene symbols using the corresponding annotation file . while mapping, the average ge values were calculated across all probes if the same gene symbol was annotated to multiple probes. two ge data matrices were constructed for parental skbr <dig> cell lines and resistant skbr3-r cell lines, respectively, where rows were labelled with gene symbols and columns were labelled with different treatment conditions .

construction of a gene-gene relationship network
we define the gene-gene relationship network as ggr:=  for each ge data matrix. here, s is a set of  <dig> cancer related genes collected from the cancer gene census  <cit> . r is defined as the set of pair-wise relationships among seed genes. a gene pair  is included in r if the corresponding absolute pearson correlation coefficient  is above some threshold, and defined as a pair-wise relationship. these threshold values were empirically chosen for parental and resistant conditions individually, based on the corresponding distributions of all pairwise absolute pcc values. note pcc values resulting from probes mapped to the same gene were trivially ignored.

bayesian statistical modeling of ggr network
network model
for statistical modeling of networks, exponential families of distributions offer robust and flexible parametric models  <cit> . these probabilistic models can be used to evaluate the probability that an edge is present in the network. they can also be used to quantify topological properties of networks by summarizing them in a parametric form and associating sufficient statistics with those parameters  <cit> . in this study, we use a special class of exponential family distributions known as ergm , also known as the p1-model, which was introduced by holland and leinhardt  <cit> .

a gene-gene relationship network with g genes can be regarded as a random variable x taking values from a set g containing all 2g possible relationship networks  <cit> . let u be a generic point of g which can alternatively be denoted as the realization of x by x = u. let the binary outcome uij =  <dig> if genei interacts with genej, or uij =  <dig> otherwise. then u is a binary data matrix  <cit> . let pr be the probability function on g given by 
  pr=pr=1κθexp∑pθpzpu 

where zp is the network statistic of type p, θp is the parameter associated with zp and κ is the normalizing constant that ensures pr is a proper probability distribution   <cit> . the parameter θ is a vector of model parameters associated with network statistics and needs to be estimated. see  <cit>  for further details.

a major limitation of the p1-model is the difficulty of calculating the normalizing constant, κ, since it is a sum over the entire graph space. estimating the maximum likelihood of this model becomes intractable as there are 2g possible directed graphs  <dig> undirected graphs), each having g nodes . a technique called maximum pseudolikelihood estimation has been developed to address this problem  <cit> . this technique employs mcmc methods such as gibbs or metropolis-hastings sampling algorithms  <cit> .

the construction of the p1-model for a directed network is described in an appendix additional file 1: appendix i. for the gene-gene relationship network with undirected edges, the description of the p1-model can be simplified by using only two bernoulli variables yij <dig> and yij <dig> instead of four as follows: 
 yijk=1ifuij=k,0otherwise 

the simplified p1-model can then be defined using the following two equations to predict the probability of an edge being present between genei and genej: 
  logpryij1=1=λij+θ+αi+αj 

  logpryij0=1=λij 

for i<j. note that λij is chosen to ensure pr+pr= <dig>  in this formulation, the expansiveness and attractiveness parameters were reduced to a single parameter, α, which represents the propensity of a gene to be connected in an undirected network. hence, the p1-model seeks to find the probabilities of edge formation in a network considering its structural features explicitly.

bayesian modeling
we used a fully bayesian approach for modeling our gene-gene relationship network. parameter estimation is a crucial step in statistical modeling, for which a classical approach is maximum likelihood estimation . however, unlike mle, bayesian techniques involve calculation of posterior probabilities of model parameters by training the model with given data. we assume that the data  follows the generative model , and assign a prior probability pθ|ℳ to the parameter vector θ under the model . then bayes’ rule for calculating posterior probability is as follows: 
  prθ|ℳ,d=prd|θ,ℳ×prθ|ℳz 

where prd|θ,ℳ is the likelihood function. now, the marginal likelihood  can be expressed as 
  z=prd|ℳ=∫prd|ℳ,θ×pθ|ℳdθ, 

computing the exact solution for the marginal likelihood  is often intractable since it is prone to the curse of dimensionality. fortunately, markov chain monte carlo  methods such as gibbs sampling and metropolis-hastings methods do not require  to be explicitly computed. in general, mcmc methods are stochastic simulation techniques which generate samples from the joint distribution pℳ,θ|d for calculating the posterior probabilities of parameters. here we used gibbs sampling methods, which sample iteratively, one parameter at a time, from the full conditional distribution given the current and previous values of all other parameters. to implement gibbs sampling, we employed winbugs  <cit> , which is a high-level software package providing an easy interface for implementing complex bayesian models. in winbugs, users are free from background lower-level programming details, and only have to express the model precisely.

we hypothesized that gene-pairs involved in drug resistance are likely to be found with high probabilities in the resistant network but low probabilities in the parental network. therefore, we built two networks, one from resistant datasets and the other from parental datasets. in this bayesian approach, the model likelihood is defined in equations  and , where yk is the data matrix calculated from the observed data u. here we have two yk data matrices, namely a gene-gene relationship network ykr derived from resistant samples and ykp derived from parental samples.

our approach is a hierarchical bayesian model in that model parameters are in turn dependent on hyperparameters. we assign the density parameter θ in equation  a normal prior distribution with mean  <dig> and standard deviation σθ. 
  θ∼n <dig> σθ <dig> 

note, in winbugs the parameter τ, called the precision, replaces the standard deviation parameter σ of the normal distribution, where, τ=σ− <dig>  for the hyperparameter τθ we specify a gamma prior distribution as follows, since it is a conjugate prior for the normal distribution: 
  τθ∼gammaa <dig> b <dig> 

we set a <dig> =  <dig>  and b <dig> =  <dig>  to make the prior for θnoninformative, making its standard deviation wide to express large uncertainty  <cit> . for attractiveness/ expansiveness parameters αi and αj, we followed the approach used by adams et al.  <cit> . 
  αirαip∼n <dig> Σ 

  Σ−1∼wishart <dig>  

here, αir and αip represent the expansiveness/attractiveness parameters for the network model of resistant and parental conditions, respectively.

drug resistant cross-talk prediction
since, lapatinib is an egfr and erbb inhibitor, we considered the cross-talks between the egfr/erbb signaling pathway and other signaling pathways. here cross-talks can be defined as any gene-pair  in which genei ∈ {genes in egfr/erbb signaling pathway} and genej ∈ {genes in other signaling pathways}, or vice versa  <cit> . thus if both genes in any gene-pair were found in the same signaling pathway, that particular gene-pair was trivially ignored. for that purpose, we collected  <dig> signaling pathways from reactome  <cit>  ,  <dig> signaling pathways from kegg  <cit>  , and  <dig> signaling pathways from wikipathway  <cit>   databases. each signaling pathway downloaded from these databases was encoded as tab-delimitated lists of gene symbols.

to determine whether a given gene-pair is involved in drug resistance, we calculated a simple odds ratio of the corresponding two posterior probabilities: 
  odds=pryij1r=1pryij1p= <dig> 

where, yij1r and yij1p are gene-gene relationships defined over resistant and parental networks, respectively, and the probabilities are estimated using mcmc sampling. we then selected only those gene-pairs for which the odds score and pruijr= <dig> are greater than conservative thresholds, and identified these as the gene-pairs which are potentially involved in drug-resistance.

RESULTS
developing the network
for building gene-gene relationship networks, we considered the genes  from the cancer gene census  <cit>  only, since our aim was to find those gene-gene relationships which could be potential cross-talks among cancer signaling pathways. in order to identify such gene-pairs, we applied thresholds on their absolute pearson correlation coefficient  values. these thresholds were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for parental and resistant conditions, respectively, which we selected from the corresponding distributions of all-pair absolute pcc values with the purpose of considering approximately the top 20% gene-pairs as pairwise relationships only. applying these thresholds to the relationship values,  <dig>  and  <dig>  pair-wise relationships were identified in parental and resistant data matrices, respectively.

bayesian analysis
for the two gene-gene relationship networks ykr and ykp, bayesian inference of the parameters of the p1-model for an undirected network was applied. we used winbugs for scripting this inference and our scripts were inspired by adams et al.  <cit> . we used  <dig> mcmc iterations for parameter estimation with the first  <dig> as ‘burn-in’. all the parameters in the p1-model appeared to converge rapidly during the burn-in iterations . with the above settings, we estimated the posterior probabilities of each edge  pr in the two networks ykr and ykp. for each edge, the proportion of the  <dig> sampled networks containing the edge was considered as the posterior probability of that edge being present in the network.

next, for each edge we calculated the odds ratio of their posterior probabilities as defined above. the rationale behind this calculation was that the edges  found with high probabilities in resistant conditions but lower probabilities in parental conditions are more likely to be due to acquired resistance in cell lines. therefore, we chose only gene-pairs with high odds ratio  and high posterior probabilities  of occurring in resistant conditions. we found  <dig>  such gene-pairs  among all  <dig>   possibilities.

we then observed whether the above gene-pairs overlap with the list of potential cross-talks between egfr/erbb signaling and other signaling pathways. here, we collected  <dig> signaling pathways from reactome  <cit> ,  <dig> signaling pathways from kegg  <cit> , and  <dig> signaling pathways from wikipathway  <cit>  databases, and respectively identified  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   gene-pairs  between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways . of the  <dig>  gene-pairs identified above, we found  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gene-pairs overlap with the potential egfr cross-talks identified using reactome, kegg and wikipathway, respectively. note the number of potential cross-talks and the number of distinct gene-pairs are different because the same gene-pair can form cross-talks between multiple pathway-pairs . we consider these overlapping gene-pairs as putative drug-resistant cross-talks between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways. in these  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cross-talks, we found candidate egfr/erbb cross-talks with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> other signaling pathways, respectively. moreover, among all  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cross-talks from reactome, kegg and wikipathway, respectively, we found  <dig> distinct gene-pairs in at least two of these sets. primary findings and detailed descriptions of all these putative cross-talks from the analyses of all three pathway sources are listed in table  <dig>  and additional file 6: table s <dig>  additional file 7: table s <dig> and additional file 8: table s <dig>  respectively. the network views of all these cross-talk sets from the analyses of individual pathway sources are shown in figure  <dig> 

netwalker analyses
we conducted further analyses using netwalker, a network analysis suite for functional genomics  <cit> . in this analysis, we observed the changes in ge values for each gene in the identified list of potential cross-talks. this was to verify our expectation that, since lapatinib is an egfr/erbb inhibitor, both genes involved in drug-resistant cross-talks should be up-regulated in resistant conditions compared to parental conditions, which may imply that the activation of other compensatory signaling pathways in resistant conditions can play a role in acquired resistance to inhibitors by activating the targeted pathway  <cit> . therefore, for all  <dig> genes involved in the above sets of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> drug-resistant cross-talks from reactome, kegg and wikipathway, respectively, we made a heatmap image of ge values from both conditions  . for both resistant and parental conditions, we first averaged the gene expression values from the three samples corresponding to the three treatment conditions. then these averaged gene expression values were transformed into z-scores  and each z-score was normalized with the maximum of the absolute values of the z-scores across that particular gene. we observed that in  <dig> of these  <dig> genes , gene expression in one or more resistant conditions  was up-regulated relative to all the parental conditions   which may signify the insensitivity of these genes to inhibitors under resistant conditions. note for figure 3b only those genes are depicted for which both genes in some identified cross-talk had average ge values at resistant conditions greater than the average ge values at parental conditions.network view of   <dig>    <dig>  and   <dig> putative drug-resistant cross-talks between pathways using reactome, kegg, and wikipathway pathway databases in breast cancer cell-line: skbr <dig> . nodes are genes, and the edges are the cross-talks. note, all the cross-talks here possess posterior probabilities of appearing in resistant network ≥  <dig>  and odds ratio ≥  <dig> , which means the posterior probabilities of that cross-talk for appearing in parental network is ≤  <dig> .

signaling cross-talk between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways
cross-talk between egfr/erbb and notch signaling
we investigated literature evidence regarding the putative cross-talks between egfr/erbb signaling and other signaling pathways. we found akt2:maml <dig> , akt2:tp <dig> , akt2:myc , kit:maml <dig> , kit:tp <dig> , mdm2:maml <dig> , mdm2:tp <dig> , and tp53:maml <dig>  gene-pairs as putative cross-talks between egfr/erbb signaling and notch signaling pathways. up-regulation of the notch signaling pathway inhibits apoptosis and thus contributes to breast carcinogenesis  <cit> . the notch signaling pathway cross-talks with egfr/erbb signaling at the mediator level  <cit> , e.g. when activated, notch <dig> contributes to cell growth and survival via akt-activation in melanoma  <cit> . the notch <dig> co-activator complex binds to the hes <dig> promoter  <cit>  which encodes a transcription repressor that represses the expression of pten, a pi3k/akt pathway inhibitor  <cit>  contributing to tyrosine kinase inhibitor  resistance. furthermore, notch <dig> stimulates myc transcription  <cit>  and this stimulation can lead to the down-regulation of myc via the akt-pathway  <cit> . this putative gene-pair, akt2:myc was also found in our results as a potential drug-resistant cross-talk between the egfr/erbb and tgf- β receptor signaling pathways. again, in her2/neu-mediated resistance to dna-damaging agents, the akt pathway becomes activated which eventually suppresses p <dig> functions via enhancing mdm2-mediated ubiquitination  <cit> . protein-protein interaction between mdm <dig> and p <dig> is evident as contributing to various cancer related activities  <cit> .

cross-talk between egfr/erbb and wnt signaling
we found mdm2:apc , kit:cdc <dig> , mdm2:cdc <dig> , cbl:apc , pdgfra:apc , and cbl:cdc <dig> , akt2:apc , akt2:tp <dig> , and tp53:apc  as putative drug-resistant cross-talks between egfr/erbb and wnt signaling pathways. deregulation of the wnt/ β-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in various cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic and colon cancer  <cit> , and its association with drug-resistance has been studied by several research groups  <cit> . recently, it has been reported that resistant cell lines exhibited increased wnt signaling in both breast and colon cancer  <cit> . loh et al. showed that genes in the wnt signaling pathway, in both the β-catenin dependent  and the independent arms , were up-regulated in cell lines resistant to tamoxifen compared to the parental mcf <dig> cell line  <cit> . furthermore, ror <dig>  a constituent gene of wnt signaling pathway, plays a sustainer role in egfr-mediated prosurvival signaling in lung adenocarcinoma via signaling cross-talk and was therefore reported to be a potential therapeutic target  <cit> . apc and mdm <dig> in the mdm2:apc cross-talk are both tumor suppressors; they co-regulate dna polymerase- β  <cit>  which is reported to be hyper-activated in a cis-diamminedichloroplatinum resistant p <dig> murine leukemia cell line  <cit> . again, β-catenin whose stability is negatively regulated by apc  <cit> , confers resistance to pi3k/akt inhibitors in colon cancer  <cit> .

cross-talk between egfr/erbb and gpcr signaling

several studies have reported extensive cross-talk between ir /igf1r  and egfr/erbb signaling pathways contributing to acquired drug resistance in various cancers  <cit> . loduvini et al. reported significant correlation between worse disease-free survival and high co-expression of both egfr/erbb and igf1r in nsclc  patients  <cit> . egfr/erbb can physically interact with other non-erbb family receptors at the cell surface and can form heterodimers with receptors like igf1r, pdgfr etc.  <cit> . moreover, the egfr/erbb and igf1r pathways can also cross-talk indirectly via physical interactions between their downstream shared-components  <cit> . it has been reported recently that gefitinib  inhibits the phosphorylation of irs <dig> by ir, but also triggers the association between irs <dig> and igf1r which in turn induces drug-resistance  <cit> . knowlden et al. showed the cross-talk between igf1r and egfr signaling pathways occurred in tamoxifen-resistant mcf <dig> and t47d breast cancer cell-lines but not in non-resistant cells  <cit> . our findings suggest kit:stk <dig> , mdm2:stk <dig> , mdm2:akt <dig> , myc:akt <dig> , tp53:akt <dig> , mdm2:cbl , mdm2:socs <dig> , and tp53:socs <dig>  as putative drug-resistant cross-talks between the igf1r/ir and egfr/erbb signaling pathways. for the mdm <dig> and stk <dig>  genes, which we identified as a putative cross-talk between egfr and igf1r signaling, we did not find any direct supporting evidence in the literature. however, this association is plausible in the resistant conditions given that yamaguchi et al. suggested egfr signaling may cross-talk with the ampk/lkb signaling pathway  <cit> . moreover, levine et al. reported interconnections between p <dig> and igf1r/akt/mtor pathways where both lkb <dig> and mdm <dig> participate in a series of pathway cross-talks  <cit> .

validation of the framework using bt <dig> cell-line 
to further illustrate our method, we analysed a second dataset  containing gene expression profiles of breast cancer cell-line bt <dig> under two conditions   <cit> . the reason for choosing this dataset was that it was obtained using a similar experimental design to the primary dataset gse <dig>  but with an additional treatment condition using foretinib  only and with combined drug use . there were three samples per treatment condition. however, to adapt simply and be coherent with the previous experiment, we only considered expression values of parental conditions , and the same conditions with lapatinib resistant cells . among the  <dig> cancer genes from cancer gene census  <cit> , there were  <dig> genes which had gene expression values. we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  pair-wise gene-gene relationships  in resistant and parental networks by applying the thresholds  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. bayesian inference of the p1-model parameters for an undirected network was applied to these two gene-gene relationship networks as before. thereafter, among all  <dig>   possibilities, we found  <dig>  gene-pairs  with the same thresholds of odds ratio  as previously, but smaller posterior probability  of occurring in the resistant network. with this set of putative drug-resistant gene-pairs, we also observed the overlap of potential cross-talks of egfr/erbb with other signaling pathways using reactome, kegg and wikipathway databases. we found  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  cross-talks between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways from reactome, kegg and wikipathway , respectively. the numbers of signaling pathways that were involved in those egfr/erbb cross-talks were  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. among the  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cross-talks, we found  <dig> distinct gene-pairs in at least two of these sets. table  <dig> shows the comparative findings between our primary dataset  and our secondary dataset . in table  <dig>  we show that some important signaling pathways that were involved in the egfr/erbb cross-talks  in our primary dataset, have some overlap with our secondary dataset.comparative results between primary dataset  and validation dataset

¶these common cross-talks were found using the primary dataset  and validation datasets . cross-talks mentioned with bold face are those consistent with our hypothesis that both genes in the particular cross-talk are up-regulated in resistant conditions but down-regulated in parental conditions.

discussion
in this study, we developed a computational framework to systematically predict signaling cross-talks between egfr/erbb and other signaling pathways that contribute to lapatinib  resistance. we hypothesized that gene-pairs  that can potentially cause drug-resistance have a high probability of occurring in the resistant condition but a low probability in parental conditions. we employed a fully bayesian statistical model: a special class of exponential random graph model known as the p1-model, to infer the posterior probabilities of such gene-pairs from corresponding networks inferred using gene expression values  <cit>  of resistant and parental conditions. in selecting gene-pairs as putative cross-talks, threshold values for two parameters: odds and posterior probabilities of edges in resistant networks were empirically selected. however, more robust procedures for the selection of these two parameters can be made in future studies. all other parameters in the p1-model discussed above were estimated using gibbs sampling .

our results primarily focus on compensatory signaling pathways i.e. notch signaling, wnt signaling, gpcr signaling, and ir/igf1r signaling, which cross-talk with egfr/erbb signaling to reduce the inhibiting effect of lapatinib. we present additional literature evidence that the identified cross-talks of the above compensatory signaling pathways with egfr/erbb signaling may contribute to drug-resistance by maintaining key cell survival and/or proliferation signals in common down-stream pathways, including pi3k/akt signaling  <cit> .

komurov et al.  <cit>  hypothesized that cross-talks between egfr/erbb signaling and metabolic pathways contribute to resistance to lapatinib. more specifically, they identified that glucose deprivation reduces the inhibiting effects of lapatinib by up-regulating constituent genes and thus providing an egfr/erbb2-independent mechanism of glucose uptake and cell survival  <cit> . here, by using the same gene expression datasets, we found mdm2:stk <dig> cross-talk between egfr/erbb and igf1r signaling, where stk <dig>  phosphorylates and activates ampk in absence of glucose  <cit> . again, in the integrated signaling circuitry of pathways: p53-igf-1-akt-tsc2-mtor, a positive feedback loop  is formed which enhances p53-mediated apoptosis and senses nutrient deprivation  <cit> . thus our results complement the findings of komurov et al. by finding signaling cross-talks between egfr/erbb and igf1r pathways.

in netwalker analysis of our primary dataset , we compared the expression changes of all the samples in parental conditions  with those of all the samples in resistant conditions . however, we conducted another experiment on both of our primary  and secondary datasets  in which we first identified genes dysregulated in treatment vs basal conditions in parental samples and then checked if those genes were reversely changed in treatment conditions in resistant samples. to that end, for each sample, first we calculated the fold-change of parental treatment condition compared to parental basal condition, and then we calculated the fold-changes of resistant basal and resistant treatment conditions compared to parental basal condition . then, we chose only those genes for which, in any of the  <dig> samples, expressions were dysregulated  in  parental treatment condition , and for that particular sample, expressions were reversely changed  in all the resistant treatment conditions . this may be a strong indicator of sensitivity to an inhibitor in parental conditions and the development of acquired resistance. next, we compared these selected genes to cross-talks found in results from gse <dig>  and gse <dig> . although we didn’t find any such cross-talks overlapping with the results from the primary dataset , we found  <dig> from our secondary dataset  .

currently, our network modeling only considers undirected edges among genes. in future we would like to generalise the approach to identify directed and indirect interactions among genes. in network modeling, a combination of both direct and indirect relationships among gene-pairs was found to provide better insights into biological systems in our previous studies  <cit> . the rationale for combining these two types of gene-gene relationships in signaling networks is that egfr/erbb and igf1r can both cross-talk  directly at the receptor level, and indirectly mediated by gpcr signaling, as reported by van der veeken et al.  <cit> . other high-throughput datasets such as mirna expression data, copy number aberration data, and methylation data could also be incorporated into our framework to obtain a better understanding of gene dependencies. note that our methodology exploits a fully data-driven approach for finding putative drug-resistant cross-talks, without incorporating other prior information regarding gene-gene relationships, such as protein-protein interactions. hence, although our data-driven approach may inherently yield some false-positive predictions, it may also provide the possibilities of finding novel cross-talks contributing to drug- resistance.

CONCLUSIONS
our proposed computational framework is able to predict putative cross-talks among signaling pathways that play a role in drug resistance in two breast cancer cell-lines, skbr <dig> and bt <dig>  our framework could also be useful for other types of cancer to enhance understanding of the role of signaling cross-talks in drug resistance. most importantly, we believe our method can be used to find a range of compensatory pathways that nullify/reduce the inhibiting effects of drugs via cross-talk with targeted pathways. these novel compensatory pathways can be further considered as novel targets for single or combination therapies.
