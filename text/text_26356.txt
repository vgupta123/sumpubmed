BACKGROUND
rna polymerase iii  is the largest of the eukaryotic dna dependent rna polymerases and transcribes many of the genes involved in mrna processing  and protein translation , thereby regulating the growth rate of a cell  <cit> . rna pol iii activity has been demonstrated to be deregulated in a variety of cancers, irrespective of tissue type . like all eukaryotic rna polymerases, rna pol iii cannot recognize target promoter elements directly. proper initiation by rna pol iii requires the transcription factor tfiiib  <cit> . in higher eukaryotes, two forms of tfiiib have been identified thus far  <cit> . the form of tfiiib required for proper initiation from gene internal rna pol iii promoters is comprised of tbp, bdp <dig>  and brf <dig>  <cit> . proper initiation from gene external rna pol iii promoters requires tbp, bdp <dig>  and brf <dig>  <cit> .

tfiiib is a molecular target of regulation by a wide variety of tumor suppressors, including p <dig>  <cit> , arf  <cit> , pten  <cit> , rb  <cit> , and the rb-related pocket proteins  <cit> , as well as the oncogene c-myc  <cit>  and the mitogen-activated protein kinase erk  <cit> . rna pol iii and tfiiib activity have also been demonstrated to be negatively regulated by other proteins, such as maf <dig>  <cit> . maf <dig> is a common component of at least three signaling pathways leading to repression of rna pol iii transcription: the dna damage signaling pathway, the secretory defect signaling pathway, and the target of rapamycin  signaling pathway . more recently, rna pol iii transcription has also been demonstrated to be negatively regulated by the chemopreventative agent egcg  <cit> .

taken together, these data suggest that deregulation of tfiiib-mediated transcription may be an important step in tumor development. thus, we hypothesized that the observed specific elevation of rna pol iii transcription products in cancer  may be a result of alterations in expression of the rna pol iii initiation factor tfiiib. here, we report that the tfiiib subunits brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed in a variety of cancer cell lines. we further demonstrate that the brf <dig> and brf <dig> promoters differ in activity in cancer cell lines, and vai transcription is universally elevated, as compared to u <dig> snrna transcription, in breast, prostate and cancer cell lines.

RESULTS
the tfiiib subunits brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed in cancer cell lines
accurate initiation of transcription by rna pol iii requires tfiiib. two of the tfiiib subunits, brf <dig> and brf <dig>  are structurally related and are required for accurate transcription by rna pol iii  <cit> . brf <dig> is required for transcription from gene internal promoters , whereas brf <dig> is required for transcription from gene external rna pol iii promoters . hence, we sought to determine if brf <dig> and brf <dig> expression is elevated in a variety of cancer cell lines, contributing to the previously observed increase of rna pol iii transcripts in cancer. we obtained a variety of cervical, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer cell lines from the atcc, isolated total rna from asynchronous cells, and by rt-pcr determined the expression levels of brf <dig> and brf <dig> using gene specific primers . primers for β-actin  were used as a control, figure 1a. strikingly, the tfiiib subunits brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed in breast, cervical and prostate cancer cell lines . we then speculated that the observed differences in brf <dig> and brf <dig> expression is a consequence of alterations in mrna stability or may be a result of differential activity of the brf <dig> and brf <dig> promoters.

the brf <dig> and brf <dig> promoters differ in activity in breast, cervical and prostate cancer cell lines
to determine if the observed differences in brf <dig> and brf <dig> expression is a result of differences in transcription initiation, we set out to directly compare the activities of the brf <dig> and brf <dig> promoters. we have previously cloned the human brf <dig> promoter  <cit> , and using a similar strategy we cloned the human brf <dig> promoter. using gene2promoter software of the genomatix suite, we identified a putative promoter for brf <dig>  figure 2a. we subsequently amplified this putative promoter by pcr and sub-cloned it into a promoterless pgl3-basic vector, generating brf1-pgl <dig>  as expected, brf1-pgl <dig> was able to drive luciferase expression in a dna concentration-dependent manner in all three cell lines tested: hela, du <dig> and mcf- <dig> . these cell lines were selected since they all differentially expressed brf <dig> and brf <dig>  hela cells expressed higher levels of brf <dig> than brf <dig>  figure  <dig>  mcf- <dig> cells expressed higher levels of brf <dig>  as compared to brf <dig>  figure  <dig>  the du <dig> cell line expressed only slightly higher levels of brf <dig>  as compared to brf <dig> . strikingly, in all three cell lines tested, the brf <dig> promoter activity was significantly higher than the brf <dig> promoter, figure 2b–d, irrespective of brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna expression levels previously determined .

we cannot currently rule out the possibility that the observed lower brf <dig> promoter activity is a consequence of enhancer sequences missing in the brf1pgl <dig> construct used in these studies. however, analysis of the brf <dig> promoter reveals several cis-acting elements which may negatively regulate expression of brf <dig>  the brf <dig> promoter contains several binding sites for krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factors similar to sp <dig>  classified into structural subfamilies derived from variant sequences within their n-terminal domains and termed klf   <cit> . the brf <dig> promoter has three binding sites for the tumor suppressor zf <dig>  also known as klf <dig>  <cit> , which could negatively regulate expression from the brf <dig> promoter. also, the brf <dig> promoter contains multiple klf <dig> binding sites, previously identified as a ctbp-mediated repressor protein  <cit> . in addition, two zf <dig> cis-regulatory elements also are found within the brf <dig> promoter. zf <dig> is a ubiquitous kruppel-like zinc protein originally identified as a negative regulator of the c-myc promoter  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that negative regulation of the brf <dig> promoter may account for the consistently lower levels of brf <dig> promoter activity as compared to brf <dig> in all cell lines tested .

the brf <dig> promoter also contains binding sites for transcription factors which could positively regulate brf <dig> expression. for example, the brf <dig> promoter contains a myc/max binding site. sansom et al, demonstrated using a double mutant for myc that brf <dig> was no longer transcriptionally upregulated in the absence of functional myc  <cit> . however, it is unclear if regulation of brf <dig> expression by myc is a direct or indirect effect  <cit> . the brf <dig> promoter also contains several binding sites for nuclear respiratory factor  <dig>  which has been implicated in the upregulation of genes involved in fundamental cellular activities  <cit>  and mitochondrial respiratory function  <cit> . additionally, the brf <dig> promoter contains a binding site for zic <dig>  a transcriptional activator that plays a role in mammalian forebrain development  <cit> . the brf <dig> promoter also contains an immediate early growth response  binding site. egr <dig> is required for programmed cell death or apoptosis in both normal and tumor cells, but has also been determined to stimulate the differentiation of several cell types  <cit> . hence, positive and negative regulation of brf <dig> expression may be a key event in regulating the growth rate of a cell.

vai transcription is universally higher than u <dig> snrna transcription, in breast, prostate and cancer cell lines
the interesting observations that the brf <dig> promoter is more active than the brf <dig> promoter in all cell lines tested and that brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna are differentially expressed in cervical, breast and prostate cancer cell lines led us to speculate what effects these observations have on protein expression levels of brf <dig> and brf <dig>  thus, we determined the endogenous protein levels of brf <dig> and brf <dig> in hela, mcf- <dig> and du <dig> cells . the brf <dig> protein levels did not vary considerably in the breast, cervical and prostate lines tested . however, the brf <dig> protein expression levels differed significantly between the cervical, breast and prostate cancer cell lines tested, as compared to β-actin .

we then speculated what effect brf <dig> and brf <dig> protein concentrations had on vai and u <dig> snrna transcription levels in breast, prostate and cervical cancer cell lines. to address this issue we transiently transfected asynchronous hela, mcf- <dig>  and du <dig> cells with increasing concentrations of the u <dig> snrna  and the vai  promoters  <cit> . in all three cell lines tested, vai transcription levels were higher than u <dig> snrna, figure 3b–d. this result was surprising as we have previously observed that brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed  and the u <dig> specific tfiiib subunit brf <dig> promoter activity was significantly higher than brf <dig> promoter activity in all three cell lines tested . although the brf <dig> protein levels did not vary much in hela, mcf- <dig> and du- <dig> cells, vai transcription levels in these cancer cell lines varied considerably. vai transcription was approximately five fold higher in hela cells , as compared to du- <dig>  and mcf- <dig> cells . one possible reason that the observed vai transcription levels did not correlate well with brf <dig> protein levels is that cancer cells may already express brf <dig> levels far above limiting concentrations for rna pol iii transcription. interestingly, there is a correlation between brf <dig> protein levels  and the activity of the u <dig> promoter in hela , du- <dig>  and mcf- <dig>  cells.

we speculate the differences in brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna expression and promoter activities, as well as the observed differences in tfiiib-mediated rna pol iii transcription is a consequence of differences in brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna stability. differences in brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna stability may, in part, account for the differences in the endogenous protein levels of brf <dig> and brf <dig> observed in figure 3a, as compared to mrna expression levels in figure 1b–c.

modulation of mrna stability provides a rapid mechanism for regulating protein levels, independent of transcription initiation. a major mechanism controlling the rate of mrna turnover is the regulation of destabilizing cis-regulatory elements within a given transcript  <cit> . mrna destabilizing cis-regulatory elements have been localized as coding region determinant  sequences  <cit> , or as the more common au-rich elements  in the 3'utr  <cit>  of a transcript. these au-rich elements are heterogenous in terms of length, au-content and 3'utr location. however, ares may be classified based on sequence criteria  <cit> . class i ares contain multiple canonical auuua sites within the 3' utr and class ii contains multiple auuua sites which may overlap resulting in an auuuauuua sequence. the class iii ares have u-rich regions in the 3'utrs, without a canonical auuua site.

using the eldorado software of the genomatix suite we identified 3'utrs for brf <dig> and brf <dig> . the 3'utrs of brf <dig> and brf <dig> were au-rich, 25% and 52% respectively, but do not appear to contain classical class i or class ii au-rich elements. however, it remains to be experimentally determined if the significant au-content of the 3'utr of brf <dig> plays a role in regulating brf <dig> mrna turnover.

we cannot currently rule out the possibility that brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna stability is regulated by coding region determinant elements as previously described for c-fos  <cit> , c-myc  <cit> , and mnsod  <cit> . using align x , we aligned the coding sequences of brf <dig>  and brf <dig>  with a c-myc nucleotide sequence corresponding to a  <dig> amino acid region  previously defined as a coding region determinant  <cit>  . strikingly, within the coding regions for the c-terminus of brf <dig> and brf <dig>  there was a high degree of sequence identity with the coding determinant region of c-myc: brf <dig> was  <dig> % identical and brf <dig>  <dig> %. we will experimentally determine whether these regions indeed influence brf <dig> and brf <dig> mrna stability, ultimately providing an additional mechanism for regulation of basal rna pol iii transcription factors.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that the tfiiib subunits brf <dig> and brf <dig> are differentially expressed at the mrna level in a variety of cancer cells . we also show that the brf <dig> promoter is more active than the brf <dig> promoter in the breast, prostate and cervical cell lines tested . brf1-dependent vai transcription was significantly higher than the brf2-dependent u <dig> snrna transcription in hela, du- <dig> and mcf- <dig> cell lines . surprisingly, the brf <dig> protein levels did not vary considerably in hela, mcf- <dig> and du- <dig> cells , yet brf <dig> mrna expression varied considerably in the cancer cell lines tested . thus, brf <dig> promoter activity  and brf <dig> protein expression  levels did not correlate well with brf1-dependent transcription levels .

interestingly, we have observed that brf <dig> protein levels  may correlate with u <dig> snrna transcription rates in the breast, cervical and prostate cancer cell lines tested . hence, we speculate that since brf <dig> has been shown to be amplified in breast cancers and has been proposed to be a candidate oncogene  <cit> , strict regulation of brf <dig> expression could be critical in preventing the oncogenic phenotype. also, brf <dig> expression has been demonstrated to be induced in cervical cells infected with papilloma virus  <cit>  and cardiomyocytes undergoing hypertrophy  <cit> . in addition, brf <dig> has been shown to be a direct target of activation by c-myc and erk  <cit> , both known to play a key role in cancer pathogenesis. taken together, we reason that deregulation of brf <dig> and brf <dig> expression could be a key mechanism responsible for the observed deregulation of rna pol iii transcription in cancer cells.
