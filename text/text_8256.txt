BACKGROUND
burkholderia cenocepacia belongs to the b. cepacia complex , a group of gram-negative opportunistic pathogens infecting patients with cystic fibrosis  and chronic granulomatous disease  <cit> . these infections are detrimental in cf patients because the bacteria can spread between patients via social contact  <cit> , and in some cases patients develop an acute and fatal infection known as "cepacia syndrome"  <cit> . treatment of bcc infections is difficult because the bacteria are resistant to many antibiotics  <cit> , including antimicrobial peptides and polymyxins  <cit> , a group of compounds that have been proposed as potential new therapeutics for treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections in cf patients  <cit> .

we have recently proposed a two-tier model of antimicrobial peptide resistance in b. cenocepacia  <cit>  with the first and most significant tier consisting of the complete lipopolysaccharide  core oligosaccharide   <cit>  and the lipid a and core os aminoarabinose residues that are essential for the viability of b. cenocepacia  <cit> . this tier accounts for the low binding of polymyxin b to b. cenocepacia cells and poor permeabilization of the b. cenocepacia outer membrane  <cit> . the second tier consists of other mechanisms that each contribute a small amount of antimicrobial peptide resistance but that as whole contribute significantly to the high resistance of this organism  <cit> .

based on the observation that about 1% of polymyxin b-sensitive b. cenocepacia heptoseless lps mutant cells survive treatment with  <dig> μg/ml of the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b for  <dig> hours , we hypothesized that b. cenocepacia heptoseless lps isolates with increased resistance to polymyxin b could be obtained. we cultured a polymyxin b-sensitive b. cenocepacia heptoseless lps mutant, rsf <dig>  <cit> , in a way that allowed for the isolation of clones with increased resistance to polymyxin b to identify other mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide resistance in this highly resistant organism. rsf <dig> has a polymyxin b minimum inhibitory concentration- <dig>  of  <dig> μg/ml which is much lower than the full-length lps strain from which it was derived, k56- <dig>  which has a polymyxin b mic <dig> of >  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> . b. cenocepacia strains with heptoseless lps make an lps molecule that consists of lipid a and the innermost core oligosaccharide sugars: a trisaccharide of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid , d-glycero-d-talo-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid  and 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose . our isolation procedure led to the generation of heptoseless lps strains with an increasing range of polymyxin b resistance levels, some with at least 40-fold greater resistance than rsf <dig>  next, we determined how b. cenocepacia responds at the transcriptional level after treatment with polymyxin b, as a strategy for identifying additional mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide resistance in b. cenocepacia. we used three strains for this study: k56- <dig>  the parental clinical isolate that is highly resistant to polymyxin b  <cit> , rsf <dig>  and rsf <dig> 4000b, the isolate of rsf <dig> selected for the highest level of polymyxin b resistance. we established the baseline differences in transcription between the strains in the absence of polymyxin b challenge and identified genes transcriptionally regulated by the presence of polymyxin b in the three strains.

RESULTS
isolation and characterization of polymyxin b-resistant b. cenocepacia heptoseless lps clones
through sequential passage of the heptoseless lps mutant rsf <dig>  clones were isolated with increasing resistance to polymyxin b. strain rsf <dig> 25a was isolated from a single colony of rsf <dig> that grew on lb supplemented with  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b. strain rsf <dig> 200e was isolated from a colony of rsf <dig> 25a that grew on lb with  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b, strain rsf <dig> 1000d was isolated as a colony of rsf <dig> 200e that grew on lb containing l <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b, and strain rsf <dig> 4000b was isolated as a colony of rsf <dig> 1000d that grew on lb containing  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b . at each stage of the selection process, an isolate was chosen for the next stage of selection using the following criteria:  maintenance of the heptoseless lps phenotype,  a demonstrable increase in polymyxin b resistance using the polymyxin b plate challenge and also,  if possible, a demonstrable increase in polymyxin b resistance in the liquid polymyxin b challenge. the number in the nomenclature used for the isolates refers to the concentration of polymyxin b on which the isolate was obtained ; the letter distinguishes different isolates obtained on the same concentration of polymyxin b. to obtain highly polymyxin b-resistant rsf <dig> isolates required multiple rounds of selection. when rsf <dig> was plated directly on lb plates with  <dig> or  <dig> μg/ml of polymyxin b no colonies were obtained.

the increased resistance after each round of selection is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  all strains grew equally well on lb plates with a vehicle control . when plated on lb with  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b the growth of rsf <dig> was significantly impaired . the growth of both rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 25a was significantly impaired on lb with  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b . only k56- <dig>  rsf <dig> 1000d, and rsf <dig> 4000b grew on lb with  <dig> mg/ml polymyxin b, and rsf <dig> 4000b grew better than rsf <dig> 1000d. no differences were detected in the lps profiles of any of the resistant isolates  and all strains grew similarly under standard laboratory conditions . the lps phenotype could be complemented in trans with a plasmid  containing both the hlda and hldd genes , while a vector control  did not affect the lps phenotype of any of the resistant isolates . also, rsf <dig> carrying psl <dig> regained polymyxin b resistance to similar levels as the parental strain k56- <dig> , similarly to previously published results with the heptoseless lps mutant sal <dig>  <cit> . both hlda and hldd, which are co-transcribed, encode proteins required for the synthesis of heptose sugars that are incorporated into the lps core oligosaccharide  <cit>  and the transcription of both genes is defective in rsf <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, complementation of the lps phenotype in rsf <dig> and any strains derived from rsf <dig> requires that both hlda and hldd be provided in trans. lps from rsf <dig> 4000b was subjected to a more detailed chemical analysis to determine if there were subtle changes to the lps molecule that were not detectable on an lps gel; this lps did not differ substantially from the typical b. cenocepacia lipid a-inner core oligosaccharide  <cit>  . pcr analysis confirmed the presence of the original rsf <dig> deletion in the polymyxin b-resistant isolates .

next, we tested whether or not the changes are stable or lost in the absence of selective pressure. cells passaged for five days in the absence of polymyxin b grew as well on plates containing polymyxin b as cells grown only overnight in the absence of polymyxin b . from this we concluded that the changes that have occurred in our polymyxin b-resistant rsf <dig> isolates are likely constitutive.

binding of polymyxin b was assayed using the fluorescent analogue, dansyl-polymyxin b. when bound to lps on whole cells, dansyl-polymyxin b will fluoresce at  <dig> nm after excitation at  <dig> nm. as previously demonstrated  <cit> , we detected high binding of dansyl-polymyxin b to the positive control, p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig>  low binding to b. cenocepacia strain k56- <dig>  and a moderate increase in binding to b. cenocepacia strain rsf <dig> . this increase was similar to that found previously in b. cenocepacia mutants with heptoseless lps  <cit> . all of the polymyxin b-resistant rsf <dig> isolates bound dansyl-polymyxin b similarly to rsf <dig> , indicating that the levels of dansyl-polymyxin b binding in these mutants are due to the heptoseless lps and that increased polymyxin b resistance in these mutants is not due to decreased polymyxin b binding.

to measure cell envelope permeability, bacteria were treated with 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine . in a hydrophobic environment and excited at  <dig> nm, npn will emit at  <dig> nm. when treated with npn, rsf <dig> emitted at  <dig> nm at about twice the level as k56- <dig> . the polymyxin b-resistant rsf <dig> isolates had decreased permeability to npn compared to rsf <dig>  with the permeability of rsf <dig> strains 200e, 1000d, and 4000b roughly 30% less than rsf <dig> . none of the polymyxin b-resistant isolates had permeability reduced to the level of the wild-type lps strain k56- <dig> . the decreased permeability of the polymyxin b-resistant rsf <dig> strains, suggest lps-independent changes in the outer membrane of these mutants leading at least in part to increased polymyxin b resistance.

consistent with this conclusion, changes in colony morphology were also noted: k56- <dig> colonies are round with smooth margins , while those of rsf <dig> are irregularly shaped, have irregular margins and appear to have the dry and brittle morphology described as "crunchy" by parker et al  <cit> . the colony morphology of rsf <dig> 25a is similar to rsf <dig>  but rsf <dig> 200e, rsf <dig> 1000d, and rsf <dig> 4000b all form colonies that are more similar to those of k56- <dig> . although the causes of these changes are unknown, they are likely independent of the presence of heptoseless lps, which is common to all mutant strains.

together, these results indicate that the selection process provided a series of clonal isolates with:  increasing polymyxin b resistance,  a stable polymyxin b resistance phenotype,  no detectable changes in the original heptoseless lps structure of rsf <dig>   no significant changes to bacterial fitness,  no decreased polymyxin b binding to whole cells,  some decrease in membrane permeability, and  a return to the colony morphology of the parental k56- <dig> strain. the absence of changes in lps structure in the rsf <dig> 4000b mutant, suggests additional lps-independent mechanisms of resistance most likely targeting the bacterial outer membrane.

rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b have increased adherent growth in the presence of high concentrations of polymyxin b
similar polymyxin b resistance results were also obtained when the strains were challenged with polymyxin b in liquid culture . with each round of selection the resistant isolates grew better when challenged in liquid culture up to rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b which grew similarly in this assay . the growth of k56- <dig> at the highest concentrations of polymxyin b, both in liquid media and on solid media was still considerably better than any of the resistant rsf <dig> isolates . in liquid culture at high concentrations of polymyxin b , significant amounts of the rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b growth was either adherent to the sides of tubes or as small microcolonies suspended in the media. data in figure 3a represent the optical densities of the media after resuspension of this adherent growth. to quantify this observation, the experiments were repeated for k56- <dig>  rsf <dig>  rsf <dig> 1000d, and rsf <dig> 4000b in the presence of the vehicle control and either  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b  or  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b . after incubation the od <dig> was measured from the culture before vortexing tubes and after vortexing tubes. the od <dig> did not change significantly in k56- <dig> after vortexing regardless of treatment condition, for rsf <dig> the od <dig> increased by about 25% after vortexing, again regardless of treatment condition . this is consistent with the observation of increased cell-to-cell interactions in other gram-negative bacteria with truncated lps molecules  <cit> . for rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b grown in the presence of the vehicle control there were increases in od <dig> after vortexing similar to what is seen in rsf <dig> . however, in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b, the od <dig> values after vortexing were  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold greater than before vortexing for rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b, respectively .

increased resistance is neither specific to polymyxin b nor a general phenomenon
the polymyxin b-resistant isolates were tested for increased resistance to honey bee melittin, an antimicrobial peptide that is structurally unrelated to polymyxin b. there were modest increases in melittin resistance in rsf <dig> 200e, rsf <dig> 1000d, and rsf <dig> 4000b , but the growth of all of the heptoseless lps isolates was inhibited by at least 75% in  <dig> μg/ml melittin .

disk diffusion assays were used to test for increased resistance of the polymyxin b-resistant clones to non-peptide antimicrobial compounds and the results are shown in table  <dig>  no substantial increases in resistance to sds, novobiocin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol were seen in any of the polymyxin b-resistant isolates compared to the original heptoseless mutant rsf <dig>  polymyxin b-resistant isolates rsf <dig> 200e, rsf <dig> 1000d, and rsf <dig> 4000b were all more resistant to imipenem than rsf <dig> with the latter two strains exhibiting resistance to imipenem similar to the wild-type lps strain k56- <dig>  additionally, rsf <dig> 4000b demonstrated increased resistance to gentamicin compared to rsf <dig> and the other polymyxin b-resistant isolates. disks spotted with the vehicles in which these antimicrobial compounds were dissolved  did not impair the growth of any of the strains. together, these results indicate that the increased resistance to polymyxin b seen in these rsf <dig> isolates is not completely specific to polymyxin b since they demonstrate some increased resistance to a second antimicrobial peptide as well as some non-peptide antimicrobials, but that the increased resistance is not a general phenomenon since the polymyxin b-resistant isolates are as sensitive as rsf <dig> to many antimicrobial agents.

experimental approach for microarray analysis
to obtain a comprehensive view of the transcriptional response of b. cenocepacia to polymyxin b, and to gain greater insight into the changes that have occurred through our selection process, microarray analysis was conducted on the transcriptional response to treatment with sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin b in three strains . for each of the strains we compared transcription in the presence of polymyxin b to transcription in the presence of a vehicle control. additionally, to obtain baseline differences between the strains we also compared transcription in the presence of the vehicle control between k56- <dig> and rsf <dig>  and between rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b. concentrations of polymxyin b used in these studies were  <dig> μg/ml for rsf <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml for k56- <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b. these were the highest concentrations tested that did not inhibit growth of the strains under the conditions described in the methods .

establishment of baseline differences between k56- <dig>  rsf <dig>  and rsf <dig> 4000b
before analyzing the transcriptional responses in the presence of polymyxin b in the three strains used in this study, we first investigated the baseline differences in transcription between the strains under the conditions tested in this study. genes differentially regulated in the presence of the vehicle control between k56- <dig> and rsf <dig> are listed in sheet  <dig> of additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  while genes differentially regulated in the presence of the vehicle control between rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b are listed in sheet  <dig> of additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  genes differentially regulated between the strains were separated into functional classes based on their cog designations . some interesting patterns of expression were seen when comparing baseline levels of expression in the three strains. various genes were significantly overexpressed in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig>  and were also significantly downregulated in rsf <dig> 4000b compared to rsf <dig> . these include a cluster of genes spanning from bcam <dig> to bcam <dig> that are predicted to encode proteins with a variety of functions, a cluster of genes spanning from bcam <dig> to bcam <dig> and known to be involved in biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide cepacian  <cit> , and bcam <dig> which is a monocistronic gene that is predicted to encode a protein with redoxin activity. representative genes from these clusters, bcam <dig>  bcam <dig>  and bcam <dig>  were selected for transcriptional analysis by quantitative real time-pcr . the patterns of expression for these genes demonstrated by microarray analysis were confirmed by qrt-pcr .

adata shown are the mean from three independent experiments.

bdata shown are the mean of two or three independent experiments, which are also independent of those used for microarray analysis.

other genes significantly overexpressed in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig> that are not then altered between rsf <dig> 4000b and rsf <dig> include many genes predicted to encode exported proteins, lipoproteins, as well as proteins involved in cell envelope biogenesis, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, an efflux system, and a lectin . bcal <dig>  bcam <dig>  bcam <dig>  and bcam <dig> were chosen as representative up-regulated genes and this was confirmed by qrt-pcr .

there were few genes downregulated to a large extent in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig> . the gene bcal <dig> shown in additional file  <dig> table s <dig> to be down-regulated  <dig> -fold in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig> is hlda, the gene deleted in rsf <dig>  otherwise the only other gene down-regulated by 5-fold or more in rsf <dig> is bcal <dig> that encodes flagellin. this is consistent with the observation that rsf <dig> is less motile than k56- <dig> ; however, qrt-pcr found no differences in bcal <dig> expression between rsf <dig> and k56- <dig> . all other genes are downregulated by 4-fold or less and more than 50% of these genes were predicted prophage-related genes in the genomic island bcengi <dig>  which spans from bcam <dig> to bcam <dig>  <cit> . again, there is reciprocal regulation of the genes in bcengi <dig> and they are upregulated in rsf <dig> 4000b compared to rsf <dig> .

finally there were genes differentially expressed in rsf <dig> 4000b compared to rsf <dig> that were not significantly altered between rsf <dig> and k56- <dig> . these genes include two clusters  that are overexpressed by 10-fold or more and are predicted to encode proteins involved in energy production and lipid metabolism. genes down-regulated by 10-fold or more include one cluster  predicted to encode a phosphate abc transport system and bcal <dig>  which encodes a predicted exported alkaline phosphatase. qrt-pcr analysis of representative genes from these clusters  confirmed these patterns of expression . these genes are of interest because their changes in expression could contribute to the increased resistance of rsf <dig> 4000b to polymyxin b compared to rsf <dig>  with the baseline differences between k56- <dig>  rsf <dig>  and rsf <dig> 4000b established, we next sought to investigate the polymyxin b transcriptional responses made by each of these three strains.

cell motility associated genes are downregulated by b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> upon polymyxin b treatment
b. cenocepacia k56- <dig> was grown to mid-log phase, treated with  <dig> μg/ml of polymyxin b or a vehicle control, rna was extracted, converted to cdna, and subjected to microarray analysis. for a complete list of genes differentially regulated in the presence of polymyxin b compared to the vehicle control in k56- <dig> see sheet  <dig> of additional file  <dig> table s <dig>  the differentially regulated genes were organized according to their clusters of orthologous groups  designations   <cit> . the largest group of differentially regulated genes was those associated with cell motility. almost all genes encoding proteins required for building and operating flagella are divided into five clusters located on the largest chromosome of b. cenocepacia   <cit> . genes from all five of these clusters were downregulated upon treatment with polymxyin b . furthermore, the only genes differentially downregulated by 10-fold or more in the presence of polymyxin b were genes in these clusters. downregulation was confirmed by qrt-pcr  for one gene from each of the five clusters . based on these results we concluded that under the conditions we tested, one of the major transcriptional responses of b. cenocepacia to polymyxin b was a downregulation of cell motility genes, particularly those required for flagella. two assays were conducted to test for a role for flagella in polymyxin b resistance. first, mic <dig> values were determined for b. cenocepacia strain k56- <dig> and an isogenic, non-flagellated mutant, rsf <dig>  <cit> . both strains had mic <dig> values greater than  <dig> μg/ml for polymyxin b, which was the highest concentration tested. second, bacteria were grown overnight in liquid culture and then serial dilutions were plated on solid agar plates containing either  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b or a vehicle control. both strains grew equally well under either of the conditions . together, these experiments suggested that a mutant that lacks flagella maintains polymyxin b resistance at least at the concentrations tested and that the concentrations of polymyxin b tested in the following assays do not significantly inhibit the growth of either of the strains.

swimming and swarming motility are impaired by polymyxin b
of the five types of bacterial motility that have been described   <cit> , two, swimming and swarming, are dependent on flagella  <cit>  and have been demonstrated to occur in b. cenocepacia  <cit> . we tested the effect of polymyxin b on the ability of b. cenocepacia to move by both of these mechanisms. the parental strain k56- <dig> and a flagella-negative mutant, rsf <dig>  were inoculated into semi-solid agar plates containing either a vehicle control or  <dig> μg/ml of polymyxin b throughout the media to test for swimming motility. growth of k56- <dig> in plates with the vehicle control radiated outwards from the point of inoculation to a much greater extent than it did in plates containing  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b , while rsf <dig> grew as a single colony at the point of inoculation regardless of treatment condition . quantitation of this phenotype  showed that on average the zone of growth of k56- <dig> in swimming motility plates with the vehicle control was more than twice the size of the growth in plates with polymyxin b.

assays were also conducted to determine if swarming motility is impaired by polymyxin b. k56- <dig> was able to swarm across plates containing the vehicle control . the flagella-negative mutant rsf <dig> also grew across the surface of the plates with the vehicle control, although to a much less extent than k56- <dig> . motility of both of these strains was highly impaired in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml polymyxin b . swarming motility results in the absence of polymyxin b for rsf <dig> are similar to those reported for a pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant lacking both flagella and the type iv pili, which began to undergo sliding motility when grown under conditions required for swarming motility  <cit> . the authors of this study also found that sliding and swarming motility resulted from similar environmental cues, which could explain why both k56- <dig> and rsf <dig> appear non-motile in the presence of polymyxin b. these types of analyses were not completed for rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b because both strains have motility similar to rsf <dig> in the absence of polymyxin b .

polymyxin b treatment upregulates genes with diverse functions
treatment of k56- <dig> with polymyxin b led to the upregulation of thirty genes , predicted to encode proteins involved in a variety of pathways, particularly lipid transport and metabolism and cell envelope biogenesis . genes that were amongst the most highly overexpressed include: a cluster spanning bcam <dig> to bcam <dig> that contains genes encoding proteins with predicted sugar modifying and transferase activities, bcam <dig>  encoding a predicted nad dependent epimerase/dehydratase, and bcam <dig> to bcam <dig>  encoding a predicted macrolide efflux system. qrt-pcr conducted for bcam <dig> and bcam <dig> demonstrated that both genes were overexpressed . qrt-pcr experiments were also attempted for bcam <dig>  however, these experiments failed, as we could not obtain a primer pair that efficiently amplified the transcript or the gene from genomic dna . the genes upregulated upon treatment with polymyxin b are of interest as they may represent novel genes involved in the resistance of b. cenocepacia to polymyxin b.

regulation by polymyxin b in rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b
since we have previously identified genes involved in polymyxin b resistance in rsf <dig>  <cit> , we thought that it might be possible to identify additional polymyxin b-responsive genes in this strain that were not identified in k56- <dig>  in total,  <dig> genes were upregulated in rsf <dig> upon polymyxin b treatment  and of the  <dig> genes upregulated by k56- <dig> in the presence of polymyxin b, more than a third appeared in the rsf <dig> data set as well. of the remaining  <dig> genes upregulated in rsf <dig> in the presence of polymyxin b only two are upregulated by five-fold or more. the only cluster that stood out in this data set was a group of genes, bcal <dig> to bcal <dig>  predicted to encode a two-component regulatory system and an outer membrane protein, transcribed in opposite orientations. this cluster is also upregulated in k56- <dig> in the presence of polymyxin b but not to the same extent . qrt-pcr experiments for bcal <dig> using rna extracted from k56- <dig> grown in the presence or absence of polymyxin b indicated that this cluster of genes is upregulated in the presence of polymyxin b . almost all genes downregulated by rsf <dig> in the presence of polymyxin b are involved in the assembly or function of the flagellum .

the picture is quite different in rsf <dig> 4000b;  <dig> genes were found to be upregulated in the presence of polymyxin b, all of which were upregulated by less than five-fold . this list of genes did not include some of the largest changes described above, including the cluster spanning bcam <dig> to bcam <dig>  or the fold-changes were less than those seen in k56- <dig> and/or rsf <dig>  only  <dig> genes were downregulated by rsf <dig> 4000b in the presence of polymyxin b, a third of which were trna-encoding genes, and none of which were flagellar-related genes .

discussion
two genomic approaches were utilized to study polymyxin b resistance in b. cenocepacia. a lineage of increasingly polymyxin b-resistant heptoseless lps mutants was obtained through selection of resistant isolates on media that prohibited the replication of the vast majority of the cells plated. at each round of selection approximately one polymyxin b-resistant isolate per  <dig> cfu plated was obtained. initial characterization of these isolates shows that they exhibited:  increased polymyxin b resistance that is relatively stable, since it is maintained after the cells are grown in the absence of polymyxin b for five days;  no defects in growth rate, suggesting that the mutation or mutations do not affect the general fitness of the bacteria, and  increased polymyxin b resistance in liquid media despite the fact that selection of the isolates occurred on solid media. these isolates show significant increases in resistance to imipenem and melittin, and in the case of the final isolate , to gentamicin.

although it must be noted that the pleiotropic changes seen in the polymyxin b-resistant isolates may not all contribute to the polymxyin b resistance of the isolates, many of the phenotypic changes seen in the isolates could be associated with increased antimicrobial peptide resistance. subpopulations of p. aeruginosa and e. coli within biofilms  <cit>  have been shown to develop increased antimicrobial peptide resistance and the results presented here suggest that high concentrations of polymyxin b induce increased adherent growth of rsf <dig> 1000d and rsf <dig> 4000b, possibly resulting in protection of bacterial cells within the adherent growth from polymyxin b. the heptoseless lps phenotype induces outer membrane instability that has pleiotropic effects on bacteria  <cit>  including changes in colony morphology changes  <cit> . the return to the wild-type colony morphology in rsf <dig> 200e and later isolates could indicate that the polymyxin b-resistant isolates may have altered outer membrane properties that in some way stabilize the outer membrane. this interpretation is consistent with our observation of decreased npn access to the outer membrane in the polymyxin b-resistant isolates. experiments are currently underway to precisely determine the genes and/or proteins whose expression and/or function have been altered through the selection process to increase the polymyxin b resistance of rsf <dig> 

microarray analysis conducted to compare baseline changes in the gene expression between k56- <dig>  rsf <dig> and rsf <dig> 4000b show that there are many genes whose expression are substantially upregulated in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig> . the types of genes differentially expressed in rsf <dig> compared to k56- <dig> are consistent with observations in the literature that heptoseless lps mutants tend to alter the synthesis of other polysaccharides  <cit> , the data are also similar to a microarray study of a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium heptoseless lps mutant which showed changes in sugar metabolism and expression of genes predicted to encode outer membrane proteins and lipoproteins, as well as decreased expression of genes required for the flagellum  <cit> . these types of changes are likely the consequence of the pleiotropic effects seen in heptoseless lps mutants  <cit> . interestingly, rsf <dig> 4000b reverses some but not all of these changes . this is similar to some of the phenotypic changes seen in this strain such as return to wild-type colony morphology  and intermediate permeability to npn . since some of the genes overexpressed in rsf <dig> are downregulated in rsf <dig> 4000b, this isolate could have an altered cell envelope that decreases these pleiotropic effects, and also makes it less susceptible to polymyxin b challenge. there are also genes  whose expression is significantly altered in rsf <dig> 4000b compared to rsf <dig> but are not altered between k56- <dig> and rsf <dig>  these changes in gene expression may contribute to the increased polymyxin b resistance in rsf <dig> 4000b, which we are currently studying using mutagenesis strategies.

downregulation of motility-associated gene expression is a major transcriptional response in b. cenocepacia upon treatment with polymyxin b under the conditions tested in this study which results in impairment of swimming and swarming motility in the presence of polymyxin b. none of the genes that have previously been implicated in the resistance of b. cenocepacia to antimicrobial peptides  <cit>  were differentially regulated by polymyxin b under the conditions tested. it is possible that other conditions  are required to see differential regulation of these genes. it is also just as possible that expression of these antimicrobial peptide resistance genes are not regulated by the presence of antimicrobial peptides in the environment and that major resistance mechanisms are constitutively active in b. cenocepacia, which could help to explain in part the high resistance of b. cenocepacia to these compounds. there are various genes upregulated by both k56- <dig> and rsf <dig> grown in the presence of polymyxin b, including genes encoding proteins involved in lipid transport and metabolism, cell envelope biogenesis, signal transduction, and transcription, as well as genes of unknown function. characterization of potential roles in polymyxin b resistance for these genes is currently underway.

at least two microarray studies have been published on p. aeruginosa and its response to antimicrobial peptides that have identified differential regulation of genes associated with motility. cummins et al showed that exposure of planktonic cells to subinhibitory concentrations of colistin  lead to small decreases in expression of genes associated with motility  <cit> . the authors of this study also found that the response of p. aeruginosa to colistin included upregulation of both known colistin resistance genes as well as genes that had not previously been shown to be involved in resistance . meanwhile, overhage et al showed that exposure of p. aeruginosa grown as biofilms in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ll- <dig> led to increased expression of type iv pili genes and decreased expression of flagella genes  <cit> . phenotypically, the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of ll- <dig> led to increased twitching motility , but had no effect on swarming or swimming motility.

swarming motility is a multicellular bacterial lifestyle  <cit>  and there are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether or not this protects bacteria from antimicrobial peptides. lai and colleagues  <cit>  showed that swarming cells of escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa, and bacillus subtilis were more resistant than planktonic cells to numerous antibiotics, except for the antimicrobial peptides polymyxin b and colistin; while kim et al  <cit>  showed that swarming salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium cells were more resistant than planktonic cells to polymxyin b and colistin. our data indicates that a subinhibitory concentration of polymyxin b greatly impairs the ability of b. cenocepacia to both swim and swarm.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain heptoseless lps strains of b. cenocepacia with high resistance to polymyxin b, and suggest that this may occur through lps-independent changes that stabilize the outer membrane in some way. furthermore, our data demonstrate that major transcriptional changes made by b. cenocepacia upon treatment with polymxyin b include downregulation of genes required for the synthesis and operation of the flagella and upregulation of a set of genes encoding proteins with diverse predicted functions. the contribution made by genes that are upregulated by b. cenocepacia upon treatment with polymyxin b to polymyxin b resistance must now be determined and is underway in the valvano laboratory. decreased flagellar gene expression upon treatment with polymyxin b impairs both swimming and swarming motility, two processes that require the flagella. b. cenocepacia mutants lacking flagella have been shown to be less virulent in mice  <cit>  and less able to invade a <dig> human respiratory epithelial cells  <cit> . additionally, upregulation of flagellar genes has been reported in b. cenocepacia when it is grown in cf sputum  <cit> . therefore, even if a therapeutically available antimicrobial peptide was incapable of killing b. cenocepacia it might still be useful for treating b. cenocepacia infections because the inhibition of motility may be detrimental to the pathogenicity of b. cenocepacia.
