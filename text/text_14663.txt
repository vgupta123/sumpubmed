BACKGROUND
arthropod-borne viruses  such as sindbis and chikungunya viruses are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. the viruses exhibit significant morbidity and mortality in the vertebrate host. however, virus persists in the mosquito vector with minimal associated pathology. examples of arbovirus-induced cytopathology during infection have been described with laboratory-infected mosquitoes, but little is known about the interplay between virus and vector that allows for sustainable arbovirus infection in the environment  <cit> . the persistent nature of arbovirus infection of a vector suggests a commensal rather than parasitic relationship. a factor of particular interest in this relationship is the interaction of viral replication and the mosquito rna interference  response to infection.

rnai is a highly conserved molecular pathway triggered by the presence of intracytoplasmic double-stranded rna  that results in the cleavage of rna molecules with sequence homologous to the dsrna. in insects, rnai is a major antiviral pathway that modulates arbovirus infection. keene et al  and campbell et al  used dsrna injection to show that transient knockdown of key rnai components increases viral loads in individual mosquitoes. titers of o'nyong-nyong virus  in anopheles gambiae and sindbis virus in aedes aegypti were higher if argonaute- <dig> or dicer- <dig> expression was silenced  <cit> . these studies show that rnai restricts replication of an arbovirus in the mosquito.

during replication of the alphavirus genome, positive- and negative-sense rnas form dsrna intermediates that could be recognized and cleaved by dicer- <dig>  alternatively, secondary structure of the positive-sense rna genome may be targeted by the rnai machinery, as was shown in plants infected with positive-sense, ssrna viruses  <cit> . sinv-specific sirnas of both polarities have been detected in infected mosquitoes with increased sense sirnas being observed  <cit> , suggesting secondary structure is the primary, but not only, molecular rnai trigger. thus sinv replication appears to be targeted by the rnai response in mosquitoes. to date there have been no reports of sinv-encoded proteins that interfere with the rnai response, although certain strains of sinv appear to be more or less refractory to rnai in mosquito cells  <cit> . however, other insect viruses are known to contain rnai suppressors that aid in their replication via suppression of the rnai response. the b <dig> protein from the insect-pathogenic fhv is a potent viral suppressor of rna silencing  that binds to dsrna as a dimer in a sequence-independent manner and can bind a range of dsrna sizes  <cit> . the generic and promiscuous nature of dsrna binding by b <dig>  evidenced by its ability to inhibit rnai in plants, nematodes, and insects, makes it an excellent candidate to study the effects of rnai suppression in mosquitoes  <cit> .

this report describes the production of a recombinant sinv that expresses a heterologous vsr protein and use of the virus to directly study the effects of rnai on mosquito infection. a te/3'2j virus was engineered to express the b <dig> protein, with the hypothesis that expression of b <dig> during sinv infection would inhibit the rnai response in infected mosquito cells and that this inhibition will lead to increased virus replication within the mosquito. the vsr was functional in mosquito cells and affected the replication of te/3'2j virus in ae. aegypti cell culture. mosquito infection experiments show that not only are rates of infection and dissemination of sinv in ae. aegypti increased if rnai is inhibited, but that the b2-expressing virus became highly pathogenic in the mosquito, significantly shortening the mosquitoes' lifespan. these studies highlight the necessity for rnai from both the standpoint of mosquito survival and arbovirus persistence.

RESULTS
inhibition of rnai by a sinv-expressed vsr
after rescue of infectious virus from cdna-derived rna, expression of v <dig> epitope-tagged b <dig> protein from the second subgenomic promoter was verified by immunoblot analysis of total protein from infected aag <dig> cells. using a commercial antibody against the v <dig> epitope, we observed a single band of approximately  <dig> kilodaltons  in b2-infected cells , in agreement with the predicted size of v5-tagged b <dig> protein . no bands were detected in cells infected with te/3'2j, te/3'2j/gfp, or mock-infected cells.

to determine the ability of sinv-expressed b <dig> protein to inhibit the mosquito rnai response, an in vitro dicing assay was performed. a synthetic  <dig> bp biotinylated dsrna derived from the bacterial β-galactosidase gene was introduced into aag <dig> cell lysates produced from cells mock-infected or infected with gfp- or b2-expressing virus. the presence of sirna product suggested that dsrna processing to sirnas occurs in aag <dig> cells. biotinylated rna approximately 21– <dig> nucleotides in length accumulated in mock- and te/3'2j/gfp virus-infected cell lysates, whereas little biotinylated rna was detected in the expected size range at any time points tested in te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected cell lysates .

after determining that b <dig> protein could inhibit the accumulation of sirnas derived from a synthetic dsrna in cell culture-derived lysates, we investigated the ability of the protein to inhibit virus-specific sirna accumulation during virus replication in mosquito cells. the accumulation of sinv e <dig> gene-derived antisense small rnas was examined in infected aag <dig> cells over a 72-hour time course. beginning at  <dig> hours and continuing to  <dig> hours post-infection, sinv-specific rnas 21– <dig> nucleotides in size were detected in aag <dig> cells infected with te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp viruses. the size of the small rnas is consistent with previous reports of virus-derived sirnas detected in mosquito cells  <cit> . few rnas of this size were detected at any time in mock-infected cells or cells infected with te/3'2j/b <dig>  suggesting that b <dig> protein can function to inhibit virus-specific rnai in mosquito cell culture .

the same methodologies were used to detect virus-derived sirnas in intrathoracically-injected ae. aegypti mosquitoes. similar to cell culture, small rnas 21– <dig> nucleotides in size were detected in te/3'2j- and te/3'2j/gfp-infected mosquitoes at  <dig> hours post-infection . sirnas accumulated to large amounts by  <dig> hours in mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j, and to a lesser extent in te/3'2j/gfp-injected mosquitoes. no virus-specific sirnas could be detected in mosquitoes mock-injected with cell culture medium or injected with te/3'2j/b <dig>  indicating that b <dig> protein could inhibit targeted degradation of the sinv genome in the context of infected mosquitoes .

effects of b <dig> protein expression on sinv replication
the inhibition of sirna accumulation showed that b <dig> protein could inhibit rnai in mosquito cells. to determine the effects that rnai inhibition may have on sinv replication, we first examined the ability of sinv rna to accumulate in infected cells. using the same total rna samples used for sirna detection, we examined the accumulation of viral genomic and subgenomic rna species in aag <dig> cells and mosquitoes by northern blot analysis . starting at  <dig> hours post-infection, three viral rna species were detected in cells infected with te/3'2j, te/3'2j/gfp, and te/3'2j/b <dig> viruses. these bands represent the genomic, first subgenomic, and second subgenomic rnas produced during virus infection. the second subgenomic rna, expressed from the most 3' virus promoter, is the most highly transcribed rna species for all three viruses, consistent with previous reports  <cit> . the observed inhibition of sirna accumulation in te/3'2j/b2-infected cells corresponded with a distinct increase in viral rna accumulation. considerably more viral rna was detected in cells and mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus beginning at  <dig> hours post-infection and continuing throughout all time points tested. much less viral rna accumulated in te/3'2j/gfp-infected cells and mosquitoes, an expected outcome considering the increase in genome size and accompanying decrease in replication efficiency  <cit> . no bands were observed in rna from mock-infected cells.

because sirna accumulation was inhibited and viral rna amounts increased in te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected cells, we tested if suppression of rnai by b <dig> would cause more infectious virus to be produced during infection. we performed two-step growth curve analysis in aag <dig> and vero cells to determine the effects of b <dig> protein expression on infectious virus production . virus titers were determined from supernatant of cells infected with te/3'2j, te/3'2j/gfp, and te/3'2j/b <dig> viruses at a multiplicity of infection  =  <dig> . te/3'2j/b <dig> replicated to a maximum titer of  <dig>  log <dig> pfu/ml at  <dig> hours post-infection in aag <dig> . this was more than 10-fold higher than te/3'2j  and 100-fold higher than te/3'2j/gfp . te/3'2j/gfp replicated less efficiently than te/3'2j, suggesting that virus encoding an insert may be less able to replicate in aag <dig> cells. a marked decrease in titer was observed at later time points during te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection of aag <dig>  coinciding with the presence of cytopathic effects not observed in te/3'2j- or te/3'2j/gfp-infected cells . notwithstanding, the titer of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus was greater than the titers of te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp at all time points tested in this cell line.

growth curve analysis was also performed in vero cells to determine the effects of b <dig> protein expression on sinv replication in vertebrate cells . surprisingly, replication of all three viruses was similar in this cell line. peak titers of  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  log <dig> pfu/ml were reached at  <dig> hours post-infection for te/3'2j, te/3'2j/gfp, and te/3'2j/b <dig> viruses, respectively. the similar replication kinetics observed for all three viruses suggests that rnai may not be as important for antiviral immunity in vertebrate cells compared to mosquito cells.

based on our data showing increased replication of te/3'2j/b <dig> in aag <dig> cells, we tested whether te/3'2j/b <dig> would increase virus replication in mosquitoes following an infectious oral bloodmeal. at four and seven days post infection , midguts were dissected from  <dig> mosquitoes per group and, along with remaining mosquito carcasses, were titrated on vero cells. titers of infectious virus represent the extent to which virus replicated in individual mosquitoes while the total number of infected midguts and carcasses represent the infection and dissemination rates, respectively . because electroporation-derived recombinant sinvs and invertebrate cell-derived viruses produced from te/3'2j inefficiently infect mosquito midguts following oral infection, virus was passed once in vero cells prior to use in blood feeds  <cit> . te/3'2j/b <dig> virus exhibited the highest rates of infection and dissemination and the highest average titers at both time points. of  <dig> mosquitoes tested,  <dig>  had detectable te/3'2j/b <dig> virus in the midgut at four dpi, significantly more compared to te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp . infection rates increased in all three groups at seven dpi, but the number of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected mosquitoes remained significantly higher than te/3'2j  and te/3'2j/gfp . te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp virus infection rates did not differ significantly at four or seven dpi. all mosquitoes exhibiting a disseminated infection had detectable virus in the midgut. five of  <dig> mosquitoes  with detectable te/3'2j/b <dig> virus in the midgut exhibited disseminated infection at day four while no virus was detected in carcasses of mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j or te/3'2j/gfp virus. at seven dpi, 61%  of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected mosquitoes had disseminated infections, as compared to 40%  for te/3'2j- and 38%  for te/3'2j/gfp-infected mosquitoes. significantly higher average te/3'2j/b <dig> virus titers were found in the midgut at seven dpi  and in mosquito carcasses at seven dpi . average te/3'2j/b <dig> titers in the midgut at four dpi were not statistically higher . at four and seven dpi, infection and dissemination titers were not statistically different between te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp viruses.

ae. aegypti mortality associated with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection
mosquito mortality assays were performed to determine the effects of virus infection on mosquito survival. from observations made during determination of infectious virus titers in orally infected mosquitoes, we predicted that te/3'2j/b <dig> virus was able to kill mosquitoes more effectively than te/3'2j or te/3'2j/gfp. female mosquitoes were given a bloodmeal containing  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml of te/3'2j, te/3'2j/gfp, te/3'2j/b <dig>  or cell culture medium only. engorged females were separated and kept at optimal rearing conditions, including fresh sugar and water daily for  <dig> days, and individual mortality was monitored daily. beginning at four dpi, more mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus died than mock-infected mosquitoes or those infected with te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp viruses. eighty-three percent of the mosquitoes ingesting a bloodmeal containing te/3'2j/b <dig> were dead by day  <dig> versus 21% for mock, 11% for te/3'2j, and 30% for te/3'2j/gfp exposed mosquitoes . daily survival for mosquitoes that ingested te/3'2j/b <dig> virus was significantly lower than mock, te3'2j, or te/3'2j/gfp-infected mosquitoes . survival of te/3'2j-infected mosquitoes was significantly different from te/3'2j/gfp-infected mosquitoes . survival of mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp was not significantly different from mock-infected mosquitoes .

because some mosquitoes that ingested a bloodmeal may not have become infected, individual mosquitoes were intrathoracically injected with virus to more accurately correlate infection with mortality. female mosquitoes were injected with approximately  <dig> pfu of virus or cell culture medium and were monitored daily for mortality. at ten days post-infection, all mosquitoes injected with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus were dead, whereas by day  <dig>  at least 70% of mock-, te/3'2j-, and te/3'2j/gfp-injected mosquitoes survived , suggesting that te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection caused the observed mortality in ae. aegypti mosquitoes.

to determine if te/3'2j/b2-associated mortality was dose-dependent, a 50% lethal dose at seven days post-injection was determined by mosquito intrathoracic injection . groups of  <dig> mosquitoes were injected with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus diluted 10-fold in cell culture medium and monitored for mortality. te/3'2j/b <dig> infection was extremely lethal, needing less than one pfu per mosquito to cause more than 50% mortality, and was dose-dependent. the median survival time for mosquitoes was five days at the highest dose  and seven days at the lowest dose that caused more than 50% mortality .

sinv is capable of infecting many different species of mosquitoes, so te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-associated mortality following intrathoracic injection was also tested in aedes albopictus and culex tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes . female mosquitoes were injected with approximately  <dig> pfu of virus or cell culture medium as a mock-infected control and mortality was monitored daily. in both mosquito species, te/3'2j/b <dig> virus killed 100% of injected mosquitoes by 11– <dig> days post-injection. little mortality was observed in mock-, te/3'2j-, or te/3'2j/gfp- injected ae. albopictus mosquitoes . interestingly, cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes injected with te/3'2j or te/3'2j/gfp survived less well than mock infected mosquitoes .

discussion
rnai is a major antiviral response in mosquitoes. the only other described mosquito immune response to arbovirus infection is mediated by the toll antimicrobial pathway  <cit> . rnai is a highly conserved mechanism that is stimulated by the presence of an invading virus and controls viral replication through the sequence-specific degradation of the virus rna. to study rnai during sinv infection of ae. aegypti, we have engineered a double subgenomic sinv to express b <dig> protein, a potent vsr  <cit> . in a recently published study, sinv-b <dig> and onnv-b <dig> were shown to cause mortality in injected ae. aegypti and an. gambiae mosquitoes, respectively  <cit> . we show that mosquitoes infected in a more natural manner  with a b <dig> expressing sinv demonstrate increased viral titers, higher levels of viral dissemination from the midgut, and greatly enhanced virus-induced mortality in ae. aegypti, ae. albopictus, and cx. tritaeniorhynchus mosquitoes. in our system, the b <dig> protein is translated only in infected cells, avoiding potential off-target effects associated with transient dsrna-mediated silencing of the rnai pathway. tschuch et al found that introduction of sirna specific for green fluorescent protein  into human cells that did not express gfp non-specifically perturbed expression of more than  <dig> genes  <cit> . a similar non-specific dsrna-mediated regulation of gene expression has been described in sandfly  cell culture and the marine shrimp, litopenaeus vannamei  <cit> . although similar experiments have not been performed in mosquito cells, introduction of dsrna could have a similar effect. detectable, yet not statistically-significant increases in viral titer have been observed when control experiments injecting β-gal dsrna and virus into mosquitoes have been performed  <cit> . while the potential for non-specific response of the mosquito immune system to dsrna is intriguing and should be studied further, examining the rnai response using a sinv expressing a viral rnai suppressor is superior to dsrna-mediated interference of the rnai pathway.

three lines of experimental evidence suggest that the b <dig> protein was functional in rnai suppression when expressed during te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection. first, in vitro dicing experiments show inhibition sirna accumulation in cell lysates derived from te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected aag <dig> cells. the presence of b <dig> protein inhibits the accumulation of biotinylated sirnas, presumably by binding to the synthetic dsrna and sequestering from dicer- <dig>  the presence of sirnas in mock- and te/3'2j/gfp-infected lysates provides evidence that aag <dig> cells have a functional rnai mechanism. also, this shows that inhibition of sirna accumulation is specific to te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection. the second line of evidence comes from northern blot analysis of small rnas in mosquito cells. considerably less sinv-specific sirnas accumulated in cell culture and mosquitoes infected with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus compared to te/3'2j and te/3'2j/gfp virus infection. the dsrna formed by viral replicative intermediates may be bound by b <dig> protein, protecting the dsrna from detection by the rnai machinery.

finally, virus titers observed in aag <dig> cells and adult ae. aegypti mosquitoes were much higher when b <dig> protein was expressed during infection. this agrees with previous data showing that inhibition of the rnai pathway allows for arboviruses to replicate more efficiently in mosquitoes  <cit> . by injecting mosquitoes with dsrna targeting dicer- <dig> or argonaute- <dig> after an infectious bloodmeal, campbell et al  <cit>  were able to show that sinv titers in individual mosquitoes increased significantly by day four as compared to β-gal dsrna injected controls. the same effect was not seen at day seven and the authors suggest this may be due to a stimulation of the antiviral response by this time point or degradation of the dsrna triggers via decay  <cit> . a similar general phenomenon was seen with onnv infection of an. gambiae mosquitoes, with a detectable increase in virus titer up to six days post infection  <cit> . this difference may be explained by the inoculation route as both dsrna and onnv were administered intrathoracically, bypassing any infection barriers associated with the midgut and ensuring introduction of virus and dsrna into the hemocoel  <cit> . a significant increase in sinv titers was observed at both four and seven days post infectious bloodmeal in mosquitoes ingesting te/3'2j/b <dig> virus. the rnai response is continuously inhibited by b <dig> protein as it is produced in infected mosquito cells. dsrna intermediates or secondary structure of the virus genome will not be recognized by the rnai machinery, allowing virus replication to continue unabated.

our data indicate that sinv becomes pathogenic to mosquitoes when rnai is suppressed during virus infection. pathology and mortality have been associated with alphavirus infection of mosquitoes, but the pathology is specific to the midgut or salivary glands and the mortality can, in some cases, be attributed to intrathoracic inoculation of large amounts of virus  <cit> . te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-associated mortality was infection route- and mosquito species independent: significantly more ae. aegypti died when exposed to te/3'2j/b <dig> virus either orally or via injection and ae. albopictus and cx. tritaeniorhynchus were susceptible to te/3'2j/b <dig> virus following intrathoracic injection.

we originally hypothesized that the observed mortality was caused by apoptotic death of a majority of infected cells in the mosquito. fhv has been shown to induce apoptosis in drosophila cell culture through the depletion of an intracellular inhibitor of apoptosis  <cit> . apoptosis in alphavirus-infected mosquito cell lines is dependent on the amount of viral rna and infectious virus produced during infection  <cit> . we show that considerably more sinv subgenomic rna and 100-fold more infectious virus are produced in mosquitoes when b <dig> protein is expressed during infection. however, apoptosis could not be detected within infected cells in sections of virus-infected mosquitoes . it is possible that cell death caused by te/3'2j/b <dig> virus is via a non-apoptotic mechanism. necrosis has been observed in midgut epithelial cells of culiseta melanura mosquitoes orally-infected with eastern equine encephalitis virus at times corresponding to peak midgut virus titers  <cit> . electron microscopy of infected cell morphology and detailed analysis of infected mosquito gene expression using microarray analysis may help to more clearly define the mechanism of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-associated mortality.

behavioral changes have been suggested as a direct result of arbovirus infection  <cit> . te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection of the brain and sensory organs may lead to changes in mosquito behavior that could eventually lead to death such as decreased nutrient and water uptake or inability to oviposit. although not examined here, quantitative observation of behaviors such as blood feeding and oviposition may provide evidence for neurological effects associated with virus infection  <cit> .

the salivary glands are an important organ for successful transmission of arboviruses. if te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection leads to cytopathology in the salivary glands, transmission of the virus may be more efficient or could be hindered. it was suggested that sinv-associated pathology in ae. albopictus midgut-associated musculature and salivary glands could lead to a decrease in feeding success  <cit> . if this is true, then transmission of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus could be more efficient as mosquitoes take a longer time to probe the skin prior to imbibing blood. however, if salivation were compromised by virus-induced cytopathology, transmission of virus from the salivary glands would be less efficient due to decreased saliva inoculation volumes.

the b <dig> protein alone is likely not the mosquito mortality-associated factor. fhv was capable of replication to high titers when injected into ae. aegypti mosquitoes, but no mortality was associated with the infection  <cit> . also, transgenic drosophila flies that express b <dig> protein have been shown to be deficient in sirna-mediated but not microrna-mediated rna silencing and are more susceptible to rna virus infection and virus-associated mortality  <cit> . this suggests that b <dig> protein by itself is not capable of causing mortality in dipterans, but that b <dig> protein in combination with an infecting rna virus is capable of protecting virus replication from the influence of rnai. additionally, recent experiments show that a sinv expressing a b <dig> mutant incapable of binding sirnas does not suppress rnai in mosquitoes  <cit> , indicating that the sirna binding activity of b <dig> is responsible for the effect observed in our experiments.

the implications of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-associated mortality are two-fold. first, unlike pathogenic viruses that do not require persistent infection of the host, arboviruses may not encode true suppressors of rnai. b <dig> protein and many proteins produced by pathogenic plant viruses are dsrna binding proteins and potent suppressors of the rnai response. the dsrna-binding protein nss of la crosse virus, an arbovirus transmitted by ochlerotatus triseriatus mosquitoes, was initially suggested to be a vsr in mammalian cells, but was later shown to be an interferon antagonist that did not interfere with rnai in mosquito cells  <cit> . similar conclusions were made with the ns <dig> protein of influenza a virus, a non-vectored virus  <cit> . to our knowledge, there has been no description of an arbovirus-produced protein that is a vsr in mosquito cells, and our data suggest that encoding a vsr may be detrimental to arbovirus transmission.

second, mortality of te/3'2j/b <dig> virus-infected mosquitoes suggests there may be a delicate balance between mosquito immune response and virus replication that allows for the persistent nature of arbovirus infection in the vector. in the model of semliki forest virus  regulation of rna replication, production of negative-strand rna, that serves as a template for full-length virus genome and subgenomic rna, is restricted to the early phase of replication  <cit> . limiting the production of negative-strand rna may allow for more efficient allocation of cellular resources to progeny virus production and may have evolved to exclude subsequent viruses from establishing infection. it was proposed that regulation of negative-strand rna synthesis, in turn regulating full length and subgenomic positive-strand rna, evolved to moderate virus-associated virulence in the mosquito vector  <cit> . our experiments with te/3'2j/b <dig> virus suggest that the replicase proteins of sinv, which control the amounts of viral rna through sequential cleavage of polyprotein complexes, may not be the sole regulators of virus rna quantities. rather, there appears to be a balanced effort from both the virus and the mosquito immune system to regulate replication so that the virus can persist in mosquitoes without causing significant adverse effects, allowing the virus to increase its transmission efficiency to a new host. further studies could compare inhibition of sirna accumulation at early times during te/3'2j and te/3'2j/b <dig> virus infection and may shed light on the potential cooperation of viral replicase complexes and rnai response in regulation of virus rna production in mosquito cells. identifying key mosquito factors necessary for viral rna regulation may lead to novel transgenic mosquitoes that over-express these factors and are, therefore, refractory to arbovirus infection.

CONCLUSIONS
alphaviruses must be transmitted between insect and vertebrate hosts to be maintained in nature, and thus must optimize their transmission potential in each host to ensure continuity. disruption of this optimization in mosquitoes adversely affects the ability of the mosquito to control infection and results in death of the mosquito, which will reduce the fitness of the virus over time. thus it appears that alphaviruses have developed a delicate balance between robust replication and limited pathology in their mosquito hosts that allows for persistent infection and efficient vectoring.
