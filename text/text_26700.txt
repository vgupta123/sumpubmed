BACKGROUND
cyanobacteria are prokaryotic organisms that perform an oxygenic photosynthesis similar to that of higher plants, constituting the evolutionary ancestors of the chloroplast  <cit> . cyanobacteria are generally photoautotrophs fixing co <dig>  and they preferentially use ammonium as the nitrogen source, although they can also use nitrate, urea, and some amino acids. some filamentous cyanobacteria, such as the model strain anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  are also able to fix n <dig> in specialized cells called heterocysts  <cit> . the crp-family transcriptional regulator ntca, which is highly conserved in cyanobacteria, controls the response of the cell to n availability by binding to the promoter region of its target genes, activating or repressing their expression  <cit> . ntca binds as a dimer to target sites with the consensus sequence gtan8tac  <cit> . in a number of sites found in ntca-activated promoters binding of ntca in vitro increases in the presence of 2-oxoglutarate , although binding in the absence of this effector could also take place . the crystal structure of the anabaena ntca dimer has been solved in complex or not with 2-og  <cit> . similarly to crp, each ntca monomer comprises an n-terminal effector-binding domain and a c-terminal helix-turn-helix dna binding domain, both connected by a long helix  <cit> . 2-og binds at a pocket in the effector-binding domain and this binding induces changes that are transmitted to the dna-binding domain resulting in a tighter coiled-coil conformation of the two c-helices, which is better suited for dna binding  <cit> . however, whereas the apo-crp is unable of dna binding in the absence of camp, in the apo-ntca, the conformation of the helices is permissive for dna binding  <cit> , consistent with in vitro dna-binding results  <cit> .

as the first response of the cyanobacterial cell to n starvation, ntca activates the expression of genes involved in the scavenging of traces of combined n, such as the nir operon  or the amt genes   <cit> . in filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, ntca is also needed for the differentiation and function of the n2-fixing heterocysts in response to persistent n deprivation. the process of heterocyst differentiation is tightly regulated and involves a cascade of transcriptional regulators that is initiated by ntca and the heterocyst-specific regulator hetr  <cit> . some heterocyst-related genes activated by ntca are nrra and hetc , xisa and devbca , and pipx and the cox <dig>  cox <dig> and nifhdk operons   <cit> . canonical ntca-activated promoters have a consensus ntca-binding site, centered at about  <dig>  nucleotides upstream from the transcription start point  of the regulated genes, and a - <dig> box with the consensus sequence tan3t, thus matching the bacterial class ii activator-dependent promoters  <cit> . genes involved in the scavenging of traces of combined n, such as urta, nira, ntcb, and glna, bear canonical ntca-dependent promoters  <cit> . in complex promoter regions, often found in heterocyst-differentiation genes, ntca-dependent promoters showing a non-canonical structure have been found, such as in cphb <dig> or ntca <cit> . other genes such as rbcl or gor, are repressed by ntca and have a gtan8tac box downstream of the - <dig> box of the promoter  <cit> .

a prediction of new putative binding sites of ntca in different cyanobacteria, based on computational analyses, has been published  <cit> , but no in vivo confirmation of these sites has been done. on the other hand, two transcriptomic studies of the response of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> to n deprivation have been recently published. flaherty et al. <cit>  mapped transcripts produced in the whole genome, and mitschke et al. <cit>  focused on possible tsps. in order to determine the whole ntca regulon, we attempted to find out all the ntca targets present in the genome of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> using immunoprecipitation of chromatin followed by massive sequencing . this is a powerful technique that allows the identification of the in vivo binding sites of a transcription factor   <cit> . we have focused on an early time of induction after n step-down, when ntca regulates genes involved in the scavenging of traces of combined n, but also genes required for the early stages of heterocyst differentiation.

RESULTS
immunoprecipitation of ntca-bound dna
wild-type anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> cells growing in bubbled cultures with ammonium as the n source were subjected to incubation in a combined n-depleted medium for  <dig> hours, after which the cultures were treated with formaldehyde to fix the proteins bound to dna. after cell lysis and dna fragmentation, the extracts were treated with an anti-ntca antibody to specifically immunoprecipitate the ntca-bound dna . the immunoprecipitated material was then incubated at 65ºc to reverse the crosslinking, and the dna was isolated. a sample of total dna was also isolated prior to anti-ntca treatment of the extracts to serve as the control input sample.

quantitative pcr was performed to check the quality of the immunoprecipitated dna, and to confirm that known ntca target regions were enriched. primers that amplified the promoter region of nrra , as a positive control, and the promoter region of orf all <dig>  as a negative control, were used. the result of the q-pcr analysis , confirmed a substantial enrichment in the ntca-dependent promoter. immunoprecipitated and input dna samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing and the results were analyzed using the triform algorithm  <cit>  and mapped onto the genome of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit>  .

distribution of the ntca-bound dna throughout the genome of anabaena sp. pcc 7120
the analysis of immunoprecipitated dna showed  <dig>  binding regions, all of them statistically significant, located in the anabaena genome, and distributed throughout the chromosome and five of the six plasmids . we have analyzed the location of these binding regions on the anabaena genomic sequence and assigned them to one gene, two genes , or srnas . the integrative genome viewer program   <cit>  was used to map the sequences of the binding regions obtained by the chip-seq experiment onto the anabaena genome . the information of the  <dig>  binding regions obtained is shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  including the location in the chromosome or plasmids, the gene to which the binding region has been ascribed, and the statistical significance of the peak identifying the binding region  . the binding regions are about 200–250 bp long, being its midpoint the most likely position for ntca binding. since cyanobacterial 5′-utrs are frequently very long  <cit> , some binding regions have been assigned to genes that are relatively far, even if the binding regions were located inside the coding region of an adjacent gene. for these cases, we have taken into account the information about the differential expression of the genes after combined-n deprivation  <cit>  .

*total number of entries in additional file 2: table s <dig>  was used .

in order to estimate the role of ntca binding at the binding regions, the programs clc sequence viewer  and artemis genome browser   <cit>  were used to integrate the transcriptomic data from flaherty et al. <cit>  and from mischke et al. <cit>  with the location of the ntca binding region sequences obtained in our chip-seq experiment. to this end, the location of a certain binding region   was determined using the above-mentioned programs, and its genomic context was analyzed in relation to the transcripts/transcription start sites that have been described. in addition, putative ntca consensus binding sites were identified  within the sequence of the binding region . the relative location of the binding region with respect to the gene was also analyzed, and the binding regions were classified into three categories: upstream from the gene , internal to the gene , and downstream from the gene . interestingly, about 65% of the identified binding regions were found within coding regions. among those located in intergenic regions, most of them  were present upstream of the assigned genes and some  downstream of coding regions.

cthe putative ntca binding sites, - <dig> boxes and tsps are in italics. those that have been previously described are indicated in bold. in some cases, the detected ntca-binding site could be associated to two tsps, either of the same gene or of two divergent genes.

functional categories of genes with ntca-binding sites
the genes identified as ntca targets 3 h after n step-down have been classified into eight functional categories . about half of the assigned genes  encode proteins with unknown function. within the genes encoding proteins involved in cellular processes ,  <dig> were translation-related genes, including several ribosomal proteins, and  <dig> were related to transcription. among the genes encoding proteins involved in n metabolism and n fixation,  <dig> genes were involved in n scavenging and metabolism, including well-known ntca-dependent genes such as ntcb, nira, amt <dig>  cphb, etc.  <cit> .

*the eight main categories in which the assigned genes have been classified are indicated in bold.

a total of  <dig> genes encoding regulatory proteins were found, some of which were already known ntca-targets, including genes encoding the iron-responsive transcriptional repressor fura  <cit> , the regulatory factor pipx  <cit> , the two-component response regulator nrra  <cit> , and the pkn <dig> and pkn <dig> genes encoding ser/thr kinases with two-component sensor domains  <cit> . some of the newly identified regulatory genes with ntca binding regions were those encoding the transcriptional repressor smtb , the two-component response regulator rpaa, or the ser/thr phosphatase alr <dig>  interestingly, the proportion of internal ntca binding regions within the genes encoding regulatory proteins was higher than in other categories of genes. regarding metabolism-related genes, there were  <dig> from the central metabolism, including carbon-assimilation genes, and genes activated , or repressed , in the heterocysts  <cit> .

analysis of binding regions with highest nlq value
all the binding regions identified by chip-seq analysis had extremely low q values due to the exceptional quality of the deep sequencing of the immunoprecipitated dna. we have used the nlq value to analyze the binding regions, which allowed us to sort those regions with q value close to zero. a list of the  <dig> most represented binding regions  is shown in table  <dig>  within these target regions, we localized putative ntca-binding sequences, which in most cases were found around the midpoint of the target region and, whenever possible, they were correlated with previously described tsps  by comparison with the data from flaherty et al. <cit>  and mitschke et al. <cit> , as well as from individual analyses  <cit> .

some target regions were included in dna sequences that conform class-ii ntca-dependent promoters. among these is the target region with highest nlq value , which was located upstream of the orf alr <dig>  with a gtgn8tac sequence separated  <dig> nucleotides from a bulk of 5′-transcript ends activated in combined-n free medium  <cit> , which could represent a putative tsp, preceded by a - <dig> box . in others, the target region was included in dna sequences showing a repressor-like position. finally, in other target regions only a putative binding site could be found with no correlation with any known tsp. in some cases one binding site could be affecting the expression of two tsps , and in others the putative binding site could be ascribed to two genes . the target region with second highest nlq value  was located upstream of the ilvg gene encoding an enzyme of the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids, which is slightly repressed in combined n-free medium  <cit> . the ntca binding site identified in this target region, gaan8tac, overlaps a tsp that is repressed under n depleted conditions . in addition to the repressor effect described above, the ntca binding sequence upstream of ilvg is separated by  <dig> nucleotides from the - <dig> box of an n-dependent activated tsp, thus representing a putative class ii promoter activator site. this is similar to what we have found for the target region located upstream of glna, which has already been described .

figure  <dig> shows two examples of target regions whose sequences contained a class-ii ntca-dependent promoter structure. one is the well-known ntca-dependent gene ntcb, whose promoter determinants have already been described  <cit>  . the other example is a high-nlq target region mapped inside the orf alr <dig> , whose sequence also showed a class-ii ntca-activated promoter structure that could be regulating an internal tsp activated under n deprivation  <cit> .

in vitro binding of ntca
in order to corroborate our results, we first checked whether our chip-seq analysis identified already known ntca binding sites located in promoter regions of genes regulated by this transcription factor. indeed, additional file 4: table s <dig> shows eighteen target regions indentified in this work which include ntca binding sites identified previously by different means, such as those corresponding to the nitrate assimilation genes nira and ntcb, the ammonium assimilation gene glna, and the heterocyst-related genes hetc, xisa and devb, among others.

additionally, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  were performed to check the capability of ntca to bind in vitro to dna fragments included in different binding regions  identified in this study. target regions # <dig> and # <dig>  were used as positive controls. as negative controls, we used a dna fragment upstream of all <dig>  an internal region of nrra, and the promoter region of the amaranthus hybridus psba gene, which have not been described as ntca targets. a selection of twelve binding regions with different features were tested. we included binding regions with low nlq , and with high nlq . the analyzed binding regions were located intragenically , upstream , or downstream  of genes. a putative consensus ntca binding site was identified in binding regions # <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  while binding regions # <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were found close to a tsp  . several concentrations of ntca were used in the emsa assays and, in general, there was a correlation between nlq and the affinity of ntca for the binding region, which indicated the quality of the results. ntca showed a higher affinity for binding regions with high nlq than for those with low nlq, regardless of the position of the binding regions with respect to the genes.

consensus ntca-binding site
an initial cisfinder analysis of the whole data resulting from the deep-sequencing of the immunoprecipitated dna, using randomly located subsequences as control, showed a predominant target region-specific motif: gtan8tac. we have done additional analyses of the ntca binding sequences identified using the weblogo application  <cit>  . the consensus sequence of three different groups of ntca binding sites have been analyzed. the first included the putative ntca sequences identified in the  <dig> target regions with highest nlq . the well-known ntca-binding site sequence  <cit>  was obtained, having somewhat conserved t and c nucleotides in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  and a in positions  <dig> and  <dig>  when the  <dig> putative ntca sequences identified  were analyzed, the ntca consensus binding site shown in figure 4b was obtained. in this case, the gtn10ac was highly conserved, with also some prevalence of an a at position  <dig> and a t at position  <dig>  finally, we did an analysis of the extended ntca binding site . in this case, a total of  <dig> sequences were used, obtained either from the target regions with highest nlq or those ntca binding sites that were associated with a promoter . a clear conservation along a  <dig> nt-long sequence was observed, specially the occurrence of a/t pairs in positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , consistent with previous observations  <cit> .

discussion
ntca is a transcriptional regulator of the crp family that has been described to act upstream of the regulated genes, usually as an activator, but also as a repressor  <cit> . by chip-seq analysis we have found that ntca binds to up to  <dig>  genomic sites, including sites in the chromosome and five of the six plasmids present in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  the fact that no binding regions were found associated to plasmid zeta is probably due to the small size of this plasmid . the  <dig>  ntca targets found by chip-seq analysis have been ascribed to  <dig>  genes. a numerous group of already-known ntca-binding sites have been identified in the target regions found in this study , which validates the results of the chip-seq analysis. additionally, we have found that ntca binds in vitro to a selection of target regions with different features  , which further indicates that the target regions identified by chip-seq are bona-fide targets of ntca. it is worth noting that point mutations in dna sites matching the consensual sequence gtan8tac affect ntca binding, as it has been previously shown for the promoter region of glna   <cit>  and the two ntca binding sites of the ntca promoter   <cit> .

a very high proportion of target regions have been found located in internal positions of the genes and even downstream of coding regions . not only our results with ntca in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  but many other examples show that regulation by transcription factors is much more complex than the canonical model. one fourth of the binding sites of s. enterica ompr  <cit>  and 42% of the binding sites for c. glutamicum glxr  <cit>  were found in intragenic regions. by binding to intragenic target regions, ntca could act canonically by regulating internal tsps as a class ii activator. in fact, some internal target regions found in our chip-seq experiment seem to include sites regulating internal tsps, both in the same orientation as the genes or counter-oriented , which may correspond to overlapping as yet non-annotated genes, to antisense transcripts, or to non-coding transcription. some examples of internal target regions in which ntca would be acting canonically are # <dig> , # <dig> , # <dig> , or # <dig>  . another possibility for the intragenic target regions is that ntca could act as a repressor by blocking transcription elongation, as it has been shown for cody in b. subtilis <cit> . ntca could be also regulating the promoters of adjacent genes with long 5′-utrs. finally, ntca could be acting non-canonically by binding to intragenic regions in which not even a consensus ntca binding site can be found, such as target regions # <dig>  or # <dig> , for which we have detected binding of ntca in vitro . in this context, it is worth noting that ntca has been shown to regulate the proximal promoter of devb by binding to a site  quite deviated from the consensual ntca binding sequence  <cit> , and so it is possible that, in some cases, ntca acts as a transcriptional regulator by binding to sequences that we are not able to predict as ntca-binding sites.

by means of chip-chip analysis in e. coli, the global transcriptional regulator crp has been shown to bind to  <dig> high-affinity sites, while showing an extensive background binding that the authors interpret as low-affinity interaction of crp to thousands of sites  <cit> . the authors suggest that crp acts, in addition to directly regulating transcription, as a chromosome-shaping protein by binding to those multiple low affinity sites. on the other hand, chip-seq analyses carried out with  <dig> tfs of mycobacterium tuberculosis in which binding sites are found in diverse genomic locations suggest that modulation of dna structure might be a general role of tfs  <cit> . our data suggests that ntca could act similarly in those sites where it binds with a low affinity and for which no consensus-binding site can be found. there are  <dig> binding regions with nlq< <dig>   <dig> of which are located in internal or downstream positions , and only  <dig>  upstream of genes. the role of ntca as a chromosome-shaping factor instead of crp would be consistent with a more restricted role of crp-like proteins in the obligate photoautotroph anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> .

the high number of target regions not directly associated to tsps could be reflecting an additional level of complexity, such as of long-range interactions of ntca with the regulated promoters  <cit> . this would especially apply to internal target regions, to those located upstream but far from the coding region, and to regions located downstream of genes. long-range effects of a tf can be achieved by cooperative binding to several binding sites or by dna looping. in this case, the low-affinity sites would be acting cooperatively together with other, high-affinity, sites  <cit> . there are some individual examples of regulation at atypical distances, such as that carried out by b. subtilis rocr, which regulates rocg expression by binding to an enhancer located  <dig>  kb downstream of the rocg promoter  <cit> , or that by e. coli ntrc, whose binding sites at the σ54-dependent promoter of glna can be located up to 2 kb away  <cit> . some putative examples of long-range effects of ntca could be two high-nlq target regions in which a consensus ntca-binding site can be identified, target regions # <dig>  and # <dig>  , but no obvious relation with a promoter can be found.

it is interesting to note the prediction that the higher the nlq the more ntca protein binding to a particular sequence. indeed, we have seen a correlation between the nlq and the affinity of ntca for the target region in vitro . according to galagan et al. <cit> , differences in the probability of occupancy of a tf are influenced by several factors including the concentration and modification state of the tf, the affinity of the tf for the binding site, the accessibility of the binding site, and the availability of molecular co-factors. in organisms with different cell-types, more complexity can be added, since there are differences in gene regulation between different cell types. this is the case of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig> growing in a combined n-free medium, whose filaments contain vegetative cells and differentiating and mature heterocysts.

the  <dig>  genes associated to the  <dig>  binding regions found in this chip analysis have been classified according to the functional category of their protein products. these include known targets of ntca involved in the scavenging of traces of combined n, such as the amt genes, ntcb, and the nir and urt operons, as well as other targets, such as the cphba <dig> operon, hetc and nrra, which are also activated early upon n step-down . interestingly, however, only a small fraction of all the ascribed genes are involved in n metabolism  and in differentiation and function of heterocysts . in contrast, a similar or even higher proportion of genes related to regulatory  and transport  functions  were found. it is also noticeable that there is a substantial number of genes involved in translation, including several ribosomal protein-encoding genes , genes of the central metabolism of the cell , and genes involved in the biosynthesis of cofactors, prosthetic groups and electron carriers . finally, ca. 50% of the ascribed genes in the chip-seq analysis correspond to hypothetical or unknown proteins . interestingly, besides the already known ntca targets fura, pkn <dig> and pkn <dig> <cit> , which are involved in the regulation of iron acquisition-related genes, there are about  <dig> iron acquisition-related genes that appear to be directly regulated by ntca . these results represent an in vivo corroboration of a cross-talk regulation between n and fe metabolisms that has been proposed to happen in anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, a substantial group of genes involved in carbon metabolism are also found ascribed to target regions. these include the pentose-phosphate pathway genes gnd, alr <dig>  alr <dig> and all <dig>  the calvin cycle rbclxs operon and all <dig>  and many others , such as the cmpr gene, whose product activates the expression of the cmp bicarbonate transporter genes and is regulated by ntca  <cit> . these results support the idea of ntca as a regulator of carbon assimilation genes, as previously suggested  <cit> . finally, there is a numerous group of photosynthesis- and respiration-related genes associated to target regions, such as several genes encoding nadh dehydrogenases and atp synthases, genes of the photosystem i and photosystem ii, and several terminal respiratory oxidase-encoding genes, including the previously described ntca-dependent cox <dig> and cox <dig> operons  <cit>  . it is interesting to note that there are twice as many ascribed n metabolism-related genes among the target regions with q value= <dig> than within all the target regions  . in addition, 75% of the high-nlq target regions ascribed to n-metabolism related genes were located in positions upstream of coding regions. this is consistent with the fact that ntca was originally discovered in studies of regulation of n assimilation  <cit> .

many genes that were expected to be activated later on after n step-down have been detected to be bound by ntca in vivo at 3 h after combined-n deprivation. some are involved in heterocyst differentiation and function, such as xisa or devbca , but also pipx and the cox <dig> and nifhdk operons , which are already known targets, as well as others such as some genes of the hep island, hgdd, nifv <dig>  nifs, hepb, hepk, hetm, hetn, and genes encoding several heterocyst-glycolipid synthases  . these results indicate that ntca binds in vivo to genes that have not been shown to be differentially expressed as soon as 3 h after n step-down. in some cases, including those target regions with nlq< <dig>  ntca could bind with low affinity, so that relevant binding would require a higher concentration of ntca, an additional factor, or both . the ntca gene is maximally expressed at ca. 9 h upon n step-down  <cit> . it is possible therefore that binding of ntca can be detected as early as 3 h upon n step-down, but this binding would not be sufficient to activate the expression of those genes until the concentration of ntca increases. it can also be the case, especially for those targets with high nlq, that the process of gene activation/repression starts earlier than it can be detected by conventional procedures.

a computational analysis of cis-regulatory elements located upstream of coding regions carried out by su et al. <cit>  predicted  <dig> putative ntca binding sites in the genome of anabaena sp. pcc  <dig>  a comparison of these putative sites with our in vivo results rendered  <dig> common sites , including three in photosynthesis-related genes  and several in n-scavenging genes . on the other hand, a sequence analysis of upstream regions of highly induced or repressed tsps carried out by mitschke et al. <cit>  predicted  <dig> putative ntca binding sites. this analysis was based on a search of the consensus binding site of ntca in regions near tsps that were highly regulated at 8 h after n-withdrawal. additional file 6: table s <dig> shows a comparison between these sites and the ntca binding sites identified by our in vivo chip-seq analysis, which rendered  <dig> sites in common, including some located within coding regions.

the high number of binding regions found as well as the broad distribution of the ascribed genes in functional categories indicate that ntca has a much wider role in the cyanobacterial cell than it had previously been assigned. moreover, the fact that a high number of genes involved in regulatory functions appear to be regulated by ntca implies an even broader role of this protein, since further genes may be indirectly regulated by ntca. in spite of the binding regions with nlq< <dig>  at which ntca might be acting as a chromosome shaper, ntca is the bacterial transcription factor for which the largest direct regulon has been identified by in vivo chip experiments. corynebacterium glutamicum glxr, a camp-dependent crp-type global transcriptional regulator, has been described to bind up to  <dig> sites  <cit> , while others with a less wide role, such as mycobacterium tuberculosis lexa or salmonella enterica ompr, have been found to bind  <dig> and  <dig> sites, respectively  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the ntca regulon identified here constitutes the largest bacterial regulon described to date. although initially identified in studies of regulation of n assimilation, we have shown by in vivo chip-seq that ntca has a much wider role in the physiology of the cell. ntca can have a genomic-wide effect both as a possible chromosome  shaper and as a global transcription factor in the cyanobacterial cell.
