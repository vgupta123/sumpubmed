BACKGROUND
tuberculosis  is a global public health problem caused by an infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis. there were approximately  <dig> million new cases of tb and  <dig>  million deaths in  <dig>  <cit> . the emergence of multidrug-resistant tb  and extensively drug-resistant tb  remains a global health problem that hinders the prevention, treatment, and control of tb. in thailand, approximately  <dig>  new tb cases were notified in  <dig> and mdr-tb appeared in  <dig> % and 35% of new tb cases and previously treated tb cases, respectively  <cit> .

rapid identification of drug-resistant strains is one of the major strategies for fighting against tb. molecular-based methods for detection of drug resistance genes have been shown to be a promising method for identification of drug-resistant strains; for example, the xpert mtb/rif assay and the genotype mtbdrplus assay have been successfully used to identify rifampicin-resistant m. tuberculosis and mdr-tb, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, knowledge concerning resistance mechanisms of the second-line anti-tb drugs is still limited. better understanding of the resistance mechanisms of these drugs could lead to the development of a high sensitive test for detection of the resistance genes and also promote the use of molecular-based methods for screening the strains resistant to second-line drugs, including the xdr-tb strain.

the aminoglycosides amikacin  and kanamycin  are the second-line injectable drugs used to treat mdr-tb. the drugs bind to 16s rrna in the 30s small ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis  <cit> . mutations in the rrs gene encoding 16s rrna are associated with high-level drug resistance in m. tuberculosis; the rrs a1401g mutation is the most frequently reported mutation and has been identified in  <dig> to 90% of km-resistant m. tuberculosis strains  <cit> .

recently, overexpression of the aminoglycoside acetyltransferase-encoding gene, eis, has been associated with a low-level resistance to km  <cit> . this overexpression resulted from either point mutations in the promoter region of the eis gene or mutations in the 5′ untranslated region  of the whib <dig> gene, which encodes a putative regulator of the eis gene. this type of eis promoter mutation was found in 26-80% of km-resistant m. tuberculosis clinical strains  <cit> . however, some resistant strains do not contain any known mutations. other possible resistance mechanisms, including the presence of drug efflux pumps or enzymes that can inactivate the drug or modify the drug target, have been proposed. tap, a putative efflux pump that was originally described in mycobacterium fortuitum, conferred resistance to tetracycline and aminoglycosides when introduced into m. smegmatis <cit> . a homolog of this protein  has been found in m. tuberculosis and functions under the control of whib <dig>  <cit> .

previous studies demonstrated that the rrs mutation conferring km resistance also exhibited the cross-resistance to capreomycin , a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic  <cit> . capreomycin binds across the 23s rrna helix  <dig> and 16s rrna helix  <dig> of the ribosome, resulting in inhibiting the protein synthesis  <cit> . resistance to cap has been reported to correlate with the gene encoding 2´-o-methyltransferase   <cit> , although it is not a sensitive genetic marker for cap resistance due to the infrequent finding  <cit> . tlya functions by methylating at nucleotide c <dig> in helix  <dig> of 16s rrna and nucleotide c <dig> in helix  <dig> of 23s rrna. loss of this methylation confers resistance to cap and viomycin  <cit> .

the present study aimed to validate all reported mechanisms associated with ak, km and cap resistance in m/xdr-tb clinical strains isolated in thailand. moreover, these mechanisms were also investigated in km–susceptible strains.

RESULTS
amikacin- and kanamycin-resistant phenotypes
a total of  <dig>  m. tuberculosis clinical strains were isolated from  <dig>  smear-positive sputum samples sent from  <dig> hospitals in  <dig> of  <dig> provinces of thailand. phenotypic analysis identified  <dig>  strains as mdr-tb. using the standard proportion method on m7h <dig> agar with a single concentration of 1 μg/ml for ofloxacin and 6 μg/ml for ak and km,  <dig> strains were defined as xdr-tb. twenty-nine km-resistant strains  could be retrieved and available for further investigation on the genes associated with ak, km, and cap resistance . mics of am, km, and cap were determined, and the results are summarized in table  <dig>

molecular analysis of genes associated with amikacin, kanamycin, and capreomycin resistance
the 16s rrna genes  of all  <dig> km-resistant strains were amplified and sequenced. the results revealed a point mutation at nucleotide position  <dig> , which corresponds to position  <dig> of the escherichia coli rrs gene, in  <dig> strains . almost all strains harboring the rrs a1401g mutation showed a high-level of resistance to both ak and km, with mics >64 μg/ml, whereas variable mics were found against cap, with ranging from  <dig> to >64 μg/ml .

the nucleotide sequences of coding regions and the putative promoter regions of eis  and whib <dig> , coding regions of tap  and tlya , were investigated in all km-resistant clinical strains and  <dig> km-susceptible clinical strains. no mutation of all investigated genes  was found in  <dig> strains with rrs mutation. for the remaining eight km-resistant strains, point mutations at either position - <dig>  or position - <dig>  upstream of the eis gene were observed in  <dig> strains; the c-14 t mutation was found in  <dig> strains, whereas the g-37 t mutation was found in only one strain . no eis mutations were found in  <dig> km-susceptible strains . sequence analysis of the whib <dig> gene and its promoter region did not reveal any mutations in all km-resistant and -susceptible strains .

investigation of the tap gene in km-resistant strains revealed that almost all strains  with beijing genotype exhibited the insertion of cytosine between position  <dig> and  <dig> of the tap gene . this insertion caused a frameshift mutation and a premature stop codon, resulting in the production of a truncated protein . however, analysis of km-susceptible strains also revealed this mutation  .

sequence analysis of the tlya gene revealed a → g nucleotide substitution at position  <dig> in all km-resistant strains; however this mutation did not confer any amino acid change . two cap-resistant strains showed the t → g nucleotide substitution at position  <dig> of tlya that caused the amino acid change from lysine to arginine  at codon  <dig> . one strain showed an insertion of gc at position  <dig>  resulting in a frameshift mutation and the reduction of amino acid size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . however, the a33g mutation, but not other tlya mutations, was also found in all susceptible strains .

discussion
in this study, the genetic mutations associated with resistance to ak, km, and cap were investigated in  <dig> xdr- and  <dig> mdr-tb strains isolated in thailand. a nucleotide substitution from a to g at position  <dig>  of the rrs gene is the most common mutation conferring high-level resistance to ak and km in m. tuberculosis. although approximately 30-90% of resistant strains contain this mutation  <cit> , other mutations, including c1402t and g1484t, have also been reported  <cit> . the a1401g mutation has been preferentially used as a surrogate marker for resistance to ak and km, whereas other rrs mutations are poor markers due to their presence in susceptible strains  <cit> . our results revealed that the a1401g mutation was present in  <dig> of  <dig> km-resistant clinical strains, and no other rrs mutations were identified . almost all of these strains  had mics >64 μg/ml for both ak and km while they showed broad mics ranging from  <dig> to 64 μg/ml for cap. this is consistent with previous studies reporting that the rrs a1401g mutation is the most common mechanism of km resistance and correlates with high-level resistance  <cit> . in addition, this mutation also confers cross-resistance to cap  <cit> . the eight km-resistant strains lacking the rrs mutation showed high-level resistance to km , but five of them had a lower mic for ak , indicating that other resistance determinants are involved in their resistance phenotype.

investigation of other reported resistance mechanisms revealed that five of them had mutations in the promoter region of the eis gene, which encodes an aminoglycoside acetyltransferase . this aminoglycoside acetyltransferase  catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzyme a to an amine group of aminoglycoside. it has been reported that eis of m. tuberculosis shows a multiacetylation capability at the 2′-, 3- or 6′ positions of aminoglycoside antibiotics, resulting in an inactivation of many aminoglycoside antibiotics, including neamine, hygromycin, kanamycin, and amikacin  <cit> . in this study, all five strains harboring eis promoter mutations showed high-level km resistance but low-level resistance to ak. the most identified mutation was c-14 t . these mutations and other eis mutations, such as g-6 t, g-10a, c-12 t, a-13g and c-15 t, have been previously shown to be associated with km resistance  <cit> . zaunbrecher et al.  have reported that the major eis promoter mutations were g-10a and c-14 t  <cit> . overexpression of eis resulting from the c-14 t mutation caused the highest levels of eis transcript, followed by g-37 t, g-10a, c-12 t and a-13g mutations  <cit> . in contrast to the previous study indicating that overexpression of eis confers low-level resistance to km  <cit> , our results revealed that the strains harboring eis mutation expressed high-level resistance to km. one possible explanation is that these strains have additional unknown mechanisms contributing to their km resistance, and these generate high-level resistance in combination with the eis mutation.

other resistance determinants that are thought to be involved in resistance to ak, km, and other structurally unrelated aminoglycosides  were also investigated in this study. the tap protein is a putative multidrug efflux pump that was originally described in m. fortuitum <cit> . rv1258c encodes the homologous tap protein in m. tuberculosis. introduction of the tap gene from m. fortuitum into m. smegmatis conferred low-level resistance to tetracycline and aminoglycosides  <cit> . our results revealed an insertion of cytosine between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of tap in  <dig> of  <dig> km-resistant strains. this mutation leads to a frameshift mutation at codon  <dig> resulting in the production of a truncated protein, reduced in size from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids, that is likely to affect tap activity. however, this insertion was also found in km-susceptible clinical strains, suggesting that this protein is not associated with ak and km resistance in m. tuberculosis. interestingly, all of these tap mutation was found in the beijing strains. this result was consistent with recent studies demonstrated that this type of mutation was found in all m. tuberculosis beijing strains isolated from russia, south africa, the united kingdom, and spain  <cit>  and confirmed the observation that an insertion of cytosine between positions  <dig> and  <dig> of tap is a polymorphism specific to the beijing family of m. tuberculosis <cit> .

an association of whib <dig>  a transcriptional regulator, with the expression of at least two antibiotic resistance genes, eis and tap has been demonstrated  <cit> . an increase in whib <dig> expression, resulting from mutations located in the 5′ untranslated region , leads to upregulation of eis and tap, conferring low-level resistance to km and streptomycin, respectively  <cit> . investigation of this gene and its 5′ utr revealed no mutations in any km-resistant and -susceptible strains. however, its expression level was not determined in this study.

previous report revealed that lack of 2′-o-methyltranferase, which is encoded by tlya and functions by methylation of specific nucleotides in 16s rrna and 23s rrna, resulted in cap resistance  <cit> . investigation of the tlya showed that all tested strains had the a33g substitution without any amino acid changes, suggesting that this mutation is only nucleotide polymorphism and not associated with the resistant phenotype. other tlya mutations, t539g and ins49gc, were found in two and one cap-resistant strains, respectively, but were not found in all cap-susceptible strains. these strains exhibited the high-level resistance to cap with mic greater than 64 μg/ml and did not contain the rrs mutation, indicating that these mutations were expectedly associated with cap resistance  <cit> . most recently, the t539g has been reported in capreomycin-resistant isolates in korea but with low percentage   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the most frequent ak- and km-resistant mechanism in m. tuberculosis clinical strains isolated in thailand was the rrs a1401g mutation . this mutation correlated with high-level resistance to both ak and km, and also showed cross-resistance to cap. mutations of the eis promoter region are associated with low-level resistance to ak and found in  <dig> out of  <dig> km-resistant strains. two types of mutations at tlya were found in this study and might be associated with cap resistance. identification of the resistant mechanisms, particularly a novel mechanism, is important for the development of surrogate markers that can be combined with other known resistance determinants to improve the rapid detection of drug-resistant m. tuberculosis strains.
