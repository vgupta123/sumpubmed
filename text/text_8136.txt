BACKGROUND
the fgf- <dig> gene is post-transcriptionally regulated by an endogenous complementary  mrna transcribed from the gfg/nudt <dig> gene on the opposite dna strand . the fgf antisense  transcript was first identified in xenopus laevis  <cit>  and has since been identified in a variety of other vertebrate species including chicken  <cit> , rat  <cit>  and human  <cit> . the highly conserved organization and sequence of the fgf- <dig> and gfg genes across many vertebrate species suggest that this structural relationship has an important function. the sense and antisense rnas form stable dsrna complexes in vivo and it is believed that antisense rna plays a role in the regulation of fgf- <dig> mrna stability  <cit>  and translation  <cit> . the inverse association between fgf- <dig> and fgf-as mrna levels in a variety of tissues during development supports the notion of a regulatory function of the antisense rna  <cit> . we recently reported that overexpression of fgf-as reduced cellular fgf- <dig> content and delayed s-phase progression in a rat glioma cell line  <cit> .

in addition to its role as a regulatory rna, the fgf-as transcript encodes gfg, an evolutionarily conserved nudix motif protein of unknown function  <cit> . gfg belongs to the nudix hydrolase  superfamily, characterized by a consensus signature sequence gx5ex7reuxeexgu , where x may be any amino acid and u represents one of the bulky hydrophobic amino acids, usually ile, leu or val  <cit> . the major substrates of these hydrolase enzymes are nucleoside diphosphates linked to some other moiety x, hence the acronym nudix  <cit> . the founding member of this family, the prokaryotic mutt protein, is responsible for removing 8-oxo-dgtp from the nucleotide pool, thus preventing transversion mutations caused by mis-incorporation of 8-oxo-guanine residues into dna  <cit> . the interpro database  <cit>  currently contains  <dig> nudix motif proteins from over  <dig> species ranging from viruses to man. nudix hydrolases can be grouped into distinct subfamilies according to their specificities for substrates, including intact and oxidatively damaged nucleoside triphosphates, dinucleoside polyphosphates, nucleotide sugars, nadh, adp-ribose, dinucleotide coenzymes, and mrna .

in humans, alternative splicing of the fgf-as mrna gives rise to  <dig> isoforms of gfg, the largest of which contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence . we recently demonstrated that the mts is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial targeting of hgfga, whereas hgfgb and hgfgc are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . in rat the fgf-as mrna is also alternatively spliced, resulting in at least  <dig> transcripts  <cit> , but the subcellular distribution of their protein products is unclear. our initial immunohistochemical characterization using antibodies against the nudix domain, and c-terminal peptide of rat gfg, indicated a predominantly nuclear localization in liver. however, western blotting of liver subcellular fractions identified gfg immunoreactivity in both the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions  <cit> . in contrast, localization was exclusively cytoplasmic in transiently and stably transfected rat pituitary-derived gh <dig> mammosomatotroph cells  <cit>  but both cytoplasmic and nuclear in a rat lymphoma cell line  <cit> . the diverse subcellular localization of gfg could reflect either differential subcellular trafficking of the alternatively spliced isoforms, or interaction with lineage-dependent cell-specific factors. determining the subcellular localization of gfg isoforms may provide insight into their function in the cell.

we focused here on elucidating the expression and subcellular distribution of the previously identified rat gfg isoforms  <cit> . using computational analysis, we identified a putative mitochondrial targeting signal peptide  at the n-termini of gfg proteins in a variety of animal species including rat. confocal laser scanning microscopy of cells transiently or stably transfected with individual gfg-gfp fusion constructs and deletion mutants revealed that recombinant rat gfg isoforms are targeted to mitochondria by means of the n-terminal mts, while gfg proteins lacking the mts are distributed in cytoplasm and nucleus. this pattern of distribution is consistent with the tissue specific expression of gfg in a variety of tissues.

RESULTS
computational analysis of gfg mrnas and their protein products
the rat fgf2/gfg gene locus maps to 2q <dig> and covers more than  <dig> kb. the full-length rat fgf- <dig> mrna contains  <dig> exons and encodes at least  <dig> fgf- <dig> isoforms derived by alternative translation initiation. the overlapping gfg mrna contains five exons and encodes a  <dig> kda nudix-motif protein  <cit> . two alternative splicing variants, gfgΔ <dig>  lacking exon  <dig> and gfgΔ2/ <dig>  lacking exons  <dig> and  <dig> encode, respectively, rgfgΔ <dig>  a  <dig> kda nudix-motif protein, and rgfgΔ2/ <dig>  a  <dig> kda protein lacking a nudix motif  <cit> . antisera against the cooh-terminal or the nudix domain detect the full length  and gfgΔ <dig>  isoforms in homogenates of rat c <dig> glioma cells and in normal rat liver  <cit> . the predicted gfgΔ2/ <dig> isoform does not contain the epitopes recognized by either of these antisera as the splice event introduces shift in the open reading frame, upstream of the mutt domain  <cit> . in addition to the gfg isoforms shown here, the celera rat genome assembly database also predicts  <dig> n-terminally truncated gfg isoforms consisting of the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  and c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  relative to the full length  <dig> kda protein  <cit> .

gfg contains a mitochondrial targeting signal peptide
the sequence of gfg is evolutionarily conserved from insects to humans particularly in the region of the nudix box domain . although the sequences are more divergent at the n-terminus, comparison of twelve gfg homologues from a variety of animal species identified a potential mitochondrial targeting signal  sequence at the n-terminus in all species examined . in contrast, gfg homologues from plants did not contain an identifiable n-terminal mts . except for the mts and the conserved nudix signature sequence, no other functional motifs or subcellular localization signal sequences were identified in any gfg homologues . targetp and ipsort identified an n-terminal signal peptide or subcellular compartment targeting presequence. in human only the hgfga isoform contains an mts sequence  <cit> . in contrast, in the rat exon  <dig> is common to all three previously characterized fgf-as splice variants, and all three rat gfg isoforms contain a putative mts . however, the celera rat genome assembly database also predicts an n-terminally truncated rgfg lacking the mts sequence . this predicted isoform shares more than 80% amino acid identity with human gfgb , which we have previously shown to be localized to cytoplasm and nuclei  <cit> .

although the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the full length rgfg differs from that of hgfga, it is structurally similar, with a high content of positively charged residues,  as well as hydrophobic and hydroxylated amino-acid residues. furthermore, the n-terminus contains a potential mitochondrial processing peptidase cleavage site between residues  <dig> and  <dig> . secondary structure prediction with antheprot shows that amino acids 3– <dig> of rgfg  can potentially form an amphiphilic α-helix . these features are common to several well-characterized mitochondrial translocation signals  <cit> . unlike in human, the n-terminal sequence of rat and mouse gfg also contains a monobasic prohormone cleavage site at arginine  <dig> . cleavage at this site eliminates the mts, raising the possibility that alternative postranslational processing may also play a role in determining the subcellular distribution of rat gfg.

expression of gfg isoforms in rat tissues
expression of the fgf- <dig> and fgf-as and their encoded proteins was examined in normal rat tissues. pcr of fgf-as was performed using isoform-specific primer pairs to selectively amplify each of the major fgf-as splice variants from commercially available rat multi-tissue cdna panels. as shown in fig.  <dig>  gfg mrna transcripts were detected in all tissues examined, although tissue-specific differences in isoform expression were observed. only liver, kidney and skeletal muscle expressed all three fgf-as isoforms at readily detectable levels. in contrast, in lung all transcripts of fgf-as mrna were at the limit of detection. the full-length transcript was abundantly expressed in liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle, but not in heart or brain, which exclusively expressed the alternatively spliced transcripts. fgf- <dig> was detected in all tissues examined except liver. there was no obvious association between the level of fgf- <dig> and fgf-as mrna abundance in the tissues examined.

immunohistochemistry using a polyclonal antibody against the common c-terminus of gfg revealed that subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity was also tissue-specific . gfg was strongly detected in both the cytoplasm and nuclei in many tissues, including liver, pancreas, kidney, testis, adrenal medulla, and in both small and large bowel. fgf- <dig> and gfg were co-localized in some, but not all tissues. in liver , fgf- <dig> staining  was strongly and exclusively cytoplasmic whereas gfg immunoreactivity  was detected weakly in cytoplasm and strongly in nucleus. in contrast, fgf- <dig> and gfg were co-localized in the nuclei of kidney glomerular endothelial cells and peritubular capillaries . consistent with our previous observations in human tissues, gfg was strongly expressed in the gastrointenstinal tract . these observations suggest that subcellular localization of gfg is tissue-specific, and possibly isoform-dependent.

subcellular distribution of rat gfg
although computational analysis predicts an n-terminal mts in rat gfg, our previous results identified rat gfg immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of transiently or stably transfected rat pituitary gh <dig> cells  <cit>  and in the nucleus of rat c <dig> glioma cells  <cit> . to confirm the predicted n-terminal mts experimentally, and to clarify these conflicting results, we examined the subcellular distribution of rat gfg using rgfg-gfp fusion constructs. the rat fgf-as cdna containing the complete open reading frame of gfg was fused in-frame to the 5'-end of green fluorescent protein  gene and inserted in a mammalian expression vector . the resulting plasmid dna was first transiently transfected in the glioma c <dig> cells and its subcellular distribution pattern in live cells was monitored with confocal laser scanning microscopy 12– <dig> hours post transfection.

the green fluorescence of the fusion protein was exclusively detected in mitochondrial-like structures , while the green fluorescence of free gfp was evenly distributed in cytoplasm and nucleus . the mitochondrial localization of the rgfg-gfp fusion protein was further confirmed by dual monitoring of the red fluorescence of mitotracker  and the green fluorescence of gfp. the yellow color in the merged images confirms that rgfg-gfp co-localizes with the mitotracker dye in mitochondria. expression of rgfg in stably transfected cells  gave the same results, indicating that the transfection method employed does not affect the subcellular distribution of gfg.

to confirm the integrity of the fusion protein and its subcellular targeting, a fractionation assay was conducted for immunodetection of the fusion protein in isolated mitochondrial  and nuclear  fractions. immunodetection of hsp <dig> was used as a marker of mitochondrial enrichment . no gfp immunoreactivity was detected in the wild type c <dig> cell, indicating the specificity of the gfp antibody . a ~ <dig> kda protein, the expected size of the gfg-gfp fusion protein, was predominantly identified in the mitochondrial fraction of transfected cells , although a fainter band was also detected in cytoplasmic + nuclear  fraction . the mitochondrial isolation kit used in this study yields highly purified mitochondria, but it does not remove all mitochondria from the remaining cytosolic + nuclear fraction, and it is likely that the immunoreactive band in the c/n fraction is of mitochondrial origin. this interpretation is supported by the confocal immunofluorescence data, which shows exclusive localization of gfg-gfp to the mitochondria. a  <dig> kda protein, the expected size of free gfp, was exclusively detected in the c/n fraction , but not in the mitochondrial fraction  of the cells expressing gfp alone, confirming that mitochondrial targeting is gfg-specific. subcellular fractionation into nuclear vs. cytoplasmic + mitochondrial  fractions gave similar results . rgfg-gfp was detected chiefly in the c/m fractions . although a small amount of gfg was detected in the nuclear fraction following subcellular fractionation  immunofluorescence was exclusively detected in mitochondria in intact cells . high molecular weight bands detected for both the gfg-gfp and Δn28gfg-gfp constructs are consistent with the molecular mass of possible gfg-gfp dimers  whereas free gfp  was detected only in its monomeric form. dimerization of gfg would be consistent with the physiologically active form of many other nudix motif proteins  <cit> , and we have recently demonstrated that human gfg exists in dimeric form in vivo  <cit> .

the n-terminal mts is necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial localization
in order to confirm the role of the putative n-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, a gfg-gfp expression construct containing only the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of rgfg was designed . this construct was sufficient to target gfp to mitochondria in both stable and transient transfectants , demonstrating that the c-terminal  <dig> residue region of rgfg is not required for mitochondrial targeting. in the western blots, the ~ <dig> kda band detected in the mitochondrial fractions of the cells stably expressing n <dig> was smaller than the expected size , consistent with cleavage of the mts by mitochondrial signal peptidase . the distribution of n <dig> fusion product in the cytoplasmic vs. mitochondrial fraction was increased slightly compared to the full length gfg-gfp construct . this may be due to decreased stability and consequent degradation of the deletion mutant protein during the protein isolation procedures. the confocal images confirm exclusive mitochondrial localization of the n <dig> deletion mutant in intact cells. a construct lacking the amino-terminal  <dig> amino acids of gfg  was detected predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus . the integrity of the deletion mutant was confirmed with the western blot assay . some immunoreactive Δn <dig> was detected in the mitochondrial fraction in western blots  possibly reflecting a weak association of the fusion protein with the mitochondria. this is supported by the observation of the coincidence of the green fluorescence of the fusion protein with the red florescence of the mitotracker in some transfected cells .

subcellular localization of alternative rat gfg isoforms
in addition to the full-length rgfg, we have previously cloned and sequenced alternatively spliced transcripts encoding  <dig> kda  and ~ <dig> kda  isoforms of rgfg  <cit> . the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda rgfg isoforms contain the same mts at their n-termini. gfg-gfp fusion constructs of these two splice variants were generated  and their subcellular trafficking was determined in transiently transfected c <dig> cells. both rgfgΔ <dig> and rgfgΔ2/ <dig> were exclusively targeted to mitochondria, as were the deletion mutants gfgΔ2/c <dig> , rgfgΔnudix  and rgfgn <dig> . in contrast, three n-terminal deletion mutants rgfgc <dig>  rgfgc <dig> and rgfgc <dig>  were localized in the nuclei and cytoplasm, but not in mitochondria, indicating that the n-terminal mts is the only functional mitochondrial targeting signal in rat gfg. the deletion mutants rgfgc <dig> and rgfgc <dig> are structurally similar to rgfg isoforms predicted from the celera rat genome assembly database, consisting of the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids  and c-terminal  <dig> amino acids . the latter isoform has 82% identity with the human gfg isoform b , which we have previously shown to be nuclear and cytoplasmic in localization  <cit> .

discussion
in the present study we analyzed the expression and subcellular distribution of rgfg, the protein product of the rat fgf-as gene. our present analysis shows that fgf-as mrna expression is ubiquitous, although individual splice variants were differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. full-length rgfg was expressed in a limited set of tissues, and was not detectable in brain, lung, or heart. rgfgΔ <dig> and rgfg Δ2/ <dig> were more broadly expressed, and detectable in varing levels in all tissues examined. fgf- <dig> and fgf-as mrnas were co-expressed, and immunoreactivity of their protein products were co-localized in some but not all tissues examined. there was no obvious association between the levels of expression of the sense and antisense mrnas or proteins in these tissues.

unlike the human gfg isoforms, all three of the previously characterized rgfg isoforms contained mitochondrial targetting signal sequences, and were shown to be exclusively targetted to mitochondria. the divergent n-terminal amino acid sequences of rat and human gfg indicate that the physicochemical properties of the mts, rather than the specific amino acid sequence, determines mitochondrial targeting  <cit> . the primary structures of the human and rat gfg targeting sequences predict amphiphilic helices consisting largely of hydrophobic residues. following mitochondrial import, the mts is generally cleaved by mitochondrial processing peptidases  <cit> , and the sizes of gfg:gfp fusion mutants observed in fig.  <dig> are consistent with mts cleavage. these results also indicate that the gfp fusion did not affect the structural conformation of the mts  <cit> .

we previously reported that human hgfg isoforms b and c, which lack the n-terminal mts, are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, consistent with the detection of gfg immunoreactivity in these compartments in various primary human tissues  <cit> . our present results indicate that rgfg, and the Δ <dig> and Δ2/ <dig> isoforms are exclusively targeted into mitochondria. however, immunohistochemistry and sub-cellular fractionation studies identified cytoplasmic and nuclear gfg immunoreactivity in rat tissues and cell lines  <cit> . this suggests that additional rat gfg isoform, corresponding to hgfgb and/or hgfgc, remain to be identified. indeed, the celera rat genome assembly predicts a gfg isoform  with > 80% amino acid identity to human gfgb, and lacking the n-terminal mts sequence. in the present study we confirmed that a deletion mutant of rgfg , corresponding to the predicted sequence of rgfgc, is indeed localized in cytoplasm and nuclei of transiently transfected cells , consistent with the behaviour of the corresponding human homolog, hgfgb. expression of rgfgc may account for previous reports of nuclear gfg immunoreactivity in some tissues. alternatively, tissue-specific posttranslational modification of rgfg may result in removal or inactivation of the mts  <cit> . the n-termini of rat and mouse gfg  contain a consensus monobasic prohomone cleavage site . this raises the possibility that, in some tissues, post-translational processing by prohormone convertases may remove the mts, resulting in cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of rgfg. prohormone convertase cleavage has previously been reported to mediate subcellular sorting of vgf  <cit> .

the physiological substrate of gfg has not yet been identified. although a plant homolog of gfg has recently been reported to have activity against adp-ribose and nadph  <cit> , preliminary enzymatic analysis of gfg has failed to identify any typical nudix-like pyrophosphatase activity against a variety of substrates nor any mutt-complementation activity with rat or human gfg isoforms  <cit> . in contrast, expression and translation of fgf- <dig> and gfg are tightly linked  <cit> , and dysregulation of their expression is associated with poor clinical prognosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that overexpression of gfg suppresses fgf- <dig> and inhibits cell proliferation in rat and human tumor cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, the inhibition of cell cycle progression is reversible by addition of exogenous fgf- <dig> indicating that the phenotypic effects of gfg are directly attributable to its effects on fgf- <dig> expression  <cit> . this interpretation is supported by our demonstration that a gfg deletion mutant lacking the enzymatic nudix domain is as effective as the full length protein in suppressing cell cycle progression  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, fgf antisense gene encodes a highly conserved nudix motif protein present in all multicellular organisms. alternative splicing of the primary transcript in animals  results in multiple isoforms of the protein differentially targeted to mitochondria, cytoplasm and nucleus. however, biochemical and functional assays suggest that the primary function of fgf-as is as a regulatory rna controlling fgf- <dig> expression. the high level of fgf-as sequence conservation in animal sequences suggests that this gene has been conserved to maintain its unique role in the regulation of fgf- <dig> expression.
