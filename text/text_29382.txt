BACKGROUND
evolutionary theory predicts that mutational decay is inevitable for small asexual populations, provided deleterious mutation rates are high enough. such populations are expected to experience the effects of muller's ratchet  <cit>  where the most-fit class of individuals is lost at some rate due to chance alone, leaving the second-best class to ultimately suffer the same fate, and so on, leading to a gradual decline in mean fitness. the mutational meltdown theory  <cit>  built upon muller's ratchet to predict a synergism between mutation and genetic drift in promoting the extinction of small asexual populations that are at the end of a long genomic decay process. regardless of reproductive mode, mitochondrial genomes from most animal species are expected to be particularly sensitive to muller's ratchet due to their uniparental inheritance, high mutation rates and lack of effective recombination  <cit> . the genomic decay effects of muller's ratchet have been observed in laboratory evolution experiments with abiotic rna molecules  <cit> , biotic rna viruses  <cit> , bacteria  <cit>  and yeast  <cit> . indirect evidence for the effects of muller's ratchet in nature has resulted from studies on the long-term effects of reduced population sizes on genetic diversity and fitness in amphibians  <cit> , greater prairie chickens  <cit>  and new zealand avifauna  <cit> . molecular evidence for muller's ratchet has resulted from analyses of deleterious trna gene structures encoded by mitochondrial genomes  <cit>  and analyses of drosophila sex chromosome evolution  <cit> . however, direct knowledge on the susceptibilities of natural populations to muller's ratchet and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain enigmatic.

caenorhabditis briggsae, like caenorhabditis elegans, is a self-reproducing hermaphroditic nematode species that also produces males capable of outcrossing with hermaphrodites. analyses of linkage disequilibrium patterns in c. briggsae natural isolates suggest a very low outcrossing rate of ~ <dig>  × 10- <dig>  <cit> . the same study reported population subdivision between c. briggsae strains collected in temperate localities versus those from tropical regions and nuclear silent-site nucleotide diversity  for the tropical isolates was estimated at  <dig>  × 10- <dig> – a number highly similar to global estimates for c. elegans  <cit> . the c. briggsae isolates from temperate localities, however, showed a remarkably lower mean πs value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  a direct estimate of the neutral base substitution mutation rate  is available from c. elegans mutation-accumulation lines  <cit>  that can be used along with πs data to estimate the effective population size   <cit> . assuming a common mutation rate between c. elegans and c. briggsae, ne is estimated to be ~ <dig>  for c. briggsae tropical isolates. for the c. briggsae temperate isolates, a much smaller ne of ~ <dig>  is estimated. based on these and other observations, it is hypothesized that c. briggsae only recently  colonized temperate latitudes from small founding populations  <cit> . furthermore, there is evidence for a ~2-fold elevated mutation rate in c. briggsae as compared to c. elegans  <cit>  that leads to correspondingly lower ne estimates for c. briggsae: ~ <dig>  for tropical populations and ~ <dig> for temperate populations. the combination of very low outcrossing rates, small ne and high mutation rates are expected to render c. briggsae natural mitochondrial lineages susceptible to the effects of muller's ratchet-associated deleterious mutation accumulation.

to probe for the effects of muller's ratchet in c. briggsae natural populations, we sequenced nearly complete mitochondrial genomes from multiple geographically diverse c. briggsae natural isolates and characterized molecular evolutionary processes by comparing nucleotide diversity patterns in mitochondrial dna  protein-coding genes between the temperate- and tropical-clade c. briggsae isolates, characterizing heteroplasmic genome deletions using quantitative real-time pcr  approaches and evaluating correlations of various natural mitochondrial genome haplotypes with nematode fecundity and fitness.

RESULTS
noncoding dna accumulation in caenorhabditis mitochondrial genomes
to search for natural mutational decay in c. briggsae, we analyzed nearly complete mitochondrial genome sequences  from  <dig> geographically diverse c. briggsae natural isolates . mtdna sequences were amplified as four overlapping long pcr products  that were directly sequenced using a combination of pcr and internal sequencing primers . a complete mitochondrial genome sequence for c. briggsae isolate af <dig> is available from genbank  and was used as a reference for primer design. the mitochondrial genome at-region constituted the only mtdna segment not analyzed in the c. briggsae natural isolates – as with c. elegans  <cit> , efforts to sequence through this highly at-rich region proved unsuccessful. each isolate was found to encode a unique mitochondrial genome haplotype.

strain bw <dig>  has historically been known as a nematode in the genus panagrolaimus; nuclear ribosomal dna and mtdna sequencing carried out in the denver lab, involving strains obtained from three different sources, agree that this isolate is instead a strain of c. briggsae. eg4207a was established from a single nematode picked from eg <dig> that constituted a c. briggsae lab population initially established from many nematodes. for clade, te indicates the temperate intraspecific clade, tr the tropical clade and ke the kenya clade. fecundity shows the mean numbers of progeny produced for each isolate  and the s. e. m. is shown in parentheses.

we discovered that most c. briggsae mitochondrial genomes harbor two presumed noncoding regions that are homologous to and likely derive from the nadh dehydrogenase  <dig>  protein-coding gene. the first nd5-like element  was identified between two trna genes, whereas the second larger element  resides between the nd <dig> and nd <dig> protein-coding genes . ψnd5- <dig> and ψnd5- <dig> display  <dig> % and  <dig> % sequence identity, respectively, to homologous regions of the c. briggsae nd <dig> gene. there is  <dig> % sequence identity between ψnd5- <dig> and ψnd5- <dig>  we subjected the ψnd5- <dig> and ψnd5- <dig> sequences to conceptual translation using the appropriate genetic code in mega <dig>  <cit>  to discover the presence of numerous internal stop codons, suggesting that these elements do not encode functional protein products. whereas all  <dig> c. briggsae mtdna sequences analyzed were found to harbor ψnd5- <dig>  only 22/ <dig> isolates harbored ψnd5- <dig> – this element was missing from the two kenya isolate  mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . although the mitochondrial genomes of c. elegans and c. remanei were found not to encode ψnd <dig> elements, that of caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig> , a recently-identified gonochoristic sister species to c. briggsae  <cit> , was discovered to encode a divergent form of ψnd5- <dig> .

to investigate the evolutionary relationships of c. briggsae natural isolate hermaphrodite lineages and the origins of ψnd5- <dig> and ψnd5- <dig>  we subjected the mtdna sequences to phylogenetic analyses using mega <dig>  <cit> . mitochondrial genome sequences from c. elegans , caenorhabditis remanei  and caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig>  were used as outgroups. all mtdna sequences were used for phylogenetic analyses, with the exception of ψnd5- <dig> and ψnd5- <dig> regions since determining their origins was one aim of the phylogenetic studies. maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining analyses yielded trees with identical topologies. the phylogenies revealed the presence of three major, well-supported intraspecific c. briggsae clades that we refer to as the temperate, tropical and kenya clades . the temperate and tropical clades form a monophyletic superclade, referred to as the global superclade, to the exclusion of the divergent kenya clade. the phylogenetic distributions of isolates into these clades are highly congruent with previous phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear intron and protein-coding gene sequences  <cit> . the absence of ψnd5- <dig> in the mitochondrial genomes of the two kenya clade c. briggsae isolates and other caenorhabditis species suggests that this element originated in the lineage leading to the c. briggsae global superclade. the presence of ψnd5- <dig> in all c. briggsae isolates and caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig>  but not other caenorhabditis species, suggests that this element originated in the common ancestor of c. briggsae and caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig> .

with the exception of the at-region, the vast majority of other animal mitochondrial genomes examined are devoid of similar extensive stretches of noncoding dna  <cit> . based on a recent population-genetic theory on the evolution of genome complexity  <cit>  that predicts higher noncoding dna accumulation probabilities in species of small population size due to a magnified power of genetic drift, the accumulation and persistence of ψnd <dig> elements in c. briggsae mitochondrial genomes is consistent with the hypothesis that natural c. briggsae lineages experience very small population sizes that are essential for genomic decay associated with muller's ratchet. ψnd5- <dig>  however, occurs in both c. briggsae and the obligately outcrossing species caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig>  the ψnd5- <dig> element might have accumulated in the  ancestor of c. briggsae and caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig> as a consequence of muller's ratchet since nematode mtdna is inherited through the hermaphrodite/female lineage and is not known to undergo intergenomic recombination. only two natural isolates from china are presently known and available caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig>  <cit> ; thus, we are presently unable to effectively characterize the population-genetic environment in which caenorhabditis sp. n.  <dig> evolves. future comparative analyses of ψnd5- <dig> molecular evolution between these two species, however, might provide important insights into the role of outcrossing in eliminating deleterious mutations from natural populations.

heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions
upon further analyzing the ψnd5- <dig> region in the c. briggsae natural isolates, we found that some strains harbor a large heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletion  that eliminated the 3' end of ψnd5- <dig> and the 5' end  of the nd <dig> protein-coding gene . directly repeated dna sequence tracts in nd <dig> and the upstream ψnd5- <dig> element flank the heteroplasmic nd <dig> deletion allele and are likely to play a causative role in promoting the deletions as direct repeats are also associated with heteroplasmic mitochondrial dna deletions in c. elegans mutation-accumulations lines  <cit>  and aging nematodes  <cit> . the observed deletion is expected to strongly and negatively affect nd <dig> protein-coding function as the deleted sequences encode more than  <dig> nd <dig> amino acids,  <dig> of which are conserved in c. elegans, drosophila melanogaster and humans. the ψnd5- <dig> region and associated heteroplasmic nd <dig> gene deletion was initially discovered in long pcr amplifications of c. briggsae natural isolate mitochondrial genome segments. the observation of the heteroplasmic deletion allele across multiple independent long pcr reactions  that span many mtdna genes provides strong evidence that the deletion is not a nuclear sequence of mitochondrial origin , but rather a heteroplasmic mtdna allelic variant. furthermore, we have searched for the deletion-bearing sequences in the published c. briggsae nuclear genome sequence and found no evidence for the presence of a candidate numt. we also found no evidence for heteroplasmic deletions associated with ψnd5- <dig> 

to better understand the relative abundances of nd <dig> deletion-bearing and intact mitochondrial genomes among c. briggsae natural isolates, we applied both conventional pcr and qpcr approaches. although initial exploratory studies used bulk dna extracts from large mixed-stage cultures, our assays were ultimately applied to genomic dna samples derived from individual l1-stage  nematodes – four independent individuals were assayed per isolate. initial conventional pcr assays employed a forward primer in the nd <dig> gene  and a reverse primer in nd <dig> sequences downstream of the heteroplasmic deletion – genomic dna samples from most global superclade c. briggsae isolates yielded one or two pcr products, one being ~ <dig> bp  and a second that is ~ <dig> bp  – see figure 3a. dna samples from the two isolates from kenya  produced single amplicons of intermediate size, as expected. this pcr reaction was carried out for four independent single-worm genomic dna samples from each of the  <dig> global-clade c. briggsae natural isolates analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis; gel banding patterns were scored to evaluate heteroplasmy patterns in their mitochondrial genomes. in particular, gels were scored on the basis of whether amplified products resulted from intact genomes only, deletion-bearing genomes only, or from both intact and deletion-bearing genomes. substantial pcr product banding pattern variation was observed  – among the  <dig> individual worms assayed,  <dig> produced only amplicons from intact genomes,  <dig> yielded amplicons from both intact and deletion-bearing genomes and  <dig>  exclusively produced amplicons from deletion-bearing genomes.

although the conventional pcr approach suggested extensive among-isolate variation in deletion heteroplasmy levels, a qpcr approach was applied to provide a more quantitative characterization of variation in the proportion of nd <dig> deletion-bearing genomes to the total among the isolates. qpcrs were carried out using the same genomic dna samples that were used for the conventional pcr assays . one set of qpcr primers amplified a nd <dig> region present only in intact genomes  and a second amplified a 16s rrna region present in both deletion-bearing and intact genomes for which there is no evidence of heteroplasmy . the nematode-specific proportions of genomes bearing nd <dig> deletions were calculated by dividing the estimated abundance of intact genomes by that of the total mitochondrial genomes, and then subtracting that number from one. estimated deletion-bearing genome proportions from qpcr results correlated positively with conventional pcr band scoring data  and revealed substantial among-isolate variation in nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy levels . nd <dig> deletion-bearing genomes were observed to accumulate in both the temperate and tropical intraspecific c. briggsae clades. two isolates  showed remarkably high deletion genotype proportions greater than 40%. interestingly, these two isolates were collected from islands  where populations might have been recently established from very small populations where drift is expected to play a particularly dominant role  <cit> . however, other island isolates  displayed low deletion proportions. although it cannot be ruled out that changes in heteroplasmy levels occurred while nematodes were maintained in laboratory culture after collection from nature, most  of the c. briggsae isolates considered here constitute strains recently collected from the wild  <cit>  that did not spend substantial time in laboratory culture before being stored as cryogenically-preserved frozen stocks. although similar heteroplasmic mitochondrial genome deletions have been observed in laboratory-bottlenecked c. elegans mutation-accumulation lines  <cit>  and are associated with rare mitochondrial myopathies in humans  <cit> , the widespread occurrence and persistence of such deleterious mitochondrial gene deletions in natural populations is unprecedented.

to investigate the potential effects of deletion-bearing molecules on organismal fitness, we next assayed variation in lifetime fecundity in the c. briggsae natural isolates. the mean fecundity observed across all  <dig> c. briggsae isolates assayed was  <dig>  progeny, a number remarkably smaller than that for c. elegans , but consistent with previously-reported fitness disparities between these two species  <cit> . a significantly negative correlation  was observed for isolate-specific deletion genotype proportions and nematode fecundities. furthermore, the two isolates with the highest mean fecundity values were the two from the kenya clade  that do not encode ψnd5- <dig> or experience associated nd <dig> deletion events. these observations suggest that the accumulation of deletion-bearing mitochondrial genomes might strongly and negatively affect fitness in c. briggsae natural populations. the present study, however, is unable to disentangle the fitness effects of mitochondrial and nuclear loci – it is possible that there exist deleterious nuclear loci that are responsible for reduced fitness in these lines rather than the high deletion levels. we expected to observe higher nd <dig> deletion proportions in the temperate-clade c. briggsae isolates as compared to those of the tropical clade as a consequence of reduced efficiency of natural selection associated with smaller ne estimates in the former group. however, no significant differences in nd <dig> deletion heteroplasmy levels were observed between these two groups .

accumulation of putative ψnd5- <dig> compensatory mutations
the heteroplasmic nd <dig> deletion observed in the c. briggsae natural isolates is flanked by directly repeated dna sequence stretches in homologous regions of ψnd5- <dig> and nd <dig> – one repeat copy remains in deletion-bearing genomes. we characterized patterns of sequence divergence at the  <dig> bp of directly repeated dna sequence in the c. briggsae isolates and discovered the presence of three different haplotype sequences for the repeat unit present in ψnd5- <dig> ; all isolates had identical sequences at the nd <dig> repeat unit. for the ψnd5- <dig> repeat unit, the majority of isolates encoded an ancestral sequence  that was identical to that present downstream in nd <dig>  in the temperate clade, however, two divergent derived haplotype sequences were observed in the ψnd5- <dig> direct repeat , each containing two sequence differences relative to the downstream nd <dig> repeat, that are expected to render the isolates encoding these divergent sequences less susceptible to direct repeat-associated intragenomic deletion events as compared to the drseq <dig> repeat unit. consistent with this expectation, isolates that encode drseq <dig> display significantly lower nd <dig> deletion proportions as compared to those that encode drseq <dig>  – see figure 4b. isolates encoding drseq <dig> also show lower nd <dig> deletion levels, though the difference as compared to those that encode drseq <dig> is not significant . when considered as groups, mean heteroplasmic deletion levels were higher in tropical-clade isolates  as compared to temperate-clade isolates , though the difference was not significant . we also analyzed fecundity variation with respect to the three sequence motifs and found that isolates encoding drseq <dig> displayed significantly elevated fecundity as compared to those encoding drseq <dig>  – see figure 4c. fecundities in isolates encoding drseq <dig> and drseq <dig>  however, were highly similar and not significantly different . the relatively low nd <dig> deletion proportions and high fecundities associated with isolates encoding drseq <dig> are suggestive of compensatory mutation – in particular, the ψnd5- <dig> substitutions are expected to result in reduced interactions of directly repeated sequences in ψnd5- <dig> and nd <dig>  thereby resulting in lower nd <dig> deletion incidences and higher fitness. however, we are again unable to account for the potential effects of nuclear loci.

these ψnd5- <dig> substitutions that likely promote reduced nd <dig> deletion proportions  are observed in the c. briggsae intraspecific temperate clade where ne estimates are much lower than that of the tropical clade  <cit>  and, thus, natural selection for compensatory mutations is expected to be less efficient. all tropical clade isolates analyzed encode drseq <dig>  however, recent work in phage mutation-accumulation experiments suggests an increase in the relative incidence of beneficial mutations as fitness decreases in association with deleterious mutation accumulation  <cit> . our results provide empirical support for this hypothesis in natural animal populations – any mutations in ψnd5- <dig> that result in reduced incidences of direct repeat-induced nd <dig> deletion events are expected to be advantageous. we propose that the occurrence of one highly deleterious mutational event  presents a novel mutational target in the mitochondrial genome where most all new mutations are expected to reduce homology between ψnd5- <dig> and nd <dig>  thus reducing the likelihood of deleterious mitochondrial genome deletions. consequently, such new mutations that result in increased divergence between ψnd5- <dig> and nd <dig> can be characterized as advantageous compensatory mutations. the fact that these candidate compensatory mutations were observed in the temperate clade  and not the tropical clade  is puzzling. although the evolutionary causes of these putative compensatory mutations in the temperate clade remains mysterious, it is possible that the heteroplasmic deletions are more deleterious in the temperate clade as compared to the tropical clade and that there is a corresponding difference in the selection coefficients associated with the candidate compensatory changes observed in the temperate isolates. another  possibility is that the increased fixation probability of these mutations in smaller populations  outweighs the higher population mutation rate experienced by larger populations . finally, it is possible that the ne estimates based on nuclear nucleotide diversity data do not accurately reflect the current population-genetic environments experienced by these two intraspecific clades.

after discovery of these putative compensatory mutations, we again searched for elevated nd <dig> deletion levels in the temperate as compared to the tropical isolates, this time including only those temperate-clade isolates that encode drseq <dig>  although the estimated nd <dig> deletion levels were on average greater in drseq1-encoding temperate isolates  versus that of the tropical isolates , the difference was not significant . fecundities were also highly similar  and not significantly different . unfortunately, only three of the analyzed temperate-clade isolates encode drseq <dig> , thereby severely limiting our power to detect differences in the propensities of these two intraspecific clades of different ne estimates to accumulate deleterious nd <dig> deletions. future efforts surveying a greater number of c. briggsae natural isolates will be required to further probe for the differential effects of muller's ratchet between these two clades at this locus.

nonsynonymous substitution accumulation in protein-coding genes
in addition to investigating the evolutionary dynamics of the unusual ψnd <dig> elements, the nearly complete c. briggsae mitochondrial genome sequences also offer the opportunity to analyze molecular evolution in the rest of the genome and, in particular, the twelve mtdna protein-coding genes. the relative efficiency of natural selection in preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations is often quantified by considering the relative rates of fixed nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes  <cit> . we applied a similar approach to probe for differences between the temperate-  and tropical-clade  c. briggsae isolates in their propensities for accumulating nonsynonymous substitutions. however, because we are comparing non-fixed nucleotide polymorphism patterns between two intraspecific lineages, we applied the ratio of nucleotide diversity at nonsynonymous sites  to that at synonymous sites  as a measure of relative susceptibilities to  deleterious nonsynonymous mutation accumulation, using dnasp  <cit> . for ten individual mtdna protein-coding genes, πn/πs values were compared between isolates of the c. briggsae temperate clade to those of the c. briggsae tropical clade. a concatenated data set including codons from all mtdna protein-coding genes was also analyzed and further compared to a comparable data set from  <dig> c. elegans natural isolates where there is no evidence of global phylogeographic population structure  <cit> .

we found that the πn/πs ratio was greater in the temperate-clade isolates as compared to the tropical-clade isolates for 8/ <dig> genes . for the concatenated gene datasets, the πn/πs ratio was higher in the temperate-clade c. briggsae isolates than that of the tropical-clade c. briggsae and c. elegans datasets. we attempted to apply meaningful confidence intervals on the πn and πs estimates using coalescent simulations in dnasp, however the small numbers of compared sequences  and low levels of nucleotide diversity  precluded our ability to do so. nonetheless, we observed dramatic magnitudinal differences in πn/πs ratios between the temperate- and tropical-clade c. briggsae isolates that suggest an increased susceptibility of temperate isolates to the accumulation of nonsynonymous substitutions. the πn/πs ratio was remarkably high for nd <dig> in the temperate isolates, being nearly equal to one. these observations suggest that c. briggsae temperate isolates are particularly susceptible to the accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the mitochondrial genome, consistent with expectations based on low ne in this intraspecific clade. the specific fitness effects of these nonsynonymous substitutions, however, remain enigmatic and it is possible that some fraction of them  might be advantageous in the context of the heteroplasmic nd <dig> deletion products.

CONCLUSIONS
the findings presented here show that in nature c. briggsae mitochondrial genomes are susceptible to the accumulation of unusual deleterious mutations that include the insertion of large noncoding dna stretches , function-disrupting heteroplasmic genome deletions  and nonsynonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes . this pattern of molecular evolution is consistent with strong roles for mutation and random genetic drift in shaping mitochondrial genome evolution in natural populations of this species. these observations, coupled with the strong potential negative impact of heteroplasmic nd <dig> deletions on organismal fitness, also suggest that c. briggsae mitochondrial genomes evolving in nature are vulnerable to the effects of muller's ratchet. although we did observe higher πn/πs ratios for protein-coding genes in the temperate  versus tropical  isolates, we were unable to detect a role for muller's ratchet in promoting higher deleterious nd <dig> deletion levels in the temperate clade. however, we also observed the accumulation of putative compensatory mutations  in temperate-clade c. briggsae lineages  that likely reduce nd <dig> deletion levels. the drseq <dig> mutations can only be considered beneficial, however, in the context of the preexisting deleterious ψnd5- <dig> insertion mutation – in fact, virtually any mutation in ψnd5- <dig> that reduces its homology to nd <dig> is likely to be beneficial to some extent.

comparative nematode mutation-accumulation studies show a significantly elevated deleterious genomic mutation rate in bottlenecked lines derived from c. briggsae versus c. elegans progenitors  <cit> . furthermore, an elevated deleterious mutation rate was estimated for c. briggsae hk104-derived lines  as compared to ma lines derived from the pb <dig> isolate that encodes drseq <dig>  the candidate compensatory mutation that likely reduced nd <dig> deletion product levels  <cit> . the protein product encoded by the nd <dig> gene, predicted to be highly impaired in nd <dig> deletion-bearing genome products, is a central core subunit of complex i of the mitochondrial electron transport chain  <cit> . complex i-compromised organisms in well-studied animal systems- mammals, d. melanogaster, and c. elegans  <cit>  – all produce elevated levels of mutagenic reactive oxygen species. thus, we predict that c. briggsae nd <dig> deletion products are mutagenic, and that expression of truncated nd <dig> protein products results in elevated reactive oxygen species levels. one intriguing hypothesis for the mutational disparities observed between c. elegans and c. briggsae, and between hk <dig> and pb <dig> , is that the elevated rates are due to increased mutagenic reactive oxygen species levels resulting from nd <dig> deletion products . this hypothesis also predicts that muller's ratchet can affect fundamental evolutionary parameters such as the mutation rate.
