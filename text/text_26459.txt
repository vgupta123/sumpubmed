BACKGROUND
protein-coding regions account for only about  <dig> % of the human genome  <cit> , but the fantom consortium and the encode project consortium revealed that more than 62% of the genomic dna acts as a template for transcription  <cit> , indicating that there are a large number of non-coding rnas  in living cells. recently, many functional ncrnas have been identified. it is well known that small rnas, such as mirnas and pirnas, act in post-transcriptional regulation by forming rna-rna duplexes  <cit> . in addition to these rnas, many kinds of long ncrnas have been shown to function in post-transcriptional regulation, such as rna editing, splicing and translation, by forming rna-rna duplexes  <cit> . indeed,  <dig>  sense-antisense transcript  pairs in mice have the potential to form rna-rna duplexes  <cit> . rna-rna duplexes also play a role in transcriptional gene silencing through dna methylation and histone modifications  <cit> . thus, it is clear that the formation of rna-rna duplexes is important for the mrna silencing triggered by ncrna.

however, several studies have reported that some long ncrnas cause transcriptional activation of genes without forming rna-rna duplexes. for example, hottip, a long intergenic ncrna  transcribed from the 5’-end of the hoxa locus, binds to an adaptor protein, wd repeat-containing protein  <dig> , which in turn recruits the mixed-lineage leukaemia  histone methyltransferase complex  <cit> . with the help of hottip-wdr5-mll <dig> interaction, several distantly located target genes are brought into close contact through tertiary structure formation, resulting in trimethylation of histone h3k <dig> and gene activation. moreover, a recent study showed that dbe-t, a chromatin-associated ncrna, is selectively transcribed from the chromosome 4q <dig> region in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients and coordinates the transcription of 4q <dig> genes  <cit> . dbe-t recruits the trithorax group protein ash1l, a histone-lysine n-methyltransferase, to the dna template for dbe-t, driving histone h3k <dig> dimethylation and 4q <dig> gene transcription. therefore, lncrnas acting together with chromosomal proteins are thought to regulate gene functions in an rna-rna hybridization-independent manner. however, in contrast to small rnas, there are few reports about the functional properties of single-strand ncrnas that act without forming rna-rna duplexes.

in mammals, cpg islands  in promoter regions tend to show bidirectional promoter activity  <cit> . cgis are utilized for bidirectional transcription in a head-to-head  manner. our previous reports have shown that, in contradiction to the prevalent idea that ncrnas other than classical ncrnas  downregulate target gene expression, antisense long ncrnas derived from promoter regions of their respective protein-coding genes activate the expression of those genes via sequence-specific dna demethylation  <cit> . we termed these antisense long  ncrnas “promoter-associated ncrnas” . at present, little is known about the concerted expression of mrnas and antisense transcripts produced in their 5’-flanking regions, and comprehensive transcriptome analysis focusing on the bidirectional transcription of mrna and pancrna has not been performed. we do not yet know the sequence characteristics of bidirectionally transcribed promoter regions. here, we examine whether there is a correlation between the expression of sense and antisense transcripts at the genome-wide level using directional rna-seq. we map the origin of the sense and antisense transcripts found by directional rna-seq to determine the prevalence of hth transcript pairs from cgi promoters. we propose that highly expressed antisense transcripts derived from bidirectional transcription start sites  show coordinated transcription with the corresponding protein-coding genes.

RESULTS
both top and bottom strands are utilized in a small fraction of the genome
we analyzed directional rna-seq data in order to distinguish sense and antisense transcripts in the mouse cerebral cortex, cerebellum and heart, and in the chimpanzee cerebral cortex and cerebellum . on average, we obtained  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million reads per sample from the first and second runs of illumina hiseq  <dig>  respectively . the average number of reads passing the read trimming was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  million for the first and second runs, respectively. we mapped the valid reads onto the reference genome sequences using tophat . we used the human instead of the chimpanzee genome as a reference for the chimpanzee reads . the average percentage of uniquely mapped reads in the valid reads was  <dig> % for the mouse cerebral cortex,  <dig> % for the mouse cerebellum,  <dig> % for the mouse heart,  <dig> % for the chimpanzee cerebral cortex and  <dig> % for the chimpanzee cerebellum . after we removed duplicate sequences, the average number of uniquely mapped reads in two replicates of each tissue sample was  <dig>  million reads for the mouse cerebral cortex,  <dig>  million reads for the mouse cerebellum,  <dig>  million reads for the mouse heart,  <dig>  million reads for the chimpanzee cerebral cortex and  <dig>  million reads for the chimpanzee cerebellum. removal of duplicated reads smoothed the unexpected protruding clusters of reads, possibly derived from pcr bias during library preparation, as shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  the average ratio of top strand-mapped reads to bottom strand-mapped reads in a sample was  <dig>  . we confirmed that candidate pancrnas at pacsin <dig> and kcnmb <dig>  were transcribed from the opposite dna strand compared to their mrnas, as expected, using strand-specific rt-pcr . although we did not confirm the functionality of the candidate pancrnas, we refer to these transcripts as a fraction of ncrnas based on their lower coding potential as explained later . the results of the rt-pcr analysis support the validity of our directional rna-seq analyses. then, we calculated the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads  of protein-coding genes in the two replicates in order to confirm the reproducibility of our analysis. the kendall’s tau correlation between the two replicates of each tissue sample was >  <dig>  . therefore, we merged the data from these two replicates for all samples and used them for the following analyses.

in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and heart, the transcribed regions for polya+ rna were found to account for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mouse genome, respectively . next, we examined how many genomic regions were utilized for both sense and antisense transcription. overlapping transcription for polya+ rnas was found in only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the mouse genome in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and heart, respectively . a similar transcriptional landscape was found when chimpanzee samples were analyzed .

we calculated the ratio of top strand-mapped reads to bottom strand-mapped reads in the bidirectionally transcribed regions . the results showed that, even if the regions are bidirectionally transcribed, most of the regions show a biased expression pattern in terms of directional transcription. the mapping information in the bidirectionally transcribed regions was subgrouped into top strand, bottom strand and intergenic regions of mouse genes . significantly large fractions of the top strand- and bottom strand-mapped reads were thereby confirmed to be associated with the top and bottom strands of mouse genes, respectively. in intergenic regions, we also found biased transcription in terms of the directionality. similarly, biased transcription was also found when chimpanzee samples were analyzed .

taken together, these data showed that strand bias of transcription occurred on a genome-wide level. either top or bottom strand was preferentially utilized depending on the tissue.

genome-wide production of ncrnas that do not form rna-rna duplexes
our previous studies demonstrated that antisense transcripts from promoter regions could activate the sense transcription of the same locus  <cit> . hence, we analyzed hth transcript pairs, rather than overlapping transcription. in order to examine the switching-point of the bi-transcriptional direction, we focused on the genomic regions around tsss of the reference genes. first, we adjusted the tss of each reference gene according to the mapped reads of each tissue sample . this adjustment is important for determining the precise distribution of mapped reads around tsss. in fact, the encode project showed that approximately 48% of the cage-identified tsss are located hundreds of base pairs away from annotated gencode tsss, indicating the requirement for this adjustment of tsss  <cit> . then, we examined the distribution of sense and antisense mapped reads around the tss of each mouse protein-coding gene . in order to focus on the ncrna-expressing promoters, we removed the hth-type promoters driving protein-coding gene expression in both directions from our datasets. we examined the longest open reading frame  in each region between + <dig> and + <dig>  bp and those between − <dig> and −1 bp relative to the tss, respectively. the mean length of the longest orfs in the upstream and downstream regions is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, in the mouse dataset. in the chimpanzee dataset, the mean length of the longest orfs in the upstream and downstream regions is  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. next, we examined the distribution of the longest orf size in the mouse and chimpanzee dataset . there is one peak around  <dig> nt for the upstream region. on the other hand, there are two peaks around  <dig> and  <dig> nt for the downstream region. the 900-nt-peak seemed to reflect the fraction consisting of protein-coding genes. moreover, we examined whether regions between − <dig>  and −1 bp relative to the tss contained any conserved protein domains by using ncbi’s conserved domain database  <cit> . only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all regions from − <dig> to − <dig>  bp relative to the tss contain any conserved protein domains in the mouse and chimpanzee dataset, respectively. in contrast,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all regions from + <dig> to + <dig>  bp relative to the tss contain conserved protein domains in the mouse and chimpanzee dataset, respectively. these results suggest that the vast majority of the upstream regions in our datasets produced ncrnas, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that a fraction of these antisense transcripts encode very short proteins.

in order to investigate if antisense transcription occurs in conjunction with transcription of the corresponding mrna, we examined the distribution of sense and antisense mapped reads around the tsss of mouse genes. toward this end, we selected the  <dig> genes with the most-highly expressed pancrnas and the  <dig> genes with the most-weakly expressed pancrnas, as indicated by rpkm . in this selection, we did not consider mrna expression level for the selection of genes. for the rpkm calculation of the pancrnas, only antisense mapped reads in the upstream region of protein-coding genes were counted. for estimation of the promoter activity of protein-coding genes, we focused on the region between + <dig> and + <dig>  bp relative to the tsss. both in the mouse and chimpanzee samples, more sense reads were mapped to the protein-coding genes with pancrnas showing the top  <dig> ranked rpkm than to those with pancrnas showing the bottom  <dig> ranked rpkm . when we calculated rpkm of the protein-coding genes based on the reference gene structure, we again found that the protein-coding genes with pancrnas showing the top  <dig> ranked rpkm were more highly expressed than those with pancrnas showing the bottom  <dig> ranked rpkm . from the  <dig> regions with the most-highly expressed pancrnas, we extracted three types of genomic regions: 1) the expression level of antisense transcript from the upstream region of the tss is at least five times higher than that from the downstream region, 2) the expression level of antisense transcript from the upstream region of the tss is at least two times lower than that from the downstream region, and 3) the remaining regions not meeting condition 1) or 2). then, we examined the distribution of sense and antisense mapped reads in each subgroup . although we cannot rule out a possible short association between ncrna and the corresponding mrna at their 5’-ends, rt-pcr detection of transcripts derived from pancrna-bearing gene loci pacsin <dig> and kcnmb <dig> supported the positive correlation between pancrna and mrna expression . we investigated two representative genes and confirmed that pancrna and mrna transcribed from the hth promoter regions did not overlap with each other, which is in consistent with our directional rna-seq data . therefore, it seemed likely that single-stranded ncrnas function to activate the expression of the corresponding mrnas via a mechanism independent of rna-rna duplex formation.

the values in this table are normalized by the number of genes.

athe genes with the top  <dig> ranked antisense rpkm in the upstream region of their tsss.

bthe values are divided into three groups. the genes whose antisense transcirpt expression level from the upstream region of the tss was five times higher than that from the downstream region . the genes whose antisense transcript expression level from the upstream region of the tss was two times lower than that from the downstream region . the remaining genes .

dthe genes with the top  <dig> ranked sense rpkms in the downstream region of their tsss.

ethe genes with the bottom  <dig> ranked antisense rpkms in the downstream region of their tsss.

when we selected the genes with the top and the bottom  <dig> ranked rpkm in the downstream region of their tsss, pancrnas were not always associated with these genes . it is likely that constitutively expressed genes are generally not associated with pancrna. these data suggested that highly expressed pancrnas transcribed from the upstream regions of tsss tended to be associated with the expression of the corresponding mrnas in a coordinated manner, but highly expressed mrnas were not always associated with the expression of pancrnas.

the tissue-specific expression of pancrnas showed a positive correlation with that of the corresponding mrnas
in the light of above observations, we thought it possible that pancrnas could activate the transcription of the corresponding mrnas in a tissue-specific manner. to test this possibility, we identified tissue-specific pancrna-bearing genes based on the rpkm value of the candidate pancrnas starting upstream of the tsss. we examined the distribution of sense and antisense mapped reads derived from the mouse cerebral cortex and heart samples around the tsss of the cerebral cortex- or heart-specific genes, respectively . the results showed that, for instance, for cerebral cortex-specific pancrna-bearing genes, more sense reads corresponding to mrnas derived from the cerebral cortex sample were mapped to the downstream of the tss than such sense reads those derived from the heart sample. the same held true for heart-specific pancrna-bearing genes. therefore, we concluded that the expression of pancrna was associated with the preferential upregulation of the corresponding mrna in a given tissue. basal mrna expression was detected to some extent without pancrna expression in the heart samples, and increased expression of the corresponding pancrna was associated with higher gene expression in the cerebral cortex, suggesting that the expression of pancrnas could enhance the corresponding mrna expression rather than triggering it. information on the comparison between cerebellum and heart is shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig>  and indicates a similar tendency of a positive correlation between pancrna and mrna expressions.

the values in this table were normalized by the number of genes. in this analysis, we defined a pancrna whose rpkm was higher than  <dig>  in one tissue and lower than  <dig>  in the other as a tissue-specific pancrna.

in order to support our hypothesis, we examined the function of three representative pancrna-bearing genes selected from the mouse cerebral cortex-specific pancrna-bearing genes, sh3rf <dig>  vwa5b <dig> and pacsin <dig>  we performed quantitative rt-pcr to detect the expression level of pancrna and the corresponding mrna in the mouse cortical neurons after pancrna knockdown as described in methods . as expected, knockdown of each pancrna  significantly decreased the expression of the corresponding mrna. these results suggest that pancrnas could enhance the corresponding mrna expression. furthermore, to show a direct link between the expression level of pancrnas and their corresponding mrnas in several cell types, we calculated sense and antisense rpkm in the downstream and upstream regions of the tsss, respectively, and examined the pearson correlation coefficient between the sense and antisense rpkm at these three gene loci in various tissues. for this analysis, we utilized processed data on mouse directional rna-seq of  <dig> different tissues and primary cells available from ncbi gene expression omnibus   <cit> . the average of these three correlation coefficients was  <dig>  . taken together, our results indicate that a fraction of pancrnas are expressed from the hth regions and support the notion that bidirectional promoter regions function in cis to regulate gene expression via pancrna production for setting up precise tissue-specific gene expression profiles.

sequence characteristics of pancrna-bearing genes
we hypothesized that the presence or absence of pancrna was attributable to the genomic dna information. to test this, first we used the gardiner-garden-frommer based cgis available from the ucsc table browser  <cit> . notably,  <dig> % of the candidate pancrna-bearing genes overlapped with cgis in the mouse . a bias for cgis was also found in chimpanzee samples . these results showed that the bidirectional promoter regions of protein-coding genes exhibited a strong bias for cgis, supporting the presence of genomic characteristics of pancrna-bearing gene promoter regions.

next we considered the possibility that a fraction of cgis may have signature sequences that direct pancrna expression. using the dataset of candidate pancrna-bearing genes, we performed de novo motif discovery. we found that in all of the mouse tissue samples examined, several ccg repeats were located between − <dig> and +100 bp . moreover, we found that in all of these tissues, several cgg repeats, complementary to the ccg repeats, were located in the downstream region starting from +100 bp. ccg and cgg repeats were overrepresented at similar genomic locations in chimpanzee samples .

the average repeat numbers of ccg and cgg were  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the maximum repeat numbers of ccg and cgg were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. then, to examine whether the distribution of ccg and cgg repeats was preferentially observed in the promoter regions of candidate pancrna-bearing genes, we calculated the observed frequency of “ccgccg” and “cggcgg” sequences across the regions around the tsss . like the observed consensus repeat sequences, both “ccgccg” and “cggcgg” sequences were significantly enriched in the promoter regions of candidate pancrna-bearing genes, reflecting the high rate of overlap of the promoter regions of candidate pancrna-bearing genes with cgis.

analysis using all promoter sequences also showed that the peaks of the distributions of these two six-base sequences occurred at a similar position relative to the tsss. in contrast, analysis using the promoter sequences of candidate pancrna-bearing genes showed that the peaks were located at different positions. to examine how many promoter regions harbor both of these repeat sequences, we calculated the percentage of the promoter regions with “ccgccg” and “cggcgg” sequences . we found that  <dig> % of candidate pancrna-bearing genes in the cerebral cortex harbored both sequences, whereas only  <dig> % of all promoter regions did.

taken together, these results showed that bidirectional transcription occurred frequently in promoter regions, and that such bidirectional promoter regions exhibited a bias toward gc-rich sequences, especially ccg and cgg repeats, potentially affecting the transcription of protein-coding genes with tissue-dependent expression.

discussion
assessment of directional rna-seq data
in our directional rna-seq analyses, the average percentages of uniquely and multiply mapped reads in the valid reads determined by using tophat were  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the mouse, and  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the chimpanzee, respectively . these mapping rates are compatible with those of rna sequencing analysis in the encode project, in which the average percentage of all mapped reads-pairs corresponding to total reads in polya+ rna sequencing is  <dig> %  <cit> . in our analysis, we used the human instead of the chimpanzee genome as a reference. on average,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the valid reads in directional rna-seq data of the chimpanzee cerebral cortex were uniquely mapped onto the chimpanzee and the human genome sequence, respectively, except for random chromosome sequences , validating the sequence similarity between the chimpanzee and the human genome. in fact, the number of transcripts with protein-coding gene biotype is much smaller in the chimpanzee database than in the human database.  <dig>  transcripts have been registered in the chimpanzee ensembl genes with protein-coding gene biotypes, whereas  <dig>  transcripts have been registered in the human ensembl genes with protein-coding gene biotypes. therefore, the massive annotation of the human transcripts enabled us to determine the transcription characteristics around the tsss of the protein-coding genes in the chimpanzee, as shown in additional file 2: figure s4i, m.

the valid reads in our directional rna-seq data of the mouse cerebral cortex samples covered  <dig> % of the mouse genome . those of the chimpanzee cerebral cortex samples covered  <dig> % of the human genome . comparable numbers were found by the encode project, showing that the average nucleotide coverage of the human genome in several cell types is about 20%  <cit> . therefore, taken together with the mapping quality, the rich reference data, and the reproducibility of our data, the sequencing depth of our datasets was high enough for comprehensive detection of the transcribed regions in the genome, as discussed below.

the importance of single-stranded ncrnas for gene regulations
the capacity of a ncrna to form a duplex with partially complementary rna is one of the criteria for classifying the properties of ncrnas. previous studies have indicated that the formation of rna-rna duplexes is important for post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . theoretically, ncrna-mrna duplex formation could decrease the gene expression level through both pre- and post-transcriptional regulation  <cit> . in contrast, single-stranded ncrnas generally regulate transcription in cooperation with chromatin modification factors , although their underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. our analyses suggested that pairs of sense and antisense transcripts expressed in a tissue were rather rare. only  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the genome was bidirectionally transcribed in the mouse cerebral cortex, cerebellum and heart, respectively . even in the bidirectionally transcribed regions, either the top or bottom strand was preferentially utilized . these features of the transcriptional landscape were seen in the chimpanzee tissue samples as well . thus, in mammals, there are a non-negligible number of single-stranded ncrnas that can function in a cell.

the transcriptional activation mediated by pancrnas in the bidirectional promoter regions
among single-stranded ncrnas, we focus on the ncrnas transcribed from mrna promoter regions. in this study using mouse and chimpanzee tissue samples, we showed that antisense ncrnas transcribed from promoter regions could be classified into two categories according to the location of their tsss relative to those of the corresponding mrnas . the first category is composed of antisense ncrnas overlapping with the corresponding mrnas. these antisense ncrnas can downregulate the corresponding mrnas, because such antisense ncrnas are known to downregulate the mrnas via the formation of ncrna-mrna duplexes  <cit> . for example, the expression level of the transcription factor pu. <dig> is downregulated by the antisense ncrna complementary to the mrna via the formation of an mrna-ncrna duplex  <cit> . the other category is composed of antisense ncrnas starting from regions upstream of the tsss of the corresponding mrnas, i.e., pancrnas. here, we showed a positive correlation between the expression of pancrnas and the corresponding mrnas, which is consistent with reports of transcriptional activation mediated by the overexpression of pancrnas that do not hybridize with the corresponding mrnas  <cit> . overexpression of khps <dig>  one such pancrna transcribed from the sphk <dig> gene region, causes demethylation of cpg sites in the promoter region of sphk <dig> to activate the transcription of sphk <dig> <cit> . in this study, we found that the expression of hundreds of pancrnas was accompanied by the expression of the corresponding mrnas in a tissue-specific manner . moreover, we showed that knockdown of cerebral cortex-specific pancrna significantly decreased the expression of the corresponding mrna in mouse neurons . therefore, we propose that, like some pancrnas that we have previously identified  <cit> , pancrnas could act as tissue-specific transcriptional facilitator of the expression of the corresponding mrnas via epigenetic mechanisms. recent data from the encode project are in accord with this idea: many lncrnas show a tissue-specific expression pattern that is positively correlated with that of the mrnas with which they share a single bidirectional promoter  <cit> . positive correlation between the expression of pancrnas and corresponding mrnas was seen in both the mouse and chimpanzee tissue samples , raising the possibility that the mode of regulation of mrna expression by pancrna is similar between mouse and chimpanzee.

we now think that many pancrnas exist and enhance mrna expression at the genome-wide level, but not all mrnas are under pancrna regulation, because the highly expressed mrnas were not associated with corresponding antisense ncrnas . this result also suggests that expression of mrnas may not enhance the corresponding pancrna expression. based on our data, lncrnas that function in setting up the chromatin structure can be subgrouped into at least three categories: 1) those containing rna domains that specifically interact with chromatin modifiers to modulate thousands of loci , 2) those functioning together with complementary rnas , and 3) those that act in cis to specifically set up active chromatin status in a sequence-specific manner .

abundant ccg and cgg repeats and cgis as hallmarks of pancrna-mediated gene regulation
in our genome-wide analysis, we examined the sequence characteristics important for the transcription of pancrnas. we found that more than 90% of candidate pancrna-bearing genes overlapped with cgis, and that ccg and cgg repeats appeared frequently around tsss of such genes in the mouse and chimpanzee tissue samples . since at least some pancrnas can induce dna demethylation of cpg sites in promoter regions  <cit> , there must be cpg sites in the promoter regions of such pancrna-bearing genes. therefore, it is logical to assume that pancrnas are preferentially derived from regulatory gc-rich sequences. notably, not all cgi promoter regions show bidirectional promoter activity. since we examined only three tissues, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and heart, in this study, it will be important to verify that cgi promoters in other tissues also act as pancrna-bearing gene promoters.

it is possible that there are some additional sequence characteristics important for the bidirectional transcription from pancrna-bearing promoter regions. it is interesting to note that there is a gap between the peak of the ccg and the cgg repeats . we consider that this gap probably plays a key role in the transcription of pancrnas. intriguingly, the regions with these characteristics are included in the gc-skewed regions where the distributions of guanines and cytosines are biased. it was reported that transcription through gc-skewed regions led to the formation of dna-dna-rna triple helix structures, termed r loop structures. r loop formation has been shown to protect against dna methylation  <cit> . therefore, we consider that gc skew results from the biased distribution of ccg and cgg repeats around tsss, and that a fraction of pancrnas may be involved in the formation of the dna-dna-rna triple helix structures during the process of dna demethylation. however, not all pancrna-bearing promoter regions contain both “ccgccg” and “cggcgg” sequences . one possible explanation for this fact is that there may be as yet unknown physical features of the dna sequences regarding how the distribution of guanines and cytosines affects strand asymmetry formation. although the mechanisms of dna demethylation induced by pancrna are currently unknown, identification of these two consensus repeats may provide a clue to unravel how pancrnas mediate transcriptional activation.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show here that a significant number of single-stranded ncrnas and pancrnas exist in a cell. our findings suggest that, in mammals, specific dna sequences regulate the expression of pancrnas, which enhance the expression level of the corresponding mrnas in a tissue-specific manner. the sequences enriched in pancrna-bearing genes, ccg and cgg repeats, may be important for the expression of pancrnas.
