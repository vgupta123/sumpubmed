BACKGROUND
adaptive immune antibody responses rely primarily on the interaction between t helper cell populations promoting b cell activation, isotype switching, and development of plasma cells producing immunoglobulin, with subsequent pathogen opsonization/viral neutralization . however, in t cell-deficiency settings such as aids, this td mode of antibody production is ineffective at conferring protection to the host. fortunately, “innate-like” b cells, which include splenic marginal zone b cells  and peritoneal b <dig> b cells , can become activated after recognition of repetitive or polymeric antigenic epitopes causing b cell receptor  clustering, independently of t helper  subset . efficient bcr clustering is crucial for the generation of a ti antibody response and in fact it has been determined that 10– <dig> bcrs must be crosslinked in order to mount a ti response  <cit> . on resting b cells, bcrs are spaced approximately 35 nm apart, requiring ti antigens to be at least 500 nm in length  <cit> . despite the chemical diversity of ti antigens, most ti antigens repetitive epitopes are spaced 5–10 nm  <cit> . once a ti b cell has become activated, its antibody response is largely characterized by the production of igm and certain igg isotypes . b <dig> b cells have also been found to undergo class switch recombination from igm to iga. although the anatomic site of this isotype switch remains elusive, this suggests that a significant proportion of iga may be generated in a ti manner  <cit> .

while many bacterial capsular polymeric components have been studied for their ability to stimulate a ti antibody response, it remained to be tested whether bacterial flagellin , a major antigen present on many commensal and pathogenic microbes, can be exploited as a scaffold for ti vaccines  <cit> . indeed, one study suggested that polymeric flagellin, like its monomeric form, relies on t cell help to stimulate a humoral immune response. however, this study did not include igm and igg <dig>  in their analysis  <cit> . flic from salmonella serovar enterica typhimurium  is the major protein making up the flagellum  and can grow to 15 μm in length  <cit> . in vitro studies revealed that flic is able to form filaments hundreds of nanometers in length  <cit> . this is a critical feature for the success of ti vaccines, as it has been suggested that a ti antigen needs to be at least 500 nm in length to produce a significant ti response.

flic is a four-domain  protein that structurally resembles the greek letter Γ , and has been well characterized for its adjuvant activity due to its toll-like receptor  <dig>  and nod-like receptor card domain-containing protein  <dig>  binding sites located in its d <dig> domain, a domain also responsible for polymerization . in polymerized flic filaments, the d <dig> domain of flic is completely solvent exposed, while other domains remain mostly buried within the inner core. moreover, based on the crystallographic structure of the filament the d <dig> domains are spaced ~5 nm apart. muskotal et al.  <cit>  found that as a monomer the d <dig> domain is the most stable portion of flic, where d <dig> and d <dig> completely lose their α-helical secondary structure, corroborating previous structural studies. moreover, by eliminating d <dig>  this study found that d <dig> was dispensable for the overall stability of the flagellum filament, marking d <dig> as a possible insertion site for novel antigenic determinants.fig.  <dig> design and analysis of hybrid flagellin protein. a schematic of the construction and design of hybrid flagellin . the d <dig> domain from the native flic protein was deleted . denv <dig> e plus gs linkers flanking the termini were inserted to replace the d <dig> domain of flic. the final gene product was cloned into the pentr plasmid for baculovirus expression of the hybrid protein. b protein expressed by baculovirus expression system was checked for purity and anticipated molecular weight  using both coomassie stain  and western blot . in the western blot, protein was probed with an antibody against the his-tag under denaturing conditions. major bands from both blots indicate appropriate band size, however some degradation products were present in coomassie gel; by densitometry the predicted hflic band comprised approximately 15 % of total protein. the double band in the western blot suggests a proteolytic cleavage very near the n-terminus. c circular dichroism  was used to assess secondary structural feature of the hflic protein. cd spectra of flic  exhibit a characteristic α-helical region, while denv <dig> spectra  exhibit a large β-sheet and coil regions. hflic cd spectra  was essentially a hybrid of the two proteins



the polymeric nature of flic filaments intrinsically provides the key feature needed for stimulating a potent ti response, so we wanted to test its ability as a vaccine scaffold for ti antigens. our approach was to test the flic d <dig> site for insertion of a fully independent conformational domain, and polymerizing the engineered protein as a vaccine target. we engineered native flic by replacing its entire d <dig> domain with the full length sequence of the envelope glycoprotein  from dengue virus serotype  <dig> , bridged by flexible linker sequences. this allowed for the antigen portion of the hybrid flic  protein to be fully exposed in polymerized filaments, enabling engagement of the antigen with the b cell antigen receptors for bcr crosslinking and subsequent ti stimulation. our studies showed that the hflic filaments were able to stimulate a potent antibody response; more importantly, the filament induced a significant response in a helper t cell-restricted mouse model. thus, the study presented herein describes the use of flic as a novel scaffold for the design of potential td/ti vaccines.

RESULTS
design and characterization of hflic protein
to take advantage of the solvent exposed location of the d <dig> domain of flic, we replaced this domain with a vaccine antigen domain, so that the surface of the polymerized hybrid protein filament would present polymeric vaccine antigen instead of flagellin epitopes. thus, the flagellin d <dig> domain from residues  <dig> to  <dig> were removed and replaced with the extracellular domain of the denv <dig> envelope protein . denv <dig> e is one of three structural proteins produced by the dengue  <dig> virus  and forms an icosahedral scaffold at the virion surface. denv <dig> e mediates the fusion of virus to host cells and as such has been extensively studied for its antigenicity as a denv <dig> vaccine  <cit> . in order to maintain the conformational independence of this domain, we added gly-ser flexible linkers to join flic to the n- and c- terminus of denv <dig> e. the resulting hybrid protein is therefore comprised of a central independent denv  <dig> e protein domain, flanked by the two independent n-and c- terminal helical domains of flic; folding of the e protein domain will help stabilize the helical domains of flic, although further stabilization occurs in the polymerized filament when interactions between helical domains of the monomers interact. finally, a c-terminal his6-tag was added for production and purification purposes. the hybrid flic protein  was produced using a baculovirus expression system, purified , and subsequently assayed for appropriate structure and function. after his-tag enrichment, the hflic band is clearly evident although comprising only about 14 % of total protein; western blot indicates a possible proteolytic cleavage near the n-terminus.

circular dichroism  was used to assess the secondary structure of purified hflic protein , and compared to that of free flic and denv <dig>  quantification of percent secondary structure from the cd spectra revealed that flic  was largely α-helical, meanwhile, denv <dig>  had a larger β-sheet region, consistent with previous published spectra, and was in good agreement with computationally determined secondary structure percentages based on crystallographic structures . the hybrid hflic exhibited a spectrum of mixed α-helical and β-sheet character . taken together these data suggest that whole protein antigens can be inserted into flic backbone without jeopardizing the native secondary structure of either protein.table  <dig> quantification of secondary structure from cd spectra

characterization of hflic filaments
a hypothetical molecular model of the hflic filament predicts an independent domain of denv e at the surface of an intact 11-protofilament polymer . accordingly, we determined that the hflic protein was able to form filaments in high molar ammonium sulfate or sodium citrate , similar to the reported molar conditions for in vitro wt flic polymerization  <cit> . to evaluate these filaments, we used negative stain transmission electron microscopy . morphometric analysis of the filaments revealed an increased diameter of 35 nm compared to wt flic filaments , consistent with the hypothetical molecular model of the hflic filament . however, we do not have sufficient resolution to confirm that the hflic forms the prototypical 11-protofilament core structure as suggested by the hypothetical molecular model.fig.  <dig> characterization of hybrid flagellin filaments. a the top panel represents molecular structure of the parent flic filament <dig> . negative stain te micrograph of wt flic filament generated by recombinantly produced flic ; flic filament diameter was calculated to be 20 nm. the bottom panel represents a hypothetical molecular model of hflic, where denv2 + gs linkers were modeled into native flic filament to replace d <dig> domain. the diameter of hflic was computationally determined to be 35 nm. negative stain te micrographs confirmed resulting hflic filaments had increased diameter compared to flic filament. b binding elisa was performed using denv <dig> specific monoclonal iga antibody. hflic showed binding to monoclonal iga, compared to flic alone, which showed no binding. experiments were performed in triplicate , and error bars represent mean +/- sem, student’s t-test was used to determine statistics, and a p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant. c immunogold particle labeling against denv <dig> e specific igg , was used to determine the placement of the denv <dig> e portion relative to the rest of the filament. negative stain transmission electron micrograph of immunogold labeling of wt flic filaments , confirming that no immunogold particles bound to wt filaments. right panel is a negative stain transmission electron micrograph of immunogold labeling of hflic filaments, which indicated that the immunogold particles primarily associate with the outside of the hflic filament



the inner core of the hflic filaments exhibited a high degree of contrast, comparable to tobacco mosaic virus  filaments  . however, the outer regions of the filaments displayed a low degree of contrast relative to the rest of the filament suggesting that individual denv <dig> antigen domains were able to rotate freely at the surface of the filament . this flexibility might be beneficial to the avidity of the denv <dig> antigenic domain of the polymeric hflic vaccine.

to confirm that the denv <dig> e domain retained its antigenicity, we used a denv <dig> specific recombinant iga monoclonal antibody ; this antibody was produced from sequences derived from the denv2-specific 4g <dig> hybridoma because we discovered that the original hybridoma produced mixed antibody complexes, not all being specific for denv <dig> e protein. we tested the recombinant iga binding to control recombinant denv <dig> e domain, as well as in the hybrid hflic protein and polymerized hflic filament. in an elisa assay, the denv <dig> e hflic was able to bind the 4g <dig> iga .

more importantly, we also confirmed that denv <dig> e epitopes were available on the surface of the polymerized filament. this was confirmed by immunogold labeling of the hflic filament using denv <dig> specific igg produced by the 4g <dig> hybridoma . the 4g <dig> antibody is known to bind/recognize an epitope region in the extremity of domain dii  of the denv <dig> e protein; based on our hflic molecular model, this is the domain most solvent exposed in filament formation . together, these data demonstrate 1) that the hflic protein is able to form filaments in a similar manner to wt flic, 2) the denv <dig> e subunit inserted into the middle of flic retains its conformational independence and 3) its antigenicity is retained and recognized by anti-denv <dig> e-specific antibody.

in vivo activity of hflic in td model
since we demonstrated that hflic exhibited proper conformation and antigenicity in its polymerized form, we were ready to test its ability to stimulate an immune response in vivo. using an immunization protocol similar to that used by lo et al.  <cit>  but in this case without the addition of any additional adjuvant , we tested the immunogenicity of monomeric and polymeric hflic in wild type mice . we first administered a priming dose of hflic filaments  or hflic monomers, given either intraperitoneally  or intranasally , followed by three in booster doses at one-week intervals for  <dig> additional weeks.fig.  <dig> humoral immune response in non-restricted mouse models. a purified hflic protein was polymerized in high molar ammonium sulfate and resulting filaments were pelleted with high-speed centrifugation and resuspended in 150 mm pbs. under denaturing conditions the major band was only that of the full-length hflic  schematic diagram of in vivo immunization protocol used. the immunization period was five weeks, with four injections spaced a week apart. priming injection at week zero was either administered ip or in, and the three subsequent booster doses where all administered in. c elisa scans show serum iga response in wt c57bl/6 j mice, assayed after the five-week immunization period. c57bl/6 j mice given polymeric hflic in throughout the entire immunization exhibited a strong serum iga response, while all other mice showed no iga titer. d elisa scans for serum igg response in wt c57bl/6 j, assayed after the five-week immunization period. c57bl/6 j mice given polymeric hflic ip showed a stronger igg response compared to mice given monomeric hflic ip. e elisa scans for serum igm response in wt c57bl/6 j mice assayed after the five-week immunization period. again, c57bl/6 j mice receiving polymeric hflic ip showed strongest igm response. f serum igg isotypes were assayed in c57bl/6 j mice, mice given polymeric hflic ip showed a robust igg <dig> response. all groups in immunization protocols used an n = 3- <dig> mice per group, and error bars represent the mean +/- sem, and for statistical analyses, * - p <  <dig> ; ** - p <  <dig> ; *** - p <  <dig> . values were reported as the fluorescence measured in 1: <dig> serum dilutions, with background fluorescence values subtracted



we found that hflic filaments induced a stronger antibody response than their monomeric counterparts in c57bl/6 j wt mice . ip administration of polymeric hflic during the priming injection resulted in the highest serum igg  and igm responses . mice given in priming and booster injections of polymeric hflic throughout the immunization protocol showed the strongest serum iga response . since different delivery routes gave different ig responses in different tissues, we also tested whether these immunization protocols resulted in the production of different igg subclasses . thus, polymeric hflic with either ip or in priming induced strong serum igg <dig> response, while the ip priming dose induced the best igg2a and igg2b response. in sum, the in priming protocol induced both the best iga and weakest igg2a/b response, consistent with a th2-type response. by contrast, the ip priming protocol induced the strongest igg <dig> and igm responses, though this would not be as easily categorized as a strict th1-type response.

hflic filaments can crosslink bcrs
ti responses rely on the ability of antigens to crosslink bcrs above a threshold number; this clustering promotes the t helper cell-independent differentiation of b cells into plasma cells . to determine whether the repetitive denv <dig> e determinants displayed on hflic filaments were capable of bcr crosslinking, we tested them on cells expressing receptors specific for the denv <dig> e protein. the 4g <dig> b cell hybridoma expresses surface ig receptors specific for denv <dig> e protein, so these cells were incubated with hflic filaments. confocal micrographs of cytospin slides of unstimulated cells exhibited a randomized distribution of ig receptors, while cells incubated with hflic filaments exhibited a more organized distribution of the bcrs around the circumference of the cell . this was further confirmed by staining with an anti-histag antibody , suggesting that the hflic filament was in direct contact with the bcr receptors and these receptors had in fact been clustered by the hflic filaments.fig.  <dig> hybrid flagellin filaments are able to crosslink bcr in vitro.
a schematic of how ti immune response is generated. polymeric antigens bind to b cell receptors and crosslink them. once this crosslinking event occurs, the b cell will self-differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibodies. b 4g <dig> b cell hybridoma  stimulated with polymeric hflic. stimulated cells showed more organized expression of ig receptors compared to unstimulated cells, indicating cells were crosslinked . this was further confirmed by staining with anti-histag antibody



in vivo activity of hflic polymers in tcr restricted model
to test the potential for the polymeric vaccine to induce ti responses, we performed in vivo immunization in a t cell repertoire-restricted model . here we used a t cell receptor transgenic mouse model , in which nearly all cd <dig> t cells express the mono-specific hemagglutinin-specific antigen receptor. allelic exclusion during thymic selection would prevent the development of t cells expressing any additional antigen receptors. this particular transgenic mouse model was chosen because the degree of allelic exclusion is more potent in this model compared to most other models, obviating the need for including additional targeted genes  that would cripple the immune system. as a result, the monospecific cd <dig> t cell population only recognizes an antigen from influenza not seen under normal conditions, and so any cd <dig> t helper cells would be unable to provide cognate antigen-specific help to flic- or denv-specific b cells. since a relatively normal number of t cells are still produced, all other components of the immune system, including organized lymphoid tissues, would still develop normally. since the  <dig> -tcr mice were on a b <dig> d <dig> background, b <dig> d <dig> mice were used as wt controls.fig.  <dig> humoral immune response in ti mouse model . a schematic diagram of in vivo immunization protocol used. the immunization period was five weeks, with four injections spaced a week apart. priming injection at week zero was either administered ip or in, and the three subsequent booster doses were administered . b elisa scans of serum igm in  <dig> -tcr and b <dig> d <dig> over five-week immunization period. only mice given polymeric hflic ip in the priming dose showed a serum igm response. all groups b <dig> d <dig> mice immunized showed a strong igm response. statistics were determined by unpaired student’s t-test, p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant, and error bars represent the mean +/- sem. c elisa scans of serum igg isotypes in  <dig> -tcr, and b <dig> d <dig> mice.  <dig> -tcr mice given polymeric hflic ip in the priming dose exhibited a specific igg <dig> response, meanwhile b <dig> d <dig> mice showed broader subclass distribution . all groups in immunization protocols used an n = 3- <dig> mice per group, and error bars represent the mean +/- sem. values were reported as the fluorescence measured in 1: <dig> serum dilution in the case of igm and igg isotypes for b <dig> d <dig> immunized mice, and values were reported as the fluorescence measured in 1: <dig> serum dilution for igg isotype for  <dig> -tcr immunized mice, with background fluorescence values subtracted, and for statistical analyses, * - p <  <dig> ; ** - p <  <dig> ; *** - p <  <dig> . arrows show that there was a specifically increased igg <dig> response in  <dig> -tcr mice to ip hflic filament while igg2b responses were higher to monomer, while by contrast, in b <dig> d <dig> mice igg <dig> and igg2a responses were strong to both ip hflic filament and monomer



with an immunization protocol using hflic filaments administered ip ,  <dig> -tcr mice were still capable of producing a strong serum igm response within the range of b <dig> d <dig> controls ; no detectable levels of iga were observed in any condition . interestingly, b <dig> d <dig> mice treated with polymeric hflic in three ip doses exhibited the most robust igm and igg of any group of mice used in this study , raising the possibility that this protocol was particularly effective in targeting peritoneal b <dig> cells. finally, we wanted to determine whether differences existed in the igg isotypes produced in wild type b <dig> d <dig> or the tcr restricted  mice, as the igg <dig> subclass has been previously identified as more prominent in ti antibody responses  <cit> . b <dig> d <dig> mice showed a robust th <dig> serum igg2b response, with a lower serum igg <dig> response . interestingly, although igg titers were lower in the  <dig> -tcr mice compared to b <dig> d <dig> mice due to the absence of cognate t cell help,  <dig> -tcr mice given hflic filament ip showed a significant igg <dig> response .

discussion
taken together, these data suggest that hflic filaments are indeed capable of inducing a significant antibody response in a t cell restricted model. development of vaccines with multivalent binding  has largely been accomplished by the linkage of two proteins in a linear fashion; however, this method has had limited success in certain diseases . thus, the reengineering of flic by replacing its solvent exposed flic d <dig> domain with a conformationally intact viral envelope protein domain may hold promise for an entirely new vaccine framework. this may be especially important in the development of vaccines for patients with less robust immune systems, including those in the early perinatal period, in people suffering from various t cell immunodeficiency disorders , patients undergoing chemotherapy, as well as elderly patients with sluggish adaptive immunity.

the increased potency of the hflic relative to the monomeric form may relate to multiple factors. in the polymeric form the antigen may be more able to cross-link the antigen-specific b cell receptors. as a less soluble complex the filament may also be more easily taken up by antigen presenting cells for stimulation of t helper cells. in addition, the polymeric antigen may also have a greater potential to recruit the t helper-independent b- <dig> b cell population; this is evidenced by the strong igm and igg <dig> response in the  <dig> -tcr mice when hflic filaments were injected into the peritoneum, where b- <dig> b cells are dominant. more detailed studies on the igm  response will be helpful in determining any benefit in recruiting b- <dig> b cells in protective immunity, as it may help recruit a distinctive antibody repertoire.

to date no licensed vaccine exists for denv infection. this is complicated by the concern that sub-neutralizing levels of cross-reactive anti-denv antibodies might result in more severe disease . this strategy may overcome the problem noted in a recent trial with a tetravalent recombinant vaccine, in which the response to one serotype was much lower than the response to the other serotypes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we reengineered the native flic structure by replacing the flic d <dig> domain to contain a conformationally intact denv <dig> e protein domain, without compromising either protein’s structure. moreover, this hybrid protein could be polymerized to produce filaments capable of stimulating a humoral antibody response; filaments were found to be more potent induces of antibody responses than monomers. more importantly, these hybrid protein filaments were capable of crosslinking b cell antigen receptors in vitro and accordingly were also shown to induce significant antibody responses even in a t cell repertoire-restricted transgenic mouse model. in sum, this study lays the groundwork for the use of flic as a vaccine scaffold for development of novel vaccines for use even in immunodeficiency settings.
