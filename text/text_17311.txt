BACKGROUND
social insects, especially those belonging to the order hymenoptera, have been an extremely successful group. they take on a wide diversity of roles around the world, and while some are considered as pests, others are seen as vital for ecosystem functioning and even commercial prosperity. bumblebees  fall into the latter beneficial groups, being important members of natural pollinator assemblages and providing commercial pollination services  <cit> .

bumblebees have been an object of diverse scientific study due to their importance, behaviour, social life, and a number of other fascinating traits. to name but a few, bumblebees have been utilised in research on social evolution  <cit>  and organisation  <cit> , development  <cit> , plant-pollinator interactions  <cit> , learning  <cit> , invasion biology  <cit> , host-parasite ecology  <cit> , ecological immunology  <cit> , and community ecology  <cit> . while not officially domesticated, bumblebees still present an important agricultural resource with a significant economic load  <cit> . bumblebees in both europe  and north america  are bred commercially by the hundred thousands for this reason, with the colonies being used in the pollination of a variety of standard glasshouse crops  <cit> . many have considered their economic importance to be on the rise given the recent declines in honeybee numbers  <cit> . bumblebees not only provide valuable pollination services in the agricultural sector, but the pollination they carry out is an integral part of many natural ecosystems  <cit> . the importance of bumblebees comes sharply into focus when we consider the threat that pollinators currently face worldwide. this pollinator crisis has been epitomised by the recent honeybee colony collapse disorder  <cit> , but the bumblebee has also suffered population declines in many areas over a number of decades  <cit> .

given their importance, a good knowledge of bumblebees from the genomic level up is of great interest. an improved set of genomic resources for bumblebees would facilitate further studies in the bumblebee, and comparisons with other bees such as the honeybee, apis mellifera, where the genome is already sequenced  <cit> . there is currently a limited set of resources available for genetic investigation, and at the time of writing, for b. terrestris, there were  <dig> cdna sequences and  <dig> nucleotide sequences  in ncbi genbank . further tools available include a linkage map for b. terrestris  <cit>  and a bac library  <cit> .

in order to greatly expand the genomic resources available for b. terrestris we constructed a normalised expressed sequence tag  library from thorax and abdomen tissue of workers. ests are short, unedited, randomly selected, single pass reads from cdna libraries  <cit> . they provide evidence of transcriptionally active regions in an organism and are an excellent resource for upstream work including gene discovery, functional genomics and marker discovery  <cit> . standard cdna libraries can have problems with redundancy, and rare transcripts are often under-represented. therefore, we employed normalisation in order to increase the number of unique transcripts discovered  <cit> .

here we describe a collection of  <dig>  ests, which represent a valuable resource for further ecological and evolutionary studies in bombus spp. and for comparative studies with other hymenoptera and insects. sequences have been deposited in the genbank, embl, and ddbj nucleotide sequence databases under the accession numbers fn <dig> through to fn <dig>  for further material, including consensus sequences of assembled contigs, please contact the authors.

RESULTS
sequence assembly and features
a total of  <dig>  quality controlled est sequences were assembled using tgi clustering tools . the assembly generated  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singletons. the average number of sequences per contig was  <dig>  with the maximum being  <dig>  contigs averaged  <dig> bases in length with the longest contig being  <dig>  bases. in total  <dig>  unique sequences were produced. a table showing all est and contig statistics can be found as an additional file .

sequence annotation
the  <dig>  unique sequences were used in a blastx search against the non-redundant  database in genbank . a total of  <dig>   ests had significant "hits"  . of these, the majority  had "best-hits" to known sequences within the hymenoptera, with a large proportion  of these belonging to apis spp a total of  <dig>  sequences  had no significant similarity to any sequences contained in the nr database . it is possible that many of these sequences without "hits" are cdnas of known proteins, but consist mainly of untranslated regions , therefore reducing the likelihood that matches are found through blastx. however, we cannot discount the possibility that some of the proteins are novel.

relevant groupings have been performed, but original counts on an individual taxon identifier level can be found as an additional file .

gene ontology  terms
the assembled b. terrestris ests were characterised for gene ontology terms in molecular function, biological process and cellular component by comparison against annotated proteins in the swissprot and trembl databases  using annot8r  <cit> . in order to increase the accuracy of any annotations, only go terms that had been allocated by manual curation, and not those electronically inferred, were used. the distribution of the terms in each of the go slim overview categories can be seen in table  <dig>  and the full go assignments can be found as an additional file . further, the same process was completed for predicted proteins in the a. mellifera and tribolium castaneum genomes  <cit> . this allowed for a comparison to be made with the distribution of terms that we obtained for the b. terrestris unique sequences in this study. general patterns of distribution were similar between organisms, with limited exceptions where particular go slim categories were over- or under- represented in the b. terrestris unique sequences .

actual counts appear in brackets after the percentage. major categories of molecular function, biological process and cellular component are treated independently.

comparisons to the honeybee and other insects
the gc content of the b. terrestris unique sequences was calculated to be  <dig> percent . gene regions in the a. mellifera genome have a gc content of  <dig> percent, while in d. melanogaster and a. gambiae it is  <dig> and  <dig> percent, respectively  <cit> . the gc percentage based on these b. terrestris ests suggests that lower gc content of gene regions is not restricted to apis, and may be a wider phenomenon. however, calculations of gc-content in nasonia vitripennis mrna  at  <dig> percent hint that it is not hymenopteran wide and further species would need to be studied to determine the exact range of this low gc-content.

we compared the b. terrestris unique sequences to proteins from genomes of each of four other insects, a. mellifera, n. vitripennis, t. castaneum and d. melanogaster  . the hierarchy of "hits" to each of these four insects reflects the evolutionary relationship between them and the bumblebee  <cit> , with the closest related of the four, a. mellifera, giving  <dig>  percent more "hits" than the most distantly realted, d. melanogaster. despite this,  <dig> unique sequences from this est project have significant "hits" to all of these insects except for a. mellifera. potential explanations for this discrepancy include an incomplete annotation of genes in the a. mellifera genome or loss of genes or their protein coding capacity following the split from bombus in the lineage leading to apis .

the  <dig>  "hits" of unique sequences to a. mellifera proteins were to  <dig>  unique apis proteins. this level of redundancy suggests that  <dig> percent of the assembled sequences are actually derived from unique genes, yielding an estimation of  <dig>  unique genes represented by this est library. in addition to a comparison with the predicted proteins in the a. mellifera genome, the unique sequences derived from the b. terrestris est library were also compared to the entire a. mellifera genome sequence   <cit> . a total of  <dig>  unique sequences had "hits" to the genome,  <dig>  of which already had "hits" to predicted a. mellifera proteins, but  <dig>  which did not. these unique sequences with "hits" to the genome were distributed on the apis linkage groups as follows, with the figure in brackets being the percent distribution of actual apis protein coding sequences:  <dig>   percent on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on lg  <dig>   <dig>   on lg <dig>   <dig>   on the mitochondria and  <dig>   on unassembled regions.

particularly interesting is the apparent discrepancy between the number of b. terrestris unique sequences with matches to a. mellifera proteins and the number with matches to the a. mellifera genome. in fact, of the  <dig> unique sequences that had "hits" to all the other insect proteins tested but not apis,  <dig> have "hits" to the apis genome. there are a variety of possible reasons for a unique sequence having a "hit" to the apis genome but not to predicted proteins from the same organism. the most obvious, is that the sequences in question are related to known apis proteins, but they mainly contain untranslated regions  and therefore do not produce significant "hits" in blastx alignments. when comparing the locations of the start of "hits" to the genome and the positions of predicted apis protein coding sequences,  <dig> are either inside a protein coding sequence or span the boundary of one, suggesting that they comprise mostly of utrs. furthermore,  <dig>  of the "hits" were within the range of possible apis utrs . however, this still left  <dig>  sequences, including  <dig> of the unique sequences that had "hits" to proteins from all the other insects tested but not apis. these  <dig>  sequences were further analysed for the presence of orfs using orf finder http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf. the median orf size was  <dig> nucleotides  suggesting that many of the unique sequences have the potential to encode proteins. while some of these "hits" to the apis genome may be spurious, it is possible that they are the result of either incomplete gene annotation in the a. mellifera genome or evolution of pseudogenes in the apis lineage. in an attempt to gain a further insight into these possibilities, from the  <dig> unique sequences with the longest predicted reading frames we inspected more closely the sequences that had a highly significant "hit" to another insect protein  . by "blasting" these proteins against the apis genome , we attempted to find reasons that these proteins are not in the set of predicted apis proteins. all six of the proteins had "best-hits" in the same location of the genome as the unique sequences had, and visual inspection of alignments revealed premature stop codons were coded for in the apis sequences in four out of the six cases.

unique sequences, from the sequences with the  <dig> longest orfs that have "hits" to the apis genome at least 4' <dig> bases away from predicted apis protein coding regions, with highly significant "best-hits"  to an insect protein. these "best-hit" insect proteins were "blasted" against the apis genome  and the resulting alignments scanned for potential elements hindering protein production.

immune genes and pathways
while the bumblebee workers used to produce this est library were not immune challenged, the vast amount of work on immunity and host-parasite interactions in these insects  <cit>  makes this category of genes nonetheless worthy of further interest. furthermore, parasites have been implicated in declines of natural and commercial pollinators, such as bumblebees, worldwide  <cit> , and thus knowledge of genes and pathways involved in immunity and parasite defence is highly important.

based on the annotations of the unique sequences, and in comparison with proposed a. mellifera immune genes  <cit> , we find that  <dig> unique sequences have "best hits" to proteins from genes characterised as immune related . these  <dig> unique sequences in bombus terrestris match to  <dig> apis genes . in addition, based on the classification by sackton et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> unique sequences have "best-hits" in d. melanogaster to proteins of  <dig> immune genes. however, a core set of only  <dig> unique sequences had both immune classified "hits" in d. melanogaster and a. mellifera, with "hits" to  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively. this could be due differential annotation of immune genes in the two organisms, or different divergence from b. terrestris among different genes.

the potential immune gene transcripts found span the major described pathways in the invertebrate immune system , and based on these certain components, we can begin to build a picture of immune defence in bumblebees. we find that there is evidence for the existence and transcription of integral genes in each of the described pathways.

potential est-derived genetic markers
traditional methods of isolating and characterising genetic markers can be expensive and time-consuming. however, ests can be a valuable resource for the initial identification of genetic markers that can subsequently be used in studies of molecular ecology  <cit> . simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms  allow population level studies both within the target species and related species.

using misa  <cit> , a number of ssrs were identified in the unique sequences. we restricted our search for ssrs to di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexa- nucleotide motifs that were repeated at least six times for di-nucleotide and five times for all other motifs. we found a total of  <dig> markers found in  <dig> unique sequences.  <dig> di- ,  <dig> tri- ,  <dig> tetra- ,  <dig> penta- , and  <dig> hexa-  nucleotide repeats were found.  <dig> of the ssrs were found in compound formation with another . while polymorphism remains to be verified for these markers with appropriate laboratory screens, previous levels of polymorphism in est derived ssrs suggest that a large number of these markers will be variable  <cit> .

these identified potential ssrs together with existing markers from b. terrestris  <cit>  make up a significant resource for molecular ecology studies. while est derived ssrs tend to show a lower level of polymorphism than those identified from genomic libraries, they can more often be used across related species  <cit> . given the pervasive importance of species of the genus bombus in temperate pollinator communities, this is a highly advantageous feature. in addition to ssrs, contigs built from a number of est reads can be useful sources of potential snps. while the normalization procedure used in this work reduces such redundancy and thus the likelihood of finding snps,  <dig>  contigs contain at least four sequences, a minimum for reliable identification of snps  <cit> . these contigs cover  <dig> , <dig> bases. using snpidentifier  <cit>  with minimum minor allele frequency of  <dig>  and a minimum occurrence of  <dig>  we were able to find  <dig> potential snps occuring in  <dig> contigs. these potential snps provide an additional set of genetic markers for subsequent population studies.

CONCLUSIONS
the resource provided by the presented est library will serve researchers in a diverse range of biological fields. the detected markers will facilitate further population level studies, and the sequences themselves can be used in investigations of particular genes, and also in functional genomic approaches. further, as demonstrated here, the sequences allow genomic comparisons with the honeybee a. mellifera and other insects, informing on such things as potential gene loss or pseudogene evolution. this est library will also be a practical resource in the assembly and annotation of the impending b. terrestris genome http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu. these elements, coupled with the major commercial and ecosystem functions of b. terrestris and related hymenoptera, mean that this est library is a useful resource for ongoing research.
