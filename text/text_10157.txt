BACKGROUND
invariant natural killer-like t  cells are placed ambiguously between adaptive and innate immune systems . derived from the thymus, expressing rearranged t-cell receptor  alpha and beta chains, they seem to belong to the adaptive immune system, while their receptor homogeneity, their continuous state of activation, their rapid secretion of large amounts of interferon -γ and interleukin - <dig>  their presumed recognition of invariant glycolipid self-ligands associated with the non-classical major histocompatibility  class i molecule, cd <dig> d, recall various aspects of innate immune recognition. many features of inkt cell behaviour are puzzling: their thymic ontogeny and relation to the classical pathways of t-cell mediated differentiation; the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous ligands in activation; and the polarity of their cytokine profile towards ifn-γ or il- <dig> in relation to the activating ligand. however, in this report we address the basis for another characteristic of these enigmatic cells, namely their constitutive state of readiness to respond with massive cytokine production . using a sensitive endogenous reporter for ifn-γ production, we show that inkt cells are constitutively and endogenously activated to ifn-γ production in the liver and kidney of normal mice. the activation is apparently restricted to these tissues, focal, spontaneous and independent of signals derived from bacteria or viruses. it is, however, dependent on the expression of cd <dig> d and on the presence of the classical inkt cell receptor. the results suggest that the constitutive state of inkt readiness may be maintained by intermittent local stimulation with endogenous ligands.

RESULTS
we recently demonstrated the constitutive expression of the ifn-γ-inducible, immunity-related gtpase, irga <dig>  in hepatic parenchymal cells of normal mice  <cit> . this was attributed to the presence of a dedicated, liver-specific promoter associated with this innate immune resistance gene. during these studies we noticed that the expression of irga <dig> in hepatic parenchymal cells was not uniform. small focal patches, each consisting of a few to a few dozen contiguous cells, expressed very much more irga <dig> than the general expression level . these foci of high irga <dig> expression resembled those that we reported in the kidney parenchyma associated with tubular epithelium  <cit> . about 10% of high expression foci in the liver were characterized by a central accumulation of small mononuclear cells. we could establish immunohistologically that t cells, defined by cd <dig>  and macrophage/dc lineage cells, defined by f4/ <dig>  were present in these mononuclear cell cores . the same cell types could be found adjacent to the patches of high irga <dig> expression in the kidney cortical tubular epithelium, following closely the pattern of f4/80+ dc described in mouse kidney  <cit> . in subsequent analysis of the liver we distinguished between the minority of irga <dig> expression patches with and the majority without, visible mononuclear cell cores , as they clearly have different origins . there are mononuclear cells associated with all kidney patches and the patches seem to have only one origin . high irga <dig> expression patches are not present in newborn mice but develop rapidly in both the kidney and liver between  <dig> week and  <dig> weeks after birth .

as irga <dig> expression is induced by ifn-γ  <cit> , we asked whether high expression patches were due to the local expression of ifn-γ. first, we examined the liver and kidneys of mice with genomic disruptions of components of the ifn response mechanism on the c57bl/ <dig> background   <cit>  deficiencies eliminated all high irga <dig> expression patches from the kidney and all irga <dig> patches with mononuclear cores from the liver. the liver patches without cores were not significantly affected. ifnar deficiency  <cit>  had no marked effect on either organ. as expected, all kidney patches and liver patches with mononuclear cores were eliminated by stat- <dig> deficiency. surprisingly, the high expression patches without mononuclear cell cores were also absent in the stat-1-deficient livers, even though the loss of type i and type ii ifn receptors had no effect on them. we conclude that coreless liver patches are caused by the local action of another cytokine probably not of lymphoid origin, perhaps ifn-λ  or il- <dig> which both transduce signals via stat <dig> in hepatocytes, but initiate signalling through distinct receptors  <cit> . rag <dig> deficiency  <cit>  behaved like ifn-γ or ifngr deficiency, eliminating all irga <dig> high expression foci with mononuclear cores from the liver, showing that lymphocytes with rearranged receptor chains were required for the focal expression patches with mononuclear cell cores but not for the coreless patches. it was not possible to assess high expression patches in kidney because of near universal high expression in these organs . no liver phenotype was detected in b-cell-deficient jht mice  <cit> , excluding b cells from further consideration. again, excessive high expression was found in the kidneys .

secondly, if ifn-γ is responsible for the focal induction of irga <dig>  there should be activation in the high expression patches of the ifn-γ-dependent promoter of the irga <dig> gene, with the use of exon 1a, in contrast to the general hepatic parenchyma in which the liver-specific promoter is constitutively expressed with usage of exon 1b  <cit> . we therefore isolated high expression patches and areas of general expression level by laser microdissection and used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  in order to identify the use of the ifn-γ-dependent 5'-untranslated 1a exon and the constitutively expressed 5'-untranslated 1b exon in the two tissue sites . expression of the ifn-γ-dependent exon 1a was  <dig> × higher by qrt-pcr in the high expression patches than in the general liver, while 1b exon expression was not altered . however, when the irga6-1a pcr products from the general liver were cloned and sequenced, only  <dig> % of were specific , while 100% of those cloned from the high expression patches were specific. thus, the true excess of irga6-1a in the high expression patches relative to the general parenchyma was  <dig> ×  <dig> / <dig>  or about 470×, confirming the intense local induction by ifn-γ.

thirdly, if ifn-γ is being secreted locally, affected cells should express not only irga <dig> but also other members of the ifn-γ-inducible irg protein family that are not constitutively expressed in hepatic parenchymal cells  <cit> . we therefore stained adjacent histological sections of liver and kidney for irga <dig> and for irgm <dig>  indeed, focal expression of irgm <dig> coincided accurately with the high irga <dig> expression patches .

direct evidence for the expression of ifn-γ in the patches with mononuclear cell cores, but not in the coreless patches, was obtained by rt-pcr for ifn-γ transcripts in microdissected patch material. a strong signal for ifn-γ was recovered from only the patches with mononuclear cell cores . these experiments established beyond doubt that the liver and kidney contain reactive foci of local, t-cell-dependent ifn-γ production identified by the local high expression of irga <dig> 

the character of the small ifn-γ-secreting reactive foci in the liver and kidney suggested that they could be due to local immune activity stimulated by microbial material. we therefore analysed the liver and kidney for reactive foci from mice deficient in components of the toll-le receptor  system . no effects were seen in mice deficient in tlr <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> or myd <dig>  arguing against bacterial components as the initiators of the foci. in order to test this conclusion further, we examined the liver and kidney from germ-free mice from three independent sources. no significant reduction in numbers of reactive foci in liver or spleen was detected . bacterial infection is, thus, unlikely to be a stimulus for the reactive foci

two further explanations were considered for the focal ifn-γ production. one was the local re-expression of an endogenous mouse mammary tumour virus  open reading frame acting as a superantigen . the other was local activation of inkt cells. these two possibilities could be distinguished by a knowledge of the v gene usage of t cells in the mononuclear cores. in the case of a superantigen, specific vβ families should be favoured, but no specific vα usage, while in inkt cells, a specific and diagnostic pattern of vβ8/vα14jα <dig> could be anticipated  <cit> . we used laser microdissection to isolate and pool the mononuclear cell cores from many high irga <dig> expression patches and employed semi-nested pcr on reverse-transcribed cdna to amplify, and subsequently clone, vα and vβ from expressed tcrs. the result for vβ usage was striking, namely, the exclusive usage of the three vβ <dig> genes, with an excess of vβ <dig>   in contrast to the diversity of vβ genes recovered by the same technique from lymph node lymphocytes. we were able to confirm the high use of vβ <dig> in mononuclear core t cells immunohistologically with a specific anti-vβ <dig> monoclonal antibody . vβ <dig> is uncommon, but not unknown, as a mmtv superantigen target  <cit>  but is part of the diagnostic receptor combination of inkt cells  <cit> . we therefore amplified by rt-pcr a number of specific vα families from lymph node cells and from mononuclear cell cores . in lymph node t cells a weak signal for vα <dig> was seen, compared with strong signals for vα <dig> and vα <dig>  from the mononuclear core cells a strong signal was seen for vα <dig>  an unclear result for vα <dig> and a weaker signal for vα <dig>  however, the true excess of vα <dig> in the core cells was striking since the weak signal of vα <dig> from lymph nodes proved, on cloning and sequencing, to be due, with a single exception, to the amplification of vα <dig> which is closely related to vα <dig>  in contrast, all except one of the clones amplified for vα <dig> from mononuclear cell cores of liver patches were indeed vα <dig> . thus, the tcr v-gene usage of the mononuclear cell cores was consistent with the tcrs of inkt cells. this was further confirmed by showing that exclusively the canonical jα <dig> was used with no length variation .

if the nkt function is dependent on a dedicated vβ8/vα <dig> tcr and is responsible for the high expression patches in liver and kidney, these should be reduced in mice carrying deletions in the tcr vβ gene array that include the vβ <dig> family of sequences  <cit> . we analysed the numbers of liver core patches and kidney high expression patches in inbred mouse strains of known tcr vβ genotype, in each case comparing patch frequencies with c57bl/ <dig>  tissues from the a/j and c57brcdj strains, with normal vβ <dig> gene representation, were similar to c57bl/ <dig> . however, five strains with vβ <dig> deletions  all showed reduction down to a more or less complete loss of cored liver patches and kidney patches. the residual kidney and cored liver patches in these strains may, perhaps, be attributed to usage of vβ <dig> and vβ <dig>  v-genes that also contribute to a minority of inkt receptors  <cit> , although we did not find these subgroups in our analysis in c57bl/ <dig> . swr mice had an unexplained deficit of plain liver patches.

if the irga <dig> high expression foci with mononuclear cores associated with high ifn-γ production were, indeed, due to inkt cells, they should also be absent from mice deficient in the essential ligand-presenting molecule cd <dig> d  <cit>  and in mice deficient in inkt cells as a result of deletion of the diagnostic jα <dig> t cell receptor segment  <cit> . both these predictions were fulfilled, with a substantial loss of high irga <dig> expression patches from the kidney and cored patches from the liver in both mutants . the patches of high irga <dig> expression in the liver without mononuclear cores were not affected in either case. in order to find out whether cd4+ or cd8+ t cells play any additional role in the induction of high irga <dig> expression patches, organs from mice lacking mhc aβb  and tap <dig>  were also examined. patches of high irga <dig> expression were normal in liver and kidney from both strains. thus, inkt cells alone appear to be responsible for the high irga <dig> expression foci.

we present direct evidence for the constitutive activation of mouse inkt cells in two organs, the liver and the kidneys, generating small foci of high ifn-γ expression detected by the local high expression of an ifn-γ-inducible cytoplasmic protein, irga <dig>  in a previous study, we surveyed the pattern of constitutive irga <dig> expression in a number of other organs and high expression foci were not seen  <cit> . the liver and kidneys thus appear to be special in this respect. our results suggest a local activation event that triggers production of type ii interferon by inkt cells. the mouse liver sinusoids are known to contain a major population of nkt cells and nkt cells have been reported in the kidney, probably corresponding to the t cells identified in the tubulo-interstitial spaces  <cit> . dendritic cells  and hepatic stellate cells   <cit>  can both present exogenous α-galcer via cd <dig> d to inkt cells. stellate cells of the liver sinusoids have also been shown to be il-15-dependent activators of inkt cells to proliferation in the absence of exogenous antigen  <cit> . an apparently similar cell type is also found in the tubular cortex of the kidney essentially co-localizing with dendritic cells  <cit> . both dc and stellate cells are strong candidates for the activating cell implied by our experiments, but this does not, by itself, account for the focal triggering event. our experiments with germ-free and tlr-deficient mice make bacterial products acting on dc tlrs  <cit>  an unlikely cause. more plausible would, perhaps, be a locally reactivating endogenous retrovirus triggering dc or stellate cells and, thereby, inkt cells locally. arguing against a primary viral stimulus, we could show no deficit in liver cored high expression patches or kidney patches in organs from mice deficient in mavs/cardif  <cit> , the common activation pathway of the cytosolic rig helicases that act as viral sensors .

it will be interesting to know how the spontaneous activation of inkt cells and consequent constitutive ifn-γ production in liver and kidney of major inbred strains of mouse affects immunological function in these organs. nkt cells have been identified very recently as a minority population among normal resident lymphocytes in mouse kidney and both an excitatory role in ischaemia-reperfusion injury  <cit>  and an inhibitory role in experimental glomerular nephritis induction by anti glomerular basement membrane antibody  <cit>  have been described. likewise, the large population of nkt cells that patrol the liver sinusoids  <cit>  have been implicated in various liver disorders  <cit> , but their spontaneous, focal activation has not been reported. spontaneous focal activation of nkt cells in the liver and kidney with high local levels of ifn-γ will have to be considered in future studies of immune function in these organs.

CONCLUSIONS
invariant natural killer t  cells are activated spontaneously in mouse liver and kidney. these activation events are local, probably extravascular, and result in the local secretion of ifn-γ. this in turn results in the local induction of ifn-γ-responsive genes in non-immune tissue cells, namely hepatic parenchymal cells and renal tubular epithelial cells. these activation events are spontaneous in the sense that they appear to be independent of exogenous pathogenic material of bacterial or viral origin. the cause of individual activation events is still unclear. in general, however, the results are consistent with a widely held view that inkt cells are rendered spontaneously active by interaction with an endogenous ligand. in this study we demonstrate these activation events histologically. further investigations may reveal the nature of the stimulatory event that lies at the heart of each activating focus. it will be important to generalise these findings to the human case, and to assess the implications of these findings for liver and kidney immunopathology.
