BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  represent the largest group of integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction and are the most important targets of clinically marketed drugs  <cit> . the known gpcrs mediate messages from ligands as diverse as neurotransmitters, lipid mediators, hormones, and sensory stimuli  <cit> . the classical scheme of gpcr signaling implies that agonist-induced conformational changes in receptor molecule will result in activation of cognate g proteins and subsequently in the regulation of downstream effectors, second messengers, and the activation of protein kinases, for example  <cit> . however, recent work has indicated that gpcr signaling is subject to complex, cell-type specific regulation, involving a plethora of kinases, as well as newly-identified signaling partners, such as regulators of g protein signaling   <cit> , and activators of g protein signaling   <cit> .

nitric oxide  is a unique gaseous messenger generated in vivo by three isoforms of no synthases . the established mode of no signaling is through the activation of the hemoprotein, soluble guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of the second messenger cgmp. however, accumulating evidence points towards cgmp-independent mechanisms by which no can react with proteins, forming covalent post-translational modifications  <cit> . s-nitrosothiols  are biological metabolites of no, that may prolong and spatially extend the in vivo actions of locally produced no  <cit> . no and rsnos can reversibly react with free sh-groups of target cysteine  residues, including those in proteins, leading to s-nitrosylation and/or s-thiolation   <cit> . a broad functional spectrum of potential s-nitrosylation target proteins is currently recognized. a growing list of targets include ion channels, transporters, transcription factors, signaling proteins, metabolic enzymes, as well as respiratory proteins  <cit> . although individual components of the gpcr signaling machinery are implicated as potential targets of reactive oxygen species , including no  <cit> , a broader view on how no, and rsnos in particular, might modulate gpcr signaling, has not been established.

to begin to address these issues, we have studied how exogenous rsnos affect receptor-mediated g protein activity – a very proximal step of gpcr signal transduction – by studying the signaling of several receptors that couple to the gi family of heterotrimeric g proteins. this family consists of both pertussis toxin sensitive  and insensitive  members. we applied the powerful functional approach of gtpγs autoradiography in brain cryostat sections, as this technique allows selective detection of receptor-dependent g protein activity simultaneously in multiple brain regions with minimal disturbance of the gpcr microenvironment  <cit> . we anticipated that accessibility of target thiols would be minimally disturbed in cryostat sections. moreover, it is increasingly recognized that specialized plasma membrane microdomains  act as unique signaling platforms with specific enrichment of gpcrs, their cognate g proteins, as well as effectors  <cit> . such an enrichment is thought to be well-preserved in cryostat sections, but might be compromised to a variable extent  <cit> , or even lost in bulk membrane preparations obtained using traditional protocols. to complement the autoradiography approach, we used membrane and lysate gtpγs binding assays to more systematically study the effects of rsnos on a panel of gi-coupled receptors in native tissues. signaling of selected receptors was further studied after their heterologous expression in chinese hamster ovary  cells. our studies reveal highly receptor-specific modulation of gpcr signaling by rsnos, as signaling of some receptors can be amplified, or inhibited, whereas for others, the activity is only marginally affected by comparable treatments. the gpcr itself and/or its native signaling partners seem to act as potential targets of rsno action, and therefore their modulation may be diminished, or even totally masked under heterologous expression.

RESULTS
exogenous rsnos modulate gpcr signaling via mechanisms likely involving s-nitrosylation
we used the functional approach of gtpγs autoradiography, as this technique allows selective detection of receptor-stimulated gi protein activity simultaneously in multiple brain structures with minimal disturbance of the gpcr microenvironment  <cit> . we focused the initial experiments on three gi-linked receptors, namely m2/m <dig> achrs, the p2y <dig> purinoceptor, and the lpa <dig> receptor, as g protein activity upon stimulation of these receptors has been previously characterized using the autoradiography approach and each receptor shows a unique anatomical distribution pattern in the developing rat brain  <cit> . as depicted in figure  <dig>  pretreatment of brain sections with freshly prepared gsno  had distinct effects on basal and receptor-stimulated gtpγs binding responses. in gsno-treated sections, basal g protein activity was increased throughout the gray matter areas and this effect was fully reversed in the presence of excess thiol, either in the form of dithiotreitol  or reduced glutathione . the autoradiography images were quantified for selected brain regions and these results are shown in supplementary figures  <dig> and  <dig> . consistent with the anatomical distribution of atropine-sensitive and m2/m <dig> achr-dependent g protein activity  <cit> , the cholinergic agonist carbachol  stimulated gtpγs binding to multiple gray matter regions, including the striatum , the thalamic structures, with the most intense responses in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus , as well as various brainstem  nuclei. in all visible regions, cch-stimulated g protein activity was robustly amplified by gsno. this was particularly evident in the above-mentioned m2/m <dig> receptor-enriched anatomical loci. it is noteworthy that the gsno effects were fully reversed in all regions in the presence of dtt or gsh . as further illustrated in figure  <dig>  the p2y receptor agonist 2-methylthio-adp  activated g proteins both in gray and white matter regions, producing a heterogeneous activity pattern with characteristic "hot spot" appearance, as described earlier  <cit> . previous studies have established that the 2mesadp-stimulated g protein activity in rat brain sections is mediated by a p2y receptor subtype that pharmacologically corresponds to p2y <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the robust amplification of m2/m <dig> receptor-dependent g protein activity, gsno clearly inhibited p2y <dig> receptor signaling . this inhibition was evident throughout the effective agonist concentration range , and responses to the endogenous agonist adp  were similarly blunted . the gsno-effect was fully reversible upon addition of dtt or gsh . in the developing rat brain, lpa-stimulated gi protein activity is largely restricted to the myelinating white matter tracts  <cit>  , closely reflecting the anatomical distribution of lpa <dig> receptor subtype . similar to the p2y <dig> responses, lpa <dig> receptor responses were suppressed in gsno-treated sections throughout the white matter tracts. also this effect was fully reversed in the presence of thiols .

gsno is present in significant amounts  in the brain tissue and it is thought to act as a physiological carrier of no for s-nitrosylation reactions  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> and supplementary figure  <dig> , gsno modulated gpcr responses in a dose-dependent manner, being effective at the submillimolar concentration range. however, the threshold and maximal concentrations needed for the modulation of distinct receptors slightly varied. potentiation of m2/m <dig> receptor signaling was evident already with  <dig>  mm gsno, but statistically significant responses were obtained using  <dig>  –  <dig> mm gsno . p2y <dig> receptor responses were inhibited with  <dig>  mm gsno and higher concentrations . lpa <dig> receptor signaling was only marginally affected with  <dig>  mm gsno, but was severely blunted with  <dig>  mm gsno and higher concentrations . collectively, these experiments demonstrate that gsno, a physiologically relevant rsno, can modulate gpcr signaling in discrete brain regions in a receptor-specific and fully reversible manner.

various rsnos, including s-nitrosocysteine  , s-nitrosocysteamine, s-nitroso-l-cysteinylglycine , l-γ-glutamyl-s-nitrosocysteine , and s-nitroso-n-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine  – a compound with a sterically hindered sno group – mimicked the effects of gsno on the three studied receptors . when equimolar concentrations  of gsno and snap were compared, snap equally well suppressed p2y <dig> receptor responses, whereas gsno more efficiently modulated m2/m <dig> and lpa <dig> receptor responses . the modulatory effect of cysno on the three receptors was reversed by addition of dtt or cysteine . however, when "aged" cysno was used , receptor-stimulated g protein activity was almost completely abolished .

previous studies have suggested that rsnos can act as no+, no., and no- donors under physiological conditions  <cit> . the rsno effects on gpcr responses were not mimicked by the no donor sodium nitroprusside , when tested at similar  concentrations . furthermore, the no+-releasing no donor, nitrosodium tetrafluoroborate  , hydrogen peroxide  , or the cyclic gmp analog 8-bromo-cyclic gmp   were largely ineffective. for selected brain regions, quantitative autoradiography data on cysno, snp and 8-bromo-cyclic gmp are presented in the supplementary table  <dig> .

the above results demonstrate that the effects of no-related species was shared by -and restricted to – different classes of rsno compounds, suggesting that s-nitrosylation rather than other types of no reactions, or cgmp-dependent mechanisms, were involved. according to the s-nitrosylation scheme, treatment with exogenous rsnos should result in transnitrosylation of potential protein thiols . to demonstrate the presence of sno moieties in gsno-treated brain section, we used the indirect approach where heterolytic cleavage of s-no bond with hgcl <dig> generates nitrite which can be measured by a colorimetric method. to this end, brain sections were treated with gsno , and after thorough washes, the sections were incubated further in the absence or presence of hgcl <dig> . these experiments  revealed that hgcl2-catalyzed nitrite formation was significantly higher in gsno treated sections than that in control conditions . collectively these experiments suggest that the rsno-evoked and receptor-specific modulation of gpcr signaling in brain sections most likely involves s-nitrosylation mechanisms.

rsnos modulate gpcr signaling in native tissues in a highly receptor-specific manner
although gtpγs autoradiography offers the advantage of monitoring g protein activity simultaneously in multiple brain regions with minimal disturbance of the gpcr microenvironment, generating quantitative data from the autoradiography images is relatively tedious. as a complementary approach, we tested the effect of rsnos on agonist potency and efficacy for several additional gi-coupled receptors using classical membrane and lysate gtpγs binding assays. the results of these experiments are summarized in table  <dig>  there was one major difference from the situation with brain sections; in the rat forebrain membrane preparations gsno did not significantly affect basal g protein activity . however, gsno modulation of receptor-mediated responses was found to be highly receptor-specific. in line with the autoradiography data, m2/m <dig> receptor signaling was markedly amplified  whereas lpa-evoked signaling efficacy  was significantly decreased in the rat forebrain membrane preparations. moreover, the efficacy of cannabinoid cb <dig> receptor signaling was significantly inhibited with no concomitant change in agonist potency . gtpγs autoradiography studies further indicated that cb <dig> receptor signaling was similarly inhibited in various cb <dig> receptor-enriched brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus and the globus pallidus . on the other hand, signaling via other widely distributed receptors, such as adenosine a <dig>  μ-opioid  and opiate-related receptor , was only marginally , or not detectably , altered in bulk membrane preparations  or in brain cryostat sections . for the three receptors, quantitative autoradiography data on selected brain regions are presented in supplementary table  <dig> .

cho cells express endogenous gi-coupled lpa receptors  <cit> , and similarly to the situation in brain membranes and cryostat sections, gsno significantly inhibited lpa signaling in cho cell lysates without affecting the agonist potency . platelets offer another readily accessible model to study p2y12-gi  signaling in native cellular environments  <cit> . in human platelet membranes, gsno inhibited basal g protein activity by  <dig> ±  <dig> % . this effect was statistically significant. similar to the situation with brain p2y <dig> receptor signaling, gsno inhibited p2y <dig> receptor-dependent g protein activity in human platelet membranes, but had no effect on the agonist potency . to examine whether the receptor protein serves as a direct target of this action, human p2y <dig> receptor was stably transfected into cho cells. several cell lines responding to 2mesadp in gtpγs binding assays were established . however, neither gsno nor cysno affected the 2mesadp dose-response curves of any of the hp2y12-expressing cell lines . these data rule out the p2y <dig> receptor protein as a direct target of the rsno action.

the inhibitory effect of gsno on basal and p2y <dig> receptor-dependent g protein activity was not due to a nonspecific action on platelet membranes, since the signaling of another gi-linked platelet receptor, the α2a-adrenoceptor, was significantly amplified in gsno-treated membranes . this effect was not restricted to platelets, nor was it unique to the α2a-subtype, as signaling of the three human α2-adrenoceptor subtypes  was potentiated by gsno in cho cell lines stably expressing these receptors .

rsnos amplify muscarinic responses by increasing the rate of gdp/gtp exchange and the number of high-affinity gtp binding sites
the amplification of m2/m <dig> responses by rsnos was clearly evident in native brain tissue. further experiments were designed to address the mechanism of this action. results of these studies are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  a time-response study on basal and cch-stimulated gtpγs binding responses in forebrain membranes revealed that gsno accelerated the rate of gtpγs binding in agonist-stimulated conditions . in contrast, gsno had no effect on basal guanine nucleotide exchange. given that gdp release is generally thought to be the rate-limiting step in receptor-driven g protein activation, these data indicate that the amplifying effect of gsno on m2/m <dig> receptor-stimulated g protein activity is due to an accelerated rate of gdp/gtp exchange at the receptor-activated g protein α subunits. in line with this, gsno significantly increased the number of high-affinity gtpγs binding sites available for m2/m <dig> receptor activation under agonist-stimulated conditions  . in contrast, there were no statistical differences in the potency of gtpγs to displace gtpγs in any of the tested conditions  [log  ± se: basal-control - <dig>  ±  <dig> ; basal-gsno - <dig>  ±  <dig> ; cch-control - <dig>  ±  <dig> ; cch-gsno - <dig>  ±  <dig> ). these experiments indicate that rsnos amplify muscarinic receptor-stimulated g protein activity in native brain tissue by accelerating the rate by which agonist-occupied receptors can activate their cognate g proteins.

rsno amplification of m <dig> receptor responses are preserved under heterologous expression but the amplification is lost with constitutive receptor activity
to investigate the signaling of the human m <dig> receptor  under heterologous expression system, the receptor was stably transfected into cho cells. the effects of gsno on agonist-stimulated g protein activity were compared in rat forebrain membranes and three cell lines expressing the wild-type  hm <dig> receptor with increasing capability to activate g proteins. the results of these experiments are shown in figure  <dig>  and the potency and efficacy values are summarized in table  <dig>  in control conditions, cch stimulated gtpγs binding in the three wt-hm <dig> cell lines at a similar potency but varying efficacy  . gsno treatment significantly increased the emax in the two wt-hm <dig> cell lines  that showed comparable maximal responses to the values obtained in rat forebrain membranes . in contrast, the potentiating effect of gsno was lost in the wt-hm4-a <dig> cell line, where cch robustly activated g proteins . in contrast to the situation in brain membranes and other hm <dig> cell lines of this study, wt-hm4-a <dig> cell line exhibited constitutive activity, i.e. significant g protein activation was evident in the absence of added agonist. in this cell line, the machr antagonist, atropine, significantly inhibited basal g protein activity by  <dig> ±  <dig> %  . the effect was dose-dependent , indicating increased constitutive activation of wt-hm <dig> receptor in this cell line. collectively these experiments indicate that the potentiating effect of gsno on hm <dig> receptor responses was preserved under heterologous expression but that the effect was diminished with constitutive receptor activity.

the final experiments were intended to clarify whether cysteine  <dig> , located adjacent to the g protein-interacting dry-motif in the intracellular end of transmembrane helix  <dig> of the gi-coupled muscarinic receptors , could serve as the molecular target of rsno action. to this end, c <dig> was mutated into serine to reveal if the c133s mutation would abolish the effect of gsno on the efficacy of cch. however, gsno treatment significantly increased emax also in the mutant c133s-hm <dig> cell line , indicating that cysteine c <dig> of the hm <dig> receptor is not the specific target of rsnos. the mutation did not affect the potency of cch to activate g proteins via the hm <dig> receptor .

discussion
gtpγs autoradiography of brain cryostat sections revealed a highly receptor-specific modulation of gpcr signaling by rsnos in several receptor-enriched anatomical structures. this modulation was fully reversible upon addition of excess thiols. we have provided evidence indicating that s-nitrosylation, rather than other types of no reactions or the no – guanylyl cyclase – cgmp signaling pathway, was responsible for the observed effects. the rsnos effects were receptor-specific, as signaling of some receptors was markedly potentiated , whereas that of others was clearly inhibited , while signaling of other receptors was only marginally affected  by comparable treatments. we further demonstrated that rsnos can amplify m2/m <dig> receptor responses by increasing the rate of gdp/gtp exchange as well as the number of high-affinity g protein α subunits capable of interacting with the agonist-activated receptors. the potentiating effect of rsnos on hm <dig> receptor responses was preserved when this was studied in a heterologous expression system but was diminished in constitutively active hm <dig> receptors. we also demonstrated that the gpcr itself or its native signaling partners serve as potential targets of this modulation, as it was attenuated, or even lost, when receptor signaling was studied under heterologous expression. our study suggests that gpcr signaling is subject to a highly receptor-specific modulation by no-derived rsnos.

the gpcrs and their proximal signaling partners as likely targets of rsno action
since gtpγs binding assays monitor g protein activation, one of the earliest measurable steps in gpcr signal transduction, it is obvious that the molecular targets of rsno action are the receptors, their cognate g proteins and/or additional signaling partners, whose thiol modification can directly regulate guanine nucleotide binding and hence g protein activation.

it is interesting that rsno treatment of brain sections consistently resulted in thiol-sensitive increases in basal gi protein activity throughout the gray matter regions. however, no such effect was present in brain membrane gtpγs binding assays, nor was it detected in cho cell membranes but in platelet membranes, rsnos inhibited basal g protein activity by ~20%. as receptor input should be minimal in basal conditions, the differential behavior of rsnos in cryostat sections and various membrane preparations likely reflects direct action on the gi proteins and/or their proximal regulatory partners. it has been known for some time that g proteins can serve as direct targets of ros, including no  <cit> . exogenous no donors stimulate the monomeric g protein p21ras via s-nitrosylation to a single cysteine residue  <cit> . furthermore, gαi and gαo serve as direct protein targets of ros, and they can be activated in the absence of input from the gpcrs  <cit> . specifically, ros were shown to modify two cysteine residues of gαi/o and this modification accelerated gdp release from gα with a concomitant increase in the formation of the gtp-bound form of gα without receptor activation  <cit> . furthermore, gsno was reported to stimulate basal g protein activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  <cit> . the rsno-elicited increase in basal g protein activity in brain sections is consistent with these findings. however, it is not clear why no such stimulation was detected in bulk membrane preparations. one explanation could be the differential accessibility of target thiol in cryostat sections as compared to membrane preparations. it is reasonable to assume that thiol accessibility in the former situation is close to natural. it is also possible that some crucial regulatory component of the signaling machinery is lost in bulk membrane preparations. since several high-speed centrifugation steps were employed to obtain the relatively pure membrane preparation used in our study, this possibility should not be underestimated. this could also explain why rsnos had no effect on basal g protein activity in cho cell membranes, although several members of the gi family, including gαi1/ <dig>  gαi <dig>  and gαo, are endogenously present in these cells  <cit> .

in platelet membranes, rsnos inhibited both basal and p2y <dig> receptor-dependent g protein activity, but clearly potentiated α2a-adrenoceptor responses. platelet p2y <dig> receptors couple to gαi <dig>  <cit> , whereas α2a-adrenoceptors can communicate via gαz, at least in the mouse  <cit> . collectively these data suggest that rsnos inhibit both basal and receptor-stimulated gαi <dig> activity in the platelets. it is not yet known whether brain p2y <dig> receptors couple to this particular g protein subtype. further, it is unclear whether lpa receptors in brain and cho cells communicate via gαi <dig>  it is interesting that rsnos inhibited the signaling of all three receptors in native tissues. in addition, we found that brain cannabinoid cb <dig> receptor signaling was inhibited by rsnos. a previous study reported that pulmonary vasoconstriction by serotonin was also inhibited by gsno  <cit> .

although the basic module of gpcr signaling is traditionally considered to be the receptor, its cognate g protein, and the effector, recent studies have identified a wide range of proteins that can directly interact with the receptor and/or g proteins. these can modulate signaling efficiency, cellular localization, or the regulation of the gpcrs or g proteins  <cit> . one such recently-identified protein is the brain-enriched, ras-related monomeric g protein dexras <dig> . dexras1/ags <dig> is physiologically activated upon nmda receptor-stimulated no synthesis and s-nitrosylation on cysteine c <dig>  <cit> . dexras1/ags- <dig> also interacts with gαi/gαo, and can activate gpcr signaling systems independently of receptor input  <cit> . interestingly, dexras1/ags- <dig> was shown to proximally antagonize the signaling of m <dig> achrs and formyl peptide receptors, possibly by altering the pool of g proteins available for receptor coupling and/or disruption of a preformed signaling complex  <cit> . it is currently unknown whether rsnos and/or s-nitrosylation could alter the ability of dexras1/ags- <dig> to modify g protein function and/or input from the gpcrs. in light of the present findings, this should be an attractive hypothesis for future studies.

most gα proteins are palmitoylated at a cysteine near the amino terminus and this modification is required for g protein targeting to lipid rafts  <cit>  and/or normal signaling  <cit> . addition and removal of the palmitoyl group appear to be dynamic receptor-mediated processes that may contribute to recycling of gα between the membrane and cytosolic compartments  <cit> . since our experiments used only nonliving tissue, it is unlikely that the rsno actions would achieve such extensive lipid modifications, although such alterations reportedly occur after exposure of living cells to no  <cit> .

functional implications
specialized plasma membrane microdomains act as unique platforms with specific enrichment of gpcrs, their signaling partners, and the enzymatic machinery for no biosynthesis  <cit> . such close proximity of the gpcr signaling complex and no source is particularly relevant for many of the receptors whose signaling was shown here to be reversibly modulated by rsnos.

in the heart, endothelial nos  is localized n caveolin-enriched myocyte membrane fractions and it has been shown that lipid draft-disrupting agents severely compromise no-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase types  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . m2-mediated parasympathetic cardiac signaling also critically involves enos activation and no production  <cit> . on the other hand, caveolar sequestration of m <dig> receptors and no signaling was shown to be finely tuned in the myocytes  <cit> , suggesting a dynamic interplay between the m <dig> receptor and no. in hm <dig> expressing cho cells, snp induced agonist-independent internalization of the receptor via atropine- and thiol-sensitive mechanisms  <cit> . furthermore, ros including no, potentiate cardiac m <dig> receptor signaling via poorly defined mechanisms  <cit> . consistent with these findings, our study revealed robust amplification of m2/m <dig> receptor signaling by rsnos both in the brain and in cho cells expressing the hm <dig> receptor. in cho cells, however, the rsno effect clearly diminished with increasing constitutive receptor activity, suggesting that rsno action and constitutive receptor activity likely share common mechanisms, including accelerated gdp/gtp exchange in cognate gα subunits. as far as we are aware, this is the first study to show robust, and highly region-specific amplification of m2/m <dig> receptor signaling in discrete anatomical loci of the central nervous system. the functional consequences of these findings remain to be established.

the p2y <dig> receptor plays a central role in platelet activation and aggregation  <cit> . previous studies have indicated that endothelial and platelet-derived no, as well as exogenous rsnos, are potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation  <cit> . both cgmp-dependent and -independent mechanisms and several potential molecular targets have been implicated in these effects  <cit> . a previous report provided evidence for cgmp-mediated signaling in the inhibition of platelet gi signaling  <cit> . the present study adds further dimensions to this scheme by demonstrating that rsnos can inhibit platelet  p2y <dig> receptor function via cgmp-independent mechanisms, likely involving s-nitrosylation. however, since the effect was lost in cho cells stably expressing the hp2y <dig> receptor, the native signaling partners, rather than the p2y <dig> receptor, serve as obvious targets of this action.

one of the novel findings in this study was that rsnos strongly inhibited gi-mediated lpa receptor signaling in the brain and in cho cells. the relevance of this finding with respect to brain lpa <dig> receptor signaling remains to be established. in vivo, peripheral lpa receptor signaling is closely associated with no. in bovine aortic endothelial cells, lpa stimulates endothelial nos via gi-coupled lpa receptors  <cit> . lpa is released from activated platelets and this stimulates other platelets to activate aggregation processes  <cit> . inhibition of lpa signaling via endogenous rsnos could be one important mechanism by which endothelium-derived no can suppress lpa-mediated athero- and thrombogenic signaling.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study revealed that g protein activation, an early step of gpcr signal transduction, is subject to a reversible and highly receptor-specific modulation by exogenous rsnos at physiologically relevant concentrations. since nos synthases  have been shown to reside in close proximity with the gpcr signaling machinery, especially for many of the receptors whose signaling is subject to modulation by exogenous rsnos, these findings suggest that gpcr signaling in vivo is likely to be finely tuned by no-derived rsno species. future studies should aim at pinpointing the precise molecular targets of these actions, and at understanding the specific modifications  involved, as well as revealing the physiological and/or pathophysiological relevance in vivo.
