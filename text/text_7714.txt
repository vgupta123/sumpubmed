BACKGROUND
mads-box genes play important roles in many aspects of plant development  <cit> . they are the major components in the well-known ‘abc’ model that describes their roles in floral organ development  <cit> . mads-box genes were identified initially as floral homeotic genes and are some of the most extensively studied transcription factors  involved in developmental control  <cit> . mads-box proteins are characterized by the presence in the n-terminal region of a conserved mads-box dna-binding domain of approximately 58– <dig> amino acids that binds to so-called carg boxes   <cit> .

plant mads-box genes have been subdivided into two main groups viz. m-type, also designated as type i, and mikc, also known as type ii  <cit> . the m-type mads-box genes are grouped into mα, mβ and mγ based on phylogenetic relationships within their mads-box regions  <cit> . the mikc genes are characterized by the presence of keratin-like  domain and are classified as either mikcc or mikc*-type  <cit> . the mikcc genes are further partitioned into  <dig> clades based on phylogeny  <cit> .

mikc-type proteins generally contain four common domains. in addition to the mads  domain, mikc proteins contain intervening , k and c-terminal  domains  <cit> . the i domain is relatively less conserved, and contributes to the dna binding specificity and dimerization of these proteins  <cit> . the k domain is characterized by a coiled-coil structure that mainly functions in the dimerization of mads-box proteins. the k domain, which is present in mikc mads-box proteins but absent from m-type proteins, is more highly conserved than the i domain  <cit> , and the mikc* group has longer i domains and less conserved k domains than the mikcc group  <cit> . the c domain, which is the least conserved, plays important roles in transcriptional activation and the formation of multimeric mads-box protein complexes  <cit> .

the most remarkable feature of the mads-box gene family is the divergent functions of its members in different aspects of plant growth and development, such as flowering time control, meristem identity, floral organ identity, formation of the dehiscence zone, fruit ripening, embryo development and the development of vegetative organs such as roots and leaves  <cit> . previous reports revealed the role of mikcc in reproductive organ development of higher plants, and this has been the well-characterized group of mads-box proteins in plants. to date, mikcc genes have been found to play fundamental roles in flowering time , flc <dig> , agl <dig> , maf1/flm  and svp ;  <cit> ); floral meristem identity , ful  and cal ;  <cit> ); the formation of floral organs , ap <dig> , pi  and ag ;  <cit> ); fruit ripening  and ful;  <cit> ) and seed pigmentation and embryo development ;  <cit> ).

the biological functions of mikcc genes in flower organogenesis can be grouped into five classes, a, b, c, d and e, which are required in different combinations to specify the identity of sepals , petals , stamens , carpels  and ovules   <cit> . expression of mikcc genes has also been detected outside reproductive organs, e.g., of genes belonging to the agl <dig> and agl <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . this expression suggested a role for those genes in vegetative development, which was later demonstrated for some of them in root development. nevertheless, agl <dig> and agl <dig> have been proposed to play roles as flowering promoters  <cit> . by contrast, m-type  mads-box genes in arabidopsis appear to function exclusively during female gametophyte and seed development  <cit> .

the genus brassica includes a number of important crops that provide oil, vegetables, condiments, dietary fiber, and vitamin c  <cit> . among brassica species, brassica rapa comprises several subspecies, including chinese cabbage , non-heading chinese cabbage  and turnip . chinese cabbage is one of the most important vegetables in asia. in addition, b. rapa is used as the model species representing the brassica ‘a’ genome and, therefore, was selected for genome sequencing  <cit> . this species has already proven a useful model for studying polyploidy, in part because it has a relatively small genome  compared to other brassica species. comparative genomic analysis confirmed that b. rapa underwent genome triplication since its divergence from arabidopsis  <cit> . mads-box family genes have been thoroughly studied in its close relative arabidopsis, but have not been characterized in the relatively large and complex genome of b. rapa. over the course of evolution, the number of genes in this family steadily increased as the reproductive system became more complex; concomitant with this expansion of the lineage, mads-box genes have been found to perform more diversified functions  <cit> . in addition to growth and development-related functions, some stress-responsive mads-box genes have also been reported in wheat and rice  <cit> . as an important vegetable crop world-wide, brassica species are subject to a variety of abiotic stresses. identification of stress-resistance-related mads-box genes in brassica could be highly useful.

the recent sequencing of the brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis genome  <cit>  offers the possibility of genome-wide analysis of mads-box genes. in this study, we analyzed the genomic localization, protein motif structure, phylogenetic relationships, and gene structure of all candidate mads-box genes in b. rapa. we carried out extensive expression profiling for specific mikcc subfamilies in vegetative and reproductive organs, as well as during flower developmental stages. additionally, we investigated a considerable number of mads-box genes, selected from whole-genome, low temperature-treated microarray data in the cold-tolerant and -susceptible inbred lines of b. rapa, chiifu and kenshin, respectively.

RESULTS
identification and sequence analysis of mads-box genes in b. rapa
a set of  <dig> candidate mads-box genes from the b. rapa genome was recovered using key word ‘mads-box’ to search swissprot annotations at the brassica database    <cit> . this number of candidates b. rapa  is higher than the number of mads-box genes in arabidopsis, rice, soybean, maize and sorghum   <cit> . a domain search using embl  with the corresponding b. rapa candidate protein sequences confirmed  <dig> of them to contain a ‘mads’ domain, whereas the other  <dig> did not. the five candidates  that lacked a ‘mads’ domain shared considerable sequence similarity with mads-box proteins of other crop species that also lack ‘mads’ domains and are considered to be mads-box proteins . we classified all  <dig> putative b. rapa mads-box proteins into five classes  in accord with the previously reported classification of the mads-box family members in flowering plants  <cit> . we designated the  <dig> annotated mads-box genes of b. rapa as brmads followed by arabic numbers 1– <dig>  consecutively following the five classes . subsequent sequence analysis of the  <dig> genes showed open reading frame  ranging from  <dig> to 2379 bp and predicted protein lengths from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid . sequence analysis also revealed that b. rapa mikc  mads-box genes usually contained multiple introns, with a maximum of  <dig> introns; the exceptions were brmads <dig>  brmads <dig> and brmads <dig>  which did not have any introns. almost all of the m-type  genes lacked introns or had only a single intron; however, m-type mads-box genes brmads <dig> and brmads <dig> had  <dig> and  <dig> introns respectively . these features are consistent with those of mads-box genes in other flowering plants such as arabidopsis, rice, grapevine, and soybean  <cit> .table  <dig>

phylogenetic analysis of mads-box genes in b. rapa
independent phylogenetic trees for m-type and mikc-type mads-box tfs were constructed using the b. rapa mads-box proteins along with those from arabidopsis and rice. there were 67 m-type members  from b. rapa, with the other  <dig> proteins belonging to mikc-type . notably, the mikcc family included  <dig> members of this latter group, more than in arabidopsis, rice, and soybean . among the  <dig> mikcc genes, brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> could not be assigned in the tree using the bootstrap method with  <dig> replicates, possibly due to high sequence divergence in the conserved regions and sequence length. to test their relationships and relevance with other mads-box genes, we generated an alternative phylogenetic tree without using bootstrap replications and found these five genes in the different clades of mikcc .figure  <dig>

, arabidopsis and rice.  phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> type i mads-box proteins from b. rapa , arabidopsis  and rice .  phylogenetic analysis of type ii b. rapa, rice and arabidopsis mads-box proteins.  <dig> type ii mads-box proteins from b. rapa , arabidopsis  and rice  showing  <dig> mikcc clades and mikc* group as marked in the figure.



in accordance with the known classes of arabidopsis mads-box genes, we found  <dig> mikcc clades in b. rapa. although most of the b. rapa mads-box genes were consistent with arabidopsis in terms of sequence similarity and grouping, we found some genes viz. brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  that were placed as close sisters of rice mads-box genes in the tree. interestingly, osmads <dig>  instead of being included in the agl15-like clade, paired with brmads <dig> in the tm <dig> clade. there was some disparity in the distribution of rice mβ genes between the two phylogenetic trees prepared with the different methods . among the  <dig> mikcc clades, the tm <dig> clade contained the most b. rapa sequences . the flc clade included three previously identified flc genes of b. rapa viz. brflc <dig>  brflc <dig>  brflc <dig>  <cit>  which showed  <dig> ,  <dig> and 100% similarity to brmads <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively at the amino acid level. mikc*/mδ included  <dig> members, which is almost double that in arabidopsis , rice  and soybean .

in case of type i mads-box proteins, the mα and mγ groups had more members in b. rapa , than in arabidopsis, rice and soybean. by contrast, the  <dig> mβ genes found in b. rapa was less than that in arabidopsis, but more than in rice and soybean   <cit> .

analysis of conserved motifs in mads-box proteins of b. rapa
ten conserved motifs among related proteins were identified from the  <dig> candidate mads-box genes of b. rapa using the meme  motif search tool . motifs  <dig> and  <dig> specifying the mads domain were found in  <dig> members of the mads-box family whereas brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> did not show either motif  <dig> or  <dig> characteristic of the mads domain. these proteins did contain other representative motifs of mads-box family such as motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the mikc mads-box proteins exhibited only the motif  <dig> type mads domain. among m-type mads-box proteins , most mα and mγ proteins had motif 1-type mads domains, although brmads <dig> and  <dig> contained motif  <dig>  conversely, most of the mβ proteins  had the motif 6-type mads domain.figure  <dig>

mads-box type ii proteins using meme motif search tool for each group  given separately. different motifs are indicated by different colors, and the names of all members are shown on the left side of the figure. the order of the motifs corresponds to the position of the motifs in individual protein sequences.



conserved motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> specified the k domain, which is characteristic of mikc mads-box proteins, were found in varying combinations in most mikcc proteins, except brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  mikc* proteins were found to contain the k-domain motifs  less frequently than did mikcc proteins . comparatively less conserved motifs  <dig> and  <dig> representative of the i domain were found in both m-type and mikc mads-box proteins. mβ and mγ type proteins contained i domains at lower frequencies as compared to members of the other groups. a considerable number of non-mikc proteins, especially from the mα group, showed partial k domain motifs. finally, motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> representing the c-terminal domains were also weakly conserved among b. rapa mads-box genes. motif  <dig> was restricted to  <dig> mikcc and  <dig> mikc* proteins. all mγ proteins except brmads <dig> and  <dig> consistently showed both the c-terminal-representing motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  motif  <dig> and  <dig> were limited to only m-type mads-box proteins. the mα group showed motif  <dig>  but motif  <dig> was exclusively present in the mγ proteins. the mβ group showed an interesting pattern, wherein  <dig> genes contained only a single motif, specifically one representative of the ‘mads’ domain. only  <dig> mβ genes out of  <dig> had more than two full or partial motifs .

syntenic relationships between mads-box genes of b. rapa and arabidopsis
polyploidy  has played a vital role in the evolution and genetic diversity of angiosperm genomes  <cit> . wgd events are generally followed by changes in gene expression and widespread gene loss  <cit> . the brassica genus is closely related to the model species a. thaliana and both are members of the brassicaceae family. comparative genetic and physical mapping as well as genome sequencing studies have authenticated the syntenic relationships between the arabidopsis genome and the triplicate genome of b. rapa, with subgenomes having evolved by genome fractionation  <cit> . comparative analysis was conducted to identify homologous mads-box transcription factors between b. rapa and arabidopsis. based on our phylogenetic results and blastx reconfirmation, we determined which arabidopsis mads-box genes were orthologous to the  <dig> mads-box b. rapa homologs. among the homologous gene sets, we found that most arabidopsis mads-box genes were represented by one to three copies of b. rapa mads-box genes .

chromosomal location of mads-box genes and their genomic duplication in b. rapa
we mapped the physical locations of the mads-box genes on the  <dig> chromosomes of b. rapa . the highest numbers of mads-box genes were found on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , while chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> contained the fewest . among the five types of mads-box genes, mikc* and mγ genes were clustered along chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  respectively. a high of  <dig> mikcc genes was found on chromosome  <dig>  but other than that there was no bias was observed in the distribution of mikcc, mα or mβ genes . duplication analysis revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> mads-box genes  were present in two or more copies. this gene duplication occurred as a result of tandem and segment duplications. a total of  <dig> mads-box genes were found to have counterparts on duplicated segments. we observed, higher frequencies of segmental duplications generated many homologs of mads-box genes along all chromosomes of b. rapa . conversely, lower frequencies of tandem duplications were evident among m-type b. rapa mads-box genes. only  <dig> tandemly duplicated genes  were found on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  evolutionary analysis of b. rapa also validated our findings, wherein only 14% of the b. rapa genes were tandem duplicates, compared with 27% of arabidopsis genes in a 100-kbp window interval  <cit> . no large gene clusters or hot spots for b. rapa mads-box genes were identified, possibly due to the very few tandem duplications.figure  <dig>

transcript analysis of b. rapa mads-box genes during organ development
mads-box genes have been found to be involved primarily in floral organ specification; although some recent studies revealed their involvement in other processes as well. specifically, mikcc proteins among all the mads-box groups have been found to have diverse functions related to plant growth and development  <cit> . we therefore examined the expression of all  <dig> b. rapa mikcc genes in root, stem, leaf and flower buds. we also investigated these genes in the sepal, petal, stamen and pistil of b. rapa flower which had expressions only in the flower buds. and, we discussed the expression of all mikcc genes here in accord with thirteen clades identified in our study. additionally, we included all mikc* genes in the four floral tissue expression study as they have been reported to be involved in the development of reproductive organs  <cit> . finally, we conducted an expression study in six flower bud developmental stages  for selected mikcc genes  and all mikc* genes to justify their roles during the flower bud development .figure  <dig> 
organ specific expression analysis of 100
mikc brmads
according to phylogenetic grouping  are showing in the root , stem , leaf , flower bud , sepal , petal , stamen , pistil  and six flower growth stages of
b. rapa
.




agl15-like genes
it has been reported that agl <dig> in arabidopsis strongly delays abscission and senescence in reproductive tissues  <cit> . the b. rapa genome has nine agl15-like genes  and their expression in different tissues was consistent with that of their closest arabidopsis homologs. all of the genes had predominant expression in flower buds while a few of them were expressed at low levels in different vegetative tissues .

flc-like genes
flc acts as an inhibitor of flowering and is a convergence point for environmental and endogenous pathways that regulate flowering time in arabidopsis  <cit> . we found ten flc homologs  in b. rapa with very similar expression patterns in most organs. brmads <dig> is a distant member of this subfamily and showed strong expression in the four tissues tested. our root expression results for brflc <dig> and brflc <dig> contrast with those previously reported  <cit> . this might be due to varietal differences of b. rapa between the two studies. brmads <dig> is the only member of this subfamily that was not expressed in any of the organ tissues .

agl17-like genes
the agl17-like genes show unusually diverse expression patterns, with members being expressed in roots , in pollen , in both , or in leaf guard cells and trichomes   <cit> . we identified six agl17-like genes  and found expression primarily in roots of b. rapa like their arabidopsis counterparts. additionally, they were expressed in flower buds like in other eudicots  <cit> . we also observed low expression in stem and leaf tissues .

stmads11-like genes
genes of this clade perform contrasting roles in flower development. svp  functions as a floral repressor, whereas agl <dig> belongs to the same subfamily but promotes flowering in arabidopsis  <cit> . we identified four genes  in this subfamily and detected their widespread expression in the four organs of b. rapa . this is in contrast to the expression of svp in arabidopsis, which is restricted to leaves and shoots  <cit> .

ggm13-like genes
the ggm13-like genes are expected to represent a sister group of the b genes and hence are termed bsister  genes  <cit> . abs/tt <dig> is the only arabidopsis ggm13-like gene and has been shown to function in the specification of endothelial cells as well as in the control of flavonoid biosynthesis in the seed coat  <cit> . we identified three ggm13-like genes , with expression exclusively in the flower buds like their arabidopsis counterparts. all three were expressed in the female reproductive organ of b. rapa flowers, whereas brmads <dig> was also expressed in the male reproductive organ. interestingly, transcript accumulation of all ggm13-like genes gradually decreased from early to mature bud stage of flower development .

glo and def-like genes
these genes are b class floral homeotic genes in eudicots and are involved in specifying petals and stamens during flower development  <cit> . we found three glo-like genes  and two def-like genes  that were expressed exclusively in the flower buds. transcripts for these genes were abundant in the petals and stamens of b. rapa flowers. we also found low expression in sepals and pistils .

agl12-like genes
three agl12-like genes  with preferential expression in roots were detected in b. rapa. brmads <dig> and  <dig> were also expressed in the flower buds, similar to their arabidopsis counterpart agl <dig> with the exception that agl <dig> has also been detected in shoots .

tm3-like genes
these genes are expressed preferentially in vegetative parts of other plant species  <cit> . soc <dig> is an important member of this family expressed abundantly in the apical meristem and acting as a flowering time regulator  <cit> . we identified eighteen tm3-like genes  with variable expression patterns in vegetative and reproductive parts of b. rapa. brmads <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are close homologs of soc <dig> and were primarily expressed in stem, leaf and flower buds. moreover, we found brmads <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to be expressed primarily in roots, but unlike their arabidopsis counterparts , we detected their expression in other parts of the plant as well .

ag-like genes
genes of this clade are mainly involved in specifying stamen and carpel identity, and in providing floral determinacy  <cit> . we identified eight agamous-like  genes  that were expressed exclusively in flower buds of b. rapa. our results are consistent with those for the arabidopsis ag subfamily, members of which specify stamen and carpel identity  <cit> . some of these b. rapa genes were pistil specific  and some were expressed in both male and female reproductive organs  .

squa-like genes
squa-like genes are typically expressed in inflorescence or floral meristems, and most of them function as meristem identity genes  <cit> . in addition, they are involved in specifying sepals and petals and thus are class ‘a’ floral organ identity genes  <cit> . we identified ten squa-like genes  that had variable transcript patterns, but were expressed mainly in flower buds like their arabidopsis counterparts. some brmads squa-like genes showed strong expression in the stem and leaf as well. our results in this case are also consistent with the gu et al. findings, where they detected the squa-like gene ‘fruitfull’ in stems and leaves of arabidopsis  <cit> . brmads <dig> was the only member of this subfamily expressed in all tested organ tissues of b. rapa .

agl6-like genes
the functions of agl6-like genes are not clear. we isolated three agl6-like genes  from b. rapa with expression in the flower buds, like their arabidopsis counterparts agl <dig> and agl <dig>  brmads <dig> and  <dig>  unlike their close homolog agl <dig>  also showed expression in vegetative tissues .

agl2-like genes
these genes play a central role in the floral meristem and floral organ development  <cit> . they constitute an additional class of floral homeotic genes, termed as class e genes  <cit> . ten agl2-like  genes from b. rapa showed expression primarily in reproductive tissues. brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were also expressed in the stem and leaf, and brmads <dig> alone had additional very low expression in roots .

brmikc* genes
there were eleven mikc* genes  that were placed apart from the other mikc genes in the phylogeny. most of these genes were found to be expressed exclusively in the stamens, except in the case of brmads <dig> and  <dig>  that were detected in the four floral organ tissues. moreover, these genes showed differential expression in six flower bud developmental stages . brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were preferentially expressed in the young bud stage while their expression gradually decreased until to the mature bud stage. the rest of the genes exhibited widespread expression mainly in the early stages of bud development. however, two mikc* genes  appeared to be nonfunctional, as they were not expressed in any stage of bud development or in any floral organ tissues .

microarray expression against cold and freezing stress
four weeks old seedlings of two inbred lines of b. rapa, chiifu and kenshin, were treated with cold and freezing stresses  during 2 hours and the expression of the  <dig> mads-box genes were subsequently analyzed using microarrays. chiifu originated in temperate regions, whereas kenshin originated in subtropical and tropical regions and therefore, these two lines are expected to respond differently against cold and freezing stresses. only  <dig> mads-box genes from different groups showed differential cold- or freezing-responsive expression between the two lines , while the remaining  <dig> genes showed very low or no expression . among the  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> mikcc genes showed varying levels of expression, with brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> displaying similar expression patterns in response to cold and freezing. brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed at different levels than the aforementioned four mikcc genes in both lines of b. rapa. brmads <dig> and  <dig>  two mikcc genes, were expressed at low levels in chiifu throughout the stress period, while in kenshin they showed constitutive expression. by contrast, three genes from the mα group  showed differential expression within and between the two lines, with chiifu exhibiting higher expression than kenshin. notably, two mγ genes  showed higher responsiveness in kenshin than in chiifu upon exposure to cold and freezing temperatures .figure  <dig>

qpcr expression of mads-box genes against abiotic stress
one of our main objectives was to identify mads-box genes that might show stress responsiveness in addition to having different growth functions. at first, a qpcr experiment was conducted to validate the cold and freezing responsiveness of the  <dig> brmads genes which were selected from the microarray analysis. we observed their expression patterns and found them consistent with the microarray results in most of the cases. only two genes  were found to show their expressions differently from those in the microarray experiment . however, for a better understanding of gene expression in response to three abiotic stresses  in a time course basis  we again selected two inbred lines of b. rapa, chiifu and kenshin. leaf and root tissues of stress treated b. rapa were examined for qpcr expression analysis. besides cold stress, we also examined the salt and drought responsiveness of the same mads-box genes. arora et al. found mads-box genes involved in responses to multiple stresses  <cit> . the  <dig> differentially expressed mads-box genes from the whole-genome low temperature-treated data set were selected for qpcr experiments . in chiifu, brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed differential expression in response to cold stress, wherein they were up-regulated from 0 h to 1 h and down-regulated at 4 h-8 h. subsequently, all genes were up-regulated from 8 h to 24 h and exhibited their highest expression at 24 h , followed by a down-regulation at 48 h. apart from these, brmads <dig> showed the highest expression at 30 m, after which it followed the same expression patterns as the others. conversely, in kenshin, brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were up- regulated at early hours of stress after which they showed down-regulation and eventually became inactive at later stages of cold stress. brmads <dig>  and  <dig> in kenshin exhibited 19- and 12-fold higher expression respectively than the control throughout the stress period and, more interestingly, expression of these two genes in chiifu was far below that in kenshin. notably, from the thirteen cold responsive brmads genes eleven were form mikcc group. more specifically, among these genes, three  were from flc-like clade, one  from agl17-like clade, two  from stmads-like clade and five  from tm3-like clade .figure  <dig>

. the error bars represent the standard error of the means of three independent replicates. values denoted by the same letter did not differ significantly at p <  <dig>  according to duncan’s multiple range tests.



during salt stress, brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in chiifu were up-regulated up to 1 h, showed down-regulation in the mid-stage of stress and were up-regulated again at later stages. brmads <dig> was alternatively up and down-regulated up to 12 h and afterwards it showed down-regulation from 24 h - 48 h. in kenshin, these same six mads-box genes were induced early in salt treatment  and down-regulated for the rest of the period .

in the case of drought stress, brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were expressed differentially in both chiifu and kenshin. six genes  in chiifu were up-regulated at 30 m after administering drought stress, while brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated from 4 h - 8 h. brmads <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated at early stage, after which brmads <dig> was up-regulated from 4 h - 12 h and down-regulated again from 24 h - 48 h. after 30 m, brmads <dig> remained static except at 24 h when it was induced more than  <dig> fold. by contrast, these six mads-box genes in kenshin were down-regulated soon after drought treatment and remained that way throughout the stress period. though brmads <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed up-regulation at an early stage, they eventually became inactive for the rest of the period .

discussion
duplication among mikc genes seems to have played major role in the expansion of mads-box genes in b. rapa
in this study, we have reported  <dig> mads-box genes of b. rapa, which is higher in number than the mads-box genes in arabidopsis   <cit> . the whole genome of b. rapa underwent triplication events since its divergence from arabidopsis  <cit> . thus, evolutionary relationship between b. rapa and arabidopsis is also supportive to our findings. on the other hand, we observed the expansion of mikc and m-type genes in these two linages. we found some disparity on the duplication events between the mikc and m-type genes of b. rapa and arabidopsis. for example, duplication events took place with higher frequency among mikc-type b. rapa mads-box genes compared to m-type genes. and, in case of arabidopsis this scenario was reverse, where more number of m-type genes than mikc genes was found in the duplicated segments. more specifically,  <dig> mikc genes were found in duplicated segments of b. rapa . this might be related to the fact that there are more pseudogenes of m-type than of mikc-type mads-box genes in the arabidopsis genome and they experienced faster birth and death rates than mikc type  <cit> . although the b. rapa genome is triplicated relative to that of arabidopsis, the number of m-type genes in b. rapa is almost the same as in arabidopsis . we speculate this might be due to the presence of many non-functional m-type genes  that remained inactive and were not duplicated or were deleted from the b. rapa genome. mikc-type genes have functioned in growth and development of plants since their evolution and after multiple duplication events in b. rapa, mikc-type genes appear to have functionally differentiated in a relatively short time and been maintained as functional genes in the genome to perform more complex functions flower and organ development.

involvement of mads-box genes in organ development of b. rapa
role in reproductive organ development
investigations regarding the genetic and molecular basis of floral development in the model eudicots arabidopsis and antirrhinum have revealed the involvement of a number of mads-box genes in specifying floral organ identity  <cit> . the high degree of sequence identity and remarkably conserved genome structure between arabidopsis and brassica genomes enables comparison of crop genomics among the brassica complex  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the arabidopsis mads-box homologs in b. rapa that play specific roles in flower development. consideration of the abcde model of flower development in b. rapa revealed extensive similarities with that of arabidopsis and other higher plants.

all squa-like genes in b. rapa were typically expressed in the flower buds like their arabidopsis counterparts. ap <dig> is involved in specifying sepals and petals as class a floral organ identity gene  <cit> . our results also suggest that brmads <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as putative orthologs of ap <dig> might play similar role, and they have sepal- and petal-specific expression in b. rapa flowers .

regarding the b class genes in b. rapa, we found five close homologs of arabidopsis pistillata  and apetala <dig>  that showed distinct expression in male reproductive organs but not female reproductive organs. besides being involved in the male and female reproductive parts, these genes were also recruited for petal identity in arabidopsis  <cit> . we also found petal expression for them in b. rapa flowers.

genes involved in c and d functions are from the monophyletic ag subfamily. all ag family genes in b. rapa had higher expression in female organs than in male. c and d class genes like stk/agl <dig>  shatterproof <dig> , and shp <dig>  are together required for ovule identity  <cit> . close homologs of sep  genes from the agl2-like subfamily in b. rapa showed widespread expression mainly in the aboveground parts; this is suggestive of their involvement in organ development. pelaz et al. studied triple mutants of arabidopsis sep family genes  and found that their redundant functions are required for petal, stamen and carpel development and to prevent indeterminate growth of the flower meristem  <cit> . genes of this family have been identified in fruits during the ripening stage of grapevine  <cit> . similarly, two tomato sep genes, tm <dig> and lemadsrin, appear to play roles in tomato fruit development  <cit> . the agl <dig> subfamily has three members in b. rapa, two in poplar and one each in arabidopsis and grapevine. genes from this subfamily have found to play roles in the regulation of cell cycle in root meristems and as promoters of flowering transition through up-regulation of soc <dig>  flowering locus t  and leafy   <cit> .

we found both reproductive and vegetative expression of agl <dig> subfamily genes in b. rapa, as in arabidopsis, whereas they were restricted to the flower buds, flowers and fruits in grapevine  <cit> . agl <dig> and agl <dig> are proposed to function as repressors of floral transition, acting upstream of ft and probably in combination with other floral repressors like svp or flc  <cit> . our results regarding agl17-like genes correspond with their expression in arabidopsis, where they are expressed primarily in roots, which indicate that they might function in b. rapa root development. the flower bud expression of the agl17-like genes in b. rapa is also consistent with the assumption of a flowering promoter role for agl <dig>  which could participate in the photoperiodic induction of ap <dig> and lfy independent of ft  <cit> .

predominant expression of b. rapa mikc* genes in the young bud stage demonstrates their importance in male reproductive organ development. our results contrast with those for atmikc*, for which verelst el al. reported predominant expression during late stages  of pollen development  <cit> .

predominant expression of three tt <dig> homologs  in the early stage of female reproductive growth demonstrates their importance in the development of this organ . these findings are similar to that of a previous investigation in arabidopsis, where ggm13-like gene expression was observed in female reproductive organs, especially in ovules, which is also consistent with the situation in gymnosperms and other angiosperms  <cit> . moreover, tt <dig> from arabidopsis is the only ggm13-like gene for which a mutant phenotype is known. analysis of this mutant revealed that tt <dig> is involved in the specification of endothelial cells and control of flavonoid biosynthesis in seed coat  <cit> .

role of mads-box genes in vegetative tissue development
transcription of a number of mads-box genes outside flowers and fruits as well as an increasing number of mutant and transgenic flowering plants suggest that members of this gene family play regulatory roles during vegetative development also, such as in embryo, root and leaf development  <cit> . the existence of mads-box genes in gymnosperms, ferns, and mosses, which do not form flowers or fruits, further demonstrates the role of these genes in plants is not restricted to flower or fruit development  <cit> .

all homologs from the agl17-like clade in the b. rapa genome were predominantly expressed in roots and some of them were detected in stem and leaf tissues as well. reports from different studies indicate that agl17-like genes show unusually diverse expression patterns in roots, pollen, leaf guard cells and trichomes. it is likely that the ancestral agl17-like gene had an expression domain restricted to vegetative tissues  <cit> .

in arabidopsis, agl <dig> and agl <dig> showed high expression in roots, flowers, siliques, and significant expression was also observed in stem and leaves. moreover, agl <dig> was detected up to the heart stage of embryo development but not in the developing embryos at any stage  <cit> . accordingly, we can also predict that brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in b. rapa, as putative orthologs of agl <dig>  might play roles in vegetative tissue development.

tm3-like genes in arabidopsis  have been reported to function in the roots   <cit> . soc <dig>  a floral pathway integrator, expressed most abundantly in aboveground parts, is repressed by another mads-box gene, the floral transition repressor flc, which is involved in vernalization  <cit> .

the ubiquitous expression of some b. rapa flc genes corresponds to that of their arabidopsis homologs. kim et al. reported that the expression of three brflc genes  was associated with flowering time and concluded that brflc genes act similarly to atflc and ultimately help in controlling of flowering time in b. rapa and other crops as well to produce higher vegetative yields  <cit> .

the ubiquitous expression of b. rapa stmads11-like genes suggests that these might be good candidates to play regulatory roles. reports on stmads <dig> genes from different crops demonstrated that they play important roles in developing vegetative tissues. for example, jointless, a tomato  mads-box gene is required for the development of a functional abscission zone in tomato flowers  <cit> . transcripts of the potato mads-box genes stmads <dig> and stmads <dig> are present in all vegetative tissues of potato, including roots and new tubers, but are not detected in floral organs  <cit> .

brmads squa-like genes expressed in the vegetative tissues might have some regulatory roles related to vegetative tissue development. potato mads-box  <dig>  a potato squa-like gene, exhibited widespread expression in actively growing tissues such as meristems, roots, new leaves and new tubers  <cit> .

stress responsive mads-box genes in b. rapa
mads-box genes have already been identified to play roles under low temperature stress in tomato  <cit> , while seven mads-box genes have been demonstrated to take part in stress  responses in rice  <cit> . our qpcr analysis revealed differential expression of thirteen mads-box genes  in response to cold stress . we observed, expression patterns some of these potential genes  were not consistent with the microarray results. however, we identified some candidate stress-resistance and stress-susceptibility genes based on up- and down-regulation of the genes between two inbred lines, chiifu and kenshin, of b. rapa. we found that chiifu, as a cold-resistant line, showed more up-regulation of mads-box genes than did kenshin in response to cold stress via qpcr analysis. the exceptions were brmads <dig> and  <dig>  which exhibited much higher up-regulation in kenshin than in chiifu and these two genes might be related to cold susceptibility in kenshin. the highly expressed mads-box genes in chiifu might be involved in cold resistance, while their inactivity or very low activity in kenshin might play a role in the cold susceptibility of that line. we also identified six  and eight  mads-box genes as differentially expressed in response to salt and drought, respectively . similar phenomena as in cold stress were also observed in case of resistance against salt and drought stresses between the two lines of b. rapa. finally, we found brmads <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to be co-responsive against all three stresses, suggesting that these genes might have multiple stress resistance related functions in b. rapa. among the stress-induced genes, eleven were from the important mikcc group, which is well known for regulatory roles in growth and development of different higher plants. flc is repressed by cold and others flc-like genes are also responsive to temperature in different ways  <cit> . we also identified three cold responsive b. rapa flc-like genes  from this clade. in rice, all seven stress-responsive genes were also from mikcc  <cit> . likewise, in wheat, a large number of genes involved in flower development are associated with abiotic stress responses  <cit> . moreover, we found two mα genes  to show stress responsiveness in b. rapa, which has not been reported in any plant yet. our findings here serve as an important resource guiding specific investigations on the stress resistance of b. rapa related to mads-box genes.

CONCLUSIONS
this is a comprehensive and systemic analysis of mads-box tfs in b. rapa wherein we demonstrated their expression patterns in different growth organs and examined their responses to various abiotic stresses as well. our data set presented here, which includes likely b and c function genes that display male organ-specific expression, should be an important resource for study of male sterility in b. rapa. furthermore, the stress-responsive genes described in this study might be exploited for molecular breeding of b. rapa. the results presented here also facilitate selection of appropriate candidate genes for further functional characterization.
