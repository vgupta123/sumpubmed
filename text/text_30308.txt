BACKGROUND
soybean  is the world’s most widely grown legume crop and produces high quality grain which contains 35–55 % easily digestible protein, 17–27 % oil, and about 30 % carbohydrates, among others components  <cit> . photosynthesis during the reproductive stages is positively correlated with crop yield, and improving the photosynthetic capacity of leaves has been suggested as a way to increase crop yields  <cit> . solar radiation is absorbed by the antenna pigments in chloroplasts and the excitation energy is directed to the reaction center pigments through resonance energy transfer to drive photochemical processes  <cit> . chlorophylls a and b  represent the majority of the antenna complex pigments and thus are of great importance for light absorption, oxygen evolution, and conversion of light energy to chemical energy. in fact, the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed by a leaf is closely related to its chlorophyll concentration , which generally is positively related with photosynthetic rate . although not at all developmental stages, positive correlations between leaf chlorophyll concentration and photosynthesis have been reported for soybean , including correlation coefficients as high as ~ <dig> – <dig>  during r <dig> and r <dig> developmental stages  <cit> .

leaf pigments are commonly quantified using extract-based methods  but can also be assessed with non-destructive techniques. quantification by extract-based methods often involves the collection of leaf disks, solvent-based pigment extraction, and analysis by spectrophotometry or liquid chromatography. alternatively, spectral reflectance based methods may be used to assess pigment composition and content of intact leaves and/or canopies  <cit> . in fact, investigations into the relationships between plant characteristics and spectral reflectance have produced numerous models and spectral indices to predict a range of plant phenotypes, including chlorophyll content . spectral reflectance measurements can be made in controlled environments as well as in field conditions, are quick, and can be repeated on the same sampling area to assess temporal dynamics. in addition, in contrast to extract-based methods, spectral reflectance characteristics of plant tissue can be assessed across a broad range of spatial scales from sub-leaf to plant and field levels. as such, spectral reflectance based methods have attracted much attention for high-throughput plant phenotyping . given their role in light absorption, leaf and/or canopy spectral reflectance based methods are particularly promising for the assessment of chlorophylls  <cit> .

even though previous reports  indicate a considerable amount of genetic variation for chlorophyll characteristics in the soybean germplasm, only limited information on the genetics of soybean chlorophyll characteristics is available to date. much of this information is based on mutants with chlorophyll-deficient phenotypes, several of which have been mapped . in addition, li et al.  <cit>  mapped a total of  <dig> quantitative trait loci  for chlorophyll content determined using a chlorophyll meter  at different developmental stages based on data collected from one location in 1 year and two locations in a second year. however, only one common qtl each was found in the same year across the two locations and across the 2 years in one location. more recently, hao et al.  <cit>  conducted genome-wide association analyses of chlorophyll and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters on a population of  <dig> soybean genotypes and identified  <dig> snps associated with chlorophyll content determined using a spad meter. interestingly, for this study, hao et al. determined the phenotypes when plants were at the full seed developmental stage , by which time leaf traits including photosynthesis and chlorophyll levels are generally considerably reduced  <cit> . since leaf chlorophyll concentrations can change substantially over the course of plant and leaf development and are influenced by environmental and management factors, genotype by environment interactions, as observed by hao et al.  <cit>  and suggested by the results of li et al.  <cit> , are expected.

the vast majority of plant physiological traits are quantitative in nature  <cit> . quantitative trait analysis can be used to unravel the interactions of complex traits for plant physiologists and breeders  <cit> . probably because gas exchange measurements are very laborious and phenotypes are greatly influenced by environments during growth and measurement, the number of qtl studies for photosynthetic traits are relatively limited . nonetheless, genetic determinants of photosynthesis have been estimated in several species including wheat   <cit> , maize   <cit>  and pea   <cit> . in both wheat and pea, photosynthetic activity is controlled by additive gene action  <cit> . in pea, the chlorophyll content is also governed by a preponderance of additive effects. for soybean, li et al.  <cit>  observed additive gene effects for chlorophyll content in f2: <dig> and f2: <dig> populations, and there is evidence that soybean breeding improved leaf-level photosynthetic rates in canadian and chinese cultivars  <cit> . in contrast, koester et al.  <cit>  did not find a consistent increase in maximum photosynthetic capacity for us cultivars released between  <dig> and 2007; however, light interception, radiation use efficiency, and harvest index did increase with year of cultivar release  <cit> . interestingly, chlorophyll content of sunlit, fully expanded leaves at r <dig> increased with year of release for these cultivars. hence, a better understanding of the genetic complexity of chlorophyll dynamics in soybean and application of molecular markers to identify qtls associated with photosynthesis and photosynthesis-related traits may allow for continued improvement in photosynthesis and yields.

to date, no genome-wide association mapping study of total chlorophyll content based on high-throughput-amenable canopy spectral reflectance measurements has been published. in addition, a direct comparison of genetic loci identified for extract-based and spectral reflectance based chlorophyll traits is absent in the literature. therefore, the objective of this research was to use genome-wide association mapping to identify genomic loci associated with i) extract-based measurements of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll content, as well as chlorophyll a/b ratio, and ii) two canopy spectral reflectance-based indices for total chlorophyll content in soybean.

methods
experimental design
no specific permission was required for the field study as it was conducted at the university of missouri bradford research center.

field experiments were conducted in  <dig> and  <dig> at the bradford research center  in columbia, mo usa . a total of  <dig> maturity group iv soybean genotypes were grown on a mexico silt loam soil  in a randomized complete block design with three replications. soybean were planted at a density of  <dig> seeds m- <dig> on  <dig> may  <dig> and  <dig> may  <dig> in four-row plots measuring  <dig>  m in length and  <dig>  m in width. the crop was managed according to standard agronomic practices as previously described  <cit> . the genotypes included in this study consisted of plant introductions that were selected from the usda germplasm collection according to criteria in dhanapal et al.  <cit> . genome-wide association analyses for chlorophyll traits were conducted on  <dig> of the  <dig> genotypes grown.

chlorophyll content determinations
chlorophyll contents were determined using extract- and canopy reflectance-based methods. the chlorophyll contents determined from extracts of leaf disks are hereafter referred to as chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , chlorophyll a/b ratio  and total chlorophyll . the two total chlorophyll contents derived from canopy spectral reflectance are hereafter referred to as i) spectral reflectance index total chlorophyll content , and ii) wavelet transformed spectral reflectance total chlorophyll content . a list of these traits along with their acronyms is provided in table  <dig>  briefly, at 54 days after planting  and  <dig> dap , five  <dig>  cm <dig> leaf disks were collected from the upper-most fully expanded, sun-exposed leaf  from five different plants at flowering . the leaf disks were immediately placed in opaque glass vials containing 5 ml of ethanol . samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 24 h, after which, the vials were vigorously agitated. a 200 μl aliquot of each sample was transferred to a  <dig> well-plate  and absorbance measured at  <dig>   <dig>  and 470 nm on a scanning monochromatic spectrophotometer . total chlorophyll , chlorophyll a , and chlorophyll b  were calculated according to lichtenthaler  <cit> , expressed on a leaf-area basis . the ratio of echl_a and echl_b was determined and is referred to as echl_r.table  <dig> list of traits used in this study along with their acronyms



to match extract-based chlorophyll content determinations with chlorophyll assessments based on canopy spectral reflectance characteristics, reflectance measurements were conducted between  <dig> and  <dig> dap in  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> dap in  <dig> as described by singh et al.  <cit> . in brief, for each plot, three random spectral reflectance measurements were collected using an asd fieldspec, fr spectroradiometer . the fiber optic cable was positioned about  <dig>  m above the plant canopy and three reflectance spectra  were collected and averaged for each plot.

chlorophyll contents were calculated based on reflectance spectra from i) the ratio of the area under the curve in the 840–870 nm region and the 720–730 nm region   <cit>  for ichl_t, and ii) a model developed by singh et al.  <cit>  for tchl_t. singh et al.  <cit>  used the extract-based total chlorophyll content  data to test multiple models for total chlorophyll estimation based on canopy spectral reflectance measurements  <cit> . among the tested models  <cit> , one based on multiple linear regression  analysis and incorporating six wavebands derived from continuous wavelet transformed spectral reflectance data using the ‘mexican hat’ wavelet family, most accurately predicted echl_t. consequently, this model was used to estimate tchl_t.

descriptive statistics and blup calculation
all descriptive statistics and pearson correlation analyses were conducted for each variable  using proc mean and proc corr procedures of sas version  <dig>  . variance components were determined using the proc mixed of sas  <cit>  as described in dhanapal et al.  <cit> , considering all effects as random. broad sense heritability estimates for all variables were derived using variance components obtained from the proc mixed procedure of sas version  <dig>  as previously reported  <cit> . best linear unbiased prediction  values were used to reduce error variance. for each variable, data from both years were used to calculate one blup value to represent each genotype for gwas analysis.

kinship matrix and population structure
the genome-wide association mapping software tassel  <dig> . <dig> was used to create a kinship matrix . all  <dig>  polymorphic snps were used for generation of k based on the scaled identity by state  similarity method as described  <cit> . the software program structure  <dig>   <cit>  was used to infer the population structure based on ten independent iterations with  <dig> to  <dig> hypothetical sub-populations with an admixture and allele frequency correlated model. the correct estimation of k  was provided by joining the log probability of data  from the structure output and an ad hoc statistic Δk, determined by the value at which lnp reached a plateau as described in  <cit> .

snp genotyping and genome wide association mapping
genotypic data from the soysnp50k iselect snp beadchip  <cit>  are publicly available at soybase  and were obtained for the  <dig> soybean accessions and used in this study. for genome-wide association mapping of echl_a, echl_b, echl_r, echl_t, tchl_t and ichl_t,  <dig>  polymorphic snps with a minor allele frequency  ≥ 5 % across the  <dig> genotypes were used.

genome-wide association mapping was conducted based on the blup values using a mixed linear model with q-matrix and k-matrix . the q and k matrices were used as corrections for population structure and/or genetic relatedness to help avoid false positives  <cit> .

genome-wide association mapping based on the mlm + q + k model was conducted with tassel  <dig>  <cit> . multiple testing was performed using qvalue r  <dig> . <dig>  employing the smoother method  <cit> , an extension of the false discovery rate  method  <cit> , to assess the significance of marker-trait associations. all markers that satisfied multiple testing had –log <dig> p values ≥  <dig> , which is above the threshold used by others for soybean . markers with fdr <  <dig>  were considered significant  <cit> .

RESULTS
environmental conditions, chlorophyll phenotypes, and broad-sense heritability
in general, environmental conditions for the period from planting through collection of leaf disks and canopy spectral reflectance measurements were similar between the 2 years and close to 30-year averages. daily average temperatures between planting and leaf-disk sampling were somewhat higher in  <dig>  than in  <dig> . the observed differences in temperatures were mirrored by higher solar radiation in  <dig>  than in  <dig> . precipitation totals for the months encompassing planting through collection of leaf disks and canopy spectral reflectance measurements  were the same or greater in  <dig> and  <dig> than the 30 year averages. cumulative precipitation for may, june, and july was  <dig>   <dig>  and 319 mm for  <dig>   <dig>  and the 30-year average, respectively, and irrigation was therefore not necessary to avoid drought stress in either year.

the  <dig> mg iv soybean genotypes varied widely for the different chlorophyll traits . analysis of variance indicated significant year effects for all six traits . however, except for the chlorophyll a/b ratio , no genotype by year interactions were observed. for all traits, mean and median values were larger in  <dig> than  <dig>  the ranges in chlorophyll contents in  <dig> were smaller than in  <dig> for all traits except tchl_t. across the 2 years, the range in chlorophyll content was largest for echl_t  followed by echl_a , tchl_t , echl_b , and a considerably smaller range for ichl_t . the echl_r, the only trait for which a genotype by year interaction was observed, ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   across the 2 years. correlation coefficients for each trait between the 2 years ranged from  <dig>  for echl_a to  <dig>  for tchl_t and were highly significant , except for echl_r which was  <dig>  but nonetheless significant .fig.  <dig> box plot showing differences in chlorophyll a , total chlorophyll  and chlorophyll b  using the extract-based chlorophyll method and total chlorophyll using extractable chlorophyll method , wavelet transformed spectral reflectance chlorophyll method  and spectral reflectance index total chlorophyll method . box edges represent the upper and lower quantile with median value shown as bold line in the middle of the box and mean values as white diamonds. left scale represent the values for echl_a, echl_t and tchl_t. right scale represents the values for echl_r, echl_b and ichl_t



the relationships among all chlorophyll traits, including extract-based and canopy spectral reflectance based determinations, were examined by correlation analysis based on across-year genotypic averages. as expected, strong positive correlations were observed between echl_a and echl_b , echl_a and echl_t , echl_b and echl_t . the two canopy-based reflectance methods for total chlorophyll content were positively correlated with extract-based total chlorophyll content  and also showed significant positive correlations with extract-based chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b measurements . however, as illustrated by the big difference in ichl_t compared to echl_t based chlorophyll contents, the index applied to the canopy spectral reflectance measurements to calculate ichl_t, did not predict well the absolute values of echl_t. calculations of broad-sense heritability indicated the highest heritability for tchl_t  followed by ichl_t , echl_b , echl_t , echl_a  and echl_r .table  <dig> pearson correlation coefficients for extractable chlorophyll traits chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , total chlorophyll  and chlorophyll a/b ratio  and wavelet transformed spectral reflectance total chlorophyll  and spectral reflectance index total chlorophyll

genome-wide association mapping
with the exception of echl_r no significant genotype by year interactions were observed. therefore, blup values across years were calculated for each chlorophyll trait and used for genome-wide association mapping. analysis was conducted with  <dig>  snp markers and the extractable chlorophyll traits including echl_a, echl_b and echl_r and echl_t and two canopy-based reflectance methods for total chlorophyll  was conducted using an mlm + q + k model using tassel  <dig> . <dig> software. the k  and q  were used as corrections for genetic relatedness and population structure to help avoid false positives  <cit> . application of qfdr <  <dig>  reduced the number of snps from  <dig>  to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unique candidate snps associated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative genomic loci for echl_a, echl_b, echl_t and echl_r, respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig> unique candidate snps showed association with  <dig> and  <dig> putative loci for tchl_t and ichl_t, respectively .

association analysis for echl_a identified a total of  <dig> significant snps. since snps in close proximity probably identify the same locus, these  <dig> unique snps likely mark  <dig> putative loci . the r <dig> for these loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . the putative echl_a locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by seven closely spaced snps and the one on chromosome  <dig> by three snps. one of two loci on chromosome  <dig> was identified by two snps while the remaining eleven loci were marked by one snp each.fig.  <dig> location of putative loci significantly associated with extractable chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , total chlorophyll  and chlorophyll a/b ratio  and  <dig> chlorophyll-related genes identified in soybase, literature search and kegg pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis. loci are indicated by upward triangles, squares, downward triangles and circles positioned above the respective chromosome. for each chromosome, the black dots represent the locations of snps evaluated for association with echl_a, echl_b, echl_r and echl_t



fifteen unique snps were identified as having significant associations with echl_b. based on their genomic position, these  <dig> snps likely identified seven putative loci with r <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %  . the putative echl_b locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by five closely spaced snps, one locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by four snps, and the remaining six loci were identified by a single snp significantly associated with echl_b.

for echl_r, association analysis indicated  <dig> significant snps. together these  <dig> snps likely identified  <dig> putative loci with r <dig> ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . six of these loci were identified by a single snp each . putative loci located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and one of the two loci on chromosome  <dig>  were identified by two closely spaced snps.

a total of  <dig> unique snps were significantly associated with echl_t phenotypic blup values, identifying a total of  <dig> putative loci . the r <dig> for these putative loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % . one putative locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by seven closely spaced snps and, one on chromosome  <dig> was identified by four closely spaced snps, while one of two loci each on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> were identified by two closely spaced snps. the remaining eleven loci were identified by one snp each, showing significant association for echl_t.fig.  <dig> location of putative loci significantly associated with total chlorophyll  and  <dig> chlorophyll related genes identified in soybase, literature search and kegg pathway of chlorophyll biosynthesis. loci are indicated by hexagrams, large diamonds and downward triangles positioned above the respective chromosomes. for each chromosome, the black dots represent the locations of snps evaluated for association with total chlorophyll 



genome-wide association analysis for the two canopy spectral reflectance based methods used for total chlorophyll determination resulted in the identification of  <dig>  and  <dig>  candidate snps, representing  <dig> and  <dig> putative loci, respectively . the r <dig> for the putative loci ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for tchl_t and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % for ichl_t . the  <dig> snps significantly associated with tchl_t marked  <dig> putative loci of which one, located on chromosome  <dig>  was identified by five closely spaced snps, and one locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by three closely spaced snps. one locus each on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> were identified by two snps, and the remaining eight loci were identified by one snp each showing significant association for tchl_t. the  <dig> unique snps significantly associated with ichl_t marked  <dig> putative loci of which seven were identified by single snps  . one locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by four closely spaced snps, one locus on chromosome  <dig> by three closely spaced snps, and one locus each on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> by two closely spaced snps.

genome-wide association mapping for extract-based chlorophyll traits identified a total of  <dig> snps  with  <dig> unique putative candidate snps contributing to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative loci for echl_a and echl_b, echl_r and echl_t, respectively . the  <dig> snps marked  <dig> unique putative loci, seven of which were identified by three of the four extract-based chlorophyll traits. eight of the  <dig> loci were identified by at least two of the four chlorophyll traits and the remaining nine loci were only identified by one of the four chlorophyll traits. none of the snps or loci identified for echl_r overlapped with those found for echl_a, echl_b, or echl_t. examination of snps identified for echl_a, echl_b and echl_t identified several that were detected based on two or three of these traits . twenty-two snps were in common between echl_a and echl_t,  <dig> snps between echl_b and echl_t,  <dig> snps between echl_a and echl_b, and nine snps were common among all three traits  . one locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by five closely spaced snps and one locus each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> was identified by one snp, showing significant association with echl_a, echl_b and echl_t.fig.  <dig>

mapping of total chlorophyll content based on echl_t, tchl_t, and ichl_t indicated a total of  <dig> significant snps . of these  <dig> snps, five snps were identified based on all three methods, one snp was in common between echl_t and ichl_t only, and one snp was in common between tchl_t and ichl_t only . of the five total snps identified based on all three methods, one locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified by two closely spaced snps, and three loci, one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were identified by one snp each that was in common for echl_t, tchl_t and ichl_t  . consequently, a total of  <dig> unique snps representing  <dig> putative loci were found. four of the  <dig> putative loci were identified using all three total chlorophyll determination methods . one putative locus each on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> was identified for tchl_t and ichl_t but not echl_t. another locus on chromosome  <dig> was identified for echl_t and ichl_t but not tchl_t. the remaining  <dig> putative loci were all identified for only one of the three methods of total chlorophyll determination .

identification of candidate snps and genes
all snps identified for echl_a , echl_b , echl_r , echl_t , tchl_t , and ichl_t  that satisfied the fdr <  <dig>  were considered as the most promising candidate snps associated with chlorophyll contents or the chl a/b ratio. based on the 60 bp sequences flanking the  <dig> unique candidate snps for extract-based chlorophyll traits and  <dig> unique candidate snps for the three total chlorophyll content traits, a blast search was conducted with default parameters in soybase  to identify putative candidate genes. the search for candidate genes found that, for extract-based chlorophyll traits,  <dig> snps were present in introns or coding regions of a gene, and that, for the three total chlorophyll content traits,  <dig> snps were present in introns, coding regions or 3’- untranslated regions  of a gene . for all snps not located in a gene, the gene closest to the snp was identified in soybase and is listed in the supporting documents . however, none of these genes have any obvious direct relationship with any of the chlorophyll traits. an additional search for candidate genes was performed in soybase using the term “chlorophyll”, and soybean chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway . these searches revealed  <dig> chlorophyll-related genes from soybase and  <dig> chlorophyll-related genes from the kegg pathway . of these chlorophyll-related genes,  <dig> were located within ± 3 mb  <cit>  of one of the  <dig> unique candidate snps identified for extract-based chlorophyll traits , and  <dig> chlorophyll-related genes that were located within ± 3 mb of one of the  <dig> unique candidate snps identified for the three total chlorophyll content traits .table  <dig> list of  <dig> known chlorophyll-related genes within a ± 3 mb region of the  <dig> putative candidate snps identified from soybase  for extractable chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , total chlorophyll  and chlorophyll a/b ratio

discussion
chlorophyll phenotypes
considerable variation in extract-based chlorophyll traits  and canopy-based spectral reflectance total chlorophyll content traits  was observed among the  <dig> soybean genotypes . the echl_a, echl_b, echl_t, and echl_r average values observed were similar to chlorophyll contents and chlorophyll a/b ratios reported previously for soybean  <cit> . as expected, given that total chlorophyll is a function of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, the correlations of echl_a and echl_b with echl_t were positive and very strong . positive relationships were also found among all three total chlorophyll traits, despite the fact that leaf disks extracted for echl_t determination were collected from uppermost fully expanded, sun-exposed leaflets while the reflectance measurements used for tchl_t and ichl_t determination represented a canopy of leaves of different ages and positions on the plants. both tchl_t and ichl_t were estimated based on the same canopy spectral reflectance measurements, but the two determinations were based on independent indices, one developed by gitelson et al.  <cit> , and the other by singh et al.  <cit> . nonetheless, the two canopy spectral reflectance based estimates were more closely related to each other than either of them was with echl_t. since tchl_t was estimated based on a model singh et al.  <cit>  developed using the echl_t and canopy spectral reflectance measurements from the  <dig> genotypes examined in this study, the stronger positive correlation between echl_t and tchl_t compared to echl_t and ichl_t was expected .

putative loci for extract-based chlorophyll traits and known chlorophyll genes in their vicinity
advances in high-throughput genotyping technologies have enabled genome-wide association analysis to be a powerful tool for detection and mapping of quantitative trait loci  underlying complex traits in soybean. the mlm + q + k model applied in this study resulted in the identification of between  <dig> and  <dig> significant snps for each of the investigated chlorophyll traits. the majority of the snps identified for echl_a, echl_b, and echl_t, were common between at least two of these traits, and nine of them were common between all three traits. in fact, all snps that were identified for echl_a were also identified for either echl_b or echl_t, or for all three traits . specifically, 55 % of significant snps were in common between echl_a and echl_b, 56 % between echl_b and echl_t, and 45 % between echl_a and echl_t. since chl a and chl b are synthesized by the same pathway, can be interconverted by a chl a—chl b cycle, and sum to make up the total chlorophyll content  <cit> , this was anticipated and, to some extent, cross-validates the genome-wide association analysis results for the echl_a, echl_b, and echl_t traits. in total, five loci were identified to be common among these three traits, one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  of the five loci, the loci on chromosome  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were located in the vicinity of known chlorophyll related genes . surprisingly, no known chlorophyll-related genes were located near the loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  thus, these loci may identify genes that have not yet been implicated in the modulation of chlorophyll content. while the loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were also identified based on tchl_t and ichl_t, the loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were not, and therefore may be of particular relevance to chlorophyll content in fully expanded sun-exposed leaves near the top of the canopy and not, or less so, for leaves that are older and/or at different position in the canopy . the known chlorophyll related genes found near the loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that were identified based on echl_a, echl_b, echl_t, tchl_t, and ichl_t, include genes annotated to encode proteins that have magnesium chelatase activity . magnesium chelatase catalyzes the insertion of mg2+ into protoporphryin ix, which is the first committed step in chlorophyll biosynthesis   <cit> .

the remaining  <dig> loci that were identified based on extract-based chlorophyll traits were marked by  <dig> snps, and a search for chlorophyll related genes identified  <dig> genes in their vicinity . given how closely related the chlorophyll traits are, more confidence and greater importance can be given to loci that were identified based on more than one trait. these included two loci identified based on three chlorophyll traits  and echl_a, echl_t and echl_r ), and  <dig> loci that were identified based on two chlorophyll traits. the remaining  <dig> loci were based on single extract-based chlorophyll traits  .

among the chlorophyll-related genes found in the vicinity of the putative loci, chlorophyll a-b binding proteins  were the most prominent, followed by genes encoding proteins with magnesium chelatase activity  . however, the search for chlorophyll-related genes did not reveal hits near every putative locus. this includes the aforementioned loci on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  that were identified by chl_a, echl_b, and echl_t as well as five additional loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> that were marked by one or a combination of other echl-based traits. interestingly, the echl_r-based locus on chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  were located close to two and one leaflet chlorophyll content qtl, respectively, that were previously identified  <cit>  based on a biparental mapping population. one chlorophyll-related gene, recently cloned  <cit>  as “stay-green  gene d2”, controls the stay-green phenotype in soybean and is involved in regulation of chlorophyll degradation. recently, campbell et al.  <cit>  cloned a magnesium chelatase subunit located on chromosome  <dig>  near the first of two loci associated with echl_r, and reed et al.  <cit>  identified gene involved in the biogenesis of photosystem i and ii near the second echl_r locus on chromosome  <dig>  which was also close to a chlorophyll content qtl previously identified by hao et al.  <cit> . both of these genes were identified in distinct chlorophyll deficient mutants. another echl_r-based-locus on chromosome  <dig> was found near a qtl identified by hao et al.  <cit>  and the qtls for mutant’s y <dig> and y <dig> identified by palmer and xu  <cit>  that condition green/chlorotic foliage. the echl_a and echl_t-based locus on chromosome  <dig> was also located close to one leaflet chlorophyll content qtl previously identified by li et al.  <cit> . in addition, one of the echl_a and echl_t-based loci on chromosome  <dig> as well as the echl_t-based locus on chromosome  <dig> were located close to chlorophyll content qtl previously identified  <cit>  using snp markers.

putative loci for echl_t, tchl_t, and ichl_t and known chlorophyll genes in their vicinity
total chlorophyll content was mapped based on leaf-level  and canopy-level estimates . in total,  <dig> snps,  <dig> of which were unique, were identified for total chlorophyll content based on these three phenotypes. these snps identify  <dig> putative loci in  <dig> chromosomal regions . among significant snps, 22 % were in common between echl_t and tchl_t, 33 % between tchl_t, and ichl_t, and 30 % between echl_t, and ichl_t. the r <dig> values for total chlorophyll loci identified in this study were higher  than the r <dig> values  reported by hao et al.   <cit> . a search for chlorophyll-related genes resulted in  <dig> candidate genes in the vicinity  of these  <dig> unique candidate snps . the chromosomal locations of the  <dig> snps and  <dig> candidate genes are shown in fig.  <dig>  as for extract based chlorophyll traits, the most common chlorophyll related genes found in the vicinity of the putative loci were genes encoding chlorophyll a-b binding proteins  and genes encoding proteins with magnesium chelatase activity  .

four putative loci, one each on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were common for all three total chlorophyll phenotypes, thus imparting particular confidence in the validity of these loci . as mentioned above, the loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were also detected based on echl_a and echl_b phenotypes. in contrast to the loci on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  no known chlorophyll related gene was identified in the vicinity of the locus on chromosome  <dig>  despite having been identified by echl_a, echl_b, echl_t, tchl_t and ichl_t phenotypes .

of the remaining  <dig> loci for total chlorophyll content, only three were identified by associations using two methods of chlorophyll determination. one of these, on chromosome  <dig>  was found identified using echl_t and ichl_t as well as echl_a, and was located in the immediate vicinity of a gene annotated as magnesium chelatase . the other two loci were located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and were both identified with the two canopy spectral reflectance-based traits. while no known chlorophyll-related gene was found near the locus on chromosome  <dig>  two genes  were found near the locus on chromosome  <dig>  of the remaining  <dig> loci identified by single canopy reflectance-based traits,  <dig> had at least one chlorophyll related gene nearby . also, the locus identified based on ichl_t on chromosome  <dig> was near a qtl for a viable yellow mutant identified by espinosa  <cit>  and near a chlorophyll content qtl identified by hao et al  <cit> . a qtl for a yellow leaf  mutant identified  <cit> , was located near the second tchl_t locus identified on chromosome  <dig>  interestingly, one qtl identified by li et al.  <cit>  and one identified by hao et al.  <cit> , were also located near that same putative locus on chromosome  <dig> that was also located in the vicinity of a magnesium chelatase . two loci for ichl_t on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> respectively were found near chlorophyll content qtls previously identified by hao et al.  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
significant variation in chlorophyll content  was observed among the  <dig> mg iv soybean genotypes examined in this study. genome-wide association analysis identified putative loci associated with each of six chlorophyll traits examined. twenty-four unique putative loci on  <dig> chromosomes were identified for extract-based chlorophyll traits. for total chlorophyll content, determined using three methods, association analyses identified  <dig> putative loci on  <dig> chromosomes. several of the loci were identified by more than one chlorophyll trait and since the traits are closely related, more confidence and greater importance can be given to loci that were identified by more than one trait. while many of the putative loci identified were located near genes previously identified or annotated as related to chlorophyll traits, numerous snps marked chromosomal regions where no known chlorophyll-related genes were found. putative chlorophyll-related loci identified based on high-throughput amenable canopy spectral reflectance characteristics indicate that canopy spectral reflectance can provide useful phenotypes for genome-wide association mapping.
