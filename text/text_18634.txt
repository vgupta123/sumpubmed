BACKGROUND
white pine blister rust  caused by cronartium ribicola  is a devastating fungal disease of five-needle pines  around world. since the early 20th century, when it was accidently introduced into north america, wpbr has spread over the continent where native five-needle pine species were distributed, with severe ecological and economic damages. wpbr has decreased western white pine  populations up to 90 %, and also seriously disturbed forest ecosystems of other native five-needle pines. breeding programs for selection of genetic resistance to wpbr have been undertaken in sugar pine , wwp , eastern white pine , whitebark pine , limber pine  and others with significant progress  <cit> . both major gene resistance  and quantitative disease resistance have been discovered and utilized in the five-needle pine breeding and conservation programs. mgr has been reported in four five-needle pine species: p. lambertiana, p. monticola, p. strobiformis, and p. flexilis  <cit> ; and it is characterized by hypersensitive response -like reactions in the pine needles infected by c. ribicola  <cit> . this reaction is characterized by a rapid induction of host cell death and subsequent localized tissue necrosis, which prevents spread of the rust mycelium to vascular stem tissue. however, cri virulent races  have arisen and the corresponding breakdown of mgr have been documented in regions where resistant p. lambertiana and p. monticola are planted  <cit> . therefore, wpbr is still the major constraint to re-plantation of five-needle pines for the forest industry and restoration of ecosystems in western north america.

c. ribicola is an obligate biotrophic fungus and requires an alternate host plant  for completion of its life cycle   <cit> . in spring  aeciospores are released from stem cankers of susceptible five-needle pines and dispersed by air onto ribes plants. aeciospores germinate on ribes leaves to initiate the asexual stage of infection, which involves mycelium growth in ribes leaf tissue, sporulation to produce urediniospores, and repeated infection of nearby ribes by urediniospores throughout the summer season. in late summer or early fall, telia begin to grow and produce rows of teliospores. as the weather becomes wet and cooler, teliospores germinate in place and produce basidia, where basidiospores are developed, dispersed via air movement and subsequently to infect pine host. the germinated basidiospore enters pine needles through stomata, and hyphae then grow along vascular tissues into the branch and stem. the mycelium continues to spread in the bark tissues of susceptible five-needle pines, resulting in a swollen canker in the next spring or summer.fig.  <dig>

during the initial infection stage by basidiospores, a typical haustorium-pine cell interface was observed in the wpbr pathosystem  <cit> . haustorially expressed secreted proteins , including effectors, are proposed to play key roles in manipulating the immune responses of host cells  <cit> . effectors are microbial and pest secreted molecules that alter host-cell processes or structures to generally promote their own lifestyle. effector functions are as diverse as suppressing immune responses to enhancing access to nutrients  <cit> . there are at least four avirulence  effectors  and two virulence effectors  in c. ribicola  <cit> . however, the molecular identities of these cri effectors are unknown, and as is how they reprogram biological processes to facilitate rust pathogen growth and to mitigate host defenses in five-needle pines. virulence effectors overcome plant immunity by modifying host metabolism to support pathogen growth and spread, which is termed as effector-triggered susceptibility . avr effectors are recognized by specific host receptors encoded by plant resistance  genes to activate a host defense response termed as effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . some avr effectors translocate into plant cells where their activity is recognized for re-programming plant transcription, metabolism, and defense during pathogen infection  <cit> . the virulence effectors play a crucial role in virulent fungal races overcoming plant mgr by escaping eti.

next generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have rapidly advanced in recent years. genome sequences of four rust fungal species have been reported: melampsora larici-populina , m. lini , puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici , and p. striiformis f.sp. tritici  . based on bioinformatic analyses and gene expression studies of the infected host tissues or haustoria,  <dig> to12% of the predicted proteomes of these rust fungi corresponds to secreted proteins as candidate effectors. rna-seq has become an instrumental assay for the analysis of multiple aspects of fungal transcriptomes, such as transcriptional profiling , identification of putative virulence genes  <cit> , secretome analysis  <cit> , gene models and alternative transcript splicing  <cit> , and structural gene annotations  <cit> . these genomic studies provide valuable research resources and tools in understanding the dynamics of plant-rust pathogen interactions.

to provide genomic insight into in planta transcriptome profiles of the wpbr pathosystem, we performed de novo sequencing of the cri transcriptome using rna-seq analysis during infection of wwp and the alternate host, ribes. we assessed cri transcriptomes and predicted  <dig> secreted proteins. global gene expression profiling allowed us to characterize transcript expression of genes that have putative key roles during biotrophic infection and mycelial growth inside host tissues. in particular, identification of candidate effectors provides novel insights into molecular wp-br interactions, which until now have been poorly understood. this first large-scale genomics resource of the wpbr pathosystem provides the relevant sequences and gene regulation information for gene discovery, functional and population genomics, comparative analyses, and future efforts to annotate its genome. this resource permits the study of this rust fungus at the genome level as well as providing data for researchers working with other cronartium species.

RESULTS
de novo assembly of cri transcriptomes
fungal samples at cri life cycle stages of aeciospore, urediniospore, and mycelium growth in infected wwp needles and cankered stems were used for rna-seq analysis . we used aeciospore- and urediniospore-derived rna-seq reads  in de novo assembly for construction of a cri reference transcriptome , which resulted in  <dig>  transcripts expressed from  <dig>  unigenes for further analysis. this cri reference transcriptome had a total length of  <dig> mb, n <dig> of  <dig> -bp, and average length of  <dig> -bp . transdecoder predicted the cri reference proteome with a total of  <dig>  putative proteins with minimum length of  <dig> amino acids,  <dig>   open reading frames  were complete sequences . the cri reference transcriptome  has been deposited at genbank as a transcriptome shotgun assembly  under accession gbsg <dig> 

rna-seq reads from infected pine stem tissues were used for de novo assembly of dual transcriptomes of c. ribicola and p. monticola. by alignment analysis of dual transcriptomes with the cri reference transcriptome generated here and p. monticola stem reference transcriptome  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  sequences were separated as the cri associated transcripts that were in planta expressed in the infected stems .

annotation of the cri reference transcriptome
compared with cri cdna sequences  available from genbank, de novo assembled transcripts showed 100 % identity to them. over 94 % of the core eukaryotic gene  set, which contains  <dig>  ceg variants from six eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , matched peptides of the cri reference proteome, with an average of 89 % of the protein length aligned . blastp analysis of the cri reference proteome against mlp-, mli-, pst-, and pgt-proteomes revealed that 51–59 % of cri proteins were conserved between cri and other rust fungi . blastp with reciprocal best hits  identified  <dig>  orthologs  between cri and mlp. similarly, orthomcl analysis assigned putative cri proteins into  <dig>  ortholog groups. the number of rust fungal orthologs from c. ribicola is very close to the reports on other rust pathogens  <cit> , indicating that the core genes are well covered in the cri reference transcriptome.

gene annotation revealed that about 60 % of total transcripts  showed homology hits  in a search against the ncbi nr database, and 43 % of them  were assigned at least one gene ontology  term. a blastx top-hit species distribution of gene annotations showed highest homology to mlp , followed by pgt , baudoinia compniacensis , and dothistroma septosporum  . this result suggests that cri may be closest to mlp at the transcriptome level based on the databases reported so far.

after assigning cri transcripts to the categories of cellular processes, molecular functions, and cellular components , go enzyme code mapping further identified  <dig> unique enzyme codes for  <dig>  cri proteins, which were involved in  <dig> metabolic pathways. the dbcan v <dig>  hmm-based cazy annotation  <cit>  identified  <dig> cri cazy-like proteins with assignment to  <dig> cazy families. of all annotated cazymes,  <dig>  % were grouped into  <dig> families of glycosyl hydrolases ,  <dig>  % to  <dig> families of glycosyl transferases ,  <dig>  % to seven families of carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig>  % to four polysaccharide lyase  families,  <dig>  % to  <dig> families of carbohydrate binding modules , and  <dig>  % to seven families of redox enzymes that act in conjunction with cazymes  . the top gh families are gh <dig> , gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and gh <dig> , containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins respectively, consistent with recent findings in pst, pgt, and mlp  <cit> . the three most abundant ce families were ce <dig> , ce <dig> , and ce <dig> . among the gt group, gt <dig> , gt <dig> , and gt <dig>  were extensively expanded with more expressed genes than others . a blastp search against the transporter classification database  <cit>  identified  <dig>  cri proteins  related to transporter activity and they were assigned to  <dig> transporter families . the most abundant transporter family was the major facilitator superfamily , functioning for the uptake of sugars, oligosaccharides, amino acids, metabolites, and others.

identification of secreted proteins and candidate effectors
because secreted proteins have potential roles in plant-microbe interactions, we analyzed the cri secretome based on transcript assemblies . secreted proteins were encoded by  <dig> transcripts in the cri reference transcriptome that originated from rust fungal spores and  <dig>  transcripts in the cri-associated transcripts that originated from cankered wwp stems. following cap <dig> alignment of the complete orfs of these secreted protein-encoding transcripts, a total of  <dig> unique proteins were identified as secreted proteins. a blastp search against a dataset of candidate effectors with  <dig>  proteins from the other four rust pathogens  <cit>  showed that  <dig>  cri secreted proteins were cronartium-specific, as they showed no significant homology to candidate effectors reported on other rust fungi  . because a large number of pathogenic effectors share features as secreted, small and cysteine-rich proteins  that lack homology to proteins in other species, we examined the cri secretome and manual curation found that it contained  <dig> proteins with lengths shorter than  <dig> amino acids and  <dig> of them had at least four cysteine residues in the mature proteins. as anticipated, most of these cri ssps  had no functional annotation as shown by blast2go analysis.fig.  <dig> workflow of secretome prediction using bioinformatics tools for the comprehensive characterization of proteins secreted at spore development stages or during the in-planta mycelium growth stage in infected stems of western white pine



of annotated cri secreted proteins,  <dig> belonged to  <dig> families of cazymes , and 36 % of the cri secretome contained distinct pfam-a domains . pfam domains abundant in secreted proteins included peptidases or proteases , cfem , cu-oxidases, dpbb- <dig> , and gpi-anchored domains. numerous fungal proteins with these domains have been reported with functional involvement in fungal pathogenicity. other pfam domains related to fungal pathogenicity, such as cap , hsp , dnaj/dnaj-x , and thaumatin, were also identified in multiple cri secreted proteins .

to recover additional secreted proteins among partial orf sequences, the cri reference proteome was used as a query in a blastp search against the cri secreted protein dataset. to generate a more complete dataset of candidate effectors, cri candidate effectors were found using a blastp search of the cri reference proteome against candidate effectors from other rust fungis  <cit> , then further filtered by a blastp search against the phi database  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  proteins  were identified as cri candidate effectors, of which  <dig>  %  contained a total of  <dig> distinct pfam domains by pfam annotation. among these annotated domains,  <dig> domains were selected because the  <dig> cri candidate effectors with these pfam domains also showed significant homologies to the phi proteins documented with phenotypic effects on virulence and pathogenicity, such as hypervirulence, loss of pathogenicity, reduced virulence, etc. . the largest clusters of protein families within the  <dig> candidate effectors were protein kinases , small gtpases , cazymes , dead/deah box helicases, wd <dig> proteins, hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> proteins, and proteins with aaa domains and rna recognition motifs .

analysis of transcriptome profiles
to investigate in planta rust fungal gene expression, trimmed rna-seq reads were mapped to the cri reference transcriptome. 86 % of the reads from aeciospores and 85 % of the reads from urediniospores were aligned to the transcripts while about  <dig> % and 6 % of the reads from infected stem and infected needle tissues respectively were derived from the cri reference transcriptome . of the cri reference transcriptome,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   transcripts were detected at life cycle stages of aeciospore, urediniospore, and infected stem, respectively. in total, we detected  <dig>  transcripts that were commonly expressed in all three types of samples. in contrast, only  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> contigs were detected with exclusive expression in aeciospore, urediniospore, and infected stem respectively . to further analyze the detailed infection regulatory program, rna-seq analysis was performed for four pair-wise comparisons of transcriptome profiles: aeciospore vs. urediniospore, aeciospore vs. infected stem, urediniospore vs. infected stem, and susceptible needles vs. resistant needles infected by basidiospores at 4 days post infection . the full set of expression data  for the cri reference transcriptome is shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  pearson correlation analysis showed good sample reproducibility for aeciospores , urediniospores , and infected stems , respectively. transcripts with normalized fold change > ± <dig>  in at least one paired comparison were considered differentially expressed genes  with up- or down-regulation and their numbers are shown for each comparison in fig.  <dig>  as compared to both aeciospore and urediniospore, in planta mycelium growth inside infected stem tissues consistently triggered a higher number of up-regulated transcripts than down-regulated transcripts .table  <dig> mapping of rna-seq reads using cronartium ribicola reference transcriptome

based on normalized expression values calculated by rna-seq analysis, hierarchical clustering of expression patterns by heatmap analysis revealed that in planta genome-wide transcriptional profiles were more similar to each other than to the profiles at the aeciospore and urediniospore stages; likewise, the latter two showed greater similar to each other. similar patterns were observed among three categories of genes encoding secreted proteins, candidate effectors, and cazymes . these results demonstrate that the cri transcriptome is extensively reprogrammed during pine stem infection.fig.  <dig> heatmaps of transcript expression based on normalized data of expression values  in three functional categories. only differentially expressed genes  with minimum fold change of two with p < <dig>  after adjustment using false discovery rate  are shown in the heatmaps. overrepresented  and underrepresented transcripts  are shown as relative to the expression values measured across four stages of the rust life cycle, infected pine needle  at  <dig> dpi, infected pine stems , aeciospore , and urediniospore  in infected ribes leaves. a secreted proteins; b candidate effectors with functional annotation in the phi database; c cazymes



due to their functional relevance to virulence and pathogenicity, secreted proteins, candidate effectors, and cazymes were examined in detail for regulation of their transcript expression by heatmap analysis. of  <dig> secreted protein genes,  <dig>  % of them were identified as degs and the heatmap showed six transcript expression patterns: i, iii, and vi with up-regulation at rust spore developmental stages, and ii, iv, and v with in-planta up regulation . genes encoding secreted proteins in pattern v exhibited up-regulation in both infected pine needles and cankered stem. degs accounted for  <dig>  % of  <dig> annotated cri candidate effectors that encompassed all six transcript expression patterns, among them patterns ii, iii-b, iv, and v show transcripts with in-planta up-regulation .  <dig>  % of cri cazymes were identified as degs and they were clustered into four expression patterns by heatmap analysis . although many cazymes were highly expressed in urediniospores, cazyme genes in subclusters i-a, ii-b, ii-d, and ii-f were significantly up-regulated only in the cankered stems .

the proteins belonging to fungal gene families with multiple members were generally distributed in different clusters or subclusters on the expression heatmaps. some members were expressed at similar levels in the fungal cells from both infected pine stems and ribes leaves while other members were expressed in contrasting patterns between these two infected hosts . as exceptions to this general observation, members of seven cazy families  and proteins with cfem, ferritin_ <dig>  zf-c2h <dig>  and rvt- <dig> domains were highly expressed in infected ribes leaves. in contrast, gene families for dnaj-x/hsp <dig>  fkbp, peptidase-s <dig>  superoxide dismutases , β- <dig> -glucanosyltransglycosylases , atp synthases , the cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen  <dig>  and pathogenesis-related  <dig> proteins , citrate synthases , pectate lyases , and polysaccharide lyases  were highly expressed in infected pine stems .

to validate whether the rna-seq analysis reflected their gene expression,  <dig> genes were selected as representatives of secreted proteins, cazymes, and phi proteins and they were used to perform qrt-pcr analysis . relative expression values were highly variable among biological repeats, but this qrt-pcr analysis confirmed the general expression patterns as revealed by rna-seq analysis . additional file 4: figure s <dig> shows that the fold changes of transcript expression levels measured by qrt-pcr and rna-seq analyses were highly correlated  with statistical significance .

degs up-regulated in infected pine stem
to understand the potential roles of degs in biological process, fisher’s test  for enrichment of go terms was performed using the cri reference transcriptome as a reference data set. compared to either aeciospores or urediniospores, the infected stem showed up-regulated degs with enriched go terms of biosynthetic process , metabolic process , gene expression and translation  . the degs contributing to enriched biosynthetic processes include a large number of genes encoding various ribosomal proteins, histones, transcriptional factors, and enzymes for biosynthesis of macromolecules , amino acids, fatty acids, lipids, steroids, sugar, atp, and others . protein synthesis from transcription to posttranslational modification seems to be a major process in the infected pine stem tissues. among multiple families of up-regulated transcription factors, fork-head box  proteins are a family of transcription factors that play important roles in regulating the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. active protein synthesis was further evidenced by the strong induction of many ribosomal proteins and other components in translation. the up-regulated metabolic genes were largely involved in dna and carbohydrate metabolism. a number of transcripts associated with transposons and retrotransposons were also detected to be over-presented in infected stem tissues .fig.  <dig> enrichment analysis of gene ontology  terms for up-regulated genes at three cronartium ribicola life cycle stages: aeciospore, urediniospore and inplanta mycelium growth in infected pinus monticola stem tissues. fisher’s test was performed using cri reference transcriptome as reference . go terms involved in biological process include: go: <dig>  cellular response to stimulus; go: <dig>  single organism signaling; go: <dig>  regulation of cellular process; go: <dig>  signal transduction; go: <dig>  cell communication; go: <dig>  signaling; go: <dig>  biosynthetic process; go: <dig>  cellular biosynthetic process; go: <dig>  cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process; go: <dig>  organic substance biosynthetic process; go: <dig>  gene expression; go: <dig>  macromolecule biosynthetic process; go: <dig>  metabolic process; go: <dig>  organic substance metabolic process; go: <dig>  primary metabolic process; go: <dig>  protein metabolic process; go: <dig>  cellular protein metabolic process; go: <dig>  translation; go: <dig>  biological regulation; go: <dig>  cell cycle process; go: <dig>  cell division; go: <dig>  cytokinesis; go: <dig>  establishment of localization; go: <dig>  localization; go: <dig>  regulation of biological process; go: <dig>  single-organism cellular process; go: <dig>  single-organism process; go: <dig>  transport



degs up-regulated at life cycle stages of aeciospore and urediniospore development
compared with infected stems,  <dig>  transcripts were up-regulated at the aeciospore stage. go term enrichment analysis by fisher’s test showed aeciospore-upregulated degs participated in signal transduction/response to stimulus  . a few main groups of degs encode for small gtpases, mapk, and histidine kinases .

similarly, there were  <dig>  transcripts up-regulated at the urediniospore stage compared to infected stems. fisher’s test identified  <dig> go terms enriched in these urediniospore-upregulated degs . apart from genes in signal transduction pathways, other urediniospore-upregulated degs were involved in cell division/cytokinesis, regulation of biological processes, and transport/localization. transport families were one of the major components of the urediniospore transcriptome profile,  <dig> of which were upregulated during urediniospore development .

compared with aeciospores,  <dig> degs were developmentally up-regulated at the urediniospore stage. go analysis revealed that these degs have putative functions in organic substance metabolic process, nitrogen compound metabolic process, biosynthetic process, regulation of biological process, establishment of localization, cellular response to stimulus, cellular component biogenesis, single organism signalling, and single-organism developmental process .

identification of cri genes expressed at the early stage of needle infection
rna-seq data from basidiospore-infected wwp needles at  <dig> dpi was used to identify cri genes expressed in compatible  and incompatible  wp-br interactions. a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts were detected in susceptible  and resistant  needles at  <dig> dpi respectively , including transcripts encoding  <dig> unique secreted proteins. a z-test revealed  <dig> transcripts with expression levels significantly higher in resistant needles than in susceptible needles. although they were not well annotated, six of them encoded proteins with distinct domains  for potential functions as identified by interproscan in the blast2go program. in contrast,  <dig> transcripts were detected with expression levels significantly higher in compatible  interactions than in incompatible  interactions,  <dig> of which shared homology with sequences in the ncbi nr database and  <dig> of which were assigned go terms . these annotated degs encoded histones, cyclins, secreted proteins with unknown function , cazymes , proteases, expansins, and enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction process. a large number of these degs are known to be involved in molecular modification of cell walls.

discussion
in planta rna-seq analysis of the wpbr pathosystem
in this study we generated genome-wide transcriptome and secretome profiles of c. ribicola at three stages of its life cycle. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the pathogen transcriptome and dual transcriptomes of pine tissues infected by c. ribicola using rna-seq. in the present study we used an approach of consensus assembly among biological repeats for each sample to remove potentially contaminated raw data for generation of a reference transcriptome. high mapping ratio of rna-seq reads  to the reference transcriptome indicated that this data processing approach using rust fungal spore samples was satisfactory for de novo assembly of a biotrophic pathogen transcriptome without a reference genome sequence. for biotrophic fungi such as cri, using spores for genomics research is much more straightforward than using in-vitro cultures, which tend to be recalcitrant and/or have extremely slow growth rates. blast and go analyses showed that the de novo assembled transcriptome is almost complete, being similar in size to the recently reported transcriptomes of other rust fungi  <cit> . profiling of the cri transcriptomes revealed that the majority of expressed genes  were detectable at the development stage of either aeciospore or urediniospore. over 60 % of the reference transcriptome was expressed at all three life cycle stages analysed in this study.

reassembly of unmapped rna-seq reads from fungal spore cdna libraries using the clc program showed that  <dig>  % of them remained as singletons, and others were de-novo re-assembled into ~ <dig>  short contigs . the largest proportion  of the reassembly might have originated from aphids, some may have fungal origin , and other short contigs likely represent a set of contaminant sequences from host plants  and bacteria  as revealed by blastx analysis at e cut off value of e- <dig> . aphid-like sequences appeared to be associated with some rust-infected ribes leaves where urediniospore samples were collected for rna-seq analysis. reassembly analysis of unmapped reads suggests that extraction of consensus sequences as a reference transcriptome may be an effective strategy for removal of contamination in rna-seq analysis of field or green-house biosamples.

without known reference sequences for host and pathogen genomes, in planta transcriptome analysis is a challenging task  <cit> , especially for the wpbr pathosystem with alternate hosts and a long infection process that can take up to a few years. rna-seq based dual transcriptome profiling has been recently reported on rice blast  <cit>  and target leaf spot of sorghum  <cit> . although infected pine stems exhibited a wide variation of disease symptoms, our rna-seq analysis demonstrated a good reproducibility of the gene expression patterns among sample replicates harvested from multiple infected seedlings. analysis of dual transcriptomes in infected stems revealed a similar coverage of the rust fungal transcriptome as those at spore developmental stages, suggesting that c. ribicola is physiologically active inside the infected host tissues. these results demonstrate that dual transcriptome analysis is efficient in the wpbr pathosystem, and more secreted proteins and candidate effectors were detected in the infected stem than in spore samples. this research strategy also allowed comparison of transcriptome profiles and further identification of degs regulated in planta during mycelial growth, which may be applicable to other biotrophic conifer pathosystems.

c. ribicola candidate effectors
numerous proteins secreted by pathogens are known to function as effectors in modulating host defence and metabolism  <cit> . an effector displays a property of either virulence or avirulence, depending on whether the host plant processes a corresponding immunoreceptor that recognizes the effector. effectors enable pathogens to successfully colonize plant tissues and facilitate disease, but they function as avr factors when the host acquires discrete recognition capabilities that trigger immunity during an incompatible plant-microbe interaction. a repertoire of effectors is believed to collectively suppress plant basal innate immunity through escaping detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns  by specific host receptors, and also to constitute a favourable intercellular habitat for mycelium growth and disease development in susceptible host tissues during compatible plant-microbe interaction  <cit> .

corresponding to major resistance  genes  in different white pine species  <cit> , four cri avr effectors, avcr1-avcr <dig>  are proposed to be recognised by immunoreceptors encoded by the white pine r genes . when infected by an avcr race, the needle tissues at local infection sites exhibit hr featured by rapid programmed cell death in the white pine trees carrying an r gene. in contrast, virulent races  overcome sugar pine cr <dig> and western white pine cr <dig>  respectively  <cit> . effectors vcr <dig> and vcr <dig> are hypothesized to allow cri races to avoid detection by the white pine’s r genes , resulting in successful infection of white pine seedlings with mgr.

most fungal effectors are ssps shorter than  <dig> amino acids in length and rich in cysteine  <cit> . a cri ssp was found to be accumulated during white pine infection  <cit> . however, so far no cri effector has been identified at the molecular level. recently, a few rust fungal effectors have been identified, including four mli avr proteins  <cit> , pgt avrsr <dig>  <cit> , and uromyces fabae transferred protein  <dig>   <cit> . compared with these identified rust fungal effectors, only three cri secreted proteins  were identified as rtp1-homologs. rtp <dig> homologues were reported in at least  <dig> other rust fungi, suggesting that this protein family may play a universal role in biotrophic rust fungi  <cit> . however, whether cri rtp1-homologs have a similar function as protease inhibitor still awaits a further verification.

in this study  <dig> unique secreted proteins were predicted in the cri transcriptome; which is considerably fewer than those reported in mlp, pgt, and c. quercuum f. sp. fusiforme genomes  <cit> . because ~46 % of the putative protein sequences in the cri reference proteome were incomplete, we were unable to identify a complete set of cri secreted proteins in the present study likely due to partial sequences and missed signal peptides. to predict candidate effectors, we used a similar strategy as reported by nemri et al.  <cit> . using this approach with a further search using the phi dataset, we catalogued a total of  <dig>  proteins as candidate effectors in the first draft of the cri proteome; much less than that reported for the other four rust fungi  <cit> . as the phi dataset expands, it is likely that bioinformatics analysis will allow additional candidate effectors to be mined from the genomes or transcriptomes of pathogens. among  <dig>  cri candidate effectors,  <dig>  % of them were characterized using pfam domain annotation and assignment of potential properties due to similarities to known effectors and pathogenicity-related proteins .

among the first draft of cri secretome with  <dig> unique secreted proteins, only  <dig>  possessed distinct pfam-a domains with some functional annotation. similar to secretomes of other biotrophic fungi  <cit>  the cri secretome consisted of two main groups: degrading hydrolases   and putative effectors with unknown function. using a set of candidate effectors available from other rust fungi  <cit> , we compared cri with them and identified  <dig> cronartium-specific secreted proteins . other secreted proteins are conserved among rusts, a large part of which have well-characterized domains, such as proteases, protease inhibitors, and cazymes. these conserved secreted proteins may provide a valuable resource for further understanding evolution of rust pathogenicity.

the lineage-specific secreted proteins, especially those identified as ssps, may contain candidate effectors that are likely to be enriched as determinants of host specificity  <cit> . although most fungal ssps have no functional homology in databases available to date, their sequence features  have been widely used for computational prediction of candidate effectors in fungal genomes or transcriptomes . of all the cri secreted proteins we found,  <dig> were ssps. even though about 82 % of these had no go term hits in a blast2go search, most of them were expressed in planta, suggesting that they may be specific and essential for the pathogenicity and virulence of c. ribicola. those cri lineage-specific ssps provide a repertoire of candidate effectors for molecular identification of vcr or avcr effectors in a future study.

regulatory programming of gene expression during host infection
genome-wide transcriptional profiling has provided a powerful approach to reveal in planta regulation of pathogen virulence factors . in order to provide insights into how the fungus programs its biological processes to cause wpbr, we characterized the cri transcriptome within infected pine stems, noting dynamic changes of expression profiles during infection and disease development relative to expression in the spores. we found that rust fungal genes up-regulated during infection of pine stems were involved in biosynthesis all the way from dna replication/ metabolisms, nucleosome assembly, rna transcription, protein translation, to down-stream biosynthesis of various metabolites .

we observed several transposons, retrotransposons, helicases, and rna-directed dna polymerases were up-regulated in infected stems . gene regulation is even more important than genetic polymorphism for understanding the source of phenotypical virulence diversity in some pathogens. phytophthora ramorum transposable elements showed an isolate-dependent expression pattern, and elevated expression of transposable elements was associated with a ‘non-wild’ phenotype  <cit> . transposable elements and the dna repair system have a dramatic impact on genomic diversity  <cit> . diversity at genomic regions enriched with transposons is one of mechanisms for rapid evolution of novel effectors in pathogenic microbes  <cit> . given that rust mycelium may grow several years inside pine bark tissues, enhanced activities of transposons and retrotransposons may allow these genetic elements to play a pathogenicity-related role in canker disease development.

a series of transcriptional factors showed increased expression in both infected pine stems and infected ribes leaves, but different gene families or different members of the same families were involved in the regulatory networks specific to each host . this suggests that differential expression of transcriptional factors with co-ordinated functions may be a regulatory mechanism for the rust fungus to fine tune its growth and development on different hosts. furthermore, regulatory programming in infected ribes was integrated with many other signalling components, probably up-stream of transcriptional factors, including histone modification, gtase-mediated signalling, mapk cascade, etc. like genomes of other rust fungi  <cit> , we identified a large variety of gene families coding for signal transduction pathways in c. ribicola. among these signalling gene families, the superfamily of protein kinases was most abundant in the repertoire of cri candidate effectors. protein kinases function in many cellular processes, including metabolism, transcription, cell cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell movement, apoptosis, and differentiation. a non-pathogenic u. maydis mutant was restored its pathogenicity by complementation with p. triticina ptmapk <dig>  <cit> . this highlights the importance of energy dependent signaling cascades during ribes infection, supporting the assumption that these gene families are involved in signal perception mechanisms during rust fungal urediniospore development  <cit> .

c. ribicola gene expression at early stages of infection in pine needle
rust fungal genes highly expressed at the early needle infection stage may be of pathogenic importance for establishment of infection colonies inside host tissues. using rna-seq data generated previously  <cit> , we detected difference of rust fungal gene expression between compatible  and incompatible  interactions at  <dig> dpi. although mapped reads  were almost double in resistant needles compared to susceptible needles, the number of transcripts detected in susceptible needles  was more than double that in resistant needles.

because only ~6 % of total rna-seq reads were derived from expressed rust fungal genes in the infected pine needles at an early infection stage , it could not be compared with other stages of the rust life cycle . using infected pine needles, we compared rust fungal gene expression between compatible and incompatible interactions. degs significantly upregulated in susceptible needles included a high number of transcripts encoding cell wall-degrading/modifying enzymes such as cazymes , proteases, expansin, copper radical oxidases, and a lot of other secreted proteins with unknown function. most enzymes that act on components of the plant cell wall belong to the gh superfamily. ghs are increasingly being documented as virulence factors in pathogens, including enzymes of nine gh families   <cit> . at least  <dig> gh families are reported in fungi  <cit> . during the early stages of wp-br interactions, members of five gh families and one cmb family were significantly induced, including exo-β- <dig> -glucanase , endo- <dig> -β-glucanase , endo- <dig> -β-glucosidase , peptidoglycan lyase , β- <dig> -xylanase , and cmb <dig> with putative binding activities to ghs, gts, xylan, and lectins. these enzymes may modify components of pine cell walls, making fungal penetration easier at the initial stages of needle infection. this result showed that degradation of plant cell macromolecules  is a key process for c. ribicola to invade pine needle tissues. various gh enzymes also have the potential to modify the cell wall of the fungus itself, reducing the effectiveness of the plant enzymes or preventing the elicitation of plant defense responses. for example, ce <dig> genes encode carbohydrate esterases that deacetylate polymeric carbohydrate substrates such as chitin, acetyl xylan and peptidoglycan. deacetylation of peptidoglycan is a mechanism used by pathogens to evade innate host defenses  <cit> .

serine proteases are associated with virulence and nutrient cycling in many pathogens. magnaporthe grisea mutant of a serine protease gene  displays phenotypes of decreased sporulation and appressorial development as well as a greatly attenuated ability to cause disease  <cit> . as one of the most abundant domains in the cri secretome, the domain dpbb- <dig> is found in fungal expansins. concomitantly, two cri expansin genes were highly induced in infected susceptible needles, consistent with a previous report that found expression of p. monticola expansins highly down-regulated in resistant needles post rust infection  <cit> . expansins are well-known in loosening cell walls by inducing the slippage of cellulose micro fibrils. loosening the cell wall is necessary for plant growth, but it also makes the plant vulnerable to pathogen attack. expansins induced by pathogen-secreted indole-3-acetic acid  increase rice disease symptoms  <cit> . a trichoderma expansin is involved in colonization of plant roots and apparently elicits plant defense responses  <cit> . of  <dig> candidate effectors detected at early needle infection stage, many of them were induced as predicted secreted proteins but with unknown function. in general, apoplastic effectors are ssps with primarily inhibitory effects on host proteases, hydrolases, glucanases, and other lytic enzymes, protecting the pathogen cell wall or neutralizing antimicrobial molecules released during the host defense response  <cit> . cell wall modification by cazymes, proteases, expansins, and other proteins seems important for successful fungal colonization in the wpbr pathosystem.

other annotated degs up-regulated during the early stages of needle infection include cyclin, glutathione-s-transferases , cytochrome p450-like tata box binding protein , and copper radical oxidase . cyclins control the progression of cells through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase enzymes, and gsts represent an extended family involved in detoxification processes. tbp plays important endogenous and exogenous roles in oxidative metabolism  <cit> , and cro contributes to extracellular peroxide production, which is linked to hyphal growth and pathogenicity  <cit> . such degs may participate in the cri response to reactive oxygen species released by white pine needle cells as a host defense mechanism. overall, enhanced expression implies that these degs play a role in compatible wp-br interactions, most likely by manipulating host defense  and assisting migration through the host tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
de novo sequencing of the cri transcriptome has been employed to identify cri proteins involved in compatible wp-br infections. global expression profiling of the cri transcriptome, secretome, and effectorome provides novel insights into the molecular pathogenicity of this important forest biotrophic fungus. rna-seq analysis revealed degs at an early infection stage in the needles and at a later infection stage in pine stem cankers. a significant portion of the identified degs were catalogued as candidate effectors, especially those predicted to be secreted proteins. these candidate effectors potentially function in modification of the host cell wall to suppress plant defenses, allowing the rust pathogen to colonize susceptible needle tissues. up-regulation of other rust fungal proteins in the infected stem indicates that the rust fungus has well adapted to the mycelium growth habitat by actively producing enzymes for biosyntheses of various cellular components. these findings support the existing biotrophic pathogenesis model for the wpbr pathosystem, and present a suite of putative effectors potentially functioning at various stages of the rust life cycle, as well as information regarding the differential use of unique members of complex gene families.

because a high number of genes are cronartium-specific and expressed as hypothetical proteins during the disease process, further research is needed to fully understand their involvement in pathogenicity. a future study may focus on identifying variants of cri candidate effectors by global comparison of transcriptomes between avcr and vcr races. as more genetic lineages among populations of this rust fungus are identified, more races will be sequenced to explore association of non-synonymous or functional snps of the candidate effectors with virulence levels. potential pathogenic importance of candidate effectors may be dissected by evolution and association genetics analyses, which will narrow down the number of candidates for functional verification to determine which ones play a key role in resistant or susceptible responses of five-needle pines. characterization of cri effectors will allow a more comprehensive understanding of how rust fungal effectors are recognized by r proteins in white pines. with candidate r genes identified in wwp  <cit> , a final characterization of molecular determinants in disease development will provide effective management tools for operational application in breeding programs of five-needle pines as well as for rating of rust hazard in forest ecosystems.
