BACKGROUND
the dysregulation of microrna  expression in tumors compared with normal counterparts has been observed in many hematologic and solid tumors. several mirnas have been proposed to act as tumor-suppressor or tumor-promoting genes  <cit> , and specific mirna expression signatures with potential prognostic significance have been observed in various primary tumors analysed so far, including colon, lung, pancreatic cancer and neuroblastoma. interestingly, pre-malignant lesions  share identical alterations in mirna expression with carcinoma, suggesting that the acquisition of cancer-specific profiles represents an early event in the malignant process  <cit> .

the role of mirnas in metastasis development is less clearly defined, and contradictory results in this field have been reported, depending on the experimental system studied, the cellular and tissue context, and the step of the metastatic process analysed. a number of so-called oncomirs have been identified for their ability to influence key steps in the metastatic process directly  <cit> . in some cases, sets of metastasis-associated mirnas different from those involved in tumorigenesis have been reported  <cit> . for instance, specific mirnas are involved in circuits regulating the epithelial to mesenchymal transition , a critical step which drives tumor metastasis  <cit> . the major limitation of these studies is that functional data have mainly been collected by means of in vitro assays with tumor cell lines, and only a limited number of studies have been carried out in vivo.

colorectal cancer  is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the usa and europe  <cit> . improved treatment strategies involving surgery, chemo- and radiotherapy have increased the overall survival rates in early stages, but tumor recurrence  is frequent. about one-third of crc patients develop synchronous or metachronous metastases in the liver. the 5-year overall survival rate of patients with crc decreases from 80-90% in the case of locally confined tumors, to 40-60% in locally advanced non-metastatic tumors, and to only 5-10% in metastatic tumors  <cit> . over the last few years, various mirna expression patterns observed in primary colorectal tumors have been associated with tumor stage and patient survival  <cit> , while only few mirnas are common to all reported expression profiles. an interesting example is mir- <dig>  high levels of which in crc compared with normal colon tissue have been associated with poor prognosis and unfavorable therapeutic response, independently of well-established clinical predictors  <cit> . in the same studies, other differentially expressed mirnas, i.e., mir-20a, mir-106a, mir-181b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  were analysed for their prognostic value, but the strength of their association with poor survival was less robust. although clinical and pathological parameters are available for the prognostic stratification of crc patients, more comprehensive knowledge of the basic features of colorectal tumorigenesis and metastatic process may have important implications for both scientific and clinical research and could help in answering a variety of long- standing questions. for instance, the frequency of epigenetic and transcriptional changes occurring in primary versus metastatic lesions is still an open issue.

in this study, we performed a genome-wide expression analysis of both mirna and genes in primary tumors, liver metastases and normal colon mucosa from crc patients, with the aim of discovering modulated mirnas and genes in tumor and metastasis development and to identify the regulatory networks involved in tumor progression.

RESULTS
matched mirna and gene expression in normal colon mucosa, primary colon carcinoma and liver metastasis
we determined the mirna expression profiles of  <dig> samples , obtained from  <dig> patients . this dataset included  <dig> samples belonging to  <dig> patients with matched samples  from the same patient. to understand how changes in mirna expression can influence gene expression, we also examined the expression profiles of  <dig>  genes in  <dig> samples, including 23 n, 30 t and 27 m, and comprising  <dig> matched samples from  <dig> patients . data are available at the geo database .

for both mirna and gene array samples, column  <dig> shows number of patients for whom paired data for various tissue type combinations were available; last column reports total number of samples for each tissue type.

of  <dig> mirnas represented in the array,  <dig> were considered for later analyses after filtering . similarly, 30% of genes with low expression profile variability were filtered out, and  <dig>  genes with moderately to highly variable expression profiles were considered further.

unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on selected mirnas and genes. normal samples clustered together and were relatively well separated from t and m samples, both according to unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis based on mirna and on gene expression data . in fact, only mirna expression profiles separated t from m quite well. considerable per-patient pairing of t and m samples was observed in both dendrograms, in which triplets and pairs of samples from the same patient are shown in the same color . in roughly 25% of patients, the m samples were more similar to the t from which they had derived, rather than to the m samples of other patients. the similarity between t and m samples of the same patient was more evident when samples were classified according to gene expression .

mirna expression variability in the two main transitions in the n-t-m progression was evaluated, by considering the number of mirnas and genes resulting up- or down modulated  or unchanged in the t vs n and in the m vs t comparisons. figure 1b shows that most expression variation took place in the t vs n comparison, revealing two alternative patterns of mirna  expression variation in the progression: i) mirnas  up- or down-modulated in the comparison t vs n and basically stable in m vs t , and ii) mirnas  unchanged in t vs n and modulated in m vs t .

differentially expressed mirnas
many significantly differentially expressed mirnas  can be found during tumor progression. the whole set of samples with mirna expression data was considered in unpaired tests . other sample subsets matched by patient were considered for paired comparisons .

by considering the larger unpaired dataset, we identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dems in t vs n, m vs n and m vs t comparisons, respectively . several mirnas were significantly modulated in more than one contrast. only  <dig> mirnas varied merely when m and t samples were compared . of  <dig> dems shared by at least two comparisons,  <dig> were always under- and  <dig> over-expressed, whereas two mirnas did not follow the same trend in the various comparisons. mir- <dig> and mir-99a, both putative tumor suppressors, were under- expressed in t vs n and over-expressed in m vs t.

identification of dem confirmed that more mirnas are modulated in t vs n than in m vs t comparison; however, dems in metastasis compared with primary tumors may be of great importance, since they include mir-10b, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which are key regulators of several processes related to disease progression, such as dna repair, angiogenesis, hypoxia, emt induction, and cancer recognition by the immune system  <cit> . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the expression profiles of  <dig> mirnas involved in emt which were differentially expressed in t vs n and/or m vs t comparisons.

mirna biogenesis is not impaired during cancer progression
according to our results, during tumor progression we could not detect either general impairment of mirna biogenesis or an overall increase in mirna expression. in fact, in both t vs n and/or m vs t contrasts, we observed a comparable number of up- and down-modulated dems:  <dig> and  <dig> were respectively up- and down-modulated in t vs n; as against  <dig> and  <dig> in m vs t. regarding global mirna expression, when we considered the distribution of all dem expression levels measured in n, t and m, again we could not find any significant differences between the groups .

qrt-pcr validation of mirna expression
to assess the reproducibility of the identified mirnas, we used qrt-pcr to measure the expression of  <dig> mirnas, both in the same  <dig> samples used for mirna expression profiling and in an independent set of  <dig> samples obtained from matched samples of  <dig> patients. we quantified three down-regulated  and two up-regulated mirna . mir- <dig> was the most down-regulated mirna in the t vs n comparison; mir-10b was significantly down-regulated in all three contrasts; mir- <dig> and mir-146a were differentially expressed in the m vs t comparison; and mir- <dig> was up-regulated in the m vs t and m vs n comparisons. for each of the above mirnas, the spearman rank correlation test between qrt-pcr expression estimation  and array-based expression level, in the same  <dig> samples, was significant  . mir- <dig> and mir-146a were also tested on an independent set of  <dig> samples  and the results were fully consistent with microarray-based observations, confirming mir- <dig> down-regulation in t vs n and mir-146a down-regulation in m vs t .

the expression level of mir- <dig>  a mirna which is highly expressed in the liver, was significantly higher in m than in t, suggesting the residual presence of normal liver tissue in metastasis samples. mir- <dig> expression was evaluated in samples in which normal colon mucosa and liver tissue had been mixed in different proportions. qrt- pcr analysis showed that mixing up to 95% of n with 5% of liver tissue caused a significant increase in mir- <dig> expression, compared with samples with 100% of n tissue. this result indicates that the presence of only 5% of liver cells in a sample significantly increases mir- <dig> expression.

identification of most probable mirna targets and definition of regulatory networks modulated in development of tumor and metastasis
we obtained a set of  <dig> samples  with matched mirnas and gene expression data from the same biological sample. the combined analysis of target prediction and expression of  <dig> mirnas with predicted targets and  <dig>  target genes allowed us to reconstruct post-transcriptional regulatory networks describing the most probable regulatory interactions and circuits active in transitions characterizing tumor development and progression.

mirnas interact in several ways with target mrnas, and may exert non-canonical regulatory actions, but they commonly act post-transcriptionally by altering the stability of target mrnas. the expression profile of a given mirna was therefore expected to be inversely correlated with that of its target genes. to identify the most probable mirna targets, we first adopted a classical approach, to enrich a large set of predicted mirna targets in truly regulated genes, by identifying significant negative correlations between mirnas and predicted target expression profiles  <cit> . with the selected threshold on correlation significance , we identified  <dig>  relations, involving  <dig> mirnas and  <dig>  target genes . it should be noted that less than  <dig> out of  <dig>  mirna/target relations predicted by mirsvr turned out to be supported by expression data. indeed, among supported relationships,  <dig>   were based on predicted target sites, which are conserved across species, whereas only one-quarter of the original predictions involved conserved sites .

the number of supported target genes per mirna ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  with an average value of  <dig> . about half the genes were supported targets of only one specific mirna, whereas other genes were putatively regulated by up to  <dig> different mirnas.

within the whole group of supported target genes, of particular importance are the various subsets of genes significantly differentially expressed , which may be viewed as the prominent effects of post-transcriptional regulatory action exerted by mirnas.

as previously stated, in the unpaired analysis only  <dig> mirnas appeared to be significantly modulated in the transition from primary tumor to metastasis, whereas the number of dems observed in the comparison between normal tissue and primary tumor and metastasis was higher . it is reasonable to assume that dems, being moderately to highly expressed in all the considered samples and those most variable in each contrast, are responsible for most target repression. thus, for the t vs n and m vs n comparisons, we focused only on dems up- and down-regulated in each contrast with a fold change  >  <dig> and with an average expression over background in at least one of the two contrasted groups. the intersection between the post- transcriptional network and the results of mirna differential expression analysis induced various sub-networks, describing post-transcriptional regulatory circuits involving those mirnas whose expression variation may be important for tumor development and progression. figures 2a and 3a show post-transcriptional regulatory networks with mirnas differentially expressed in the t vs n comparison and their supported relations with target genes. two network components are observed, involving respectively  <dig> up-regulated  and  <dig> down-regulated  dems. the component regarding the  <dig> up-regulated mirnas was smaller, and a large fraction of genes appeared to be regulated by mir- <dig>  the largest component involved  <dig> down-regulated dems, which putatively regulated a number of targets about twice as high as that observed for the whole set of mirnas. a large proportion of the predicted target genes were indeed significantly differentially expressed. this was more evident for the up-regulated mirna component, in which  <dig> down- regulated degs accounted for 27% of the supported targets of up-regulated dems. conversely, our analysis predicted that only a few genes would be targets of more than one up-regulated mirna. among the interactions predicted between mirna and target genes identified in the t vs n regulatory network we considered the relationship between mir- <dig> and c-myc. qrt-pcr analysis of the entire set of samples confirmed the opposite behavior of mir- <dig> and c-myc in tumour progression .

the network involving five dems observed in the m vs t comparison and their supported target genes was small and consisted of five unconnected components . no degs were observed among the supported targets of dems in the t to m transition. these results further support the concept that the main change in the transcriptome occurs early in the crc progression.

mir-10b expression in metastases: potential association with survival
the  <dig> mirnas included in the tn and mt networks  were considered for survival analysis. the expression of mir-10b measured in liver metastasis showed a statistically significant association with the survival of patients affected with stage iv crc . the effect of mir-10b on prognosis is given in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  which shows that patients with high levels of mir-10b expression in their metastatic disease have a shorter time to event  compared with those with low levels . in our study, the expression levels of mir-10b measured in primary tumors had no significant impact on prognosis.

mir- <dig> controls entpd5
mir- <dig> was one of the most upregulated dems in the t vs n contrast. among its predicted target genes we focused on entpd <dig>  due to the involvement of the gene product in energy metabolism. since entpd <dig> resulted significantly down-regulated in our analysis, and another study provided support for downregulation during cancer progression  <cit> , we decided to study the relationship between mir- <dig> and its predicted target gene entpd <dig>  to investigate the opposite behavior of the mirna and its target gene, we performed qrt-pcr to measure mir- <dig> and entpd <dig> expression in a panel of five cell lines . as shown in figure 2b, all tumor cell lines showed an inverse correlation  between high expression of mir- <dig> and low expression of entpd <dig>  this result not only confirms the microarray profiling data but also suggests a role of the anti-correlated relationship in conferring some advantageous properties to the tumor cells. we next wanted to provide support to the direct targeting of entpd <dig> by mir- <dig>  to this end, we performed a luciferase reporter assay in hek293t cells transfected with a construct containing the firefly luciferase gene fused to the 3′-utr of entpd <dig> . when cells were co-transfected with mir- <dig>  a 50% reduction in luciferase expression was observed, compared with cells transfected with negative control rna or pmir-entpd <dig> only .

mirna modulated kegg pathways
for the t vs n contrast, we identified pathways enriched in gene targets of dems, the expression of which changes in the comparisons, and in deg targets of dems, with only partially overlapping results. some pathways, such as “cell cycle”, “purine metabolism” and “pathways in cancer”, were found in both cases, whereas others, such as “p <dig> signaling” was identified by the first, less conservative strategy. conversely, “wnt signaling” and “colorectal cancer” pathways were found to be specifically enriched in deg targets of dems . it should be noted that “pathways in cancer” is a collection of many pathways, including various cancer hallmarks such as emt, and is an indication that many important processes may be under the control of identified mirnas.

mixed regulatory circuits involving interplay of mirnas and transcription factors contain many “cancer genes”
mirnas regulate target genes mainly at the post-transcriptional level, operating in highly interconnected regulatory networks and pathways, with complex cross-talk of mirnas and transcription factors , which are frequently master regulators of biological processes. mirna expression can be activated or repressed by transcription factors , whereas mrnas encoding tfs can be silenced by mirnas. in many cases, key mixed regulatory circuits involve mirnas, tfs and common target genes. thus, mirnas and tfs can form feedback or feedforward loops, cooperating to switch or tune gene expression.

to account for the interplay of mirnas and tfs, we have recently developed a new method for the integrated analysis of target prediction, magia <dig>  <cit> , which allows one to dissect regulatory complexity by exploiting target predictions, in combination with information on experimentally validated tf-mirna and tf-gene interactions, and which can identify both negative and positive expression profile correlations. by applying this method to the matched expression profiles of all genes and to the  <dig> dems in tn and/or mt comparisons, we were able to reconstruct mixed regulatory networks involving mirnas and tfs. our results show that  <dig> mirnas are involved in the strongest  <dig> interactions identified as significant by magia <dig> . then, we focused on the identification of two types of triangular mixed circuits representing putative feed-forward or feed-back loops with interplay between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation:  circuits in which one tf regulates both a given mirna and its target gene, and  circuits in which one mirna regulates both a given tf and its regulated gene. additional file 1: figure s7b reports  <dig> significant mixed circuits involving five distinct mirnas which interact with  <dig> tfs and  <dig> non-tf protein-coding genes.

discussion
a straightforward interpretation of the data published thus far is complicated by the relatively small overlap between results obtained with differing analytical platforms, sample cohorts and bioinformatics methods  <cit> . in this study, we carried out a genome-wide integrative analysis of mirna and gene expression profiles in  <dig> crc samples, including normal colon mucosa, primary tumor and liver metastasis, in order to identify mirna-gene relationships significantly supported by expression data and involving differentially expressed mirnas, with the ultimate aim of discovering regulatory circuits and mirna-affected cellular pathways specifically associated with tumor progression.

as shown in breast cancer by farazi et al.  <cit> , we observed that both mirna and gene expression profiles efficiently separate tumor from normal samples. however, mirnas proved to be more informative than genes in distinguishing primary colorectal tumors from liver metastases. interestingly, gene expression profiles from tumor and metastatic samples obtained from the same patient tended to cluster together. thus, based on its gene expression profile, a liver metastasis is more similar to the matched primary tumor than to the liver metastases of other patients, suggesting that metastasis development is a patient-specific process.

the large majority of mirnas and genes with varied expression in the t vs n comparison remain stable after metastasis development . three-quarters of mirnas modulated in the m vs t comparison are invariant in the t vs n comparison , whereas only 50% of genes are modulated in the m vs t comparison but not in the previous one.

dems between sample classes were identified, considering the whole set of samples and the smaller group of per-patient matched samples in parallel. the six- fold lower number of dems observed in the m vs t contrast, compared with t vs n  contrasts, indirectly indicates the similarity between tumor and metastatic tissues. this is particularly remarkable also considering that, as discussed for mir- <dig>  a normal liver contribution to m transcriptome cannot be completely ruled out.

it has been hypothesized that mirna down-regulation fosters invasive and metastatic behavior of cancer cells, since overall reduction of mirna expression levels has been reported as a general trait of human cancers  <cit> , and repression of mirna biogenesis in cancer cell lines promotes cell proliferation and invasion  <cit> . in contrast, volinia et al.  <cit>  showed that the most common event in solid tumors is gain in mirna expression, whereas farazi et al.  <cit> , comparing normal and cancer tissues, did not detect any change in total mirna content. we did not observe any prevalence of up- or down-regulation of mirnas in our tumor samples, either when considering the numbers of up- and down-regulated mirnas  or when comparing the distributions of absolute expression values of dems in the same contrast.

mirnas differentially expressed between tumor and normal mucosa include ones previously described as members of a “signature” common to various types of solid tumors  <cit> . many of them have also been implicated in the molecular and biological processes which drive tumorigenesis in crc . relevant examples are mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-125b and mir- <dig> , the mir-17- <dig> cluster, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> , the mir- <dig> cluster and mir- <dig> , and mir- <dig> . interestingly, mir-139-5p, the most down-regulated in the t vs n comparison, has very recently been identified as a member of a signature predictive of the clinical aggressiveness of stage ii crc  <cit> ; in addition, mir- <dig>  the most up-regulated together with mir- <dig> in the same comparison, has been identified for its ability to distinguish crc by means of proficient or deficient dna mismatch repair machinery  <cit> . for some of these mirnas, the tumor-promoting or -suppressing functions in both crc and other tumors have already been suggested. however, considering the large number of mrnas regulated by each mirna, it is very likely that two or more genes from different molecular pathways may be altered in their expression and, considering the tissue specificity of mirna activity, strict classification of cancer-associated mirnas into onco- or tumor-suppressor mirnas may be an over- simplification. a clear-cut example is mir-10b: the expression of this mirna has been correlated with migration and invasion in esophageal cancer cell lines and in breast cancer patients, thus suggesting its tumor-promoting role  <cit> . however, different results have recently been reported in gastric cancer, in which the silencing of mirna-10b by methylation was associated with an increase in tumor cell growth through the activation of the oncogene mapre   <cit> . matching this report, but in contrast with others  <cit> , in our dataset mir-10b was down-regulated not only in the t vs n comparison but also in that of m vs t. mir-10b is one of the mirnas known to be which is important in the emt transition, and is involved in cell cycle regulation as well as in cancer recognition by the immune system  <cit> . it has several predicted targets according to the reconstructed networks, including two genes encoding proteins involved in ribosomal rna biogenesis: utp <dig> encodes the u <dig> small ribonucleoprotein homolog. dkc <dig> encodes dyskerin, an essential nucleolar protein involved in cell proliferation, where it is required for the pseudo-uridylation of ribosomal rna molecules, and for stabilization of the telomerase rna component. dyskerin overexpression has been recognized as a negative prognostic factor in advanced stage hepatocellular carcinomas  <cit> .

although purely exploratory in nature, due to the relatively low number of subjects analysed, our data support the prognostic value of mir-10b , in line with available evidence regarding the role played by this microrna in cancer biology, according to both preclinical  <cit>  and clinical models  <cit> . mir-10b over-expression has been associated not only with enhanced aggressiveness of malignant cells in a variety of experimental models  <cit> , but also with worse prognosis in patients with breast  <cit>  and pancreatic carcinoma  <cit> . to our knowledge, our results suggest for the first time the potential involvement of mir-10b in crc, with special regard to the modulation of the biological behavior of metastatic disease, and deserve further investigation.

when t and m samples were compared in unpaired analyses, only  <dig> over- and  <dig> under-expressed mirnas were obtained. two mirna pairs were characterized by inverse down- modulation in the tumor toward metastasis transition: mir- <dig> and mir-99a according to the unpaired comparison.

the similarity in mirna expression in later stages of tumor progression may reflect the need to maintain the tumor-specific processes required for tumorigenesis and cancer progression. however, it should be emphasized that any malignant tumor is made up of a heterogeneous cell population and that the differences measured in gene profiling experiments are thus the result of average changes occurring within the tumor.

the integrated analysis method has proved to be very useful in previous studies with relatively limited numbers of samples, but was expected to be more powerful when applied to large matched mirna-gene expression datasets, as in this study . in fact, after controlling for multiple testing and using a stringent significance criterion , we were able to identify a set of  <dig>  trustworthy mirna-target relations involving  <dig>  of  <dig> selected mirnas. we then defined a putative post-transcriptional regulatory network in the light of the information regarding differentially expressed mirnas and genes in the t vs n and m vs t comparisons. the t vs n network includes two components  involving respectively  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down- regulated mirnas together with their putative target genes, some of which are significantly differentially expressed in the same contrast. the biological meaning of the smaller component , pertaining to the  <dig> mirnas up-modulated in the t vs n contrast, is evidenced by the large proportion of significantly modulated genes among the set of predicted target genes represented in the network. this observation emphasizes the fact that the pure number of up- or down-regulated mirnas may not really be important in predicting the effect of mirna regulation on cell behavior, for which gene expression is a proxy. some genes are shared predicted targets of different mirnas: the pdcd <dig> gene, a tumor suppressor gene, appears to be the target of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  all up- regulated in the t vs n comparison.

the interplay between the sub-networks suggested to be modulated by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> deserves comment. mir- <dig> is an oncomir whose role in “licensing” and supporting the neoplastic process from the earliest step of tumorigenesis is well-known in several types of solid tumors; its over-expression has in fact been detected in pre-neoplastic lesions of colon mucosa and in advanced adenocarcinomas  <cit> . the connection between mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> is particularly intriguing, in the light of the role of mir- <dig> in cytoskeleton reorganization, a process which favors the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and fosters cell proliferation and invasion. among the predicted mir- <dig> targets, entpd <dig> was differentially down-regulated in our analysis. the gene product is a member of the family of ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase  enzymes which hydrolyse extracellular tri- and diphosphonucleosides, are components of cellular purinergic signaling, and are involved in energy metabolism  <cit> . mikula et al. recently showed that both entpd <dig> mrna and protein levels progressively decrease during the transition from normal colon mucosa, through adenoma to adenocarcinoma  <cit> . this finding is in line with our results, which also indicate mir- <dig> as a possible regulator of entpd <dig> expression.

the post-transcriptional regulatory network with mirnas differentially expressed in the comparison of m vs t was smaller: only  <dig> dems were modulated, each defining a network component . the substantial overlap of mirnas observed to be differentially expressed in t vs n and m vs t comparisons, the absence of differentially expressed genes in the mt network, together with the paucity of pathways significantly modulated in the same comparison  suggest a limited role of mirnas in metastasis development, or in alternative a regulatory influence operating mainly at the translational level. this result again stresses the strict dependency of malignant cells on early molecular events acquired during tumorigenesis. in this respect, we observed that  <dig> mirnas involved in emt varied during tumor progression:  <dig> were differentially expressed in primary tumors compared with normal tissue and one in liver metastasis compared with primary tumor, and one, mir-10b, was common to both comparisons, as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we observed that the expression of many dems involved in emt was modulated in tumor development  and then remained stable or at similar levels in metastasis. we identified various kegg pathways modulated in the t vs n contrasts by examining the expression profiles of all genes supported as targets of dems. the implementation of a method based on gene sets allowed us to identify significantly modulated pathways, rather than simply enriched in genes representing the target of specific mirna groups. for instance, focusing on t vs n up-regulated dems, mir- <dig> is involved together with mir- <dig>  mir-18a, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the modulation of cancer-related pathways, and with mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in the reprogramming of energy metabolism , in which various down-modulated degs were found, including entpd <dig> . at the same time, mir- <dig> was grouped in the cell cycle pathway together with down-regulated mirnas. in this way, it may directly regulate cdkn2b  and collaborate with down- regulated mirnas such as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  in modulating key genes such as cdc25b, myc and prkdc, involved in cell cycle progression checkpoints and dna damage response .

furthermore, we reconstructed mixed regulatory networks and specific circuits involving mirnas, tfs and common target genes. among some of the most significant interactions in the mixed network associated with the strongest correlations, we found the oncogenes meis <dig> and myc, rbms <dig> , svep <dig> , lpp , casp <dig>  and the validated relation mir-145/fli <dig>  involving a well-known “cancer gene”.

these circuits show some of the top interactions involving mirnas, tfs and common target genes. an interesting network component includes mir- <dig>  the tf meis <dig>  and the rev3l gene , all down-regulated in ntm progression. it is known that inhibition of rev <dig> expression induces persistent dna damage and growth arrest in cancer cells  <cit> .

connected circuits involve sox <dig>  an important cancer gene, a tf which antagonizes β-catenin, inhibits tcf activity in cancer cells and modulates cell proliferation  <cit> . the other component comprises several circuits involving mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> together with nf <dig> , tfap <dig> , myc and hnf1a, and common target genes, which can mainly be classified as cancer genes.

CONCLUSIONS
using a large dataset of matched mirna and gene expression profiles in normal mucosa, primary cancer and metastasis, we describe the interplay of modulated mirna groups in the regulation of gene expression, which in turn affects modulated pathways important for tumor development. the suppressor activity of mir- <dig> on the entpd <dig> gene was identified for the first time and confirmed in an independent set of samples.
