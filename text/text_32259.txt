BACKGROUND
linear regression models have been shown to be accurate in predicting drug susceptibility from the hiv- <dig> viral genotype, by calculating the inhibitory concentration 50%  log fold-change  phenotype as a linear combination of parameters, which are mutations  <cit>  and interaction terms   <cit> . the coefficients of these parameters are named resistance weight factors , and they quantify the effect on the log fc of the mutations and mutation pairs. to generate models that are able to make predictions for future genotypes, ideally only resistance associated mutations are selected for the models. as it is not feasible to explore all possible subsets of mutations, stepwise regression is used to incrementally generate a series of regression models by addition or removal of mutations in each step. different performance criteria exist to select one final linear regression model from this series  <cit> . in  <cit>  standard stepwise regression was applied, selecting mutations based on significance with the f-test using predefined p-values. however, since correction for multiple significance-testing is not taken into account and because p-value thresholds are arbitrary, other selection criteria are preferred. information criteria exist that balance accuracy and parsimony by penalizing for the number of parameters in the models. information criteria commonly used are akaike information criterion  and schwarz bayesian criterion  with the penalty in sbc being more severe than in aic. although standard stepwise regression is a fast method in generating a model, the model found may be too complex by containing redundant information. therefore, techniques are required that increase the stability of subset selection in linear regression. in  <cit>  bootstrap aggregation  was presented where an averaged prediction is made using multiple models generated on random re-samples of the original data set with replacement   <cit> . in  <cit>  the bootstrap was integrated in the automatic selection procedure itself as parameters were sequentially added according to the proportion of bootstrap models in which they were selected. we investigated whether cross-validation  <cit>  could be used as a less computationally intensive re-sampling technique than bootstrapping to reduce the complexity of the linear regression models while maintaining accuracy and adding to interpretability by generating only one regression model. as such, we aimed for an improvement in reliability of information extracted from the models, in this case the identification of novel mutations that cause resistance to anti-hiv drugs. in this article we use virtualphenotype™-lm   <cit>  as a reference prediction model. since june  <dig>  virtualphenotype™-lm has been a linear regression model that predicts the log fc based on mutations  and mutation pairs . we propose a more robust selection procedure by making two major changes to this reference approach. first, models were developed directly in second-order: interaction terms could be selected as soon as the constituting mutations were both present as first-order effect. second, mutations or interaction terms were selected by repeatedly applying 3-fold cross-validation. in this article we refer to this method as 3f. repeated cross-validation was presented as a way to reduce variability in the prediction error estimate  <cit> . moreover, as shown in  <cit> , repeated multi-fold cross-validation leads to better model selection when increasing the size of the validation set. to evaluate the generalizability of the models, the prediction error was calculated on genotypes in an unseen data set with available measured phenotypes.

after generating linear models with reduced complexity we were able to effectively identify novel mutations associated with nnrti resistance. the individual contribution to resistance of these mutations was experimentally validated by making site-directed mutants and determining in vitro resistance levels.

RESULTS
reverse transcriptase inhibitors
for the reverse transcriptase inhibitors  a 3f model with lower complexity  than the reference was found for azt, 3tc, d4t, abc, ftc, nvp, efv and etr . for the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors  class of drugs the reduction in interaction terms and mutations used in 3f versus reference was  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. for the nnrti class of drugs the 3f method was even more effective in reducing the complexity: the reduction in interaction terms and mutations was  <dig> % and 26%, respectively. for all rti with exception of azt the 3f performance on unseen data equalled the reference  or was better than the reference  . moreover, the 3f model performance as compared to reference was maintained in subsets of unseen data samples, including the subset with one or more mutations included only in the reference model. although the azt 3f model had a lower sbc value on the training set than the reference, the averaged squared error on the unseen data was  <dig> % higher in 3f. the reduction in the azt 3f model compared to the reference of  <dig> % interaction terms and  <dig> % mutations thus resulted in 3f underfitting. nevertheless, for azt the concordance in susceptibility calls on the unseen data between 3f and reference was  <dig> % and there were no 'major' discordances  between the two approaches. in contrast, the etr reference model had a lower sbc value on the training set than the 3f model but used  <dig>  times more interaction terms and  <dig>  times more mutations than the 3f model, thus implying reference overfitting. here, the concordance in susceptibility calls between the two approaches was  <dig> %, with one major discordance . an increase in the ratio of interaction terms versus single terms in a 3f rt inhibitor model had no significant impact on the 3f performance compared with the reference . in total,  <dig> and  <dig> different mutations were used as single terms in the nrti and nnrti 3f models, respectively . the latter include all of the  <dig> nnrti resistance-associated mutations identified in  <cit> , with the exception of 179g, 227c, and 236l. seventy-two rt mutations were present as single terms in both nrti and nnrti 3f models, including the highly prevalent mutations 103n and 184v. three interaction terms were common between the azt 3f model and one or more of the nnrti 3f models: 103n&181c, 103n&184v and 215y&219e. some rare variants at rt position  <dig> were identified with high rwf and relatively high standard error: 181f, 181g and 181s .

linear discriminant analysis  was conducted to compare the predicted fc distribution of genotypes with a mutation from the list compiled in  <cit>  to the genotypes having the wild-type amino acid at the corresponding position. mutations with the highest impact  on nnrti resistance are shown in figure  <dig>  ranking by impact  was largely similar when comparing the 3f models to the reference, and the rwf were also very similar in both approaches. however, some clear differences between 3f and reference were observed. for example, for efv, 190q  had more impact in 3f . for etr, mutation 179f had more impact in 3f than in the reference, although the mutation was not present as first-order effect in the 3f model . to detect novel nnrti resistance-associated mutations a similar lda was conducted for the remaining  <dig> rt mutations from the list of  <dig> found as first-order effect in the nnrti 3f models but not in the nrti 3f models. we ranked these novel mutations by their impact on nnrti resistance, and retained the top  <dig> for further analysis as described in the next section.

novel resistance-associated mutations
forty novel nnrti resistance-associated mutations were found satisfying the following criteria: lda cutoff >  <dig>  for all of the nnrtis, rwf >  <dig> in the 3f model of at least one of the nnrtis, and rwf ≮  <dig> in any 3f model of nvp, efv or etr . the mutation with the highest impact  was 179m and occurred relatively rarely  in the lda data set containing approximately  <dig>  genotypes. novel mutations that were more frequent with an impact >  <dig>  were 376s, 138a and 357t. mutation 138a has recently been recognized as an etr resistance associated mutation  <cit> . site-directed mutants were made for a selection of the novel mutations. their resistance contribution was analyzed by looking at the mutant's fc relative to a drug-specific biological cutoff , used to separate viruses that are susceptible from those that show signs of resistance  <cit> . when comparing etr to the other two nnrtis in table  <dig> in most cases the lda f <dig> value for etr was higher than for efv and nvp ). however, the in vitro effect of the site-directed single mutations was, with exception of 138a, always below the bco for etr, while this was not the case for efv and nvp. sdms 100v, 190t, 101a and 101d had measured fc values above the bco for nvp  and efv . sdm 139r had an fc value above the bco for nvp only. for the sdm 138a, the highest fc values measured were  <dig> , ,  <dig> ,  and  <dig> , ). other mutations found with elevated fc for at least one of the nnrtis were 221l, 219h, 219d, 376s, 102l, 101n, 234i, 382t, 139k and 241m.

as these novel mutations frequently co-occur with known resistance-associated mutations, we also studied their effect in genetic background containing such mutations. the virco database of clinical isolates was searched for the most appropriate genetic backgrounds to test each of the novel mutations for their effect on nnrti resistance  <cit> . for the mutations 139r, 219d and 219h we looked at their contributions to resistance in combination with the highest-impact nnrti resistance mutants 103n and 181c  for 103n and 181c). the following site-directed mutants were tested for all nnrtis: 103n, 103n+181c, 139r+103n+181c, 219d+103n+181c and 219h+103n+181c . while for nvp and efv all of the above combinations were resistant, for etr the single mutation 103n and the combination 103n+181c were susceptible with mean fc values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the limited impact  of 103n on etr resistance was thus confirmed by the site-directed mutant and adding 181c did not result in a fc above the bco. remarkably, all the above triple combinations were found to be resistant for etr, thereby clearly demonstrating the contribution to nnrti resistance of the novel mutations. for etr a  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold increase in fc compared to 103n+181c was seen when adding 139r, 219d and 219h, respectively. for efv a  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase was seen as well. for nvp the contribution to resistance of the novel mutations in combination with 103n+181c could not be confirmed due to ic <dig> values larger than the maximum assay concentration . data for the novel mutations 102l, 138a, 139k, 139r, 179y, 181f, 188f, 221l and 234i tested in different genetic backgrounds can be found in additional file 4: site directed mutants of novel mutations tested for nvp, efv and etr, extending table  <dig> with results of combinations.

mutation 181g was not in the list of novel mutations as it was always found in presence of other amino acids at position  <dig>  in the lda data set. a site-directed mutant, containing 181g only, was made and found to be resistant to nvp  and having fc values of  <dig> - <dig>  for efv and  <dig> - <dig>  for etr .

discussion
in order to quantitatively predict drug resistance from the hiv- <dig> viral genotype we used 3-fold cross-validation for the stepwise selection of model mutations or mutation pairs. importantly, we applied a random division in three parts before each removal step . thus, in the 3f method robustness was achieved by removing model parameters that were not consistently selected under different random divisions. as a consequence, the 3f method can be considered a greedy stepwise approach where the probability of a parameter being removed increases as the model size increases. as we had to generate models for several drugs this computational approach was a practical one for our purpose. nevertheless, to make the model selection less greedy, one might consider repeating the cross-validation at each step multiple times with a different random division in three parts, to improve the estimation of the prediction error.

as our goal was to reduce the complexity and maintain the accuracy of the reference models, we did not investigate defining a stop criterion for the 3f method independent from the reference. instead, we retained all 3f models with better performance  than the reference on the genotype-phenotype data, holding out the two last months. the 3f model with best performance on the hold-out set was then selected as the final model, and the 3f model parameters were recalculated on the genotype-phenotype data including the hold-out set. ultimately, in deciding between different approaches, the evaluation of performance on future observations remains the first priority. therefore we tested the performance of the reference and 3f method on a large unseen genotype-phenotype data set sequenced at virco between september  <dig> and december  <dig>  for the rt inhibitors the 3f method maintained the accuracy of the reference models while reducing complexity of the linear regression models.

we also evaluated the performance of the 3f method for protease inhibitors . an equal performance between 3f and reference was seen for the most recent protease inhibitors tpv and drv, and with both methods the models were less complex than for the other pis. for the older protease inhibitors the performance of the reference approach was better than the 3f approach. this suggests that protease inhibitors for which resistance patterns have become more complex over time also require more complex regression models, thus increasing the importance of interaction terms. this is in conflict with the constraint in the 3f method that allowed only interaction terms of which both first order effects were already present in the model during the stepwise regression.

for the identification of resistance-associated mutations we restricted our attention to the nnrtis. we detected novel variants at nnrti resistance-associated positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  as well as at novel nnrti resistance-associated positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

as genotyping was done up to rt amino acid  position  <dig>  the 3f linear models of the rtis, with exception of 3tc and ftc, also contained connection domain mutations . two out of eight of the connection domain mutations described in  <cit>  to be associated with azt resistance, were found to increase resistance as single term in the azt 3f model: 348i and 360v. in  <cit> , 376s was found to be associated with an increased risk of virological failure to nvp-based therapy in nnrti-naïve patients and we could confirm the in vitro effect on nnrti resistance by site-directed mutagenesis. in  <cit> , resistance predictions for azt, nvp and efv by current genotypic drug resistance interpretation systems were found to be non-inferior when predicting from short rt sequences  compared to full rt sequences. nevertheless, our analysis suggests that there are  <dig> novel nnrti resistance associated connection domain mutations, including 376s and 382t, that could provide more accurate predictions of nnrti drug resistance.

mutations found as a single term in both nrti and nnrti 3f models consisted of mutations at nrti positions associated with nnrti hypersusceptibility  <cit> , including 215y, found to be etr hypersusceptible in the reference and 3f models, of connection domain mutations, including 348i, and of nnrti resistance associated mutations from the list compiled in  <cit> . our 3f models suggest that these latter mutations might have an effect on nrti resistance as well . in this study we were interested in novel nnrti resistance associated mutations and we considered rt mutations found in the nnrti 3f models only.

by making site-directed mutants we compared the resistance effect of mutations as first-order effect in the models with the in vitro effect. these results show that despite the reduction in model complexity for the 3f approach, one must still be cautious when equating linear model coefficients with in vitro effect. for example, mutation 181f has only a small in vitro effect for nvp whereas in the 3f regression model this mutation has a high first-order coefficient. a likely explanation for this is that in the same 3f model interaction terms of 181f with 98g, 103n, 106m, 190a  with a strong predicted resensitizing effect are present as well, canceling out the resistance contribution of 181f as first-order effect. specifically, we could confirm the resensitizing effect of the combination 181f+103n by comparing the resistance levels of sdm 181f+103n and sdm 103n. . the systematic co-occurrence of 181f with known resistance mutations probably resulted in a high ranking for mutation 181f in the list of novel nnrti resistance associated mutations.

as another example for etr 179f is present as a first-order effect with a large resistance coefficient in the reference model whereas in the 3f model 179f is not present as a first-order effect. inspecting this further we found the interaction term 179f&181c to be present with a strong resistance effect in the 3f model, but absent in the reference model. in this case the 3f method was in line with in vitro selection experiments done in  <cit> , where the synergistic effect of 181c and 179f on the decreased susceptibility of etr was already described. moreover, the one genotype with measured resistant phenotype that resulted in a major discordance for etr between 3f  and reference  contained exactly the 179f&181c combination . most of the novel derived nnrti resistance associated mutations had the highest impact  on resistance for etr but a relatively low in vitro effect in comparison with nvp and efv. co-occurrence of multiple resistance associated mutations is needed to cause an elevated etr fc, as exemplified by the sdms containing two known resistance associated mutations and one novel mutation  with fc values above the bco for etr.

CONCLUSIONS
by applying repeated 3-fold cross-validation within the stepwise regression, we could lower the complexity of linear regression models for predicting drug resistance while retaining performance on unseen data. the described 3f method thus proves to be a tractable approach when interpretation of the linear model is an objective. as the 3f method worked particularly well for the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, we derived a list of forty novel nnrti resistance associated mutations. for a selection of the novel mutations we confirmed their in vitro contribution to resistance by site-directed mutagenesis, individually or in combination with known resistance mutations. as most of these novel mutations were found at relative low frequency in patient samples, carefully following up on drug resistance in patients with viruses carrying these mutations may provide more insight in understanding how the virus escapes the current antiretroviral treatment, as well as in the design of novel drugs.
