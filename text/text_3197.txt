BACKGROUND
thiamine  is a water-soluble micronutrient essential for normal cellular functions, growth and development. humans, and other higher eukaryotes, cannot synthesize thiamine but depend on an appropriate dietary intake and absorption of this vitamin. its plasma concentration is regulated by intestinal and renal mechanisms which play a crucial role in regulating body thiamine homeostasis. upon entry into cells, thiamine is quickly converted to its biologically active form, thiamine pyrophosphate  by thiamine pyrophosphokinase . tpp plays a critical role in the carbohydrate and energy metabolism. it functions as a prosthetic group for the mitochondrial enzyme complexes like pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase. in addition, tpp is involved in the cytosolic pentose pathway functioning as coenzyme for transketolase. recently, it became clear that tpp is also important for a less well known pathway, namely the α-oxidation of 3-methyl-branched and straight chain 2-hydroxy long chain fatty acids  <cit> . in this pathway, which is confined to peroxisomes, tpp, together with mg2+, is required for the proper functioning of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-coa lyase , recently renamed to 2-hydroxyacyl-coa lyase  <dig>   <cit> . this peroxisomal matrix protein acts as a tetramer and catalyzes the cleavage of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-coa and 2-hydroxy long chain acyl-coa into formyl-coa and an aldehyde shortened by one carbon  <cit> . so far, hacl <dig> is the only known peroxisomal tpp-dependent enzyme in mammals.

the importance of tpp/thiamine in the α-oxidation pathway is stressed by the deleterious effects seen in rats given a thiamine-deficient diet enriched in phytol  <cit> . phytol is the precursor of phytanic acid and is, under normal conditions, converted to pristanic acid and further β-oxidized in peroxisomes. in thiamine deficient rats, however, phytol administration results in death  <cit> . presently nothing is known about the transport of thiamine or its phosphate esters across the peroxisomal membrane. hence, we analyzed the presence of this vitamin in peroxisomes and verified whether peroxisomes are able to synthesize it starting from thiamine.

RESULTS
studies on the distribution of thiamine and its phosphate esters in animal tissues appeared in the literature a few decades ago. in rat, the distribution of this vitamin has been shown to be tissue specific  <cit> . so far, most consistent data are available for rat brain  <cit> , while less is known about the subcellular localization in rat liver. with regard to tpp, its content in rat brain is reported to be highest in mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions  <cit> , whereas in skeletal muscle  <cit>  and rat liver  <cit>  most tpp is reported as cytosolic.

since the discovery of the tpp-dependent hacl <dig>  it became clear that tpp, and in general the thiamine status of the cell  <cit> , plays an important role in peroxisomal α-oxidation. until now, tpp has never been measured in peroxisomes, nor has its transport over the peroxisomal membrane been considered. this study was undertaken to address these issues.

in mouse and rat liver homogenates, prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, tpp and thiamine were found to be more abundant than tmp . the amount of tpp measured in mouse and rat liver homogenates was  <dig> and  <dig> nmol/g liver, respectively . the latter value is comparable with previously published data  <cit> . when analyzing subcellular fractions of rat liver, about 50% of the tpp was recovered in the cytosol , which is also in agreement with previous data  <cit> . the light mitochondrial fraction l, enriched in peroxisomes and lysosomes, contained only 3% of total hepatic tpp and, when related to its protein content, did not display an enrichment . however, after separating the l-fraction on a nycodenz gradient, the majority of tpp sedimented together with catalase and urate oxidase, markers for peroxisomes, to a high density . as expected  <cit> , hacl <dig> was also recovered in the peroxisomal fractions . in the fraction that, based on the catalase measurement, was mostly enriched in peroxisomes, tpp increased to  <dig> ±  <dig> pmol/mg protein , about twofold more in comparison with the l-fraction . assuming that the peroxisomal compartment accounts for 2– <dig> % of the total hepatic protein content  <cit>  and occupies approximately  <dig> μl per ml of liver  <cit> , one can estimate the intraperoxisomal tpp concentration at approximately 65– <dig> μm. as part of the tpp may leak out of peroxisomes during the fractionation procedure, this value represents a minimal estimation, but appears to be higher than the cytosolic concentration, estimated at 15– <dig> μm assuming that the cytosol accounts for 80% of the hepatocyte volume  <cit> . so on the whole, we can conclude that the peroxisome is a tpp-containing cell compartment that accounts for 2–3% of the total hepatic tpp content. generally, isolated mammalian peroxisomes are devoid of cofactors, given the leaky nature of their membrane after tissue homogenization  <cit> . tpp would be the second example of a cofactor pool, the first one being coa  <cit> . preliminary data indicate that most of the peroxisomal tpp is not in a free form. indeed, when freeze-thawed peroxisomes were subjected to ultrafiltration , only 17% of peroxisomal tpp was recovered in the ultrafiltrate. when the organelles were sonicated in the presence of  <dig> %  triton x- <dig> in order to disrupt the phospholipid bilayer, this value increased to 37%. these results suggest that most tpp is tightly bound to peroxisomal proteins, most likely to hacl <dig>  or membranes. during its purification from rat liver, hacl <dig> appeared to gradually lose bound tpp and its activity could be restored by adding tpp and mgcl <dig> to the assay mixture  <cit> .

the presence of tpp in peroxisomes raises the question whether thiamine or tpp is transported across the peroxisomal membrane. transport of thiamine over the plasma membrane is performed by the high affinity carriers thtr <dig> and thtr <dig>  encoded by the slc19a <dig> and slc19a <dig> gene, respectively. this transport system would also be present in the mitochondrial membrane  <cit>  but nothing is known about a peroxisomal transporter. uptake of thiamine would require a peroxisomal tpk to convert the vitamin into active tpp. to investigate the presence of such a kinase, we analyzed whether tpp could be formed from thiamine intraperoxisomally. the tpk activity profile overlapped with the distribution of lactate dehydrogenase  activity . as ldh is a marker enzyme for the cytosol and tpk activity was absent or too low to be measured reliably in the nycodenz purified peroxisomes , we can conclude that tpk is exclusively cytosolic. this is in accordance with previous results  <cit>  and with computer-based prediction studies, which show no peroxisome targeting signal in the primary amino acid sequence of mammalian tpk. thus, we can conclude that peroxisomal tpp is not the product of an in situ pyrophosphorylation of thiamine, suggesting that tpp has to enter the peroxisome as such.

whether tpp is transported across the peroxisomal membrane via a specific carrier has not been discovered yet. in human mitochondria, song and singleton  <cit>  detected a saturable tpp transport system and the yeast mitochondrial counterpart has been functionally characterized  <cit> . more recently, mitochondrial tpp transport in mammals has been linked to the deoxynucleotide carrier, a protein encoded by the slc25a <dig> gene, mutations in which cause amish lethal microcephaly  <cit> .

in order to better understand peroxisomal metabolism, it would certainly be useful to know more about the translocation mechanism of metabolites and cofactors across the peroxisomal membrane. so far, evidence for functional transporters in mammalian peroxisomes is limited to atp  <cit>  and phosphate carriers  <cit> . with regard to tpp, a carrier has not yet been identified, but one can also envision that the uptake of this vitamin in peroxisomes is linked with the import/tetramerization of hacl <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
using hplc coupled with fluorimetry, we detected and measured, for the first time, the presence of tpp in purified rat liver peroxisomes. in addition, our results show that peroxisomes are devoid of thiamine pyrophosphokinase activity, which implies that vitamin b <dig> is entering the peroxisome in its diphosphorylated form. the tpp transport may be due to the existence of a specific peroxisomal tpp carrier or it may be linked, as a cofactor-protein complex, to the import of the peroxisomal tpp-dependent enzyme hacl <dig>
