BACKGROUND
mass spectrometry  is one of the major proteomics tools of the post-genomic era. protein identification has traditionally been conducted by peptide mass fingerprinting   <cit>  or tandem ms  database searching and, while the former performs well with highly purified samples, the latter is the de facto standard for identifying proteins in complex samples. however, these approaches are only capable of detecting proteins already listed in databases. pmf implicitly assumes that all genes are annotated and that their complete protein sequences, including post-translational modifications, are known; however, in reality, most of these sequences are inadequately represented in existing databases. as alternative approaches, de novo peptide sequencing can be performed by the edman degradation method  <cit> , ms/ms  <cit> , and controlled protein hydrolysis  <cit> . however, although amino-acid sequences can provide specific information that might be of use in pinpointing gene locations  <cit> , de novo sequencing generally requires the interpretation of complex ms/ms spectra. the most common method for protein identification is based on the interrogation of ms/ms-based databases. using this approach, the ms/ms spectra of protein-derived peptide mixtures are matched to theoretical spectra from protein-sequence databases. search engines, such as mascot  <cit>  or sequest  <cit> , generate a score reflecting the probability that a given experimental spectrum originates from a particular peptide. the presence of a related protein in the sample of interest is then inferred from these data. however, there remains a need for novel high-throughput approaches, because de novo sequencing is not suitable for proteome-wide protein identification, and ms/ms database searching alone is prone to generate both false-positive and false-negative results.

recently, novel protein-identification methods that are independent of predefined protein databases have been reported  <cit> . in genome fingerprint scanning , the peptide data are mapped directly onto raw genomic sequences by scanning the pmf data against theoretical peptide masses generated computationally from entire genomes  <cit> . this approach can identify the genomic loci and amino-acid sequences of proteins. however, the major drawback of this method is that many false-positive matches can be generated, because precursor ion masses alone are used to search the genome-wide peptide-fingerprint data.

to reduce the number of false-positive results, and to improve the efficiency of protein identification, we developed a hybrid method we term hybgfs. this approach uses an extended version of the gfs algorithm that includes the product ion masses and liquid-chromatography elution times as additional parameters for peptide identification. experimental tandem mass spectra are searched against theoretical peptide data generated from a complete genome sequence, evaluated statistically, and used for genome scanning. in the current study we validated our hybgfs method using a set of  <dig> recombinant proteins from the e. coli k <dig> strain. a total of  <dig>  of the recombinant proteins were accurately identified and mapped to their correct genomic locations. based on their amino-acid composition, the peptide lc-ets were predicted with an artificial neural network  model and utilized for peptide identification. the hybgfs approach is independent of existing protein databases, in which the coding sequences of proteins are assumed to be established, and simultaneously identifies the genetic loci. moreover, this novel program does not require the manual interpretation of mass spectra; rather, it uses automatically generated mascot  <cit>  generic files, thereby allowing high-throughput analysis to be realized. we suggest that this improved method of peptide identification will find many applications in lc-ms-based proteomics.

RESULTS
generation of an in silico peptide database
we chose e. coli k <dig> to validate hybgfs because extensive genome annotation data are available for this strain and its protein-coding sequences have been accurately determined. to identify proteins without reference to existing databases, we constructed a comprehensive dataset based on genome-sequence information for a total of  <dig> , <dig> in silico peptides. we first recorded the amino-acid sequences, the genomic loci and the calculated mass-to-charge ratio  values of peptides in the dataset. we then included the lc-ets predicted by the ann model . the prediction-accuracy of the trained ann model is shown in figure  <dig>  the correlation coefficient for both the predicted and experimental ets was  <dig>  with a mean prediction error of  <dig>  min .

experimental validation of hybgfs
we tested the accuracy of our method by evaluating its ability to positively identify  <dig> known protein samples. the recombinant proteins were purified and digested and the resulting peptides analyzed by ls-ms/ms. the resultant raw ms/ms spectra were automatically converted into mascot generic format  files using analyst qs software . we used the precursor/product ion m/z values and the lc-ets of the peptides in the mgf files to obtain the computational parameters. the m/z error-tolerance values were ±  <dig> da for the precursor ion and ±  <dig>  min for the lc-et; the latter was calculated as the sum of the mean prediction error and the sd of the error. based on these parameters, hybgfs accurately identified  <dig>  of the  <dig> e. coli proteins tested and their genomic loci without reference to information on protein-coding regions.this result confirms that our method is highly effective for determining both protein identity and gene location.

to demonstrate the value of the product ion m/z values and ets for peptide searching, we repeated these procedures in the absence of one or both of the additional search parameters . when the precursor ion m/z value alone was used, only  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins were correctly identified and the average ranking of the correct protein among the top hits was  <dig> . when we used the lc-et and the precursor ion m/z value together, the number of correctly identified proteins increased to  <dig> and the average hit ranking was  <dig> . when both the precursor- and product ion m/z values were used in the absence of lc-et information,  <dig> of the  <dig> proteins were correctly identified and the average hit ranking was  <dig> . when all  <dig> parameters were applied simultaneously, the results were significantly better:  <dig>  of the proteins were correctly identified and the average hit ranking was  <dig> . it should be noted that under the latter condition, the average hit ranking was mainly due to  <dig> outlier proteins, eda and pfka. we further compared our validation results with mascot search results using the same theoretical orf database and lc-ms/ms data and identical search parameters, i.e.  <dig> missed cleavages, peptide charges  of 1– <dig>  error tolerance of ±  <dig> for precursor, ±  <dig>  for product ion, fixed modification of carboxymethyl, and the esi-qtof instrument . using mascot, we found that  <dig> proteins were correctly identified with top rank and  <dig> were ranked within the top  <dig> candidates. the remaining  <dig> were not identified;  <dig> of these  were also not identified with hybgfs and considered outliers . mascot search parameters have been debated and we were unable to compare directly and discuss the identification ability of mascot and hybgfs based only on these results. however, our hybgfs using all  <dig> parameters  yielded results that were comparable with mascot algorithms.

for comparison, the results searched using mascot software are also shown. each recombinant protein's name we experimentally tested in the validation dataset is listed, as is its ranking in the search results.

to evaluate the identification accuracy at the peptide level, we calculated the positive predictive value  index, i.e. number of true-positive peptide identifications/total number of peptide identifications, of the peptides for each method . we found that the inclusion of all  <dig> parameters  yielded the highest ppv index. we also calculated the specificity and sensitivity of the peptide identifications for each matching criterion . due to the large proportion of negative entries in the dataset  and the difficulties we subsequently encountered in our comparison of specificity, the relative values of the false-positive rate  are also shown. although sensitivity was high for identifications without product ion m/z , the false-positive rate was also high for these  <dig> matching criteria. on the other hand, although sensitivity was low for identifications using all  <dig> indices and for identifications using precursor and product ion m/z, the false-positive rate was drastically  improved compared with the results obtained without product ion m/z matching. we ascribe the better result in the correctly identified protein ranking  to these low false-positive rates.these results indicate the significant effect of product ion matching on identification. the effect of lc-et-based screening is also significant as it reduced the false-positive rates from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  .


relative values of the false-positive  rate are also shown. the highest fp rate  was normalized to  <dig> and other fp rates were represented as the ratio to the normalized value. we used this representation of the fp rate to facilitate easier comparison.

in addition to  <dig> indices we utilized, other lc-ms-derived information that reflects the physicochemical properties of peptides may be usable in hybgfs. for example, parker  <cit>  employed peak intensity information to improve the accuracy of peptide identification in maldi-ms-based proteomics. although a method for the prediction of peptide peak intensity for esi-ms remains to be established, we could use this information for more accurate peptide identification. in addition, the high-resolution mass spectrometric approach is useful. the utility of accurate mass tag- and lc-et prediction in large-scale peptide identification has been discussed elsewhere  <cit> . our hybgfs would further reduce false-positive peptide matches if high-resolution ms were used in conjunction with lc-et prediction.

scalability of hybgfs to other organisms
in higher eukaryotes, e.g. human and rat, the size of individual introns is much larger than in other eukaryotes )  <cit> . furthermore, higher eukaryotes have multiple introns   <cit> , whereas a yeast gene usually has at most one intron  <cit> . due to difficulties in evaluating peptide localization on the genome, the application of gfs methodology to higher eukaryotes comprised of multiple exons remains a considerable challenge  <cit> . it is inherently difficult to identify by the current gfs methodology peptides translated over exon/exon junctions and the existence of alternative splicing variants increases the possibility of such false-negatives. at least 74% of human multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced  <cit>  and in mouse protein-coding transcripts, 79% of splice variations altered the protein product  <cit> . therefore, from a practical perspective, current gfs methods including our hybgfs are not scalable to higher eukaryotes at present. however, hybgfs is not limited to bacteria; we consider it applicable to lower eukaryotes such as yeast and aspergillus, because the intron size and frequency in these organisms are small  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we present a new method for mapping peptide sequences onto their genomic positions using lc-ms/ms data and genome-sequence information. hybgfs does not require predefined protein databases or annotated orf information. our validation results indicate that the use of product ion m/z values and peptide lc-ets in addition to precursor ion m/z values, as employed in the original gfs method, significantly reduces the number of false-positives, a major problem in the traditional gfs method that results in errors in both mapping and protein identification. hybgfs will therefore be useful for large-scale experimental confirmation of coding sequences in genomes without the need for transcriptome-level expression analysis or costly ms database searches.
