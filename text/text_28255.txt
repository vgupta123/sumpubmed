BACKGROUND
species in the genus ocimum are native to africa, south america, and asia, and are valued as aromatic and medicinal plants. essential oils extracted from ocimum spp., such as o. basilicum, o. sanctum, and o. americanum, have anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and larvicidal activities . recently, the transcriptomes of o. basilicum and o. sanctum were assembled and used to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of essential oils and medicinal metabolites  <cit> . in addition to being used for medicinal purposes in some parts of the world , o. americanum var. pilosum of the lamiaceae family is one of the most popular vegetables in anhui and henan provinces in china, where it is frequently grown. o. americanum var. pilosum is very sensitive to chilling injury, however, which limits its growing area and can also dramatically reduce its yield, leading to economic losses for farmers.

low temperature is a major environmental factor determining the growth and productivity of plants. temperate plants are tolerant to chilling temperatures  but are usually intolerant of freezing temperatures   <cit> . for many temperate plant species, a period of exposure to chilling temperatures increases plant tolerance to subsequent freezing conditions in a phenomenon known as “cold acclimation”  <cit> . in contrast, plants of tropical and subtropical origins are intolerant of chilling and freezing temperatures. in response to low temperature, many biochemical and physiological processes change in plants through regulation of cold responsive  gene expression as well as through posttranslational protein modifications. the ice1-cbf-cor transcriptional cascade  is the best characterized pathway for gene regulation under cold conditions in many species  <cit> . in arabidopsis, three transcription factors in the cbf family  are rapidly induced by low temperatures  <cit> . these cbfs can bind to and activate downstream cor genes, such as cor <dig>  cor <dig>  cor <dig>  and kin <dig>  to protect plant cells from freezing damage. the pathway may also be important for chilling tolerance  <cit> . under cold conditions, the expression of cbfs can be regulated by several upstream transcription factors such as ice <dig>  camtas, myb <dig> and ein <dig>  <cit> . the protein kinase ost <dig>  was recently found to phosphorylate ice <dig> under cold stress and to thereby stabilize and activate ice <dig> activity  <cit> . siz <dig> , a sumo  e <dig> ligase, can stabilize ice <dig> through sumoylation  <cit> . ice <dig> protein stability and activity can also be regulated by e <dig> ligase hos <dig> -mediated protein ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation under cold stress  <cit> .

rna-seq technology is increasingly being used to characterize transcriptomic events in plants. rna-seq can provide transcriptomic information in the absence of a reference genome, and thus it is particularly useful in non-model species, whose genomic sequences are often unavailable. for many crops and other economically important plants, a period of unexpected low temperature may cause damage to plants and result in great losses to farmers. recently, a number of studies have characterized cold responsive transcriptomes of these plants, including important crops such as prunus dulcis mill.   <cit> , beta vulgaris l.   <cit>  and poncirus trifoliata  raf.   <cit>  and other plants with high economic value, such as eucalyptus dunnii  <cit> , chrysanthemum nankingense  <cit> , and lilium longiflorum   <cit> . these studies suggested that the gene expression responses of plants to cold are complex and involve numerous cellular processes, such as carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, calcium signaling and hormonal changes .

in this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly of o. americanum var. pilosum and compared its transcriptomes under normal and chilling conditions to investigate how o. americanum var. pilosum responds to low temperature stress. in the de novo assembled transcriptome of o. americanum var. pilosum, we identified  <dig>  active transcribed unigenes and found that the expression of  <dig> unigenes was up- or down-regulated in response to low temperature. to understand the potential involvement of the cbf pathway in the cold response of o. americanum var. pilosum, we reconstructed the cbf pathway by using our de novo assembled transcriptome and compared the expression of cbf pathway factors before and after chilling treatment. we found that none of the identified cor gene orthologs was induced by cold in o. americanum var. pilosum, which is consistent with the cold sensitive phenotype of this plant. in contrast, many of the cold regulated genes have functions related to protein translation and cellular metabolism, suggesting that cold temperature affects this chilling sensitive plant by altering protein synthesis and metabolism.

RESULTS
response of o. americanum var. pilosum to chilling stress
seeds of o. americanum var. pilosum were collected from funan county of anhui province, china. seeds were germinated on ms agar medium. then 5-day-old seedlings were transferred to soil and grown in a growth room with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod at 22 °c. chilling treatment was performed in a climate chamber with a 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod at 4 °c. during chilling treatment, control plants were kept at 22 °c. mint  belonging to the same family with o. americanum var. pilosum was used as a control  in the chilling sensitivity test. as shown in fig. 1a, 10-day-old o. americanum var. pilosum and control plants appeared healthy before they were subjected to chilling stress. after a chilling stress of 4 °c for  <dig> d, the control seedlings but not the o. americanum var. pilosum seedlings survived, indicating that o. americanum var. pilosum is highly susceptible to chilling jury. when 30-day-old plants were subjected to chilling stress, the results once again indicated that chilling sensitivity is greater for o. americanum var. pilosum than for the control .fig.  <dig> chilling sensitivity of  10- and  30-day-old o. americanum var. pilosum plants. mentha spicata was used as the control



rna sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly
total rna was isolated from both untreated  and chilled  30-day-old o. americanum var. pilosum leaves. rna sequencing with illumina hiseq <dig> was performed for two biological replicates of control and chilled samples, which were designated control_rep <dig>  control_rep <dig>  chilling_rep <dig>  and chilling_rep <dig>  about  <dig> million paired-end reads were produced for each rna-seq sample . clean reads were acquired from initial paired-end reads after low quality regions , pcr duplicates, and adaptor sequences were trimmed. for each control sample, approximately  <dig> million clean reads containing a total of  <dig> billion nucleotides were obtained . for each chilling-treated sample, approximately  <dig> million clean reads containing a total of  <dig>  billion nucleotides were obtained . biological replicates produced comparable data .table  <dig> sequencing output statistics in four o. americanum var. pilosum leaf samples from plants that were not chilled  or chilled 



we pooled all high quality reads  from the four samples to perform the de novo transcriptome assembly . with the trinity program  <cit> ,  <dig>  transcripts were assembled with an n <dig> length of 1283 bp, an average transcript length of 958 bp, and a maximal transcript length of  <dig>  bp . we chose the longest isoform of each gene to construct the unigene set. after isoforms were considered, these assembled transcripts were predicted to be produced from a total of  <dig>  unigenes . the mean size of the unigenes was approximate 947 bp, and their lengths ranged from 300 bp to  <dig>  bp . we compared transcriptome of o. americanum var. pilosum with that of another species of ocimum, o. sanctum. previous published transcriptome of o. sanctum was used in this analysis  <cit> . we found that 71 % of unigenes  in o. americanum var. pilosum got hits  in the transcriptome of o. sanctum, suggesting high similarity between these two species. the 29 % of unigenes that don’t get hits may reflect the genomic diversity between the two different species.table  <dig> statistics of transcriptome assembly and predicted unigenes



as indicated by the length distribution of o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes , most unigenes  had <  <dig> nucleotides, and the number of unigenes decreased as gene length increased. genes with only one transcript were considered to be distinct singletons, while genes with multiple transcripts were considered to be distinct clusters. among  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  unigenes were distinct singletons, and about  <dig>  unigenes were distinct clusters.fig.  <dig> the distribution of unigene lengths for o. americanum var. pilosum




annotation and classification of o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes
to identify the putative functions of o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes, we carried out functional annotation by using a blastx search  against several protein databases: ncbi non-redundant  database, swiss-prot database, gene ontology , kyoto encyclopedia of genes, genomes  database, and cluster of orthologous group  database. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  %  were successfully aligned to known proteins in the nr database . in the other four databases ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  unigenes were successfully aligned to known proteins , respectively. overall,  <dig>   unigenes were significantly similar to known proteins in the five databases, while  <dig>   unigenes were not similar to any known protein in the five databases. among the five databases, the nr database produced the largest number of annotations; of the  <dig>  annotated unigenes,  <dig>  were annotated in the nr database. in comparison with other species, o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes showed the highest similarity with sequences from solanum lycopersicum  and vitis vinifera , but also were similar to sequences from other species .table  <dig> annotation statistics of o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes

fig.  <dig> similarity of o. americanum var. pilosum sequences with those of other species



we performed a go analysis to classify the functions of the o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes. a total of  <dig> unigenes were successfully annotated with go terms and were classified into three major go categories: biological processes , cell component , and molecular function . they were further assigned to  <dig> subcategories based on go level  <dig>  the dominant subcategories for the classified genes were ‘cell’  and ‘cell part’  for the cc category; ‘cellular process’ , ‘metabolic process’ , and ‘response to stimulus’  for the bp category; and ‘binding’ , ‘catalytic activity’ , and ‘transporter activity’  for the mf category . to identify active biochemical pathways in o. americanum var. pilosum, kegg analysis was carried out; kegg-annotated unigenes  were classified to  <dig> pathways  . among these pathways, the five most represented were “carbon metabolism”, “biosynthesis of amino acids”, “ribosome”, “protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum”, and “plant-pathogen interaction” .fig.  <dig> histogram of go  classifications of assembled unigenes and up- and down-regulated unigenes of o. americanum var. pilosum in response to low temperature



in summary, all these annotation and classification analyses can provide valuable information to further investigate gene functions, metabolic processes, and active pathways of o. americanum var. pilosum.

differentially expressed genes in chilling-treated o. americanum var. pilosum plants
using our de novo assembled transcriptome as a reference, we identified putative genes expressed in control and chilling-treated plants. in control_rep <dig> and control_rep <dig> samples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed putative genes  were detected, and  <dig> were expressed in both samples. in chilling_rep <dig> and chilling_rep <dig> samples,  <dig>  and  <dig>  expressed putative genes  were detected, and  <dig>  were expressed in both samples. the high similarity between the two biological replicates for either control or chilling-treated samples indicated that the rna-seq results were consistent. the consistency was also supported by fpkm  correlation analysis between the two biological replicates  .

to begin to explore the molecular mechanisms of cold stress response of o. americanum var. pilosum, we identified genes that were differentially expressed in seedlings grown under normal vs. chilling temperatures. compared with the control,  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  with at least 2-fold changes  were identified in chilling-treated samples with the edger package. of these degs,  <dig>  were up-regulated and  <dig>  were down-regulated in chilling-treated plants. functional annotation with five databases was also executed on these degs, and about 86 % of them  were successfully annotated .

about  <dig> up-regulated degs and  <dig> down-regulated degs were successfully annotated with go . their go level  <dig> distributions are shown in fig.  <dig>  up-regulated and down-regulated degs had a similar distribution pattern, which was also similar to that of all go annotated unigenes .

to better understand the biological function and correlation of these degs, we conducted an enrichment analysis with the kegg pathway, which assigned the degs to  <dig> pathways . among these pathways, “ribosome”, “plant hormone signal transduction”, “starch and sucrose metabolism”, and “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” were the most highly represented . the “ribosome” pathway  had the largest number of degs, suggesting that translation in o. americanum var. pilosum is substantially influenced by low temperature. the pathway with the second largest number of degs was “plant hormone signal transduction” , indicating that plant hormones in o. americanum var. pilosum play important roles in the response to chilling stress. sucrose and starch metabolism  was the pathway with the third largest number of degs; this was not surprising because chilling affects carbon assimilation and sucrose contributes to chilling tolerance by stabilizing plasma membranes  <cit> . ocimum spp. are commonly used as spices and as sources of essential oils because these plants synthesize large quantities of phenylpropanoid compounds  <cit> . interestingly, the pathway with the fourth largest number of degs was “phenylpropanoid biosynthesis” , suggesting that the composition of aromatic compounds may change under cold stress.fig.  <dig> kegg pathway classification of differentially expressed unigenes of o. americanum var. pilosum




in general, analyses towards degs in response to cold will help to understand how gene expression in o. americanum var. pilosum is influenced by chilling treatment.

validation of degs in chilling-treated o. americanum var. pilosum plants
we checked the functional annotations of those degs that exhibited the greatest difference in expression in response to chilling treatment. the  <dig> most up- and down-regulated genes and their annotations are listed in table  <dig>  ob_ <dig>  a putative ortholog of pid-binding protein  <dig>  in arabidopsis, was the gene that was most induced by chilling treatment. this indicates an interplay between auxin signaling and cold response in o. americanum var. pilosum because pbp <dig> is related to auxin signaling. more specifically, pbpi can stimulate the autophosphorylation activity of pid  protein serine/threonine kinase, which is a key component in auxin signaling  <cit> , and auxin plays an important role in cold stress inhibition of plant growth and development  <cit> . to validate our rna sequencing results, we performed individual qrt-pcr to examine the expression of the  <dig> most up-regulated genes and the five most down-regulated genes after chilling for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 48 h. all  <dig> up-regulated genes were well induced by chilling, although their expression changed with the length of the chilling treatment . consistent with the rna-seq results, all five of the most down-regulated genes were repressed by chilling . the consistency between qrt-pcr results and rna-seq analyses helps confirm the validity of our de novo assembled transcriptome and our analysis of cold stress regulation of the transcriptome.table  <dig> the  <dig> most up- and down-regulated o. americanum var. pilosum genes after cold treatment

o. americanum var. pilosum unigenes involved in the cbf cold response pathway
the cbf transcriptional cascade is an important pathway for the regulation of gene expression under low temperature in diverse plant species. using our rna-seq data for o. americanum var. pilosum and blastx, we identified cbf-pathway genes with the following parameters: an expectation value of 1e- <dig>  an identity value > 30 %, a coverage value > 80 %, and a protein length difference < 2x. a total of  <dig> unigenes were identified as putative orthologs of genes in the cbf pathway, and their corresponding cbf-pathway orthologs are listed in table  <dig>  in o. americanum var. pilosum, ob_ <dig> and ob_ <dig> were found to be similar to ice <dig>  which can be modified by phosphorylation and sumolation when plants are exposed to low temperature. the enzyme responsible for ice <dig> sumoylation, siz <dig>  has four similar unigenes: ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  and ob_ <dig>  the modified ice <dig> can activate cbf transcription and repress the cbf transcription inhibitor, myb <dig>  in our assembled transcriptome,  <dig> unigenes  with high similarity to the myb <dig> sequence were identified, and six unigenes  were matched to known cbf gene sequences . the degradation of ice <dig> can be facilitated by ubiquitination by hos <dig>  and thus hos <dig> negatively regulates cbf expression. one unigene, ob_ <dig>  had high similarity with hos <dig>  cbfs can regulate the cold induction of zat <dig>  a transcription factor involved in regulating the expression of a subset of cold-responsive genes . two putative zat <dig> orthologs were found in o. americanum var. pilosum: ob_ <dig> and ob_ <dig>  sequences of the following eight expressed unigenes were similar to those of known cor genes, including cor15a, cor <dig>  and kin1: ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  ob_ <dig>  and ob_ <dig> table  <dig> unigenes matched to known cbf-pathway factors

for unigenes with similarity to cbf-pathway factors, normalized transcript levels in control and chilling-treated samples are shown in fig.  <dig>  when >2-fold change was used as a cutoff, two putative ice <dig> orthologs  and one putative cbf <dig> ortholog  were slightly down-regulated, while one putative cbf <dig> ortholog  and two putative zat <dig> orthologs  were up-regulated after chilling treatment. ob_ <dig>  was dramatically induced by chilling treatment , while transcript levels of all the other putative cbf orthologs were very low. cbf can activate zat <dig> . consistent with the induced expression of the putative cbf ortholog , the expression of two putative zat <dig> orthologs  was increased in response to chilling treatment. the transcript levels of the two putative ice <dig> orthologs were reduced to different degrees after chilling treatment, although they both were expressed at low levels in control samples. among the  <dig> putative myb <dig> orthologs, transcript levels for two  were slightly increased by chilling treatment , and this increase might be explained by the decreased expression of its negative regulators, putative ice <dig> orthologs. one putative cbf <dig> ortholog , as a possible target of putative ice <dig> and myb <dig> orthologs, was slightly repressed by chilling treatment. transcript levels of putative siz <dig> and hos <dig> orthologs did not change in response to chilling treatment . interestingly, none of the identified cor orthologs in o. americanum var. pilosum was substantially induced by chilling treatment .fig.  <dig> reconstruction of the cbf pathway in o. americanum var. pilosum and the relative expression of  <dig> unigenes putatively involved in the cbf signaling pathway in response to control and chilling treatment. a diagram showing cbf pathway. b–d relative expression of zat <dig>  cbf, and cor orthologues in control and chilling treatment. for b–d, the results of two biological replicates are shown



CONCLUSIONS
o. americanum var. pilosum is an aromatic plant and a popular vegetable in central and southern parts of china. it is very sensitive to low temperatures. here, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly of o. americanum var. pilosum using the trinity program and obtained  <dig>  assembled unigenes. by analyzing the genome-wide transcriptome under low temperature, we identified several thousand potential cold-responsive unigenes and  <dig> pathways containing degs under chilling treatment. our analysis of the degs suggested that cold temperature significantly affects protein translation and cellular metabolism in this chilling sensitive species. although most genes involved in the ice1-cbf-cor pathway have orthologs in o. americanum var. pilosum, none of the identified orthologs of cor genes was induced by low temperature, which is consistent with the lack of cold tolerance in this plant. in summary, we have profiled the high-resolution expression pattern of o. americanum var. pilosum under normal and chilling conditions. our results should be useful for future research concerning the molecular mechanisms of low temperature responses in o. americanum var. pilosum.
