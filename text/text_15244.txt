BACKGROUND
within the last decade the interdisciplinary field of cultural neuroscience investigating interrelations among culture, mind and the brain has increased tremendously cf.  <cit> . according to chiao and ambady  <cit> , the main goal of cultural neuroscience is to investigate how much of the cultural variation observable in human behavior is traceable to cultural variation, including the biological and neural levels. previous studies reported cultural differences in neural activation for a variety of cognitive functions including picture encoding  <cit> , voting behavior  <cit> , empathy  <cit> , and self-representation  <cit> .

broad consensus exists that culture also asserts a significant impact on the neural correlates of face processing, particularly regarding activation of the amygdala, mostly reporting stronger or sustained activation to out-group faces e.g.,  <cit> ; for review see  <cit> . emotional expressions  have rarely been used in fmri studies addressing culture effects, but play a special role in emotion processing: moriguchi et al.  <cit>  showed differences in the neural processing of fearful faces between caucasian and japanese subjects, with higher activation of the left amygdala in caucasians. chiao et al.  <cit>  presented emotional expressions of japanese and caucasian actors to japanese and caucasian americans and observed significantly elevated amygdala response to in-group expressions of fear in both groups, suggesting a specific sensitivity of the amygdala to optimally respond to facial expressions of fear specific to one’s own cultural group. recently, adams et al.  <cit>  investigated the effect of direct vs. averted eye gaze during processing of fearful caucasian and japanese faces in caucasian american and japanese students. they observed elevated amygdala activation during the averted vs. direct gaze when expressions were posed by in-group posers, while out-group posers elicited stronger amygdala activation during direct vs. averted gaze. these findings reveal a meaningful role of culture in the processing of eye gaze and emotion, and highlight their interactive influences in neural processing. however, gender differences and the impact of gender of poser were not addressed in either study, although mixed samples were investigated and mixed stimuli presented.

recently we reported bilateral amygdala response of asian males and matched european caucasian subjects to caucasian emotional expressions  <cit> . we observed significantly stronger amygdala activation in asian males that was inversely correlated with duration of stay. moreover, a decreased recognition rate of disgust was demonstrated, probably indicating initial problems with a difficult emotion that may be shaped to a greater extent by cultural influences than the other basic emotions. as we only examined male participants, analysis of gender-by-culture interactions on amygdala response was not possible.

gender differences in the activation of the amygdala during facial emotion processing have been documented frequently, albeit with findings being extremely heterogeneous: some studies showed stronger activation in females e.g.,  <cit> , some in males e.g.,  <cit> , and some studies report no significant activation difference e.g.,  <cit> . in sum, these inconsistencies in the level of amygdala activation may be due to the emotions investigated and differences in the methodology employed  and results from a recent meta-analysis across  <dig> fmri studies  <cit>  point to a stronger activation of the right amygdala during facial emotion processing in males. however, studies specifically addressing the interaction of culture and gender on amygdala activation during emotion processing are still missing. more generally, none of the previous neuroimaging studies exploring cultural effects examined gender differences, though most relied on a mixed sample or used mixed stimuli  <cit> .

therefore, in the present study behavioral performance and amygdala activation were examined during an explicit emotion recognition task in female and male asian immigrants  and female and male caucasian europeans , allowing investigation of initial difficulties in emotion identification, their possible impact on amygdala response and analysis of potential gender-by-culture interactions regarding behavioral performance as well as neural activation patterns.

based on previous findings e.g.  <cit> , we hypothesized bilateral amygdala response in all subjects. however, according to findings on cultural differences in emotion processing behavior: e.g.  <cit> ; neural correlates: e.g.,  <cit> , we posited a significant impact of ethnic group on behavioral and neural responses that affects the amygdala: we hypothesized stronger amygdala activation in the female asian sample as they were out-group to the ethnic group of posers presented . considering previous results on the significant effect of duration of stay on emotion recognition performance  <cit>  and amygdala activation in male immigrants  <cit> , we also expected a significant association between duration of stay and behavioral performance and amygdala activation in asian females. moreover, we aimed at further exploring the impact of gender and culture on amygdala activation, as previous studies, mentioned above, reported inconsistencies or did not address this issue.

RESULTS
behavioral data
emotion recognition accuracy was  <dig> %  on average for asian and  <dig> %  for european subjects. the repeated measures anova revealed a significant emotion effect, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  with highest accuracy for fearful expressions and lowest performance for disgust, a significant ethnic group effect, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  with better performance of the europeans, a significant gender of poser effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  with higher scores for female posers, but no significant gender effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  ns. moreover, we observed a significant emotion-by-ethnic group interaction, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  a significant emotion-by-gender of poser interaction, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  and a significant emotion-by-gender of poser-by-ethnic group interaction, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  no further interaction reached significance .

disentangling the significant emotion-by-ethnic group interaction, we observed significant differences for anger  and disgust  that even remained significant after bonferroni correction, indicating lower performance of asians. post-hoc analysis of the significant emotion-by-gender of poser interaction revealed that angry and disgusted expressions were better recognized in male posers  while fear was more accurately recognized in female posers . for the other expressions no significant effect occurred . looking at the three-way interaction  we noticed several significant differences, however after bonferroni correction only those for female and male anger  as well as female and male disgust  remained significant indicating lower performance in the asian sample.

reaction times were  <dig>  s  on average for asians and  <dig>  s  for europeans. analysis of reaction times revealed a significant emotion effect, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η². = . <dig>  with fastest response times to happy expressions, no significant ethnic group effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  no significant gender of poser effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  and no significant gender effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  however, a significant emotion-by-gender of poser, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  and a significant emotion-by-gender of poser-by-ethnic group interaction, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  occurred. all other interactions were not significant .

correlation analysis revealed neither a significant association between recognition performance and duration of stay, r =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  nor between reaction time and duration of stay, r =  <dig> , p = . <dig> 

functional data
separate group analyses for asian and european subjects showed bilateral amygdala activation to all presented emotions and neutral expressions, and direct comparison between emotional vs. neutral expressions revealed significantly stronger amygdala response to emotional faces. besides amygdala activation, responses of bilateral fusiform gyrus, inferior occipital and frontal gyri, inferior and medial temporal regions, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus as well as brainstem and cerebellum emerged for all emotions and neutral expressions for asians and europeans, respectively . regarding direct comparisons , several differences occurred including the amygdala, although none of these survived an fdr corrected threshold.

roi analysis
the roi analysis including the contrast estimates emotion > neutral for female and male posers, demonstrated a significant main effect of ethnic group, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  with stronger activation in asians but no significant effect of gender, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  nor gender-by-ethnic group interaction, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  moreover, a significant gender of poser effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  and a significant gender of poser-by-ethnic group interaction, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  η² = . <dig>  emerged. no laterality effect, f =  <dig> , p = . <dig>  was observed and no further interaction was significant .

post-hoc analysis of the significant gender of poser-by-ethnic group interaction revealed a significant difference in amygdala activation for male posers , with higher values in the asian sample and a trend in the same direction for amygdala reactions to female posers . mean parameter estimates of asian females and males and european females and males for the contrast emotion-neutral female poser and male poser are illustrated in figure  <dig> 

correlations
since we observed no significant laterality effect and no significant interaction, we performed correlation analyses using the mean parameters of amygdala activation. no significant correlation emerged between recognition accuracy and mean response of the amygdala, neither for the whole sample , nor for asians  or europeans .

analyzing the impact of duration of stay on mean amygdala activation across all asian participants revealed a significant result, r = − <dig> , p = . <dig>  indicating stronger amygdala response in those asians with shorter duration of stay. gender-specific analyses demonstrated a significant negative association for both, asian females, r = − <dig> , p = . <dig>  and asian males, r = − <dig> , p = . <dig>  to explore whether these correlations significantly differ we applied a fisher’s z transformation, which revealed no significant difference . using multiple hierarchical regression analyses, we assessed whether gender acts as a mediator variable. while gender alone showed no significant effect on amygdala activation , duration of stay showed a significant impact , but the interaction of gender and duration of stay remained not significant .

explorative analysis of impact of gender of poser on these correlations revealed a significant association between duration of stay and amygdala activation to male posers, r = − <dig> , p =. <dig>  while no such correlation occurred for female posers, r = − <dig> , p = . <dig>  figure  <dig> illustrates the significant correlation between amygdala response and duration of stay in asian females and males.

discussion
this study investigated the behavioral performance and neural activation during an explicit emotion recognition task to examine the impact of exposure to emotional expressions of a different, previously unfamiliar ethnic group in asian female and male immigrants. in concordance with previous results from our lab on male immigrants  <cit>  and our hypothesis, bilateral amygdala activation in both samples was observed, confirming the role of the amygdala as a 'relevance detector'  <cit> . the amygdala seems to be fundamental in emotion processing as a part of the underlying neural network although gender, socialization and cultural background seem to exert a certain impact on its activation.

amygdala activation and the alien-effect
in general, asian females and males demonstrated significantly stronger neural response of the amygdala when asked to explicitly recognize the emotions presented by caucasian actors, which reflects recent findings observed in an asian male sample  <cit> . moreover, significantly stronger amygdala activation was apparent during processing of male faces in the asian sample, while only a trend emerged for female posers. hence, recognizing emotions in caucasian faces, and here particularly male faces, leads to stronger bilateral amygdala activation in asians than in caucasians who are viewing in-group faces. interestingly, this effect is not specific to the gender of the rater since both female and male asians responded similarly. this demonstrates that an alien-effect exists for female and male immigrants, a finding which extends our knowledge on ethnic group effects on  face processing e.g.,  <cit> . the stronger amygdala activation might be related to novelty but also motivation and emotional learning e.g.,  <cit>  as asian immigrants may want to assimilate with the host culture and thus emotional expressions of the foreign ethnic group exhibit a strong salient cue as shown previously  <cit> . moreover, in our study we only presented faces with direct gaze and previous experiments indicated that the amygdala is sensitive to gaze direction e.g.,  <cit> . richeson and colleagues  <cit>  even showed that race-related activity of the amygdala is modulated by eye-gaze. very recently, adams et al.  <cit>  reported stronger amygdala activation to direct vs. averted gaze fear expressed by out-group posers in caucasian american and japanese students, while for in-group expressions averted vs. direct gaze yielded stronger amygdala response. direct eye gaze has been shown to facilitate social categorization  <cit>  but also communicates a range of intentions, amongst these also hostility  <cit>  and has been shown to influence threat perceptions e.g.,  <cit> . hence, in our asian participants’ elevated amygdala activation particularly to out-group male expressions might also be influenced by gaze direction, prompting a stronger need of fast evaluation. additionally, several studies report greater attention to out-group faces apparent in larger amplitudes of the n <dig>  the p <dig> and the p <dig> e.g.,  <cit>  probably reflecting an automatic vigilance effect in which attention is quickly and relatively automatically directed to 1) stimuli with potentially negative implications for the self e.g.,  <cit> , 2) stimuli that are emotionally-valenced and thus are associated with greater arousal e.g.,  <cit>  and 3) stimuli that are novel and distinctive e.g.,  <cit> . therefore, it seems not surprising that the sole presentation of caucasian facial expressions of emotions elicited stronger amygdala activation in our asian participants  as compared to caucasian europeans. nevertheless, by analyzing the impact of gender of poser we extended current knowledge and future studies might want to further analyze whether this factor also affects studies on gaze perception.

we also observed a significant inverse correlation between duration of stay and amygdala activation during emotion processing in the asian group that was not mediated by gender of participant. this result further supports our previous finding from an exclusively male sample, reflecting possible adaptation and familiarity effects on the neural level and support the view that the amygdala plays an essential role in the neural network underlying the “alien-effect” and race processing in more general cf.  <cit> . as pointed out by kitayama and park  <cit> , experience is powerfully organized by culture and thus we assume that the observed association between duration of stay and amygdala activation reflects neural learning and acclimatization processes that can be measured within the first year and eventually might also improve recognition accuracy. however, no significant correlation emerged between behavioral performance and duration of stay, probably for two reasons: 1) adaptation effects manifest on the neural level before behavioral performance differences can be measured, and 2) the fact that there is no significant association of behavioral performance and duration of stay might be due to the restricted time of residency  in our inclusion criteria since this was a cross-sectional study. as pointed out by elfenbein and ambady  <cit> , a statistically significant improvement in performance was detectable after  <dig>  years spent in the foreign culture. longitudinal studies with several time points would be necessary to clarify after what time adaptation effects can be measured in which neural regions and when neural changes lead to detectable improvements in performance.

intracultural gender differences in amygdala activation
analysis of gender differences in amygdala activation between asian females and males as well as european females and males revealed no significant gender difference. this finding was corroborated by the result from the whole-brain analysis and is consistent with previous results from others e.g.,  <cit>  and recent findings from our own group  <cit>  addressing emotion recognition abilities in healthy subjects. considering asian gender differences, rarely have studies explicitly addressed this topic in healthy asian participants and observed no significant difference in amygdala activation  <cit> . moreover, several studies showed that gender differences in personality, values, and emotions are larger in “western” cultures. they are seen as a product of self-stereotyping, which occurs when between-gender social comparisons are made which are more likely, and exert a greater impact, in western nations e.g.,  <cit> . thus, we believe while gender effects in amygdala activation during emotion processing and more specifically during emotion recognition might occur in clinical samples e.g.,  <cit>  in healthy females and males, especially from asian origin, and using the described task, no such differences will arise cf.  <cit> . nevertheless, gender differences in amygdala activation during various emotional behavior e.g., humor processing:  <cit> ; empathy:  <cit>  have been observed indicating that “western” females more strongly rely on regions associated with emotion processing, i.e. amygdala, insula, posterior cingulate cortex, while males rather recruit cognition-related areas, i.e. temporo-parietal junction. here, fmri studies investigating the interaction of culture and gender on the neural and behavioral correlates are missing but are needed if our understanding is to be extended.

emotion recognition performance and the alien-effect
the “alien-effect” was also evident in the emotion recognition performance, as recognition accuracy differed significantly between groups: asian females and males had greater difficulties with caucasian expressions of anger and disgust, which was apparent in their behavioral performance during scanning.

anger is considered to be a very powerful and threatening emotion particularly when depicted by out-group targets cf.  <cit>  and some studies even suggest that powerful emotions are more intensely experienced and expressed by men, while women rather experience emotions associated with powerlessness, such as fear, sadness and shame e.g.,  <cit> . despite this gender issue, some cross-cultural studies also indicate that caucasian expressions of anger are less accurately recognized by asian participants than by caucasian subjects, in particular caucasian americans e.g.,  <cit> . interestingly, huang et al. also observed an inter-asian difference in anger recognition, with chinese subjects performing significantly better than japanese subjects when confronted with japanese and caucasian expressions of anger. huang and colleagues thus suggest that 1) asian raters do not judge negative emotions – irrespective of poser ethnicity – the same way that caucasians do, and 2) japanese raters obviously have a stronger tendency not to label negative emotional expressions as negative but tend to rather pick the neutral category. we investigated participants from china  and japan  but the small sample size prevented computing of any inter-asian analysis of performance. therefore, our results need to be replicated in a larger sample to allow comparison between asian subjects of different ethnicities. at the moment, our data support the assumption of huang et al.  <cit>  suggesting that particularly expressions of negative emotions, here anger, might be strongly influenced by so-called nonverbal dialects in expression style. additionally, behavioral performance and choice of response might also be influenced by cultural stereotypes, in particular by the cultural evaluation of negative emotions.

limitations
while this study provides new insight into cultural and gender effects on amygdala activation during emotion recognition, several methodological constraints have to be considered. since this was a cross-sectional study we cannot make any inferences on the further course of the adaptation process, in particular regarding emotion recognition performance. as pointed out above, we can only speculate that the initial difficulties apparent in the lower recognition accuracy may diminish after a certain time spent in the foreign culture and only longitudinal studies with several time points allow demonstration of neural and behavioral learning processes and the underlying transfer processes.

we were particularly interested in cultural effects on amygdala activation and thus relied on a specifically optimized protocol with restricted brain coverage. however, in light of the significant behavioral differences for anger and previous results on the neural circuits of race processing cf.  <cit> , whole brain coverage might be more favorable to detect differences in higher cortical areas  and enable analysis of effective connectivity of the amygdala within the emotional network. in the future this should be possible using phased-array head coils with improved sensitivity at higher magnetic fields cf.  <cit> .

moreover, presenting more stimuli per emotion would have allowed emotion specific analysis and thus might have enabled further understanding of recognition difficulties apparent in significantly reduced performance for angry expressions in asians. despite the lack of standardized and validated stimuli from asian subjects in our stimulus material, presentation of these stimuli would have enabled a thorough analysis of in-group and out-group effects. however, we were specifically interested in how faces of the major ethnic group immigrants with a different ethnic background are confronted with are processed on the neural and behavioral level. cross-cultural studies showing in-group and out-group faces to in-group and out-group raters are scarce, particularly in neuroimaging experiments e.g.,  <cit>  and most studies have shown stimuli of different ethnic targets to participants from only one ethnic group or mixed groups, not differentiating between several ethnic groups e.g.,  <cit> . moreover, future studies might want to investigate the impact of duration of stay on the neural substrates of the in-group and out-group effects in facial emotion recognition.

more generally, the selection of participants per sé is biased. we refer to asians but only measured a small group of chinese and japanese females and males. moreover, evidence has accumulated that genetic differences are inextricably intertwined with cultural differences  <cit> . however, in this study we concentrated on the effect of culture on amygdala activity; it was not our aim to highlight the causes of these cultural differences.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to investigate the impact of gender, gender of poser, and ethnic group on emotion recognition and its behavioral and neural correlates in asian and european females and males. we observed bilateral amygdala activation to emotional expressions in all groups. in the asian sample, a stronger response of the amygdala was observed bilaterally and paralleled by reduced performance, especially for angry and disgusted faces. roi analysis revealed no significant gender difference in amygdala activation, but a significant interaction of gender of poser and ethnic group, indicating stronger activation in the asian sample, particularly for male expressions. moreover, we observed a significant inverse correlation between duration of stay and amygdala activation indicating that exposure to a foreign ethnic group is a relevant factor for neuroimaging studies addressing emotion processing in female and male immigrants. particularly in times of globalization and increasing international exchange and interaction, understanding nonverbal communication styles e.g. by accurately recognizing emotional expressions, is critical for successful societal integration and interaction between members of different ethnic groups and this competency underlies adaptation effects. these adaptation effects however might not be limited to emotional competencies, thus the impact of duration of stay might also occur for cognitive functions which needs to be elucidated in studies to come. notably, in our study, culture and gender of poser significantly modulated emotion recognition accuracy and amygdala activation, indicating that not only between-group differences but also within-group differences, particularly regarding the impact of stimulus material on neural activation, should be considered.

taken together, this study demonstrates the first attempt to analyze the impact of gender and culture on amygdala activation during emotion recognition. while we observed no gender difference, culture and gender of poser asserted significant effects on the behavioral and neural correlates of this emotional capacity, thereby extending our knowledge on the bases of emotion recognition differences between participants with divergent cultural backgrounds.
