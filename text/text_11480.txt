BACKGROUND
spliceosome assembly in yeast occurs in a stepwise manner with u <dig>  u <dig>  u4/u <dig> and u <dig> snrnps binding sequentially to the pre-mrna and each other. the first defined step is the building of the commitment complex in yeast or the e complex in metazoans where the u1snrnp binds initially to the 5' splice site. the metazoan u1snrnp contains the proteins u1-a, u1-70k and u1-c. the yeast u1snrnp contains the homologs of these proteins, mud <dig>  snp <dig> and yhc <dig>  as well as seven additional proteins  <cit> .

in yeast the essential u1snrnp component prp <dig> plays an important role in bringing the 5' and 3' splice sites into spatial proximity so that the intron can be spliced out of the pre-mrna  <cit> . ito et al <cit>  found prp <dig> to interact with snu <dig> among their "core" yeast two-hybrid  data. to our knowledge, no direct interaction between prp <dig> and luc <dig> has been reported although both proteins have been found in the same complex multiple times .

prp <dig> is a modular protein consisting of a pair of ww domains followed by a series of four ff domains . ff domains were first described in  <dig> by bedford & leder as domains of about  <dig> amino acids including two conserved phenylalanines  after which the domain was named  <cit> . typically ff domains occur in tandem arrays. for example, among the  <dig> metazoan ff domain proteins listed in the smart database  <cit> ,  <dig> have  <dig> or  <dig> ff domains, while all others have  <dig> to  <dig>  the structure of three ff domains has been solved recently: the ff <dig> domain of the human protein hypa/fbp <dig>  the ff <dig> domain of the yeast protein prp <dig>  and the single ff domain of urn1/ypr152c  <cit> . ff domain proteins can be classified in two families: the p <dig> rho gtpase-related proteins  <cit>  and the ww/ff family whose members contain one or more ww domains followed by several ff domains. three proteins of the latter family are known to recognize the phosphorylated c-terminal domain  of the rna polymerase ii via their ff domains, namely the human transcription elongation factor ca <dig>  the human splicing factor fbp <dig> and the yeast splicing factor prp <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, ff domains of ca <dig> seem to use multiple independent binding sites rather than to bind cooperatively to proteins such as the transcription and splicing associated factor tat-sf <dig>  <cit> . the ff <dig> domain of prp <dig> is known to interact with clf <dig> , an essential and well conserved multifunctional protein  <cit> . the role of the second yeast ff protein, urn1/ypr152c, which contains one ww domain and one ff domain, may be a splicing factor too  <cit> .

here we investigated the role of the ff domains and their binding specificity. more specifically, our study aims to complement other data in order to define a consensus binding site for ff domains, such as those sites known for other domains such as the sh <dig> domain . we addressed this problem by a combination of genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screens, in-vitro binding assays, peptide arrays, and genetic experiments.

we show that only two of the four ff domains of prp <dig> are essential and explain this behaviour by their interactions with two other components of the yeast u <dig> snrnp. the binding site we found significantly differs from previously published binding sites of ff domains and thus implicates that ff domains are interaction modules with a wide range of specificities, in stark contrast to other domains such as sh <dig> or pdz domains.

RESULTS
prp <dig> interacts with luc <dig> and snu <dig> via its ff domains
to investigate the interaction properties of yeast ff domains, we first screened prp <dig> and urn1/ypr152c as well as several isolated ff domain baits against genome wide yeast two-hybrid arrays containing almost all orfs of saccharomyces cerevisiae as gal4-activation domain fusions . these screens resulted in only two interaction partners, snu <dig> and luc <dig>  two other known components of the u <dig> snrnp  <cit> . no interaction partners could be identified for the full-length ypr152c protein, nor for its ff domain bait.

once prp <dig> was identified as interacting bait, we cloned its ff domains and combinations thereof and tested these as baits against fragments of snu <dig> and luc <dig> as preys . these experiments showed that the ff <dig> domain of prp <dig> binds to a c-terminal fragment of luc <dig> . similarly, a c-terminal fragment of snu <dig>  binds to prp <dig> ff domains 1– <dig>  interestingly, full length snu <dig> but not snu71-i interacts with the ff2- <dig> domain fragment .

we have also screened isolated domains or combinations thereof as baits against our genome-wide prey array. however, no new proteins were found this way: ff1- <dig> interacted with snu <dig> and luc <dig>  while ff1- <dig> and ff2- <dig> interacted only with snu <dig> but not luc <dig> in these screens .

these results encouraged us to revisit the protein topology of the u <dig> snrnp. we tested all u1snrnp associated proteins by systematic pairwise yeast two-hybrid tests using full-length bait and prey constructs but found only the previously detected interactions prp40-snu <dig> and prp40-luc <dig> 

to verify the yeast two-hybrid experiments by an independent method we performed gst pulldowns. different ff domains were expressed as gst fusion proteins in e. coli and purified on glutathione sepharose beads. surprisingly, protein constructs containing the ff <dig> domain consistently failed to be expressed in significant amounts. we conclude that the ff <dig> domain renders the ff <dig>  ff2- <dig>  ff1- <dig> and ff1- <dig> constructs somehow insoluble or unstable. nevertheless, snu <dig> and luc <dig> were translated and 35s-labeled in vitro and incubated with the remaining gst-ff fusion proteins. these experiments clearly showed that luc <dig> binds specifically to the ff <dig> and possibly ff <dig> domains of prp <dig> although binding to ff <dig> was signficantly weaker than to ff <dig> . unfortunately, the interaction between prp40-ff1- <dig> and snu <dig> could not be confirmed this way as it involved the inaccessible ff <dig> domain.

ff domains bind to specific peptides in luc <dig> and snu71
the two-hybrid mapping experiments did not provide any information about the precise binding sites of the prp <dig> ff domains within luc <dig> and snu <dig>  in order to map the binding sites of the prp <dig> ff domains we synthesized overlapping 15-mer peptides of luc <dig> and snu <dig> on nitrocellulose membranes and probed them with gst-ff domain fusions . the peptides used covered the regions of luc <dig>  and snu <dig>  that were shown to interact in y2h assays . these screens identified a peptide in the c-terminal half of luc <dig>  d214rrladhflgkihlg <dig> , that appeared to be the primary interactor of the ff <dig> domain . although the results shown in figures 3a–b used a fusion of ff1- <dig> an explicit goal of this project was to identify targets of single ff domains. hence the following experiments  were carried out with ff <dig> as this domain appeared to contribute most to binding . the a <dig> peptide was characterized by systematic alanine scans  and substitution analysis  to define critical amino acids for the interaction with the ff <dig> domain of prp <dig>  this analysis clearly showed the importance of the flgkih motif for binding – only glycine- <dig> and histidine- <dig> seemed less important for binding. based on our substitution analysis this interacting motif can be generalized as ϕ ×  ×  where ϕ may be any hydophobic amino acid . interestingly, the luc <dig> binding site showed no similarity to the interaction region  in snu <dig> which was obtained by the same approach . a consistent interaction region  narrowed down by four overlapping peptides was detected when snu <dig> ii was synthesised on a cape-membrane as 20-mer overlapping peptides with  <dig> amino acid shifts and probed with gst-ff1- <dig> 

only ff <dig> and ff <dig> domains are essential in yeast prp40
although the two-hybrid mapping experiments indicated that the first two ff domains of prp <dig> are the most important ones, their physiological role remained unclear. to determine the physiological role of the four ff domains in prp <dig> we deleted one or more ff domains starting from the c-terminus in vivo . in each mutant strain the deleted ff domain was replaced by a proteina/kanmx <dig> cassette for selection of deletion mutants and easy protein detection . we were unable to isolate a deletion of ff domain  <dig> and thus assumed it to be essential. however, the deletion of ff domains 3– <dig>  was viable albeit it showed a clear growth defect when compared to two control constructs  . deletions of ff domains 2– <dig> and 1– <dig> appear to be lethal too as we could not isolate such mutants. these results confirmed our initial two-hybrid findings which indicated that ff <dig> and ff <dig> are critical for prp <dig> whereas ff <dig> and ff <dig> may only increase its activity and/or stability.

ffΔ3– <dig> deletions do not inhibit splicing of dbp <dig> and ecm33
because prp <dig> is a well-established component of the u <dig> snrnp, we reasoned that its phenotype is probably due to a defect in splicing. to investigate this question, we tested splicing efficiency in two selected saccharomyces cerevisiae intron-containing genes, dbp <dig> and ecm <dig>  which are commonly used as splicing reporters. however, rt-pcr assays of the rnas of these two genes revealed no splicing defect in the ffΔ3– <dig> mutant .

discussion
although the composition of the the yeast u <dig> snrnp has been known for a decade  <cit>  the precise interactions among its components and their atomic structure remain elusive. equally puzzling is the fact that the human u <dig> snrnp is commonly assumed to consist of  <dig> proteins   <cit>  while its yeast counterpart contains up to  <dig> proteins  <cit> . in both species u1-a, u1-70k and u1-c  form a complex that is associated with the heptameric sm protein ring complex  <cit> . except for the mud1-snp1-yhc <dig> core complex and the lsm ring little information is available about the structure of the yeast u <dig> snrnp. most complex purification studies find large complexes of  <dig> to  <dig> proteins when individual u <dig> components are used as baits  <cit> . here we suggest that prp <dig>  luc <dig>  and snu <dig> form a subcomplex within the u <dig> snrnp. surprisingly, we did not find any other interaction within the u1snrnp when we systematically tested all pairwise interactions among the known  <dig> subunits, suggesting that limitations of the yeast two-hybrid system or the requirement for rna prevented detection of other interactions. many of the u1snrnp associated proteins contain rna binding domains and are known to bind rna directly  <cit> . interestingly, we did not find another known prp <dig> interactor, clf <dig>  <cit> , in our initial genome-wide yeast two-hybrid screen. however, subsequent verification of the pertinent array position revealed that the clf <dig> orf was missing from our prey array.

we showed that the ff <dig> domain of prp <dig> is responsible for the binding of luc <dig> whereas the region ff1- <dig> binds to full length snu <dig> as well as the c-terminal fragment snu71-i. the fragment containing ff2- <dig> binds to full-length snu <dig> but not to snu71-i. this suggests that binding may be cooperative or that regions outside snu71-i present additional binding sites. however, the single binding site indicates that there is no other strong site besides the n421dvhy motif. in any case, our results confirm that different ff domains clearly have different binding specificities with the ff1- <dig> region being the business end of prp <dig>  <cit> .

the ability of ff domains to bind non-phosphorylated peptides refutes the suggestion that the ff domain is an exclusively phospho-peptide binding domain.

the two ff domain binding sites identified by our study in luc  <dig> and snu <dig> do not share any obvious similarity with previously identified binding motifs . several studies showed that ff domains bind to phospho-peptides, usually the phospho-ctd of rna polymerase ii . similarly, several ff domains of ca <dig> were shown to bind to acidic peptides. however, while this may be true for prp <dig> ff domains 2– <dig> the ff <dig> domain of this protein appears to prefer basic residues. this finding is in agreement with the acidic nature of prp40-ff <dig>  and the basic ff <dig> and ff <dig> domains which bind the rather acidic snu <dig> peptide. unfortunately there is still too little information to derive reliable consensus binding sites. similarly, available 3d structures of ff domains bound with their cognant ligands are not sufficient to derive rules that allow us to predict binding sites more generally. clearly, more structural work is required to understand the binding mode of ff domains.

* i.e., two of the five residues either preceding or following an aromatic residue are negatively charged glutamic acid or asparagine.

** each of the ff <dig>  ff <dig>  and ff <dig> bound with similar affinity.

*** this interaction required both ww and ff domains. neither of them was able to bind to the ctd by itself .

murphy et al.  <cit>  have investigated the functional role of several motifs in prp <dig>  including putative rna-binding domains they call "region 1" and "region 2" both of which overlap with the first two ff domains . while deletion of region  <dig> is lethal, deletion of region  <dig> resulted in a slow growth phenotype. however, murphy et al. were not able to show rna-binding of these "domains" and thus it is likely that their similarity to rna-binding domains is spurious. the fact that they overlap significantly with the ff domains supports that notion. nevertheless, deletion of region  <dig> partially deletes the ff <dig> domain. it is possible that such a truncated ff <dig> domains has some residual binding activity and thus shows only a "slow growth" defect. we have not tested whether this partial deletion of ff <dig> still binds to snu <dig> but given the non-essential role of snu <dig>  binding may not be absolutely required for u <dig> function.

the role of snu <dig> remains elusive too. newo et al.  <cit>  have analyzed the u <dig> snrnp of schizosaccharomyces pombe and found no homolog of snu <dig> although homologs of prp <dig> and luc <dig> were clearly present. however, they speculate that usp107p may be a functional homolog of snu <dig>  given its similar size and the presence of a pwi domain in usp107p.

while prp <dig> does not bind to a conserved sequence in snu <dig>  the binding site in luc <dig> is highly conserved. as a more rigorous confirmation of the specificity of the prp <dig> and other ff domains, it would be interesting to compare the peptide-binding specificities of all available domains with their cognate peptides under comparable conditions. similarly, the in vivo relevance of the interactions described here can only be elucidated with detailed structural analysis and mutation of the interaction epitopes in vivo.

for a detailed understanding of u <dig> protein function, crystal structures of the individual proteins or, preferably, the whole complex, will be required. the structure would also tell us whether the ff domains of prp <dig> bind to 3-dimensional epitopes or two linear motifs. since membrane-bound peptides as used in this study may not be folded as in the native protein, they may produce artifactual results.

this study should also provide new insight into the important role of prp <dig> as a mediator between transcription and splicing. while prp <dig> has been consistently shown to be a component of the u <dig> snrnp, its precise role in splicing remains unclear. similarly, the mechanistic details of its involvement in transcription require additional data. several publications indicate a direct connection between specific steps of transcription and mrna-processing in eukaryotes, i. e. co-transcriptional mrna-processing  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that ff domains  <dig> and  <dig> are critical for prp <dig> function. however, while ff domains  <dig> and  <dig> are dispensable, they convey a considerable growth disadvantage when absent. we conclude that they also assist with spliceosome assembly or activity. this is also reflected by the evolutionary conservation of  <dig> or, sometimes  <dig>  ff domains in homologous proteins. we suggest that our observations may also help to characterize the u <dig> snrnp structurally and suggest that previous crystallization efforts failed because luc <dig> and snu <dig> were expressed individually and crystallization attempts included only such individual proteins. we speculate that luc <dig> may be crystallized together with prp <dig> or fragments thereof. further studies are required to derive general rules for physiological ff domain functions and activities.
