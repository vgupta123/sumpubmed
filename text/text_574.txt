BACKGROUND
neurotoxic chemicals, such as lead  and organophosphorus  insecticides are prevalent in the environment. the use of different in vitro cell culture assays for predicting the in vivo effects of these chemicals have been extensively reviewed in recent years and the issues pertaining to their use have also been discussed  <cit> . the in vitro systems have been developed and utilized not only to understand the mechanisms of toxicity at the molecular and cellular levels but also to screen potential neurotoxicants. potentially toxic compounds would be candidates for in vivo testing. the objective of neurotoxicologic studies on cells and tissues in vitro is to characterize the cellular and molecular substrates and pathways that contribute to impaired behavior, altered function, or pathological changes in the whole animal following exposure to a toxicant  <cit> . the two main types of cell culture systems used for in vitro neurological testing are  primary neuronal cell cultures dissociated from peripheral or central nervous system tissues and  clonal cell lines derived from tumors of neurological origin  <cit> .

primary neuronal cultures retain morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiological properties of neurons in situ <cit> . however, long-term culturing of primary neurons has been a major challenge. this creates difficulties in addressing the fundamental questions concerning cellular and molecular interactions among the many functionally distinct neuronal cell types that contribute to the development and functioning of the mammalian central nervous system  <cit> . neuroblastoma cell lines have been used extensively as in vitro models for studies on neuronal development, neurological diseases and disorders as well as mechanisms of actions and neurotoxicity of compounds affecting the nervous system  <cit> . these in vitro models can provide a well-controlled system in which to study many of the critical cellular processes of neuronal development including proliferation, differentiation, growth, and synaptogenesis. furthermore, cultured cell lines allow subtle changes in cell number, morphology, and functions to be readily detected compared to in vivo approaches and provide reproducibility in test results as well as providing a reduction in time, cost, and animal use  <cit> .

neuroblastoma cells can be differentiated by treatment with chemical agents into distinct morphologic cell types. these differentiated cells may be of different types:  substrate-adherent , which resemble non-neuronal precursor cells;  a sympathoadrenal neuroblastic ; or  intermediate , which share elements of both s and n types  <cit> . each of these cell types differs in their ability to induce a tumor. n-type cells are malignant, where as the s-type cells are not; however, the i-type cells show the greatest malignancy  <cit> . one common neuroblastoma cell type used for in vitro research is be-m <dig>  commonly known and henceforth called m <dig>  which is available from atcc.

m <dig> is a human neuroblastoma cell line cloned from the sk-n-be neuroblastoma cell line isolated from a  <dig> year old male . m <dig> cells are multipotential with regard to neuronal enzyme expression e.g., choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase and dopamine-β-hydroxylase implying cholinergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic properties. m <dig> cells convert glutamate to gaba  <cit> , however, this property is much less than that exhibited by cerebellar cortex which contains gabaergic neurons  <cit> . there has been a great deal of research into differentiating the m <dig> cell line by treatment with trans-retinoic acid ; this treatment transformed the m <dig> cells to a morphologically distinct phenotype, i.e., neuroblastic with neuritic processes and with neurochemical characteristics  <cit> . this treatment was the forerunner to the current clinical therapy of neuroblastomas using isotretinoin. however, little research has been performed on the functional changes in m <dig> cells after exposure to ra.

in the present study, we differentiated m <dig> cells by treatment of cultures with  <dig> μm ra over a time period of  <dig> hours and investigated the morphological, neurochemical and functional changes that occurred. we observed the formation of neuronal processes and expression of proteins , synaptic vesicle associated protein –  <dig> kda , neurofilamentin heavy chain  and medium chain , synapsin, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha  <dig> ; moreover, we measured two functional parameters i.e., voltage-gated ca2+ channel activity and stimulus-induced ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter  release. in our and other laboratories, ca2+-dependent  glycine release inhibition due neurotoxins  has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of toxicity in neuronal models such as cultured primary mouse spinal cord cells  <cit>  and synaptosomes prepared from rat brain and spinal cord  <cit> . we have also looked at the effects of ra differentiation on m <dig> cells toxicity studies of the known toxicant, phosgene . cg is a highly toxic chemical used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, dyes, and polyfoam rubber products. cg causes bronchoconstriction, vasoconstriction and associated pathological effects that could be life threatening and is reported to have a neural component involved in its toxicity  <cit> .

methods
cell culture
frozen stock of the human neuroblastoma cell line, m <dig> , was cultured in  <dig> or  <dig> cm <dig> tissue culture flasks in a 1: <dig> mixture of eagle’s minimum essential medium with non-essential amino acids and f <dig> medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum inside a humidified cell culture incubator with 95% air plus 5% carbon dioxide according to company instructions to initiate the cultures. at 70-80% confluency, the monolayer cells were sub-cultured in appropriate vessels for use in experiments. when the cultures reached about 30% confluency, these cells were differentiated by treatment with  <dig> μm retinoic acid  added to the culture medium for  <dig> –  <dig> days or until they reached the desired confluency.

light microscopy
cells were grown on coverslips to approximately 80% confluency. cell media was decanted and the cells washed in  <dig>  m sodium cacodylate buffer. the cells were then fixed in buffered  <dig> % formaldehyde and  <dig> % glutaraldehyde for 2– <dig> minutes at room temperature. the fixed cells were rinsed in  <dig>  m sodium cacodylate buffer and stained with methylene blue in sodium borate solution for 1– <dig> minutes. the stained cells were rinsed with double distilled millipore water. the cover slips were then inverted on a 1x <dig> positively charged slide. the cells were viewed and photographed at a magnification of 400x with an olympus bx <dig> microscope with nikon photo assembly digital site ds-l <dig> 

immunofluorescent staining
m <dig> cells were seeded onto  <dig> mm coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine . at described times, cells were fixed for  <dig> min in  <dig> % formaldehyde, permeabilized with  <dig> % saponin in pbs and blocked with 3% bsa . primary antibodies against the neuron-specific proteins β3-tubulin and synapsin-1/ <dig>  were diluted 1: <dig> in pbss and applied for  <dig> h at room temperature, followed by alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies  diluted 1: <dig> in pbss. coverslips were mounted onto slides with prolong gold dapi  and imaged using a zeiss lsm  <dig> confocal microscope. z-stack images were converted to a maximum projection image using zen  <dig>  software.

sds-page and western blotting to assess levels of neuronal proteins
the level of neuronal proteins and snap- <dig> in m <dig> cells was assessed by sds-page and western blotting following the method described by ray et al.  <cit> . briefly, cells harvested in ice-cold physiological saline were lysed by incubating with a lysis buffer containing  <dig> mm tris–hcl,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm edta,  <dig> mg/ml bsa,  <dig> mm pmsf, 1% triton x- <dig> and protease inhibitors present in a protease inhibitor cocktail  which was included throughout the wash and solubilization steps to prevent protein degradation during the assay. the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at  <dig>  x g for  <dig> min and immediately analyzed by sds-page. each gel  lane was loaded with approximately  <dig> μg protein, which was determined by bicinchoninic acid  protein assay. dry transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride  membranes was performed using the iblot™ system  and blocked in 2%  bovine serum albumin for  <dig> hr . to determine the protein levels of specific neuronal proteins, blots were probed with primary antibodies overnight at 4°c. the primary antibodies include neuron specific enolase , snap- <dig> , and vimentin , all purchased from sigma ; m <dig> muscarinic acetylcholine receptor , choline acetyltransferase  from cell signaling ; synapsin , neurofilament medium , and neurofilament heavy  from millipore ; and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α <dig> . antibodies to β-actin  or gapdh , both from cell signaling , were used for normalization to confirm equivalent gel loading. this was followed by one hour incubation with a 1: <dig> dilution of polyclonal peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse igg followed by diaminobenzidine hydrogen peroxide  and a 1: <dig> dilution of appropriate peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit igg. detection was performed by fluorescent detection of enhanced chemifluorescent  substrate  on the typhoon+ . the relative amount of protein was quantified by densitometric analysis using image j program  and normalized against the respective house- keeping protein  for each parameter studied. to ensure equal loading of proteins on the gel, each marker protein was normalized against a house-keeping protein . the house-keeping protein needed to be separate from the marker protein on the gel. differences in marker proteins in differentiated vs. undifferentiated cells were assessed in terms of % normalized optical density in differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated  controls as shown in the table. normalized optical density of undifferentiated control was 100% for each type of marker protein.

neurotransmitter release
high potassium-stimulated ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release was determined as previously described  <cit> . cultures were incubated with  <dig> μci/ml  glycine for  <dig> min at 37°c to label a releasable  glycine pool. cells were then washed with a series of low k+ -containing isotonic buffers . unless otherwise indicated,  glycine release was stimulated by addition of  <dig> mm k+ and  <dig> mm ca2+ to cultures; stimulation medium was collected after  <dig> min at 37°c. calcium-dependent release was determined by subtracting baseline radioactivity secreted from cultures in the absence of ca2+, and expressed as a percentage of the total cellular radioactivity.

radiolabeled 45ca2+ uptake due to kcl depolarization
m <dig> cells were seeded into  <dig> well plates  and cultured with  <dig> μci/ml of -valine  for  <dig> hours. the medium was then aspirated and cells were washed two times with  <dig> ml of a physiological balanced solution  containing in mm:  <dig> nacl,  <dig>  kcl,  <dig>  cacl <dig>   <dig>  mgcl <dig>   <dig> hepes,  <dig>  glucose. all components for this solution were obtained from sigma-aldrich . cells were then incubated with an additional  <dig> ml aliquot of pbs for one hour for equilibration. the pbs was replaced with either pbs or stimulation medium containing  <dig> –  <dig> mm kcl and  <dig> μci/ml 45cacl <dig>  the different kcl concentrations were adjusted by reducing the nacl concentration proportionately to maintain iso osmolality. the addition of  <dig> μci/ml of 45cacl <dig> did not significantly alter the osmolality or the concentration of cacl <dig> . after  <dig> minutes, the radioactive medium was aspirated and ice-cold pbs was used to wash cells twice. the cells were then lyzed by adding  <dig>  n naoh solution and rocked overnight at 4°c. the next day, the  <dig> n naoh solution was ph neutralized with  <dig> n hcl + tris. the neutralized solution was added to scintillation fluid and 45ca and 3h levels were measured on a beckman ls <dig> multi-purpose scintillation counter . calcium-dependent release was determined by subtracting baseline radioactivity secreted from cultures in the absence of ca2+, and expressed as a percentage of the total cellular radioactivity. total cellular radioactivity was calculated by adding the 45ca2+ cpm released upon stimulation with high kcl and the 45ca2+ cpm present in the resting medium with low kcl before and after stimulation.

direct ca2+ uptake assay 
the ca2+ uptake assay kit  contains a fluo- <dig> analog that produces a large fluorescence intensity increase in response to ca2+ binding with fluorescence excitation at  <dig> nm and emission at  <dig> nm. the fluo-4™ direct ca2+ assay kit was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. briefly, 2x fluo- <dig> direct ca2+ assay buffer  was thawed and mixed with  <dig> mm probenecid. the assay was conducted in monolayer cultures. the 2x fluo- <dig> direct ca2+ assay buffer with  <dig> mm probenecid was added in equal volume to the sample volume and incubated at 37°c for approximately one hour . the fluorescence  was measured using the spectramax gemini em  using excitation and emission wavelengths mentioned above.

phosgene  exposure
cultex air/liquid exposure system for either  <dig> mm or  <dig> mm culture filters was purchased from vetrocell . prior to exposure to cg, the cells grown on these filters were transferred into the exposure device. cells were nourished by culture growth medium below the filter membrane and exposed directly to either air  or air/cg  without growth medium on top of the cells. the vapor exposure system was moved to a chemical agent exposure hood and exposed to cg by connecting to the inlet of the cultex system that ends on a hyperboloid-shaped air distribution  ensuring uniform exposure of the aerosol on the surface of the cell culture  <cit> . the outlet of the exposure system was passed through a decontamination solution. after exposure to air or cg, the cells were fed with fresh medium from the upper side and free intracellular ca2+ was monitored by the fluo- <dig> direct assay described above.

to assess intracellular free ca2+ changes due to cg exposure, undifferentiated or differentiated m <dig> cells were first loaded with fluo- <dig> and an initial fluorescence reading was taken to record the basal ca2+ level . the cells were then exposed to either  <dig> ppm  or  <dig> ppm of cg  for  <dig> min at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/well/min. the free intracellular ca2+ changes were monitored directly following exposure as a function of time.

treatment with ca2+ ionophore a23187
the ca2+ ionophore a <dig>  was prepared at stock concentration in dmso according to manufacturer’s instructions. further dilutions were prepared in m <dig> medium. a <dig> was added directly to m <dig> cells cultured in transwell inserts to obtained final concentration of  <dig> μm. to assess intracellular free ca2+, the cells were first loaded with fluo- <dig> prior to addition of a <dig> and the change in intracellular ca2+ concentration was measured directly following addition of a <dig> using fluo- <dig> direct assay.

RESULTS
morphological changes and possible synaptic activity
to establish the conditions for ra treatment to induce cellular differentiation, we examined the effects of different ra concentrations  and times . m <dig> cells transformed from an immature to a more mature neuronal state after  <dig> hours of exposure to  <dig> μm ra. light photomicrographs of cells grown with or without  <dig> μm ra are shown in figure  <dig>  undifferentiated cells had a more rounded morphology with few neurites or apparent synapses. upon exposure to ra, the cells changed to a neuron-like triangular shape. some of these cells were multinucleated with extended neurites. treatment using less than either  <dig> μm ra or  <dig> hrs did not produce the morphological differentiation as shown as figure  <dig> . moreover, functional indicators of neuronal differentiation as evidenced by immunofluorescence staining of synaptic marker proteins or stimulated neurotransmitter  release described below were either not prominent  or inconsistent  . the treatment conditions that we selected were previously used to show early effects of ra-induced neuronal differentiation and oncogene  expression in another be variant cell clone  <cit> .

to evaluate morphologic evidence of synaptogenesis, we used immunofluorescence staining to compare expression and localization of the pre-synaptic marker synapsin-1/ <dig> and the early-stage neuron-specific marker β3-tubulin in undifferentiated versus differentiated m <dig> cells. as was observed using light microscopy , undifferentiated m <dig> cells were characterized by a rounded morphology, with few processes, and synapsin-1/ <dig> and β3-tubulin were distributed throughout the cell body . by  <dig> h after ra treatment  some m <dig> cells had developed a radial glial-like morphology with bilateral processes, although compartmentalization of synapsin-1/ <dig> and β3-tubulin was not observed . by  <dig> h differentiated m <dig> cells exhibited extended processes with neuritic morphologies . synapsin-1/ <dig> and β3-tubulin were observed to be diffusely present within the cell body , but also exhibited punctate localization along neurites . β3-tubulin and synapsin-1/ <dig> also exhibited distinct expression patterns within the neurite growth cone, such that β3-tubulin was concentrated along the neurite extension whereas synapsin-1/ <dig> accumulated within the growth cone tip .

expression of neuron specific proteins
the levels of expression of selected neuron specific proteins were studied to help establish the degree of maturation of m <dig> cells with and without  <dig> μm ra treatment. cultures of untreated and ra treated cells were harvested and cell lysates were used for western blot analyses. the same lysates were used to detect nse, snap- <dig>  synapsin, neurofilaments m and h, nachr, machr, and chat. the immunoreactictivity of selected neuronal proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  each specific protein was identified by a single band marked at the appropriate molecular weight. band intensities were quanitatively estimated and the results are shown as the of % normalized optical density in differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated  controls . the levels of snap- <dig> , synapsin , and neurofilament m  showed an increase in differentiated vs. undifferentiated cells. however, no neurofilament-light  was detected . the level of nachr α <dig>  remained the same upon differentiation with ra. vimentin was expressed in undifferentiated cells but decreased upon differentiation . neither undifferentiated nor differentiated cells expressed any detectable amount of chat  and m <dig> machr . the specific antibodies used to detect chat and m <dig> machr as described above under methods positively identifies these proteins in rat brain tissue .

neurotransmitter release
the effect of differentiation on functional neuroexocytosis was assessed in m <dig> cells by measuring potassium stimulated  glycine release. undifferentiated m <dig> cells had a basal level of stimulated glycine release; this was significantly increased in differentiated cells . this increase in neurotransmitter release correlates with the increase in the neuronal markers, particularly the vesicular fusion protein, snap- <dig> 

expression of functional voltage-gated ca 2+ channels
it is interesting to note that in m <dig> cells the increase in 45ca2+ uptake due to increasing concentrations of kcl in the incubation medium was very pronounced  in differentiated cells ; however, undifferentiated cells had a small increase . to characterize the type of ca2+ channels involved, 45ca2+ uptake was measured in the absence and presence of known channel subtype specific antagonists. the antagonists were as follows: nnc 55– <dig> ; conotoxin gvia ; and agatoxin iva . the concentrations of the antagonists used where according to published reports  <cit> . the results  showed a small reduction in stimulated 45ca2+ uptake due to nnc 55– <dig> , whereas a 50-60% reduction was observed due to conotoxin  or agatoxin . these observations suggested functional cav <dig>  and  <dig>  channels in differentiated cells.

differentiated m <dig> cells as a model to study neurotoxicity
we hypothesized that the lack of expression of voltage-gated ca2+ channels in undifferentiated m <dig> cells limits their use as neurotoxicity model. to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of a toxic industrial chemical, cg on intracellular free ca2+ concentration  in both undifferentiated and ra differentiated m <dig> cells. first, we tested the effect of the non-specific ca2+ ionophore a <dig>  on i. the results shown in figure 8a demonstrated a large increase in i due to a <dig> as expect without any significant difference between undifferentiated vs. differentiated cells. cg  caused significant decreases  at all times tested only in the ra differentiated cells without any effect in undifferentiated cells .

discussion
neuronal cell models have been tested for their use in predicting in vivo effects of different neurotoxic substances  <cit> . attempts have been made to develop and to utilize these in vitro neuronal models to study the mechanisms of toxicity due to chemical and biological compounds at cellular and molecular levels. moreover, these models have also been tested for their use in rapid screening of potential neurotoxicants out of which positive compounds would be selected for in vivo evaluation. prior studies using in vitro cellular models were intended to generate preliminary mechanistic and toxicity information while reducing animal use and associated high cost of in vivo testing. the following are the three different types of in vitro cellular models primarily used in biomedical research;  primary cell cultures,  clonal cell lines, and  neural stem cells. the main advantage of using primary cell cultures is that they retain the morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiological properties of neurons in situ <cit> . however, the disadvantages of primary cell cultures include  a limited life span,  increased genetic variability between model systems and cultures,  mixture of different neuronal populations in each preparation, as well as  high resource requirements  <cit> . neural stem cells have the ability for self renewal and generating multiple cell types representing different parts of the nervous system; moreover, they can be derived from humans. however, as with primary cultures, the stem cells require animal use resulting in high resource requirements and regulatory issues. after neural stem cells have reached the end of their short variable life span, a new line has to be generated and then characterized before use  <cit> ; this is neither time nor cost effective.

a clonal cell line is defined as a population of cells that originated from a single source and can be maintained in culture for an extended period of time. a clonal cell culture has a number of advantages that make them useful as in vitro models: easy to obtain; relatively easy to grow; divide rapidly; and can be continuously subcultured for a relatively high number of passages to provide a large number of cells in a short period of time  <cit> . the clonal m <dig> neuroblastoma cell line used in this study has the characteristics described above as well as the ability to become differentiated into a neuroblastic  cell when cultured in the presence of ra for several days  <cit> . these properties make the m <dig> cell line a good in vitro cell model for mechanistic and neurotoxicity testing. however, the functional changes in m <dig> cells due to ra differentiation have not been thoroughly characterized. a very relevant question is why do we need a differentiated neuronal model for neurobiology studies. the answer is that most of the neuronal functions such as membrane excitability, ion channels, neurotransmitter release, endocyctotic and exocyctotic events etc. are characteristics of mature neurons and cannot be studied in an immature neuronal model.

treatment with ra results in the progressive development of neuronal morphologies and formation of neuronal networks seen in a more mature neuronal culture over time. a commonly measured characteristic of differentiation is extension of neurites that are akin to the axons and dendrites of fully differentiated neurons  <cit> . these neuronal properties in ra differentiated m <dig> cells were evidenced by both light microscopic observations  and immunofluorescence staining . although differentiated m <dig> cells demonstrated evidence of maturing neuronal organization and properties, the functional verification of synaptic activity remains to be done.

besides morphological characteristics, we also observed differences in expression of several neuron specific proteins between undifferentiated and differentiated m <dig> cells . the presence or levels of certain proteins can vary between immature and mature neurons. one such protein is neuron specific enolase  which is responsible for generating phosphopyruvate hydratase that participates in glycolosis/gluconeogenesis; the levels of nse increase as the neurons mature. while undifferentiated m <dig> cells do express nse, its level increases due to differentiation. the formation of neurite-like processes as a part of synaptic organization and activity can be further characterized with the differential expression of the neurofilament proteins, nf-m, and –h that help form the neurofibrils within axons  <cit> . developing neurons generally do not express either of these neurofilament proteins until they become post-mitotic, which is fairly late in development. another neurofilament subunit, vimentin, decreases as neurons mature  <cit> . we were able to detect vimentin  and the neurofilament proteins -m as well as -h . we observed a decreased level of vimentin, whereas neurofilaments h and m increased due to differentiation. this might be an indication that under the conditions used, m <dig> cells could be in an early stage of maturation. this hypothesis is supported by the wide-spread expression of the immature neuronal marker β3-tubulin and the accumulation of synapsin-1/ <dig> at the tip of the growth cone . the presence of synapsin within the growth cone is consistent with studies suggesting an axonogenic role during neurite extension and branching, which is a early aspect of neuronal maturation  <cit> . the levels and localization of these developmentally staged proteins are anticipated to further change during prolonged culture in the presence of ra.

since m <dig> cells are multipotential with regard to neuronal enzyme expression, we looked at the effects of ra differentiation on the expression of the main isoforms of acetylcholine  receptors  and choline acetyltransferase  to determine the type of neurons that ra differentiated m <dig> cells could be. in figure  <dig>  nachr-α <dig> was the only one of the mentioned proteins that was able to be detected. this indicates that the ra differentiated m <dig> cells are not cholinergic but would most likely be involved in post- and pre-synaptic excitation in the brain and not post-ganglion nerves in the cns or exocrine glands  <cit> .

the differential expression of other neuronal proteins than those previously described, expression of voltage-gated ca2+ channels and ionotropic receptors, which ultimately lead to an increase in neurotransmitter release, can be used to confirm neuronal characteristics and neuroexocytosis. the presence of snap- <dig> and synapsin are indicative of the potential to form functioning pre-synaptic compartments that mediate synaptic vesicle fusion with the pre-synaptic membrane and neurotransmitter release under depolarizing conditions. although immunoblot demonstrated that overall synapsin expression in m <dig> cells does not significantly change after differentiation with ra , synapsin-1/ <dig> becomes distributed along processes, with a punctuate appearance  and within the growth cone during neuritogenesis . snap- <dig> is a major component of the snare complex that is required for the fusion of vesicle to the cell membrane for the exocytosis of neurotransmitters. a two fold increase in the level of snap- <dig>  was observed. this increase in snap- <dig> level may correlate with the significant  increase in kcl stimulated  glycine release seen in differentiated m <dig> cells . the increase in the stimulated release as shown in figure  <dig> doesn’t look impressive; however, it is quite marked because we are comparing the fraction of the total pool of  glycine that is released in differentiated cells vs. undifferentiated cells. as mentioned earlier, we studied  glycine release because this assay has been utilized successfully in assessment of neurotoxicity in cell culture models  <cit> . others have studied glutamate release and glutamate induced excitotoxicity in m <dig> cells  <cit>  and as such these cells could be suitable to study glutamate neurotoxicity. since m <dig> cells have been reported to have a poor gabaergic property  <cit>  these cells might not be a suitable model for gaba studies. in this report we demonstrated that a representative neurotransmitter function is enhanced in differentiated m <dig> cells compared to immature cells.

for functional neuroexocytosis, neurons need both the ability to form the snare complex and to have functional voltage-gated ca2+ channels. the ability of ca2+ and other ions to move across the cell membrane is necessary for excitation and signal transmission between neurons. therefore, we studied the uptake of ca2+ in both undifferentiated and differentiated m <dig> cells. there was no increase in the uptake of radiolabeled 45ca2+ using varying concentrations of kcl in undifferentiated m <dig> cells ; a strong increase in the uptake of radiolabeled 45ca2+ was observed with ra differentiation of m <dig> cells with a maximum opening of voltage-gated ca2+ channels at  <dig> mm kcl. the presence of both n and p/q type ca2+ channels was indicated by the  <dig> – 60% reduction in ca2+ uptake when conotoxin gvia   or agatoxin iva   were applied to the culture. using nnc 55– <dig>  only a small amount of t-type ca2+ channels were detected ; however, the assay may not be sensitive enough to pick up the small change in intracellular ca2+ concentration due to the small unitary conductance of t-type ca2+ channels. since neuroexocytosis is ca2+ dependent, the lack of functional voltage-gated ca2+ channels in undifferentiated m <dig> cells is detrimental for its use as a cell model for neurotoxicity research. the treatment of m <dig> with ra for a minimum of  <dig> hrs may be essential for functional neuronal cultures. it has been postulated that neuronal functions are cell maturation dependent  <cit> .

in toxicity studies, it is important to look at both morphological and functional changes to determine toxicological mechanisms. it has been shown here as well as in other studies that maturation of neuronal cultures is very important when studying the effects of toxicants  <cit> . it is known that intracellular ca2+ is highly regulated and involved in normal cell functions and in toxicological mechanisms. the lack of voltage-gated ca2+ channel expression in undifferentiated m <dig> cells could limit their use as a neurotoxicity model. this is supported by our observation that differentiation of m <dig> cells with ra was required to see the changes in i following exposure to cg. the i decrease due to cg is a toxicant response in neuronal cells that can lead to apoptosis and death of neurons  <cit> . acquisition in voltage-gated ca2+ channels in differentiated neurons may be a prerequisite for studying neurotoxicity due to chemicals other than cg.

CONCLUSIONS
the results reported here show that the human neuroblastoma be-m <dig> cells need to be treated with ra to become differentiated into mature neurons and to exhibit functional neuroexocytosis. differentiation with ra induces m <dig> cells to undergo morphological differentiation and synaptic maturation. the apparent formation of neural networks, the presence and function of snare proteins and voltage-gated ca2+ channels are necessary for functional neuroexocytosis. our results showing the presence of these characteristics supports the use of differentiated m <dig> cells as a cell model for neurobiology and/or neurotoxicity research.
