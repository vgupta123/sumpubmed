BACKGROUND
neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses  are the most common group of children's progressive neurodegenerative disorders with an estimated incidence of 1: <dig> in the usa and nordic countries and approximately 1: <dig>  <dig> worldwide . ncl disorders are mostly recessively inherited, and to date, eight different genes have been characterized to underlie these diseases  <cit> . despite having genetic heterogeneity, ncl diseases resemble each other both clinically and neuropathologically. the clinical course varies from severe congenital disease to milder adult-onset forms. ncls are phenotypically expressed by progressive mental deterioration, blindness, epileptic seizures and premature death. the pathological findings of these lysosomal storage disorders include intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment with variable ultrastructural appearance as well as progressive loss of neocortical neurons. the major component of the intracellular storage material is either the subunit c of the mitochondrial atp synthase  <cit>  or sphingolipid activator proteins a and d  <cit> . more recent analyses of different mouse models of ncl have exposed additional common features in the brain pathology .

the proteins encoded by ncl genes are localized in different compartments of the secretory pathway. palmitoyl protein thioesterase  <dig> , tripeptidyl-peptidase  <dig>  and cathepsin d  are soluble lysosomal enzymes  <cit> . cln <dig> and the recently identified mfsd <dig>  are transmembrane proteins localizing mainly to the late endosomal/lysosomal compartments  <cit> . two of the ncl proteins, cln <dig> and cln <dig>  reside mainly in the er  <cit> . despite the fact that many ncl proteins were characterized already a decade ago, the physiological functions of most ncl proteins are still not known and neither are the molecular connections between them understood  <cit> . cln <dig> is a glycoprotein disrupted in the finnish variant late infantile form of ncl   <cit> . the subcellular localization of overexpressed cln <dig> has been studied in bhk- <dig>  hela and cos- <dig> and cells, where it was found to be lysosomal  <cit> . in neuronal cells, cln <dig> is also present in the cellular extensions, but the specific organelle localization in neurons is still unidentified  <cit> . ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig> are also found in neuronal axons, where cln <dig> has been localized to synaptic vesicles and cln <dig> to synaptosomes  <cit> . controversial data has been reported about the solubility of the cln <dig> protein  <cit> , but both human and mouse cln <dig> have been found in the mannose 6-phosphoproteome, supporting the presence of soluble cln <dig> variants  <cit> . overall, the cln <dig> protein is not well conserved, lacks protein homologues and is currently poorly characterized. very little is also known about the interactions between different ncl proteins. vesa and co-workers have shown by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays that cln <dig> interacts with both cln <dig> and cln <dig>  <cit> , but the result has not been verified.

to obtain more knowledge of common pathways in ncls, we examined the interactions of cln <dig> with other ncl proteins utilizing pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. we report four novel interactions for cln <dig> and show that ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig> are connected at the level of intracellular trafficking.

methods
recombinant cln5-cdna constructs
mouse cln5-cdna lacking the suggested signal sequence  was cloned in frame with an n-terminal gst-tag in a pgex2t vector . for the co-immunoprecipitation assay, the full-length mcln5-cdna  was cloned into the pcdna <dig> a/myc-his expression vector  to produce a cln <dig> protein with a c-terminal tag. the trafficking-deficient human cln5-td  protein was obtained by inserting an intramolecular flag sequence after amino acid  <dig> into the full-length cln <dig>  pcmv <dig> construct, using the quickchange site-directed mutagenesis kit. all constructs were verified by sequencing.

cell culture, transfection and immunofluorescence analyses
hela and cos- <dig> cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium , supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum  and 1% antibiotics . for transient transfections, cells were plated on 6-well plates and the transfection was performed with lipofectamine™  <dig>  or fugene hd  transfection reagents according to manufacturers' instructions. for immunofluorescence analysis, transiently transfected cells were grown on coverslips, fixed with ice-cold methanol  <dig> h after transfection and stained with the specific antibodies described below. the labeled coverslips were mounted using gelmount  and visualized using leica dmr confocal microscope with tcs nt software . adobe photoshop and adobe illustrator softwares were used for image processing. all transfection and immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least three times.

antibodies
the human cln <dig> protein was detected either with a polyclonal rabbit antibody  raised against gst-mcln <dig>  or with a guinea pig antibody  raised against gst-mcln <dig>   <cit> . ppt <dig> and cln <dig> were detected with anti-ppt <dig> antibodies . cln <dig> was detected with the peptide antibody  <dig>  <cit> . cln <dig> was detected with a rabbit peptide antibody  <dig>   <cit>  and mouse monoclonal anti-ha antibody . the mouse monoclonal anti-lamp- <dig> antibody h4a <dig>  was obtained from the developmental studies hybridoma bank . the mouse monoclonal anti-flag antibody was from sigma and the mouse anti c-myc antibody  and the anti-his antibody from santa cruz biotechnology. the mouse monoclonal pdi  antibody was obtained from stressgen. the α- and β-subunits of the mitochondrial atp synthase were detected with monoclonal antibodies from molecular probes. the secondary antibodies used for the immunofluorescence analyses were from jackson immunoresearch and hrp-conjugated antibodies used for western blot detection were from dako.

mice
cln1-/-  mice  <cit>  and cln5-/- mice  <cit>  used in this study were maintained on a congenic c57/bl6j strain background. the study has been carried out following good practice in laboratory animal handling and the regulations for handling genetically modified organisms, and it was approved by the laboratory animal care and use committee of the national public health institute, helsinki. tissues for liver extraction were from adult mice.

quantitative real-time pcr
real-time pcr was performed as described in  <cit> . in short, cln5-/-, cln1-/- and wild-type cortices were prepared and total rna was extracted using rneasy mini kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions, followed by quantification by spectrophotometry. to average out the inter-individual variability, rna was extracted from the whole cortical area of four cln5-/- mice, four cln1-/- mice and four of their respective wt littermates and pooled together into two wild-type and two knock-out samples. to eliminate genomic dna, rna was treated with dnase i . the rt reactions were carried out on  <dig> ng of rna using taqman reverse transcription kit with random hexamer primers  as recommended by the manufacturer. taqman gene expression assays of selected genes were purchased from applied bio systems . the mrna expression levels of these genes and a standard house-keeping gene, mouse tata-box binding protein , were quantified using real-time pcr analysis  on an abi prism  <dig> sequence detection system . the pcr reactions  were carried out in triplicate with taqman universal master mix according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following parameters: 50°c for  <dig> min, 95°c for  <dig> min,  <dig> cycles of 95°c for  <dig> sec, 60°c for  <dig> min. relative levels of the selected genes were calculated using the ΔΔct method  <cit>  as described previously  <cit> . the absolute change in expression level is given by 2-ΔΔct. for illustrative purposes, the value for the wt gene expression was set to  <dig> and cln <dig> as well as ppt <dig> expression values are shown relative to that.

gst pull-down assays
the gst-mcln <dig> fusion construct was expressed in e. coli and purified by binding to the glutathione-sepharose 4b beads  for  <dig> h at 4°c. for the search of ncl binding partners, cytosolic extracts of cos- <dig> cells were prepared by lysing the cells in lysis buffer  and removing the cell debris by centrifugation. gst vector control and gst-mcln <dig> fusion protein were incubated with  <dig> ml of cos lysates  overnight at 4°c. the beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and the samples were separated by sds-page under reducing conditions, immunoblotted and probed for different ncl proteins.

the α- and β-subunits of the mitochondrial atp synthase were pulled down with gst-mcln <dig> and gst-hppt128- <dig>  <cit>  from the enriched lysosomal/mitochondrial fraction originating from the mouse liver. briefly, mouse liver of wt, cln5-/- or cln1-/- mouse was homogenized  in hb buffer  and centrifuged at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min at 4°c. the post-nuclear supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and centrifuged again at  <dig>  <dig> rpm for  <dig> min at 4°c. the pellet was then dissolved with  <dig>  ml of eb buffer . the gst pull-downs were done by incubating  <dig> ml  of enriched liver lysosomal/mitochondrial fractions with different gst fusion proteins  over night at 4°c. the beads were then carefully washed with the eb buffer. samples were separated by sds-page, immunoblotted and probed for α- and β-subunits. all pull-down experiments were repeated at least twice.

co-immunoprecipitation assay
ppt1/cln <dig> was transiently expressed together with mcln5-myc/his or with an opr1l-his  <cit>  control protein in cos- <dig> cells. the cells were lysed into an immunoprecipitation buffer  and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. immunoprecipitation was done by adding a his-specific antibody  and incubating the samples on ice for three hours. immunocomplexes were then captured by incubation with protein a/g plus agarose beads  over night at 4°c. agarose beads were then gently centrifuged  and washed three times with the ip-buffer. samples were separated by sds-page, immunoblotted and probed for ppt1/cln <dig> 

RESULTS
interactions of cln <dig> with other ncl proteins
the possible interactions of cln <dig> with other ncl proteins were investigated with gst pull-down experiments. a gst-cln <dig> fusion protein expressing the mouse cln <dig> lacking the signal sequence  was used to pull down endogenous ncl proteins from both mouse brain extract and hela cell lysates . to avoid the possible false negative binding results due to low endogenous levels of most ncl proteins, the pull-downs were also prepared from lysates of cos- <dig> cells transiently transfected with different ncl proteins . the bound proteins were identified by western blot analyses. vesa and co-workers have previously shown by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro-binding assays that cln <dig> interacts with cln <dig> and cln <dig>  <cit> . in our pull-down experiments, we could also capture cln <dig> and cln <dig> with gst-mcln <dig> , which was considered to serve as a positive control for our further pull-down analyses. the cln <dig> antibody recognized both the  <dig> kda precursor and the mature, lysosomal  <dig> kda form of cln <dig>  <cit>  in the cell lysate, but only the mature form showed prominent binding with gst-mcln <dig>  this suggests that the interaction between cln <dig> and cln <dig> most likely occurs in the late endocytic compartments. three novel interactions between ncl proteins were additionally discovered, as ppt1/cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig> were also shown to bind to gst-mcln <dig> . all proteins except cln <dig> could also be pulled down endogenously from brain and hela cell lysates . the specificity of the pull-down experiments was tested by using lamp- <dig>  a lysosomal membrane protein, as a control. it showed no binding to gst-mcln <dig> . after lamp- <dig> detection, the membrane was reprobed with anti-cln <dig> antibody as a positive control for the pull-down experiment . altogether, the gst-mcln <dig> interactions found here cover both soluble and transmembrane ncl proteins residing both in the er and the lysosomes, thus suggesting that cln <dig> has the capacity to bind different ncl proteins at different cellular localizations. this observation indicates that cln <dig> may play a role as a factor that connects different ncl proteins.

analyses of intracellular trafficking of cln <dig> together with the interacting proteins
to dissect the role of cln <dig> interactions with other ncl proteins in vivo, we first compared the localization of the newly characterized interaction partners in wild type and cln5-/- mouse fibroblasts  <cit> . fibroblasts were transiently transfected with constructs producing different ncl proteins  and fluorescently labeled with antibodies against the ncl proteins as well as specific organelle markers. however, no differences in the localization of any of the interacting ncl proteins could be detected between the wild type and cln5-/- cells . we also studied the possible effects of simultaneous overexpression of wild type hcln <dig> and the interaction partners on the protein localization in hela cells. transient overexpression did not influence the localization of cln <dig>  cln <dig>  cln <dig> or cln <dig> . the hydrophobic cln <dig> was found in lysosomes, but was often detected also in the er together with cln <dig>  most probably reflecting a folding defect in a situation in which two proteins are overexpressed . this could reflect an overloading of the er protein folding machinery.

to assess whether severe defects in the transport of cln <dig> could affect the localization of any of the interacting proteins, co-expressions were performed using a trafficking-deficient hcln <dig> polypeptide , representing a protein restricted to the er. the intramolecular insertion of a flag-tag  restrained the cln5-td polypeptide into the er in hela cells . interestingly, when the wild type ppt1/cln <dig> was co-expressed with this er-resident construct, it was also retained in the er . to control the specificity of the observed restriction on ppt <dig> transport by cln <dig>  ppt1/cln <dig> was also overexpressed together with trafficking-deficient cln3-flag <dig>  and er-resident cln <dig> . neither of these proteins affected the lysosomal trafficking of ppt1/cln <dig>  the transport of cln <dig> from the er was also delayed when it was co-expressed with the er-resident cln5-td; cln <dig> was detected in the lysosomes, but was additionally seen in the er . however, the effect was milder compared to that seen with ppt1/cln <dig> and therefore was thought to result from problems in protein folding in the er. trafficking of the endogenous cln <dig> was not altered due to overexpression of cln5-td and it was correctly transported to the lysosomes . as assumed, the er-resident proteins cln <dig>  and cln <dig>  remained in the er and were not detectably influenced by the transport defect of cln5-td.

overexpression of wild type ppt1/cln <dig> rescues the lysosomal trafficking of cln5finmajor polypeptide
as the most dramatic influence on the localization of the binding partners of cln <dig> was seen for ppt1/cln <dig>  it was of interest to study if the expression of cln <dig> possessing the most common vlinclfin disease-causing mutation  would also influence the trafficking of ppt1/cln <dig>  the cln5finmajor mutation results in a truncated polypeptide lacking  <dig> amino acids from the c-terminus  <cit>  and it has been demonstrated to localize to the er and golgi instead of lysosomes  <cit> . importantly, this mutant protein represents an er exit-competent cln <dig>  in contrast to the cln5-td which is a strict er-resident. we first expressed the wild type ppt <dig> with wild type cln <dig> in hela cells and found that the two proteins completely co-localized in the lysosomes . the mutated cln5finmajor polypeptides expressed alone did not show co-localization with the lysosomal marker, lamp- <dig>  but were retained in the er in hela cells . interestingly, simultaneous overexpression of wild type ppt <dig> with cln5finmajor resulted in a positive effect on the trafficking of the mutated cln <dig>  and both proteins were found in the lysosomes . to verify the results obtained in hela cells, we repeated the experiments also in human neuroblastoma cells . simultaneous overexpression of wild type ppt1/cln <dig> and cln5finmajor in sh-sy5y cells again resulted in co-localization of the two proteins in lamp- <dig> positive late endosomes/lysosomes, whereas the cln5finmajor expressed alone was detected only in the er . wild type ppt1/cln <dig> seemed thus to have a positive effect on the transport of cln5finmajor when overexpressed in the same cell, being able to facilitate the trafficking of the mutated cln <dig> from the er into the late endosomal compartments.

ppt1/cln <dig> mutants retained in the er do not restrict the lysosomal trafficking of cln5
as ppt1/cln <dig> was found to facilitate trafficking of the mutated cln5finmajor, we wanted to study whether it is a prerequisite for the lysosomal trafficking of cln <dig>  we overexpressed ppt1/cln <dig> carrying either the most common incl disease mutation   <cit>  or the adult-onset causing mutation   <cit>  together with the wt cln <dig> in hela cells. the localization of the proteins was then studied by confocal microscopy. both ppt1fin  and ppt1adult  localized to the er, whereas the wt cln <dig> was found in the lysosomes . the mutated ppt1/cln <dig> proteins were never detected in lysosomes suggesting that cln <dig> lacks the positive targeting effect found in the opposite situation with wt ppt1/cln <dig>  this could, however, result from a defective interaction between the two proteins due to ppt <dig> mutations. to study this, we used gst-mcln <dig> to pull down overexpressed ppt1fin and ppt1adult proteins from the cos- <dig> cell lysates. both of the mutated ppt1/cln <dig> proteins were pulled down with cln <dig>  similarly to the wt protein , demonstrating that the interaction between the two proteins was maintained. these data indicated that although ppt1/cln <dig> can facilitate the lysosomal trafficking of cln5finmajor, cln <dig> cannot rescue the restricted trafficking of the mutated ppt1/cln <dig> to the lysosomes.

co-immunoprecipitation and compensatory mrna expression support the relationship between cln <dig> and cln5
both our pull-down and trafficking experiments indicated a strong interaction between cln <dig> and cln <dig>  but since this interaction was not detected in the previous co-immunoprecipitation assay  <cit> , we wanted to strengthen our data with additional experiments. therefore, we also performed a co-immunoprecipation assay and analyzed the mrna expression of the binding partner protein both in cln <dig> and cln <dig> deficient mice. in the co-immunoprecipitation assay, ppt1/cln <dig> was expressed together with mcln5-myc/his or with a control protein orp1l-his  <cit>  in cos- <dig> cells. mcln5-myc/his and orp1l-his were immunoprecipitated with a his-specific antibody followed by ppt1/cln <dig> detection by western blot analysis. ppt1/cln <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with cln <dig>  especially the tri- and diglycosylated forms, supporting the binding of the premature er forms of ppt1/cln <dig>  <cit>  to cln <dig>  the control protein orp1l showed no binding to ppt1/cln <dig> .

real time pcr was performed from the cortices of wt, cln <dig> and cln <dig> deficient mice to detect the possible dependence of the disruption of one binding partner on the expression of the other. analyses of mrna expression levels in brain tissues showed significant upregulation of the cln <dig> mrna in the four-month old cln <dig> deficient mice, indicating a possible compensatory response. the mrna levels of cln <dig> were only slightly upregulated in the brain tissue of the cln <dig> deficient mice . altogether, these results strengthened our novel findings and suggested a possible functional connection between cln <dig> and cln <dig> proteins.

interaction of cln <dig> with the subunits of f1-atp synthase
we have recently shown that ppt1/cln <dig> co-purifies in a large protein complex and interacts with the f1-complex of atp synthase  <cit> . due to our novel findings, we tested whether cln <dig> would also interact with the f1-complex. we used gst-mcln <dig> to pull-down proteins from an enriched lysosomal/mitochondrial fraction prepared from mouse liver. interestingly, both α- and β-subunits of the f1-complex showed interaction with cln <dig> . to test whether ppt <dig> or cln <dig> require each other for their respective interactions with the f1-complex, the experiment was repeatedly performed using lysosomal/mitochondrial fractions extracted from both cln1-/- and cln5-/- mice lacking the respective proteins. the β-subunit was able to bind both gst-hppt <dig> in the absence of cln <dig> and gst-mcln <dig> in the absence of ppt <dig>  indicating that the proteins interact with the β-subunit independent of each other . these results show that in addition to an interaction between ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig>  the proteins share another binding partner not belonging to the group of ncl proteins.

discussion
clinical and neuropathological similarities in ncl disorders may result from functional redundancy or co-operation of different ncl proteins. initial evidence of co-operation has previously been obtained from activity measurements and gene expression analyses. for example, cln2/tpp <dig> activity has been shown to be elevated in other forms of ncl  <cit> . furthermore, the mrna expression levels of a variety of ncl genes have been reported to be altered in different ncls  <cit> . recent studies of animal models have further supported a common mechanism in the disease pathogenesis of the ncls. selective loss of interneurons, early defects on thalamocortical neuron survival as well as early glial responses are detected in different mouse models as well as in large animal models  <cit> . molecular interactions between ncl proteins have also been reported previously  <cit> . here we continued the search for ncl protein interactions and their intracellular consequences. we demonstrate that cln <dig> has molecular connections to at least to five other ncl proteins, namely cln1/ppt <dig>  cln2/tpp <dig>  cln <dig>  cln <dig> and cln <dig>  suggesting a central role for cln <dig> in the ncl network.

mutations of cln <dig> and consequent trafficking defects can result in functional consequences on the interacting proteins, as well as in changes in their distribution. most ncl proteins are not, however, detectable endogenously by immunofluorescence analyses using the currently available antibodies and therefore this hypothesis could not be tested in patient fibroblasts. however, simultaneous overexpression of binding partners with the modified, transport incompetent cln5-td  construct suggested that the interaction between ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig> is strong and occurs already in the er, where the interactions between cln <dig> and the two er resident ncl proteins, cln <dig> and cln <dig>  would also naturally occur. since cln <dig> resides in the lumen of intracellular organelles, interaction between cln <dig> and the transmembrane proteins must be mediated by the lumenal domains of these proteins. the finding that ncl interactions can occur already in the er is important since previous studies have also suggested that the er is an important organelle for the function and/or trafficking of ncl proteins. for example, cln <dig> carrying the most common jncl mutation  <cit>  has been reported to preserve a significant function in the er. although the mutated cln <dig> is retained in the er, it was shown to be able to affect the size of lysosomes  <cit> . furthermore, our data suggest that tpp1/cln <dig>  another lysosomal enzyme, is likely to interact with cln <dig> only in the late endosomes/lysosomes. this was supported both by the interaction analysis and the unaffected transport of cln <dig>  therefore, the present data suggest that interactions between cln <dig> and other ncl proteins can occur along the secretory pathway, and the interactions are not strictly dependent on the steady-state localization or the solubility of the ncl proteins.

based on our trafficking experiments, the main focus was on the interaction between ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig>  unlike the transport deficient, strictly er-resident cln5-td, the er exit competent cln5finmajor did not prevent the lysosomal trafficking of ppt <dig> but rather, ppt <dig> was able to facilitate the trafficking of the mutated cln <dig> from the er and golgi to the lysosomes. lysosomal proteins have also previously been shown to assist each other in their lysosomal trafficking. for example, the clc <dig> chloride transporter, involved in an ncl-like disorder in mouse, has been shown to facilitate the transport of ostm <dig> to the lysosomes, where the proteins act together in lysosomal chloride transport  <cit> . it was also recently demonstrated that the lysosomal membrane protein limp- <dig> is required for the mannose 6-phosphate receptor-independent targeting of β-glucocerebrosidase. interestingly, the overexpression of limp- <dig> was also able to facilitate the transport of the mutated, trafficking deficient β-glucocerebrosidase from the er to the lysosomes  <cit> . both ppt <dig> and cln <dig> are soluble intravesicular proteins and are not able to interact with cytoplasmic sorting and transport machinery per se, like clc <dig> and limp- <dig>  however, trafficking of cln1/ppt <dig> has been reported to show properties different from classic lysosomal enzymes  <cit>  and we have recently discovered that also cln <dig> can use m6pr-independent pathways for its lysosomal trafficking . therefore, it is possible that the formation of the cln1-cln <dig> complex may be important for utilizing other trafficking pathways than the classical m6pr pathway. in which circumstances this is required in vivo, remains to be studied in further experiments.

a close connection between ppt1/cln <dig> and cln <dig> has already been suggested in previous studies. the proteins share similar expression patterns in the mouse brain and in the prenatal human brain  <cit> . our recent global gene expression profiling analyses of the cln1-/- and cln5-/- mouse brains implicated a common defective pathway mediated by phosphorylation and potentially affecting the maturation of axons and neuronal growth cones  <cit> . here, we provide further evidence for a tight relationship between the two proteins by showing not only the interaction between the proteins but also, demonstrating significantly increased expression levels of cln <dig> mrna in the cln5-/- mouse brain tissue. this suggests a possible compensatory role for ppt <dig> in cln <dig> deficiency. functional connection of cln <dig> and ppt <dig> is also suggested by the shared interaction partner not belonging to the ncl protein family, the f1-atp synthase. the ectopic f1-atp synthase has been shown to function as an apoa-i receptor on the plasma membrane  <cit>  and both the amount of the f1-complex as well as the uptake of apoa-i have been shown to be increased in cln1-/- mouse neurons  <cit> . therefore, both ppt <dig> and cln <dig> could be connected to the maintenance of lipid homeostasis. in general, accumulating evidence has indicated dysregulated lipid metabolism in different forms of ncls and several ncl proteins have been functionally linked to lipid metabolism .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show novel interactions between the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis protein cln <dig> and five other ncl proteins. consequently, our study strengthens the long-term hypothesis of a common cellular pathway behind the ncls and suggests that different mutations in a given ncl protein may lead to different pathological outcomes through variable distinct effects on the ncl protein network. the strongest interaction was detected between cln <dig> and ppt1/cln <dig>  and ppt1/cln <dig> was shown to be able to contribute to the intracellular trafficking of the mutated cln <dig>  the phenomenon, which may be important when planning the therapy for vlinclfin. deficiency of cln <dig> was also shown to result in upregulation of cln <dig> expression in the mouse brain, suggesting a dependency for cln1/ppt <dig> over cln <dig>  for the first time, the two ncl proteins were shown to share an interaction partner outside the ncl protein spectrum, since cln <dig> and ppt <dig> both interacted with the f1-complex of the atp synthase. this finding may be important in characterization of the cellular functions of the ncl proteins.
