BACKGROUND
larches are very useful for afforestation because of their fast juvenile growth  <cit> . among the various larches, hybrids of larix kaempferi × larix olgensis are widely planted in the mountainous regions of northeastern china for their high-quality timber, their pest resistance, and their amenity value  <cit> . the use of rooted stem cuttings is becoming the most popular method to propagate these hybrids. adventitious root formation is a key step for stem cuttings, and it is a complex process affected by many factors  <cit> . despite the ecological and economical importance of larch, little genomic research has been conducted on this species. it would be very useful to understand the biological process of adventitious root formation and development in larch.

in our previous study, two clones of l. kaempferi × l. olgensis, 25- <dig> and 23- <dig>  are obviously different on the rooting rates, which were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. so, the two clones are good materials for studying the biological process of adventitious root formation. additionally, we had examined the development process of adventitious roots in semi-lignified cuttings of hybrid larch  <cit> , which consisted of three key stages: 14- <dig> days after cutting  for cell dedifferentiation and division; 25- <dig> dac for meristem formation and development; 50- <dig> dac for root formation and elongation. the early stages,  <dig> and  <dig> dac, were crucial for the expression and regulation of rooting-related genes. these anatomical and physiological researches on adventitious roots development in hybrid larch make the further study on the molecular mechanisms governing adventitious root development feasible.

although adventitious root formation is the key developmental process for asexual propagation of most plants, the molecular mechanisms of adventitious root formation are still poorly understood  <cit> , because adventitious root formation is a complex quantitative genetic trait regulated by both environmental and endogenous factors. only a limited number of molecular studies of adventitious root formation have been performed. brinker et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes during different developmental stages of adventitious root formation in pinus contorta hypocotyls which were treated with the auxin indole-3-butyric acid. butler et al.  <cit>  focused on gene expression patterns during adventitious root formation, and a number of mrnas during adventitious root formation in apple were identified. sorin et al.  <cit>  identified some molecular markers which positively or negatively correlated with adventitious root formation by a proteomic analysis of different mutant genotypes of arabidopsis. chen et al.  <cit>  provided a method suitable to study de novo root organogenesis. ahkami et al.  <cit>  identify specific genes determining the initiation and formation of adventitious roots by a microarray-based transcriptome analysis in the stem base of the cuttings of petunia hybrida . subramaniyam et al.  <cit>  obtained a comprehensive transcript expression profiling for adventitious roots of panax ginseng meyer. however, very few genes were characterized for adventitious root formation of larch, due to the limited genome information.

rna sequencing represents a powerful and rapid method for obtaining functional information on a genome-wide scale, especially for the large genomes and non-model species. wu et al.  <cit>  studied gene expression in north american ginseng root samples at seven developmental stages by  <dig> sequencing. their results suggested that ginsenoside biosynthesis occurs at distinct stages of development. firon et al.  <cit>  identified the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of storage root formation in sweet potato by rna sequencing. alagna et al.  <cit>  enriched the very small amount of sequence data currently available for olive, and identified genes involved in fruit quality via  <dig> pyrosequencing. extensive analyses of transcriptome profiles  <cit>  have identified functional genes with roles in specific biological processes. however, changes in mrna transcript levels do not always reflect changes in protein levels, and there are many ways in which cellular events are regulated at the protein level. therefore, a complementary protein analysis is necessary to clarify the molecular events at particular stages of development. two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis  combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  has many advantages for protein analysis. li et al.  <cit>  detected significant changes in the abundance of certain proteins in cucumber roots in response to hypoxia using 2d-dige. yan et al.  <cit>  used a proteomic analysis to study the responses to growth restriction in maize plants supplied with sufficient nitrogen. wang et al.  <cit>  identified proteins involved in brassinosteroid regulation of rice growth using 2d-dige followed by ms. the results of those studies illustrated that transcriptomic or proteomic analyses are effective methods to find genes and proteins involved in regulating biological processes. yang et al.  <cit>  combined use of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of m <dig> leaves and roots under nacl treatment in sugar beet, these analyses revealed candidate genes and proteins for detailed functional characterization.

in this study, to gain a better understanding of adventitious root development in hybrid larch, we evaluated the transcriptomic profiles of two clones with different rooting capacity at two important stages of adventitious root development. some of the genes identified as being differentially expressed between the two clones were further analyzed at the protein level. these data can remarkably expand the transcriptome and proteome database of larch, and provides a valuable platform to understand the molecular basis of regulation of adventitious root development in larch and other conifers.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing
compared with other techniques, the  <dig> pyrosequencing technique is a better alternative for de novo sequencing and analysis of the transcriptomes of non-model plants, because of the high number of reads generated per run and the low sequencing error rate in the obtained contigs  <cit> . this technology has been used to construct a number of expressed sequence tag  libraries from plants including including maize  <cit> , chestnut  <cit> , olive  <cit> , north american ginseng  <cit> , and sweet potato  <cit> . zhang et al.  <cit>  used  <dig> sequencing to analyze japanese larch during somatic embryogenesis. in this study, we constructed four cdna libraries from two clones at two important stages of adventitious root development. each of the cdna libraries was sequenced using the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform. a total of  <dig>  raw reads were produced from the four cdna libraries. most of the raw reads were between  <dig> and 500 bp long. after trimming adapter sequences and removing short sequences of less than  <dig> bases, a total of  <dig>  high-quality reads were generated from the four cdna libraries. therefore,  <dig> % of raw reads were useful. the length distribution of these high-quality reads is shown in figure  <dig>  approximately 90% of the reads were between  <dig> and 500 bp in length.figure  <dig> 
distribution of lengths of high-quality reads obtained by  <dig> sequencing.




these  <dig>  high-quality reads were assembled into  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons . the distribution of contig lengths is shown in figure 2;  <dig> %  of contigs were 300–800 bp long, and  <dig> %  of contigs were 400–500 bp long. the median contig length was 739 bp, while the average contig length was 663 bp. the lengths of unigenes were similar to those obtained in previous transcriptome analyses of artemisia  <cit> , chestnut  <cit> , american ginseng  <cit> , and cucurbita pepo  <cit> . the data shown here represent the first large-scale effort to generate cdna resources and analyze the transcriptomes of hybrid larch during adventitious root development. these resources have been made publically available; the raw data have been submitted to the short read archive  division of the genbank repository . the transcriptomic sequences should be useful for gene discovery in larch, and will be helpful for elucidating the genomic basis of adventitious root development.figure  <dig>

functional annotation and classification
all unique sequences were first compared with sequences in the non-redundant database  of the ncbi using the blastn algorithm. then, they were compared with sequences in the two major public protein databases  using the blastx algorithm. when the e-value cutoff was set at 10- <dig>  a total of  <dig> contig sequences were annotated, which accounted for  <dig> % of all contig sequences.

in principle, the higher the number of reads assembled in a contig, the higher the number of mrna molecules encoding that gene in a given tissue sample. the read numbers of more than  <dig> are shown in additional file  <dig>  among of the  <dig> contigs,  <dig> were involved in cell wall remodeling during plant growth and development,  <dig> were involved in the adaptive stress response and regulation of expression of many stress-responsive genes, and  <dig> were involved in polyamine synthesis. the others were involved in protein translation, synthesis, and degradation. plant cell walls play many critical roles during plant growth, including regulation of cell differentiation, intercellular adhesion and communication, and defense against invasions by pests and pathogens  <cit> , knowing which genes are involved in the formation and remodeling of plant cell walls is of great importance. cell wall remodeling-related genes detected in this study should be related to the wound of cuttings. stress-related genes could enhance survival of various cell types against stress. polyamines are key regulators in cell growth and differentiation, the detection of polyamine synthesis-related genes should be related to the different development stages of adventitious root. the detailed discussion of stress-related genes and polyamine synthesis-related genes could be found in the following sections.

we used the gene ontology  classification system to determine the possible functions of tagged genes. the go ontology analysis showed that the distributions of gene functions for cdna sequences from 25- <dig> and 23- <dig> on 14 days after cutting  and  <dig> dac were similar . the functions of the identified genes covered various biological processes. among  <dig> unigenes ,  <dig> unigenes were classified into the biological process  category,  <dig> unigenes were classified into cellular component , and  <dig> unigenes were classified into molecular function . the bp, cc, and mf categories in the go classification system contained  <dig> subgroups , which covered the whole profile of gene expression in hybrid larch. the numbers of genes involved in some categories were significant difference between  <dig> dac and  <dig> dac . for 25- <dig> , the “catalytic activity” and “binding” genes were detected increased at  <dig> dac than  <dig> dac , which was almost no change for 23- <dig> . “catalytic activity” and “binding” genes, involved in many biological processes, were detected increased at adventitious root meristem formation stage , which would play an important effect on root formation. for 23- <dig> , the “reproductive process” genes were detected significant decrease at  <dig> dac , which was almost no change for 25- <dig> . although the “immune system process” genes have no significant changes between  <dig> dac and  <dig> dac for 25- <dig> and 23- <dig> separately, the genes increased  <dig> % at  <dig> dac for 25- <dig>  decreased  <dig> % at  <dig> dac for 23- <dig>  which would be better for 25- <dig> to form adventitious roots. adventitious root formation is a complex process regulated by many factors, the “signaling process” genes were significant increase at  <dig> dac for 25- <dig> , but almost no change for 23- <dig>  which indicated signaling process involved in regulation of adventitious root meristem formation . the detailed information of the number of detected genes between  <dig> dac and  <dig> dac and the p values of each go category were shown in additional file  <dig> figure  <dig>

differentially expressed proteins
the profiles of proteins extracted from cutting tissue on  <dig> dac,  <dig> dac, and  <dig> dac were investigated using a proteomics approach. we detected  <dig> differentially expressed proteins  by 2d-dige. these proteins were subsequently analyzed using decyder™ software . approximately one-third of the differentially expressed proteins  were present at  <dig> dac . we successfully identified  <dig> proteins using maldi-tof/tof-ms. detailed information for these proteins are shown in additional file  <dig>  for most of the proteins, the theoretical molecular mass  and calculated isoelectric point  was consistent with experimental data, as judged from the location of spots on 2d-dige gels . however, there were some exceptions, such as spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which had theoretical mms greater than the corresponding identified proteins, and spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  which had theoretical mms smaller than the corresponding identified proteins . several proteins, had the same functional annotation, showed in several different spots  on the gel . this phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies  <cit> . there are several possible explanations for this, including post-translational modification, protein degradation, different encoding genes, and protein translation from alternatively spliced mrnas. another possibility is that these spots represented protein homologs unique to larch.figure  <dig>

. proteins were separated as described in materials and methods. eighty-six differentially expressed proteins  were detected by 2d-dige and subsequently analyzed using decyder™ software. seventy-five proteins identified successfully by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry  are shown on this gel. arrows indicate differentially expressed proteins between 25- <dig> and 23-12; numbers following arrows correspond to additional file  <dig>  each spot on gel represents a protein. molecular mass is shown on vertical axis; isoelectric point is shown in horizontal axis.



the  <dig> identified proteins could be divided into eight categories according to their functional annotation . of these proteins,  <dig> % were involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism,  <dig> % in protein translation and degradation,  <dig> % in cell defense,  <dig> % in hormone-related activities,  <dig> % in signal transduction,  <dig> % in rna transcription and processing, and a few were involved in other metabolic pathways. proteins of unknown function made up 24% of the  <dig> identified proteins. figure 6a,b shows the abundance of some of the differentially expressed proteins at different stages of adventitious root development.figure  <dig>

one notable result was that the expression patterns of s-adenosylmethionine synthetase  <dig>  and s-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase , which are involved in polyamine synthesis, and a late-embryogenesis-abundant protein  and an intracellular pathogenesis-related protein , which are involved in stress responses, were the same as those detected for their encoding genes in the transcriptomic analysis. the detailed discussions of the effects of these genes on adventitious root development are showed in “elucidation of important signaling pathways” part.

elucidation of important signaling pathways
polyamine synthesis pathway
polyamines are small polycationic molecules; the main polyamines in living organisms are putrescine , spermidine , and spermine   <cit> . they are found ubiquitously in living organisms and function in a wide variety of biological processes. polyamine biosynthesis involves a series of steps catalyzed by specific enzymes  <cit> , including samdc and sams. in this study, the contigs un_lyscdhit99_ <dig> and un_lyscdhit99_ <dig> were annotated as sams <dig> and samdc proenzymes, respectively, in the transcriptome data . the read numbers assembled in these two genes in 25- <dig>  were higher than those in 23- <dig>  at the root cell dedifferentiation and division stage  and at the root initial cell formation stage . in the proteomic profile, two proteins were identified as sams <dig>  and samdc ; importantly, these two proteins were expressed at higher levels in 25- <dig> than in 23- <dig> on both  <dig> dac and  <dig> dac . the samdc protein was also up-regulated at  <dig> dac . this result that polyamines play a role in regulating root development is consistent with the results of other studies. for example, tisi et al.  <cit>  showed that polyamine catabolism strongly affected root development and xylem differentiation in maize . niemi et al.  <cit>  showed that polyamines accelerated adventitious root formation and increased subsequent root growth of scots pine  hypocotyl cuttings in vitro. tang and newton  <cit>  demonstrated that polyamines promoted root elongation and growth in regenerated virginia pine plantlets. in other studies, polyamines were shown to improve the rooting rate  <cit> , regulate vascular development  <cit> , and enhance tolerance of the root to salinity-alkalinity stress  <cit> . in this study, the expression of samdc and sams <dig> at the transcriptional and translational levels demonstrated that polyamines play an important role in regulating adventitious root development in hybrid larch, possibly via increasing root cell division and enhancing tolerance of the roots to stresses.table  <dig>

stress response pathway
cuttings excised from plants are subjected to several stresses, such as wounding and pathogen attack. the responses of cuttings to stresses are complex and involve a number of metabolic changes to protect cells and macromolecules. in this study, contigs of un_lyscdhit99_ <dig> and un_lyscdhit99_ <dig> were annotated as an embryo-abundant protein and a putative intracellular pathogenesis-related protein, respectively . both of these proteins are related to various stress responses. we identified corresponding proteins in the proteomic profile; the embryo-abundant protein corresponded to spot  <dig>  and the intracellular pathogenesis-related protein corresponded to spot  <dig> 

the late embryogenesis abundant  protein family is a large family that includes proteins that accumulate at late stages of seed development or in vegetative tissues in response to some stresses. many studies have shown that lea proteins have important effects on salt tolerance in plants. aghaei et al.  <cit>  showed that a lea protein was up-regulated in the hypocotyl and root of soybean treated with 100 mm nacl. zhang et al.  <cit>  identified a putative salt-tolerance gene lea <dig> in thellungiella salsuginea, and confirmed that tslea <dig> conferred salt tolerance when expressed in yeast and transgenic arabidopsis. bai et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that transgenic tobacco expressing the lea3- <dig> protein encoded by a gene from medicago sativa showed enhanced salt tolerance. park et al.  <cit>  showed that lea <dig> might positively regulate the response to dehydration by enhancing root cell lignification in sweet potato. overexpression of smlea showed faster root elongation and a higher salt and drought tolerance in salvia miltiorrhiza  <cit> . in this study, a lea protein was annotated in the transcriptome data. the read number assembled in this gene was higher in clone 25- <dig>  than in clone 23- <dig>  at the root cell dedifferentiation and division stage . consistent with this, the corresponding protein was expressed at higher levels in 25- <dig> than in 23- <dig> at  <dig> dac . however, the read number assembled in lea was lower in 25- <dig> than in 23- <dig> at the root initial cell formation stage , and there was no significant difference in the read number assembled in lea between 25- <dig> and 23- <dig> at  <dig> dac . together, these findings conjectured that this lea might positively regulate the response to various stresses by enhancing lignification of cuttings, mainly at the early stage of adventitious root development.

pathogenesis-related  proteins are plant proteins induced by abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . they accumulate around damaged cell walls to protect plants against infection by fungi, bacteria, or viruses  <cit> . many studies have shown that pr proteins have important effects on root development. bantignies et al.  <cit>  showed that a pr-10-like protein was constitutively expressed at all stages of root development in roots of white lupin. borghi et al.  <cit>  showed that pr genes affected potassium homeostasis in arabidopsis thaliana. takeuchi et al.  <cit>  identified a root-specific pr protein induced by drought and salt treatments in rice. immunohistochemical analyses showed that this protein strongly accumulated in cortex cells around the vascular system of roots. koehler et al.  <cit>  identified pr proteins associated with cold tolerance in strawberry. the abundance of prprotein <dig>  significantly increased in wheat seminal roots after 7 days of waterlogging  <cit> . in this study, the expression of a pr protein at transcriptional and translational levels implied that it has a role in adventitious root development. it was significantly up-regulated in 25- <dig>  at the adventitious root cell dedifferentiation and division stage  . therefore, it may play a crucial role in protecting the cuttings from damage caused by bacteria and fungi, mainly at the early stage after cutting, thus allowing normal adventitious root development.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, two clones of hybrid larch, different on rooting capacity, were analyzed from rna and protein level. a transcriptome database of adventitious root development was generated included a total of  <dig> raw reads, which would be useful to future molecular studies of larch. the protein profile of adventitious root development was also analyzed,  <dig> proteins were identified, which enriched the protein database. a joint analysis of transcriptome and proteome showed.that genes related to polyamine synthesis and the stress response might play an important role on adventitious root development. this study provides fundamental and important information for subsequent studies on the molecular mechanism of adventitious roots development. furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time the combined use of two important technologies as a powerful approach for studying non-model, but otherwise important, larch species.
