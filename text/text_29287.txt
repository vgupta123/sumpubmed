BACKGROUND
cattle  are considered to have been one of the first animals domesticated by man for agricultural purposes. approximately  <dig>  years ago, cattle ancestors  were tamed to provide milk, meat and hides and for draft purposes  <cit> . bos taurus was also one of the first animal species to enter the genomics era. in the past few years, genetic information based on molecular markers has increasingly been used in cattle breeding improvement programmes, as a mean to improve conventionally phenotypic selection, particularly for traits with low heritability or for which measurement of phenotype is difficult, expensive, only possible late in life, sex-limited or not possible on selection candidates  <cit> . advances in molecular genetics have led to the identification of several genes or genetic markers associated with genes that affect economic traits  <cit> . for example, the non conservative k232a substitution in the acylcoa:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  gene has a major effect on milk yield and composition  <cit> . several of these genetic markers are now available and used in industry marker-assisted selection programmes  <cit> .

because of its economical importance bos taurus was one of the first mammals to have its genome sequenced. in august  <dig>  the sequence of the cattle genome was released by the human genome sequencing center at baylor college of medicine  <cit> . during the sequencing more than  <dig>  million putative single nucleotide polymorphisms  were identified and deposited in public databases  <cit> . the bovine genome sequencing consortium has since discovered approximately  <dig>  extra high-quality snps  <cit> . these snps have been used to develop a whole-genome cattle snp genotyping microarray  <cit> . more recently, a novel higher-density whole-genome bovine snp beadchip, containing ~ <dig>  snps has being developed by illumina  <cit> .

with the availability of genome-wide dense marker maps and cost-effective genotyping methods, a novel genetic improvement method, called genomic selection, has been developed and is already revolutionising the cattle breeding industry. genomic selection is a form of marker-assisted selection in which genetic markers covering the whole genome are used to estimate breeding values   <cit> . however, since most of the snps present on the whole-genome cattle snp genotyping microarrays commonly used, are not in genes and also because of the extent of linkage disequilibrium, snps associated with economically important traits, will most likely, not be involved directly in these traits. the identification of the causative genetic variants involved in the phenotypes of interest, remain a difficult task. it is therefore, crucial to develop strategies to pinpoint more rapidly causative genetic variants underlying phenotypes of interest.

the identification of these causative genetic variants, also known as quantitative trait nucleotides  involves the mapping of quantitative trait loci , the discovery of novel genetic markers in the qtl regions, the fine-mapping of qtls and then the sequencing of candidate genes. this iterative process until recently was very time-consuming, but thanks to the availability of a large number of snps and to the relatively low-cost of whole-genome genotyping methodologies, the fine-mapping of qtl regions has now been expedited. in addition, the advent of novel sequencing technologies  <cit>  offers now a new opportunity for the identification of qtns, with the ability to partially or completely re-sequence mammalian genomes, in a relatively cost-effective manner, and to identify polymorphisms responsible for the traits of interest.

the genome of animals from many species has now been sequenced, including the genomes of several bulls  <cit> . for example, eck et al.  generated the first single cattle genome sequence by a next-generation sequencing method  <cit> . by sequencing the whole-genome sequence of one fleckvieh bull, they discovered more than  <dig> million novel cattle snps. even though sequencing costs plummeting, sequencing whole-genomes or large targeted regions is still too expensive for most laboratories.

a whole-transcriptome rna sequencing  method has recently been developed to identify and quantify genes expressed in different tissues  <cit> . this method has also been used to identify polymorphisms in transcribed regions, in different species, including in cattle  <cit> . a transcriptomic-based sequencing approach offers a cheaper alternative to identify a large number of polymorphisms and possibly to discover qtns.

in the present study, we performed a gene-based snp discovery analysis in bovine longissimus thoraci, using a whole-transcriptome sequencing approach. to our knowledge, this represents the first study done in bovine muscle. for this purpose, muscle samples from three different limousin bulls were analysed. we have identified more than  <dig>  putative snps, including more than 60% novel polymorphisms. to evaluate the accuracy of the snps detected,  <dig> putative snps were genotyped. one-hundred percent concordance was observed when a stringent snp quality criterion was chosen. the rna-seq data and the collection of newly discovered coding snps improve the genomic resources available for cattle, especially for beef breeds. the large amount of variation present in genes expressed in limousin longissimus thoracis, especially the large number of non synonymous coding snps, may prove useful to study the mechanisms underlying the genetic variability of meat quality traits.

RESULTS
rna sequencing
to obtain a global view of the bovine longissimus thoracis transcriptome at single-nucleotide resolution, poly-enriched mrna from three limousin bull calves were retrotranscribed and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. the three rna-seq libraries were barcode-tagged and sequenced on one lane of an illumina hiseq <dig> sequencer. sequencing of cdna libraries generated a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw paired-end reads with a length of  <dig> bases, resulting in a total of  <dig> gigabases. the reads were de-multiplexed to assign reads to each sequenced sample according to its barcode index. approximately  <dig> to  <dig> million paired-end reads were obtained for each library. reads from each sample were then mapped back to the bovine reference transcriptome. we used the set of bos taurus ensembl transcripts v <dig> refseq genes as the reference transcriptome. this set contains transcripts for  <dig>  known or novel genes but also pseudogenes. based on mappings done using the burrows—wheeler aligner  programme, 63% to 67% of the mapped reads were aligned properly paired . transcriptome contamination was negligible . a total of  <dig>  transcripts  were identified, with at least one paired-end read in all samples analysed. similar rna-seq read mapping rate and the number of genes identified were obtained in other rna-seq bovine studies  <cit> . for example, wickramasinghe et al.  found that ~65% of the rna-seq reads they generated while sequencing the milk transcriptome mapped uniquely onto the bovine genome. they also found that ~ <dig> - <dig>  genes were expressed in milk  <cit> . baldwin and collaborators found, this time, by sequencing the rumen epithelium that ~71% of the reads mapped onto ~ <dig>  different genes  <cit> .

gene expression was normalised as paired-end reads mapped per million total uniquely mapped paired-end reads . amongst these transcripts,  <dig>   were identified with more than  <dig> read per million in at least one library. some transcripts were represented by many reads. moreover, 50% of the reads mapped to only  <dig> transcript sequences and 90% mapped to  <dig>  transcripts. the top twenty of these transcripts are shown in table  <dig>  amongst these transcripts, several are associated with energy metabolism  or locomotion . these results were consistent with the physiological role of genes expected in the surveyed tissue.

to assess the consistency of gene expression profile measurements, the pairwise individual-to-individual pearson correlation coefficient of the gene expression levels was calculated. the correlations were very high between individuals  . the shared and unique presence of transcripts is shown in figure  <dig>   <dig>   of the transcripts were shared among the three samples. however, approximately 2% of the transcripts are only expressed in one sample.

snp discovery and annotation
for snp calling, bwa was used to map the paired-reads from each sample to the bovine reference genome sequence. the sam tools package was used for snp discovery using stringent parameters . samtools can identify single base substitutions as well as small insertions and deletions; however, only snps were considered in the current analysis. in total  <dig>  different snp positions were detected with the rna-seq reads. amongst these snps,  <dig>   were homozygous in all three sequenced samples, corresponding presumably to differences between limousin and the hereford bovine whole-genome reference sequence  <cit> . a comparable number of snps were discovered by canovas et al.  using a similar total number of rna-seq reads . they identified ~ <dig>  snps located in genes expressed in milk samples from holstein cows. however, only  <dig>  snps  were polymorphic within their seven holstein cows  <cit> .

in our study, we found that there were  <dig>  bi-allelic snps mapping to coding regions,  <dig> % of which were previously found and recorded in dbsnp. this high percentage of novel snps, even though there are currently more than  <dig> millions snps in the public snp database dbsnp , suggests that a large fraction of the genetic variability present in limousin cattle still remains to be discovered.

the proportion of transition substitutions were a/g, 36%, and c/t, 37%, compared to transversions a/c, 7%, g/t, 7%, a/t, 4% and c/g, 9%. this corresponds to a transition:transversion ratio of  <dig> : <dig>  the observed transition:transversion ratio is closed to the expected ratio  if all substitutions were equally likely.

amongst these bi-allelic snps,  <dig>   were found using ensembl’s variant effect predictor in a predicted coding region.  <dig>   resulted in an amino acid change  found in  <dig>  different genes. the percentage of nonsynonymous changes in the coding region found in our study was lower compared to whole-genome  <cit>  studies performed previously in cattle. for example, kawahara-miki et al.  have reported up to  <dig> % of nscsnps in coding regions in the whole-genome of a single individual of the japanese kuchinoshima-ushi native cattle breed  <cit> . they found  <dig>  nscsnps in  <dig>  different genes. however, our results were similar to the rate found in another transcriptome-based study  <cit> . huang and collaborators  found  <dig>  nscsnps  out of  <dig>  coding snps  identified by sequencing the transcriptomes of leukocytes from three animals from three different breeds  <cit> . the broader gene coverage when sequencing dna versus rna might contribute to the discrepancy in the rate of nscsnps found between whole-genome and transcriptome-based studies.

the deleterious effect of non-synonymous snps were analysed using the sift and polyphen algorithms. in order to use these programmes, sequences flanking the bovine nscsnps were mapped onto the human genome and custom scripts were used to extract the human position orthologous to each bovine snp position. we selected only bovines nscsnps for which the two bases before and the two bases after the snp exactly matched the human sequence. the human chromosomal position and the bovine alleles were combined to produce “pseudo human” variant positions and then used to query sift and polyphen. using this conservative approach, we could retrieve the human “orthologous” position for  <dig> different bovine nscsnps.

using sift, we found that  <dig> different “pseudo human” coding variants were damaging. the three limousin animals used were homozygous or heterozygous for  <dig> and  <dig> of these damaging snps, respectively. the difference between the number of snps found homozygous and heretozygous, reflects the fact that deleterious alleles are less likely to be homozygous. all three limousin animals were homozygous for  <dig> damaging ncsnps, including  <dig> snps with a genotype probability score above  <dig>  and  <dig> snps with a genotype probability score of  <dig> .

using polyphen- <dig>  we found  <dig> different damaging “pseudo human” coding variants.  <dig> snps were homozygous and  <dig> snps heterozygous in at least one of the three limousin samples. all limousin animals were homozygous for  <dig> damaging nscsnps, including  <dig> snps with a genotype probability score above  <dig>  and  <dig> snps with a genotype probability score of  <dig> .

fifty damaging nscsnps were found by both sift and polyphen- <dig> algorithms, including  <dig> high-confidence nscsnps for which all three limousin animals are homozygous .

gene ontology analysis was performed with all genes containing nscsnps. out of the  <dig>  genes,  <dig>   were assigned to one or more go annotations. in total  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  go terms were obtained for biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions, respectively. go term analysis showed a significant enrichment of specific go terms when comparing the annotations of snp-containing genes against all unique transcripts from the bovine reference transcriptome. a summary of the classification of these genes into major biological process, cell component and molecular function categories is presented in additional file 3: table s <dig>  genes encoding proteins from the cytoskeleton and the extra-cellular matrix, or involved in cell cycle and cellular response are significantly over-represented. this finding might be explained by the high level of expression of these genes, that likely translates into greater sequence coverage and ultimately in a larger proportion of snps being identified in specific functional groups of genes. no significant enrichment in kegg terms/pathways was found.

the positions of the  <dig>  different snps predicted with the rna-seq reads were compared to the position on the umd <dig>  bovine genome assembly of know quantitative trait loci  deposited in the public database animalqtldb  <cit> .  <dig>  snps were located in  <dig>  different qtl regions . for example,  <dig>  different snps are found in  <dig> qtl regions for meat tenderness score; whereas  <dig>  snps are within  <dig> qtl regions for marbling score. qtls were sorted into two groups  and the number of snps found in these two groups were counted. we then performed a chi-squared test and found a significant difference  in the number of snps between the two groups , suggesting an enrichment of snps in meat/muscle related qtls. the high number of predicted snps located within known qtl regions, particularly in chromosomal regions harbouring qtls for meat quality-related traits, indicates that the collection of snps found in the longissimus thoraci transcriptome should allow the detection of candidate quantitative trait nucleotides responsible for the genetic variability of some of these traits.

selection of candidate snps and validation
to analyse the accuracy of rna-seq technology for snp detection, a set of snps were selected for validation by genotyping. non-synonymous snps are of particular interest because they are more likely to alter the structure and biological function of a protein, and therefore could be the causative mutations underlying important phenotypes. we therefore selected nscsnps for validation. all suitable putative bi-allelic nscsnps were evaluated with the illumina adt software.  <dig>  nscsnps  with adt score > <dig>  passed the filtering step. in order to increase the probability of an in silico detected snp being a truly polymorphic site, we selected nscsnps already found in dbsnp. finally,  <dig> putative nscsnps detected in  <dig> genes were selected .

the  <dig> selected snps were genotyped on the three original limousin bull calves used for the rna-seq work, using llumina’s goldengate beadxpress system. from the  <dig> snps that were genotyped,  <dig> snp assays failed to work , equivalent to a conversion rate of ~77%. we had 100% call rate for all remaining  <dig> snps with these three dna samples . a similarly low assay conversion rate was obtained in a recent snp genotyping project using illumina’s goldengate beadxpress system and was due to failure in the synthesis of some of the oligonucleotides .

 <dig> rs number from dbsnp.

a comparison between genotypes obtained by direct genotyping and predicted from the rna-seq data show  <dig> discrepancies  . a quick survey shows that discordant genotyping calls occur when genotypes have been predicted from the rna-seq data with a low probability . only two discrepancies  remained when rna-seq-based genotypes having at least a probability score of  <dig> were selected, and no discrepancies were observed when using the highest probability threshold . it is important to point out that the rna-seq-based genotypes were derived from cdna sequences whereas the genotypes produced by genotyping were obtained from dna samples. the two discrepancies seen after filtering with a probability score above  <dig>  could therefore possibly be true differences between rna and corresponding dna samples, due to a-to-i  rna editing  were homozygous in all three sequenced samples;  <dig>   were bi-allelic snps;  <dig>   were previously found in dbsnp;  <dig>   were found in coding regions and  <dig>   resulted in an amino acid change . a list of the high-confidence snps is available, as an additional file to this manuscript .

population genetics screens
to test the usefulness of the identified snps, the  <dig> selected nscsnps were assessed by genotyping a total of  <dig> bovine samples  representing the  <dig> major breeds used in france, an african taurine breed , and two other bovinae species .

as reported above,  <dig> snp assays failed to work in all samples. snp call rate ranged from 55%  to 100%, whereas the call rate for bovine dna samples ranged from 93% to 98%.

the majority  of the selected snps with working assays, generated data with the european bison and the greater koudou samples  . this could be expected since the markers were developed from  intra-genic regions. only  <dig> snps exhibited polymorphisms in these two outcross species . however, due to the small sample size , this number is likely to be downwardly biased and a higher proportion of snps may in fact be polymorphic and therefore prove useful in these species. as expected from the phylogenetics of these species, the proportions of working snps were lower in the greater koudou than in the european bison.

the observed allele frequencies for the all autosomal snps with a snp call rate above 92% are shown in table  <dig>  for each cattle population. all autosomal snps had a minor allele frequency  >=  <dig>  in all populations, with the exception of  <dig> snps which had a fixed allele in at least one population. the highest snp maf observed was  <dig> . the mean maf for all autosomal markers ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

the observed heterozygosities, expected heterozygosities under hwe for the observed population allele frequencies, and significance level for the test for departures from hwe for each autosomal snp, are shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  all these markers were in agreement with hwe . the mean observed heterozygosity estimated for all autosomal markers, for each population ranged from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . the mean observed heterozygosities in our populations were similar to values estimated in previous studies, including a study that used a whole-genome snp panel to characterise the genetic diversity of several french cattle breeds  <cit> .

the overall genetic differentiation among breeds was moderate  but highly significant from zero . this genetic differentiation among breeds implies that approximately 90% of the total genetic variation was explained by individual variability. a similar genetic differentiation was previously reported in a study carried out on french breeds, using microsatellite markers  <cit> .

the exact test for population differentiation based on allele frequency variations shows that all breeds tested were significantly different from each other . genetic distances between breeds were measured by pair-wise fst as shown in additional file 8: table s <dig>  the hol breed was the most differentiated one. the largest similarity was detected between bla and sal animals . these results were in agreement with a previous study that analysed the genetic relationships between bla, hol, lim and sal populations  <cit> . gautier and collaborators found in their study that hol is also the most differentiated breed; however they found that aub and lim animals shared the smallest fst   <cit> . this discrepancy with our findings might mostly be due to the lim population they surveyed. since their study included us lim animals, it is possible that these lim animals were not pure-bred animals, unlike the lim animals we used.

the degree of genetic differentiation among the breeds studied and the high levels of significance for the between-population fst estimates indicate a relatively low gene flow between these breeds.

principal component analysis was performed including all animals and all autosomal loci using allele frequencies to summarise breed relationships. the analysis indicates a clear separation between the nine populations , but also some variability within each breed . a total of approximately 69% of the variance accounted for the first three dimensions of the pca.

functional candidate mutations
the discovered coding snps, especially the  <dig>  high-confidence snps may have a direct functional effet and some of them may be involved in the genetic variability of meat quality traits.

among the high-confidence non synonymous coding snps, we have identified a single polymorphism resulting in a premature stop codon. snp rs <dig>  is located within the 10th and last exon of cd <dig>  a membrane cofactor protein. this variant leads to a three amino acid shortened protein. none of the sampled animals were homozygous for this mutation. the corresponding bovine gene  has three known different transcripts encoding  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> amino acid long proteins. the nscsnp modifies the longest bovine protein version; however, as the last three amino acids are not conserved within the bovine proteins or between species, the polymorphism is unlikely to have a functional impact.

we also found among the high-confidence nscsnps, the previously reported f94l mutation  in the growth differentiation factor  <dig> . gdf <dig> is a known muscle growth factor inhibitor commonly known as myostatin . this gene has been identified as the gene responsible for the double-muscling phenotype in cattle  <cit> . numerous mutations in mstn have been described in many breeds that cause muscle hypertrophy  <cit> , including a non synonymous amino acid substitution  in a region of the protein known to be the inhibitory domain of the mstn propeptide  <cit> . limousin cattle are not considered a double-muscled breed, however genotyping of the snp rs <dig> has shown that the a allele is present at high frequency  <cit> . interestingly, the three sampled animals were homozygous for this mutation. several studies have shown that the f94l mutation is associated with increased muscle mass, carcass yield, meat tenderness and with a reduction of collagen content in limousin and limousin-cross cattle  <cit> . the high frequency of the mutant allele in limousin most likely reflects the effects of selection for increased muscle mass.

we found among the high-confidence polymorphisms a nscsnp in another bovine gene known to be involved in meat quality traits: the mutation a127s  in the protein kinase adenosine monophosphate-activated α3-subunit . studies have shown that mutations in the porcine prkag <dig> affect the glycogen content in muscle, and consequently, ultimate ph, meat colour, water-holding capacity, drip loss, tenderness and cooking loss  <cit> . because of the association of this gene with meat quality traits, polymorphism screens in the bovine prkag <dig> have also been performed and several non synonymous snps have been identified, including snp rs <dig>  <cit> . associations between another polymorphism within prkag <dig> and meat colour traits and cooking loss have been found in cattle  <cit> . it will be therefore interesting to test the effects of snp rs <dig>  this nscsnp is located within a region of the gene highly conserved in mammals; however, it is not located within any of the cystathione βsynthetase domains, where the two mutations with the highest phenotypic effects  have been found, in pig.

in addition, we identified several polymorphisms in new candidate genes for several meat quality-related traits. for example, we found a high-confidence non synonymous coding snp  in the gene encoding the mitochondrial propionyl-coa carbolylase beta subunit , which is involved in the catabolism of propanoate, an important intermediate in the metabolism of several amino acids. yang and collaborators  <cit>  have shown that a polymorphism in pccb is associated with fat weight, in pig. interestingly, the bovine pccb gene lies within a qtl region for fat thickness at the 12th rib  <cit> . pccb could therefore be a good candidate gene for this trait.

we also found seven high-confidence nscsnps  in the gene encoding the heparin sulfate proteoglycan  <dig> . this gene encodes a large proteoglycan that is a component of the extracellular matrix. choi and collaborators  <cit>  found an association between a polymorphism within this gene and marbling score, in pig. the bovine hspg <dig> gene is located within a marbling score qtl  <cit>  and could therefore be a good candidate for this phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
our results represent the first study of gene-based snps discovered using rna-seq in bovine muscle. our results show that rna-seq is a fast and efficient method to identify snps in coding regions and we identified more than  <dig>  putative snps . more than 60% of these snps are completely novel. the high percentage of validation confirms the utility of the snp-mining process and the stringent quality criteria for distinguishing sequence variations from sequencing errors or artifacts introduced during the preparation of the cdna libraries. the rna-seq data and the collection of newly discovered coding snps improve the genomic resources available for cattle, especially for beef breeds. the large amount of variation present in genes expressed in limousin longissimus thoracis, especially the large number of non synonymous coding snps, may prove useful to study the mechanisms underlying the genetic variability of meat quality traits. the coding snps could also be used to study allele-specific gene expression.

our approach could be further improved in order to reduce the cost of snp discovery and validation. higher multiplexing of cdna libraries prior to sequencing, would reduce sequencing cost while still allowing snp discovery and genotype assignment. with continued improvements in next-generation dna sequencing technologies, throughput will increase while sequencing costs are expected to decrease. when relevant tissue samples are available, it will soon be reasonable to directly perform association studies using a genotyping rna-seq-based approach.
