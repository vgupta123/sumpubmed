BACKGROUND
many photoreceptors such as rhodopsins, phytochromes, cryptochromes and phototropins have been discovered in eukaryotic organisms by a combination of biochemical and physiological assays  <cit> , whereas prokaryotic versions of these proteins have often been identified during genome projects. phytochromes, which are photoreceptors with a bilin chromophore, control a broad range of developmental processes in plants  <cit> . the discovery of plant phytochrome in the late 1950s was the starting point for biochemical, molecular and physiological characterisations. since the late 1990s, phytochromes have also been found in many bacteria and fungi  <cit> , in most cases after the phytochrome gene has been identified during genome sequencing  <cit> . prototypical bacterial phytochromes are light-regulated histidine kinases, which trans-phosphorylate cognate response regulator proteins  <cit> . in cyanobacteria, a number of light effects such as phototaxis  <cit> , control of the circadian clock  <cit> , chromatic adaptation  <cit>  and adaptation to blue light conditions  <cit> , are controlled by proteins that contain domains with rather weak homology to the so-called gaf-domain of phytochrome. the biological function of prototypical phytochrome is known for only a few bacteria. the cyanobacterial phytochrome cph <dig> is important for adaptation to strong light conditions  <cit>  and is involved in regulating several genes, including gifa, which encodes a regulator of glutamine synthase  <cit> . however, the signal transduction link between cph <dig> and the observed light effects is still obscure and the biological role of the prototypical phytochromes in other cyanobacteria is unknown.

the most obvious effects controlled by bacterial phytochromes have been found for bradyrhizobium spp., a photosynthetic plant symbiont, and the purple bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris. in both species, the synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid pigments is under phytochrome control  <cit> .

many non-photosynthetic bacteria, including the gamma ray resistant deinococcus radiodurans, the soil bacterium agrobacterium tumefaciens and the pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa also contain phytochromes  <cit> . for d. radiodurans, it has been reported that the phytochrome bphp controls the regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> , but as in synechocystis, the signal transduction link between input and output is unknown. the biological role of phytochromes in other non-photosynthetic bacteria is unknown.

the present work concentrates on the phytochrome system of a. tumefaciens. this bacterium is known for its ability to induce plant tumours by gene transformation, a mechanism that is widely used for plant transformation  <cit> . the genome of this bacterium was sequenced by two groups in  <dig>  <cit> , the sequencing data revealed two phytochrome genes. since their discovery, both a. tumefaciens phytochromes have been analysed biochemically as recombinant proteins. these studies provided deeper insight into general phytochrome functions and phytochrome diversity  <cit> . both phytochromes are expressed in a. tumefaciens cells, as revealed by uv/vis spectroscopy  <cit> .

the computational approach presented here is aimed at identifying proteins that might share common features with bacterial phytochromes. the analysis is based on the distribution of protein homologs among bacteria according to the following concept: if proteins share common functions in one organism, they might have evolved together, with similar mutation rates, and their homologs should be abundant in similar subsets of species.

RESULTS
the principle of the investigation is outlined in figure  <dig>  in this example, six species were used for an imaginary global homology analysis. each species has between eight and ten proteins, which are abbreviated by a letter for the species and a digit. protein a <dig> of species a is the query protein of the imaginary co-distribution analysis. this protein has homologs in four other species and one homolog, a <dig>  in species a itself. in table  <dig>  which gives the result of the co-distribution analysis, the proteins of species a are sorted according to the co-distribution probability p, which is calculated as described in the methods section. proteins that have homologs in a similar subset as the query protein a <dig> are listed at the top. protein a <dig> has the best co-distribution match, with a probability of co-distribution under random conditions of p =  <dig> . a <dig> is a direct homolog of a1; this is indicated by "1" in column e. the header of table  <dig> contains further comments.

the co-distribution analyses in this study are based on protein sequences from  <dig> bacteria, listed in additional file  <dig>  the tabulated results of two global blast  <cit>  searches with e-values of  <dig>  and  <dig> were stored in files that were used to compare the homolog distribution of protein couples. two different blast analyses were undertaken in order to determine the dependence of the results on the e-value. the number of homologs usually differs according to the chosen e-value and lies within a reasonable range for the query proteins . each query protein was probed against all the other proteins of the same species to produce sorted co-distribution tables, as outlined in the example of figure  <dig> and table  <dig> .

the photosynthetic protein d <dig> from the cyanobacterium synechocystis pcc  <dig> was chosen as a control query protein to see whether the co-distribution approach identifies related proteins . in addition, five phytochromes from four different species were selected as query proteins: agp <dig>   and agp <dig>   from a. tumefaciens, bphp from p. aeruginosa , bphp from d. radiodurans  and cph <dig> from synechocystis . the agp <dig> gene of a. tumefaciens is arranged in a gene cluster as depicted in fig.  <dig>  a response regulator protein termed agr and a histidine kinase termed exsg are encoded in the same operon. it has been shown that agr is phosphorylated by agp <dig> in a light-dependent manner  <cit> . exsg is homologous to the histidine kinase module of agp <dig>  a response regulator termed exsf is encoded in the other dna strand next to the exsg gene. in prokaryotes, such an arrangement points to possible common functions among the encoded proteins. since the principal goal of this study was to gain information about the phytochrome system of a. tumefaciens, agr , exsf  and exsg  were also selected as query proteins. the response regulator of synechocystis phytochrome, rcp <dig>  which is phosphorylated by cph <dig>  <cit> , was also included .

for each query protein, the results of both global blast analyses were taken as sources for the co-distribution analyses. thus,  <dig> co-distribution lists were generated. the target proteins in these lists were sorted as outlined in table  <dig>  all co-distribution lists are presented as additional files on the bmc web server.

the blast analysis with an e-value of  <dig>  revealed d <dig> homologs in  <dig> species. these species are identical to the  <dig> cyanobacteria that were selected for global analysis. in synechocystis, there are  <dig> proteins with exactly the same distribution. among these are  <dig> other proteins with photosynthesis-related functions, such as phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, ferredoxin and photosystem subunit proteins. a green background marks the corresponding field in the co-distribution table . twenty-four of the  <dig> proteins have been annotated as "hypothetical" and  <dig> as "unknown protein". eleven proteins that are clearly not related to photosynthesis, such as ribosomal proteins or trna synthetase, also have the same distribution as d <dig>  a yellow background marks these fields in the co-distribution table.

when the d <dig> co-distribution analysis was based on a blast e-value of  <dig> , d <dig> homologs were found in  <dig> species. among these are the six cyanobacteria and one other photosynthetic bacterium, r. palustris. the other  <dig> species are non-photosynthetic. owing to the higher number of species with d <dig> homologs, the co-distribution results are more differentiated. for comparison with the previous survey, the top  <dig> proteins were inspected in more detail. since the proteins placed between positions  <dig> and  <dig> have the same distribution, it was not possible to use exactly the same number of proteins as in the previous case. among the top  <dig> proteins there are  <dig> photosynthesis-related proteins,  <dig> proteins with functions not related to photosynthesis,  <dig> "hypothetical proteins",  <dig> "unknown proteins", and  <dig> proteins for which the function could not clearly be assigned to photosynthesis. the number of photosynthesis-related proteins is comparable with the first analysis, but the selection is slightly different. for example, a ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase subunit and a carbon dioxide concentrating protein subunit are among the top  <dig> in the second analysis, whereas the same proteins are placed at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, in the first analysis.

the d <dig> analysis showed that proteins with related functions can be identified by the present approach, since among the top ca.  <dig> proteins there are three to four times more photosynthesis-related proteins than proteins with other known functions. it seems likely that among the hypothetical and unknown proteins listed at the top of the co-distribution tables, there are many other proteins with functions related to photosynthesis.

in cases where the phytochromes or phytochrome-related proteins mentioned above were chosen as query , the proteins placed within the top  <dig> in each co-distribution list were compared with all proteins from the same species. text-based searches were performed to count the number of proteins belonging to particular groups of proteins such as histidine kinases, response regulators and transcription factors. these results are summarized in table  <dig>  it is remarkable that in all cases the frequency of histidine kinases  among the top  <dig> co-distributed proteins is much higher than among all proteins of the species. for example, agp <dig> has 18% to 20% co-distributed "two-component sensors"  among the top  <dig>  whereas only  <dig> % of all a. tumefaciens proteins belong to this group. since bacterial phytochromes are also histidine kinases, the co-distribution with other histidine kinases might simply be based on direct homology, as between a <dig> and a <dig> in the example of fig.  <dig>  however, most co-distributed histidine kinases are not direct blast homologs, as indicated in column "e" of the co-distribution tables. the results for the co-distribution of  response regulators, which are substrates of histidine kinases, are qualitatively comparable with those for the histidine kinases. there are, however, two exceptions: in the agp <dig> and rcp <dig> analyses, which were based on the low e-value blast search, the frequency of response regulators among the top  <dig> in the lists was comparable with that in the entire protein population.

in the case of the a. tumefaciens query proteins, the possibility was tested that proteins designated "transcriptional regulators" are enriched within the top  <dig> in the lists. for all five query proteins , the frequency of co-distributed transcriptional regulators increases when the blast analysis e-value is changed from low to high. the latter but not the former values are above average.

the five a. tumefaciens query proteins were also tested for co-distribution among each other. table  <dig> gives the positions in the co-distribution tables for each possible combination. this table shows that agr and agp <dig> match quite well: in three out of four combinations, the target protein was among the first  <dig> in the co-distribution list. similarly, there is also a rather good match between cph <dig> and rcp <dig> of synechocystis . the putative response regulator of d. radiodurans bphp  appears at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the bphp co-distribution tables. for the combinations exsg/agp <dig>  exsf/agp <dig> and exsf/exsg, the target protein is placed among the first  <dig> in the co-distribution lists, indicating a rather high co-distribution. agp <dig> and exsg are direct blast homologs, as indicated in column "e" of the result tables. the similarity between these two proteins has been noted previously  <cit> . as mentioned above, the exsf and exsg genes are located close together . this arrangement suggests that exsf is a substrate of exsg, which in turn could explain the good match between these proteins.

besides phytochromes, a. tumefaciens contains another putative photoreceptor, a flavoprotein that belongs of the cryptochrome/photolyase group. cryptochromes and photolyases are homologous proteins that serve as photoreceptors and catalyze light-dependent dna repair mechanisms, respectively. in a. tumefaciens, the protein annotated as dna photolyase  has also been classified as cryptochrome  <cit> , but functional details are as yet unclear. in plants, the signal transduction pathways of cryptochromes and phytochromes are intertwined  <cit> . for the plant arabidopsis thaliana it has been reported that a cryptochrome interacts directly with a phytochrome  <cit> . for these reasons, the co-distribution of phytochromes and cryptochromes/photolyases was of particular interest. in a. tumefaciens, there is a good match between agp <dig> as query and the dna photolyase  as target; the latter is placed at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the co-distribution tables . there is no significant co-distribution between agp <dig> and cryptochrome/photolyase . in synechocystis and p. aeruginosa, the co-distribution between phytochromes and cryptochromes/photolyases is rather poor , and in d. radiodurans, cryptochromes/photolyases seem to be absent .

the agp <dig> lists were inspected for further candidates that might share common functions with this phytochrome. one striking observation was that either two or three glutamate synthase large subunits are among the first  <dig> proteins in the co-distribution tables . there are three large and one small subunits of this enzyme in a. tumefaciens. with agp <dig> as query, none of the glutamate synthase subunits appeared among the first proteins in the co-distribution table . however, in the case of d. radiodurans, synechocystis and p. aeruginosa phytochromes, cross-correlation with glutamate synthase subunits is also obvious . in both synechocystis cph <dig> tables, two ferredoxin-dependent glutamate synthases are found among the top 60; in the d. radiodurans tables, the large subunit of glutamate synthase is placed among the top 50; and in the p. aeruginosa tables, the large subunit is found at positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

another enzyme of amino acid metabolism, methionine synthase, is also located at the top of the agp <dig> lists, namely at positions  <dig> and  <dig> . again, there is no significant co-distribution between agp <dig> and this protein , but with the other phytochromes  the co-distribution is in the range of glutamate synthase .

discussion
for a given target protein, the co-distribution table shows which proteins have similar or equal blast-homolog distributions among a set of species. these tables can be used to test for the co-distribution of protein couples with known functions or to find protein partners with a yet unknown mutuality, given that the relationship has led to co-evolution of these proteins. when the photosynthetic protein d <dig> was chosen as query protein, many other photosynthesis-related proteins appeared among the first ca.  <dig> proteins of the co-distribution tables. the ratio between these proteins and those that are not related to photosynthesis is > 3: <dig>  this result implies that the chances of finding protein couples with related functions by the method presented here are rather high.

two classes of proteins are known to act together with bacterial phytochromes: response regulators, which are trans-phosphorylated by the phytochrome histidine kinase subunit, and heme oxygenases, the enzymes that catalyse the last or the second last step in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis. depending on the species, genes for either protein may be found next to the phytochrome genes  <cit> . heme oxygenases appear in rather low positions in all the phytochrome co-distribution tables. a co-evolutionary relationship between these proteins is thus not supported by the present study. phylogenetic analyses imply that cyanobacterial heme oxygenases are of different origin from proteobacterial homologs, whereas bacterial phytochromes seem to share one common origin  <cit> . this might explain the rather large distance between the two proteins in the co-distribution analysis. the co-distribution between agp <dig> /cph <dig>  and their cognate response regulators is in general rather good. in the phytochrome co-distribution tables, other response regulators are found higher in the list. an unambiguous identification of the cognate response regulator by the present approach is thus not expected. however, this approach could reduce the number of proteins to be analysed for those species where the response regulator is yet to be identified. in p. aeruginosa, the cognate phytochrome response regulator cannot be deduced from the gene arrangement. according to the list of p. aeruginosa proteins, there are  <dig> response regulators in this species; an initial biochemical screen could focus on those placed at the tops of the co-distribution lists.

the rather high frequency of histidine kinases and response regulators among those proteins listed at the tops of the phytochrome co-distribution tables suggests that bacterial phytochromes and other histidine kinases act together in a complex intracellular network. the common model of two-component signalling predicts that histidine kinases act as homodimers and that they specifically transfer phosphate to one cognate response regulator  <cit> . however, more complex interactions might exist in the natural host.  two different histidine kinase monomers could form heterodimers. for the plant a. thaliana it has been shown that four of the five phytochromes can form heterodimers, most likely by their histidine-kinase-like subunits  <cit> .  different response regulators might function as substrates of the histidine kinase.  the downstream signalling pathways of different input histidine kinases could merge. for signal transduction in which bacterial phytochromes are involved, none of these possibilities has yet been tested.

in addition to proteins with regulatory functions, the enzyme glutamate synthase is of particular interest. in a. tumefaciens, there are three large and one small glutamate synthase subunits. depending on the e-value of the global blast analysis, either two or three of these proteins were among the top  <dig> in the co-distribution tables. with the exception of agp <dig>  all other phytochromes in the present study have co-distributed glutamate synthases. at least one glutamate synthase  is placed among the top  <dig> in the co-distribution lists. in the cyanobacterium synechocystis, the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme matches better with the phytochrome cph <dig> query protein than the nadh-dependent enzyme. in plants, where phytochrome action has been analysed over decades, there are also ferredoxin-dependent and nadh-dependent glutamate synthases. the ferredoxin-dependent enzyme is located in the plastid, where it acts together with glutamine synthase to incorporate ammonium  into glutamine and glutamate. ammonium is formed from nitrite  by nitrite reductase, which like glutamate synthase is directly coupled to the photosynthetic electron cascade in the chloroplast via ferredoxin. the expression of all three enzymes and the cytosolic nitrate reductase, which catalyses the conversion of nitrate into nitrite, is light-regulated by phytochrome  <cit> .

in cyanobacteria, enzymes of ammonium assimilation seem to be regulated by ammonium, but not by light  <cit> . light control of gene transcription was analysed by rna profiling in wild type and cph <dig> and cph <dig> mutants of synechocystis  <cit> . in these studies, no influence of cph <dig> on the abundance of glutamate synthase mrna was found . however, the expression of gifa, a regulatory protein of glutamine synthase, which acts in cooperation with glutamate synthase in the "gogat cycle", seems be under the control of cph <dig> and cph <dig>  as deduced from expression profiling results on the double mutant  <cit> . it could therefore be that the gogat cycle is indirectly under the control of phytochromes in synechocystis.

the present data imply that bacterial phytochromes might contribute to the regulation of glutamate synthase in other prokaryotic species as well. the fact that phytochrome homologs and glutamate synthase homologs are found in similar sub-sets of species points to a common and ancient link between these two groups of proteins.

how can these proteins be connected? glutamate is a key molecule of nitrogen metabolism. glutamate and glutamine are the first amino acids in which ammonium is fixed into organic matter. glutamate serves as nitrogen source and in most species also as a carbon source for porphyrins. in the "trna pathway", realized in the majority of bacteria and plants, glutamate-trna is used as substrate for the synthesis of δ aminolevulinic acid, which is the key molecule in porphyrin synthesis. in α proteobacteria , yeast and mammals, δ aminolevulinic acid is formed from glycine and succinate  <cit> . in this case, their porphyrins obtain only the amino group of glutamate, which is transferred to serine, the substrate of glycine synthesis  <cit> . owing to their extended π-electron systems, porphyrins absorb visible light, predominantly in the longer wavelength regions. the biological functions of many porphyrins, for example chlorophylls in photosynthetic organisms, are directly related to light absorption; other porphyrins such as heme are involved in electron transport or redox reactions. light absorbed by free porphyrins, leading to photosensitization, can have damaging effects by generating reactive oxygen species. thus, the synthesis of porphyrins by light-exposed cells must be tightly regulated. not only photosynthetic organisms but also other organisms that are exposed to sunlight might benefit from light regulation of porphyrin synthesis. the histidine kinase activity of bacterial phytochromes depends on light and the presence of the bilin chromophore. therefore, phytochromes may also be regarded as sensors for the end product of porphyrin biosynthesis. it therefore seems plausible that phytochromes might have evolved as regulators of porphyrin synthesis.

a possible connection between phytochrome and methionine synthase is less evident. a literature survey gave no indication of phytochrome-mediated regulation of methionine synthase expression. if glutamate synthase catalyses an early step in the amino acid metabolism network, methionine synthase catalyses a late step  <cit> . methionine, like glutamate, serves as substrate for other enzymatic reactions besides protein synthesis: the activated form, s-adenosylmethionine, is used for methylation reactions including dna  <cit>  and protein methylation, and for the synthesis of the gaseous hormone ethylene in land plants  <cit> . methionine synthase is also important for regenerating methionine from s-adenosyl-homocysteine, the breakdown product of the methylation reaction. it could be that dna methylation protects dna from uv damage  <cit>  and that the turnover of methionine is therefore higher in the light than in the dark. in this way, phytochrome could have come into play.

although such scenarios on co-evolution are speculative, the present co-distribution data might help to gain a better understanding of phytochrome function in bacteria. the co-distribution lists contain other proteins besides those discussed in this article that might share common functions with phytochromes. in combination with genome, proteome and mutant studies, the method presented here can give clues to the evolution of signal transduction, metabolism and other cellular functions. in the present approach, only one digit was used to express protein homology . this decision was based on the e-values of the blast analyses. co-distribution analyses based on graded information about protein homology might give even more precise results. in addition, information about the length and position of homologous sequences could be included. blast is a heuristic algorithm, designed for fast database searches. if the number of protein sequences is not too great, accurate methods for sequence comparison can also be chosen  <cit> . the time required for the global blast analyses was approximately  <dig> weeks on a standard desktop computer with  <dig> gbyte ram. with faster machines, is seems realistic to test each possible combination of two protein sequences in a database containing  <dig> sequences by non-heuristic alignment algorithms.

CONCLUSIONS
the co-distribution analysis has allowed a deeper insight to be gained into possible evolutionary relationships. controls with d <dig> as query protein show that the method identifies other proteins with related functions. the present studies have allowed the possible relationships between bacterial phytochromes and other specific proteins, such as response regulators and histidine kinases, to be tested. with glutamate synthase, a protein was identified that might be evolutionarily linked to agrobacterium phytochrome agp <dig> and phytochromes of other species. the method presented thus helps to guide the design of molecular studies.
