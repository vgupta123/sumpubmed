BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions are essential to most biological processes, for example, signal transduction, hormone-receptor binding and immunological recognition. these processes comprise complex cellular protein interaction networks that are becoming increasingly accessible in the post-genome era of high-throughput proteomics. experimental methods such as mass spectrometry, phage display and yeast two hybrid have been developed to quickly identify interactions between proteins in various organisms  <cit> . concurrently, computational approaches exploiting amino acid properties, genomic and evolutionary information  <cit>  have been proposed to determine whether proteins interact or not . while both large scale experimental and computational methods are known to produce many false positive and false negative predictions, the combination of using several methods may provide more reliable results. the idea of using consensus results is not new and has been used in the meta-servers for structure prediction, generating consensus models according to the results of several prediction servers  <cit> . here we provide a new approach to the computational prediction of interacting protein-protein binding sites which can contribute to this greater accuracy  <cit> .

thanks, in large part, to the availability of increasing sequence and structural information, various computational methods have been proposed to identify putative protein-protein binding sites utilizing evolutionary relationships  <cit> , properties of surface patches  <cit> , residue hydrophobicity  <cit> , etc. recently, machine learning approaches such as neural networks  <cit> , support vector machines  <cit>  and bayesian network  <cit>  have been used to distinguish interface residues from non-interface residues based on sequence and structural properties.

all of these methods locate binding sites from protein surfaces, but none of them provide information about their binding partners . therefore, methods that identify interacting protein binding sites are necessary. inherently these methods would then allow more reliable determination of binary interactions. docking approaches provide this information by predicting the binary complex of two known structures based on energetic or geometric complementary  <cit> . however, long computation time is often required to determine each putative complex and most docking approaches are limited to rigid protein model analysis. homology modeling  <cit>  and multimeric threading  <cit>  build an atomic model of a complex based on a template structure using sequence alignments. these two methods have been tested on large scale data sets  <cit> . they both rely on the limited number of structure templates of complexes  <cit>  and usually require sequence identity above 30% between homologs  <cit> . aytuna et al.  <cit>  predicted protein-protein complexes by seeking pairs of proteins that share structurally and evolutionarily conserved residue similarity to  <dig> template interfaces. pazos et al.  <cit>  utilized correlated mutation for determining pairs of proteins that are likely to bind and also identified binding sites concurrently. although structural information is not required for this method, a large set of multiple sequence alignment for each possible pair of proteins is needed.

in this study, we introduced a new method to determine whether two binding sites interact by using machine learning techniques. a support vector machine was trained on a data set designed to capture the underlying principles of complementary information across protein interfaces. by testing on a non-redundant data set composed of  <dig> homo-dimer and  <dig> hetero-dimer structures taken from the protein data bank , we showed that our method successfully identifies interacting binding sites on a large scale without the constraint of using structure templates. we subsequently built a high-throughput pipeline combining this method with a modified version of our previously developed method that identifies the location of binding sites. as shown in figure  <dig>  the putative binding sites of two proteins are first located from the protein surfaces and then it is determined if they interact with each other. with this pipeline, we are able to identify both binding sites and binding partners simultaneously.

RESULTS
the contact preferences of interface residues
a data set consisting of  <dig> homo-dimers and  <dig> hetero-dimers with sequence identity below 30% was compiled from the pdb  <cit> . to understand the contact preferences of interface residues, statistical analysis was performed on the  <dig> contacting interface residue pairs derived from the data set. figure  <dig> plots the preferences of these contacts formed in homo-dimers and hetero-dimers with respect to the distributions of interface residues. the contact preference was the ratio of the observed contact frequency over the expected contact frequency . some commonality was observed for these two types of interfaces. as expect, and consistent with previous studies  <cit> , the contacts between positively and negatively charged residues were favored and those between residues with the same charge were underrepresented. in addition, there was a relatively high tendency for the interactions between hydrophobic residues. bogan et al.  <cit>  has reported that, using alanine-scanning mutational analysis of protein interfaces, aromatic residues tryptophan and tyrosine are the two most common amino acids in interface hot spots. in our data set, aromatic residues  were also found to participate in highly preferred contacts. some preferred associations reported by previous studies, such as contacts between tryptophan and proline, between phenylalanine and isoleucine, were also observed  <cit> .

ofran et al. have reported significant differences in residue composition and contact preferences between interfaces of hetero-obligomers, hetero-complexes, homo-obligomes, and homo-complexes  <cit> . in our data set, some differences between homo-dimer and hetero-dimer interfaces have also been observed. there was a higher tendency for hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions in homo-dimers. on the other hand, more salt bridges and fewer contacts between residues with the same charge were preferred in hetero-dimers.

several previous studies have provided detailed analysis of interaction preferences of different types of protein-protein interfaces in terms of amino acid, secondary structure or other properties  <cit> . the results of those previous studies and our studies show some variations because of the different composition of data sets and the definition of the interface residues. nevertheless, the survey presented here indicates that information from sequence profile, secondary structure and accessible surface area  may be useful discriminators for defining contacting interface residues and can be captured by svm predictors.

identification of interacting binding sites using support vector machines
it has been reported that proteins and their interaction partners have undergone compensating mutations to maintain interaction specificity  <cit> . changes of sequence signatures in one partner's binding surface are complemented by an appropriate change in sequence signatures of its interaction partner  <cit> . structural complementarity between associating interfaces has also been observed by previous researchers  <cit> . in this study, a support vector machine  was trained to predict whether two binding site interact with each other using the sequence and structural information extracted from the dimer interfaces. thus the svm should capture signal associated with compensatory mutations. the machine was trained with different combinations of sequence profile, secondary structure and asa for residues in contact across interacting binding sites  and non-contacting residues across non-interacting binding sites  . the input features of the spatially neighboring residues of the interacting and non-interacting residues were also entered into the svm. once training had completed the machine was ready to be used for actual testing. the testing methodology worked as follows : two binding sites were predicted to interact if the number of predicted contacting residue pairs reached a certain threshold. this threshold value was derived from the percentage of the total possible residue pairs between them .

prediction performances
we first performed 2-fold cross validation on known interacting binding sites derived from crystal structure complexes in our data set using sequence profile data as the only input feature. the data set was randomly separated into two subgroups with an equal number of dimers. two training and testing processes were performed. for each run, while one subgroup was used as the training set, the other subgroup was used as the test set. as presented by areas under the roc curves in figure  <dig>  by increasing the surface patch size from  <dig> to  <dig> , the prediction performance improved significantly. however, by further expanding the patch size to  <dig> , no additional improvement was observed. furthermore, to investigate if the evolutionary information provided by homologous sequences is necessary, we carried out a trial input with only sequence information instead of sequence profile information. as shown in figure  <dig>  without using this evolutionary information, the prediction performance deteriorated significantly.

we then evaluated the prediction method exploiting structural information. at a surface patch size of  <dig> ), incorporating information of secondary structure with the sequence profile increased the prediction accuracy significantly. however, further incorporation of information on the accessible surface area did not result in any additional improvement. as we increased the patch size to  <dig> ), we noticed that secondary structure and asa had no impact on prediction. therefore, for this study, we chose a sequence profile with a patch size  <dig> as the default input features.

 <dig> the mixed data set of homo-dimer and hetero-dimer interfaces.

 <dig> the data set of homo-dimer and hetero-dimer interfaces were separately trained and tested.

the prediction was performed using the default input features .

the surface patch used here included only the two nearest surface residues, which are very likely to be located in the same sequence segment. for this reason we further performed a trial using the sequence profile with a window size  <dig> in sequence . as expected, the roc curves in figure  <dig> indicates that the predictor using sequence information only was able to perform similarly to the predictor using a patch size of  <dig>  at a threshold of 56%,  <dig> % of interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of non-interacting binding sites were correctly assigned. when the average accuracy reached its maximum ,  <dig> % of interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of non-interacting binding sites were correctly assigned.

the data set comprised  <dig> homo-dimers and  <dig> hetero-dimers. using our default predictor, when the accuracy reached its maximum , up to  <dig> % of the homo-dimers were correctly predicted while only  <dig> % of the hetero-dimers were identified. is this phenomenon attributed to the difference of residue contact preferences between homo-dimer and hetero-dimer interfaces? to answer this question, we trained and tested these two types of interfaces separately. the results showed that homo-dimers were more accurately predicted than hetero-dimers . to evaluate whether this was caused by the larger amount on data available for homo-dimers,  <dig> homo-dimers were randomly selected and  <dig> fold cross validation was performed on this subset. even based on equal data size, homo-dimer interfaces were still significantly better predicted than hetero-dimer interfaces. when we compared the prediction accuracy of homo-dimers of various data set sizes, we found that the larger data set with  <dig> homo-dimers outperformed the smaller data set of  <dig> homo-dimers . on the other hand, to improve the prediction for hetero-dimer by using larger training data, we performed  <dig> fold cross validation on hetero-dimers. the data set was randomly divided into  <dig> subgroups. for each run,  <dig> subgroups were combined as the training set and the other subgroup was used as the test set. the resulting prediction was better than using  <dig> fold cross validation . in summary, our method correctly predicted  <dig> % of interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of non-interacting binding sites for homo-dimers and  <dig> % of interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of non-interacting binding sites for hetero-dimers . in the future, better predictions, especially for hetero-dimers, is expected as more training data become available.

in this study, two binding sites were predicted to interact with each other if >56% of the total possible residue pairs between them were predicted to be in contact with each other. raising the threshold increases the precision but decreases the recall  and vice versa. in the data set, the contacting residue pairs for two interacting binding sites constituted, on average, only approximately 8% of the total possible residue pairs. therefore, the threshold  selected above seem to be very high. however, when we considered the  <dig> spatially nearest residues of each any two contacting residues to be in contact with each other across the interface, the fraction of contacting residue pairs out of the total possible residue pairs increased to 47%.

predictions on putative binding sites
a pipeline was built to test if two putative binding sites would interact with each other . given two proteins a and b, the pipeline first identifies the putative binding site of each protein  and then identifies the interaction between the two putative binding sites . this pipeline is able to provide information on both the location of binding sites and their binding partners.

putative binding sites of individual components of each complex in our data set were determined by a method modified from our previous work, using sequence and structural information  <cit>  . with this method, the recall was  <dig> % and the precision was  <dig> % at the residue level. the results are summarized as follows:  <dig> % of the binding sites were precisely predicted,  <dig> % of the binding sites were correctly predicted and  <dig> % of the binding sites were partially covered by the predicted residues. if at least 70% of the residues at a site were identified, we defined this to be precisely predicted. if at least 50% of the residues at a site were identified, we considered this to be correctly predicted.

the interactions of these putative binding sites were further tested using our method . although we used putative binding sites instead of known binding sites, the prediction performance only dropped slightly . at a threshold of 56%, the predictor identified  <dig> % of interacting binding sites and  <dig> % non-interacting binding sites.

it is expected that if the putative binding sites are accurately predicted and hence identical to the known binding sites, the resulting prediction of the interaction will be the accurate. however, in most cases, the binding sites are not completely identified, so why were the predicted interactions so good? the following examples might help to explain why the results based on putative binding sites were very close to those based on known binding sites. for rad <dig> abc-atpase  <cit> , most of the interface residues between the n-terminal and c-terminal segments involve high scoring contacts predicted by predictor ii ). figure  <dig> illustrated the prediction based on putative binding sites. although the interface between the n-terminal and c-terminal segments was only partially identified by predictor i, there were still enough high scoring contacting residues at these putative sites identified by predictor ii that allowed us to determine the association between these two segments.

the interaction between actin and gelsolin g4–g <dig> domains  <cit>  is presented in figure  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  predictor i only identified the interface between the g <dig> domain and actin. however, the high scoring residues identified by predictor ii across this interface were sufficient to determine the binding between these two molecules. the falsely predicted binding site in the g <dig> domain assigned by predictor i caused predictor ii to make some erroneous predictions of high scoring contacting residues in this region. this might arise since the fact that both g <dig> and g <dig> domains belong to the gelsolin repeat family, so that the false positives on the helix of the g <dig> domain were predicted to contact actin via the site interacting with the g <dig> domain.

the pipeline consists of binding site identification  and subsequent prediction of whether two of these identified sites interact . since predictor ii depends little on spatially neighboring residues and is mostly sequence dependant, a sequence only predictor i could be substituted  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a new method to predict interacting protein binding sites using a machine learning technique. to the best of our knowledge, this method is the first trial that predicts interacting binding sites without the constraint of using structure templates. an svm was trained to learn the complementary information across interfaces and has been tested on a data set consisting of  <dig> non-redundant homo-dimer and  <dig> hetero-dimer interfaces. our predictor successfully identified  <dig> % of the interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of the non-interacting binding sites. separate training and testing on homo-dimers and hetero-dimers showed different prediction results, which might be caused by the differences in residue contact preferences between these two types of interfaces. for homo-dimers,  <dig> % of the interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of the non-interacting binding sites were correctly identified. for hetero-dimers,  <dig> % of the interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of the non-interacting binding sites were correctly identified. better predictions are expected as more structures are determined and the number of homo-dimer and hetero-dimer complexes upon which to train increases.

we built a pipeline combining the method discussed here to a modified version of our previously developed method that identifies the location of binding sites. taking both predictors together we showed that the prediction accuracy that were based on putative binding sites only decreased slightly over accurately known sites. thus the pipeline enables the simultaneous prediction of binding sites and binding partners, identifying  <dig> % of the interacting binding sites and  <dig> % of the non-interacting binding sites in our data set. in the future, the pipeline can be used to search new protein binding sites and interactions in various biological systems, and therefore build interaction networks based on interaction details between proteins. it can also be used to validate existing networks.

at this time it is difficult to compare the results presented here with those of other methods since each uses different training sets and there is a lack of a common test set  <cit> . in addition, most existing methods have not been tested on negative data and hence prediction statistics  were not provided. nevertheless, different methods have different limitations and exploit different information to various extents. for example, most docking procedures are computational expensive, homology modeling and multimeric threading rely on the availability of complex structure templates and correlated mutation methods need a large set of sequence alignment for each possible protein pair. current efforts are directed at attaining higher prediction accuracy through incorporation of additional information such as local interface geometry or water mediated interactions into our predictor.
