BACKGROUND
vntr  composites are non-autonomous, non-ltr retrotransposons specific to hominoid primates. the group comprises sva   <cit> , lava   <cit> , pva   <cit>  and fva    <cit> . whereas sva elements are found in all hominoids  <cit> , lava, pva and fva are restricted to gibbons  <cit> . all four families share the 5’ ct-hexameric repeat/alu-like region and the central vntr domain . sva  <cit> , as well as lava, pva and fva  <cit>  are mobilized by the autonomous non-ltr retrotransposon line- <dig>  in trans. the hexameric repeat/alu-like 5‘ region constitutes the minimal active human sva  <cit> . the sequence and derived structure of this domain has also been shown to influence mobilization efficiency of pva and fva  <cit> . by definition the 5’ hexameric repeat region of svas and related non-ltr retrotransposons is a vntr. to clearly distinguish it from the central domain of the elements we will, however, refer to it as ct- or hexameric repeats throughout this article.figure  <dig> vntr composite retrotransposon families in hominoid primates. all families share the 5’ ct repeat/alu-like region and the central vntr, but are characterized by variant 3’ ends. in sva the 3’ part is composed of a sequence derived from the human endogenous retrovirus herv-k . the 3’ part of lava elements  is constituted of fragments of an alusz  and of an l1me  element combined with unique  sequences preceding the alu moiety and separating it from the l1me fragment. it is also referred to as u1-alusz-u2-l1me  <cit> . pva elements are characterized by fusion of ptgr <dig> exon  <dig> and part of intron  <dig> to the vntr. the fva 3’ end contains part of a fram  element surrounded by non-repetitive sequence. chevron arrows indicate target site duplications.



the central vntr domain of svas is comprised of  <dig> to 50 bp gc-rich repeats  <cit> . the vntr of the evolutionary younger human sva subfamilies has been shown to be composed of two distinct parts   <cit> . complete deletion of the vntr in the context of a human sva resulted in a significant reduction in trans mobilization rates, whereas partial deletion led to an increase in retrotransposition  <cit> . recently, the sva vntr has been identified as the “prime interaction site of znf91” – a zinc finger protein that mediates transcriptional repression  <cit> .

involvement in transcriptional regulation has been demonstrated for a number of different vntrs in the human genome. activity of the monoamine oxidase a promoter, for example, is affected by two vntrs in a repeat number dependent manner  <cit> . similar effects have been reported for the serotonin transporter gene vntrs located upstream of the gene  <cit>  and in the second intron  <cit> , and a vntr in the promoter of the thiopurine methyltransferase gene  <cit> . polymorphism in the vntr found in the 3’utr of the dopamine transporter gene appears to influence gene expression at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> .

in the process of cloning lava and sva elements for functional studies we noticed that  the lava_e element found to be inactive in our trans-mobilization assays displayed a particular repeat unit structure at the vntr 5’ end, which was not shared by any of the other vntr composites cloned and analyzed, and  in contrast to sva the lava vntrs represented nearly perfect eagi repeats. these findings could possibly serve to explain the inactivity of the lava_e element and the incompatibility of sva and lava in the context of chimeras  <cit> , respectively. therefore, we analyzed a small sample set to investigate whether the above observations were valid across a larger number of elements. as this was found to be the case, we initiated a more comprehensive and detailed analysis across all families/subfamilies of vntr composites in all hominoids except gorilla.

here we report that vntr repeat units have evolved over time, creating subsets specific for particular subfamilies of sva and lava. we show that the vntrs of the evolutionary younger human and chimpanzee sva subfamilies are composed of highly organized repeat unit arrays. a similar tendency can be observed in the younger orangutan sva subfamilies. in lava at most five repeat units are conserved at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the domain, respectively. comparison of orthologous sva_d elements in human and chimpanzee reveals a microhomology-driven mechanism mediating vntr remodelling at the dna level. finally, we provide evidence that key determinants of lava mobilization are localized in the vntr region.

vntr repeat units – variety and evolution
to establish the nature of the ancestral set of repeat units , we investigated the repeat unit composition of sva <dig> elements  <cit>  in macaca mulatta and nomascus leucogenys. sva <dig> elements are the common ancestor of all vntr composites.

the analysis of  <dig> elements retrieved for each of the species revealed that there are two dominant repeat units of  <dig> and 39 bp, respectively. in view of creating an “ru code” for vntr composites we designated these ancestral rus a  and b , respectively. in addition to a and b, a number of longer as well as shorter rus were found in sva <dig> elements. none of them, however, could be identified in more than one or two elements. the subsequent analysis of the vntr regions of lava and sva subfamilies as well as of pva and fva identified an additional  <dig> repeat unit types. these were encoded c to s. figure  <dig> illustrates the derivation of these from the basic ru types a and b as well as from each other. for ru type s, which is found in chimpanzee vntrs only, it cannot be determined precisely from which other ru it has been derived. sequence evolution is evident within some of the ru types across vntr composite families/subfamilies. alignments for b-type rus are shown in figure  <dig>  the remaining alignments for human sva and gibbon lava can be found in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  sequence variants of rus are denoted with either prime  or superscripts. in case of the younger sva subfamilies in humans, chimpanzees and orangutans the sequence of the rus found at particular positions is conserved . the position – specific consensus sequences for these rus are provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig> figure  <dig> vntr repeat unit  types found in sva and lava, their derivation from the basic ru types and from each other.  ru types shared between sva and lava.  sva specific ru types.  lava specific ru types. indels are highlighted in grey. nucleotides differing between consensus sequences of ru types are non-bold and underlined.



the vntrs of human and chimpanzee svas are highly organized arrays of repeat units
following the identification of the basic repeat units we next wanted to know whether they are distributed randomly over the entire length of the vntr or whether there are specific patterns to be observed. analysis of ten elements each derived from the human sva subfamilies a to f revealed that the arrangement of the vntr subunits is non-random . a specific pattern at the 5’ end is evident in all six subfamilies. notably, the 5’ end is always formed by an a-type repeat unit. this, apart from a small lava subfamily , holds true for all vntr composites . figure 4a shows the ru arrays found in the six human sva subfamilies along a network generated using the sva sine-r part  <cit> . the 5’ abca array is found in elements of all six subfamilies. interestingly, d-type repeat units – otherwise specific to lava vntrs  – are occasionally found in sva_a elements . the transition of sva_a to sva_b is characterized by the emergence of the longer rus e , g , h  and i . rus e, h and i are no longer found from sva_d onwards . based on sequence analysis  we assume that they represent intermediates giving rise to the f, k and l repeat units characteristic for the younger subfamilies sva_d, sva_e and sva_f. at the 5’ end the recognizable subfamily specific array expands from abca in sva_a to abcaaab’cacaaf in sva_f. at the vntr 3’ end the terminal repeat unit t is preceded by a c-type repeat in sva_b and sva_c. the younger subfamilies sva_d to sva_f display the array kgc’t. whereas there is no clearly defined interior vntr structure to be observed in sva_a to sva_c, the central part of sva_d to sva_f vntrs is composed exclusively of well-defined kngc’ arrays. the same arrays are found in the sva_d-derived chimpanzee specific sva_pta subfamily. in sva_e ll’gc’/c” arrays are found in addition .figure  <dig> evolution of repeat unit arrays in human, chimpanzee and orangutan sva subfamilies.  the consensus repeat unit  arrays for each of the subfamilies are superimposed on a network based on alignment of the consensus sequences of the subfamilies’ sine-r domains . network branches are not drawn to scale with respect to the evolutionary distance. for reasons of clarity only the evolutionary youngest orangutan subfamilies are shown.  repeat unit schemata for the ten sva_e elements analyzed. conserved arrays at the 5’ and 3’ ends are highlighted in grey; internal arrays are boxed. k’ denotes a k-type ru with a slightly divergent sequence that is always found at the 5’ end of the arrays.



lineage specific evolution of orangutan sva vntrs is governed by a principle similar to that in the human/chimpanzee lineage
up to date, orangutan svas have been categorized as belonging to subfamilies sva_a and sva_b. qpcr analysis yielded an estimate of less than  <dig> sva elements in the orangutan genome  <cit> . sequence analysis of the orangutan genome identified around “ <dig> new insertions”  <cit>  – indicating lineage-specific amplification. recently it has been hypothesized that the acquisition of additional zinc fingers by the transcriptional repressor znf <dig> may have driven the evolution of new and different sva subfamilies in the gorilla/chimpanzee/human lineage. in orangutan, “which diverged before znf <dig> had undergone these structural changes” such a pattern  is not observed  <cit> . we now provide evidence that new sva subtypes did develop in the orangutan lineage. analysis of the sine-r moiety of  <dig> orangutan sva elements  readily identified  <dig> subfamilies. only  <dig> of the elements could be categorized as sva_a. sva_b elements are absent from the orangutan genome. the consensus sequences of the orangutan sva subfamilies and a network illustrating their phylogenetic relationships are provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  analysis of the repeat unit content of the orangutan elements identified two orangutan specific ru types : the 43 bp q-type ru that has developed concomitantly with major sequence changes in the sine-r in the transition from svapa_ <dig>  to svapa_ <dig> and the 38 bp r-type ru specific to the younger subfamilies svapa_7- <dig> . unfortunately, the analysis of the vntr domain of orangutan svas is severely hampered by assembly gaps. especially in the younger subfamilies the complete vntr structure could be determined only for small numbers of elements. nevertheless, our analysis revealed a pattern of vntr evolution that appears to be guided by the same basic principles as in the gorilla/chimpanzee/human lineage: recognizable extended 5’ ru arrays are followed by repeated arrays in the central part of the vntr domain in the younger subfamilies. by contrast to human sva_d to sva_f, the subfamily-specific vntr 3’ arrays are not identical to the expanding internal arrays in orangutan svas. another notable difference to human svas are the ru types present in the central expanding arrays: whereas in sva_d to sva_f these arrays are dominated by the 49 bp g-rich k-type rus, orangutan central arrays are characterized by amplification of c-type rus “scaffolded” by q-type rus .

lava vntrs display conserved ru arrays only at their 5’ and 3’ ends
by comparison to sva, lava elements are characterized by a smaller set of ru types. in addition to a-, b- and c-type rus that are found in sva as well, a second 40 bp ru, d , is present in almost all lava subfamilies. as in all other vntr composites the 5’ ru is always a-type, with the exception of lava_b2b . it is worthwhile noticing that in lava vntrs the sequence of the 5’ a-type ru differs from that of internal a-type rus . specific sequence variants of the ru types are found in a number of subfamilies .

evolutionary analysis of lava vntrs was carried out based on a network of subfamilies obtained through manual sorting of their 3’ end  sequences . on the main network path from lava_a to lava_f  six major “events” are to be observed :  the emergence of the d-type ru in the transition from lava_a to b1a;  the emergence of a slightly variant c-type ru  as sub-terminal ru starting with b1a;  the loss of a as internal repeat unit on the paths leading from b1l to b1f and from b1l to c <dig>  respectively ;  the emergence of n as second ru at the vntr 5’ end in the transition from b1l to c1;  the emergence of a second sub-terminal c-type repeat variant  on the paths leading from c <dig> to c <dig> and d, respectively, and  the emergence of ru types o and p as part of the terminal ru array on the path from c <dig> to e with concomitant loss of the ct sub-terminal ru variant.

the b <dig> branch of the lava network is characterized by a shared slightly divergent b-type ru  at the second position. two of the smaller, well-defined subfamilies  can be distinguished based on the presence of a c-type ru at the 5’ end  and a subfamily specific internal b-type ru , respectively.

overall, and in contrast to human svas, at most five rus appear to be conserved across elements of the same subfamily at both the 5’ and 3’ ends. specific patterns of organization of the vntr internal part could not be observed – not even in the evolutionary youngest subfamilies lava_e and lava_f.

interestingly, in subfamilies c <dig>  c <dig> and e elements displaying different structures at the vntr 5’ end are found . whereas in c <dig> the two variants – either possessing or lacking the n-type 53 bp repeat unit at the second position – are represented equally among the elements amenable to analysis, the variant lacking the n-type ru is under-represented in c <dig> and e . however, both these subfamilies gave rise to others  lacking the n-type ru. the source elements for further evolution towards c <dig> and f, respectively, can therefore be assumed to have been present in the minority fraction of their parental subfamilies.

no organized repeat unit arrays could be identified in svanle, pva and fva . based on the low retrotransposition rates obtained for elements of these families in vitro and high divergence of their 5’ and 3’ domain sequences from the family consensus  <cit> , we assume that they are no longer active. most likely their vntr regions have degenerated to an extent where an internal structure that might have existed at the time of their amplification is no longer recognizable.

vntr remodelling occurs at the dna level in both sva and lava
the existence of sva_d elements shared between human and chimpanzee provided us with the opportunity to investigate evolution of vntrs by pairwise comparison between elements derived from a common ancestor that has integrated before the human/chimpanzee split. overall, the orthologous elements in human and chimpanzee were found to display vntrs more similar to each other than vntrs of unrelated human sva_d copies . the formal vntr code of the respective orthologs  suggests that entire rus have been lost or acquired. closer inspection of the pairwise alignments , however, shows that segments of rus have been deleted/inserted. if deletion is assumed, then a new repeat unit is formed by combination of parts of the rus flanking the breakpoint at its 5’ and 3’ ends . in case of insertion, the newly inserted sequence would be composed of segments of different rus. all ru copy number variations of this type  are characterized by microhomologies  at the breakpoints . this suggests that a microhomology-driven mechanism mediates vntr remodelling at the dna level.figure  <dig> vntr remodeling at the dna level.  comparison of the repeat unit schemata of orthologous sva_d elements in human and chimpanzee. d <dig> to d <dig> are generic identifiers. the genomic positions of the elements are provided in additional file  <dig>  repeat unit arrays detailed in b, c and d are highlighted in grey. a likely duplication in the human d <dig> ortholog is marked with an arrow. hsa – homo sapiens; ptr – pan troglodytes.  and  represent examples of indels resulting from a microhomology-driven mechanism. repeat units are separated by dashes; microhomologies are highlighted in grey. note that in  identity within the microhomology is not 100% - likely due to divergent sequence evolution in the two species. bp – breakpoint  shows an example of repeat unit conversion resulting from small scale insertion/deletion. the complete pairwise alignments for all ten elements analyzed are provided in additional file 1: figure s <dig> 



only in two cases  there is precise excision/insertion of an ru. we also observed two instances of “micro” indels of 3 bp each, resulting in conversion of an a-type ru to a c-type ru or vice versa .

because of lack of information on the vntr structure of the original elements in the human/chimpanzee ancestor it cannot be decided whether the differences in the ru patterns have resulted from insertions or deletions. however, a comparison of element d <dig> to the conserved ru patterns of the other elements  suggests that at the vntr 5’ end a duplication of the abc ru array has taken place in humans.

for lava there is no sequence information available for elements shared between species/genera. however, a small group of lava elements amplified as part of segmental duplications in nomascus leucogenys. similarly to the sva_d orthologs in human and chimpanzee, these elements are derived from a common ancestor without an rna intermediate. any changes in the vntr must, therefore, have occurred at the dna level. alignment of the eight elements of the group reveals microhomologies at the breakpoints of all three cases of ru copy number variation . thus, we conclude that the same microhomology-driven mechanism mediates vntr remodelling at the dna level in both human sva and gibbon lava.

to assess whether slippage of the reverse transcriptase in the process of target primed reverse transcription might contribute to vntr remodelling, we compared the vntr sequence of lava_f de novo integrants obtained in cell-based retrotransposition assays  <cit>  to that of their source element in the transfected vector. no differences could be observed. we consider it therefore unlikely that vntr expansion/retraction takes place at the rna level.

the lava vntr contains determinants of mobilization efficiency
in a previous study we established that the structural determinants of lava mobilization differ from those of sva, and that the lava 3’ part attenuates retrotransposition capacity  <cit> . in an attempt to further characterize the contribution of the different domains of lava elements  to overall mobilization efficiency, we constructed chimeras by reciprocally exchanging either the 5’ domains or the 3’ domains or both between the active lava_f <dig> and the inactive lava_e described previously  <cit> . the structure of the domain swaps is shown in figure 7a. quite surprisingly – against the background that major retrotransposition determinants of the other vntr composites localize to their 5’ domains  <cit>  – we found that all chimeras containing the vntr of the active lava_f <dig> were active as well. by contrast, none of the chimeras containing the vntr of the inactive lava_e was mobilized by l <dig> in trans. these results provided first evidence that determinants of efficient mobilization are localized in the vntr domain of lava elements.figure  <dig> determinants of lava mobilization efficiency are localized in the vntr.  schematic representation of the lava_e – lava_f chimeras tested. 5’ and 3’ domains of lava_e and lava_f were reciprocally exchanged at the alu-like/vntr junction and/or the vntr/3’ part junction. note that lava_f elements are characterized by a 3’ truncated alu-like region.  retrotransposition reporter assay following selection with g <dig>  cells were co-transfected with driver  and the respective mneoi-tagged chimeras or the lava_e/lava_f full-length constructs. retrotransposition rates  are given relative to that of the full-length lava_f <dig> construct .  repeat unit  schemata of the two lava elements tested. ru arrays corresponding to the respective subfamily consensus are highlighted in grey.



to exclude that the effect observed resulted from incompatibility between the lava_f <dig> domains  and the particular 5’ structure of the lava_e vntr, we initiated a second set of experiments in which domains were exchanged between an active and an inactive element of the same subfamily: lava_f. the structure of the chimeras and the results of the experiments are shown in figure  <dig>  again, inclusion of the vntr of the inactive element in the chimeras led to a drastic reduction in retrotransposition efficiency to the level obtained for the inactive element . however, contrary to the results obtained for the lava_e/lava_f <dig> chimeras, the “lava_f only” chimeras containing the vntr of the active element were mobilized at significantly different rates. combination of the active ct/alu-like/vntr with the 3’ domain of the inactive element resulted in a retrotransposition rate comparable to that of the active element . presence of the inactive ct/alu-like in chimeras i_a 5’ and i_a_i  resulted in a  <dig> to 60% reduction of the mobilization rate compared to the active element. from these findings we conclude that  the structure and/or length of the vntr are crucial for efficient mobilization and  the 5’ ct/alu-like domain of lava elements modulates retrotransposition rates.figure  <dig> the hexameric repeat/alu-like domain modulates vntr determined lava mobilization capacity.  schematic representation of the lava_f chimeras tested. 5’ and 3’ domains of the two lava_f elements were reciprocally exchanged at the alu-like/vntr junction and/or the vntr/3’ part junction.  retrotransposition reporter assay following selection with g <dig>  cells were co-transfected with driver  and the respective mneoi-tagged chimeras or the lava_f full-length constructs. retrotransposition rates  are given relative to that of the full-length lava_f <dig> construct .  repeat unit  schemata of the two lava elements tested. ru arrays corresponding to the respective subfamily consensus are highlighted in grey.



discussion
sva and lava vntrs evolve at the level of structural organization
up to date the investigation of vntr composite evolution has been largely limited to the analysis of their 5’ ct/alu-like and 3’ sine-r /u1-alusz-u2-l1me  domains. this has been complemented by the observations that vntr length is negatively correlated with time   <cit>  and that in the younger subfamilies the vntr 5’ and 3’ parts are clearly distinct with regard to their repeat unit content  <cit> . we now show that the vntrs of both hominid  sva and gibbon lava evolve along the networks established for the elements’ 3’ domains. organization of the vntr in terms of the arrangement of repeat units is clearly subfamily-specific and has evolved over time. thus, sequence evolution in the elements’ 3’ parts is paralleled by structural evolution in the vntr. vntr composites are, to our knowledge, the only non-ltr retrotransposons harbouring complex internal tandem repeats. it is therefore difficult to draw parallels to the evolution of other class i mobile elements. studies addressing the evolution of vntrs across primates are scarce. interspecies differences in length and composition have been reported e.g. for the vntrs in the serotonin transporter gene promoter  <cit>  and in intron  <dig>  <cit> , in the monoamine oxidase a upstream regulatory region  <cit>  and in the dopamine receptor d <dig> coding region  <cit> . these vntrs have been shown to be involved in transcriptional  <cit>  and post-transcriptional  <cit>  regulation. their evolution can be assumed to be constrained by their function in regulation of gene expression. when/if sva/lava vntrs act as transcription regulatory sequences for nearby genes, the same constraints apply. an additional set of constraints on their evolution can be assumed to be imposed by their characteristics as non-autonomous retrotransposons and by the necessity to escape host surveillance in order to amplify.

sva and lava vntrs differ in organization and complexity
lava elements have initially been identified based on the alu-like and vntr domains shared with sva  <cit> . the analysis presented here now reveals differences between the vntrs of lava and sva. whereas these are not evident in the respective oldest subfamilies, sva_a and lava_a, from the b subfamilies onwards the two families can be clearly distinguished based on their vntr repeat unit content and organization. in lava at maximum five rus appear to be conserved between elements of the same subfamily at the 5’ end . in sva, by contrast, subfamily specific 5’ arrays of between seven and fourteen rus are discernible. in addition, svas of human subfamilies d to f as well as of chimpanzee sva_pta are characterized by internal and 3’ terminal arrays composed of one to four copies of a long ru , a 41 bp g-type ru and a short c-type ru. a similar tendency of the vntr central part made up of repeated arrays of rus is to be observed in the younger orangutan sva subfamilies .

lava elements, however, lack such repeated internal arrays. it is only in the youngest lava subfamilies e, f <dig> and f, that 3’ arrays including longer  ru types  arise. the comparison between sva and lava vntrs does, however, require qualification: the quality of the gibbon genome build from which lava sequences were obtained is still lower than that of the current human build. due to their repetitive nature and the presence of repeat units identical in sequence at different positions in the vntr, vntrs are difficult to assemble when sequence overlap is used. a considerable number of lava elements still display assembly gaps. thus, we cannot completely exclude that lava subfamily specific internal ru arrays exist. they are possibly “hidden” in the deficiencies of the current genome assembly.

interestingly, in lava subfamilies c <dig>  c <dig> and e, elements with two different ru arrays at their 5’ ends are found . theoretically, the c <dig> and c <dig> elements displaying the 53 bp n-type ru could have resulted from gene conversion taking place between a lava_e  and a lava_c <dig> or c <dig> element lacking the n-type ru. in this case the sequence of the alu-like region would be expected to correspond  to the lava_e consensus. except for a single c <dig> element this is not the case . likewise, the minority fraction of lava_e elements lacking the n-type ru could have been derived from another subfamily. however, both the 5’ and 3’ domains of these elements conform to the lava_e subfamily consensus.

vntr remodelling takes place at the dna level and involves microhomologies
our finding that remodelling of vntrs takes place at the dna level is in line with a recent report on the existence of allelic variants of sva vntrs  <cit> . interestingly, the authors of the studies found ru copy number variation only in the 3’ part characterized by the long f and k repeat units  and not in the 5’ part  which comprises  <dig> to 40 bp rus  only. in our test set, by contrast, ru copy number variation is found in both the 5’ and 3’ arrays .

with regard to the mechanism which mediates expansion or contraction in the sva vntr region, ostertag and colleagues  <cit>  discussed “unequal homologous recombination” but cited levinson . hancks and kazazian  <cit>  suggested non-allelic homologous recombination . nahr by unequal crossing over appears unlikely, given that the homology blocks found at the breakpoints are – with one exception – considerably shorter than the 34 bp reported as minimum length of an efficient processing segment  <cit> . slipped-strand mispairing  <cit>  or replication slippage requires that the two segments identical in sequence occur within the region expected to be single-stranded during replication. thus, there is a limitation to the distance between the two homologous sequences – in humans of about 200 bp . the largest indel identified in our analysis extends over 192 bp . all other indels affect at most three rus, in most of the cases only a single ru is lost/duplicated. remodelling of sva/lava vntrs at the dna level, therefore, meets the requirements for replication slippage. however, microhomologies at breakpoints have also been observed for two other mechanisms involved in the generation of copy number variation: microhomology-mediated end joining  and microhomology-mediated break-induced replication . mmej is frequently accompanied by the insertion of nucleotides at the breakpoint  which we did not observe in our sample. mmbir involves annealing of 3’ single-stranded ends to the lagging strand template of another fork . the model, however, has been developed to explain duplication/deletion events whose lengths exclude replication slippage in a single fork as the causative mechanism  <cit> . as all mechanisms presented have different requirements in terms of the proteins involved, it would be interesting to see what happens to retrotransposon vntrs in test systems lacking components of the respective pathways. this, however, is beyond the scope of the current study.

what is the function of the vntr in retrotransposition?
in sva complete deletion of the vntr leads to a significant reduction in mobilization rates, whereas partial deletion results in an increase  <cit> . these observations permit, however, only limited conclusions on the role of the vntr in retrotransposition. all deletion mutants tested by hancks and colleagues  <cit>  are characterized by a juxtaposition of sequence and structural features in a way that does not exist in nature . our analysis shows that the vntr internal structure of the younger sva subfamilies is complex and well conserved – indicating a role for the vntr in retrotransposition. it is tempting to speculate that the vntr stabilizes the elements’ rna secondary structure in a way that ensures a specific orientation of the 5’ ct/alu-like domain and the 3’ sine-r relative to each other. the internal k1-4gc’ arrays do not appear to affect mobilization efficiency, as all sva elements reported to be active in the literature  differ with respect to their presence and number .

surprisingly, we found that in lava the vntr of an active element can confer retrotransposition competence when combined with the 5’ and 3’ domains of an inactive element. thus, key determinants for efficient mobilization appear to be localized in the lava central domain. the data obtained for chimeras between active and inactive elements of the same subfamily  point to a modulatory role of the 5’ ct/alu-like region of lava.

overall, these findings provide further support for the notion that the requirements for efficient mobilization differ between sva and lava: in sva key determinants reside in the 5’ hexameric repeat/alu-like region  <cit> . lava retrotransposition efficiency, in contrast, seems to depend on characteristics of the vntr. there appears to be only a modulatory function for the 5’ domain.

the comparison of the vntrs does not provide any clues on specific structures that might characterize an active element, except for an obvious difference in length between the active lava_f and the inactive elements. both lava_e and the active lava_f differ from the subfamily consensus 3’ array by one ru, whereas the inactive lava_f shows deviation from the subfamily consensus in both the 5’ and 3’ arrays . the question of which of the internal rus or ru arrays are critical for lava retrotransposition will, at least, require comparison of the vntr across a larger number of active elements. unfortunately, additional lava elements tested so far proved to be inactive as well.

the sva vntr and transcriptional silencing
recently, two independent studies  <cit>  addressed the role of krab zinc-finger  proteins and their cofactor trim28/kap <dig> in transcriptional silencing of retrotransposons in human embryonic stem cells. both found a preferential association of trim28/kap <dig> with sva elements. turelli and colleagues  <cit>  note that trim28/kap <dig> “was significantly more associated with older family members  than with their younger, human restricted counterparts ”. they also state that trim28/kap1-bound sva elements contain a significantly higher number of repeat units in the vntr. thus, there appears to be a connection between the sva vntr and trim28/kap <dig> recruitment. it will be interesting to see whether there is a correlation between different vntr structures, as determined in our study, and trim28/kap <dig> binding.

jacobs and colleagues identified znf <dig> as the kznf that recruits trim28/kap <dig> to svas in the human genome  <cit> . using reporter gene assays they demonstrated that the vntr domain of a human sva_d element is necessary and sufficient for znf91-mediated transcriptional repression. interestingly, only human znf <dig> and a reconstructed hominine znf <dig>  were found to efficiently repress sva_d-driven reporter gene activity. these two znf <dig> variants differ from great ape znf <dig>  and orangutan znf <dig>  amongst others, by the presence of additional seven zinc fingers. the structural changes giving rise to hominine znf <dig> occurred 8– <dig> million years  ago, after the split of orangutan from the gorilla/chimpanzee/human lineage  <cit> . this coincides with the time of emergence of sva subfamilies sva_b to sva_d   <cit> . sva_b is the first subfamily in which longer repeat units  are found in the vntr. the repeat unit patterns established for our sample sets of sva_b and sva_c elements  suggest that at the time of their amplification there probably existed internal amplifying rus  comparable to those found in sva_d to sva_f. by contrast to the kgc’ arrays in the younger subfamilies sva_d to sva_f, mainly i-type rus amplified in sva_b and sva_c. testing the repressive capacity of great ape versus hominine znf <dig> with sva_b and sva_c elements could, possibly, establish the relative timing of structural changes in sva vntrs and of those in znf <dig> 

our analysis of orangutan svas revealed that new subfamilies emerged in this lineage. they are characterized not only by distinct sequences of their sine-r domains, but also show subfamily-specific organization of the vntr. evolution of the vntr structure in orangutan svas appears to be governed by the same principle as observed for hominine svas: organization of the central part of the vntr in arrays of repeat units and expansion/amplification of these arrays. once the necessary tools  will be available, it will be interesting to see whether and how vntr structural evolution is linked to kznf/kap1-mediated control in this species.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented show that the central vntr domain of lava and sva evolves at the level of structural organization involving family- and subfamily-specific repeat units. whereas in lava only the 5’ and 3’ ends of the domain are clearly structured, the younger sva subfamilies are characterized by highly organized internal amplifying ru arrays. the composition of these arrays differs between the orangutan and chimpanzee/human lineages. the lineage-specific differences observed in the central domain are likely to influence the interaction of lava and sva with host factors regulating their expression and mobilization. our observations therefore provide a starting point for further investigations aiming to explain and understand the differences in amplification dynamics of vntr composite retrotransposons across hominoids.
