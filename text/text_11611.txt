BACKGROUND
one task in systems biology is to infer and model gene regulatory networks. the ultimate aim is to identify the underlying regulatory events of a system as a response to external stimuli. thus, the regulators, their target genes and the mode of interaction need to be determined. network inference reverse engineers regulatory networks with the help of high-throughput data and has been successfully applied in a number of studies ranging from immune diseases  <cit> , full genomic models of escherichia coli  <cit>  and saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit>  to models of pathogenic fungi  <cit> . various approaches have been proposed for this task such as bayesian networks  <cit> , models based on information theory  <cit> , regression based models  <cit> , and differential equation models  <cit> . it has been shown that the integration of different data sources improves the result of the inference approach  <cit> . thus, several tools exploit different kinds of data within their reverse engineering algorithm  <cit> . few regulatory models for the infection process of human pathogenic bacteria have been suggested  <cit> , while there exists only one model dealing with a human pathogenic fungus  <cit> . modelling gene regulatory networks of pathogenic fungi is hampered by the small number of annotated gene functions, the small number of known gene regulatory interactions and the fact that many transcription profiles focus on complicated infection processes. in contrast to defined laboratory conditions, multiple environmental parameters  change during infection. each parameter leads to changes in the gene expression profiles, making it difficult to conclude which environmental change leads to which effect. furthermore, superposed and secondary effects are likely. in this paper we will focus on one specific aspect during the infection process and propose the first computational model of the regulation of iron acquisition when c. albicans is in contact with and invades into oral epithelial cells.

c. albicans is a harmless commensal yeast living in many warm blooded animals  <cit> . however, the fungus can change its behaviour to an aggressive pathogen within immunocompromised patients or in individuals with disrupted homeostasis of the host microbial flora  <cit> . commonly, patients suffer from superficial mucusal infections, but the fungus is also able to enter the bloodstream and to cause systemic infections with high mortality rates  <cit> . the number of infections has dramatically increased within the last decades, mainly because of a growing number of susceptible individuals   <cit> . strikingly, c. albicans is able to adapt to a wide range of environmental changes such as ph, nutrient shift and temperature, and can infect virtually every human organ  <cit> . during infection, the fungus is able to reversibly change its growth form from an ovoid yeast growth form to elongated pseudohyphal and hyphal growth forms. this so called yeast-hypha transition has been shown to be an important virulence trait because hyphae are able to actively penetrate and destroy tissue  <cit> . adherence, invasion and destruction of different human tissue are important virulence attributes of c. albicans. other important virulence factors are genes involved in the interaction with cells of the immune system as well as genes involved in nutrient acquisition, stress response, and interaction with other host cells  <cit> .

iron is an essential mineral required as a cofactor for several proteins, as well as for a number of biochemical processes. however, within the human host, iron is bound to storage proteins such as haemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, and lactoferrin. consequently, there is almost no free iron available  <cit> . thus, the acquisition of this mineral is an important virulence attribute of most pathogens. the importance of an effective and robust iron uptake system in c. albicans is indicated by three facts: first, the c. albicans genome contains more iron acquisition genes than that of the non-pathogenic yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. second, colonization, as well as proliferation, are only possible if sufficient amounts of this mineral are accessible  <cit> . third, mutations of certain genes involved in iron uptake increase the sensitivity of the pathogen to antifungal drugs  <cit>  or reduce the virulence of the pathogen  <cit> .

c. albicans exhibits at least three different iron uptake systems reflecting the possibility of acquiring iron under very different environmental conditions . one possible iron source are siderophores, small iron chelating compounds with a high affinity for the mineral, secreted by microorganisms. even though there seem to be no genes coding for siderophore biosynthesis factors  <cit> , c. albicans is able to use siderophores produced by other microorganisms. one transporter of ferrichrome siderophore uptake has been identified  <cit> . haemoglobin can also be exploited as an iron source  <cit> . both, a haemoglobin-receptor gene family and a gene coding for a heme-oxygenase have been identified  <cit> . to utilize iron from transferrin, ferritin or the environment, c. albicans uses a high affinity reductive pathway consisting of three steps. in the first step insoluble extracellular ferric iron  is reduced to its soluble ferrous form . the c. albicans genome codes for  <dig> putative ferric reductases, which are able to facilitate this reduction  <cit> . in the second step, toxic ferrous iron is oxidised to ferric iron via five potential multicopper oxidases. in the last step, iron permeases form a complex with the multicopper oxidases and transport ferric iron into the cell. four putative permease genes exist in the c. albicans genome  <cit> . given the fact that the fungal genome codes for a set of similar proteins which are putatively able to perform each single step of iron uptake, it is of high interest to study which proteins are used during invasion of epithelial cells at which time.

in vitro studies have identified a number of genes and regulators involved in the response of c. albicans to limited iron  <cit> . rim <dig> is a transcription factor involved in alkaline ph response  <cit> . however, transcript profiling of rim <dig> knockout mutants also revealed a number of differentially expressed iron acquisition genes  <cit> . furthermore, the ferric reductase genes frp <dig> and fre <dig> are directly regulated by interaction with rim <dig>  <cit> . tup <dig> is a general transcriptional co-repressor which is involved in the regulation of reductive iron uptake  <cit> . several iron transport genes were differentially expressed upon deletion of tup <dig>  <cit> . however, tup <dig> may not bind directly to dna and its mode of interaction remains unclear. pelletier and co-workers identified sfu <dig> as a suppressor of iron uptake which is able to specifically bind to dna  <cit> . furthermore, they show direct interaction of s. pombe tup <dig> and c. albicans sfu1fileading to the hypothesis that sfu <dig> is the dna binding protein which recruits the general co-repressor tup <dig> to the promoters of iron acquisition genes . this idea is further referred to as the "sfu1-tup <dig> hypothesis". in a phenotype study of all transcription factors of c. albicans , the regulator sef <dig> was shown to be involved in controlling the expression of iron acquisition genes  <cit> . however, the molecular action of sef <dig> still remains unclear. baek et al. demonstrated that cbf transcription factors are involved in chelator mediated induction of frp <dig> expression via specific dna binding  <cit> . although there exists some knowledge about the regulation of iron acquisition genes in vitro, almost nothing is known about their regulation when c. albicans is adhering to and penetrating into epithelial cells.

in this study we propose the first computational model of the regulation of iron acquisition genes in c. albicans using high-throughput gene expression time series data during contact with and invasion into human oral epithelial cells  <cit> . our modelling approach is based on linear differential equations and utilizes selection criteria such as sparseness and robustness  <cit> . the integration of different data sources has been shown to improve the reverse engineering approach  <cit> . hence, our model softly integrates three kinds of prior knowledge: transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , in vitro expression data under limited iron  <cit> , as well as analysis of transcription factor knockout mutants  <cit> . the final model consists of a number of gene regulatory relationships. some of them are validated by literature, while others reveal yet unknown biological relevant interactions.

RESULTS
differentially expressed genes during contact to and invasion of oral epithelium
with the aim of modelling, candidate genes were filtered from the set of differentially expressed and by using overrepresented go categories. data preprocessing identified  <dig> genes which were differentially expressed during experimental rhe infection at at least one point in time using an adjusted p-value cut-off of  <dig> . gene ontology  processes enrichment analysis was used in order to identify key biological processes most significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes during adherence to and invasion into human epithelial cells . examples for significantly enriched categories are "pathogenesis", "fungal-type spore wall assembly", "adhesion to host". this shows that the definition of differentially expressed genes is capable of identifying biologically relevant genes, i.e. genes involved in processes relevant to virulence. the go category "iron ion transport" was most significantly enriched with genes differentially expressed during experimental rhe infection. fifteen out of  <dig> genes annotated to this process were differentially expressed. even though most go category annotations are based on sequence similarity to the distantly related baker's yeast s. cerevisiae, this high number of differentially expressed iron acquisition genes suggested that this process is important during interaction with human oral epithelium.

the c. albicans genome codes for at least  <dig> putative ferric reductases able to perform the first step of iron uptake via the high affinity reductive pathway. the functional annotations for only three of these corresponding genes have been experimentally validated: cfl <dig>  fre <dig>  frp <dig>  <cit> . during experimental rhe infection nine genes putatively coding for ferric reductases were differentially expressed. the dynamics of expression levels of these genes varies significantly, suggesting that the fungus uses different specific reductases under different conditions ). the functional annotation of these nine proteins is based on sequence similarity to s. cerevisiae. this study supposes for the first time that those genes are used by c. albicans during interaction with epithelial cells.

of five genes potentially coding for ferric oxidases, two were differentially expressed during experimental rhe infection: fet <dig> and fet <dig>  which were also up-regulated under in vitro limited iron conditions  <cit> . the dynamics of expression levels of the two genes were similar, although fet <dig> was slightly higher expressed ).

fth <dig>  a gene coding for a ferric permease, is up-regulated early during the first hour of experimental rhe infection ).

there are three further differentially expressed genes annotated to the go category "iron transport": the first, orf <dig> , codes for an ortholog of mrs <dig> in s. cerevisiae. interestingly, this protein is directly involved in mitochondrial iron uptake under conditions when this mineral is limited  <cit> . the second, orf <dig> , codes for a protein which is similar to ise <dig>  a member of the fe/s cluster biosynthesis machinery of the mitochondrial matrix in baker's yeast  <cit> . the third gene, ccc <dig>  codes for a putative fe2+/mn2+ transporter which mediates vascular iron storage and is thus important to control the cytosolic iron level  <cit> .

during the adherence to and penetration into epithelial cells, the fungus is faced with a number of environmental changes. to adapt to new environments, c. albicans dramatically alters its regulatory program. this is demonstrated by a total number of  <dig> differentially expressed genes annotated to the go category "transcription regulator activity". a number of regulators have been identified to control the expression of iron acquisition genes . the genes rim <dig>  hap <dig>  sef <dig> and tup <dig>  coding for transcriptional regulators, are differentially expressed during experimental rhe infection ) and thus used as candidate genes within the modelling approach. another regulator which has been shown to be involved in suppressing iron transport genes is sfu <dig>  <cit> . however, sfu <dig> it is not differentially expressed during experimental rhe infection. possible explanations for this fact might be that the gene is transiently expressed, or the transcription factor activity might be regulated at the protein level. this study tests the "sfu <dig> - tup <dig> hypothesis" . this means that the molecular mode of sfu <dig> is indirectly modelled .

time course of iron limitation
the used tool for regulatory network inference is based on differential equations and models the expression of a gene at a specific timepoint as the weighted sum of the expression of all other genes and an external stimulus . in this study the perturbation function models the decreasing amount of iron the fungus is faced with during experimental infection. as it is unknown how the availability of iron for c. albicans changes over time during the experimental rhe infection, different types of perturbation profiles describing the iron availability were tested. a decreasing amount of the mineral was used as the environmental stimulus of the network model, reflected by the perturbation function u . network models were predicted for fourteen different types of perturbation functions and the model-error, as well as the data-error were compared . best results were achieved with an exponential decrease of iron during experimental rhe infection. furthermore, there was a slight decrease of the data-error if the early availability of iron was modelled with a decrease after a certain delay. optimal values were achieved by using a constant iron concentration until  <dig> minutes followed by an exponential decrease of iron . the model-error is also minimal for this perturbation function, which therefore was used in the final model. the data-error and the model-error increase again when using a  <dig> minutes delay. it seems that c. albicans is not exposed to higher levels of iron within  <dig> hours post infection, since a perturbation function with a growing amount of iron generates a higher data and model error.

regulatory network of iron acquisition genes
a regulatory network model was inferred which is based on differential equations and an exhaustive list of prior knowledge based on other data than time series gene expression data . figure  <dig> presents this regulatory network model . the model consists of fifteen differentially expressed iron acquisition genes and four differentially expressed regulators. the modelling approach found a sparse network with  <dig> edges. the differential equation model is still able to give a good fit to the measured time series data . the initial model fits to the time series data with a data-error of  <dig>  and to the prior knowledge with a model-error of  <dig> . to indicate which edges of this model are robust to random fluctuations, the time series data were perturbed and the modelling approach was iterated  <dig> times . perturbing the time series data causes only a small change of the quality of the inferred networks, which is quantified by a mean data-error of  <dig>  with a variance of  <dig> . regulatory interactions which are robust against perturbing the time series data are also robust against changing parts of the prior knowledge. thus, the cross-validation of the prior knowledge  resulted in four interactions which were found more than 50% in the random perturbed models but less than 50% in the cross-validation models. six interactions not predicted by the initial model were predicted more than 50% in all models predicted by the cross-validation of prior knowledge and perturbation of time series. when increasing the cut-off, which defines an edge to be stable, the number of inferred edges decreases in a nearly linear way . the most stable edges are those with the highest score in the prior knowledge. furthermore, regulatory influences from the perturbation proove that they are very stable.

the proposed modelling approach is capable of identifying biological meaningful interactions, which is illustrated by the rediscovery of already known transcription factor target genes. for example, the inferred regulation of cfl <dig> by rim <dig> and fre <dig> by tup <dig> has been shown with the help of in vitro emsa and northern blots  <cit> . furthermore, the model provides the first evidence that these interactions take place during experimental rhe infection.

a number of further interactions predicted by the prior knowledge are found in the final model. there are twelve interactions in the model which were predicted by in vitro expression studies . this study adds first evidence of these regulatory interactions taking place when c. albicans adheres to and invades into epithelial cells. a total of  <dig> interactions predicted by the occurrence of tfbs  can be found in the model. seven of these  <dig> putative interactions are additionally predicted by source  <dig> or source  <dig> while  <dig> are exclusively predicted by source  <dig>  since there is no former evidence in the literature, this is the first time that these genes are predicted to be target genes of the respective transcription factors .

for each regulator the number of compiled prior knowledge edges, the number of inferred edges consistent with this prior knowledge, and newly predicted target genes are shown. for description of the three prior knowledge sources see methods. a target gene is scored as "newly predicted" if it was predicted by the time series data without prior knowledge, or if it was predicted by prior knowledge based on the occurrence of tfbs  and was found to be consistent with the time series data. newly predicted target genes are ordered in respect to the stability of the regulatory interaction .

the inferred network model shows a hub like structure. given a number of potential transcription factor - target gene interactions proposed by the prior knowledge, those interactions are preferred in the final model. hap <dig> regulates eleven target genes, tup <dig> eight and rim <dig> regulates seven genes. this study gives the first proposal of a target gene for the transcriptional regulator sef1: fre <dig> . in most cases there are two evidences for these regulations to happen during the infection process. for example, the regulation of fth <dig> by rim <dig> is supported by the gene expression time series during rhe infection and the occurrence of the rim <dig> binding site in the upstream region of fth <dig>  in these cases the presented model predicts direct physical transcription factor - target gene interaction. even though they have a small score in the prior knowledge , regulatory interactions of hap <dig> prove very stable against random perturbation of the time series data and cross-validation of prior knowledge. in a network inferred without any prior knowledge, five interactions of hap <dig> are consistent with those proposed in the final model. all proposed target genes of tup <dig>  but not sef <dig>  have the sfu <dig> binding site in their upstream region. this adds further evidence to the "sfu1-tup <dig> hypothesis".

the model also provides suggestions of how the transcriptional regulators may be regulated. in most cases an influence by the external stimulus  is predicted, which might indicate regulations at protein level. however, hap <dig> might be involved in the transcriptional activation of rim <dig>  predicted by the occurrence of the hap <dig> binding site in the rim <dig> promoter and the time courses of both genes. furthermore, hap <dig> and rim <dig> seem to inhibit the expression of the gene coding for the general repressor tup <dig>  in this way hap <dig> and rim <dig> have an additional indirect positive influence on the transcriptional rate of iron acquisition genes by inhibiting their repressor. it is known that the repression of hub-like nodes increase the stability of a system  <cit> . table  <dig> summarises all predicted and inferred target genes of the transcriptional regulators in this study.

even though transcriptional regulator - target gene interactions are preferred by using the prior knowledge, the model also predicts indirect regulatory influences of one gene to another. for example, the gene coding for the putative mitochondrial transporter mrs <dig>  has a negative influence on the gene coding for the reductase fre <dig> . this might happen in cases where sufficient amount of iron is available and the fungus pumps it into the mitochondria.

there are  <dig> edges predicted by the prior knowledge which contradict the time series expression data or are not found to be robust and are thus not present in the proposed model. for example the regulation of fre <dig>  by rim <dig> was predicted under in vitro alkaline conditions but does not seem to occur during experimental rhe infection. furthermore, the modelling approach identified a number of  <dig> regulatory events which are not present in the prior knowledge. these are  <dig> self degradations, eight influences from the external stimulus, and seven gene- gene influences.

the proposed regulatory network model consists of  <dig> differentially expressed genes during experimental oral infection, which were chosen because they are involved in the important process of iron acquisition. however, there is a number of  <dig> remaining differentially expressed genes which are not covered by the model. with the help of fuzzy c-means clustering all differentially expressed genes were grouped into six significant time profiles . each cluster profile is characterised by having an extremum at one of the measured time points . for each profile, one of the genes of the proposed regulatory model can be considered as a profile-representative. in this way regulatory influences inferred by our model can be transferred to other pairs of genes within the respective profiles. the profiles contain a number of genes with so far unknown function. with the knowledge of co-expression patterns and the proposed regulatory influences in our model it is possible to infer putative functions for these genes.

this study used expression time series data from an experimental rhe infection. this experimental infection covers some important aspects of the oral infection process, such as the adherence to epithelial tissue, the yeast-hypha transition, tissue penetration, ph shift and limited iron. on the other hand, further important aspects are missing, such as the interaction with immune system cells and other microorganisms. the proposed modeling approach focuses on the regulation of iron acquisition genes. some of the proposed regulatory interactions might also happen during oral infection. the model proposes for the first time that rim <dig> directly activates fth <dig> and fre <dig>  and indirectly activates cfl <dig> and cfl <dig> via repressing the gene coding for their repressor tup <dig>  these predictions are supported by the occurrence of the respective tfbs in the upstream regulatory regions and the time series data. those four genes and rim <dig> are also up-regulated at least two-fold in an expression data set of patients suffering from oral candidiasis  <cit> . this implies that those regulatory interactions might also happen during real oral infections.

during experimental rhe infection, c. albicans is faced with a rapidly changing environment. the final gene expression pattern results from all these changing environmental parameters. a perturbation function was used, which models the limitation of iron. however, it remains unclear if the final gene regulatory interactions are a result of iron limitation or other changing environmental parameters. for instance, the transcription factor rim <dig> is also involved in alkaline ph response, i.e. an environmental factor which also changes during the infection process. in a follow-up experiment the expression profile of c. albicans in rich medium could be compared to the expression profile in a medium without iron. by performing in vitro iron limitation time series expression experiments the data could be used to clarify which of the proposed regulatory interactions in this study are only due to limited iron. these interactions could then be validated in further experiments. the proposed model here consists of a number of influences from the external perturbation whose molecular action remains unclear. with the help of in vitro iron limitation expression data it may be possible to identify so far unknown regulators whose role in iron acquisition as well as for virulence may be studied in the future. together with the proposed regulatory model in this study, which focuses on an infection condition, novel virulence factors may be identified.

a well known problem when using differential equation models with a high number of parameters is over-fitting. equation  <dig> consists of a large number of parameters while there are only five measured points in time. a model which uses all parameters would clearly over-fit the measured data. to overcome this problem the proposed modelling approach minimises the number of non-zero parameters by using a search strategy. furthermore, the soft integration of prior knowledge guides the inference approach to a knowledge-driven solution. finally, by disturbing the time series data and repeating the inference approach, parameters which are robustly unequal to zero were identified. another way of coping with over-fitting is cross-validation . this strategy was not used in this study because skipping parts of the rare measured data would disrupt the ratio between parameters and data points even further. another general limitation is that differential equation models assume the system to be in a steady state before the experiment. since c. albicans was grown on rich media before the actual experiment was performed this assumption is valid here.

CONCLUSIONS
this study focuses on a typical problem in systems biology where an interesting biological phenomenon is studied by a small number of experimentally available data points. to overcome this limitation a special modelling strategy is applied: first of all, the modelling approach searches for the most important features, variables and structure able to model the measured kinetics. second, random perturbation of the input data is used to infer robust regulatory interactions. finally, different data sources other than time series expression data were used to overcome the data limitation. the present study uses three heterogeneous data sources to compile an exhaustive list of prior knowledge which is softly integrated into the modelling approach and thus guides the network prediction to a knowledge assisted solution. with the help of this strategy a number of biologically relevant gene regulatory interactions were predicted, even in the case of a limited amount of data. the strategy of using prior knowledge to overcome identification problems arising from a small amount of data could be used in many systems biology application.

this study focused on one particular process of c. albicans during contact with and invasion into human oral epithelial cells: the regulation of iron acquisition genes. initially it proposed fifteen iron acquisition and four genes coding for regulators which c. albicans activates during experimental rhe infection. furthermore, a network model is proposed consisting of  <dig> regulatory relationships during experimental rhe infection process. some of them have already been found in in other in vitro studies. this confirmation demonstrates that the employed inference approach is capable of identifying biologically relevant interactions. a number of further yet unknown interactions were predicted. especially, a number of further target genes for transcription factors involved in regulating iron acquisition genes were predicted. the model predicted four new target genes of rim <dig>  additionally, three potential target genes predicted by in vitro analysis of knockout mutants were also regulated by rim <dig> during experimental rhe infection. the first target gene of sef <dig> was predcited: fre <dig> . eleven target genes were newly predicted to be regulated by hap <dig>  further evidence was found for the supporting the hypothesis that sfu <dig> is the dna binding protein recruiting tup <dig> to the promoters of iron acquisition genes . one gene was newly predicted to be regulated this way ). five potential target genes of tup <dig>  which were already predicted by expression analysis of knockout mutants, were now predicted to be also regulated during experimental rhe infection by the sfu <dig> - tup <dig> complex. very interestingly, potential regulations of the transcription factors are proposed. hap <dig> is involved in the regulation of the gene coding for rim <dig> and tup <dig>  rim <dig> and hap <dig> repress tup <dig> during rhe infection. in this way the two regulators activate iron acquisition genes also indirectly by repressing their transcriptional repressor. there is evidence that some of the proposed regulatory interactions might also happen during oral infection. the gene coding for rim <dig> and three direct target genes , cfl <dig> ) proposed by the model were also up-regulated within expression data of patients suffering from oral candidiasis.

in follow-up experiments it will first be necessary to determine which of the proposed regulatory interactions are due to other changing parameters during infection process than iron limitation. the remaining interactions could then be experimentally validated. this would lead to more detailed insights into the mechanisms of how pathogens regulate important processes, such as iron acquisition, during infection processes. these insights could be transferred to other pathogenic organisms, especially closely related pathogenic fungi such as c. dubliniensis or c. tropicalis. moreover, with the help of clustering results, it is also possible build hypotheses of regulatory influences between genes with so far unknown function.
