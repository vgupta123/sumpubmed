BACKGROUND
in a seminal paper published more than  <dig> years ago  <cit> , f. jacob and j. monod proposed a generic mechanism for protein synthesis in cells, whereby a dna gene produces a messenger rna molecule  which is then used to produce the corresponding protein. they also described how this gene expression process is controlled by cytosolic macromolecules called repressors, that stop the expression of a given gene by binding to it. since then, it was discovered that repressors are actually proteins  produced by other genes and that positive effectors  also exist  <cit> . fifty years of molecular studies have unravelled the complexity of the underlying molecular machinery  <cit> , but the existence and biological significance of such repression-based transcription systems have been thoroughly confirmed.

the design, insertion in cells and theoretical analysis of small synthetic transcriptional regulation networks have proven to be very useful to our understanding of the temporal dynamics of gene networks. from a purely theoretical standpoint  <cit> , repression-based transcriptional regulation loops , are generically expected to exhibit bistability with hysteresis  or a regime of spontaneous periodic oscillations . accordingly, insertion of 2-gene repression-based synthetic loops in bacteria indeed may give rise to bistable dynamics  <cit> , whereas 3-gene repression-based synthetic loops inserted into living bacteria are capable of spontaneous oscillations with a very long period   <cit> . in both articles  <cit> , the construction of the synthetic networks and their insertion and study in living bacteria were accompanied by a short theoretical study explaining why the observed dynamics were to be expected. in both cases, the complex dynamics of interest arose in the models via a bifurcation from a unique stable steady state: varying one kinetic parameter, the model predicts the occurrence of a saddle-node bifurcation supporting bistability  or a hopf bifurcation explaining the appearance of a limit cycle and its spontaneous oscillations . interestingly, both models consisted of ordinary differential equations  that assume mass action kinetics  <cit>  for all the reactions. this corresponds to a strong assumption about the internal medium of the cell that is supposed to be dilute, perfectly-stirred and spatially homogeneous. beyond its importance for switch-like or oscillator circuits, this view in fact has deep impact in the whole field of synthetic biology. when inserting synthetic gene network constructs in chassis cells, synthetic biologists usually do not consider that the spatial localisation of the corresponding plasmids or of the insertion points on the chromosome is an important parameter for the temporal dynamics of the synthetic construct. whereas this viewpoint seems reasonable if the hypothesis of a perfectly-mixed internal space is valid, it should be questioned if spatial homogeneity is violated.

actually, the traditional view of the interior of the cell as a perfectly-stirred and spatially homogeneous medium, where the concentration of each reactant would be identical wherever one measures it inside the cell, has increasingly been challenged by recent results, especially in bacterial cells. first, recent advances in the measurement of single particle trajectories inside living cells have unravelled that the bacterial cytoplasm is a complex, extremely crowded and dense medium that strongly affects molecule mobility in a spatially non-homogeneous way  <cit> . therefore, due to the intrinsic physical nature of the cytoplasm, mobility inside the cytoplasm may not guarantee perfect mixing and homogeneous spatial distribution of its constituents. recent experimental results have shown that the position of chromosomes in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells or the location of the genes on the bacterial chromosome are not random or perfectly-stirred but self-organized to sit on specific locations forming spatial maps that are stable over long time scales  <cit> . even in bacteria, transcription is believed to be organized spatially, with the major molecular actors assuming stable and defined intracellular locations  <cit> .

despite this accumulating evidence of the localization of the elements of transcriptional regulation networks inside the cell, the influence of spatial properties on the temporal dynamics of gene expression remains to be fully described. indeed, in the simplest instance of classical biochemical reactions, the impact of spatial localization has only recently received attention in the case of enzyme complexes  <cit>  and in the case of signalling clusters in membrane domains  <cit> . all these results show that spatial correlation strongly modifies the apparent chemical affinity involved in the pathway both for the transient and equilibrium behaviors. additionally, some evidence suggest that this depends strongly on the actual diffusion values.

in this paper, we use computer simulations to explore if and how the localization of the genes can influence the dynamics of small repression-based transcriptional regulation ring networks. we focus on repression-based transcriptional regulation loops composed of three genes, i.e. repressilators. using stochastic spatially-explicit individual-based computer simulations, we find that the localization in space of the genes is of crucial importance to the dynamics of the system since it controls even the global dynamics regime, i.e. whether the system fluctuates around stationary values or exhibits spontaneous oscillations. we show that when parameters related to the spatial organization of the genes change, the repressilator undergoes a sharp transition between the oscillatory and stationary regime. effective control spatial parameters include the degree of demixing of the gene locations or the spatial range  of the mrna and proteins. since this transition is very similar to the bifurcations along the kinetics parameters that are usually evoked to explain the appearance of the oscillatory regime, we refer to it as a space-induced bifurcation. our results therefore unravel the importance of spatial properties in the dynamics of transcriptional regulation networks. moreover, they suggest that the spatial localisation of the synthetic genes in the cell could be used as an additional toggle to control the dynamics of the inserted construct in synthetic biology experiments.

methods
our objective is to study the dynamics in time and intracellular space of a generic transcriptional circuit in a bacterial cell like e. coli. extensively detailed realistic modelling of bacteria , with experimentally-derived values for most rate constants, realistic cell space volume, protein size and diffusion coefficients, and interaction with the metabolism, starts to be accessible to today computer power  <cit> . however, those models bear the limitation that many of the parameters still lack experimentally-derived values. moreover, their computational cost still forbids to use them for thorough exploration of the parameter space with reasonable statistical significance, which is precisely the objective of the present work. we therefore opted for simpler models and restricted our focus to the study of the major processes implicated in transcriptional regulation  rather than taking into account extensive details of the cell intracellular machinery.

gene expression model
we considered a generic transcriptional circuit consisting of three genes gi, i∈{ <dig> ,2} assembled in a circular circuit, or ring network, so that gene i represses the expression of gene i+ <dig> . each gene gi is spontaneously  transcribed into mrna mi, that is in turn spontaneously translated to protein pi. each gene features two binding sites for its repressor protein set so as to achieve cooperative binding, i.e. the binding affinity is larger when the gene is already bound to a single protein. according to the circular circuit of figure 1a, each gene gi can bind the protein product of gene ī=mod and single- or double-binding of a gene shuts-off transcription . these processes can be described according to the following reaction schemes: 
  ∀i∈{ <dig> ,2},gi→αgi+mimi→βmi+pimi→1/τm∅pi→1/τp∅gi+pi¯⇌koffkongi⋆gi⋆+pi¯⇌koff2kongi⋆⋆ figure  <dig>

where we used mass conservation for the different bound fractions of the genes, i.e. gi+gi⋆+gi⋆⋆=git=constant.

parameter values and numerics
numerical integration  and bifurcation analysis were performed with xppaut . to keep the model as generic as possible, we expressed time in multiples of the integration time step , thus yielding reaction rate constants expressed as inverse of time steps. the bifurcation diagram was explored along the protein lifetime τp and the transcription rate α . those parameters were thus varied over several orders of magnitude. the values of the translation rate β and the mrna lifetime τm were set so as to ensure realistic copy numbers of proteins and mrnas. mrna copy number in single e. coli cells was quantified between < <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit>  or even up to  <dig> for strongly expressed promoters like the plac promoter under strong induction  <cit> . protein copy numbers vary over a wide range, from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> , resulting in a protein/mrna copy number ratio that is roughly between  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . in our model, the range of mrna/protein copy number mi/pi is given by the product of parameters τpβ. since τp was varied between  <dig> and  <dig> in the bifurcation diagram, we set β= <dig> . in e. coli, the typical lifetime of mrnas  is much smaller than that of proteins , especially fluorescent reporter proteins   <cit> . considering the range of values over which the protein lifetime τp was varied, we fixed τm= <dig> time steps.

the affinity of dna regulation proteins  for their specific dna site is also variable, but typically reported values are between  <dig> – <dig>  nm  <cit>  and several tens  of nm  <cit> . given a total e. coli cell volume of  <dig> fl  <cit> , we set kon=10− <dig> per molecule per time step and koff=10− <dig> and koff2=10− <dig> per time step. this corresponds to affinities of  <dig> and  <dig>  nm for the free  and singly-bound genes, respectively. finally, we considered that each of the three genes can be present in the bacterial cell in multiple copies . indeed, even with low copy number plasmids , each gene is introduced in 3− <dig> to  <dig> copies  <cit> . therefore, unless otherwise specified the number of copies per gene type was set to git= <dig> .

individual-based simulation of the spatial dynamics
a spatially-explicit stochastic individual-based  simulator of the set of biochemical reactions given by  was implemented as a lattice-based algorithm programmed in c. boundary conditions were periodic. each of the  <dig> gene types were present in gt copies.

spatial configuration of the genes
the initial locations of the 3gt genes were set according to one of the following three scenarios : 
in the uniform configuration, the 3gt gene copies were positioned at independent randomly-chosen lattice sites .spatial configurations of the genes in the individual-based model. this scheme illustrates the case g
t= <dig> in 2d. in the uniform configuration, the  <dig> gene copies are positioned at independent randomly-chosen lattice sites, whereas in the clustered and segregated configurations, we start by positioning internal boxes of linear size r at random positions in the lattice, and place the gene copies inside the boxes. in the clustered configuration, each box contains one copy of each gene type i∈{ <dig> ,2}, randomly positioned, while in the segregated configuration, each box receives all the g
t copies of gene  <dig>  or  <dig>  positioned at randomly chosen locations. when the internal box size r tends to the lattice size r, both clustered and segregated configurations converge to the uniform configuration.



in the clustered configuration, we first positioned gt internal boxes of linear size r on the lattice. one copy of each gene i∈{ <dig> ,2} per box was then positioned at a randomly chosen location inside the box.

in the segregated configuration, we first positioned  <dig> internal boxes of linear size r on the lattice. each of the  <dig> boxes received all of the gt copies of gene  <dig>  or  <dig>  positioned at randomly chosen locations inside the box.



when the box size r converges toward the lattice size r, the clustered and segregated configurations are closing to the uniform one. the ratio r/r can thus be used to quantify the amount of demixing : vanishing demixing for r/r→ <dig> and strong demixing for r/r→ <dig>  the thus defined gene locations were kept constant during the simulation, i.e. the genes were immobile.

simulation algorithm
at the beginning of each simulation, we place  <dig> mrna and  <dig> proteins of each type i at random positions  on the lattice. at each monte-carlo time step , the reaction events  are simulated according to the following schedule: 
each free  gene copy transcribes a new mrna molecule mi with probability α.

every mrna molecule mi can be degraded  or can translate a new protein pi . if not degraded, each mrna then undergoes a random walk step .

each free  protein is degraded with probability 1/τp or undergoes a random walk step .

whenever a free protein pi shares its lattice site with a free target gene gi−1¯ or singly-bound target gene gi−1¯⋆, binding occurs with probability kon.

bound gene-protein complexes that were formed before the current time step can unbind depending on their occupancy status, i.e. with probability koff or koff <dig>  if singly- or doubly-bound, respectively.



at each random walk step, the walker changes its current location with probability pmove, moving to one of its  <dig>  or  <dig>  randomly-chosen nearest neighbors . this corresponds to diffusion coefficient d=pmove/ <dig>  or d=pmove/ <dig> 2/time step . note that all diffusive molecules  have identical diffusion coefficient.

parameter values and numerics
the internode distance of the space lattice was set to Δx= <dig>  and the lattice size was set to r×r=400× <dig> a.u. <dig>  or r×r×r=60×60× <dig> a.u. <dig> . time was expressed in numbers of monte-carlo  time steps. regarding the values of the other parameters, our goal here was to compare with the dynamics predicted by mass action kinetics. therefore, unless otherwise specified, the standard set of parameters in the individual-based simulations was taken identical to the mass action kinetics model above, i.e. gt= <dig> copies, τm= <dig> mc time steps, τp= <dig> mc time steps; probability rates in −1: α=β= <dig> , koff=10− <dig> and koff2=10− <dig>  note that the value of kon for individual-based simulations is expected to differ from the value used in mass action law kinetics. indeed in the former, kon is a reaction probability rate upon reactant encounter in space, while in the latter kon is a classical reaction rate constant that, in addition to the reaction probability upon reactant encounter also accounts for reactant encounter probability. taking the size of the reaction volume into account  we estimated that kon= <dig> per mc time step per encounter in individual-based simulations was comparable with the value used in the mass action kinetics model. finally, the standard value of the movement probability was set to pmove= <dig> , yielding diffusion coefficients d= <dig>  or  <dig>  a.u.2/mc time step in 2d and 3d, respectively.

quantifying gene expression dynamics
to analyze the resulting simulation dynamics, we used the first zero crossing of the autocorrelation function. for each protein time series pi, j∈{ <dig> ,…,107} resulting from the individual-based simulations, we first sliced each protein time series into  <dig> segments of identical length l= <dig> time steps. on each window, the autocorrelation function was computed as 
 acf=𝔼pi−pi¯pi−pi¯σpi <dig>  where 𝔼 denotes expectation over the time points, pi¯ is the mean of the time series over the window, σpi <dig> its variance, j∈  and the lag time τ∈ . we then averaged the acf values across each segment of the time series. the first zero crossing of the thus averaged acf  is the smallest value τ <dig> such that acf= <dig>  one fzca was computed for each protein time series resulting from the individual-based simulation. for each simulation run, we retained the minimal value among the three estimated values . note that the first 2× <dig> mc time steps of each time series were rejected to discard transient behaviors.

RESULTS
here, we study a generic transcriptional circuit consisting of three genes gi, i∈{ <dig> ,2} forming a transcriptional ring network of repression: g <dig> represses the expression of g <dig>  g <dig> represses g <dig> and g <dig> closes the loop by repressing g <dig> . such repression-based transcriptional circuits are sometimes referred to as “repressilator” circuits in the literature  <cit> , because circuits made of odd numbers of negative interactions are, generically, potential spontaneous oscillators  <cit> . in agreement with the model proposed by jacob and monod  <cit> , we assume that each gene gi is active in the absence of bound protein, thus producing mrna transcripts mi  then the corresponding protein pi . each gene gi can bind up to two copies of its repressing protein, with cooperative binding. once bound, genes stop transcribing mrnas. mrnas and proteins have finite life-times τm and τp respectively. see methods for further details, in particular the set of elementary reaction schemes  that describes the system.

in the following, we study this generic repression-based transcriptional circuit with two modelling approaches: the traditional mass action kinetics, that assume perfectly-stirred conditions  thus neglecting the effects of spatial fluctuations and stochastic individual-based  simulations that explicitly take into account spatial fluctuations.

mass action kinetics predict spontaneous oscillations
the traditional approach in biochemistry to model the kinetics of such generic repression-based transcriptional circuit is based on the theory of elementary chemical reaction kinetics, usually referred to as “mass action kinetics”  <cit> . mass action kinetics are mean-field approximations assuming that the reaction medium is dilute, perfectly-stirred and spatially homogeneous. under those assumptions, one considers that the local fluctuations of reactant concentration  can be neglected and replaces local reactant concentrations by their average values over a large spatial domain . for the generic repression-based transcriptional circuit studied here, mass action kinetics yield the system of 3× <dig> coupled ordinary differential equations  shown as .

individual-based simulations predict strong dependence on the spatial locations of the genes
mass-action kinetics, albeit widely used, is actually just one methodology among several others to model the dynamics of the reaction set . to evaluate the possible effects of the spatial extension of these reactions, one has to employ alternative modelling methodology. spatially explicit individual-based simulations  explicitly describe the diffusive motion of each individual mrna and protein molecules and emulate the reaction steps of  as stochastic processes whenever the concerned reactants encounter in space along their respective random walk . just like for the mass action kinetics, each gene type i∈{ <dig> ,2} is present in gt copies. in agreement with previous models of the influence of diffusion on gene expression  <cit> , we assumed that the amplitude and speed of the gene displacements in space can be neglected compared to the mrna and protein, so in our simulations, the genes are immobile and only the mrnas and proteins move via brownian motion .

to set the positions of the 3gt genes in space, we compared three scenarios that correspond to various degrees of mixing : 
the uniform configuration corresponds to a perfect mixing of the genes: all 3gt gene copies are positioned at independent randomly-chosen locations.

the clustered configuration corresponds to a first case of demixing: gt gene triplets composed of one g <dig>  one g <dig> and one g <dig> gene are restricted inside non-overlapping subregions of space

the segregated configuration illustrates a different case of demixing: the  <dig> gene types i∈{ <dig> ,2} are segregated into  <dig> subregions of space, each subregion containing all the gt copies of a given type.



the degree of demixing of the genes can be continuously adjusted by setting the ratio r/r between the size of the local segregation subregions r and that of the total reaction space r. demixing is strong for r/r→ <dig>  but disappears when r/r→ <dig> 
figure  <dig> 
the spatial configuration of the genes may alter the dynamical regime . these time courses of the total number of proteins  in the reaction space were obtained using spatially-explicit stochastic individual-based simulations in 2d. the spatial configuration of the genes corresponded to the  uniform,  clustered  or  segregated  scenarios of figure  <dig>  the autocorrelation function for each of these three spatial configurations is shown in  . size of the spatial domain r= <dig>  g
t= <dig> copies. all other parameters were according to the standard set defined in the methods section.



the results of the 2d individual-based stochastic simulations for the segregated gene configuration with large demixing however show a strikingly different behavior . after a transient period, protein levels do not show evidence of oscillations any longer but reach a stationary level around which they fluctuate. in some cases, the stationary regime for one of the proteins can even correspond to a stably and completely repressed state . as a result, the dynamics consists of two proteins  fluctuating around a stationary level, while a third one  has vanished. we insist here on the fact that the only difference between the oscillatory regime in figure 3a-b and the stationary one in figure 3c are the spatial locations of the 5× <dig> immobile genes. all the other parameters  are identical. this is a major result of our paper: changing a purely spatial characteristics  is enough to change the system dynamics in a qualitative manner . since they do not include spatial characteristics, mass action kinetics cannot account for this kind of global change of dynamics. even worse, the dynamics illustrated in figure 3c cannot be predicted at all by mass action kinetics. indeed, according to mass action kinetics ), the only reachable regime consists in a stationary state in which the stationary quantities of protein pi are identical ∀i∈{ <dig> ,2} . in other words, the only accessible stationary state according to mass action kinetics should have p0=p1=p <dig>  whereas figure 3c evidences the existence of a stationary regime where p0=p1≫ <dig> and p2≈ <dig> 

to quantify the difference between those two regimes, we found that the first zero crossing of the acf is a very good quantifier. figure 3d shows the acf for the segregated case of figure 3c. this acf is typical of stochastic time series fluctuating around a stationary mean: it decreases very rapidly with the autocorrelation delay and is roughly devoid of subsequent oscillations. it is very easy to distinguish it from the acf of the uniform and clustered configuration that are typical of oscillating regimes, with large period. in particular the first zero crossing  is found much smaller in the stationary segregated configuration  than in the oscillatory uniform or clustered ones . in the following, the fzca will thus be used as a quantifier to distinguish between stationary regimes  and oscillating ones .

a bifurcation based on the spatial localization of the genes
the segregated and clustered configurations illustrated in figure  <dig> above correspond to high demixing . we then investigated how the observed effects depend on the degree of demixing.

t= <dig> copies. all other parameters were according to the standard set defined in the methods section.



here again the segregated scenario yields a very different picture . for large enough mixing , the dynamics remain oscillatory, with fzca values that are indistinguishable from the uniform case. for r/r< <dig> , though, the average fzca progressively decreases with increasing demixing, switching from oscillatory values  to values typical of stochastic fluctuations around a stationary state . the corresponding curve actually describes a bifurcation: as demixing crossovers the critical value c≈ <dig> , the dynamics undergoes a global  change from oscillatory to a stable stationary state. however, the bifurcation parameter here is not a kinetic parameter or density parameter, as usually the case, but a parameter related to the spatial locations of the genes. we refer to this behavior as a space-induced bifurcation.

in the results of figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the mrna have a finite lifetime of τm= <dig> mc steps. with infinite mrna and protein lifetimes, each protein molecule would be able to reach any gene position given enough time, yielding perfect mixing . one therefore does not expect to observe the spatial effects reported in figures  <dig> and  <dig> when the protein or mrna lifetimes diverge. figure 5a shows the fzca values obtained for different values of the mrna degradation rate . when the degradation rate vanishes , the fzca converges to a unique value , independently of the gene spatial configuration. this common regime  corresponds to an oscillatory regime for all the spatial configurations, even the segregated configuration with high demixing r/r→ <dig>  therefore, in the limit of very large mrna lifetimes, the observed regime is in agreement with the predictions of the mass action kinetics: an oscillatory regime that does not depend on the positions of the genes. the space-induced effects unveiled in figures  <dig> and  <dig> start to be significant when the spatial range of the mrnas τmd or proteins τpd  decreases. in other words, the oscillatory regime disappears when the distance between a given segregated gene cluster and the cluster of its repressive genes is too large compared to the mrna or protein spatial range, thus failing to yield efficient repression.the space-induced bifurcation depends on kinetics parameters . the average value of the first zero crossing of the acf  is reported as a function of the mrna degradation rate 1/τ

finally, figure 5b shows the fzca values obtained when the copy number of each gene  is varied. in the spatial configurations with large demixing , decreasing the number of genes does not qualitatively change the dynamics : even with a single copy of each gene type, the segregated configuration keeps stationary dynamics whereas the clustered one maintains its oscillatory regime . the behavior with the uniform configuration is more complex. by definition, with a unique copy of each gene , the uniform and segregated spatial configurations are identical. one the other hand, with standard parameters , the above results show that the dynamics of the uniform configuration is essentially identical to the clustered configuration. therefore, in the uniform configuration, one expects a transition from the oscillatory to the stationary regimes when the number of gene copy decreases from  <dig> to  <dig>  figure 5b shows that this transition occurs between gt= <dig> and gt= <dig>  for gt≤ <dig> copies the uniform spatial configuration display the stationary dynamics typical of the segregated configuration  whereas for gt≥ <dig>  the dynamics is oscillatory, similar to the clustered configuration.

taken together, those results show that with spatially explicit dynamics, the system still displays bifurcations when the kinetic parameters are varied. spatial parameters thus bring an additional dimension to the bifurcation diagrams, in addition to the kinetic ones.

space-induced bifurcation in three dimensions
in the above results, the movement of the reactants in the stochastic individual-based simulations occurred along a two-dimensional spatial domain. lattice-based simulations of brownian diffusion in two dimensions are less demanding in terms of computation cost than in three dimensions, thus permitting exploration of the parameter space with reasonable accuracy and sampling. however, compared to two dimensions, brownian diffusion in three dimensions has fundamentally different properties regarding how space is explored   <cit> . in this section, we show that the occurrence of space-induced bifurcation is robust to those changes in compacity and is preserved in three dimensional systems.

space-induced bifurcations are also observed in three dimensions. the average value of the first zero crossing of the acf  is reported as a function of the degree of demixing r/r

when the diffusion coefficient decreases, the dynamics in those 3d simulations exhibits two phases: for intermediate diffusion coefficients, i.e. d≳10− <dig> a.u. 2/mc time step  the regime remains oscillatory for all the gene configurations , but the period of the oscillations increases to recover the values observed for the oscillatory regimes in 2d above . when the diffusion coefficient decreases further , the behavior depends on the spatial configuration of the genes. with the clustered configuration, the oscillatory regime persists , at least in the limit of the values of d that we tested. with the uniform or segregated configurations however, the dynamics exhibit a qualitative change as d decreases below 2×10− <dig>  switching from an oscillatory regime  to a stationary one where all species fluctuate around a constant steady state . therefore, this is a further illustration that space-induced bifurcations are also observed in 3d when the spatial range decreases. in agreement with our 2d results above, the segregated configuration appears to be more sensitive than the uniform one: the oscillatory-stationary bifurcation seems to necessitate less reduction of the diffusion coefficient in the segregated configuration than in the uniform one. this observation is a further example that the dynamic regime in our system is strongly controlled by the gene positions in space.

discussion
our goal in this study was to investigate whether space can influence the temporal dynamics of repressilator circuits i.e. 3-gene repression-based transcriptional regulatory loops, that exhibit prototypical spontaneous oscillations in certain ranges of kinetic parameters . we used spatially-explicit stochastic individual-based modelling to simulate repressilator circuits in 2d and 3d, with various degrees of demixing of the gene positions in space. our main finding is that variations of some spatial parameters  can have dramatic effects on the system dynamics, switching it from the spontaneous oscillatory regime to a stationary regime where each species fluctuates around constant values. this effect is similar to the bifurcations along the kinetic parameters that are usually evoked to explain the appearance of the oscillatory regime in those systems. we thus referred to it as a space-induced bifurcation. our study therefore indicates that spatial parameters should be considered as additional bifurcation dimensions to the kinetic parameters to predict the dynamics of those systems. this conclusion strongly supports the idea that the spatial organization of the molecular actors of transcriptional networks is crucial for the dynamics of gene expression.

the possibility that the positions in space of the elements of intracellular biochemical systems may control their dynamics has already been suggested in previous works . in the specific case of the dynamics of gene expression, the study of the influence of space on the dynamics of the expression of an isolated gene has recently started to be explored with computational or theoretical approaches. the main conclusion was that diffusion of mrnas and proteins and the spatial correlations created by the coupling with reaction, can strongly increase the fluctuations of gene expression, i.e. noise  <cit> . our results is a significant advance in this problem since we consider gene networks , not a single isolated gene and we show that the alterations of the dynamics due to spatial parameters in those systems may be qualitative: beyond changing the mean value or the fluctuations, they may even alter the global regime of the dynamics .

from our simulation results, two major experimental predictions emerge concerning the dynamics of 3-gene repression-based transcriptional ring networks. if each of the  <dig> genes is present in a single copy , we expect the dynamics to be stationary in most cases, except if each of the repressor gene is located very close to its repressed target gene . in other words, we predict that spontaneous oscillations may be difficult to obtain in networks with a single copy of each gene. moreover, our study suggests that the spatial range of the proteins and mrnas, i.e. their kuramoto length , is a major determinant of the system dynamics. the precise location of the genes is likely to control the dynamics when the spatial range  is not too large. for large spatial ranges , the expected regime agrees with the prediction of mass action kinetics, i.e. spontaneous oscillations with the kinetic parameters we used. therefore, in vivo, space-induced bifurcations should be significant in systems where the lifetimes and/or the diffusion coefficient of the mrnas and/or proteins are limited.

estimating the spatial range of intracellular proteins in vivo is still a challenge for experimental biology. based on the measured diffusion coefficient of fus <dig> map kinase in the yeast  <cit>  or that of gfp in e. coli  <cit> , cottrell et al.  <cit>  obtained coarse estimates leading to the conclusion that cytoplasmic proteins should have spatial ranges that are much larger than the cell itself. this leads to the widespread opinion that the spatial distribution of cytoplasmic proteins in the cell is uniform . however, even in bacteria like e. coli, this idea is questionable. first, consistent recent experimental evidence suggest that many proteins adopt localized distribution inside the cell, in opposition to a well-mixed situation  <cit> . the molecular actors of gene expression in c. crescentus or e.coli may even present a very specific spatially-organized intracellular structure  <cit> , with, in particular, chromosomally-expressed mrnas that exhibit very low diffusion coefficients  <cit> . another recent and very symbolic example is laci, the repressor of the lac operon. direct measurements of the diffusion coefficient of laci in living e.coli cells indicate rapid diffusion  and consequently suggest a very large spatial range  <cit> . however, recent measurement of the steady-state distribution of laci inside living e.coli revealed that depending on the location of the laci gene on the bacterial chromosome, the distribution of the laci protein can either be homogeneous or highly inhomogeneous and mostly localized  <cit> . in fact, the diffusion of proteins and mrnas in living cells, even in simple and small cells like e.coli is far from a simple brownian motion. this may lead to violations of the hypotheses that underly coarse estimations of the spatial range. first, for macromolecules that interact with dna, the diffusion process itself is composite  because part of it occurs in 3d in the bulk and part of it as a restricted sliding movement along the dna molecule  <cit> . moreover the bacterial cytoplasm itself does not present the usual properties of a liquid. it is a complex, extremely crowded and dense medium that strongly protein and mrna mobility in a spatially non-homogeneous way  <cit> . how exactly those complex properties arise from the intracellular elements and how exactly they alter molecule mobility is still unclear  <cit> , but theoretical arguments indicate that such macromolecular crowding may strongly affect the dynamics of gene expression  <cit> . we conclude that, in spite of the rather large values measured for the diffusion coefficient of some proteins or mrnas, the physical nature of the cytoplasm is likely to considerably restrict the spatial range of proteins and mrnas. therefore, one would generically expect that space-induced bifurcations may be significant in living cells.

one possibility that we have left unexplored in the present work is that of an inverse transition: starting from a region in the parameter space where mass action kinetics predict a stable steady state , can oscillations be induced by manipulation of some spatial parameter? we first stress that the observed shunting down of oscillations resulting from spatial segregation is not exactly a return to the steady state of the mass action kinetics, since in the latter, all three proteins are predicted to be expressed in equal amounts whereas in the former, one of the proteins is often expressed at a much lower level than the others. in previous works  <cit> , we have showed that in the absence of bifurcation in the mass action kinetics, the unique equilibrium remains stable, globally and asymptotically. however, when a bifurcation does exist in the mass action kinetics approximation, the question remains open, especially when the parameters are very close to the bifurcation of the mass action kinetics system.

CONCLUSIONS
our model for gene expression is limited to the main processes implied in gene expression and is limited to a 3-gene network. we think that the basic mechanisms underlying space-induced bifurcations are simple enough that they should still be effective in other systems, in particular, in transcriptional regulation networks comprising larger numbers of gene types or positive regulation . likewise, we expect our conclusions to be robust to increasing molecular details and more realistic modelling of each subprocess . therefore, our results bring a strong support to the view that the spatial organization of the molecular actors of transcriptional networks is crucial for the dynamics of gene expression. in a synthetic biology perspective, they suggest that the spatial localisation of the synthetic genes should be factored out in the global strategy used to shape the dynamics of the synthetic network to be inserted in the cell.
