BACKGROUND
elucidating the higher phylogenetic relationships of pulmonate gastropods has remained difficult. a morphology-based phylogenetic analysis revealed a high level of homoplasy and resulted in a poorly-resolved tree  <cit> . molecular studies have been based on few individual genes, essentially 18s, 28s, 16s, and coi data  <cit> , or few complete mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .

analyses based on individual gene sequences all provide similar relationships   <cit> : pulmonates are monophyletic, but they include a few taxa not traditionally classified as pulmonates ; also, opisthobranchs are paraphyletic, basal to pulmonates; finally, the false limpet siphonaria, traditionally regarded as a pulmonate, is in some cases found to be more closely related to opisthobranchs than pulmonates. in recent years, taxon sampling has significantly increased in analyses utilizing individual genes: the largest data set  established so far includes  <dig> species representing all major taxa of pulmonates  <cit> .

analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes provide different phylogenetic relationships, at least for the deep nodes  <cit> : pulmonates are paraphyletic, basal to the monophyletic opisthobranchs; siphonaria is nested within the opisthobranchs. taxon sampling is still limited in analyses based on complete mitochondrial genomes, mainly because gastropod mitochondrial genomes are still difficult to obtain. since the first complete gastropod mitochondrial genome was published in  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> complete genomes have been made available . the use of shotgun sequencing and the decrease in sequencing costs caused a noticeable increase in the production of gastropod mitochondrial genomes a few years ago . ten genomes became available in nine different publications between  <dig> and 2006; since  <dig>   <dig> genomes became available,  <dig> of which appeared in only four publications  <cit> , although a few papers with only one genome were also published.

at present, opisthobranchia and neogastropoda  are the taxa for which the largest number of complete mitochondrial genomes are available, with  <dig> and  <dig> genomes, respectively . ten genomes are available for pulmonates , but only some of the pulmonate higher clades are represented. the taxon sampling for the other gastropods is either insufficient  or missing .

in the present study, we report  <dig> new, complete, mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates, with a special focus on lineages that were poorly or not sampled : salinator rhamphidia ; auriculinella bidentata, myosotella myosotis, ovatella vulcani, and pedipes pedipes ; peronia peronii ; siphonaria gigas ; succinea putris ; trimusculus reticulatus ; and rhopalocaulis grandidieri . here we also provide a set of  <dig> new, pulmonate-specific primers spanning the entire mitochondrial genome and specifically designed for the present study. these new primers were combined in multiple pairs, or with  <dig> mitochondrial primers previously published, to amplify genomes through simultaneous, short reactions. this direct approach was of great help for amplifying mitochondrial genomes in the present study. pulmonate relationships are evaluated through phylogenetic analyses based on these new genomes as well as  <dig> genomes published previously. the impact of this new data set on our understanding of the relationships and evolution of pulmonates is discussed.

RESULTS
genome structural features
the structural features of each of the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes sequenced in this study are summarized in table  <dig>  each genome consists of  <dig> protein-coding genes, two rrna genes, and  <dig> trna genes. the genomes vary in size from  <dig>   <dig> bp  to  <dig>   <dig> bp  with most in the range of  <dig>   <dig> bp. in all  <dig> genomes,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes are coded on the minus strand: trnq, trnl <dig>  atp <dig>  trnn, atp <dig>  trnr, trne, rrns, trnm, nad <dig>  trns <dig>  trnt, and cox <dig>  in succinea putris, trny and trnw are also coded on the minus strand, as well as trnh in siphonaria gigas. in the majority of the protein-coding genes , the start codon is ttg. alternatively, the start codon is either atg , gtg , att , ata , ctg , or tta . the stop codon is either taa , tag , t , or ta , none of which is used solely for a particular protein-coding gene.

total
the size of each genome and the por are in bp. start and stop codons for protein-coding genes are indicated in parentheses.

all  <dig> mitochondrial genomes have adjacent overlapping genes, typically  <dig> to  <dig> genes; the highest number  of overlapping genes is found in peronia peronii and the fewest number  is found in pedipes pedipes, which is likely correlated with genome size. the amount of overlap between genes is typically between  <dig> and  <dig> bp. only one pair of overlapping genes is common to all  <dig> mitochondrial genomes: trnk, cox <dig> . with the exception of pedipes pedipes, the other nine mitochondrial genomes all have nad <dig>  nad <dig>  overlapping and nad <dig>  nad <dig>  overlapping. the largest overlaps in adjacent genes are  <dig> bp between nad <dig>  trnk in succinea putris and  <dig> bp between nad4l, cob in auriculinella bidentata. the number of intergenic spacers range from four in peronia peronii to  <dig> in pedipes pedipes. the typical size of the intergenic spacers varies from  <dig> to  <dig> bp. a large intergenic spacer  is found in rhopalocaulis grandidieri between trns <dig>  trns <dig>  and another one  in ovatella vulcani between trnm, nad <dig>  of the  <dig> intergenic spacers found in pedipes pedipes, five of them are sizeable and at-rich:  <dig> bp between nad <dig>  nad <dig>   <dig> bp between trns <dig>  trnt,  <dig> bp between cox <dig>  trnq,  <dig> bp between trnr, trns <dig>  and  <dig> between nad <dig>  trni. an at-rich intergenic spacer between cox <dig>  trni is found in all  <dig> mitochondrial genomes, and this was determined to be the potential origin of replication  which concurs with previous findings  <cit> . due to gene rearrangements, the por for pedipes pedipes may be located between cox <dig>  trnq  or between nad <dig>  trni . the por of pedipes pedipes is likely adjacent to the start of cox <dig> for two reasons. first, the percentage of a+t in the  <dig> bp adjacent to cox <dig> is higher than the  <dig> bp adjacent to trni . second, a por adjacent to cox <dig> was previously found in other gastropod mitochondrial genomes  <cit> .

the  <dig> trnas for each of the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes were easily located, with the exception of trns <dig> in rhopalocaulis grandidieri. unlike the trns <dig> of the other nine mitochondrial genomes, the anticodon loop sequence is ctgctag instead of the typical ctgctaa and there are two base mispairings in the anticodon loop, which is also uncommon . all of the trns <dig> and trns <dig> genes lack the dhu stem.

molecular phylogeny
the trees from the ml and bayesian analyses share identical topologies and similar branch lengths and node support values . pulmonates form a paraphyletic group at the base of the euthyneura; pyramidella dolabrata, traditionally regarded as a basal heterobranch external to euthyneura, is nested within  pulmonates. siphonaria, traditionally regarded as a basal pulmonate, is nested within opisthobranchia which form a derived, monophyletic group at the tip of the euthyneuran tree. the veronicellid slug rhopalocaulis grandidieri is the most basal species of the euthyneurans, with high node support. freshwater snails biomphalaria glabrata and radix balthica form a clade emerging just after rhopalocaulis grandidieri. land snails succinea putris and albinaria coerulea form a clade emerging just after the freshwater snails. the ellobiids  are not monophyletic and are spread throughout the basal portion of the tree. however, the false limpet trimusculus reticulatus  is recovered as closely related to two ellobiids , which is strongly supported. the three species of onchidiids  form a highly-supported monophyletic group. salinator rhamphidia , traditionally regarded as a basal pulmonate , is not basal with respect to all pulmonates. within the clade opisthobranchia, ascobulla fragilis is found to be the most basal. au and sh tests performed indicate that other alternative hypotheses of monophyly  are rejected .

some nodes are strongly supported, with bayesian posterior probabilities of  <dig> and bootstrap values of 100%, such as the monophyly of opisthobranchs  and the monophyly of the clade including trimusculus and two ellobiids . some other nodes are still reasonably supported, although less strongly, with bayesian posterior probabilities of  <dig> and bootstrap values superior to 75%. however, four of the deeper nodes display no statistical support, with bayesian posterior probabilities less than  <dig>  and bootstrap values less than to 50%. those nodes, indicated as thin lines in figure  <dig>  should be regarded as unresolved polytomies, which directly affects the interpretation of the relationships .

genome organization and rearrangements
biomphalaria glabrata, salinator rhamphidia, trimusculus reticulatus, ovatella vulcani, auriculinella bidentata, peronia peronii, onchidella borealis, onchidella celtica share an identical mitochondrial genome organization . albinaria coerulea shares the same genome organization except that the position of trns <dig> and trns <dig> are switched and trns <dig> is inverted. the genome of the two freshwater snails radix balthica and biomphalaria glabrata differ in the location of five trnas . the genome of rhopalocaulis grandidieri differs in the location of seven trnas . the genome of succinea putris differs in the location of three trnas , with the latter two genes being coded on the minus strand instead of the plus strand. in pedipes pedipes, trnt, cox <dig> swapped with trns <dig>  nad <dig>  and trnq and trnr moved between these two swapped sets of genes. myosotella myosotis only differs from the most standard mitochondrial genome organization by the rearrangement of nad4l between cox <dig> and trny. the location of trny before cox <dig> is a unique and unusual feature of the mitochondrial genome of pyramidella dolabrata. other attributes, such as the location of atp <dig> prior to atp <dig> and the encoding of trng by the minus strand, are exclusive to pyramidella dolabrata.

the opisthobranch genomes only differ from the common mitochondrial genome arrangement in the position of trny, trnw, and trnc. the trnc is located between trnh and trnq in ascobulla fragilis, chromodoris magnifica, and berthellina ilisima, and between trnn and atp <dig> in aplysia californica, pupa strigosa, and hydatina physis. the organization of the genome of siphonaria gigas is more similar to the genome of opisthobranchs than pulmonates, which is also true for siphonaria pectinata despite some moderate rearrangements .

discussion
species diversity of the pulmonate gastropods is largely dominated by the land snails and slugs, or stylommatophora, which include at least  <dig>   <dig> species. however, less than five percent of the pulmonate species diversity is found in the ten other higher taxa, which are anatomically and ecologically very distinct from each other: amphiboloidea, ellobiidae, hygrophila, onchidiidae, otinidae, siphonariidae, smeagolidae, trimusculidae, veronicellidae, and williamiidae. the present contribution constitutes a significant increase in taxon sampling for complete mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates, especially regarding the non-stylommatophoran taxa : complete mitochondrial genomes of amphiboloids, trimusculids, veronicellids, and two ellobiid "subfamilies"  are presented here for the first time. as of today, complete mitochondrial genomes are unavailable for only three of the pulmonate higher taxa: otinidae , williamiidae , and smeagolidae .

the topology of the consensus tree produced by our phylogenetic analyses  is very similar to the trees obtained previously based on all protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genomes  <cit> : pulmonates are paraphyletic, at the base of euthyneurans ; opisthobranchs  are monophyletic, at the tip of the tree. pyramidella dolabrata, traditionally regarded as a basal heterobranch , is more closely related to pulmonates. biomphalaria glabrata is found here to be at the base of pulmonates  <cit>  instead of at a more derived position in the tree  <cit> .

the trees based on mitochondrial genomes  show some congruence with the trees based on individual genes -18s, 28s, 16s, coi . in particular, both data sets agree on some nodes that were unsuspected before, such as the close relationship of trimusculus reticulatus and ellobiids. however, both data sets also show some noticeable differences. this might be explained by the fact that some of the deeper nodes are poorly supported by the mitochondrial aa data set presented here . also, the taxon sampling differs greatly: nearly  <dig> species of pulmonates are included in a recent analysis using 18s, 16s, and coi sequences  <cit>  while only  <dig> complete mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates are available, including those generated in this study. below we discuss the impact of our phylogenetic results on our understanding of the evolution of pulmonate gastropods. in particular, we focus on the new insights and new questions raised by the addition of the  <dig> new mitochondrial genomes.

in the present results, the most basal lineage of all euthyneurans are the terrestrial, veronicellid slugs, represented here by one species, rhopalocaulis grandidieri . traditionally, veronicellidae has been classified in systellommatophora, along with onchidiidae and rathouisiidae  <cit> , although no synapomorphies could be found for systellomatophorans in cladistic analyses  <cit> . the representation of veronicellids in molecular analyses is recent, but trees based on individual gene sequences support the monophyly of systellommatophora   <cit> . a basal position of veronicellids with respect to other pulmonates was proposed based on morphology  <cit> . however, this result was based on problematic interpretations of the anatomy of systellommatophorans, such as the fact that they supposedly lack a pneumostome and a lung. if confirmed, a basal position of veronicellids could lead us to re-interpret their extremely reduced pallial cavity. however, additional mitochondrial genomes of veronicellids will be necessary for testing this new result, because a single genome might introduce a bias  in the analyses.

freshwater snails  are found to be among the most basal lineages, although their relationships with respect to stylommatophora , are unclear. however, the position of hygrophila is still quite unstable and does vary from one study to another  <cit> . for unclear reasons, our attempts to get new complete genomes of freshwater pulmonates failed , although we started with fresh material from  <dig> species).

a relatively basal position of stylommatophora with respect to other pulmonates was obtained in previous analyses based on mitochondrial genomes and individual genes   <cit> . many derived features characterize land snails and slugs, especially in the excretory and pulmonary systems, which are physiologically critical for life on land  <cit> . as a result, land snails and slugs have often been regarded as the most derived -and thus most recent - lineage of pulmonates. however, several of those derived features are autapomorphic  or potentially homoplasic   <cit> . a basal position of land snails and slugs supports solem's theory according to which stylommatophorans were the first pulmonates to emerge  <dig> mya  <cit> . although stylommatophorans are among the most basal pulmonates and euthyneurans here, their relationships with respect to freshwater snails  are unclear because of low node support.

the ellobiidae is a diverse taxon with about  <dig> species names available in the literature, although only  <dig> of them are likely to be valid. more importantly, ellobiidae is phylogenetically diverse because the  <dig> ellobiid genera are characterized by different combinations of plesiomorphic and derived characters  <cit> . as a result, no exclusive morphological synapomorphy can be found for ellobiids within the broader context of all pulmonates  <cit> . for many years, molecular analyses could not adequately test the phylogenetic status of ellobiids because of low taxon sampling  <cit> . however, ellobiids were found to be monophyletic in a recent molecular analysis based on a new, comprehensive data set including  <dig> ellobiid species   <cit> , suggesting that additional sequenced mitochondrial genomes might be needed to properly address the phylogenetic status of the ellobiidae, especially considering that two subfamilies  are still not represented.

although the phylogenetic status of ellobiidae remains problematic, analyses based on concatenated mitochondrial aa sequences and those based on individual genes  all agree that the false limpet trimusculus reticulatus is closely related to ellobiids   <cit> . trimusculus reticulatus also shares the same genome organization as several ellobiid species . this is a new result that had not been suggested using morphology. in fact, there is not any obvious anatomical feature that appears to be shared by trimusculus and ellobiids  <cit> . some features are found in ellobiids and trimusculus, but they are also found in many other pulmonates, such as the globineurons and a hypoathroid central nervous system  <cit> . another interesting result obtained here, as well as in recent analyses based on individual genes, is the close relationship between onchidiidae and some ellobiids . onchidiidae and ellobiidae were suggested to be classified together in the ellobioidea  <cit> , partly based on characters from the nervous system.

our present data  reject the geophila hypothesis  which is also not supported by other recent molecular data . morphological data supported the monophyly of geophila, mainly based on two synapomorphies, i.e., the loss of heterostrophy and the presence of eyes at the tip of the ocular tentacles  <cit> . both of these features might have evolved independently in stylommatophora, onchidiidae, and veronicellidae. the eupulmonata hypothesis sensu morton  also is rejected here  <cit> .

the present analyses confirm two important results from recent molecular studies   <cit> . first, amphiboloidea, traditionally regarded as one of the most basal lineages of pulmonates, is not basal, suggesting that their operculum  was acquired secondarily. second, the pyramidelloids, traditionally regarded as basal  heterobranchs, are now consistently found to be nested within pulmonates  <cit> . however, the pyramidelloids have always been difficult to classify. some past authors have even regarded them as opisthobranchs  <cit> . the fact that pyramidellids differ so much from other pulmonates may be related to the fact that they live submerged in the seawater .

finally, the present data confirm that siphonaria is more closely related to opisthobranchs than to pulmonates, although this relationship is much clearer with mitochondrial genomes than with individual genes   <cit> . more specifically, siphonaria appears to be most closely related to sacoglossans . for most of the 20th century, authors have classified siphonaria within pulmonata, mainly because they tend to live in the upper intertidal zone, exposed to the air for most of the day, unlike opisthobranchs, which all live submerged even when found in the intertidal zone. as a result, the pallial cavity of siphonaria has been interpreted as a pulmonary cavity and their gills as secondary gills. however, early anatomists had recognized the similarity of the pallial gill of siphonaria with that of cephalaspideans  <cit> , suggesting that they could be homologous  <cit> . the pallial gill of siphonaria was even sometimes referred to as a cephalaspidean gill  <cit> . siphonaria and opisthobranchs share another important feature, i.e., the production of a milky white substance  when irritated  <cit> , although defensive metabolites are also found in other pulmonates, such as onchidium  and trimusculus  <cit> . even the gene order of the mitochondrial genome of siphonaria gigas  supports an affinity with opisthobranchs.

the order of the protein-coding, rrna, and trna genes in mitochondrial genomes is known to be potentially informative for phylogenetics  <cit> . however, the genomes of pulmonate gastropods display limited informative variation because the organization of protein-coding and ribosomal genes is stable across euthyneurans . also, figure  <dig>  which places gene order in a phylogenetic context, suggests that species may share the same gene order because of convergence. indeed, the freshwater snail biomphalaria glabrata shares the same gene order as other distantly-related pulmonates represented here , but differs from the other freshwater snail represented here, radix balthica, for five trna genes. so, the gene order found in biomphalaria glabrata and other pulmonates likely is due to convergence, i.e., trna genes ended in identical positions through distinct but convergent series of rearrangements. the fact that the genomes of the two siphonaria species differ in the position of two protein-coding genes , which has been exceptionally observed in euthyneurans, supports the same idea that the gene order of the mitochondrial genome of a given species should probably not be used to extrapolate on the gene order of a whole lineage. in caenogastropods, rawlings and collaborators also demonstrated that two closely-related species of dendropoma can differ significantly in genome organization  <cit> . when additional genomes are available for each major lineage of pulmonate , it might become possible to determine a common gene order to each lineage, but it is not possible at this stage because of our still limited number of complete genomes. there is little doubt, however, that, as additional complete genomes become available in euthyneurans, we will discover an increased variability in euthyneuran gene order.

CONCLUSIONS
the present data constitute a significant increase in taxon sampling for complete mitochondrial genomes of pulmonates . however, despite these efforts, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of higher relationships of pulmonates. most of the deep nodes are still uncertain, mainly due to low support values as well as some incongruence between analyses based on different data sets , these two issues being obviously related . additional pulmonate genomes are needed, especially for the taxa for which no genome is currently available . euthyneuran relationships would also greatly benefit from the addition of new genomes of basal heterobranchs . being the most closely related taxa to euthyneurans, basal heterobranchs could help stabilize the topology within euthyneurans.

euthyneuran phylogenetics and, more broadly, molluscan phylogenetics are still based on limited data, at least compared with vertebrate or arthropod phylogenetic studies which may include more than  <dig> kb of sequence data. addressing some of the incongruence between trees based on individual genes  and those based on complete mitochondrial genomes in euthyneuran phylogenetics is a long-term goal that is beyond the scope of the present study. progress will obviously require increased taxon sampling, but, more importantly, new markers, especially given that, in some ways, using mitochondrial genomes is similar to analyzing one marker with many loci  <cit> . in the future, when the number and diversity of molecular sequences and taxon samples are increased, merging all data into a single data set may also help provide greater resolution.

meanwhile, we have to accept that our progress regarding euthyneuran phylogenetics will be slow. step by step, important discoveries are being made . some of the results obtained from recent molecular studies constitute new, major findings  <cit> . in particular, all data sets support close relationships between the false limpet trimusculus reticulatus and ellobiids. also, pyramidelloids, regarded for many decades as basal  heterobranchs, are nested within pulmonates. finally, the false limpets siphonaria, traditionally regarded as pulmonates, are closely related to the sacoglossan opisthobranchs; mitochondrial genomes strongly suggest that siphonaria is nested within the monophyletic opisthobranchia , while individual genes suggest that siphonaria and sacoglossans could be at the base of the monophyletic pulmonata . all those results reinforce the idea that opisthobranch and pulmonate phylogenetics and evolution should be studied together, as euthyneurans  <cit> .
