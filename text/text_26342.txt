BACKGROUND
the adaptation of cells to changing environments involves the regulation of gene expression and, in particular, of mrna levels, through changes in the rates of mrna synthesis and degradation. the regulation of mrna decay was recently shown to have a significant effect on mrna levels in response to changes in growth rate  <cit> . a number of molecular mechanisms regulating mrna stability and involving mrna-binding molecules  have been described. for example, the binding of the sugar transport-related srna sgrs, together with hfq and rnase e, is known to destabilize ptsg mrna  <cit> . csra protein increases the amount of flhdc transcript present in the cell, by preventing its degradation by rnase e  <cit> . riboswitches can either sequester or release rnase e cleavage sites, by triggering structural changes to the rna following the binding of small molecules, such as lysine for the lysc mrna  <cit> . the binding of ribosomes  to mrna has been reported to have a dual role, either preventing or accelerating bacterial mrna degradation  <cit> . these studies directly highlighted the role played by mrna sequence-related determinants, such as specific recognition sequences  <cit>  and secondary structures  <cit> , in the mechanisms regulating mrna lifetime. these mechanisms have been studied and described for particular transcripts and may be specific to the transcripts concerned. however, the global mechanisms determining mrna stability patterns relevant for the genome-wide regulation of mrna levels have yet to be studied and characterized. the large-scale datasets already available for mrna half-life and the development of “omics” methods have opened up new possibilities for discovering and characterizing global regulation patterns and their underlying mechanisms. however, only eight studies addressing the mechanisms determining mrna half-life at the genome-wide scale have been published. these studies concern escherichia coli  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , bacillus subtilis  <cit> , lactococcus lactis  <cit> , halobacterium salinarum  <cit> , bacillus cereus  <cit> , and mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit> . significant differences in results were reported between these analyses, which may have been due to inherent biological differences between the microorganisms studied and/or differences in the methods used for data collection and statistical analysis. for example, the effect of transcript length on mrna stability has been found to differ between microorganisms: with no effect of length observed in s. cerevisiae, b. subtilis, b. cereus, h. salinarum and m. tuberculosis, but a negative effect in l. lactis  <cit> . two analyses in e. coli yielded conflicting results, with one study reporting a negative effect  and the other no effect of length on mrna stability  <cit> . the effects of the various factors on mrna stability has been systematically studied by simple pairwise linear correlation analysis, regardless of the nature of these factors, making it impossible to rank them. furthermore, genome-wide parameters associated with mrna lifetime have generally been investigated only for a single set of growth conditions, despite the differences in mrna stability observed at different growth rates in e. coli  <cit> , m. tuberculosis  <cit>  and l. lactis  <cit> . it therefore remains unclear whether the mechanisms determining mrna stability can change and whether they are dependent on growth rate.

we carried out a genome-wide analysis of transcript lifetimes in the model bacterium, e. coli mg <dig>  at various growth rates. we used the largest  and the most recent mrna half-life datasets  available for this microorganism  <cit> . the half-lives ranged from  <dig> to 53 minutes and were shown to be dependent on growth rate  <cit> . however, the key factors responsible for this considerable variability of mrna stability remain unknown. we investigated the major parameters correlated with mrna stability, by modeling all mrna half-lives statistically, taking into account, without the a priori selection of parameters, both qualitative  and quantitative ) biological factors. this made it possible to rank the factors most strongly influencing growth rate-dependent mrna stability patterns. we found that the general parameters explained more than half the variability of mrna stability, even in the presence of mrna-specific regulation. the nature of the general parameters identified provides valuable insight into the genome-wide mechanisms associated with mrna stability. for example, mrna concentration, length and gc content are directly related to the activity of the degradation machinery; cai and a sequence motif are related to the translational activity of ribosomes and other parameters  are related to as yet unknown mechanisms. finally, we also investigated the role of mrna stability regulation in determining growth rate-dependent protein levels in cells, using new proteomic datasets for e. coli growing at different rates.

RESULTS
we used a linear covariance model to identify factors relating to mrna stability in e. coli. this analysis was based on large-scale mrna half-life datasets  <cit> , taking into account both quantitative  and qualitative  parameters . a previous study reported differences in the patterns of mrna stability regulation between growth rates  <cit> . we therefore decided to use four linear covariance models corresponding to different growth rates . for each model,  <dig> half-life values  were available: these datasets for mrna half-life are the largest ever used to identify mrna stability determinants. the most important parameters, selected on the basis of the akaike information criterion , are listed for each model in table  <dig>  this subset of parameters included both quantitative and qualitative parameters, reflecting intrinsic features  and extrinsic parameters dependent on the environment . the selection of these parameters resulted in a relatively good quality of fit for all four models, with determination coefficients  of between  <dig>  at μ =  <dig>  h− <dig> and  <dig>  at μ =  <dig>  h− <dig>  these results indicate that mrna stability is well accounted for by the selected parameters, particularly at the lowest growth rates .table  <dig>

we analyzed the relative contributions of the parameters and their dependence on growth rate, by considering only selected parameters with an associated p-value <  <dig>  to be significant indicators of mrna stability. significant indicators of mrna stability present in all four models were considered to be independent of growth rate; whereas a significant indicator present in at least one, but not in all the models was considered to be dependent on growth rate.

indicators of mrna stability independent of growth rate
seven significant indicators  were identified in all the models. their influences were quantified by estimating the coefficients of the linear covariance models . the most influential of the quantitative parameters was mrna concentration, in all models, with estimated coefficients below − <dig>  . the negative sign of these coefficients indicates that higher mrna concentrations in cells are associated with a shorter half-life, whereas lower mrna concentrations are associated with a longer half-life. the second most influential factor was cai, which had positive estimated coefficients of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . thus, a higher optimal codon content was associated with a longer half-life. cai is a well known determinant of protein level in e. coli  <cit> , as confirmed here , but its effect on mrna stability has only rarely been investigated. we found that only orf length  was systematically negatively correlated with mrna half-life . finally, there was a weak negative effect of the gc content of the 5′utr + orf on mrna stability .

transcript stability was significantly higher for essential genes  <cit>  than for non-essential genes, for all growth rates considered . three cog categories had significant estimated coefficients for all four models, indicating an influence of gene function on mrna half-life. the mrnas of genes belonging to categories  cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning and  translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis categories were more stable than the other mrnas, whereas the mrnas of genes from category  lipid transport and metabolism category were less stable than the other mrnas.

the mrnas of genes from operons containing three genes  were significantly less stable than those of genes belonging to operons containing  <dig> genes , suggesting that cistron stability was higher for longer operons, at all growth rates. we investigated the possible link between cistron stability and position in the operon, by comparing the stability of the first cistron with all cistrons until the last one, for all operons for which all the necessary stability data could be collected . we found that, for each growth rate, the median half-life of a cistron increased with its rank in the polycistronic mrna. a representative example is shown, for operons with four cistrons, in figure  <dig>  the last cistron was, on average,  <dig>  times more stable than the first cistron, in at least 62% of the operons studied . these data suggest that, globally, the cistrons furthest from the 5′-end of the transcript are the most stable.figure  <dig>

we also looked for sequence motifs potentially related to mrna stability at different growth rates. we used rmes software  <cit>  to assess the overrepresentation of all possible five-base long motifs in the experimentally demonstrated 5′utr regions  of the top 25% and the bottom 25% of mrnas ranked in terms of stability, at four growth rates . rmes scores of exceptionality were computed for each motif and compared between the unstable and stable mrnas . the plots obtained for all the four growth rates indicated a strong correlation of motif exceptionality scores between stable and unstable mrnas: most of the motifs were located nearby the diagonal  line. nevertheless, we identified two sequence motifs overrepresented in the stable mrnas but less or not in the unstable mrnas. these motifs were located at the right side of the vertical blue line and at some distance from the diagonal line. at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h− <dig>  the aggag motif was found significantly more frequent in the 5′utr of stable mrnas than in the ones of unstable mrnas . at  <dig>  and  <dig>  h− <dig>  a second motif cuggc was significantly overrepresented in the 5′utr of stable mrnas compared to the 5′utr of unstable mrnas . we validated these observations, by comparing the half-life distributions for the whole mrna population having an experimentally demonstrated 5′utr region and for the different subpopulations of these mrnas including the two candidate motifs in the 5′utr . the subpopulation of transcripts with the aggag motif in their 5′utr was found more stable than the entire mrna population and this was more pronounced as the growth rate increased. at the low growth rates , the subpopulation of transcripts including the cuggc motif in the 5′utr was globally stabilized. the aggag motif was mostly located in the shine-dalgarno region , with no other “hot spot” region identified in the 5′utr, even when the motif was repeated two times. the cuggc motif, which could be repeated as much as three times in some sequences, did not occur at specific positions and was randomly located in the 5′utr.figure  <dig>

the secondary structure of the 5′utr has been reported to affect the decay of specific mrnas by impeding access to the rnase  <cit> . against expectations, the z score of the folding energy in the −30/+24 bp region of mrna was not identified as a general indicator of mrna stability in any of the models. we investigated the relationship between mrna stability and z score, by comparing the stability of the mrnas displaying the lowest z scores  with that of the other transcripts . no significant difference in mrna half-life distribution was found between the two groups. thus, potential mrna secondary structure in the −30/+24 bp region of the mrna was not predictive of stability at the genome-wide level.

changes in mrna stability indicators with growth rate
the significance of several parameters associated with mrna stability was dependent on growth rate. four cog categories were significant from μ =  <dig>  to  <dig>  h− <dig> but not at  <dig>  h− <dig> . by contrast, three cogs became significant only at μ =  <dig>  h− <dig>  at low growth rates, the mrnas of genes belonging to categories  coenzyme transport and metabolism and  intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport were more stable, whereas transcripts from categories  cell motility and  secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport and catabolism were more unstable than the average for the total transcript population. at high growth rates, mrnas from categories  carbohydrate and  nucleotide transport and metabolism were more stable than the average for the other transcripts, whereas mrnas from category  amino acid transport and metabolism had shorter half-lives. these findings are entirely consistent with a previous study highlighting the contribution of changes in mrna stability at high growth rates to control of the expression of genes involved in the central pathways of carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism  <cit> . the regulation of mrna stability varies with gene function, and, for the functional categories described above, with growth rate. the transcripts encoding outer membrane lipoproteins were more stable than the other transcripts only at μ =  <dig>  and  <dig>  h− <dig>  this finding is difficult to interpret.

in each of the four models corresponding to different growth rates, mrna concentration was the factor with the strongest influence but its coefficient decreased slightly with increasing growth rate, suggesting a smaller influence of mrna levels on mrna half-life at higher growth rates. we investigated the direct correlation between mrna concentration and stability in more detail, by plotting the degradation rate constant k /t1/2) as a function of concentration for all transcripts, at the four growth rates . the data were indeed found to be more dispersed at higher growth rates. nevertheless, for a given mrna concentration, the rate of degradation generally increased with growth rate. thus, independently of mrna levels, cells were more able to degrade mrna at higher growth rates. this may reflect the involvement of other factors, such as an increase in the expression of the degradation machinery with increasing growth rate  <cit> . it may also account for the weaker influence of mrna concentration on mrna stability at high growth rates.figure  <dig>

and mrna concentration. boxplot distributions of the degradation rate constant k as a function of log <dig> mrna concentration  are shown for the four growth rates μ =  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h− <dig> . the numbers of mrnas in the different box plots are indicated in brackets above each box.



relationship between mrna stability and protein level
we investigated the influence of mrna stability on protein levels in e. coli, by carrying out proteomic analyses for the different growth rates  and using new linear covariance models to account for the proteomic results. in addition to the parameters used in the models for half-life, we considered mrna half-life, the grand average of hydropathicity  and the percentages of each amino acid in the protein as explanatory variables. as mrna concentration and stability were strongly correlated, we did not include mrna concentration in the models.

the adjusted r <dig> values for protein concentration determination models including mrna half-life data were about  <dig> , and were similar to those of models excluding mrna half-life data . the correlation between mrna stability and protein level was therefore weak. however, in models including mrna half-life data, this parameter was selected on the basis of the aic at μ =  <dig>  h− <dig> and μ =  <dig>  h− <dig> . the estimated coefficients were significant but small, with opposite signs at the two growth rates . these data suggest that the weak correlation between mrna half-life and protein level may be dependent on growth rate. the low impact of mrna stability on protein level and the sign inversion at high growth rate were quite surprising because  protein level and mrna concentration were strongly positively correlated for  <dig> mrna and protein pairs in this dataset  and  mrna concentration and half-life were strongly negatively correlated . this intriguing finding may be accounted for by the  <dig> mrnas used in the protein determination models being not entirely representative of the larger set of  <dig> mrnas used in the mrna half-life determination models, as shown by the non-overlapping densities of mrna levels for the two datasets . nevertheless, our models confirmed the significant positive effect of cai on protein level    <cit> . indeed, cai, which is related to translation efficiency, has frequently been shown to have a strong positive influence on protein concentration  <cit> .table  <dig>

discussion
we used the largest and most recent mrna half-life datasets for e. coli and a large number of parameters in linear covariance models, to identify and rank the general parameters associated with mrna stability at four different growth rates. the determination coefficients  of the four models corresponding to the different growth rates were high , indicating that a large proportion of mrna stability could be explained by a combination of the selected general parameters. this finding highlights the importance of general mechanisms for the regulation of mrna stability. the general parameters correlated with mrna lifetime can be grouped according to the regulatory mechanisms involved.

the first group of parameters associated with mrna stability includes parameters directly related to the activity of the degradation machinery and, particularly, rnase e activity. we found that mrna concentration was the main indicator of mrna half-life and was negatively correlated with mrna lifetime. the most concentrated mrnas are therefore the least stable, consistent with a previous suggestion that mrna degradation generally tends to counterbalance transcription  <cit> . this counterintuitive hypothesis has also been put forward for other bacteria  <cit> . it can be explained by high mrna concentrations leading to a higher probability of encountering rnases, resulting in a shorter half-life of the mrna. furthermore, we showed, by analyzing the degradation rate constant as a function of growth rate, that the ability of cells to degrade mrna increased with increasing growth rate. this is consistent with the hypothesis proposed above, because expression of the degradation machinery is generally upregulated and total mrna concentrations are higher at high growth rates  <cit> . generally, mrna levels need to be compatible with the constraints of the growth conditions. the rapid turnover of highly expressed messengers is probably required for the rapid adaptation of cell physiology in a changing environment.

the weak but significant negative correlation between orf length and mrna half-life is consistent with the widely held view that endonucleolytic attack by rnase e is the rate-limiting step in mrna degradation and that the cleavage sites used in the alternative direct entry pathway are evenly distributed along the length of the transcript  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out the possibility that mechanical damage renders long mrnas less stable than short ones  <cit> . furthermore, we showed that, for most polycistronic mrnas, a greater distance of the cistron from the 5′-end is associated with higher stability, consistent with the findings of selinger and coworkers  <cit> . however, we also provide the first demonstration that this phenomenon is independent of growth rate. these results are entirely consistent with the current model of 5′ to 3′ mrna degradation initiated via the 5′ end-dependent rnase e endonucleolytic pathway  <cit> .

studies with a model rna showed that rnase e had a preference for au-rich regions  <cit> . however, an association of au-rich motifs and gc content in the 5′utr with mrna stability has never been definitively demonstrated at the whole-genome level  <cit> . our linear models show that there is a negative correlation between gc content and half-life values, but only for the complete 5′utr + orf sequence, not for the 5′utr or orf considered alone. we therefore confirm the absence, at genome-wide level, of a correlation between the gc content of the 5′utr and transcript stability. our results differ slightly from those of lenz and coworkers, who described a negative correlation between gc content and mrna half-life, but only for the orf  <cit> . these authors showed that the correlation between gc content and half-life values was not simple, instead varying along the length of the mrna molecule. this may explain why this parameter was not identified as having an influence on mrna stability. given that the formation of secondary structures is often linked to gc content, it is not surprising that the z score for the folding energy of the − <dig> / +24 bp region of the mrna was not identified as a parameter affecting mrna stability in any of the models. we also suggest that the g/c-rich motif cuggc, located in the 5′utr region, stabilizes mrnas at low growth rates.

the second group of parameters associated with mrna stability includes parameters directly related to ribosome activity and, thus, translation. surprisingly, we found that cai was positively correlated with mrna half-life. this observation is not consistent with the simple negative correlation of trna adaptation index  and half-life reported for e. coli  <cit>  but is consistent with results for l. lactis  <cit> . a high cai is believed to reduce ribosome pausing, thereby leading to efficient elongation of the translation product  <cit> . given the well known protective effect of ribosomes against rnase attacks  <cit> , we suggest that efficient translation elongation, leading to the continuous, rapid movement of the ribosome along the mrna, is likely to impede the interaction of nucleases with their substrate, thereby protecting mrna against degradation. a second hypothesis potentially accounting for these findings makes use of the opposite idea: a deleterious effect of ribosomes on mrna stability due to their ability to recruit the rna degradosome  <cit> . in the presence of a high cai, rapid translation would result in only a small number of ribosomes binding to each messenger. this would lead to fewer degradosome complexes being recruited per mrna molecule, thereby increasing mrna stability. we also observed that the aggag motif located in the ribosome binding site was associated with greater mrna stability. this supports the hypothesis of a protective effect of ribosomes against mrna degradation.

other parameters related to mrna stability were identified in this study, but the mechanisms by which these parameters affect mrna half-life are unknown. these new parameters were linked to gene functions probably dependent on cell physiology requirements and bacterial adaptation. transcripts from functional categories relating to growth, such as categories  cell cycle control, cell division, chromosome partitioning and  translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, were significantly more stable than the average at all growth rates. as mrna stability determines the time for which a transcript is accessible for translation, the rate of decay of these growth-related mrnas is probably kept low, to ensure that basal levels of these mrnas are present. this hypothesis is supported by our demonstration that essential genes have significantly longer mrna half-lives than other genes. similarly, the stability of the cistrons of long operons was greater than that of the cistrons of shorter operons. given that operons are often considered to be functional structures, the stability of these cistrons is probably programmed to satisfy the requirements for the functions of the products they encode, as demonstrated in yeast  <cit> . moreover, the half-lives of mrnas for some functional categories were specifically regulated at certain growth rates. for example, the stabilization of transcripts from functional categories such as  carbohydrate and  nucleotide transport and metabolism at the highest growth rate may support higher rates of metabolism  <cit> . taken together, these data suggest that the functional genomics findings probably reflect the specific regulation of mrna stability according to the role of the gene concerned in cell physiology and adaptation.

our linear covariance models had high determination coefficients, but the values obtained were always lower than  <dig>  this indicates that other factors not investigated here are also involved in mrna half-life determination. furthermore, as r <dig> decreased with increasing growth rate, these uninvestigated parameters made a greater contribution at higher growth rates. these parameters remain to be identified, but they may be related to rna-binding proteins, riboswitches and srnas with growth rate-dependent effects  <cit> .

finally, we showed that the contribution, at the genome-wide scale, of mrna stability to protein levels was small, whatever the growth rate considered. a significant but small correlation between mrna half-life and protein abundance was previously reported in e. coli  <cit> . this result highlights the complexity of protein level regulation, which involves other complex and highly regulated processes, such as translation and protein turnover, in addition to mrna stability and transcription.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we identified general parameters associated with mrna stability, using half-life measurements obtained for all the mrnas of e. coli at different growth rates. we provide, for the first time in e. coli, a ranking of these parameters in terms of their level of influence on mrna stability. this study made it possible to generalize certain features previously correlated with stability for particular mrnas, such as orf length and translatability, to the entire population of transcripts, thus demonstrating their importance. however, such generalization was not possible for all the expected parameters and we also identified new parameters influencing mrna stability that were not anticipated. in particular, mrna concentration was identified as the main factor correlated with mrna stability. there was an unexpected strong negative correlation between mrna concentration and stability , indicating that more abundant mrnas are degraded more rapidly. it would now be interesting to apply this genome-wide analysis of transcript lifetimes systematically to other microorganisms  to determine the organism-specificity of mrna stability indicators and to address the question of the differences in mrna degradation mechanisms between microorganisms.
