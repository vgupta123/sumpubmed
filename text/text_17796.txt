BACKGROUND
neuroblastoma  is one of the most common pediatric solid tumors, and accounts for 7–10% of all childhood cancers. the prognosis of patients with nb varies according to the stage, age and mycn amplification status. stage  <dig> disease is essentially curable, whereas patients with stage  <dig> disease, in particular those with mycn amplification, remain largely incurable despite advances in cancer therapeutics  <cit> . genomic alterations in nb have been investigated by cytogenetic, and molecular methods including spectral karyotyping and metaphase comparative genomic hybridization   <cit> . based on these studies several genomic alterations have been reported to correlate with prognosis including amplification of the mycn oncogene   <cit> , gains of 17q  and loss of 1p <dig>   <cit> . other recurrent changes including losses of 3p, 4p, 9p, 11q, and 14q, as well as frequent gain of chromosome  <dig> have also been suggested to have relevance to the development and progression of these tumors  <cit> .

recently array-based cgh  on bac and cdna microarrays has been used to investigate the genomic alterations with high resolution  <cit> . cdna a-cgh has been successfully utilized to detect amplification and to investigate the direct effects of genomic changes over gene expression level by using the same microarray for both a-cgh and gene expression analysis  <cit> . in this study, we applied a-cgh, on cdna microarrays containing  <dig>  elements, to systematically identify common aberrant genomic alterations in nb of various stages. we have applied a probabilistic approach to detect single-copy losses and gains of chromosomal regions. our study has three principal aims: 1) detection and high resolution mapping of amplicons in nb. 2) detection of low copy number genomic alterations using a probabilistic approach. 3) establishing a map of genomic imbalances in nb profiling samples with good  and poor  prognosis.

RESULTS
amplicon mapping by a-cgh
totally around  <dig>  qualified array cdna clones were applied for data analysis in  <dig> nb cell lines and  <dig> nb primary tumor samples . fig.  <dig> shows the number of clones as well as the average spacing for each chromosome. we first determined the sensitivity of a-cgh to detect the copy number of highly amplified genes. we here chose mycn since it is the most commonly amplified gene in nb and correlates with the biological behavior of these tumors. fig. 2a shows the linear regression plot of the mycn amplification results from a-cgh and quantitative-pcr . we found that the slope of the fitting line was  <dig> , and therefore an observed ratio of  <dig> by a-cgh corresponds to q-pcr ratio of ~ <dig>  in order to identify the amplified regions, we initially selected genes with a-cgh ratio ≥ <dig> for at least two contiguous clones in genome sequence order. only two chromosomes  showed amplifications by this criterion exclusively in the mycn amplified samples. focusing on 2p , we found  <dig> independent non-contiguous amplicons . for the mycn amplicon, the largest contiguous region was  <dig>  mb and bounded by nag and an est  in three tumor samples, whilst the smallest region was  <dig> kb including an est , ncym, and mycn. we identified  <dig> previously reported co-amplified genes   <cit> , and detected the novel amplification of several known genes  and ests. three of the cell lines  contained two amplicons in 2p13- <dig>  the first  included previously reported amplified gene meis <dig>  and the size of the second amplicon was  <dig>  mb , which was bounded by loc <dig> and tem <dig>  in addition to chromosome 2p, we identified another amplicon on 12q14-q <dig> in a single tumor ; bounded by pro <dig>  and rab3ip  containing one previously reported amplified gene   <cit>  as well as several novel amplifications  . we verified the amplification of nse <dig>  nag, ddx <dig>  mycn and tem <dig> by q-pcr . simultaneous gene expression profiling by using the same cdna arrays for all samples showed that 47% of the amplified genes correlate with gene expression .

detection of low-level dna copy number alterations
to test the sensitivity of a-cgh to detect single copy number changes, we performed a-cgh with dna from cell lines containing different numbers of x chromosomes   <cit>  and compared them to a sample with  <dig> copies of x chromosomes. the observed mean fluorescence ratio of all clones across x chromosome was calculated . for single copy deletions we observed an a-cgh ratio  <dig>  . the regression slope was  <dig> , similar to that for the mycn above . the underestimation of the expected ratio by a-cgh demonstrated that it is difficult to detect single-copy changes using pre-set threshold-based approaches.
significance according to the p-value shown in the color scale.

in order to increase the sensitivity for detecting low copy number changes, we applied a probabilistic approach utilizing t-statistics and the local genomic sequence mapping information of each of the cdna clones on our arrays. to validate our method, we re-analyzed the a-cgh data generated from the cell lines containing 1– <dig> copies of the x chromosome as described above, and we were able to detect a single copy loss and gain of x chromosome where the expected ratio was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . in addition, we used the reported results from the literature as an independent validation. the cell line sk-n-as is deleted within 1p <dig> -p <dig> , which has been investigated by fish and southern blot analysis  <cit> . the proximal sk-n-as deletion breakpoint was mapped to between nppa and plod, while the distal breakpoint is proximal of cdc2l <dig>  the deletion detected by our method is bordered by kiaa <dig> and ctnnbip <dig>  which is within the region reported. they are in a very good accordance. in addition, we also compared the 17q gain results for four nb cell lines  with the results in literature by fish and q-pcr  <cit> . our results confirmed the gains in 17q for all  <dig> cell lines and the loss in 17p in sk-n-as detected by fish.

we next analyzed the a-cgh data using this method to detect genome-wide alterations of dna copy number in our nb samples. using this t-statistics, we identified dna copy number alterations that involved the majority of the chromosomes in both primary tumors and cell lines . we confirmed previously reported genomic changes, including gains of whole chromosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and losses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 14; partial gains of 1q, 2p, 11p, 12q and 17q; partial losses of 1p, 3p, 4p, 9p, 11q and 14q  <cit> . the most common changes were losses on chromosome 1p,  <dig> and 11q; gains on 2p,  <dig>  and 17q.

stage specific genomic alterations
in order to identify the recurrent regions of genomic alterations that are specific to stage and mycn amplification status, we partitioned the tumors into three subgroups  and amplified ), and analyzed the frequency of genomic changes at each sw-locus  for each subgroup. since cell lines may contain tissue culture related genomic alterations, we only used primary nb tumor samples for this analysis. the frequency of alterations for a given sw-locus was estimated using the average probability  value as described in the methods. fig.  <dig> shows the graphic depiction of the p associated with each sw-locus for all possible pair-wise comparisons among the three subgroups for gains or losses: stage  <dig> vs. 4-, 4+ vs. 4- and  <dig> vs. 4+. as expected, since the majority of the loci show no change, they were plotted to values of co-ordinates around  . regions altered in both classes with similar frequency are plotted close to the y = x diagonal, whilst off-diagonal points represented regions primarily altered in one or the other of the classes . loci that plot around  reflect loci altered in both groups . the colored points were selected by using our criterion for "common" and "specific" sw-locus . in summary, we found alterations that were common to all three subgroups, which included gain of 7q <dig>  17q <dig>  17q23- <dig> and loss of 3p <dig>  we also found genomic imbalances that were specific for each of the subgroups and common regions of gain for stage  <dig> and 4- tumors. of note there were no shared alterations of 4+ with  <dig> or 4- besides the regions common to all. a detailed description and map positions for all these recurrent regions are provided in the table  <dig>  and a graphic representation of these imbalances is shown in fig.  <dig>  where we will discuss in detail in the discussion section.

discussion
amplicons in neuroblastoma
in our study we found that unlike breast cancers  <cit>  nbs do not have a wide variety of different amplicons or amplified genes. we identified  <dig> independent amplicons on 2p and one on 12q and precisely defined boundaries for all amplicons. several genes related to angiogenesis and oncogenesis were in these novel amplified regions including tem <dig> , mapped to 2p <dig> , which has been shown to have elevated expression during tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . indeed this gene was recently reported to be amplified in the cell line imr- <dig> in accord with our data  <cit> . the gene is expressed in human endothelium and has been implicated in colorectal cancer. our present study showed tem <dig> was amplified and over-expressed  in several neuroblastoma cell lines. the significance of amplification of tem <dig> in neuroblastoma cell lines but not endothelial cells raises an intriguing possibility that these tumor cells themselves contribute to the angiogenic process and requires further investigation. we also identified amplification of gas <dig>  mapped to 12q14-q <dig> in one tumor sample. gas <dig>  a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed with the highest expression in human brain, was previously shown frequently amplified in human gliomas  <cit> . alk  receptor, an oncogene and reported highly expressed in neuroblastoma  <cit> , was identified to be amplified in two of our tumor samples. in addition to these genes, most of those newly identified amplified genes have not been implicated previously in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and progression; therefore a further characterization of these genes might provide the biological insights to neuroblastoma biology. interestingly, all amplicons occurred in mycn amplified samples, and we have not found a single amplicon in mycn single copy samples.

additionally, using our search criterion  we found no evidence of amplifications in other chromosomal regions. this was in conflict with a study by satito-ohara et al. who found evidence of high level gains  <dig> nb cell lines and amplification as evidenced by a homogeneous staining region  in one line  <cit> . this difference could be explained by potential artifacts that arise in cell lines in tissue culture or be as a result of under detection by our study because of the relatively small number of tumor samples in our study, and would require confirmation in a larger sample set.

detection of low level of genomic changes
in this study, we have applied a t-statistics-based method to explore genomic alterations in cancer from data generated by a-cgh on a cdna microarray platform. our method efficiently dealt with the low sensitivity of cdna microarrays to detect low copy changes. the microarrays we utilized contain  <dig>  clones, containing around  <dig>  unique unigene clusters with an average coverage of one cluster every  <dig> kb. underestimation of dna copy number ratios by cdna a-cgh data made it difficult to detect low level of gains and losses using ratio threshold based approaches, which was addressed in our study and previous reports  <cit> . the algorithm we have implemented included an efficient noise reduction strategy by combining ratios within a sliding window of clones as has been previously described  <cit> . however the incorporation of t-statistics demonstrated several advantages over the sole reliance of moving average for detecting genomic changes. it provides confidence levels for detecting genomic changes at each dna location  in terms of p-values. this has theoretical advantages over the original raw ratio, because it incorporates an estimate of possible statistical errors in the analysis by giving a p-value attached to each genomic change within a sw-locus. by this method we were able to detect  <dig>  fold changes of gene copy number as shown in our x-chromosome validation experiment.

however, all these advantages are traded for a loss of resolution: genomic imbalances much smaller than the window-size cannot be detected and the boundaries of instable regions are blurred. therefore we should choose the smallest window that has the desired level of statistical significance. the effective resolution can be obtained by analyzing the correlation of overlapping sliding windows. the integrated autocorrelation time is an estimator of the minimal distance for windows to be effectively uncorrelated  <cit>  even when they overlap. for the sliding window t-test in our algorithm this distance can be calculated to be half the window size w, thus the number  of total unique unigene clusters is reduced to 2n/w for the effectively independent measurements of the dna copy number. our results indicate that a window size  <dig> is needed in order to detect the lowest possible dna change  with reasonable statistical significance. according to the discussion above, this window size reduces the approximately  <dig>  quality filtered unique unigene clusters to  <dig> *  <dig> / <dig> =  <dig> independent estimates. this resolution is comparable to typical bac arrays. for the stronger signals, less noise reduction is required. to detect 2-copy number dna changes, only a small window size  <dig> is needed, therefore the resolution will be  <dig> fold higher. although cdna a-cgh is known not as sensitive as bac a-cgh for the detection of low level of dna copy number changes, currently we are able to obtain the comparable detection by using the probabilistic approach. in addition, with cdna array it is possible to identify genomic amplification at the gene level and investigate the direct effect of gene copy number change over gene expression level in parallel, which will be addressed in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we explored the genomic alterations in nb from the data generated by a-cgh on a cdna microarray platform. we have not found genomic alterations universally present in all  three subgroups of nbs, although such a region would be interesting since it may harbor specific genes that are uniquely responsible for nb tumorigenesis. we therefore focused on commonly altered regions where >70% of tumors showed changes in a given region, for our three different subgroups . we found only a few of imbalances occurring in all three subgroups, of which gain of 17q21- <dig> and loss of 3p <dig> have been previously described in nb biology  <cit> . apart from these regions stage 4+ tumors did not have any other regions that commonly change with the other two stages, whereas stages  <dig> and 4- had several common alterations. stage 4- tumors demonstrated several unique changes of which losses in 11q has been previously described in mycn single copy nb  <cit>  and acts as a possible marker of unfavorable phenotype independent of mycn amplification  <cit> . remarkably stage 4+ disease appears to have very few genomic alterations when compared with stage  <dig> and 4- implying that mycn amplification is sufficient to drive these tumors to an aggressive phenotype, and although other genomic changes occur, including loss of 1p <dig> as shown by us and others  <cit> , it does not require extensive changes. this is in agreement with the murine mycn transgenic model of nb where the mycn transgene itself is enough for tumor development, but these tumors develop additional genomic changes characteristic of nb  <cit> .

based on these results we found that cdna a-cgh analysis is an efficient method for the detection and characterization of amplicons. we confirmed the previously reported amplified genes and also identified novel amplifications in neuroblastoma. furthermore our probabilistic approach allows the detection of single copy number changes from cdna a-cgh and can be applied to other cgh platforms including bac or oligonucleotides based arrays.
