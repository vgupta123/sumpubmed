BACKGROUND
anti-thymocyte globulin , trade name thymoglobulin®, has been employed for decades as an immune modulator for a variety of clinical indications. it is currently one of the most common immunosuppressive reagents used in allogeneic transplantation  <cit>  and more recently, in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune disorders  <cit> . there is a common belief that atg therapy functions through complement mediated depletion of mature t cells. however, recent data suggests that atg therapy induces immune modulation beyond that of simple t cell depletion  <cit> . for example, atg therapy may facilitate tolerance induction through modulation of dendritic cells , both phenotypically and functionally  <cit> . evidence has also shown that atg therapy may also induce regulatory t cells  in vivo  <cit> . however, it remains unclear how atg therapy affects naive and memory t cells in autoimmune settings such as t1d, although a recent study suggested that atg therapy effectively eliminates alloantigen specific memory t cells in an allogeneic transplantation mouse model  <cit> . in the current study, we used both standard nod mice, as well as a tcr transgenic form of these mice  to investigate changes within immune cell subsets in peripheral blood, spleen and lymph nodes post-atg therapy, specifically focusing on addressing the questions of how atg therapy affected naive and memory t cells, including naïve and memory tregs. these strains were utilized due to their common utilization in studies of murine atg efficacy for type  <dig> diabetes, as well as the ability to utilize mice having a defined antigenic specificity. the results demonstrated that atg therapy differentially depletes t cells from peripheral blood and lymphoid organs. atg therapy was more efficient in depleting naïve t cells than memory t cells. tregs appeared resistant to atg depletion and their frequency remained at increased levels after homeostatic recovery from atg therapy. it was also noted that proportionately tregs with memory t cell phenotype were significantly increased post-atg therapy. taken collectively, we believe this is a previously unrecognized mechanism whereby atg therapy differentially affects naïve and memory tregs.

RESULTS
atg therapy efficiently depletes t cells from peripheral blood, but is less efficient in depleting t cells from lymphoid organs
it is known that atg therapy can largely eliminate t cells from peripheral blood. however, it was of interest to learn to what extent atg eliminated t cells from lymphoid organs. our kinetic observation of peripheral blood cells post-atg therapy revealed that both the cd4+ and cd8+ t cells dropped to their lowest levels at day  <dig> post-atg therapy and by day  <dig>  peripheral blood cd4+ t cells returned to normal levels. in contrast, whereas cd8+ t cells were shown to recover, they remained significantly lower than at baseline by day  <dig> . based on the kinetic changes of blood t cells above, in subsequent experiments, we compared cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in peripheral blood and spleen at day  <dig> and day  <dig> post-atg therapy. again, we found that at day  <dig> post-atg therapy, both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells were drastically reduced in peripheral blood . in contrast, the reduction of both t cell populations in spleen at day  <dig> post-atg therapy was significantly less than in peripheral blood . we did not find significant differences between atg and isotype igg treated animals in terms of the spleen size and the total cell numbers in spleen at day  <dig> post-atg therapy . therefore, the percentage change would reflect the absolute number change in splenic t cells. again, by day  <dig> post-treatment, the percentage of cd4+ t cells did not show significant differences between the atg group and isotype igg group, in both blood and spleen . however, cd8+ t cells were significantly lower in the atg group than in control animals, in both blood and spleen . these results indicate that t cell depletion predominantly takes place in peripheral blood and that cd4+ t cells recover faster than cd8+ t cells.

atg therapy differentially depletes naive and memory t cells from the peripheral blood and spleen
it is still a matter of debate whether atg therapy preferentially depletes certain subsets of t cells  <cit> . in these experiments, we investigated changes of naive and memory t cells using cd62l and cd <dig> markers , respectively, in peripheral blood and spleen, at day  <dig> and day  <dig> post-atg treatment. we discovered that cd62l+cd4+  and cd62l+cd8+ naive t cells  were significantly reduced at day  <dig> post-atg therapy, in contrast to the isotype igg group, in both peripheral blood and spleen. of interest, the percentage of cd62l-cd44+ cd4+ t cells  and cd62l-cd44+cd8+ t cells  in total cd4+ and cd8+ t cells, respectively, were significantly increased in the atg group compared to the control group. these results suggest that atg therapy may preferentially deplete naive t cells. however, by day  <dig> post-treatment, there were no differences between two groups in the frequency of naive and memory cd4+ t cells . we did not find any differences between isotype igg treated and non-treated nod mice .

atg therapy does not affect the response of the remaining non-depleted t cells to tcr stimulation, but induces decreased levels of th <dig> and enhanced levels of il-10-producing t cells
to determine whether the immune response of t cells that are not depleted by atg therapy alters, at day  <dig> post-treatment, we prepared spleen cells from atg or isotype igg treated nod mice and stimulated them with anti-cd <dig> antibodies. t cell proliferation was measured by 3h-thymidine incorporation assay. we found that the proliferation of t cells from spleen cells of atg-treated animals was significantly lower than those obtained from isotype igg treated animals . the reduced t cell proliferation was likely attributable to the lower frequency of t cells in spleen cells from atg-treated mice. to address whether atg treatment directly modulates t cells and alters their response to tcr activation, we purified cd4+ t cells  and stimulated them with cd <dig> and cd <dig> antibody coated dynabeads. then, t cell proliferation was examined by 3h-thymidine incorporation assay. we did not observe significant differences in terms of t cell proliferation between the two groups . characterization of cytokine-producing profiles of cd4+ t cells demonstrated that cd4+ t cells from atg-treated mice produced significantly higher levels of il- <dig> with reduced levels of ifn-γ, in contrast to those from isotype igg treated mice . these data indicate that atg therapy skew t cell responses to il-10-producing t cells including th <dig> and tr <dig> 

cd4+foxp3+ tregs are less sensitive to atg depletion and remain at an increased frequency post cd4+ t cell recovery
to determine whether tregs undergo depletion post-atg therapy, nod mice at  <dig> weeks of age were treated with atg or isotype igg as described earlier. we then sacrificed one-half of the mice  from each group at day  <dig>  and the rest  at day  <dig> post-treatment, respectively, and examined the proportion of foxp3+ cd4+ t cells of total cd4+ t cells as well as their absolute numbers. as shown in figure 4a and b, compared to the isotype igg group, the atg group demonstrated a significantly increased percentage of cd25+foxp3+ cd4+ t cells in total cd4+ t cells at day  <dig> post-therapy and comparable levels of absolute numbers of these cells, suggesting that foxp3+ tregs were resistant to atg mediated depletion. moreover, at day  <dig>  when cd4+ t cells were recovered, tregs remained at higher levels in the atg treated group than in the isotype igg group . of interest, the proportionate increase of the tregs out of total cd4+ t cells in lymph nodes was even more dramatic in the atg compared to the isotype igg group at day  <dig> post-treatment . the same trend was also observed for treg’s absolute numbers .

atg therapy drives more cd62l- memory type tregs
we demonstrated  that atg preferentially depletes cd62l+ naïve t cells. it was then of interest to learn whether atg therapy depleted naïve and memory tregs differently. in these experiments, we examined splenic tregs at day  <dig> post-atg or isotype igg treatment using flow cytometry. we gated cd4+cd25+ t cells and then analyzed for the expression of foxp <dig> and cd62l. surprisingly, we noted that atg therapy significantly reduced cd62l+ naïve tregs compared to isotype igg treated animals . this finding suggests that the preservation of cd62l- memory tregs may play an important role for atg to modulate antigen-specific immune responses.

atg therapy fails to eliminate antigen primed t cell, but skews antigen-specific immune responses to th <dig> and/or tr <dig> cells
as noted earlier, atg has been used for a variety of immune-mediated conditions such as allogeneic transplantation and autoimmune diseases. one hope for atg therapy would be its ability to eliminate most antigen-specific t cells so that immune responses against allograft or self-tissues could be avoided. for example, in settings of autoimmune diabetes, a majority of β cell antigen-specific t cells are presumably primed and become β antigen-specific effector or memory t cells. in allogeneic transplantation, alloantigen-specific t cells are activated to become effector or memory t cells unless there is immune intervention. to address how atg therapy affects antigen-stimulated t cells, we designed and performed a series of experiments whereby nod mice were treated with atg or isotype igg, along with simultaneous immunization by klh protein in adjuvant alum. all mice were sacrificed at day  <dig> post-treatment, with spleen cells prepared and incubated with klh, bsa  and medium alone. we found that klh strongly stimulated spleen cells from both the atg and isotype igg treated mice to comparable levels . spleen cells from either group responded poorly to bsa stimulation . these findings suggest that atg therapy is unable to eliminate antigen-primed t cells. we also found that spleen cells from both groups responded to anti-cd <dig> antibody stimulation similarly . however, we also observed that spleen cells from the atg treated animals produced significantly increased levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and il- <dig> alongside of markedly reduced levels of ifn-γ in response to stimulation of klh , in comparison to isotype igg treated animals. these findings suggest that despite the failure to eliminate antigen-specific t cells, atg therapy induces antigen-specific t cell responses skewed to th <dig> and tr <dig>  and largely limits the inflammatory th <dig> response.

atg therapy fails to eliminate autoantigen-stimulated t cells
from the results above, it appeared that atg therapy is unable to eliminate exogenous foreign antigen stimulated t cells . it is of interest to know how atg therapy affects self antigen-stimulated t cells. to address this issue, we stimulated β cell antigen-specific t cells in nod mice at  <dig> weeks of age with an intraperitoneal injection of nit <dig>  lysates along with atg or isotype igg treatment, as described previously. in these experiments, we did not wait until  <dig> days post treatment to assess t cell responses because of the concern that the exposure of endogenous β antigens would continuously prime t cells. thus, at day  <dig> post-treatment, we sacrificed the mice, with the spleen cells prepared and stimulated with nit <dig> lysates or unrelated antigen klh. as expected, because of the transient significant depletion of t cells by atg therapy, in response to stimulation of the nit <dig> cell lysates, the proliferation of whole spleen cells from atg-treated animals was significantly lower when compared to isotype igg treated animals . however, compared to the unrelated antigen klh, nit <dig> lysates still significantly stimulated spleen cells from the atg treated animals . to determine to what degree the atg therapy depletes β antigen-specific t cells, we prepared spleen cells from the aforementioned mice and then performed an adoptive transfer of cfse-labeled spleen cells to recipient nod mice at  <dig> weeks of age. four days later, cd4+ t cell proliferation of cfse-labeled cells in inguinal and pancreatic lymph nodes was examined by flow cytometry. as shown in figure 7c, in inguinal lymph nodes, the proliferation of cd4+ t cells of injected cfse-spleen cells from atg treated animals is slightly higher than that of cd4+ t cells from control group, which may reflect the higher t cell homeostatic proliferation potential post-atg therapy  <cit> . more importantly, we found the proliferation of cfse-labeled cd4+ t cells was much higher in pancreatic than in inguinal lymph nodes for both groups, which reflects β cell-antigen specific t cell response. however, unexpectedly, in response to endogenous β cell antigens, the proliferation of those injected cd4+ t cells from atg treated animals in pancreatic lymph node was significantly higher than that of cd4+ t cells from isotype igg treated animals. these results further confirm that atg therapy fails to eliminate antigen-primed t cells. to confirm this, we demonstrated that purified cd4+ t cells from the spleen cells of both groups had comparable levels of proliferation in response to stimulation of syngenic splenic dc plus nit- <dig> lysates . nevertheless, consistent with the results shown in figure 6c, the cytokine assay for the cultures shown in figure 7b demonstrated that atg therapy suppressed β-cell antigen-specific ifn-γ production but enhanced il- <dig> production by the cd4+ t cells .

discussion
in this study, we questioned how atg therapy affected naïve and memory t cells including tregs with naïve or memory phenotypes. until now, it was unclear to what extent atg treatment affected naive and memory t cells pools. resolving this issue is of great significance in managing atg therapy in autoimmune diseases as well as in allogeneic transplantation. in line with the previous reports  <cit> , we found that atg therapy markedly depleted cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from the peripheral blood, and largely spared b cells and granulocytes. by day  <dig> post-treatment, t cell numbers reached their nadir. by day  <dig>  cd4+ t cells recovered to within normal ranges, but cd8+ t cells remained lower than baseline. it has been suggested that atg therapy may have differential effects in depleting t cells in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs dependent on dosing  <cit> . in this study, we tested our treatment protocol with optimal efficacy in preventing or reversing type  <dig> diabetes  as described in our other reports  <cit> . to determine the efficiency of our atg treatment protocol in depleting t cells from the lymphoid organs, we examined splenic cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in both groups  at day  <dig> post-atg therapy. we found that the depletion of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells was less efficient in spleen than from peripheral blood. the similar results were obtained in lymph nodes such as inguinal or pancreatic lymph nodes . of interest, it appears that atg therapy preferentially depletes cd62l+ naive t cells from the blood because the proportion of cd62l+cd4+ naive t cells was markedly reduced while cd44+cd62l- cd4+ memory t cells as a fraction of total cd4+ t cells were increased. we observed a similar significant trend in the change of naive and memory t cells in spleen as well. whether this differential depleting effect of atg exhibits in local lymph nodes, especially in pancreatic lymph nodes is of interest to be further addressed. it is unlikely that the increase of memory t cells at day  <dig> post-atg therapy is due to the conversion from naïve t cells  <cit>  because atg is still depleting t cells during this short period of time post-atg therapy, and homeostatic proliferation unlikely leads to much in the way of t cell conversion.

the relative resistance of memory t cells to atg-induced t cell depletion would allow for survival of memory t cells which potentially could lead to the recurrence of allograft rejection or autoimmunity after reconstitution of immune system post-atg therapy. consistent with this, we demonstrated that the proliferation of spleen cells from mice receiving atg and de novo klh immunization was as high as that of spleen cells from isotype igg treated animals in klh recall responses in vitro. we also found that β cell antigen-primed t cells during atg therapy could survive atg depletion as well. however, despite unaffected t cell proliferation in response to antigen stimulation post-atg therapy, the t cell cytokine-producing profile in atg treated animals indicated that atg therapy skewed th <dig> and possibly il-10-producing tr <dig>  and reduced ifn-γ-producing th <dig> responses. we had previously shown long-term reversal of diabetes in nod mice using atg or atg in combination with g-csf  <cit>  and our current findings in this report provide a mechanistic basis for this in the skewing toward th <dig> and/or il-10-producing tr <dig> responses under the regimen of atg. in this study, although we focused our studies on cd4+ t cells, it is also important to study phenotypic and functional alterations of cd8+ t cells by the atg therapy, given the pathogenic role of cd8+ t cells in type  <dig> diabetes, which will be addressed in the following future studies. the memory t cell phenotypic characteristics, as well as the functional alterations post-atg therapy, may allow the modulated antigen-primed t cells to efficiently exert their regulatory functions in the periphery through affecting their migrating and homing capabilities, thereby preventing the recurrence of autoimmunity in autoimmune diseases and allogeneic rejection in allogeneic transplantation. these findings also implicate that atg therapy plus antigen vaccination could lead to synergistic effect on induction of antigen-specific immune tolerance. such information would be of great significance for developing antigen-based immunotherapeutic strategy for autoimmune diseases such as type  <dig> diabetes.

prior to this effort, several mechanisms underlying atg immune modulation have been proposed. a common belief is that atg therapy works by t cell depletion through complement-mediated cell lysis and activation-induced cell death. however, another view regarding atg therapy is that this agent exerts immunosuppressive function beyond that of simple t cell depletion  <cit> . atg therapy may modulate immune response in vivo through inhibiting chemokine-driven t cell chemotaxis  <cit> . it may also influence the interaction between t cells and endothelial cells through modulating expression of adhesion molecules  <cit> . our recent study showed that atg therapy eliminated certain subset of dendritric cells and induced tolerogenic dendritic cells  <cit> . in addition, atg therapy may facilitate tolerance induction through atg-mediated apoptosis of t cells; because t cell apoptosis induced by anti-cd <dig> therapy was recently demonstrated to be associated with cd <dig> antibody therapy-induced immune tolerance  <cit> . the skewing of antigen-specific th <dig> and il-10-producing regulatory t cells  by atg therapy demonstrated in the current study suggests that the non-depleted antigen-responding t cells, instead of causing immune attack, may lead to antigen-specific restoration of immune tolerance, which implies that atg works as immune modulator rather than immune suppressant.

as suggested previously, foxp3+ tregs may play a major role in preventing autoimmune diabetes during atg therapy  <cit> . however, it is incompletely understood whether atg therapy depletes tregs differently than conventional t cells and how atg affects the distribution of tregs in different lymphoid tissues. it is also unclear whether atg therapy affects naïve and memory tregs differently. in the present study, we demonstrated that atg therapy was less efficient in depleting cd4+foxp3+tregs and as a result, the proportion of cd4+foxp3+ tregs in cd4+ t cells was significantly increased in atg treated animals compared to controls. this increase is even more dramatic in lymph nodes with greater than a doubling in the frequency of tregs within total cd4+ t cells in atg treated as compared to isotype igg treated animals. in some animals, the percentage of foxp3+ tregs reaches 30% of total lymph node cd4+ t cells. unlike equivalent absolute numbers of splenic tregs in both groups, the absolute number of tregs in lymph nodes was significantly higher in atg than in isotype igg treated group at  <dig> days post treatment, suggesting that more tregs were recruiting to the lymph nodes besides resistance to atg depletion. the increase of tregs in lymph nodes may be of great immunological significance for atg to control local antigen-specific immune responses in the settings of autoimmunity such as type  <dig> diabetes, as well as in allogeneic transplantation. this increase of tregs  <dig> days post-atg therapy is unlikely due to the preferential proliferation of tregs in the atg-therapy induced lymphopenic animals  <cit>  because the proliferation is limited in this short period of time especially still under active t cell depletion. of interest, by day  <dig> post-atg treatment when cd4+ t cells return to the normal levels, tregs remained proportionately higher in the atg group than in control group, which may be attributable to a faster proliferation of tregs than conventional t cells  <cit>  because tregs possess superior capability to utilize il- <dig> to conventional t cells  <cit> . this may also explain why a short-term atg therapy offers a long-term protection in type  <dig> diabetes  <cit>  and in allogeneic transplantation  <cit> . intriguingly, tregs with memory t cell phenotype were preferentially preserved in atg therapy, which suggests that the preserved memory tregs specific to certain antigens would be more potent in suppressing effector t cells reactive to the same antigens. as suggested recently  <cit> , the memory tregs may home to areas with active immunological reaction to quickly exert their regulatory function preferentially to naïve tregs. this also explains the findings in our recent report that the post-therapy tregs gain heightened immunosuppressive capacity  <cit> . there is evidence that the progression of autoimmunity in nod mice leads to memory-like cd8+ tregs which can be expanded in vivo by stimulation of nanoparticles coated with mhc-carried autoantigenic peptides. of note, injection of these nanoparticles not only prevented t1d but also reversed overt diabetes in nod mice  <cit> . thus, the quantitative and qualitative changes of tregs post atg therapy may play an important role in suppressing antigen-specific effector t cells. although tregs are generally thought to suppress t cell responses in an antigen non-specific manner, emerging evidence shows that antigen-specific tregs are more potent in suppressing antigen-specific t cell responses  <cit> . lu, et al. reported recently that atg therapy indeed induced self-antigen-specific tregs in vivo that could provide long-term t1d protection in nod mice  <cit> . whether the increased memory tregs post atg therapy plus antigen challenge in our experimental settings contain more antigen-specific tregs needs to be further explored.

CONCLUSIONS
atg therapy preferentially depletes naive t cells, largely spares tregs and alters t cell cytokine-producing profiles. thus, atg therapy may modulate antigen-specific immune responses through inducing memory-like regulatory t cells as well as other protective t cells such as th <dig> and il-10-producing tr <dig> cells.
