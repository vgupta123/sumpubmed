BACKGROUND
since its first isolation from mice in  <dig>  efforts have been devoted to the studies of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae . e. rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive bacterium that has diverse cell morphology, remarkable chemical tolerance and poorly understood cellular structure and molecular mechanisms, especially those related to its virulence in a wide range of hosts, ranging from mammals and birds to reptiles and fish. best known as the etiological agent of swine erysipelas– a disease that can cause acute symptoms such as septicaemia or lead to chronic syndromes like arthritis and endocarditis in pigs  <cit> , e. rhusiopathiae is generally believed to be transmitted via the gastrointestinal  tract by intake of contaminated water or food and causes great economical loss in husbandry worldwide. given its ubiquitous nature in the environment and reservoir of asymptomatic carriers amongst both domestic and wild animals, the prevention and control of swine erysipelas is often challenging. more than  <dig> serovars have so far been described  <cit> . however, due to the considerable variance in their morphology, host specificity and/or pathogenicity, the practicality of serotyping remains debatable. the heat labile capsule of e. rhusiopathiae has been associated with its resistance to phagocytosis and virulence by transposon mutagenesis study  <cit> . surface proteins such as neuraminidase, spaa antigen, two adhesive surface proteins containing the c-terminal anchoring lpxtg motif  have shown positive correlation to virulence of the bacteria  <cit> – <cit> , however, little is known about the mechanisms of its pathogenicity.

in china, outbreaks of swine erysipelas have surfaced in recent years despite its relative tranquility in the past  <dig> decades, with an alarming trend of developing from scattered, domestic occurrences in a few farms to systemic outbursts in provincial scale. three representative local reports, which are only available in chinese, are included in additional file  <dig>  in present study, we isolated an outbreak field strain sy <dig> from siyang, jiangsu and completed its bacterial genome sequencing and assembly. the complete genome of e. rhusiopathiae strain fujisawa has just recently been published  <cit> . together with the draft genome of strain atcc <dig>  data-mining of potential virulence factors, especially those related to capsular protein biosynthesis, would offer us a more reliable comparative genomic analysis and a better understanding of the common genomic structure and a more precise prediction of potential virulence factors for improvement of vaccine targets or strategy of disease control.

methods
isolation and total dna extraction of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> was collected from a pig farm in siyang, jiangsu. anticoagulant-treated blood was collected from diseased pigs by in-house veterinarians from pig farms following the nanjing agricultural university animal ethics committee guidelines  and sent to our laboratory. the sample was inoculated in martin’s broth supplemented with 400 μg/ml neomycin and 70 μg/ml vancomycin. a single colony was isolated by inoculation of the culture on streaked agar plate supplemented with horse serum.

the single colony of the bacterium was inoculated in modified feist broth , 5 g yeast extract,  <dig>  g l-arginine,  <dig>  ml tween  <dig>  in 1 l of  <dig>  m sodium phosphate buffer   <cit>  supplemented with 5%  fetal bovine serum  and 50 μg/ml kanamycin and grown to its exponential growth phase. bacteria were harvested by centrifuge and its genomic dna was extracted according to the jgi bacterial dna isolation ctab protocol .

pyrosequencing and complete genome assembly of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
to confirm the purity of the genomic dna of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig>  16s rdna-specific region was amplified and  <dig> individual positive clones were sequenced by genetic analyzer  <dig> . blastn analysis  <cit>  revealed that e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> gdna sequences have high similarity to those from the other  <dig> strains of e. rhusiopathiae publicly accessible. the quality and quantity of genomic dna were evaluated by  <dig> % agarose gel electrophoresis and nanodrop <dig> , and using the quant-it picogreen dsdna kit , respectively.

a whole genome shotgun library was generated with 500 ng of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027genomic dna. the shotgun sequencing procedure was performed using  <dig> gs junior general library preparation kit, following the manufacturer’s instruction . in addition, an 8 kb span paired end library was generated with 15 μg of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> genomic dna. the paired end sequencing procedure was performed using  <dig> gs junior paired end library preparation kit, following the manufacturer’s instruction . paired end reads were used as orientation guide for assembling the contigs into scaffolds. the dna libraries were amplified by empcr and sequenced by flx titanium sequencing chemistry . one shotgun run and one paired end run were performed on individual libraries prepared with same genomic dna sample. after sequencing, the raw data were assembled by newbler  <dig>   with default parameters. primer pairs were designed along the sequences flanking the gap regions for pcr gap filling. the complete genome of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> was submitted to ncbi genbank and is publicly accessible .

genome annotation of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
glimmer  <dig>   <cit>  was used for gene prediction in e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> complete genome. all predicted orf sequences were translated into amino acid sequences by in-house perl scripts. blastp  <cit>  was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the ncbi non-redundant  database . amino acid sequences with alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 40% match identity were chosen and the description of the best hit  was assigned as the annotation of predicted gene. intergenic regions were annotated by repeatmasker  with default parameters. for fair comparison, genome annotation was simultaneously conducted using pgaap .

functional gene analysis
blastp  <cit>  was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the cog database  <cit> . amino acid sequences with alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 20% match identity were chosen and the description of the best hit  was assigned as the annotation of predicted gene. all annotated genes were then classified based on their cog classes and compared to that of e. rhusiopathiae strain fujisawa.

pathway analysis
glimmer-predicted orf sequences of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027were translated into amino acid sequences by in-house perl scripts. all sequences were submitted to kegg database  <cit>  for automatic pathway annotation  and then manually downloaded and curated by in-house perl scripts.

virulence gene analysis
blastp  <cit>  was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the vfdb database  <cit> . amino acid sequences with alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 20% match identity were chosen and the description of the best hit  was assigned as the annotation of predicted gene.

genomic island  and pathogenicity island  analyses
genomic islands and pathogenicity islands were annotated using islandviewer   <cit>  and pai finder  on paidb  <cit>  respectively.

drug resistant gene analysis
blastp  <cit>  was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the ardb database  <cit> . amino acid sequences with alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 40% match identity were chosen and the description of the best hit  was assigned as the annotation of predicted gene. all annotated genes were designated by the antibiotics to which they render the bacteria resistant and compared to that of e. rhusiopathiae strains sy <dig> 

annotation of plasmid/phage/prophage-derived genes using aclame database
blastp  <cit>  was applied to align the amino acid sequences against the aclame database  <cit> . amino acid sequences with alignment length over 90% of its own length and over 40% match identity were chosen and the description of the best hit  was assigned as the annotation of predicted gene. all annotated genes were classified according to their corresponding potential horizontal transferring vectors  and then compared to that identified in strain fujisawa.

comparative genomic analysis of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> and strain fujisawa
complete genomes of e. rhusiopathiae strain fujisawa  was downloaded from ncbi genbank. orthologous genes were identified by reciprocal blat  <cit>  using glimmer-predicted e. rhusiopathiae strains sy <dig> and fujisawa genes. predicted genes of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> which are found as single copies and with 90% minimum alignment length in strain fujisawa were designated as the core genes.

RESULTS
sequencing and assembly of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> complete genome
erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> genome was sequenced and its complete de novo assembly was achieved by one shotgun run and one 8 kb-span paired end run followed by pcr gap filling. a total of  <dig>  raw shotgun reads  and  <dig>  raw paired end reads  were generated, ~ <dig> % and ~ <dig> % of them, respectively, were aligned into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> scaffolds, yielding an average sequencing depth of ~23-fold. average read lengths for the shotgun run and the paired end run are ~400 bp and ~300 bp, respectively. the largest scaffold is  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  in size and contains  <dig> large contigs, while that of the n <dig> contig is  <dig>  bp, indicating that the raw assembly is highly continuous. after pcr gap filling by sanger sequencing, the complete circular genome of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> is  <dig>  mb  with  <dig> % gc content, which is just ~30 kb smaller than and share the same gc content to that in strain fujisawa .

genome annotation of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
 <dig>  open reading frames  were predicted by glimmer version  <dig> , and  <dig>  of them  were annotated by blastp search against the ncbi non-redundant  database . the full annotation result was attached as additional file  <dig>  simultaneous annotation using pgaap yielded  <dig>  cds .both numbers of annotated cds were similar to that in strain fujisawa .  <dig> rrna and  <dig> trna were identified via pgaap. majority of them were arranged as large rna islands–  <dig> ribosomal rna  operons  and  <dig> trna islands . the rrn operons are arranged in the typical order of 16s, 23s and 5s rrna genes, with the exception of rrn operon  <dig> which is composed of an additional copy of 5s rrna gene . in comparison to strain fujisawa , a considerably fewer number of  <dig> rrn operons are present in strain sy <dig> genome . the loci of pgaap-annotated cds, ncbi nr annotated cds and various rna islands were labeled in the circular representation of the sy <dig> genome .

comparative genomic analysis of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
 <dig>  core genes  were identified in the pan-genome  of the three e. rhusiopathiae strains .  <dig> genes are shared only between strains sy <dig> and fujisawa but not atcc <dig>  and only  <dig> between strains sy <dig> and atcc <dig>  whilst a far greater number of  <dig> genes are shared between strains fujisawa and atcc <dig>  similarly, a greater number of  <dig> strain-specific genes were identified in strain sy <dig>  in comparison to  <dig> in strain fujisawa and  <dig> in strain atcc <dig>  these figures imply that the strains fujisawa and atcc <dig> may be more similar to each other than to our strain sy <dig>  despite preliminary serotyping results that strain sy <dig> is of serotype 1a, same with the other two strains .synteny between the two complete genomes of strains sy <dig> and fujisawa is generally conserved, apart from a rearrangement observed at the ~850-875 kb region on strain sy <dig>  and an unmatched stretch between the two strains which is marked by a red box in figure  <dig> 

as suggested by a previous phylogenetic analysis after completion of strain fujisawa genome sequencing  <cit> , erysipelothrix spp. form a distinct secluded group sandwiched between the firmicutes and mollicutes. since neither draft nor complete genomes of closely related species e.g. e. tonsillarum and e. inopinata were available on genbank, while those less closely related ones have already been explored in the previous article, hence phylogenetic tree was not constructed in our present study.

cog annotation and comparative analysis of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> with strains fujisawa and atcc19414
 <dig>   of all  <dig>  predicted orf were annotated by blastp search against ncbi cog database. the top ten cog classes they were annotated in were  general function prediction only ,  translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis ,  carbohydrate transport and metabolism ,  replication, recombination and repair ,  function unknown ,  transcription ,  inorganic ion transport and metabolism ,  amino acid transport and metabolism ,  defense mechanisms , and  cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis . as expected, majority of the genes were involved in basic cellular functions, such as replication, transcription, translation and metabolism, however, up to ~ <dig> % of them only have predicted or unknown functions on cog database. cog class distribution of strain sy <dig> was illustrated . numbers and percentage of each cog class were tabulated as additional file  <dig> and their detailed annotations attached as additional file  <dig> 

similar numbers of cog-annotated genes were found in strains fujisawa  and atcc  <dig>  . percentage of gene annotation in atcc  <dig> is possibly higher due to incomplete sequencing coverage and assembly. cog class distributions are highly similar between strains sy <dig> and fujisawa .

virulence gene/pathogenicity island-like gene annotation and comparative analysis of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> and with strains fujisawa and atcc19414
 <dig> potential virulence genes  were identified by blastp search against vfdb. categorized by their respective cog classes, their accession numbers and descriptions are listed in additional file  <dig>  many of these potential virulence genes are grouped under or partially involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis  or inorganic ion transport and metabolism . the former mainly includes enzymes or proteins involved in capsular polysaccharide and glycoprotein biosynthesis, and the latter include transporters for iron and magnesium uptake and manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase. metal ions are scarce and limited in biological systems and their uptake by bacteria upon invasion of various host cells have shown positive correlation to bacterial virulence  <cit> – <cit> . however, their functions and possible relevance to pathogenicity in e. rhusiopathiae remain unresolved. a modestly higher number of virulence genes were identified in strain sy <dig> than in strain fujisawa in vfdb, while the number in strain atcc <dig> might be overestimated due to its draft genome nature .

 <dig> genomic island-like regions were annotated via island viewer, while  <dig> pathogenicity island -like islands were identified in strain sy <dig> via pai finder in paidb . in comparison to the search result in vfdb, only one pai-virulence gene  was annotated in pai-l <dig>  it may suggest strain sy <dig> genome has pai-like islands atypical of that found in strain fujisawa and the present entries in the paidb. though groel is a chaperonin widely conserved in bacteria, its association to cell adherence and virulence has been described in clostridium spp. and other bacteria  <cit> . suggestion of a pai-island with groel in our strain may warrant further studies in elucidating its contribution to pathogenicity, as it may offer interesting insights into potential antigenic targets for vaccine development in e. rhusiopathiae. in addition to the difference in gc content to the rest of the genome, trna were found to flank gi- <dig>  pai-l <dig> and pai-l <dig>  providing further support to these putative genomic islands . nevertheless, the virulence of these putative regions in e. rhusiopathiae needs further elucidation, preferably by gene-knockout experiments. since atcc <dig> genome was only completed to the level of scaffolds, search for gi/pai-like islands was unfeasible.

apart from the public databases, a list of potential virulence factors previously suggested in e. rhusiopathiae were identified in the strain sy <dig> genome, and they span across various categories, including surface proteins, antioxidant proteins, phospholipases, hemolysins, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis and extracellular proteins/enzymes .

surface proteins were annotated based on their lpxtg motifs, which act as sortase recognition sequence for the covalent binding of their carboxyl termini by sortases in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> , or gw  repeats for non-covalent interactions as observed in e. rhusiopathiae <cit> . these include spaa antigen which is commonly used as vaccine target  <cit> , hyaluronidases and neuraminidases which may promote bacterial-host cell surface association  <cit> , rspa and rspb proteins which bind fibronectin and collagen i and ii and may participate in biofilm formation  <cit> . interestingly, a premature stop codon  was found near the middle of putative rspa gene , leading to the annotation of  <dig> rspa-like proteins, each representing the n-terminally and c-terminally truncated proteins in strain sy <dig> genome , instead of  <dig> in strain fujisawa. though our preliminary results suggest that these truncated proteins do not influence the serotyping of strain sy <dig> , their conformation, collagen binding capability and influence on host-bacterial interaction may need further elucidation.

e. rhusiopathiae was hypothesized to have an atypical capsule that renders it escape from phagocytosis and antioxidant proteins that facilitates its survival inside polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages  <cit> . transposon mutagenesis study showed that the loss of a cluster of genes, putatively a polycistronic mrna-coding operon, in strain fujisawa created a mutant deprived of capsule and pathogenicity  <cit> . the operon was identified, including all  <dig> proteins potentially involved in capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, in strain sy <dig>  similarly, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxins, thiol peroxidase, alkyl-hydroperoxide reductases and other proteins which confer resistance to oxidative stress, were also found in strain sy <dig> 

phospholipases are often considered as potential virulence factors for intracellular pathogens, hypothesized via acquisition of host membrane lipids and disruption of phagosomal membrane. in strain sy <dig> genome,  <dig> phospholipases were identified, same as in strain fujisawa .

as e. rhusiopathiae is highly tolerant and almost ubiquitous in nature, two-component regulatory systems which often regulate responses to changes in the environment were also searched for in strain sy <dig> genome.  <dig> pairs of histidine kinase-response regulator were identified–  <dig> shown similarity to phor-phob two-component regulatory system and the remaining one to agrc-agra two-component regulatory system .

the highly potential virulence factors annotated both via vfdb and literature search - hlyb, cap5e, cap5f, cap5g, prra, soda and virr  – may require further elucidation on their correlation to pathogenicity, especially in intracellular survival of e. rhusiopathiae.

potential drug resistance gene in e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
 <dig> potential drug resistance genes were annotated in e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig>  suggesting it may be resistant to macrolides, vancomycin and teicoplanin . their orthologs were also found in strain fujisawa, sharing ~98-100% match id . interestingly, a richer reservoir of potential drug resistance genes, both in number and variety, was annotated in strain atcc <dig> . our preliminary antimicrobial results suggested that despite the presence of potential macrolide-resistant genes , the antimicrobial susceptibilities to different macrolide-class drugs  vary from moderate to minimal levels , hinting that further functional elucidation, preferably gene-knockout experiments, of the potential drug resistance genes are required to substantiate the in silico deduction. in addition, a previous investigation on antimicrobial susceptibilities of e. rhusiopathiae suggested that it has partial or complete resistance to other classes of antibiotics  <cit>  which were not identified in our present search, hinting the presence of other potential drug resistance genes, either novel or unlisted in the ardb, in the bacteria.

potential horizontal transferring elements in e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
horizontal transferring elements are common in bacteria and generally believed to be a significant driving force in prokaryotic evolution  <cit> . they are mainly divided into three types based on their respective vectors – plasmids, phages  and prophages  <cit> . in strain sy <dig> genome,  <dig> potential horizontal transferring elements  were annotated via blastp against the aclame database . amongst them, the majority  were putatively derived from plasmids, while the rest were from phages  and from prophages . similar figures were observed in strain fujisawa genome, with a slightly fewer number of putative plasmid-derived genes and doubled number of putative phage-derived genes.  <dig> potential horizontal transferring elements were found in the draft genome of strain atcc <dig>  yet it might be an over-estimated figure due to incomplete or possible mis-assembly.

as observed in figure  <dig>  some of the potential virulence factors identified might have originated from horizontal gene transfer. two of them –prra and soda–have high virulence potential owing to their identification via both vfdb and literature search. the former is the transcriptional regulator in a prra-prrb two-component regulatory system related to oxygen control and intracellular replication in mycobacterium <cit> , while the latter encodes a superoxide dismutase which may offer a mean of antioxidant defense which is critical for intracellular survival and growth in e. rhusiopathiae <cit> .

kegg pathway analysis of e. rhusiopathiae strain sy1027
kegg pathway analysis was performed for e. rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig>  and the full list of kegg pathway annotation was listed in additional file  <dig>  strain sy <dig> genome contains glucose-specific iia component in phosphotransferase system , endoglucanase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, which suggest that the bacteria is capable in breaking down maltose and trehalose, cellulose and fructose, respectively. the potential of utilizing other sugars besides glucose may partly explain the ubiquitous nature of e. rhusiopathiae in the environment. similar to strain fujisawa, many critical genes in the tricarboxylic acid  cycle were found missing in strain sy <dig>  with the exception of fumarate hydratase, citrate coa-transferase, dihydrolipoamidesuccinyltransferase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. genome reduction was previously hypothesized in e. rhusiopathiae strain fujisawa, given the partial loss of fatty acid biosynthesis and dna repair system similar in the mollicutes  <cit> . likewise, strain sy <dig> seems to display these characteristics. apart from the partial loss of tca cycle genes, only  <dig> genes related to dna repair were identified.

CONCLUSIONS
the complete genome of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae strain sy <dig> was sequenced and assembled. it is  <dig> , <dig> base pairs long, just  <dig> kilobases smaller than strain fujisawa, with the same gc level of  <dig> %. it contains  <dig> open reading frames  predicted by glimmer  <dig> , of which  <dig>  are annotated by ncbi nr blast,  <dig> by cog database and  <dig> by kegg database.  <dig> potential virulence factors are annotated in strain sy <dig> by vfdb, while  <dig>  of them are common in the  <dig> strains,  <dig> of which are potentially related to antibiotic resistance and highly conserved  amongst the three strains of e. rhusiopathiae and only modestly homologous to other gastrointestinal tract-inhabiting firmicutes , e.g. clostridium spp., enterococcus spp. molecular identification of these genomic elements and potential virulence factors offer insights into testing prospective vaccine targets besides the widely used spaa antigens in swine erysipelas and development of more effective treatment or prevention in control of the disease.
