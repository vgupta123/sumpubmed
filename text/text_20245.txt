BACKGROUND
mtm  family factors are members of the growing class of dual-specificity phosphatases  including pten, which can dephosphorylate the products of phosphoinositide 3-kinases , and are negative regulators of the pi3k/akt signaling pathways <cit> . a potential function for pi3k and pten has been suggested in both angiogenic signaling <cit>  and various models of muscle defects <cit> . and, dual-specific phosphatase- <dig>  has been identified to play a functional role in vascular development through counteracting the function of snrk- <dig>  a serine threonine kinase in angioblast development <cit> . however, functions of mtm family members in these processes are not clear.

in vertebrates, vascular and muscular systems are tightly connected. and, the cells in dorsal aorta and myotomal muscle are both derived from mesoderm. endothelial cells  forming intersegmental vessel  migrate following a path initially along the somite boundary and later between notochord and somitic tissue <cit> . these data suggested that a dynamic connection between somitogenesis and vasculature development might exist, and the connection might be influenced by some signaling molecules. for example, semaphorin-plexin-signaling was proved to play significant roles in both somitogenesis and vasculature formation in zebrafish <cit> . furthermore, zebrafish perlecan was demonstrated to play a central function in skeletal muscle and cardiovascular development <cit> .

several signaling pathways, such as vascular endothelial growth factor  signaling, and pi3k/akt and hedgehog  signaling which genetically interacts with each other <cit> , had been shown to be involved in vascular formation. in vitro studies suggested a role for akt/pkb as a downstream effector of vegf signaling <cit> . moreover, over-expression of the downstream effector akt/pkb rescued vegf receptor blockade <cit> . in addition, activation of protein kinase a , a negative regulator of hedgehog pathway, effectively inhibited akt, which demonstrated a direct role for akt in regulating hedgehog signaling <cit> . myocardial hh activation triggered by fgf signaling, is essential for vegf expression <cit> . however, these signaling interactions form complicated network and need further explanation.

specific genes controlling artery/vein specification have been identified in different vertebrate species <cit> . in zebrafish embryo, sonic hedgehog  and vegf, expressed in the notochord and somite respectively, are required for arterial specification <cit> . conversely, activation of pi3k/akt signaling in angioblasts promotes venous specification <cit> . however, the precise mechanism of signaling interactions in vascular development remains to be elucidated. interestingly, our recent study has shown a functional cooperation of the mtm family member mtmr <dig> with pi3k in muscle development in zebrafish, and revealed a possible participation of mtmr <dig> in the hedgehog  pathway <cit> . to explore the function of mtmr <dig> in vasculature development, here, we further observed the vascular development defects of mtmr <dig> loss-of-function. subsequently, we found that the mtmr <dig>  as a negative regulator of pi3k, affected the hedgehog and vegf pathway in the blood vessel development in vivo. the data indicate that mtmr <dig> is essential for vasculature development in zebrafish.

RESULTS
developmental defects of hemato-vascular progenitors in mtmr <dig> morphants
during zebrafish somitogenesis, mtmr <dig> transcript was detected in early somitic mesoderm between 1- <dig> somites, and later in ventral mesoderm <cit> , where multipotential progenitors gives rise to at least two different tissues: the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages <cit> . in order to reveal further functions of mtmr <dig>  we analyzed the expression pattern of some known early marker genes for hemato-vascular progenitors in lateral mesoderm of mtmr <dig> morphants by in situ hybridization. as shown in figure  <dig>  the early angioblast/hematopoietic mesoderm marker genes, scl and hbae <dig>  are expressed in anterior lateral mesoderm  and/or posterior lateral mesoderm  in cont-mo injected embryos , whereas at the same embryonic stage of  <dig> somites, significant expression reduction is observed in mtmr <dig> morphants . and, mtmr <dig> knockdown simultaneously affects the formation of somitic mesoderm, because myod expression is significantly reduced in mtmr <dig> morphants in comparison to cont-mo embryos . as scl was demonstrated to be very critical for zebrafish endothelial and artery development <cit> , we further assayed expression of fli <dig>  a marker for endothelial cells and also for a subset of the hematopoietic cells in early development stage <cit> . compared to cont-mo embryos , fli <dig> is also significantly reduced in anterior lateral mesoderm  of the mtmr <dig> morphants, whereas its expression defect is mild in posterior lateral mesoderm  . moreover, the expression differences of these marker genes were confirmed by quantitative rt-pcr. as shown in figure 1i, the expression levels of scl, hbae <dig>  myod, and fli <dig> are greatly reduced to  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the control embryos. the data indicate that mtmr <dig> knockdown affects endothelial cell formation and results in developmental defects of hemato-vascular progenitors.

determination of abnormal vascular phenotypes in mtmr <dig> morphant embryos
previous study has observed that mtmr <dig> is expressed predominantly in the vasculature around and after  <dig> hpf <cit> . to determine whether mtmr <dig> is required for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, transgenic tgla <dig> <cit>  embryos were injected with morpholino against mtmr <dig> as described previously <cit> , and their vasculature development was assayed. as shown in figure  <dig>  in comparison with normal vasculature phenotypes in cont-mo embryos , the primary intersegmental vessel  <cit>  and dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel  can sprout and form, but intensive defects are observed in mtmr8-mo morphants at  <dig> hpf. the vascular plexus in tail seems to be less complex and becomes narrow. significantly, the mtmr <dig> morphants display a remarkable reduction in the size of dorsal aorta , and the da size reduction degree is correlated with severity of the impaired se . the defected embryos are divided into three kinds according to relative normal se number. the severely defected embryos with less than  <dig> normal se and mild defected embryos with more than  <dig> normal se in the trunk are  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively, whereas normal phenotype is only  <dig> % . to demonstrate the defected specificity, we co-injected  <dig> pg of zebrafish mtmr <dig> mrna with the mo, and thereby led to an increase percentage of embryos in mild  and normal  phenotypes . and, we co-injected a mis-match mtmr <dig> mrna which is unable to bind mo because of the existence of nucleotide substitutions but still encodes the same protein, with the mo, and could also rescue the morphant . previous study observed that the expression of ptc <dig>  a downstream target gene of the hedgehog signaling pathway, was reduced in mtmr <dig> morphants, which could be rescued by co-injection with dnpka mrna <cit> . and, the hedgehog signaling pathway was shown to be essential for vasculture differentiation and to induce the expression of vegf during the same process <cit> . consistently, the vascular defect of mtmr <dig> morphants could be rescued by co-injection of  <dig> pg dnpka mrna . and, scl overexpression could partially rescue the vascular defect of mtmr <dig> morphants, even though the defect reduction was very small . moreover, he stained longitudinal and transverse sections were analyzed. in comparison with that of cont-mo embryos , the da appears more narrow in the mtmr <dig> morphants . these data indicate that mtmr <dig> is essential for the integrity of muscle and vasculature development, and that hedgehog pathway mediates these biological activities.

to clarify what stage of vasculogenesis is affected, we further observed blood circulation and vascular phenotypes in early morphant embryos. the movies at same stages of  <dig> hpf  and  <dig> hpf  reveal significant difference of blood cell circulation between normal control embryos and morphant embryos. in cont-mo embryos, blood cells normally circulate in the trunk vessels, whereas almost no any blood cells flow in that of  <dig> hpf morphant embryos , and only a few of blood cells move through arteries and veins in that of  <dig> hpf morphant embryos . we also checked the cardiac system, however, no obvious cardiac defect was observed in the mtmr <dig> morphants . moreover, abnormal vasculogenesis was early observed in mtmr <dig> morphant embryos of tgla <dig> transgenic zebrafish. as shown in figure  <dig>  when se sprouts have produced at  <dig> hpf and complete vascular system has formed at  <dig> hpf in cont-mo embryos , the corresponding vascular structures are absent or abnormal at the same stages in the mtmr <dig> morphant embryos . the above data further indicate that the vascular development defect begins from the early stage, because the down-regulation of multiple vascular marker genes for vasculogenesis has been observed in the mtmr <dig> morphant embryos.

expression defects of molecular marker genes for artery/vein and vascular endothelium in mtmr <dig> morphants
to further reveal molecular expression defects, we firstly used the endothelial cell marker fli <dig> to monitor the effect of mtmr <dig> knockdown on vascular development. as shown in figure  <dig>  in cont-mo embryos, fli <dig> is abundantly expressed in axial vasculature and se sprouts from the dorsal aorta at  <dig> hpf , whereas in mtmr <dig> morphants at the same stage, little fli <dig> transcript is observed in the corresponding axial vasculature and se sprout regions . the data indicates that the endothelial-cell differentiation giving rise to the axial vasculature is defective in mtmr <dig> morphants. as the later-forming se and new vessel growth were believed to form respectively by sprouting and from preexisting vessels <cit> , we next checked the formation of primary vasculature. the expression of ephrinb2a, an artery marker, was detected in presumptive da region of cont-mo embryos . however, its expression was severely reduced in the mtmr <dig> morphants , suggesting that the artery development should be impaired. the expression of vein marker flt <dig> was observed in pcv region of cont-mo embryos , whereas the flt4-positive pcv regions were expanded, and its expression was partially reduced in the mtmr <dig> morphants . to confirm the role of mtmr <dig> in artery formation, we further examined the expression changes of two notch signaling markers notch <dig> and grl/hey <dig>  as shown in figure 4g-j, significant expression decrease of the two arterial marker genes was observed in the mtmr <dig> morphants.

moreover, the effects of mtmr <dig> knockdown on vasculogenesis were judged by endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. in cont-mo embryos , the endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity labeled the major cerebral vessels and the subintestinal vessels . however, all mtmr <dig> morphants displayed an obvious reduction in the head signal and a total absence of siv labeling . the obvious effects of mtmr <dig> knockdown on endothelial cell alkaline phosphatase activity further suggest that the vascular changes should be specific to endothelial cells, and the endothelial cell marker gene fli <dig> should be primary target for the mtmr <dig> functions.

mtmr <dig> mediates pi3k/akt signaling for artery specification
in our previous study, mtmr <dig> knockdown was revealed to activate the pi3k/akt pathway <cit> . to determine whether the cooperation of mtmr <dig> with pi3k plays a role during vasculogenesis, we firstly assayed the affect of pi3k inhibitor ly <dig> on mtmr <dig> expression in zebrafish embryos. as shown in figure  <dig>  compared with control embryos , lower concentration of ly <dig>  has no obvious effect on mtmr <dig> expression in wild-type embryos , but significant increase expression of mtmr <dig> appears in the trunk vasculature when  <dig> μm ly <dig> is used . figure 5i shows the quantitative data from q-rt-pcr.

in mtmr <dig> morphants, the expression of artery marker gene ephrinb2a was severely reduced  in the trunk region, but the reduced levels were variable, and might be classified into three kinds: normal, similar to consistent expression in wild-type , mild defect, patchy expression in some cells along the da , severe defect, almost no any ephrinb2a expression in the trunk da . in previous studies <cit> , when treated with  <dig> μm ly <dig>  about half of the mtmr <dig> morphants could be further deteriorated in muscle development, and the others were mildly or not obviously affected . however,  <dig> μm ly <dig> had no obvious effect on the muscle phenotype of the morphants. interestingly, when  <dig> μm ly <dig> was used to treat the mtmr <dig> morphants, a significantly increasing proportion of normal embryos was found in the morphants . subsequently, we checked phosphorylation status of another early arterial progenitor marker erk  <cit>  in the mtmr <dig> morphants by western blot analysis, and found that loss of mtmr <dig> function significantly reduces erk phosphorylation . the data indicate that mtmr <dig> negatively mediates pi3k/akt signaling for artery specification.

mtmr <dig> is essential for normal vasculature development through regulating hedgehog and vegf signaling pathways
hh signaling is multi-functional, and its role is temporal-spatially determined during embryogenesis <cit> . shh from the notochord promotes vegf expression by the adjacent somite, which promotes expression of the artery-specific ephrinb <dig> in the dorsal aorta <cit> . to determine the position of mtmr <dig> in this regulatory cascade, we tested its expression in embryos when these pathways were inhibited. as shown in figure 6a and 6b, in  <dig> hpf wild-type embryos, ephrinb2a is absent in the dorsal aorta when exposed to  <dig> μm cyclopamine, and vegf expression is lost within the somites but persisted within the hypochord , which means that inhibition of hedgehog signaling can partially disrupt vegf expression. then, we investigated whether cyclopamine could also inhibit the mtmr <dig> expression. as shown in figure 6c-f, mtmr <dig> shows stronger expression in the posterior cardinal vein than in the dorsal aorta of wild-type control embryos , and its expression was obviously upregulated in the cyclopamine-treated embryos . figure 6k shows the gradient up-regulation of mtmr <dig> under different doses of cyclopamine obtained from q-rt-pcr.

vascular function is tightly regulated by vegf signaling pathway <cit> . to assess whether mtmr <dig> influenced the developing vasculature through vegf pathway, we treated  <dig> hpf embryos with a vegf receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, su <dig>  in comparison with control embryos , the embryos incubated with  <dig> μm of su <dig> failed to show vascular expression of mtmr <dig> in the trunk at  <dig> hpf , and the reduced transcript levels were detected under different doses of su <dig> by q-rt-pcr , suggesting that mtmr <dig> might act downstream of vegf to determine arterial cell fate. moreover, we checked the expression of vegf <dig> in mtmr <dig> morphants and control embryos, and found a significant down-regulation of vegf <dig> expression within the somites at  <dig> hpf , and the quantitative down-regulation change was confirmed by q-rt-pcr .

in zebrafish, over-expression of either vegf <dig> or vegf <dig> could rescue arterial differentiation blocked by a deficiency of shh signaling <cit> . direct activation of pka, an inhibitor of hedgehog signaling, induces endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, and suppressing the pka activity by expression of dnpka, promotes endothelial cell survival and migration during angiogenesis <cit> . mtmr <dig> acts downstream of vegf to determine arterial cell fate, and its knockdown can impair the hedgehog signaling. on this basis, we further assessed whether exogenous vegf and hedgehog signaling were sufficient to rescue ephrinb2a expression in the absence of mtmr <dig> activity. as shown in figure 6m, when injected with  <dig> pg dnpka or vegf121+vegf  <dig> mrna, the ephrinb2a expression in mtmr <dig> morphants can be rescued as shown by reducing percentage of embryos in the severe or mild defect group, which can not be rescued by control gfp mrna . moreover, we tested whether vegf overexpression would lead to increase of mtmr <dig> expression. as shown in figure  <dig>  when  <dig> pg vegf121+vegf  <dig> mrna was injected, ptc <dig> expression is not affected , but the expression of mtmr <dig> was up-regulated   in the injected embryos. we therefore conclude that mtmr <dig> expression in vasculature is dependent on vegf, and mtmr <dig> is essential for normal vasculature development through regulating hedgehog and vegf signaling pathways.

discussion
previous studies have showed that mutations in most myotubularin family genes are causative for human neuromuscular disorders <cit> . and, knockdown of zebrafish myotubularin and mtmr <dig> also impairs the embryo muscle development <cit> . moreover, mtmr <dig> has been shown to negatively regulate the pi3k/akt pathway <cit> . in the current study, we have further found that mtmr <dig> knockdown leads to activation of pi3k/akt signaling, which impairs arterial endothelial marker gene expression, and results in endothelial cell impairment and vasculogenesis defects. significantly, mtmr <dig> expression has been detected in somitic and lateral mesoderm, where the angioblasts are committed to endothelial lineage differentiation and restricted to arterial or venous fate <cit> . and, significant expression reduction of endothelial progenitor marker genes in mtmr <dig> morphants indicates that the impaired arterial differentiation should be the consequence of defects in endothelial cell formation. these results suggest that mtmr <dig> should be essential for the endothelial cell differentiation and vasculature development through repressing the activity of pi3k in zebrafish.

hedgehog signaling from notochord has been demonstrated to promote somitic expression of vegf, and thereby to promote expression of the artery-specific ephrinb <dig> in dorsal aorta <cit> . mtmr <dig> expression has been detected in somitic and lateral mesoderm, where angioblasts are restricted to arterial or venous fate, suggesting that the impaired arterial differentiation in mtmr <dig> morphants might be the consequence of defects in hedgehog/vegf signaling pathways. and, the expression of mtmr <dig> is significantly repressed in the embryos treated with inhibitor of vegf signaling pathway , suggesting that mtmr <dig> might act downstream of vegf to determine arterial cell fate. the concomitant down-regulation of ephrinb2a, ptc <dig> and vegf in mtmr <dig> morphants raises the possibility that mtmr <dig> acts upstream of hedgehog pathway. we hypothesize that mtmr <dig> regulates artery differentiation through two parallel ways . in one way, mtmr <dig> may act downstream of vegf. in other way, mtmr <dig>  hedgehog and vegf may control artery specification through a regulatory loop . in normal physiological condition, mtmr <dig> is a downstream factor of vegf signaling pathway, and is partially regulated by the hedgehog signaling pathway that is affected by the expression of mtmr <dig>  additionally, the down-expression of the hematovascular progenitor marker genes hbae <dig> and fli <dig> in mtmr <dig> morphants  suggests that mtmr <dig> might also regulate hematovascular progenitor specification and differentiation .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our findings indicate that mtmr <dig> functions as a key regulator of somitic muscle development and vasculature development in zebrafish embryos. the signaling pathways that function during vascular development are highly conserved. further analysis for mtmr <dig> function will be essential to understand the complex signaling hierarchy for the differentiation of endothelial cells and the development of vasculature in vertebrates.
