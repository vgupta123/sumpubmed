BACKGROUND
mitochondrial dna  polyploidy is a physiologic trait of human cells and implicates the possibility of the co-existence of different mtdna genotypes within the same cell, tissue, or individual, a condition known as heteroplasmy. up to date, quantification of heteroplasmy remains a challenging task in the characterization of mitochondrial variants and a limit for conventional sequencing methods  <cit> . the advent of next generation sequencing  technologies has revolutionized the field of genomics, providing the possibility of unprecedented large-scale and high-throughput analyses. indeed, massive-parallel sequencing implies ultra-deep yields, allowing the quantification of mitochondrial heteroplasmic variants  <cit> . one of the recent applications of ngs is whole exome sequencing , a powerful and quite cost-effective strategy to perform targeted deep sequencing of genomic protein coding regions  <cit> . even though the most recent wes protocols include the use of specific baits targeted to mtdna, the majority of kits currently used is devoted to the enrichment of nuclear-coding dna, while mtdna targeting has mostly been neglected  <cit> . nonetheless, it was recently demonstrated that the precious information of mitochondrial genotype may be retrieved from off-target dna in human wes studies, even when designed for nuclear dna exclusively  <cit> . it was indeed observed that the overlapping of nuclear probes onto nuclear mitochondrial sequences  determines a cross-hybridization of such baits with mtdna, which in turn is brought along as a 'contaminant'  <cit> . the natural abundance of the mitochondrial molecules in cells allows to achieve a high read depth, so that a recovery and assembly of the mtdna genome from nuclear wes studies is indeed feasible  <cit>  together with the quantification of heteroplasmy wherever the mitochondrial genome is sufficiently covered.

the relevance of estimating mitochondrial heteroplasmy is further highlighted by the fact that mtdna mutations exert their phenotypic effect above a certain mutation load threshold  <cit> , which may vary depending on the type of change  <cit>  and tissue. indeed, several studies demonstrated that mtdna mutations are functionally recessive until the mutant load exceeds a specific threshold and leads to a biochemical dysfunction  <cit> . in fact mitochondrial mutations are largely involved in various diseases, aging and cancer  <cit> . in addition, the finest quantification of heteroplasmy among familiar lineages is helpful for forensic studies  <cit>  and to better understand mechanisms of intergenerational segregation, especially in the case of maternal transmission of mutations predisposing to mtdna disorders  <cit> .

even though since  <dig> it is known that heteroplasmy in normal individuals may not be a rare biological status  <cit> , only recent surveys on mitochondrial genotyping and heteroplasmy annotation with deep sequencing have revealed that in normal human cells a widespread heterogeneity of mtdna variants co-existence occurs in healthy subjects and varies among tissues  <cit> . moreover, a condition of 'universal heteroplasmy' was depicted by chinnery and colleagues in their recent work  <cit>  in which they observed, by using high-throughput technologies, the presence of very low-level heteroplasmic variants in related and unrelated individuals, likely due to inherited or somatic events, not predicted to be pathogenic.

so far, consistently with the limited sensitivity of strategies and with the restricted population sampling available for mitochondrial genotyping, commonly used mitochondrial portals and databases  <cit>  do not report heteroplasmy values for the mutations/variants whose fraction has been reported in literature. however, while such information is lacking in databases, nucleotide and amino acid sites variability is at least available within hmtdb  <cit>  as a valuable information that contributes both to the definition of haplogroups and to the recognition of private variants or mutations with a potential pathogenic role.

in this work we used a pipeline previously provided  <cit> , that we further implemented for insertions and deletions  calling and applied to the in silico extraction and characterization of mitochondrial dna from nuclear wes studies, comprising  <dig> exome samples of the  <dig> genomes project  <cit>  belonging to  <dig> different human populations.  <dig> genomes project wes studies represent one of the widest nuclear genomic resources available to the scientific community, yet strikingly, up to now, mtdna genotyping has been disregarded, despite the important contribution the small mitochondrial genome provides to the cell homeostasis. we were able to recover mtdna from all wes studies and to assemble the complete mitochondrial genome for the majority of analyzed samples. high quality metrics were used to filter mismatches and indels and related heteroplasmy values of filtered variants were recorded. we enriched these data with a functional characterization, firstly detecting haplogroup and non-haplogroup defining sites. variability estimation reported in the human mitochondrial database and predictions of pathogenicity  <cit>  were also applied to non-haplogroup defining variants, revealing an intriguingly heterogeneous scenario among populations. we also performed a comparison between lymphoblastoid cell lines  and blood-derived mitochondrial dna isolated from the group of available samples, in order to assess the possible presence of genotype differences among the two different dna sources, as previously tested for nuclear dna  <cit> . finally, in line with the recent finding of the widespread distribution of heteroplasmy among healthy individuals, we found a consistent enrichment, among all  <dig> human populations screened, of very low-levels heteroplasmies, mostly unshared between subjects and associated with very low variability values reported in hmtdb, which more likely represent a bulk of private variants carried by each individual.

methods
exome samples
we surveyed whole exome sequencing  datasets related to  <dig> individuals, available through the  <dig> genomes project site  <cit> . these individuals included  <dig> samples of the  <dig> genomes phase  <dig> data collection, while the remaining  <dig> were additional individuals , listed within the 2012-05- <dig> exome alignment index  <cit> , which comprised all the exome samples aligned by the consortium until then. our dataset included  <dig> females and  <dig> males, from  <dig> different populations in total . the set of samples was selected considering different criteria: sequences were all illumina paired-end reads whose mates were both mapped onto the references , using the burrows-wheeler aligner   <cit> . two different platforms for whole exome capture were used for the samples analyzed: seqcap ez human exome library v <dig>  and v <dig>  from nimblegen  and sureselect all exon v <dig> target enrichment from agilent   <cit> , whereas for four samples it was not possible to retrieve any information. all the information about our  <dig> samples was available through the  <dig> genomes web site  <cit> .

for each population the number of samples we considered and the mean coverage and depth of mitochondrial genomes we extracted from exome data, are reported. coverage and depth were estimated as average of scores in each sample belonging to the same population. mean coverage of assembled mitochondrial genomes ranges from  <dig>   to  <dig>  . mexicans show also the highest mean per base depth , while the minimum depth score is for kinh  mitochondrial genomes .

mitochondrial sequences recovery from  <dig> genomes wes studies, variant calling and heteroplasmy assessment
we adopted a pipeline previously published  <cit>  in order to recover mtdna from off-target sequences of wes studies, removing reads similar to numts   <cit>  and maintaining only reads with a univocal mapping onto the mitochondrial genome. original mitochondrial bam  files from the  <dig> genomes project were first converted in fastq files using the samtofastq module of the picard suite of tools   <cit>  to apply the abovementioned pipeline, which requires the usage of samtools   <cit> , gsnap   <cit>  and python  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . after read mapping on the mitochondrial genome, using rcrs as reference sequence, the markduplicates module of the picard tools was applied on obtained sam files in order to remove pcr duplicates. duplicates filtering was just recommended in the adopted pipeline, but we considered this step crucial for a correct allelic quantification in our analysis. we extended variant call analysis also to indels, since they were not completely taken into account by the pipeline we used. in particular, we observed that it was targeted only for the detection of homoplasmic deletions, disregarding heteroplasmic indels. moreover, the tool previously developed did not automatically quantify heteroplasmic fractions  that we instead implemented in our system. we thus implemented a workflow in python programming language to parse the sam file cigar string  <cit>  associated to each pairwise aligned read, holding information on indel events. mismatches were instead analyzed directly from the mtdnaassembly-table.txt output of the adopted pipeline. filtering of insertion events was performed using quality score  and read depth  cut-off values per position previously adopted  <cit> , whereas the goodness of a deletion event was evaluated on the basis of its 5bp-long upstream and downstream flanking region. indeed, a median qs≥ <dig> and rd≥ <dig> were required for the flanking regions to consider such deletion in the genome assembly. hf was assessed as the fraction of the variant read depth onto the total mitochondrial read depth of the same position  or of the 5' flanking position .

the adopted pipeline allowed also to produce a consensus mitochondrial sequence for each individual, including only mismatches equal or above a hf threshold of  <dig> , otherwise the corresponding iupac character for single nucleotide variants was reported  <cit> . this consensus was used for the haplogroup assignment and for the subsequent analysis of pathogenicity linked to non-synonymous mismatches considering also all those variants under the fixed threshold annotated with iupac code.

all mitochondrial unique variants detected in this study are reported in a bed  table , generated from a vcf file which is the output of the python script we developed for the detection of indels and heteroplasmic fraction of mitochondrial variants. the python script and the vcf file  are available upon request.

haplogroup assignment
haplogroup assignment of  <dig> mitochondrial consensus sequences was performed using the stand-alone mt-classifier tool, implemented in hmtdb  <cit> , which uses the reconstructed sapiens reference sequence   <cit>  as mitochondrial reference.

the samples were chosen among the best assembled mitochondrial genomes within our dataset, harboring less than  <dig> gaps in their sequence. the mt-classifier version used refers to the phylotree  <cit>  mtdna tree build  <dig> 

mitochondrial reference databases
variants identified within the analyzed dataset were compared with those already annotated within hmtdb  <cit>  and mitomap  <cit> .

site variability values calculated on mitochondrial nucleotide multi-aligned sequences from nearly  <dig>  healthy individuals, were downloaded from hmtdb web site  <cit> . variability scores contributed to the recognition of private variants or mutations with a potential pathogenic role: they ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  where low variability values may be suggestive of a novel haplogroup-defining variant or a rare disease-linked mutation, while high variability scores were owned by common alleles within genomes stored in hmtdb.

mitochondrial coding and control regions point mutations with reports of disease-associations were available in mitomap  <cit> .

pathogenicity predictions
pathogenicity predictions on variants identified within the analyzed dataset were estimated using mutpred  <cit> , polyphen- <dig>  <cit>  and snps&go  <cit>  online software, producing  <dig> different scores and related prediction classes for each variant. pathogenicity values, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  allowed discriminating between potentially pathogenic and neutral mutations. each of the abovementioned software presents a specific threshold of pathogenicity. we considered  <dig>  as threshold for high pathogenicity score by mutpred as suggested by pereira et al.  <cit>  and "disease" prediction class by the other ones.

hierarchical clustering analysis
a hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distance estimation was performed to evidence shared classes of heteroplasmy within individuals with the aim to identify a possible clusterization of samples belonging to the same population sharing a similar number of variants referred to the same heteroplasmic range. the heatmap representation was used to visualize hierarchical clustering by rows and columns, using a matrix of numbers of variants belonging to  <dig> different classes of heteroplasmy, as raw input data. the mapalette function from the marray r package version  <dig> . <dig> was used to define heatmap colors, while the heatmap r function was used to draw the heatmap.

lymphoblastoid cell lines and blood subsets
we identified  <dig> potential blood samples among our  <dig> best assembled mitochondrial genomes and chose  <dig> potential lcl samples on the basis of epstein-barr virus  coverage values provided by the consortium  <cit> . indeed an ebv coverage equal to  <dig> might indicate blood derived dna, while lcl samples were selected among those with the highest ebv coverage .

statistical analyses
spectra of variants  within blood and lcl samples were compared with one-tailed and two-tailed student t-tests. fisher's test was applied to the distributions of blood and lcl heteroplasmic variants within mitochondrial loci and also to the distributions of variants within the same datasets per class of heteroplasmic fractions.

RESULTS
coverage and quality of assembled mitochondrial genomes
we downloaded aligned exome data  related to  <dig> individuals of the  <dig> genomes project from the public repository  <cit> . sequence reads were extracted from the bam files and re-aligned to the human reference genomes to assemble mitochondrial genomes for all the samples by applying picardi's pipeline  <cit> .

the first step of our analysis was the assessment of quality and coverage of the reconstructed mitochondrial genomes. we found that 76% of them showed a nearly complete assembly . the robustness of the computational strategy we used was highlighted by the reduction of the read count  mapped to the reference mitochondrial genome with respect to the original annotation by the  <dig> genomes consortium. two different factors contributed to the reduction of the original number of reads, namely pcr duplicates removal and, particularly, numts filtering  <cit> , disregarded in the mapping step performed by the consortium.

the mitochondrial assembly showed different mean coverage values within the  <dig> analyzed populations : they ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % with respect to the entire mitochondrial genome. mean per base depth was also widely variable, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . detailed data about mitochondrial genome coverage of each sample are reported in additional file  <dig> 

coverage and quality score  statistics were performed for each mitochondrial locus by estimating median read depth and qs . as already reported  <cit> , a better efficiency in mitochondrial reads extraction was obtained with the agilent enrichment kit, as suggested by comparing the highest mitochondrial depth values obtained within the same locus  through the agilent  and the nimblegen samples . furthermore, agilent mitochondrial reads showed slightly higher mean qs than nimblegen , with the maximum and the minimum qs observed within the same loci, mt-ts <dig>  and mt-tr  respectively. intergenic regions within agilent and nimblegen samples presented the same trend of qs and coverage values as of d-loop and coding regions .

to verify the robustness of our protocol, we further selected a subset of  <dig> samples with a mitochondrial genome coverage >99%, which were previously analyzed with both low coverage whole genome sequencing   <cit>  and exome sequencing projects by the consortium  <cit> . the dataset included  <dig> samples for 14/ <dig> populations. none of the analyzed exome samples was found within the low coverage dataset for the remaining  <dig> populations. we considered the subset of  <dig> samples  with the aim of identifying possible disagreements about variants detected by the consortium and our pipeline. we were able to detect up to  <dig> % of mitochondrial variants per sample reported within the low coverage variant call format  file generated by the consortium , while 45/ <dig> were missed with exome samples as they were not sufficiently covered. moreover, on average  <dig> variants per sample were not identified within exome samples, although their positions were sufficiently covered, whereas we were able to find more than  <dig> variants per sample not previously annotated with low coverage analysis by the consortium. the latter were all heteroplasmic and about the 70% presented a hf< <dig> , proving the sensitivity of our pipeline.

haplogroup assignment of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes
the haplogroup assignment procedure helped to test the quality of reconstructed mitochondrial sequences, since the geographical areas of sampled individuals were known. to this aim, we selected  <dig> out of  <dig> samples , which were analyzed by applying the mt-classifier implemented in hmtdb  <cit> . generally the predicted haplogroups seemed to converge with individual ethnicity.

about 93% of the  <dig> reconstructed sequences presented a prediction reliability p_hg >90%, defined as the highest fraction of nph  according to phylotree  classification  <cit> ) over the total number of the haplogroup-defining expected sites   <cit> . this high percentage of true-positive haplogroup-defining variant sites confirmed the high sensitivity of our method. assigned haplogroups are reported in additional file  <dig> 

indels and mismatches recognition, mapping and in silico validation
an accurate analysis of indels and mismatches was carried out on our mitochondrial dataset, considering the role played by these mutation events in healthy and pathological samples  <cit> . in considering the values reported below it is important to take into account that the same event may be observed in diverse samples in a different heteroplasmic status. two hundred and fifteen unique mtdna indel events , mostly heteroplasmic, were firstly recognized within the  <dig> mitochondrial genomes analyzed , mapped onto the mitochondrial genome  and then compared with indels already annotated in mitochondrial databases  <cit>  .

about 56% samples harbored at least one deletion and 64% presented an insertion . the most common events were single-base insertions  and deletions involving up to  <dig> bases . however their distribution normalized to the length of each mitochondrial locus showed high peaks of indels ratio within the d-loop, while a lower number was present within coding regions, where frameshift mutations may be deleterious .

interestingly, a certain amount of deletions was detected also within genes for transfer rna. intergenic regions, not shown in figure  <dig>  included  <dig> heteroplasmic insertions,  <dig> heteroplasmic deletions and  <dig> homoplasmic deletions.

the majority of the indels identified  occurred within homopolymeric stretches , defined as regions with the same nucleotide in at least two adjacent positions. the shortest homopolymers harbored the highest number of indels, although 5-bases stretches presented high levels of both deletions and insertions too, with the exception of g-stretches. this result was quite expected considering the homopolymeric nucleotide compositional bias of the mitochondrial genome, and that almost all of the homopolymers  within the mitochondrial reference genomes  are represented by two-bases stretches. moreover, up to 25% of the identified indels mapped within mitochondrial tandem repeat regions, where the onset of mutational events is favored  <cit> .

the set of indels found was compared with those already annotated in mitochondrial databases  <cit> , validated through traditional sequencing methods, discriminating those found in healthy individuals from those in diseased patients. about 20% indels observed in our samples matched with those reported in hmtdb within healthy samples dataset and nearly 8% were annotated in patient genomes . as expected based on the ngs technologies power in detecting also low-level heteroplasmy  <cit> , the remaining 80% highlights that there was a clear-cut prevalence of novel deletions and insertions, which mostly spanned non-coding regions, even though coding regions were not completely devoid of them. interestingly, a single base insertion at the position  <dig> , single base deletions in  <dig>  and  <dig> , and the extended deletion in 303- <dig>  were present only in patients, but not yet associated to any disease  <cit> . with respect to the  <dig> insertions and  <dig> deletions reported in mitomap, some of them are associated to cancer or other diseases, i.e. a set of d-loop mutations  found in multiple tumor types, m.16189inst found in bladder tumor, m.310delt found in breast tumor), three indels events in the mitochondrial gene encoding 12s rrna, mt-rnr <dig>   and one deletion in the gene encoding for trna threonine, mt-tt,   <cit> .

statistics about homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mitochondrial events are here reported. events are discriminated between indels and mismatches. the percentages of homoplasmic and heteroplasmic observed variants annotated in healthy and patients genomes stored in hmtdb  <cit>  are reported. a fraction of variant sites was found as homoplasmic in any samples and heteroplasmic in others.

also  <dig> single base mismatches were detected within our samples, involving  <dig> unique positions , with an average of about  <dig> mismatches per sample. they were discriminated between  <dig> heteroplasmic and  <dig> homoplasmic alleles, whose normalized distributions are shown in figure  <dig>  such distributions are rather homogeneous among mitochondrial loci, without significant dissimilarities between the two types, with high peaks into non-coding regions. as well as for indels, we found about 40% mismatches positions spanning homopolymeric stretches and only 1% within mitochondrial variant nucleotide tandem repeats . the majority of single-base homoplasmic variants  was already described in healthy individuals  <cit>  and  <dig> % heteroplasmic ones were annotated in public databases in a homoplasmic state . a large fraction of hetero/homoplasmic mismatches  was also found in patients. statistics related to indels and mismatches are summarized in table  <dig> 

heteroplasmy analysis
we detected on average  <dig> homoplasmic and  <dig> heteroplasmic variants per sample . frequency of variants was estimated for eleven ranges of heteroplasmic fractions  . considering the mean number of variants for each range of heteroplasmy and the mean number of alternative alleles in each sample, homoplasmic variants represented the largest slice with respect to the whole set of alleles in an individual. there was a substantial preponderance of homoplasmies , quasi-homoplasmies  and low-level heteroplasmies , suggested also by a hierarchical clustering analysis . we did not observe correlation between clusters of heteroplasmic variants and sample geographical origin.

pathogenicity analysis of private mutations
after haplogroup assignment, we isolated more than  <dig> variants not defining the individual haplogroup, then functionally annotated. predictions of pathogenicity were carried out on the subset of  <dig> non-synonymous variant positions using mutpred  <cit> , polyphen- <dig>  <cit>  and snps&go  <cit>  tools with the aim of identifying potentially damaging alleles and their spread within the  <dig> populations . all the  <dig> missense mismatches were classified according to the ranges of heteroplasmy, so that  <dig> were homoplasmic and  <dig> heteroplasmic. above all, mt-nd <dig> appeared to harbor the highest frequency of non-synonymous changes. occurrence of variants in the reconstructed mitochondrial genomes was not exclusive for a particular world area, but generally a variable number of samples belonging to different populations shared the same homoplasmic and quasi-homoplasmic/highly heteroplasmic variants, while low-level heteroplasmies were detected only in single individuals and may hence be likely considered personal mutations. for example, the m.13105a>g event was shared by  <dig> samples belonging to  <dig> populations, with the lowest hf equal to  <dig>  . we focused only on  <dig> variant sites  predicted as probably pathogenic by at least one of the above mentioned software  and interestingly they all showed very low variability . among potentially damaging events, the lowest hf value was  <dig>  . the most shared variants within this subset were all in a homoplasmic/highly heteroplasmic state. only  <dig> non-shared mismatches were predicted as damaging mutations by the three software, and among them the m.3946g>a was also annotated in mitomap as associated to melas . they all presented a low variability value  and a hf ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

the complete list of mitochondrial unique variants identified is reported in additional file  <dig> 

analysis of lcls and blood samples
as previously observed for nuclear variants  <cit> , we hypothesized that lymphoblastoid cell lines  might have a higher rate of mitochondrial mutations than blood. similarly to what already performed for nuclear variants  <cit> , we attempted to identify relevant qualitative and quantitative gaps between variants found in  <dig> out of our  <dig> samples, among which  <dig> were supposed to be derived from blood and  <dig> from lcls . samples were not related in families, except for one ceu trio , and were representative of 18/ <dig> populations. we first considered variants occurrence within the two datasets and their localization in the mitochondrial genome, discriminating heteroplasmic and homoplasmic sites . frequencies were hence normalized to the length of mitochondrial loci, in order to eliminate biases related to length. the distribution of variants along mitochondrial loci showed that generally heteroplasmic and homoplasmic mutations occurred at the same loci, which was verified in both datasets. a statistical relevant difference between mitochondrial loci distributions of variants within the two types of samples was found for heteroplasmic , but not for homoplasmic variants . the total number of variants was estimated within the two subsets, discriminating also between indels and mismatches and considering their heteroplasmy status . minimal statistically relevant differences were detected between lcls and blood derived dna especially in relation to indels .

variant sites observed in the two different dna sources were associated with variability values estimated on nearly  <dig>  complete mitochondrial genome sequences  <cit>  . the trend was similar for blood and lcl samples: almost all of the variant positions displayed a very low variability  . positions showing high variability, i.e. those which were common in the sequenced genomes available at hmtdb  <cit> , were few and represented the 25% of total shared variants between the  <dig> datasets, while the majority of non-shared variants  displayed low variability. among low variability sites , we found only a minimal numerical difference in low-level heteroplasmy variants  enriched in lcls, albeit not supported by statistical significance .

the highest number of positions shows low variability , and although no statistically significant difference was observed between the lcls/blood overall distributions of variants, an enrichment in low-level heteroplasmies was detected in lcls low-variability variants.

in fact, upon analyzing lcls/blood heteroplasmy levels , we confirmed a lcls trend to accumulate low-level heteroplasmic variants , although a comparable average number of heteroplasmic variants per sample was reported for both lcl and blood samples . about 25% variants were shared by both subsets and in 80% cases they were homoplasmic.

a clear enrichment in very low-level heteroplasmic variant positions within the whole lcl dataset  may be observed.

discussion
in this paper we report the results obtained by capturing human mtdna sequences starting from  <dig> genomes whole exome sequencing  data specifically targeted to nuclear genes. wes has been commonly used with clinical aims since its first application  <cit> , although this technology has been also implemented in evolutionary comparison of genomes  <cit> . even though the most recent wes protocols include the use of specific baits targeted to the whole mitochondrial genome as well as the mitocarta set of nuclear genes  <cit> , the probe sets used in the majority of previously published wes studies excluded such baits, hence mtdna sequences have been considered by-products and thereby neglected.

for the first time, we here recovered the overlooked mitochondrial information and reconstructed a large number of human mitochondrial sequences from off-target exome data, thanks to the availability of population-scale sequence datasets offered by the  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . this was possible through the application of a bioinformatics pipeline aimed at assembling mitochondrial genomes from exome data and then at annotating insertions, deletions and mismatches, accompanied by their heteroplasmy fraction, a series of tasks that were not feasible so far and that are necessary when dealing with mtdna data. overall we managed to extract  <dig> assembled mtdna, testing the validity of the protocol on the basis of coverage and quality data of the mitochondrial genomes that were generated. further evidences of the robustness of our method were provided by the accurate haplogroup assignment, which reflected individual ethnicity, and by the comparison with the set of variants within  <dig> samples selected from the mtdna vcf of low-coverage whole genome sequencing data  <cit>  generated by the consortium. it has to be underlined that a fraction of mitochondrial variants  annotated in the low coverage report was not identified by our protocol. this discrepancy may be likely due to variant artefacts as a consequence of wes probes overlapping numts, which were not filtered out in the  <dig> genomes project. on the other hand whole genome sequencing protocols ensure the availability of probes mapping on the entire mitochondrial genome, therefore some missing variants derived from the exomes analyzed are linked to an incomplete covering of any mitochondrial genomes. another possible source of discrepancy may be represented by sequencing errors ruled out by our protocol as associated to quality scores lower than the minimum threshold required for variant calling. the analysis of the reconstructed mitochondrial genomes highlighted a widespread distribution of polymorphisms in healthy samples. noteworthy, a parallelism may be observed between the enrichment in damaging and probably damaging rare variants within nuclear low frequency alleles of the  <dig> genomes low coverage  <cit>  and exon pilot projects  <cit> , and the numerous group of mitochondrial pathogenic predicted alleles  <cit>  and mutations with a confirmed disease association  <cit> , detected in our dataset.

in fact, exon pilot rare variants  <cit>  observed among continents highlighted a reduction in the degree of allele sharing, as well as a very low variability was associated to homoplasmic/heteroplasmic mitochondrial variants we predicted as damaging, that were mainly observed in sparse unrelated individuals. although low variability may be affected by a bias in the world population sampling, this finding may suggest that, similarly to the nucleus, negative selection is acting on these mitochondrial sites.

furthermore, similarly to the results on nuclear dna reported by xue et al.  <cit> , a possible explanation of the presence of pathogenic mitochondrial variants in healthy samples in a heteroplasmic condition below the specific threshold for the onset of the disease  <cit> , at least at the time of recruitment, may be linked to the age of disease onset or to an incomplete penetrance due to the absence in the subject of other factors contributing to the disease; a further explanation may be linked to the presence of erroneous annotations of disease-associated variants in databases. indeed only a few variants are currently annotated as unequivocally disease-causative, i.e. mainly leber's hereditary optic neuropathy  and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes  mutations  <cit> , while there is a high degree of uncertainty about the correct disease association for most of the mitochondrial mutations reported in literature especially since most of the time functional studies are lacking. moreover, no information about the level of heteroplasmy is reported in mitochondrial databases and this is becoming an urgent need, considering the relationship between heteroplasmy threshold and clinical manifestation of the disease  <cit>  and the ever increasing power of ngs technology in detecting also minor alleles in heterogeneous pools of variants  <cit> . as recently shown and in line with our findings, a 'universal heteroplasmy' of low-level heteroplasmic variants is present in healthy humans  <cit> , which may not be disregarded. in this population-scale scenario of variety, a common event recorded within our dataset is length heteroplasmy, that is the coexistence of different lengths of the same homopolymeric stretch within the same individual, mainly occurring within mtdna control regions and present at a lower frequency in the coding regions. although coding regions are highly populated with homopolymeric stretches, the lower occurence of length heteroplasmic variants may be due to a negative selection process acting to avoid function disruption.

as general concerns were expressed about the use of lcls-derived dna for sequencing studies  <cit> , we further sought differences in lcl versus blood sample subsets. to the best of our knowledge, no previous study showed reports on lcls and blood mtdna comparison. although in our analyses we lacked paired samples of blood and lcls from the same subject, we disposed of numerous groups of blood and lcl samples from several unrelated individuals , however sufficient to identify qualitative and quantitative gaps between the two, considering that ebv transformation may result in low-level generation of de novo mutations  <cit> . several works on whole exome/genome sequencing of lcls/blood were all in agreement that the great majority of variants found in paired samples is shared   <cit> , except for a minimal percentage of de novo variants, also found in low-passages lcls  <cit> . a comparable result was observed in our mitochondrial blood/lcl samples: the average number of heteroplasmic variants per type of sample was the same , even though we solely observed a difference in the numerical distribution of heteroplasmic variants along mitochondrial loci . however 80% variants shared by both datasets  were homoplasmic and the only numerical, albeit not statistically significant discrepancy was recorded for very low-level heteroplasmic alleles , mostly enriched in lcls. moreover, low variability sites abound among non-shared variants, which belong to the low-level heteroplasmy range of variants observed also in blood samples, likely a more reliable dna source than lcls. this finding is consistent with the general observation among all  <dig> human populations screened in this study of a specific enrichment in very low-levels heteroplasmies and, in a mirrored fashion, quasi-homoplasmies . as indeed demonstrated for both pathogenic predicted and lcl/blood variants analyzed, the majority of low-levels heteroplasmies are unshared between individuals and also associated with very low variability, thus more likely represent a bulk of private variants carried by each individual, as previously suggested  <cit> . moreover, in this fashion, our analysis suggests reliability of  <dig> genomes lcl samples and more generally of early passage ebv-transformed lymphocytes for mitochondrial genotyping, although validation with specific molecular methods for the detection of low heteroplasmies  <cit>  and mtdna targeted resequencing of blood-lcl paired-samples would be recommended.

an interesting finding in our analyses concerned the detection of shared potentially pathogenic variants. these results raise several questions on the definition of pathogenicity for an mtdna change, a debate that has recently sparked within the mtdna community and that calls for an in-depth thinking. the pathogenicity parameters assigned to nuclear variants may not apply sic to mitochondrial ones, in the same fashion as the concept of polymorphism. because of the peculiarities of mitochondrial polyplasmic genetics, the assignment of pathogenicity ought to take into account the degree of heteroplasmy, the haplogroup/haplotype context, and even environmental factors. for instance, a report describes a common european variant as predisposing to breast cancer in african women, which puts a red alert sign on the need for clarification in this field  <cit> . overall, unless supported by clear-cut functional studies, mtdna variants ought not to be considered pathogenic independently on the abovementioned factors. these considerations also draw attention on the true existence of a variant. on one side, it appears striking that we detected a large number of previously unreported variants, in a database that contains nearly  <dig>  mitochondrial genomes, a large number of which at very low heteroplasmy levels. this may not appear surprising since they may be detected exclusively if highly sensitive methods are applied, such as deep sequencing. nonetheless, one ought to consider that the increasing sensitivity of sequencing strategies allows the detection of low heteroplasmy degrees, but a limit is reached across which it becomes impossible to distinguish between a true low heteroplasmy and errors, intuitively. from a biological standpoint, extremely low heteroplasmic variants, being these potentially pathogenic or not, may rarely have a physio-pathological meaning . we may not assume that all variants here detected in blood-extracted samples were germ-line, as blood is indeed a somatic tissue. with this in mind, one has to ask whether the occurrence of very low variants in a somatic tissue may be more than a completely random transient event, and therefore whether annotation of such variants is a necessary task. theoretically, every position in the mtdna may vary in a single copy and be detected before evolution or random drift act to amplify it or to revert it, therefore a consensus must be reached for annotation of very low heteroplasmic data.

overall, we believe that the accurate annotation of the heteroplasmy degree of mitochondrial variants, which is of paramount importance especially in clinical studies, should be better implemented in up-to-date mitochondrial databases. indeed, the combined use of several information, such as the health status of individuals, the biological source of dna, the heteroplasmic status of variants, the prediction of pathogenicity and the haplogroup assignment should be a valuable tool for the definition of general criteria of prioritization of mitochondrial disease-associated variants.

CONCLUSIONS
to the best of our knowledge, this is likely the most extended population-scale mitochondrial genotyping in humans, enriched with the estimation of heteroplasmies. we used a pipeline to extract and characterize mitochondrial genomes from  <dig> genomes whole exome sequencing data, previously disregarded in these individuals. the application of our protocol offers also the relevant opportunity to further use this information, coupled with the nuclear genotype, for nuclear/mitochondrial coevolution studies both in health and disease.

depth of coverage of  <dig> agilent samples and  <dig> nimblegen samples. for each analyzed sample the median depth of coverage was estimated within each mitochondrial locus, starting from per base depth values. a better efficiency in mitochondrial reads extraction was obtained with the agilent  kit of enrichment, as suggested by comparing the highest mitochondrial depth values obtained through the agilent  protocol with that reached by the nimblegen  samples within the same locus, mt-nd <dig>  mt-ts <dig>  and mt-tn  show the lowest depth through agilent and nimblegen capturing, respectively.

quality score of  <dig> agilent samples and  <dig> nimblegen samples. median quality score was estimated for each analyzed sample within each mitochondrial locus starting from quality score of single positions. agilent  mitochondrial reads show slightly higher qs than nimblegen : both capture technologies recorded the maximum score within the same locus, mt-ts <dig> , while the lowest value is within mt-tr . moreover agilent qss seem to have a more uniform trend than nimblegen ones.

indels identified in assembled mitochondrial genomes. the total number of heteroplasmic and homoplasmic indel events  recorded within the analyzed dataset is here reported. the frequency of each event was estimated considering the dataset size . fifty-three percent samples display an insertion in the same position, namely the m.310insc. over half of the total events was not carried by more than one sample. the previously reported annotation of these events in healthy and patients was made after consulting hmtdb  <cit>  and mitomap  <cit>  databases.

spectrum of mitochondrial mutations within the  <dig> analyzed samples. the number of mitochondrial variants identified in each sample is here reported. a sorting was made on the heteroplasmic/homoplasmic state and mutation type. average values and statistical tests results are reported at the end of the table. the mean number of variants was estimated within the whole dataset and also within the two subsets . p-value of significance referred to each class of variants  compared between blood and lcls. minimal differences were detected between the two types of samples, especially in relation to indels . the differences between mean values of heteroplasmic variants per sample in lcls  and in blood  were not statistically significant.

indels found within homopolymeric stretches. almost all of the identified indels  occur within homopolymeric stretches, defined as regions with the same nucleotide in at least two adjacent positions. the figure shows how indels are distributed on the basis of homopolymers length. the shortest homopolymers harbor the highest number of indels, although 5-bases stretches present high levels of both deletions and insertions too. low frequency of indel events was observed within g-stretches.

mismatches identified in assembled mitochondrial genomes. the total number of heteroplasmic  and homoplasmic  mismatches events recorded within the analyzed dataset is here reported. the number of samples harboring a specific mismatch in a heteroplasmic or homoplasmic state is also shown. about 84% samples display a mismatch in the same position , explained by the fact that this event is defined as one of the seven rare rcrs polymorphisms. over half of the total events was not harbored by more than  <dig> sample. the annotation of these events in healthy subjects and patients was made using data annotated in hmtdb  <cit>  and mitomap  <cit>  databases.

hierarchical clustering of heteroplasmic fractions. a hierarchical clustering based on euclidean distance was performed to evidence shared classes of heteroplasmy within individuals with the aim to identify a possible clusterization of samples belonging to the same population sharing a similar number of variants referred to the same heteroplasmic range. there is a substantial preponderance of homoplasmic variants , quasi-homoplasmies  and low-level heteroplasmies . the white area corresponds to samples carrying at most  <dig> variant, due to a poor mitochondrial genome coverage. the crowding of "leaves" in the lowest levels of the tree highlights lack of correlation among heteroplasmic clusters and the sample geographical origin.

non-synonymous changes within analyzed samples. after the haplogroup assignment,  <dig> non-synonymous variant positions were detected, which do not define the individual haplogroup. among them,  <dig> were found as homoplasmic and  <dig> as heteroplasmic. heteroplasmic fraction  of missense mismatches and samples ethnicity are reported.

functional annotation of non-synonymous mismatches in  <dig> samples. predictions of pathogenicity were carried out on  <dig> non-synonymous mismatches previously filtered, using mutpred  <cit> , polyphen- <dig>  <cit>  and snps&go  <cit>  tools. localization of mismatches, the homoplasmic/heteroplasmic state, the corresponding aminoacid change and nucleotide variability values estimated on nearly  <dig>  mitochondrial nucleotide multi-aligned sequences, downloaded from  <cit> , are reported. above all, mt-nd <dig> appeared to harbor the highest frequency of non-synonymous changes. all the variants predicted as probably pathogenic by at least one of the abovementioned software  show very low variability . only  <dig> non-shared mismatches were predicted as damaging mutations by the three software, and among them the m.3946g>a was also annotated in mitomap  <cit>  as associated to melas.
