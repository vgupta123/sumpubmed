BACKGROUND
one of the major challenges in molecular biology is to characterize the mechanisms governing the regulation of transcription. mechanisms of regulation can be broadly classified in three classes:  interaction of a control factor with dna,  interaction of a control factor with the transcriptional complex, and  epigenetic factors. in this paper we are interested in elucidating mechanisms that belong to the first class, in which transcription factor proteins modulate expression levels by binding to one or more specific sites in the promoter region of a gene. the problem of identifying in silico transcription factor binding sites  has been studied intensively. as a result a variety of algorithms and tools have been developed . typically, these methodologies involve obtaining a set of genes which are known to be co-expressed or functionally-related and searching for common  short "motifs" in their promoter regions. the underlying hypothesis is that co-expressed or functionally-related genes are expected to share common tfbs.

algorithms for motif discovery can be enumerative or alignment-based. enumerative techniques involve the enumeration of all the possible motifs in the promoters, the assignment of an appropriate score based on probabilistic models, and a criteria to select the most statistically significant motifs. alignment-based methods use probabilistic modeling and combinatorial optimization, e.g., expectation maximization or gibbs sampling, to identify sequence patterns that are over-represented in the context of the promoter regions. commonly used tools for motif discovery include meme  <cit> , weeder  <cit> , gibbs motif sampler  <cit>  and alignace  <cit> . in general, the discovery of very short or highly degenerated motifs remains statistically challenging. therefore, these tools have only a limited success when used alone, especially when the ~80% at-rich genome of the human malaria parasite is considered. in response to an urgent need to understand how p. falciparum regulates its genes, several ad-hoc techniques to discover cis-regulatory elements have been developed specifically for the malaria parasite. young et al.'s gene enrichment motif searching   <cit>  uses a hypergeometric-based scoring scheme and a position-specific weight matrix optimization procedure to identify putative motifs. the input to gems are twenty-one clusters of functionally related or co-expressed genes in p. falciparum. the ouput is  <dig> putative tfbs in promoter sequences and  <dig> tfbs in introns-derived sequences. the method proposed by wu et al.  <cit>  compares evolutionarily related species of plasmodium and uses orthologous sequences to identify conserved tfbs. the method identified  <dig> tfbs that partially overlap previously reported putative tfbs in p. falciparum  <cit> . elemento et al.  <cit>  propose an algorithm called finding informative regulatory elements  that measures the mutual information between sequences and gene expression profiles, which is used to select the most statistically significant motifs. while most of the experiments are carried out in saccharomyces cerevisiae, the authors report  <dig> putative tfbs in p. falciparum. iengar and joshi  <cit>  combined the strenght of meme  <cit> , alignace  <cit>  and weeder  <cit> , to identify putative tfbs in promoters of p. falciparum co-expressed genes. the authors used strict cut-offs and selected only motifs that were found by all three software tools. this study resulted in  <dig> sets of putative tfbs.

the success of computational tfbs discovery methods critically depends on the a priori knowledge about which genes are co-regulated or functionally-related and therefore more likely to share common tfbs. carrying out this step can be challenging because  gene functional annotation are often incomplete or inaccurate,  gene expression profiles are often limited to a subset of the genes or specific events during the cell cycle and  genome-wide expression data can be incomplete. for instance, p. falciparum has  <dig> protein-coding genes of which about  <dig> have no known function and only ~ <dig> have stable and constitutive expression profile. furthermore, gene clustering rely on the measurement of mrna steady state levels that are not a direct measure of transcriptional activity but reflect both mechanisms of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. as a consequence, the resulting clusters are likely to be incomplete or incorrect.

recent alternative approaches that exploit the chromatin structure information to identify tfbs are based on the observation that active tfbs are usually nucleosome-depleted. nucleosome occupancy data has already shown to improve the discovery of tfbs employed in a few model organisms . nucleosome information is typically used in combination with sequence sets generated by chip experiments and occasionally mrna expression profiles rather than alone. collecting all nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome would indeed generate a very high number of sequence sets without transcription-related specificity. to circumvent this problem, we propose to use dynamic changes of nucleosome occupancy  to build sets of genes that are likely to be co-regulated. we demonstrate the power of our approach in the context of the search for potential tfbs in p. falciparum's genome using nucleosome positioning data obtained at seven time points during the erythrocytic asexual cycle. this approach is general, and can be applied to any organism for which nucleosome occupancy data at various time points or under varying conditions are available. here, we identify  <dig> potential dna binding motifs in the human malaria parasite's genome, most of them being novel. these results represent a major resource for the human malaria parasite, with significant implications for future investigations.

RESULTS
methodology outline
in a previous analysis of the chromatin architecture in p. falciparum  <cit> , we used faire  coupled with next generation sequencing, or faire-seq, to study the variations of nucleosome occupancy across its intra-erythrocytic cycle. samples of p. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were collected with six-hours increment for  <dig> hours , which is the duration of one cycle of growth, replication, and maturation into multiplied invasive parasites. the parasites' chromatin status at all seven time points was analyzed by faire-seq. briefly, the method involves the chemical cross-linking of the chromatin followed by shearing, protein-free dna purification, and sequencing. faire-seq therefore isolates and reveals nucleosome-free regions of the genome. in general, we found that nucleosomes are more abundant within malaria gene bodies whereas promoters are relatively nucleosome-depleted . in that context, we analyzed the variations of chromatin availability  at the loci of two validated tfbs that are specific to apicomplexan ap2-related transcription factors  <cit> . we observed that the chromatin availability of these tfbs varies significantly across time  <cit> ; the presence/absence of nucleosomes masks/reveals the tfbs and thereby modulates the binding of the apiap <dig> transcription factors. these elements indicate that one should be looking for tfbs within the regions of the genome with variable faire-seq coverage. here, we analyze the regions of the p. falciparum genome covered by faire-seq sequenced reads with the highest variance of faire-seq coverage across the seven time points of the erythrocytic cycle - i.e., nucleosome-depleted regions that are potentially accessible to transcription factors in a cycle-dependent manner - to discover novel putative tfbs.

the faire-seq coverage within the functional window is then averaged for each time point, creating a seven-point chromatin availability profile for the considered gene these profiles are used for k-means clustering of the genes. using k =  <dig>  we obtained clusters of  <dig> to  <dig> genes, for an average of  <dig> genes per cluster . the sequence sets from the functional windows within the same cluster are used as input for the discovery of putative tfbs, hereafter called motifs. since the only experimentally-validated motifs for p. falciparum are either six or eight bp-long, we restricted the present analysis to motifs of six, seven and eight nucleotides in length. our method can however be used with motifs of any length.

for each cluster, all possible motifs of size six to eight nucleotides in length were searched within the functional windows of each gene. frequencies of each motif were then modelled according to a hypergeometric probability distribution that measures the chances that the frequency of a given motif would be observed if the input sequences would have been selected randomly. the hypergeometric enrichment score or hes captures the statistical significance of the over-representation of a given motif in a given group . motifs and their variants were selected according to their hes values. this step selected  <dig> 6-mers,  <dig> 7-mers, and  <dig>  8-mers in the p. falciparum genome.

in the next refinement step, we examined the representation of each selected motif in the genome. for each motif, we selected all the genes with at least one occurrence of the motif within their functional windows. this set of genes is the target gene cluster of a given motif. figure  <dig> shows the distribution of motifs representation according to the sizes of the target gene clusters. the majority of motifs are found within target gene clusters with sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  the average cluster size is  <dig> genes with a standard deviation of  <dig>  these observations are consistent with the fact that the distance between genes of larger clusters is higher than the one measured for clusters more restricted in size. such big clusters are likely to contain a more diluted and noisy information and thus to contain a lesser amount of potential motifs. we proceeded to another round of motif identification using our hes-based method applied to the functional windows of genes within their target clusters. in order to remove spurious motifs three filtering steps are carried out. first, motifs with a hes lower than the average hes for all motifs of the same length were excluded. the average values of hes for 6-, 7- and 8-mers were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. for our data set, this requirement on hes is significantly more stringent than application of the bonferroni correction coefficient for multiple testing. then we used phylogenetic conservation information. four other plasmodium species closely related to p. falciparum were considered in our analysis: plasmodium vivax , plasmodium berghei, plasmodium chabaudi, and plasmodium yoelii . a motif was retained for downstream analysis when its hes in corresponding orthologous genes was at least two  in at least one of the four orthologous species. to ensure that high orthologous hes were not due to a random chance, we applied a randomized analysis of orthologous hes that further reduced the list of potential candidates for true motifs. after the filtration step, a total of  <dig> 6-mers,  <dig> 7-mers and  <dig> 8-mers remained.

finally, since motifs are usually degenerated to various extents, they were regrouped according to their similarities measured by the tanimoto distance  <cit>  and the pearson coefficient of position weight matrix   <cit> . ultimately, the final list of degenerated motifs consisted of  <dig> putative sets, i.e.,  <dig> 6-mers,  <dig> 7-mers, and  <dig> 8-mers . our tool can provide different representations for a motif: as the list of mutants, as a position weight matrix , as a sequence logo or as a regular expression. this flexibility allows users to make an informed decision about which particular sequence of a motif to select in experimental validation.

we evaluated the performances of our method by comparison with previously published work. we analyzed the distribution of our motifs within the p. falciparum genome, looking for positional biases relative to transcription start sites and predicted promoters, and for enrichment in functional sets of genes built from gene ontology and gene expression profiles information.

comparison with previously proposed motifs
we compared our  <dig> candidate motifs with previously validated motifs  <cit> . more specifically, we examined the apiap <dig> transcription factor binding motifs for pf14_ <dig>  and pff0200c  reported in  <cit> , and the motif nggtgca associated with the gene invasion cluster  <cit> . a position weight matrix  was built for each of our motif sets and the various occurrences of the previously published motifs  <cit> . the pearson coefficient of corresponding pwms was used as similarity metric. results are summarized in table  <dig>  the top-scoring motif in our list had a similarity score of  <dig>  with pff0200c  <cit> . another of the motifs in our list matched the motif nggtgca  <cit>  with a similarity score of  <dig> . the most similar motif to pf14_ <dig> in our list was tatgcat with the similarity score of  <dig> . we further compared our list of  <dig> motif sets with the full list of  <dig> candidate motifs reported in  <cit>  and the  <dig> candidate motifs . the comparison was carried out by computing the pearson coefficient between the corresponding pwm and reporting only pairs that exceeded  <dig>  similarity. we found that  <dig> of our motif sets were highly similar to  <dig> of the motifs from  <cit> , and  <dig> of our motifs were similar to  <dig> of the motifs from  <cit>  . the fact that our list of motifs contains biologically validated motifs and that several motifs are shared with previous studies validates the exclusive use of chromatin structural change via faire-seq for the discovery of tfbs in an eukaryotic genome.

motifs vs. gene function
we analyzed the distribution of the motif sets identified by our method within functionally relevant groups of genes. we used  clusters of genes inferred from go annotations,   <dig> previously published functional clusters derived from the analysis of mrna profiles  <cit> , and  a view of the previous  <dig> clusters reduced to four gene expression  groups based on the morphological stage at which genes are expressed . these ge groups were previously published  <cit>  and correspond to clusters of genes grouped according to variations in faire-seq within their promoters across seven time points. in the following we generically refer to any of these three sets above as a functional gene set. we estimated motif enrichment within each functional gene set using hypergeometric statistics.

for each motif in our list we calculated the hes in a functional gene set by counting the number of occurrences of that motif within nucleosome-sized functional windows. statistically significant motifs were selected using a randomized analysis. for each motif,  <dig> random gene clusters were generated and hes were computed for motifs within their functional windows. in order to assess statistical significance, a z-score was calculated using the average and standard deviation of the hes distribution for the random clusters of the same size of the functional gene set. we considered a motif in a functional gene set to be statistically significant if the p-value associated with the hes and the p-value associated with the z-score were both lower than  <dig>  . figure  <dig> show the z-scores of motif enrichment in go-based clusters, the gene expression-inferred  <dig> functional clusters from  <cit> , and the related ge functional gene sets proposed by ponts et al  <cit> . observe that motifs are either not found within a functional gene set or many of them are found. increasing the length of the motif to  <dig> bp seems however to increase the specificity of the motif repartition by comparison with  <dig> and  <dig> bp-long motifs . here, we are facing the usual trade-off sensitivity vs. specificity, shorter k-mers allowing to discover more degenerated motifs but generating more false positives than longer ones with limited performances on motif variants. with regards to gene expression profiles-inferred functional gene sets, motifs are abundantly found at geiv whereas none was observed for genes within geii . similar results are observed when all  <dig> functional clusters are considered . geiv contains genes mostly involved in specialized stages of the parasite, i.e., invasive, sexual, and mosquito stages. geii consists of genes mostly involved in the asexual non-invasive forms of the parasite. the abundant presence of tfbs in geiv gene promoters may reflect a highly regulated pattern of gene expression in specialized stages of the parasite. in contrast, the scarcity of motifs in the promoters of genes expressed during the asexual non-invasive stages of the parasite is consistent with the hypothesis of broad expression of genes without the accurate intervention of specific transcription factors to modulate transcription efficiency. these observations are in agreement with previous studies showing  significant discrepancies between mrna levels and transcription rates  <cit> , and  major regulatory mechanisms in the human malaria parasite are chromatin dynamics  <cit>  and post-transcriptional regulations   <cit> . in summary, the enrichment analysis shows that the motifs identified by our chromatin structural change analysis via faire-seq approach are likely to be biologically meaningful.

positional bias of the motifs relative to tss and the predicted promoters
we conducted an analysis of positional bias relative to the transcription start site  and the predicted promoters reported in  <cit> . we first obtained the list of  <dig> annotated tss and  <dig> predicted promoters, the latter given as a single genomic position. then we calculated the number of occurrences of our motifs within a  <dig> bp window centered at the tss or the predicted promoter. figures  <dig> a and  <dig> b show the distribution of positional occurrences of our motifs relative to tss and predicted promoters, respectively. for comparison purposes, we computed the distribution of expected positional occurrences for our motifs if they were uniformly randomly distributed under an i.i.d. model . the observed probability density is shown in black and the expected in purple. as a preliminary observation, the presence of peaks in the observed probability density surrounding aligned tss and predicted promoters suggest that some of our motifs have a strong positional bias relative to tss and predicted promoters. the same analysis was carried out for the  <dig> candidate motifs proposed in  <cit>   and the statistical significance of any positional bias was investigated as previously proposed  <cit> .

briefly, for each motif we computed the distribution of its positional occurrences within  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp-long sliding window  inside a region  upstream of the tss or the predicted promoter  and  inside a  region centered at the tss or the predicted promoter. using the positional distribution of the motif in the background, we computed its p-value to test the null hypothesis that the total number of occurrences of the motif inside a sliding window of the region centered at tss  follows the distribution of the motif's occurrences inside a corresponding-size window in the background. we considered the number of occurrences of a motif inside a k-bases window  to be statistically significant if its p-value was at most  <dig> . table  <dig> shows the percentage of our motifs that showed statistically significant positional bias relative to tss. for comparison, we also provide the same analysis for the  <dig> motifs from  <cit>  that showed statistically significant positional bias to tss. observe that the percentage of motifs with positional bias towards tss are overall stronger for our motifs sets than for the set proposed by young et al.  <cit> . this positional preference seems to be also stronger with regards to the predicted promoters. these results indicate that using faire-seq profiles-based clustering for motif discovery could produce a more meaningful set of motifs than gene expression-based approaches.

although the functional windows are chosen within  <dig> bases upstream of the first codon independent of the tss positions, we investigated whether the strong positional bias of our motifs relative to the tss was influenced by the locations of the functional windows. regions with the highest variance of faire-seq coverage are expected to correlate with the position of the tss, due to the coupling between the patterns of nucleosome occupancy and positioning preference of the transcription initiation complex. the positional distribution of the centers of the functional windows relative to tss confirmed this hypothesis . there are two factors that contribute for the positional enrichment of motifs with respect to the tss: the locations of the functional windows relative to tss and the positions of the motif within the functional windows.

CONCLUSIONS
the human malaria parasite has highly skewed nucleotide distribution  that together with the fact that over 40% of all genes have no known function makes in silico tfbs discovery challenging. here we have demonstrated that chromatin structure data can be used in the context of an enumerative motif approach for successful in silico discovery of regulatory elements.

in our previous analysis of the dynamic chromatin structure in the human malaria parasite  <cit>  we observed that faire-seq coverage surrounding a validated tfbs varies drastically throughout the erythrocytic cycle. another important observation was that most of the genes had well-defined faire-seq peaks within their promoters, and while the intensity of the peaks changed across the time points, their locations relative to the start codons remained unchanged. given these observations, we formulated the hypothesis that the most likely regions containing tfbs are the windows within the promoters with the highest variance in the faire-seq coverage.

we tested this hypothesis by developing a new methodology for in silico motif discovery using faire-seq coverage. our approach resulted in the finding of  <dig> putative motifs, including many of the motifs proposed by previous studies  <cit> . moreover, half of the motifs that we propose are over-represented within particular functional gene sets, especially genes involved in specialized stages of the parasite such as its sexual or invasive form. our motifs also showed stronger positional bias relative to the promoter region compared to previously proposed set of motifs. these putative motifs together with their associative target clusters can serve as starting points in future research on characterization of unannotated proteins and regulatory mechanisms. in summary, our data confirm the importance of chromatin structural changes to regulate gene expression in the human malaria parasite. precise knowledge of gene regulation pathways in the human malaria parasite will be essential for developing novel therapeutic strategies.
