BACKGROUND
defensin genes encode a family of small cationic peptides that act as antimicrobial mediators of the innate immune system  <cit> . defensins are arginine-rich peptides and invariably contain disulfide-linked cysteine residues, whose positions are conserved  <cit> . the two main defensin subfamilies, α- and β-defensins, differ in the length of the peptide segments between cysteine residues and in the arrangement of disulphide bonds that link them. β-defensins have been found in most vertebrate species, whereas α-defensins are specific to mammals  <cit> . based on their adjacent chromosomal location, similar precursor peptides and gene structures, it has been postulated that all vertebrate defensins arose from a common gene precursor  <cit> . while the efficacy of individual defensins against specific infectious agents varies, they have shown antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses  <cit> . at high concentrations, some defensins are also cytotoxic to mammalian cells, as cells exposed to high amounts of defensins in inflamed tissues generate pro-inflammatory signals that can contribute to tissue injury  <cit> . in humans, most of the genes encoding α- and β-defensins are located in clusters on chromosome 8p <dig>   <cit> . within the region, two different defensin clusters can be distinguished: a telomeric cluster mostly containing α-defensin genes  and at least two centromeric clusters of β-defensin genes   <cit> .

chromosome band 8p <dig>  is known to be a frequent site of chromosomal rearrangements mediated by low copy repeats  or segmental duplications . it has been described that as many as one in four individuals from the general population carry a  <dig>  megabase  inversion of the region  <cit> . in addition, copy number variability involving both α-defensin  and β-defensin  genes in chromosome 8p <dig>  has been well detected and characterized  <cit> . the number of defa <dig> and defa <dig> gene copies has been reported to range from  <dig> to  <dig> in a sample of  <dig> subjects, the defa <dig> allele being completely absent in 10% of them  <cit> . gene nomenclature for defa <dig>  deft <dig> and defa <dig> has been replaced by defa1a <dig>  following recommendations of aldred et al, since these genes have been considered as being part of a copy number variant  region  <cit> . in another study, linzmeier and colleagues determined copy numbers of the defa <dig> and defa <dig> alleles in  <dig> subjects and found between  <dig> and  <dig> copies per diploid genome, with defa <dig> being absent in 26% of them  <cit> .

despite defa <dig> and defa <dig> being considered as members of the same cnv , they encode different peptides, hnp- <dig> and hnp- <dig>  respectively. the mature hnp- <dig> and hnp- <dig> peptides differ only in their n-terminal amino acid, due to a single nucleotide difference, c3400a, between the defa <dig> and the defa <dig> genes  <cit> . this c3400a is a paralogous sequence variant  that allows discrimination between the two gene copies. the hnp- <dig> peptide is identical to the last  <dig> amino acids of both the hnp- <dig> and the hnp- <dig> peptides. hnp- <dig> is presumably produced from prohnp- <dig> and/or prohnp- <dig> by post-translational proteolytic cleavage  <cit> . it is likely that one or both genes, or another member of the defa1a <dig> cnv cluster encode the hnp- <dig> peptide. the three peptides are constitutively produced by neutrophil cell precursors and packaged in granules before mature neutrophils are released into the blood. during phagocytosis, the defensin-containing granules fuse to phagocytic vacuoles where defensins act as antimicrobial agents  <cit> .

recent work has shown that cnvs are a major source of genetic variation  <cit> . individual variability in resistance to infectious diseases has been extensively reported  <cit> . however, the causes of this diversity in immune function are poorly understood. cnvs involving immune genes could contribute to the differences in innate immunity between individuals and influence predisposition and susceptibility to diseases, as it has been shown for human immunodeficiency virus and aids  <cit> . thus, it is important to analyze the impact of defensin gene cnvs on human health, both in healthy volunteers and in patients with disease  <cit> . in this report we have studied the presence of defa <dig> in samples from different human populations. for this purpose, we used the international haplotype map  project collection and a cohort of spanish healthy individuals.

RESULTS
differences in the proportion of defa <dig> absence between populations
we have analyzed  <dig> samples from four populations with ancestry in europe, africa or asia , including spanish healthy individuals. the source used for this study was the hapmap collection of  <dig> samples utilized by the international hapmap consortium for the study of human genomic variation, initially through the investigation of snps and their associated haplotypes  <cit> , and  <dig> additional hapmap samples. this collection comprises four populations:  <dig> parent-offspring trios  of the yoruba from ibadan, nigeria ,  <dig> parent-offspring trios  of european descent from utah, usa ,  <dig> unrelated japanese from tokyo, japan  and  <dig> unrelated han chinese from beijing, china . in addition,  <dig> yoruban trios,  <dig> unrelated japanese and  <dig> unrelated chinese from the hapmap collection, but not genotyped in the hapmap project, were analyzed. the spanish samples were  <dig> unrelated blood donor controls, all of caucasian origin. genomic dna from ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid cell-lines was used. as chinese and japanese allele frequencies are found to be very similar  <cit> , the analysis was performed combining both datasets, resulting in four different groups of samples tested: two caucasian groups , yoruba and chinese/japanese.

the coding sequence of defa <dig> and defa <dig> differs only by a single nucleotide , which allows distinguishing between defa <dig> and defa <dig> by haeiii digestion, since a restriction site for this enzyme is absent in the defa <dig> sequence. all samples had at least one defa <dig> copy, but defa <dig> was absent in several subjects of all populations. defa <dig> was absent in different proportions depending on the population tested, ranging from 10% in the chinese/japanese dataset to 37% in the yoruba samples . there were statistically significant differences for the absence of defa <dig> when comparing yoruba samples with each of the other population groups  or with the total of non-yoruban unrelated subjects . as both caucasian and yoruba samples are trios, inheritance of the defa <dig> allele could also be assessed, showing no abnormal segregation in any of the trios analyzed .

segmental duplications and genomic organization of α-defensin cluster
the genomic organization of the α-defensin cluster was precisely defined by pipmaker analysis  <cit> . for this analysis, a region of  <dig> kb containing the whole α-defensin cluster on 8p <dig>  was used . the alignment of the region against itself identified different sequences with high homology, which correspond to six α-defensin genes , six α-defensin pseudogenes  and one θ-defensin pseudogene  . such clustered organization of α-defensin genes is common in other species, suggesting that α-defensin have arisen from a common ancestor by gene duplication followed by diversification  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of all human α-defensin genes and pseudogenes showed that defa <dig> and defa <dig> seem to be the ancestral genes. all pseudogenes are clustered together with these two genes, with the exception of defa10p and deft1p, which are closely related with defa <dig> and defa <dig> .

three copies of a 19-kb repeat unit were identified within the α-defensin cluster, which correspond to the defa1a <dig> cnv, previously reported to be variable in copy number between individuals   <cit> . each of the 19-kb repeats contained a copy of the defa <dig> or defa <dig> genes, together with a pseudogene, either defa10p or deft <dig>  defa10p and deft1p have a high sequence identity and are closely related in the phylogenetic analysis, which is in accordance with the theory that primate specific θ-defensins evolved from α-defensins after divergence of the primates from other mammalian species  <cit>  . variation in both number and position of defa <dig> and defa <dig> alleles has been reported, indicating that these genes are located in interchangeable variant cassettes within tandem gene arrays  <cit> . thus, the existing diversity in defa1/defa <dig> copy number and localization is probably the result of unequal crossing-over events between tandem arrays  <cit> . interestingly, multiple copies of defa <dig>  but not the defa <dig> gene, can be in silico identified in chimpanzee by blast sequence similarity searches. on the other hand, in the case of rhesus macaque the defa <dig> gene is present in multiple copies, suggesting a different evolutionary pattern driven by the responses to specific microbial challenges  <cit> .

hapmap samples have been tested for the presence of cnvs by two different techniques affymetrix snp array and bac array  <cit> . defa1a <dig> region was identified as a cnv in  <dig> subjects , but only in four cases where a gain or loss was detected, defa <dig> is absent. copy number variation in the defa1a <dig> region is reported to be much more common than the variation identified by redon et al  <cit> . however, the small size of the defa1a <dig> cnv makes it undetectable with bac arrays. moreover, the presence of segmental duplications in the region entails a bad snp coverage of the region by the affymetrix snp array, which does not allow an accurate detection of the cnv. thus, the study of this cnv for association purposes has to be performed by quantitative methods or by the analysis of paralogous sequence variants.

patterns of linkage disequilibrium for defa1a <dig> in hapmap samples
a region of  <dig> kb, spanning from  <dig> , <dig> bp to  <dig> , <dig> bp, which contains the defa1a <dig> cluster and the single copy gene defa <dig> was chosen for the linkage disequilibrium analysis  . the hapmap data for the defa1a <dig> region included around  <dig> snps for each population . however, only  <dig> of the snps had genotype data in all four populations. interestingly, almost all genotyped snps are located outside the defa1a <dig> cluster . the absence of genotyped snps in the defa1a <dig> cluster is in agreement with the presence of segmental duplications that include the defa1a <dig> genes. thus, the non-homogeneous distribution of snps within the region could be at least partially explained by the presence of high homologous repeated sequences. genotyping errors enhanced by the presence of defa1/defa <dig> tandem gene arrays could have lead investigators to discard snps located within this region.

of the  <dig> snps analyzed in all four populations,  <dig> were monomorphic in at least one of them . monomorphic snps can be used to measure genetic variability, by analyzing their distribution in the different populations. the chinese and japanese groups had the highest proportion of monomorphic snps  which was very similar to that observed for caucasian samples , whereas the yoruba samples had the smallest number of monomorphic snps . this indicates that genetic variability is higher within yoruba samples, while chinese/japanese and caucasian populations show similar proportions of genetic variability. this higher variability for yoruba samples is similar to that detected in the hapmap analysis for the whole genome  <cit> . interestingly, the proportion of monomorphic snps in this region is about 10% higher for each population group than the average reported for the hapmap data  <cit> .

the patterns of linkage disequilibrium  in each population are summarized in figure  <dig>  the yoruba samples show the lowest ld, the greatest variability and smaller haploblocks compared to caucasian or chinese/japanese samples, which have similar patterns of ld. the differences observed in ld patterns between populations are in accordance with defa <dig> locus absence results; the yoruba samples showing highest ld variability and also having the highest proportion of defa <dig> absence.

defa1a <dig> region haplotype association with defa <dig> absence in hapmap samples
to assess whether defa <dig> is inherited together with neighbor snps, an association study was performed using the hapmap data for the 100-kb region including the defa1a <dig> cluster. all the snps of the region genotyped in the hapmap project were tested for association with the c3400a psv, which defines the presence or absence of defa <dig> gene, respectively. no association for any of the genotyped snps was found in the yoruba or japanese/chinese populations. however, a significant association was found between absence of defa <dig> and  <dig> snps in the caucasian samples, under a recessive mode of inheritance . association between estimated haplotypes within defined ld blocks and the c3400a psv has also been tested. again, the caucasian group was the only one in which significant association was obtained . moreover, the associated haplotype spans nearly the whole 100-kb region, indicating a lack of recombination between the ld blocks when defa <dig> gene is absent. the frequency of defa <dig> lacking haplotype's would be similar to that estimated by the haploview program, which varies from 16%–33% depending on the haplotype block . this estimation correlates well with the observed frequency of defa <dig> absence in caucasians .

discussion
several studies have recently reported a previously unknown high prevalence of copy number variation in humans  <cit> . a recent study of cnvs in the hapmap samples has defined over  <dig> cnv regions  <cit> . on average, each individual varies at over  <dig> cnvs, representing about  <dig> mb of genomic dna difference. it has been suggested that cnvs account for a significant proportion of human normal phenotypic variation. it is thought that cnvs may also have an important role in the pathological variation in the human population  <cit> . analyses of the functional attributes of currently known cnvs reveal a remarkable enrichment for genes that are relevant to molecular-environmental interactions and genes that influence response to specific environmental stimuli, such as genes involved in immune response and inflammation  <cit> .

cnvs involving α- and β-defensin genes  in the 8p <dig>  region have been extensively characterized  <cit> . from a pathologic point of view, it is likely that α- and/or β-defensin cnvs affect the function and effectiveness of innate immunity. such effects could be influenced by the frequent absence of the defa <dig> allele. in the present work, we have tested the absence of the defa <dig> allele in different human populations, finding significant differences between them, which could be indicative of differences in innate immune function between populations. this is not surprising since the different human population groups have been exposed to different environments regarding infectious agents and other factors. one obvious way by which cnvs result in human phenotypic diversity is by altering the transcriptional levels of the genes which vary in copy number  <cit> . in addition, it has been postulated that retention of duplicate genes, rather than mutation to pseudogenes or neofunctionalization, is due to the generation of increased amounts of a beneficial product  <cit> . this could be the case of defa1a <dig> in which variation in defa <dig> and defa <dig> copy number, and defa <dig> absence could underlie variable resistance to infection among individuals. different selective pressures acting in each geographic region could likely explain population differences in defa <dig> absence.

taudien and colleagues by manual clone-by-clone alignment significantly improved the assembly of defensin 8p <dig>  locus, providing in silico evidences of the experimentally verified variability in defensin copy number and better representing the locus diversity  <cit> . the exceptional genomic complexity and heterogeneity of the human 8p <dig>  locus and the prominent role of defensins in the innate immunity framework raise the question of whether individual patterns of haplotypes, together with the variability in defensin genes copy number, affect the functionality of the defensin system. to address this issue, taudien et al provided a molecular approach for the determination of individual defensin gene repertoires limited to 8p <dig>  β-defensin clusters and using data from a  <dig> bp fragment in  <dig> individuals  <cit> . in our case, we have characterized in detail the haplotype diversity and ld structure of a 100-kb region around α-defensin locus in  <dig> hapmap samples. the snp distribution of the region is characteristic of the presence of segmental duplications, which result in a low-density of snps selected for genotyping. as previously reported for other genomic regions  <cit> , the yoruba samples present a higher variability than both the chinese/japanese and caucasian samples. additionally, in the yoruban, the haploblock structures were smaller and the extent of ld between snps was lower, in accordance with the out-of-africa theory for the origins of humans. the observation that the proportion of subjects lacking the defa <dig> gene is greater in yoruba samples together with the fact that defa <dig> is thought to be human specific  <cit>  may be an indication of the higher amount of original genetic variation among the first humans living in africa, which afterwards migrated to other continents. the initial migration occurred as multiple, branching events and involved many founder effects in which certain haplotypes, snps and alleles appear to have increased in frequency in emigrant populations owing to genetic drift and different selection pressures  <cit> . in this sense, we observed a diminished frequency of subjects without defa <dig> in caucasian and asian samples.

when association with defa <dig> absence was tested, snps and haplotypes in the caucasian population were the only ones to be significant. the association observed in the caucasian samples could be the result of strong founder effect. founder effects and, particularly, the decrease in genetic diversity resulting from continental migrations, are associated with an increased haplotype length  <cit> . this is observed when comparing the haplotype block patterns of the different populations analyzed, in which the caucasian samples set has the longest haplotype blocks. alternatively, aldred and colleagues demonstrated that defa <dig> has arisen at the 5' end repeat position and has transferred to other positions within the array through unequal recombination between alleles  <cit> , suggesting that recombination has been active in shaping diversity in the defa1a <dig> locus. however, our results indicate that, at least in the caucasian samples, there has been little recombination between chromosomes with and without defa <dig>  as we are able to find a haplotype associated with defa <dig> absence extending for nearly 100-kb. moreover, as for defa <dig> absence, other haplotypes are likely to be associated with other patterns of cnv polymorphisms. however, other situations cannot be rule out without analyzing large pedigrees to determine unambiguously each chromosome structure at defa1a <dig> cnv.

the impact on human health of this qualitative variation in the presence of the defa <dig> gene product deserves to be explored in epidemiologic studies. different studies have described differences in the function and specificity of defa <dig> and defa <dig> gene products, hnp <dig> and hnp <dig>  <cit> . in general, hnp <dig> is thought to be less active than hnp <dig> against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> , but it is expressed at about twice the level of hnp <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, defa <dig> but not defa <dig>  has been found upregulated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that defa <dig> upregulation might be a general feature of autoimmune diseases  <cit> . therefore, the observed differences in defa <dig> absence may partially explain the different population incidences of infectious and/or autoimmune diseases in which defa <dig> plays an important role. future studies are needed to establish whether patterns of defa <dig> absence correlate with certain population microbial exposures or different prevalence of autoimmune disorders. this could also be important in determining the exact nature of defa <dig> function and its specificity of action, if any, against certain antigens. last, but not least, further studies focused on the determination of the total copy number of defa1a <dig> units will be crucial to build the complete picture of defa1a <dig> cnvs' impact on human health.

CONCLUSIONS
complexity and variability are essential genomic features of the α-defensin cluster at 8p <dig>  region. the present work gains insight into the existent variability in human populations in this specific region. the identification of population differences in the proportion of subjects lacking the defa <dig> gene may be suggestive of population-specific selective pressures, which should be studied in further inter-population epidemiological studies.
