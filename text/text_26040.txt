BACKGROUND
atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall. from the first appearance of fatty streaks through to the development of advanced atheromatous plaques, atherosclerosis involves interactions between the immune system and metabolic risk factors. the immune and inflammatory actions of monocytes/macrophages play an important role in this disease  <cit> . peripheral blood monocytes enter the arterial tunica intima, where they differentiate into macrophages or immature dendritic cells  that differentiate fully after exposure to environmental factors  <cit> . we have shown in vitro that oxidized low-density lipoprotein  stimulates mature macrophages to differentiate into dc  <cit> , a process that might be important for inflammatory and immune responses within the atheroma. although there is currently no in vivo evidence for macrophage–dc differentiation, the functional consequences of this event might significantly exacerbate inflammation in the atheroma. the molecular mechanisms underlying macrophage–dc differentiation is essential for our understanding of atherogenesis and the development of novel drug therapies.

the orphan nuclear receptor nur <dig>  also known as nr4a <dig>  ngfi-b or tr <dig>  is a member of the steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily, and was first identified as an early response gene to growth factor stimulation. these nuclear receptors are all transcription factors characterized by three main functional domains: a dna-binding domain , which is flanked by an amino-terminal transactivation domain, and a carboxy-terminal hetero-dimerization and ligand binding domain. nur <dig> is an orphan receptor since no specific ligands have been identified. previous studies have identified diverse roles for nur <dig> in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, as well as neuroendocrine regulation, neurological disorders, liver regeneration and cancer. nur <dig> is expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions, and can be induced in human smooth muscle cells, macrophages and endothelial cells  <cit> . pei lm et al.  <cit>  found that many inflammatory stimuli, including oxldl, elevate expression of nur <dig> in macrophages in vitro, and we have found that nur <dig> is upregulated in macrophages exposed to oxldl  <cit> .

here, we have used in vitro approaches to investigate a possible role for nur <dig> in oxldl-induced macrophage–dc differentiation. we show that overexpression of nur <dig> significantly inhibited the differentiation into dc of the raw <dig>  macrophage cells exposed to oxldl. analysis of deletion mutants of nur <dig> indicated that the nur <dig> dna binding and transactivation domains were both required for this suppressive effect.

RESULTS
establishment of stable raw <dig>  cell lines expressing gfp-nur <dig> and gfp-nur <dig> deletion mutants
we have shown previously that macrophages exposed to oxldl in vitro differentiate into mature dc. here, we have investigated a possible role for the orphan nuclear receptor nur <dig> on the differentiation of oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells, a murine macrophage cell line. nur <dig>  a steroid/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor superfamily, contains three characteristic functional domains involved in transactivation, dna binding, and ligand binding . we established clonal raw <dig>  cell lines stably expressing either wild-type gfp-nur <dig> or gfp fusion proteins with nur <dig> lacking either the transactivation or dna binding domains . gfp-nur <dig> expression was 3– <dig> fold the level of endogenous nur <dig> . the two deletion mutants of nur <dig> were expressed to similar extents . fluorescent microscopy revealed that gfp-nur77-Δdbd was cytosolic, whereas gfp-nur <dig> and gfp-nur77-Δtad were strictly nuclear  suggesting that dna binding is required for nuclear localization.figure  <dig>

nur <dig> inhibits the differentiation of oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells
we tested the effects of oxldl on the morphology, dc surface marker expression, endocytic activity, allostimulatory activity, and cytokine secretion of the raw <dig>  stable cell lines. consistent with previous results,  <dig> % of gfp control cells had dc morphology after oxldl treatment as determined by increased cell size, the presence of multiple prominent cytoplasmic processes, and prominent nucleoli . in contrast, although most gfp-nur77-expressing cells increased in size, only  <dig> % had dc morphology following oxldl treatment. in contrast,  <dig> % oxldl-treated gfp-nur77-Δtad or  <dig> % of oxldl-treated gfp-nur77-Δdbd cell lines were of dc morphology, which was similar to control gfp-expressing cells . there was a small but statistically significant increase in the proportion of dcs in gfp-nur77-Δdbd cells compared to gfp-expressing cells . to determine whether endogenous nur <dig> played a role in macrophage–dc differentiation, we used sirnas to deplete nur <dig> and assayed the effect on oxldl-induced morphological changes. transfection of nur <dig> sirna successfully depleted endogenous nur <dig> in raw <dig>  cells compared to the scrambled sirna  and led to a 17% increase in the proportion of cells with dc morphology following oxldl treatment compared to that in the scrambled sirna group .figure  <dig>

to provide definitive evidence to the observed morphology, cd <dig> was tested by confocal microscopy. .

nur <dig> inhibits phenotypic changes in oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells
the changes in cell morphology described above suggest that nur <dig> inhibits oxldl-induced raw <dig>  cell differentiation into dcs through its dna binding and transactivation domains. to investigate this possibility, we evaluated phenotypic changes in oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells stably expressing nur <dig> and nur <dig> mutant proteins by flow cytometry using specific antibodies against co-stimulatory molecules, antigen-presenting molecules, and markers of dc activation. following oxldl treatment, the levels of cd <dig>  cd <dig>  cd <dig>  mhc class ii, and cd1d were reduced by  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively, in raw <dig>  cells stably expressing gfp-nur <dig> protein compared with those in gfp-expressing cells. however, there was little difference in the levels of these proteins when comparing cells expressing either gfp-nur77-Δtad or gfp-nur77-Δdbd with gfp-expressing cells, with the exception that gfp-nur77-Δdbd cells had a small but significant increase in the expression of cd <dig>  mhc class ii molecules, and cd1d . moreover, all of the aforementioned proteins were significantly up-regulated in nur77-depleted raw <dig>  cells when compared to control cells transfected with scrambled sirna .figure  <dig>

nur <dig> decreased endocytosis in oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells
we have previously shown that oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells gain several of the functional characteristics of mature dc  <cit> . therefore, we next assayed the role of nur <dig> in these oxldl-induced functional changes. using ly uptake as a marker of endocytosis , we found that a large proportion of the four stable raw <dig>  cell lines were ly + following 12 h exposure to oxldl. consistent with published results, oxldl had a dynamic effect on endocytosis. gfp-expressing controlcells exhibited decreased ly uptake by approximately 33% at 24 h and 57% at 48 h after oxldl treatment. similar results were obtained from gfp-nur77-Δtad and gfp-nur77-Δdbd-expressing cells, except that at 48 h ly uptake by gfp-nur77-Δdbd-expressing cells was 15% lower than gfp-expressing cells. in contrast, oxldl had little effect on ly uptake in gfp-nur77-expressing cells at either 24 h or 48 h. these results indicate that overexpression of nur <dig> protein in raw <dig>  cells inhibited the endocytic changes typically displayed by mature dcs, and that this inhibition was dependent upon the dna binding and transactivation domains of nur <dig> figure  <dig>

nur <dig> reduced the stimulatory effect of oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells on t cell proliferation
stimulation of allogeneic t cell proliferation is an important function of mature dc. therefore, we evaluated the effect of nur <dig> on t cell proliferation. raw <dig>  cells stably expressing either nur <dig> or the nur <dig> mutant proteins were pretreated with 10 μg/ml oxldl for 48 hrs and then cultured with t cells at a ratio of 1: <dig> for 5 days. to detect t cell proliferation, we monitored brdu incorporation as a measure of cells entering s phase. in the absence of oxldl, there was no t cell proliferation in any of the four stable cell lines. oxldl-treated gfp-expressing control cells effectively induced the proliferation of t cells, as did gfp-nur77-Δtad-expressing and gfp-nur77-Δdbd-expressing cells. in contrast, t cell proliferation in co-cultures with gfp-nur77-expressing cells was approximately one third of the other cell lines . these results are consistent with an inhibitory role for nur <dig> in this t cell assay, possibly through reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules.

nur <dig> reduced cytokine secretion by oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells
finally, we assayed the effect of nur <dig> on cytokine secretion by oxldl-treated raw <dig>  cells. here we show that, il- <dig> and tnf-α from oxldl-treated gfp-nur <dig> cells were decreased to  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively, compared with that from gfp-expressing control cells. in contrast, expression of the nur <dig> mutant proteins did not decrease oxldl-induced il- <dig> and tnf-α secretion. gfp-nur77-Δdbd-expressing cells demonstrated a  <dig> % and  <dig> % increase in il- <dig> and tnf-α secretion, respectively . these data show that nur <dig> had an inhibitory effect on cytokine secretion, which required the nur <dig> dna binding domain and transactivation domains. to test the ability of producing several cytokines by these cells, we also analyzed tnf-α and il- <dig> including a stimulated control with lps in gfp-expressing control cells. results showed that both of the two cytokines can be stimulated by lps and the levels were 3-fold higher than by the stimulation with oxldl  .figure  <dig>

discussion
dendritic cells are the most potent of all antigen-presenting cells, and play a key role in vascular inflammation and immune activation  <cit> . oxldl is a particularly potent inducer of inflammation during the development of atherosclerosis  <cit> . here, we have shown that nur <dig> is likely to play an inhibitory role in dc differentiation. we found that overexpression of nur <dig> in a macrophage cell line, raw <dig> , prevented differentiation into mature dcs following oxldl treatment, whereas sirna-mediated nur <dig> depletion had the opposite effect. consistent with this, constitutive expression of nur <dig> in vivo decreases immune cell development and maturation. together, these data suggest that endogenous nur <dig> may have an inhibitory effect on macrophage activation and immunity. many studies of vascular cells also suggest a protective role for nur <dig> in atherogenesis  <cit> . for example, overexpression of nur <dig> in arterial smooth muscle reduces the formation of smooth muscle-rich lesions  <cit> . in addition, in vitro assays have demonstrated that nur <dig> significantly reduces the inflammatory response and lipid-loading of human macrophages  <cit> .

the possible role of nur <dig> in endothelial cells remains unclear, however. in human vascular endothelial cells, nur <dig> mediates cell cycle arrest through up-regulation of p27kip <dig> and downregulation of cyclin a  <cit> , whereas others have implicated nur <dig> in vascular endothelial growth factor -a-induced angiogenesis  <cit> . thus, the role of nur <dig> in human endothelial cell proliferation is controversial. the reasons for these contradictory effects on endothelial cell proliferation are not clear, but similar effects of nur <dig> are observed in other cells. for example, nur <dig> was originally recognized for its role in cancer cell proliferation  <cit>  but was later found to be a potent pro-apoptotic molecule  <cit> . extensive evidence indicates that the stimulation of proliferation by nur <dig> is a transcriptional effect, based on the observations that the dna binding and transactivation domains were both required  <cit> . we have also found that the transcriptional activity of nur <dig> is required for suppression of macrophage activation  <cit> . thus, we were interested in whether the inhibitory effect of nur <dig> on oxldl-induced macrophage differentiation was also dependent upon its transcriptional activity. consistent with this, expression of gfp-nur77Δtad had no significant effect on the induction of dc differentiation by oxldl compared with expression of gfp alone. in contrast, expression of gfp-nur77-Δdbd caused a modest but significant increase in the proportion of cells with dc morphology and functionality.

the subcellular distribution of the gfp-nur <dig> fusion proteins is consistent with a transcriptional role for nur <dig> because gfp-nur77-Δdbd was mainly cytosolic, whereas gfp-nur <dig> and gfp-nur77-Δtad were nuclear. these observations suggest that nur <dig> protein may induce the differentiation of macrophages into dc when it is localized in the cytosol. although it is not known if oxldl induces the nuclear export of nur <dig> in macrophages, there is evidence from cancer cells that nur <dig> can be induced to translocate from the nucleus to the cytosol and that this confers important biological functions, including apoptosis and differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
the differentiation of macrophages into dc following exposure to oxldl can be suppressed by the transcriptional activity of nur <dig>  the effect of nur <dig> on macrophage differentiation may be related to changes in its subcellular location. nur <dig> might induce macrophage-dc differentiation when it localized in the cytosol. further studies are needed to understand the relationship between the subcellular location of nur <dig> and its protective effect against atherosclerosis.
