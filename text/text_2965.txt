BACKGROUND
a biological species is defined as a group of natural populations that mate and produce offspring with one another, but do not breed with other populations. yet biologists have argued over the details of the definition since around  <dig> <cit> . inter-specific hybridization is a common natural scenario observed both in plants and animals, which roughly occurs in 10% of animal species and 25% of plant species  <cit> . inter-specific mating may lead to introgression  <cit> . introgression can have various consequences  <cit> . at one extreme, introgression may cause merging of the hybridization species; at the other extreme, introgression may lead to selection for conspecific mating, and consequently enlarge the reproductive isolation  <cit> . early studies suggested that hybrids acted as introgression filters, allowing beneficial genes to filter through and preventing introgression of negative genes  <cit> . based on these observations, the beneficial genes would have a higher transmission ratio than the negative genes in the offspring of the hybrids. genetic mapping offers us a powerful tool to display the chromosomal segments that unevenly transmit to the offspring based on marker segregation distortion  <cit> .

p. hwangshanensis and p. massoniana are desirable organisms to study the genetic mechanism triggering speciation. p. hwangshanensis is a native representative conifer that distributes in the subtropical mountainous areas in southeast of china, and it is found at higher elevation than p. massoniana. the ranges of the two species are frequently found to be immediately adjacent to each other, and overlapped with a narrow hybrid zone. the two species are different in morphological, cytological and timber anatomical characteristics, and show clear environmental and spatial separation  <cit> . trees in hybrid zone possess intermediate characteristics. natural hybridization between the two species has been verified by molecular markers  <cit> . the major difference in the ecological niches of the two species is elevation. with an increase in elevation, environmental factors, such as oxygen partial pressure, air temperature and moisture regime, soil temperature and water regime, sunray and ultraviolet light intensity, will change  <cit> . these environmental factors are closely related to plant growth and fitness. they are environmental stresses to cause differentiation in plant phenology and fitness, subsequently, to maintain the species-specific characteristics of the alternate speices. for example, with the change in flowering time, plants will become self-pollinating. besides divergence in phenology, genetic and cytoplasmic incompatibilities are also important introgression barriers. genetic incompatibility between species arises in several ways  <cit> . for instance, pollen and stigma may possess surface proteins that either prevent fusion of the egg and sperm into a zygote, or inhibit pollen tube growth to hamper the fertilization of the plant ovum. alternatively, once a hybrid zygote is formed, it may have low viability or be sterile  <cit> . genetic barriers may also arise through changes in the number of chromosomes in new species  <cit> . p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis are closely related species and they both possess  <dig> haploid chromosomes. however, there might be some other chromosomal changes between the two species, including chromosomal rearrangement, genome expansion, differential gene expression and gene silencing. these changes may lead to selection for fertility and ecological traits that alter the genome structures of the alternate species, in return acting as introgression barriers  <cit> . cytoplasmic incompatibility occurs if the male has an infection that is not present in his mate, resulting in embryonic mortality  <cit> . all above mechanisms drive conspecies mating. both conspecies mating and selection of beneficial/negative genes will consequently cause uneven transmission of genetic materials to the progeny from a hybrid parent both in intercross  and backcross  situations. base on marker segregation distortion and linkage analysis in the progeny of a hybrid, we can track the genomic regions that act as introgression barriers. in this paper, we aim to reveal the potential chromosomal introgression barriers between p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis by building a genetic map using megagametophytes from a single tree sampled in the hybrid zone and to identify regions of the map displaying extreme segregation distortion.

RESULTS
seed germination test
the germination rates of seeds collected from trees along the transaction lines at different elevations of two different locations were listed in table  <dig>  early empirical observations revealed that the elevation range of p. hwangshanensis was generally above  <dig> m, and that of p. massoniana was generally below  <dig> m in the south of the yangzi river in china, the hybrid zone roughly spanned a vertical range from  <dig> to  <dig> m  <cit> . germination tests showed that seed germination rates of trees in the range of hybrid zone were significantly lower than those of trees sampled outside the hybrid zone. although we can not tell whether a tree is a hybrid or not merely based on seed germination rate, the consistent low germination rates for many trees in hybrid zone across different locations can not be interpreted by chance alone. we proposed that low seed germination rates for trees in hybrid zone should relate to the hybrid incompatibility. in table  <dig>  there is one tree at  <dig> m from wuyi mountain that also displays a relatively low germination rate. in that sampling area, pines dominate the landscape above  <dig> m. below this elevation, pines mix with abundant broad-leave trees, which will affect the pine pollination. we propose the drop in this value might be mainly due to environmental factors. in table  <dig>  the tree at  <dig> m in wuyi mountain possesses the lowest seed germination rate in the tested samples. however, we did not obtain enough seeds that generated normal seedlings from this tree for it to be used as the mapping parent. alternatively, we used megagametophytes of seeds from the tree at  <dig> m as our mapping population.

elevation
parameters in this table were determined by  <dig> randomly selected seeds from each tree at the corresponding elevations.

marker analysis and segregation test
twenty-one aflp primer combinations were selected for this study according to li et al.  <cit> . segregating loci were recorded based on presence/absence of the visible alleles. in total,  <dig> segregating loci were collected from these primer combinations, an average of  <dig>  loci per primer pair. since pines possess gigantic genomes  <cit> , more selective oligonucleotides are needed to reduce the amplified loci in aflp genotyping. the numbers of selective oligonucleotides used in this study mainly were e+3/m+ <dig> and e+4/m+ <dig>  there was considerable variation in the number of segregating loci generated by different primer combinations, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  based on the chi-square test,  <dig>  markers were significantly distorted from the expected 1: <dig> segregation ratio at α =  <dig>  significance level . among them,  <dig> skewed to more presence and  <dig> skewed to more absence. the highest chi-square value of ssd markers is  <dig> . since segregation distortion demonstrates the uneven transmission ratio of alleles on the alternate chromosomes in the mapping parent and is related to hybrid incompatibility  <cit> , once these ssd markers are mapped onto linkage groups, the chromosomal regions acting as potential introgression barriers will be revealed.

linkage map construction
linkage analysis with  <dig> megagametophytes from the hybrid pine was performed with all the obtained  <dig> segregating aflp markers. in this paper, all markers that significantly departured from mendelian segregation ratio were included because these markers were hypothesized to reveal sites of hybrid incompatibility. using lod thresholds of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> markers were initially assigned to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> groups respectively, each run left some ungrouped markers. when lod≤  <dig> , there were less linkage groups than the haploid chromosome numbers of pine; at lod =  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> , the same grouping results were derived. therefore lod =  <dig>  was used to assign markers into linkage groups. under this criterion, markers were assigned to  <dig> major linkage groups,  <dig> triplet,  <dig> doublet, and  <dig> unlinked markers. the major linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm in size . we did not achieve complete coverage of the pine genome with this map. by gradually decreasing the lod to  <dig> , no strong linkage was detected between the markers that mapped at linkage group ends. although some loose linkage was observed between markers at the ends of different linkage groups, we did not merge these linkage groups because the loose linkage between markers might have occurred by chance alone. in conclusion, the established map consisted of  <dig> major linkage groups with a total observed genetic length of  <dig>  cm. genetic length derived from this study was very close to that of p. sylvestris  <cit>  and p. taeda  <cit> , both of which were estimated by nearly complete genetic maps. based on the function  given by lange and boehnke  <cit> , if we estimated the genetic length of pine ranging from 1500~ <dig> cm, the estimated coverage of our map would be  <dig> ~ <dig> % of the total pine genome, at  <dig> cm a marker. therefore, our map achieved nearly complete coverage of the pine genome. the unfilled gaps of this map might be due to presence of recombination hotspots or ecori/msei restriction deserts in the corresponding genomic regions. tremendous effort might be needed to fill such gaps with randomly generated markers. the  <dig> major linkage groups consisted of  <dig> markers with an average distance of  <dig>  cm between the adjacent markers. the established map provides a useful platform for demonstrating the potential chromosomal introgression barriers, and for exploring their expansion ranges on different chromosomes.

potential chromosomal introgression barriers
early mapping studies in pine and poplar revealed that the percentage of ssd markers commonly accounted for less than 10% of the segregating markers  <cit> . in this study, percentage of ssd markers was found to be extremely high, accounting for more than 25% of the segregating loci, which implied extensive hybrid incompatibilities between the alternate species. the genomic regions, the expansion range, and the distorted direction of these markers were displayed in figure  <dig>  in this figure,  <dig> ssd markers were mapped onto  <dig> linkage groups, including  <dig> major linkage groups and a triplet. only one ssd marker remained unlinked. furthermore, ssd markers were found to be clustered  on six of the major linkage groups. these ssd marker clusters totally covered  <dig>  cm, accounting for  <dig> % of the total observed genetic length. some of these clusters were found to extend to large regions on the corresponding linkage groups, for example, on linkage group  <dig>  it at least covered a genetic length of  <dig> cm ; on linkage group  <dig>  it extended to a genetic length about  <dig> cm . recombination will relax the segregation distortion of a marker caused by its linkage with deleterious genes. under the observed highest selection intensity, the expansion range of each segregation distortion cluster was estimated by using algorithm  <dig> in the methods. it was noteworthy that the observed expansion ranges were much larger than the estimated expansion ranges on most of the linkage groups . since the expansion range was estimated by having the prior that only one locus caused segregation distortion in each ssd cluster, these inconsistencies implied the expansion ranges of most ssd clusters might be triggered by more than one genetic locus, besides, inter-chromosomal epistatic effect might also play a role in the observed inconsistencies.

parameters of χh <dig>  o, e, and r are described in methods.

discussion
speciation of p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis might be the result of parapatric speciation process. parapatric speciation is one of the evolutionary processes underlying speciation. then grass species anthoxanthum has been known to undergo parapatric speciation as mine contamination of an area, which creates a selection pressure for tolerance to metals  <cit> . the main difference between parapatric speciation and sympatric speciation is that, in the former case, two species occupy separate ecological niches and overlap with a narrow hybrid zone. however, during evolutionary time, p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis might distribute in separate ranges, thus we can not exclude the hypothesis that their speciation could be due to historical geographic barriers. although the speciation process of p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis is debatable, their ranges and their natural gene introgression make them valuable organisms to exploring the genetic mechanism underlying speciation. natural recombinants found in hybrid zones will permit genetic mapping of species differences and reproductive barriers in non-model organisms  <cit> . pines possess gigantic genomes, which are about  <dig> fold that of the human genome and about  <dig> fold that of the poplar genome. although sequence capacity has increased dramatically with the advent of the next generation sequencing technology, whole genome sequencing for organisms with such huge genomes is not feasible in the near future. in contrast to their huge physical length, genetic lengths of pine genomes were found to be modest which ranged approximately from 1500~ <dig> cm  <cit> . thus, it is easy to fast build a genetic map with a good coverage of the pine genome with only a relatively small amount of experimental effort. linkage analysis, combined with marker segregation distortion analysis, will enable us to display the chromosomal segments that unevenly transmit to the offspring from the mapping parent. linkage analysis has been applied in studies of many organisms to help our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying speciation  <cit> .

pine megagametophytes are developed from the megaspore of the maternal tree. in gymnosperms, a diploid precursor cell  undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid cells, then three of those cells degenerate, results in one functional megaspore per ovule. the megaspore then undergoes megagametogenesis to give rise to the megagametophyte and to produce the female gamete. thus, the megagametophyte is haploid tissue and has the same dna as the female gamete that is fertilized by pollen to form embryo in each seed. as a result, marker distortion revealed by megagametophyte genotyping is closely related to selection of alleles on the alternate chromosomes in the maternal parent. since megagametophytes are haploid, in mapping studies, they possess the similar characteristics as recombination inbreeding lines obtained by the single seed descent method that widely used in the establishment of mapping pedigree for crops.

seed germination rates reflect the reproductive ability of trees sampled at different elevations. in order to make seed germination rates comparable, seeds from each tree were randomly selected in the test. we did not cull out the empty seeds or seeds with congenital dysplasia embryos. thus, the low germination rates of trees in hybrid zone could be the result of both pre- and post-zygotic barriers. pre-zygotic barriers mainly include factors associated with pollination and flowering time, and also include factors affecting process of gamete union to form a zygote. once a hybrid zygote is formed, it may have low viability or be sterile, and the underlying factors are known as post-zygotic barriers  <cit> . to resolve the segregation distortion barriers to individual genes will be extremely difficult in pine. first, pines possess gigantic genomes. early linkage analyses indicated that the expectation numbers of crossovers were only about 15~ <dig> per meiosis in pines  <cit> . one centimorgan pine genome contains about 500~ <dig> mb of nucleotides on average. second, genes may have the same or opposite directional effect on segregation distortion. third, besides the underlying genes, segregation distortion can be arisen by epistatic effect, such as linkage disequilibrium  among unlinked markers. finally, segregation distortion observed in hybrids can also be arisen by chromosomal rearrangements in the parental species. therefore, the underlying mechanisms vary greatly for each observed ssd clusters. nevertheless, ssd clusters on a genetic map revealed the genomic regions we should focus on to explore the genetic mechanisms underlying speciation. although the gigantic genome size of pine hampers resolving the underlying genes, its modest genetic length enables us to detect linkage and map qtl easily. to explore the genetic loci underlying segregation distortion, genome-wide associations between hybrid sterility qtl and marker transmission ratio distortion is a desirable approach  <cit> , and candidate gene approach is a good option to help resolve the underlying genes.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we consistently detected low germination rates of seeds collected from trees in the hybrid zone of p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis. we proposed that germination rate reflected the hybrid incompatibility of the alternate species. by using megagametophytes from a single tree in the hybrid zone, we built a nearly complete genetic map for pine genome. based on the ssd markers on this map, we discovered the potential chromosomal introgression barriers between p. massoniana and p. hwangshanensis. this study provided the basis for associating ssd markers with their introgression behavior in natural stands, and established a useful platform for conducting genome-wide associations of hybrid sterility qtl and/or candidate genes with marker transmission ratio distortion in the progeny of a hybrid pine.
