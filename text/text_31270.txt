BACKGROUND
breast tumor initiating cells  are functionally defined by their unlimited renewal potential and ability to reproduce tumor heterogeneity, attracting attention as therapeutic targets  <cit> . there is growing evidence that molecular pathways required for normal stem cell functions are deregulated in bt-ics  <cit> . as occurs with normal organogenesis and cell differentiation, the selective activation and repression of these pathways may be mediated by micrornas . these short non-coding rnas inhibit gene expression by mrna degradation or translational inhibition  <cit> . their importance in establishing developmental programs of expression is illustrated by the requirement of mirna processing proteins like dicer during embryogenesis  <cit> , and the presence of specific mirnas in pluripotent cells  <cit> . since mirnas drive terminal differentiation, downregulation of specific mirnas may play an important role in the development and progression of cancer  <cit> , including breast cancer  <cit> . therefore, the aberrant expression of specific mirnas could lead to a pathologic expansion of immature cells. to gain insight into this untested hypothesis, we performed a mirna profiling in putative bt-ics enriched from breast cancer cell lines. our studies revealed a family of mirnas that play a key role in defining features of these cells. we further identified and validated the targets of this family of mirnas and studied its role in survival of bt-ics in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
microrna profiling in putative bt-ics
because of their role in defining expression programs in development and cancer, we investigated whether mirna expression displayed a particular profile in putative bt-ics. the non-adherent mammosphere culture system, in which stem-like cells are capable of forming suspended spheres, has been extensively used to enrich cultures for bt-ics  <cit> . we used the mammosphere system to compare mcf <dig> bt-ics with their parental cell line in a mirna oligonucleotide array covering  <dig> human mirnas. in addition, we plated mcf7-derived mammospheres back to attachment conditions to induce their reconfiguration into an epithelial monolayer . independent biological replicates dis-played high consistency , while unsupervised clustering discriminated mammospheres from parental mcf <dig> cells . in contrast, parental mcf <dig> cells and “differentiated” mammospheres displayed a similar mirna profile and clustered together after unsupervised analyses, suggesting that mammospheres retained the ability to revert their mirna expression profile to the original conditions . class comparison analyses showed that  <dig> human mirnas were differentially expressed between mammospheres and parental mcf <dig> cells , including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir-26a, and five members of the mir- <dig> family . all these mirnas were strikingly downregulated in mammospheres , while their expression increased close to basal levels after plating the mammospheres back to attachment conditions . when performing a class comparison analysis among the  <dig> groups , mir-30a-5p displayed the most consistent capacity to distinguish mammospheres from the other two groups .

mean expression values and fold-change  are shown for mcf <dig> cells and mcf7-derived mammospheres . p-value <  <dig> , fdr <  <dig> .

no mirnas were significantly overexpressed in mam-mospheres, and therefore we focused our attention in those mirnas significantly downregulated. results were validated using an independent expression array platform, together with specific taqman qrt-pcr assays. results obtained with the illumina human v <dig> bead array, were consistent with the oligonucleotide array data, showing no significantly overexpressed mirnas in mammospheres . mir-30a was the most significantly down regulated mirna in mammospheres compared to parental mcf <dig> cells, while mir-26a and mir- <dig> were also found to be significantly downregulated . the differential expression of several mirnas including mir-30a and mir-26a were further confirmed using taqman probes . absolute copy number quantification was performed by using a standard mir30a probe at different dilutions . extrapolating to these standards, we defined an average of approximately  <dig> copies of mir-30a per mcf <dig> cell. this is significantly higher than the  <dig> copy per cell obtained in mammospheres . in addition, a significant down-regulation of mir-30a expression was found in mammospheres derived from the non-related mammary cancer cell line, 4t <dig>  relative to parental 4t <dig> cells . these results have revealed a panel of differentially expressed mirnas, and demonstrated that mir- <dig> family downregulation is not cell line specific, and may indeed play an important role in mammosphere formation and maintenance of cell growth under non-attachment conditions.

mir-30a regulates non-attachment growth in putative bt-ics
among differentially expressed mirnas in mam-mospheres, mir30a-5p  displayed the most consistent  and significant downregulation . therefore, we chose to address the functional role of this mirna in putative bt-ics. we experimentally modulated mir-30a levels and studied the capacity to form mammospheres in vitro, as an extensively used assay to estimate the capacity of self-renewal and proliferation  <cit> . to this end, mcf <dig> breast cancer cells were transfected with either mir-30a inhibitor  oligos , or pre-mir-30a precursor oligos  during 48 hours, and studied cellular response to downregulation and overexpression of mir30a. as a control, cells were also transfected with mir- <dig> inhibitor  oligos, a mirna known to lack targets in the human genome  <cit>  . we found a dramatic reduction in the number of mammospheres formed after over-expression of mir-30a in mcf <dig> cells  . in contrast, mir-30a kd transfection significantly enhanced the formation of mammospheres in mcf <dig> cells . inhibition or overexpression of mir-30a did not affect mammospheres morphology or size .

to further test the generality of the impact of mir-30a regulation in mammosphere formation, we transfected an independent breast cancer cell line  with mir-30a kd and pre-mir-30a precursor oligos and examined its ability to grow in non-attachment conditions. in general, 4t <dig> cells displayed an enhanced ability to produced mammospheres compared to mcf <dig> cells, consistent with the higher invasiveness and metastatic potential of these cells. importantly, also in 4t <dig> cells, transfection with pre-mir-30a resulted in a striking reduction in 4t1-derived mammosphere formation  , consistent with the results obtained in mcf <dig> cells. however, in contrast to mcf <dig> cells, we observed a slight  reduction in the number of mammospheres after downregulation of mir-30a  . of note, transfections did not have any effect in cell growth and viability of parental 4t <dig> and mcf <dig> cells. together, these results revealed a functional role of mir-30a in sustaining the growth of breast cancer cells in non-attachment conditions and suggest that mir-30a may regulate essential pathways for the self-renewal of putative bt-ics.

identification of mir-30a target genes in putative bt-ics
mirnas are able to regulate their target genes by decreasing their mrna levels  <cit> . therefore, we screened for mir-30a targets using whole genome expression bead arrays after transfecting mcf <dig> cells with mir-30a-kd probe and mir-30a precursor, as well as mir-159-kd  oligos . this assay produced high quality data with strong correlation between biological replicates . although unsupervised clustering was able to clearly distinguish mcf <dig> cells overexpressing mir-30a, samples from cells inhibited for mir-30a clustered together with control samples . consistent with this finding, although  <dig> genes were differentially expressed between pre-mir-30a-transfected and control cells, our analysis showed no differentially expressed genes between the mir- <dig> kd and control cells . as mir- <dig> kd oligos had a significant effect on sphere formation , this result indicates that biologically significant targets may fall below the sensitivity of the assay or the thresholds used for the analyses . among  <dig> differentially expressed genes in pre-mir-30a transfected cells, there were  <dig> genes downregulated, suggesting that these may be direct targets of mir-30a . the mirna seed sequence serves to direct the mirna to its mrna targets  <cit> . therefore, to identify the genes that are likely to be bona fide targets of mir-30a, we took advantage of publicly available algorithms to identify the genes with 3′utr region containing mir-30a seed sequences . our analysis identified  <dig> potential targets, some of which  have been previously reported  <cit> . for validation, we chose a subset of differentially expressed genes . in all cases, qrt-pcr confirmed the bead array results using independent biological replicates . importantly, this validation confirmed the downregulation of potential mir-30a targets after mir-30a overexpression, whereas no difference in gene expression between mir-30a-kd and mir-159-kd control transfected cells was found , consistent with the bead array transcriptome data.

significantly downregulated genes after pre-mir-30a transfection. only potential targets with 3′utr seed sequences of mir-30a are included. “scores” are based on the pita algorithm, as described in materials and methods. targets common to mir- <dig> family wge analysis are underlined.

among the significantly downregulated genes, we selected foxd <dig> and aven for further validation using luciferase assays. aven was amongst the most significantly downregulated genes after mir-30a over-expression, while foxd <dig> was a predicted mir-30a target by  <dig> different algorithms . we cloned the 3′utr sequences of foxd <dig> and aven, containing the seed sequence of mir-30a, in pgl <dig> control vector expressing constitutively the luciferase gene. a construct containing the 3′utr sequence lacking the complete mir-30a seed sequence was used as a control. these constructs were transfected into mcf <dig> cells, which express low, but detectable, levels of endogenous mir-30a . a significant reduction in luciferase expression was observed after transfection with both 3′utr constructs, compared to pgl <dig> control . moreover, a further reduction in luciferase activity was observed after overexpressing mir-30a in co-transfected cells . these results suggest that mir-30a is specifically targeting the 3′utr regions of foxd <dig> and aven. together, these findings support the differentially expressed genes as direct targets of mir-30a and thus they may play a major role in mammosphere growth. however, a potential compensatory effect by other members of the mir- <dig> family may explain the lack of effect after efficient downregulation of mir-30a.

mir- <dig> family displays gene target redundancy in breast cancer cells
although the large majority of mirna targets remain unknown, there is evidence for redundant target specificity of unrelated mirnas, or mirnas from the same family  <cit> . our data on mir-30a knocked-down cells suggested a compensatory effect by other member of the mir- <dig> family. therefore, to test for target redundancy within the mir- <dig> family, we used a custom-designed probe-set to simultaneously inhibit all  <dig> members of the family: mir-30a, b, c, d and e. a significant downregulation of all mir <dig> micrornas was observed after transfection with family inhibitor probe-set, confirming the global effect of the family inhibitor . moreover, downregulation of the mir- <dig> family correlated with overexpression of one of the new potential target genes, aven, an effect not observed when only mir-30a was inhibited . next, we performed a new transcriptome analysis on mcf <dig> cells transfected with mir- <dig> family kd probes, mir- <dig> precursor or mir- <dig> kd . in contrast to the first whole genome expression analysis, a three class comparison revealed this time  <dig> differentially expressed genes distinguishing the three classes . we next looked for those genes simultaneously upregulated after kd and downregulated after precursor transfection, as they were most likely to be direct targets . we found  <dig> genes that overlapped between these two conditions. out of these,  <dig> genes were found to have a 3′utr region containing mir-30a seeds. importantly, this analysis revealed that among the genes whose expression is most strongly influenced by mir- <dig> family kd were idh <dig>  aven and foxd <dig>  all of which had been identified in the previous transcriptome analysis . indeed, out of  <dig> targets of mir30a identified in the first screening,  <dig>  were also identified after silencing mir <dig> family in the second screening. moreover, this last screening included  <dig> experimentally validated targets of mir- <dig>  <cit> , such as p4ha <dig> and cbfb, that had not been revealed by the previous whole genome expression analysis. these results suggest that mir- <dig> family members display target redundancy, and the downregulation of all of its members is necessary for growth under non-attachment conditions.

to define functional enrichment of mir <dig> targets, we used the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig> . first, we used the final list of  <dig> putative targets of mir <dig> family of mirnas. however, no significant enrichment was found for any functional category or pathway when using the whole human transcriptome as a reference. next, we performed enrichment analyses in the extended  <dig> genes list, that represents all transcripts significantly regulated  after mir <dig> family modulation, independently of the presence of a putative seed sequences in their 3′utr. we analyzed their enrichment in specific gene ontology  categories, and biological pathways . only those categories with p value <  <dig>  for three different statistical tests , were considered as statistically significant. top significant go category was cytokinesis, while both go and biocarta pathway analyses were significant for a number of metabolic processes  . interestingly, kegg pathway analysis produced two significant categories: polyadenylation of mrna, and egf signaling pathway. polyadenylation is known to be involved in mrna stability, while egf signalling has been shown to promote cancer cell proliferation and to enhance mammosphere formation  <cit> .

mir- <dig> overexpression impairs breast cancer tumor formation
to explore the in vivo role of mir-30a, we induced tumors by injecting 4t <dig> cells in the mammary fat pads of immunocompetent balb/c mice. we chose 4t <dig> cells because its patterns of tumor growth at the primary site of injection and the metastatic spread in balb/c mice closely mimic human breast cancer  <cit> . prior to s.c. injection, 4t <dig> cells were transiently transfected with mir-30a-kd, pre-mir-30a or control mir-159-kd oligos. after 3 weeks, tumors induced with mir-30a overexpressing 4t <dig> cells  were significantly smaller and lighter than control and mir-30a kd tumors . tumours collected after 3 weeks were dissociated and plated under mammosphere conditions to quantify their sphere formation potential. interestingly, cells derived from both, mir-30a-kd and pre-mir-30a, displayed a lower ability to form spheroids in vitro. although this difference was not significant for mir-30a-kd, it was borderline significant for pre-mir-30a  . to further explore the potential role of other members of mir- <dig> family, this experiment was replicated using simultaneous inhibition of the mir- <dig> family , as described above. similar to the previous experiment, only mir-30a overexpression was able to induce significantly smaller tumors under these conditions . no significant differences were observed after mir- <dig> family kd. in addition, a trend for a reduced number of ex-vivo spheroids was again observed with pre-mir-30a . importantly, several studies have suggested a metastatic behavior for putative bt-ics. therefore, we next studied the induction of lung metastasis under modulation of mir- <dig>  a non-significant reduction in the number of metastatic colonies was observed after mir-30a overexpression . interestingly, while the number of mammospheres did not correlate significantly with tumor weight or volume, it significantly correlated with the number of colonies . therefore, a higher ability to produce spheres ex vivo correlated with a higher number of lung colonies in the clonogenic assay. this suggests a link between the ability to grow in non-attachment conditions and the metastatic behavior in vivo. together, these in vivo experiments support an important role for mir- <dig> in regulating the mammary cancer cells responsible for tumor growth.

aven overexpression can rescue mammosphere growth in presence of mir30a
the biological role of mirnas is the result of simultaneously targeting multiple transcripts  <cit> . in this sense, we expect that mir <dig> role in non-attachment growth is probably the result of multiple target regulation. however, we were interested in investigating in more detail the role of aven, because of the link between increased expression of this protein and cell survival  <cit> , and poor prognosis in different types of human malignancies  <cit> . moreover, the role of aven has been specifically addressed in breast cancer cells, including mcf <dig> cells  <cit> . we used endoribonuclease-prepared sirna pools  targeting aven coding sequence to transiently silence aven expression in mcf <dig> cells. two days after sirna we tested the effect of aven silencing on a sphere formation assay, as described above. importantly, we found that silencing significantly impaired sphere formation when compared to a non-targeting control sirna  . in addition, we used plasmid overexpression to further understand the role of aven in sphere formation. to this end, we used an expression plasmid encoding for full length aven. we selected a plasmid concentration that increased aven expression without affecting cell survival. western blots performed 48 hours after transfection of mcf <dig> cells showed a higher aven expression relative to cells transfected with empty-vector . under non-attachment conditions, we found that increased expression of aven produced a significant increase in sphere formation, compared to empty pcdna <dig>  vector . these results suggest that aven likely has a specific role in survival under non-attachment conditions in breast cancer cells. in addition, we assessed the ability of aven to rescue the negative effect of pre-mir30a transfection  in the sphere formation assay. importantly, we observed lower expression of aven when overexpressing mir30a  in both conditions, empty vector and full length aven transfected cells. this is probably the result of mir30a targeting the endogenous aven, which is expressed at detectable levels under basal conditions . next, we validated the effect of mir30a overexpression in the presence of an empty pcdna <dig>  vector under non-attachment conditions . mir30a overexpression drastically impairs the ability to form spheres. as described above, we observed a significant increase in the number of spheres after transfection with full length aven plasmid. interestingly, full length aven was able to significantly increase sphere formation in the presence of mir30a overexpression to levels close to control empty-vector levels .

the negative effect of aven silencing in sphere formation suggests an independent role of this protein in survival under non-attachment conditions. moreover, the ability of aven to rescue mir30a effect suggests that the role of mir30a expression in non-attachment growth can be partially mediated through targeting of the transcript for this anti-apoptotic protein.

discussion
due to their ability to simultaneously target multiple transcripts, mirnas are able to participate in most cellular processes. in the same way, their deregulation has been frequently observed in complex human diseases, including cancer. in this report we studied the potential role of mirnas in sustaining the subpopulation of breast cancer cells with the highest tumor-initiating ability. we identified mir- <dig> as a family of mirnas strongly regulated under non-attachment conditions of cell growth, a standard method for selecting bt-ics. by modulating the expression of mir- <dig> family we were able to regulate the growth in non-attachment conditions, as shown by sphere formation assays performed in vitro, and ex vivo. in addition, upregulation of mir- <dig> family expression impaired tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. we were able to further identify potential common targets of mir- <dig> family with a role in survival and proliferation. these findings explain why a common downregulation of multiple members of the same mirna family may be necessary for sustaining the growth in non-attachment conditions.

an important consideration is the absolute copy number of mirnas necessary to target a specific mrna. this has been recently addressed using high throughput assays   <cit> . interestingly, only a fraction of detected mirnas  displayed suppressive activity, and this activity correlated with a mirna expression above  <dig> reads per million, or  <dig> copies per cell. our absolute quantification of mir30a shows approximately  <dig> copies per mcf <dig> cell. although this is significantly higher than the number of copies observed in mammospheres, the absolute copy number lies below those reported as biologically relevant  <cit> . this borderline number of copies may explain a relatively “mild” effect of mir30a knockdown. however, based on our own data, many mir30a targets were common targets to other members of the mir <dig> family. therefore, the cumulative concentration of mir <dig> family may reach a level beyond biological suppressive activity. however, we were not able to see an increased effect on mammosphere formation after silencing the whole mir <dig> family . other considerations include the ratio between mirna and target mrna abundance, and the longer half life of mirnas compared to mrnas.

we performed the first comprehensive analyses of mir- <dig> family targets. importantly, two recent studies combined proteomics and microarrays to reveal that changes in protein expression mediated by a mirna are usually associated with altered mrna expression, suggesting that mrna degradation may be the major component of mammalian mirna repression  <cit> . these recent findings give strong support to our strategy for target identification by using mrna screening.

the importance of different mir- <dig> family members has been highlighted in several contexts. mir-30e was shown to regulate self-renewal and inhibit apoptosis in bt-ics  <cit> . overexpression of mir-30e in these cells inhibits their self-renewal capacity by reducing ubc <dig>  and induces apoptosis through silencing itgb <dig>  although ubc <dig> and itgb <dig> were not included in our final list of mir-30a targets, we studied in more detail other targets also potentially involved in apoptosis and proliferation. foxd <dig>  has a role in tumor formation  <cit> , while aven  has an established role in apoptosis regulation  <cit> . although aven is unlikely to be the only mir-30a target involved in non-attachment growth, our results suggest an important role in this process that should be followed in further studies. for example, it would be interesting to understand the mechanisms by which aven rescues cell death, and whether they differ from the truncated deltan-aven form  <cit> . in addition, because of the transient transfections used in our experiments, our results may be an underestimation of the role of mir <dig> and aven, and studies on stable/inducible systems may provide more drastic effects. in line with our findings, ectopic expression of mir- <dig> in bt-ics xenografts reduced tumorigenesis and lung metastasis in non obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice, whereas blocking mir-30e expression enhanced tumorigenesis and metastasis  <cit> . in this sense, mir- <dig> downregulation may correlate with an in vitro expansion of putative bt-ics. in addition, recent studies suggested a role of mir- <dig> family in epithelial-mesenchymal transition  <cit>  and replicative senescence  <cit> , processes closely linked to stem cell biology and tumor suppression, respectively.

a potential link between mir- <dig> expression and clinical parameters has also been shown. mir- <dig> was recently found to be part of a metastatic signature in a series of breast, bladder, colon and lung cancers  <cit> . indeed mir-30c expression has been suggested as a predictor of endocrine therapy in er+ breast cancer  <cit> . interestingly, it was shown that mir- <dig> family members are all down-regulated in both estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–negative tumors, suggesting that expression of these mirnas is regulated by these hormones  <cit> . indeed, two members of the mir <dig> family have been recently shown to be downregulated by progestins  <cit> . in addition, mir-30a-5p, as well as mir-26a and mir-26b, were shown to be downregulated in tumors with high proliferation index  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study indicates that putative bt-ics enriched in a mammosphere assay have a distinct mirna profile, essential for their proliferation balance. in vitro, this distinct profile is necessary to acquire the capacity to grow in non-attachment conditions. in vivo, this profile may be involved in a higher ability to induce tumors. we highlight the specific role of mir- <dig> family in these two contexts, and performed the first comprehensive analyses of mir- <dig> family targets.
