BACKGROUND
the mammalian y chromosome is constitutively haploid, restricted to males, and subject to ongoing genetic deterioration due to lack of recombinational exchange with a homologous partner. set against this, however, there is strong evolutionary drive to preserve the function of male-benefit genes on the y chromosome, and to acquire novel male-benefit genes on the y  <cit> . these opposing effects lead to a heterogeneous structure of y chromosomal dna, with functional genes  set among a sea of degenerate pseudogenes, repetitive sequence, and parasitic transposable elements.

the long arm of the mouse y chromosome is a spectacular example of this process, being highly repetitive, transcriptionally silent in the majority of cell types, and yet indispensable for normal spermatogenesis  <cit> . deletions on mouse yq lead to teratozoospermia and reduced fertility. the severity of the phenotypes varies according to the extent of the deletion, with large deletions  resulting in complete infertility  <cit> , while smaller deletions  result in reduced fertility and a less severe sperm shape abnormality  <cit> . intriguingly, the offspring of males with 2/ <dig> yq deletions show an approximately 60: <dig> sex ratio skew in favour of females  <cit> , and this is due to reduced efficiency of y-bearing sperm  <cit> .

recently, we have made considerable progress in defining the gene content of mouse yq, identifying two new repeat gene families  <cit>  in addition to the one family previously known . during this work, we observed novel "recombinant" transcripts arising from loci that contain exons from both ssty <dig> and asty, and termed this new transcript asty  <cit> . here, we describe the detailed genomic arrangement of this rearranged locus and show expression of a large variety of transcriptional variants arising from these rearranged loci. these variant transcripts are differentially regulated during testis development.

we were also interested to know how these rearranged loci arose, and whether there were further examples of such "exon shuffling" on mouse yq. we therefore compared the genomic organisation of the loci encoding all known yq genes to each other and to their x-linked homologues, in order to more clearly delineate the composition of the novel rearranged loci, the differences between each of the yq genes and their x-linked relatives, and the sequence of events involved in the genesis and amplification of these genes.

finally, we investigated the wider genomic context of the rearranged loci by in silico mapping of the location of all known msyq genes within the currently-released draft y chromosome sequence contigs. the msyq gene copies located by the mapping project were used to construct phylogenetic trees elucidating the sequence of events in msyq evolution

RESULTS
a rearranged locus formed by chimerism between three yq-specific genes
while we previously reported the presence of both ssty <dig> and asty exons within the locus encoding asty  <cit> , further analysis of public genome sequence data shows this locus to be entirely composed of regions with high sequence similarity  to members of all three known yq-linked gene families. the structure of this novel locus is shown in figure 1a. it comprises sequence homologous to exons  <dig>   <dig> and partial exon  <dig> of ssty <dig>  followed by exons 2– <dig> of asty, followed by exons 1– <dig>  of sly in the opposite orientation. since the locus contains segments of all three yq-linked gene families, we feel the designation asty is no longer appropriate. given its highly unusual composition, and the fact that it is transcribed in both directions, we propose the name orly .

as previously detailed  <cit> , a search of the nr database revealed two full-length cdnas arising from orly, both originating from the relict ssty <dig> promoter. in this article we will refer to these transcripts as orly_v <dig>  and orly_v <dig> ). the splicing patterns of orly_v <dig> and orly_v <dig> are shown in figure 1b.

orly generates a wide diversity of alternative splice variants
the existence of the orly_v <dig> and orly_v <dig> transcripts indicates differential splicing of the central exons in orly. we performed a screen using primers from the various exons present in orly_v <dig>  in order to see what further orly splice variants were expressed. all primer pairs that gave an rt-pcr product from adult testis were tested using a range of normal mouse testis rnas from different ages post partum in order to resolve the developmental onset of expression for each splice variant form . primer pairs s <dig> f2/n <dig> r <dig> and n <dig> f/n <dig> r <dig> were also tested against a range of tissues to check tissue specificity of expression, and proved to be testis specific .

when using primer pairs directed at the outermost exons , a single major band corresponding to orly_v <dig> is observed, suggesting that this is the most abundant orly transcript. two faint larger bands were also detected by the s <dig> f2/n <dig> r <dig> primer pair , however, we were unable to obtain sequence for these products. these upper bands are likely to represent transcripts including portions of ssty <dig> exons 2/ <dig> or asty exons 2– <dig>  as detected in the other reactions . no larger bands were seen in the s <dig> f1/n <dig> r <dig> reaction. it is possible that the larger bands detected by the s <dig> f2/n <dig> r <dig> primer pair arises from copies of the orly locus where the exon s <dig> f <dig> and/or n <dig> r <dig> primer binding sites are mutated.

using primer pairs directed at the other orly_v <dig> exons gave a wide variety of bands. many of the products generated from rt-pcr on adult testis were gel purified and sequenced to confirm which regions of orly are included in each detected transcript. unfortunately we were unable to generate clean sequence for the products produced by the s3a.f/a <dig> r primer pair. this is likely due to the presence of a large number of similarly-sized transcripts which cannot be separated on a gel. the resulting partial transcriptional map for orly is shown in figure 1d. in most cases, the sequenced bands correspond to spliced transcripts, however, the majority of the products do not conform to the splicing pattern of orly_v <dig> or orly_v <dig>  it appears that there is a plethora of different orly isoforms expressed at low levels, which are only detected when specific primers are used.

we investigated whether any of the detected orly isoforms had any significant coding potential. the ssty <dig> open reading frame is encoded by exon  <dig> of ssty <dig>  which is not fully included in any orly transcriptional variant . orly transcripts thus do not encode the ssty <dig> protein. the sly portion of the locus is in antisense, thus orly transcripts cannot encode any portion of sly. finally, asty does not contain any open reading frame, thus the asty-related portion of orly also has no coding potential. further electronic searching of the various orly transcriptional variants revealed no significant open reading frames other than a partial degenerate retroviral pol sequence .

orly retains potential promoter sequence from both ssty <dig> and sly
the regions of high sequence identity between orly and its various progenitor loci extend a further  <dig> kb into the upstream region of ssty, and  <dig> kb into the upstream region of sly, indicating that the rearranged locus has retained the proximal upstream promoter regions of both genes, in antisense orientation relative to each other . orly_v <dig> and orly_v <dig> are known to be transcribed from the relict ssty <dig> promoter  <cit> , which is thus shown to be functional.

turning to the relict sly promoter region, we conducted a search for transcription factor binding sites using tfsearch  <cit> . this showed that of the  <dig> predicted transcription factor binding located between - <dig> and + <dig> of the reference sly sequence,  <dig> were present at the corresponding site in orly, indicating retention of potentially functional promoter elements . overall sequence identity between sly and orly across this region is  <dig> %. significantly, the conserved elements include a gccaat box at position - <dig> of the reference sly locus. this motif is a strong transcriptional signal, and is known to be present in other spermatid specific tata-less promoters such as the pgk- <dig> promoter  <cit> .

both of the promoters at opposite ends of orly are functional
this electronic promoter analysis suggested to us that the relict sly promoter at the 3' end of the orly locus may have retained functionality, and be able to generate opposite-strand transcripts. we designate such opposite-strand transcripts as orlyos. no orlyos transcripts were present in the nr or dbest databases. we used strand-specific rt-pcr to determine whether any of the bands shown in figure  <dig> corresponded to orlyos transcripts.

importantly, of the three bands obtained using the n <dig> f/n <dig> r <dig> primer pair, the lower band corresponds to a forward orientation  transcript, while the upper band corresponds to a reverse orientation transcript . sequencing confirmed that this rt-pcr product shows 99% identity to the reference orly genomic sequence over  <dig> nt, and only 91% identity to sly over  <dig> nt. this demonstrates that this transcript arises from an orly locus rather than from sly, and constitutes a true orlyos transcript. the middle band seen in this reaction is not always detected by rt-pcr, and we were unable to determine the direction of transcription of this band.

of the other splice variants shown in figure  <dig>  all were confirmed by strand-specific rt-pcr to be "forward"  transcripts . this is unsurprising as the primers were designed against the forward transcript orly_v <dig>  orlyos transcripts must necessarily have different exon boundaries, which presumably do not include the majority of the primer locations included in our screen.

the terminal exons of orly derive from a retrovirus and are in antisense to sly and orlyos
both of the known orly transcripts terminate with two novel exons with antisense homology to intron  <dig> of sly . as discussed above, this section of orly is also transcribed in the opposite orientation, generating orlyos transcripts. thus there is the potential for orly transcripts to form dsrna either by pairing with orlyos transcripts or with nascent sly transcripts.

exons n <dig> and n <dig> derive from a partial degenerate retrovirus belonging to the murvy lineage of mouse y chromosome specific repeats  <cit> , which is embedded in this intron of sly . orly-f transcripts terminate at the transcription stop site of this murvy-related element. we therefore deduce that although the murvy element is degenerate and does not encode a functional retrovirus, its transcriptional termination site has remained functional and become co-opted to form the transcriptional termination site for orly forward transcripts. none of the known orly transcripts contain any large open reading frames, however, orly_v <dig> contains a short orf running from bases 117– <dig>  this orf has 63% identity and 75% similarity over 49aa to a partial pol gene , further demonstrating the retroviral origin of the terminal exons of orly.

tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of orly isoforms
orly transcripts are under tight transcriptional control. all variant forms  are only observed after day  <dig> of postnatal life, and thus are deduced to be spermatid-specific. this is to be expected as both ssty <dig> and sly promoters are spermatid specific  <cit> . the age of first appearance for each band varied from day  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating differential regulation of orly isoforms in successive spermatid stages. this variation was observed both between different primer pairs , and between different bands detected by the same primer pair . this differential regulation may be due to spermatid stage dependent splicing of transcripts, or may represent varying subsets of transcripts arising from different copies of orly with subtly different promoter activities. it is unfortunately not possible to use in situ or northern blot data to confirm the detailed cellular expression patterns of these transcripts, since there is no portion of any of them which is not also part of a different y-linked gene or retrovirus with a confounding expression pattern.

genomic comparisons of orly, its progenitor loci, and their x homologues
we carried out a detailed comparison of the genomic loci encoding orly, the other msyq genes and their x counterparts, in order to better delineate the sequence of events during msyq evolution.

genomic comparison of ssty <dig> and ssty2
the structure of the reference genomic loci encoding ssty1/ <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> . sequence identity is  <dig> % across the locus as a whole. the coding region is conserved , and lies entirely within exon  <dig>  sequence identity within the coding region is  <dig> %. the splice site at the end of the first exon is conserved. ssty <dig> does not incorporate sequence corresponding to exon  <dig> of ssty <dig>  the splice site at the start of the terminal exon is located differently in ssty <dig> and ssty <dig>  the latter thus having a longer terminal exon which in part matches intronic sequence from ssty <dig>  the 5'utrs of the two gene transcripts are thus very different despite the high sequence identity between the loci. an x-linked member of this gene family  is known, however, the similarity at the nucleotide level is low except for a small segment at the start of the coding region  .

genomic comparison of xmr and xlr
the structure of the reference genomic loci for xmr and xlr is shown in figure  <dig>  xmr has two transcriptional variants arising from alternative transcription start sites, as indicated in this figure. the structure of xlr is similar to the shorter transcriptional variant of xmr, however, there is considerable sequence divergence in exon  <dig> of xlr. in particular, the 3' portion of xlr exon  <dig> does not match any xmr sequence. the longer transcript derived from the xmr locus contains  <dig> additional 5' exons which do not show sequence similarity to the upstream region of the xlr locus. these exons thus represent either novel sequence acquired by xmr following xmr/xlr divergence, or deletion of the 5' portion of the xlr locus.

there are two partial degenerate line elements within the xmr locus, the first lying in the second intron of the longer isoform, and the second lying in the sixth intron . in addition to these degenerate lines, xmr also contains a full-length line element from the l1md-a <dig> lineage, which includes upstream monomer repeats and thus is potentially transcriptionally active  <cit> . the element lies in intron  <dig> of xmr but is not found in the corresponding location  of xlr, indicating that the line insertion occurred subsequent to xmr/xlr divergence.

sly arose as a chimeric gene via fusion of xmr and xlr
sly, the yq-linked member of the family, is a chimeric gene formed by fusion of the 5' portion of xmr to the 3' portion of xlr. figure  <dig> shows the structure of sly together with the homologous regions of xmr and xlr.

the origin of the 5' end of sly is demonstrated by exons 1– <dig>  which match the  <dig> additional exons uniquely present in the longer xmr isoform. the origin of the 3' end of sly is demonstrated by exons 7– <dig>  which match the final exons of xlr including the xlr-specific portion of exon  <dig>  sly lacks the l1md-a <dig> element present in xmr intron  <dig>  further confirming the chimeric nature of this gene as an xmr/xlr hybrid. exons 5– <dig> of sly arose via duplication of exons 3– <dig> and show 88/ <dig> nucleotide identity to these exons. there are degenerate line elements at the borders of this duplication event, and also at the border between the xmr-derived and xlr-derived segments of sly, thus it is likely that recombination between line elements was responsible for the creation of sly.

the line element present in intron  <dig> of sly is interrupted by a stretch of dna with distant sequence similarity to the mouse msyq-specific retrovirus, murvy. this line element is uninterrupted in the progenitor xmr, thus we conclude that the murvy insertion occurred subsequent to the creation of sly. the murvy-related sequence is inserted in antisense orientation relative to sly itself. the extent of the murvy-related stretch of dna varies between sly copies , but in all cases the terminal portion  is retained. repeatmasker analysis  <cit>  of the insert shows  <dig> % divergence,  <dig> % deletion and  <dig> % insertion relative to the consensus murvy ltr sequence, and  <dig> % divergence for non-ltr portions of the insert. as discussed above, the murvy-related sequence in sly intron  <dig> forms the source for the terminal orly exons.

recent work has shown that both xmr and sly are cytoplasmic proteins, in contrast to xlr, which is nuclear <cit> . the krkr nuclear localisation signal in xlr, which is conserved from the autosomal progenitor gene scp <dig>  is located in exon  <dig>  this signal is mutated to krkw in the corresponding portion of sly, while xmr does not include this exon at all. thus while xlr retains the ancestral nuclear pattern of protein localisation, both xmr and sly have become cytoplasmic via different mechanisms.

genomic comparison of asty/astx
as reported previously  <cit> , asty and astx have an identical genomic organisation, and share ~95% sequence identity across introns and exons.

the genomic context of orly
we used blast comparison to search for all copies of each yq-linked gene  in the currently-released draft sequence contigs .

we then used this information to generate a "fingerprint" for each available yq contig, noting the order and orientation of the various copies of each gene present in each contig . interestingly, we found that orly always has the same genomic context, being flanked downstream by ssty <dig> and upstream by ssty <dig>  with both loci in the same orientation as orly. the neighbouring copies of ssty <dig> all contain a sine insertion at position  <dig>  and form a distinct sub-group within the phylogenetic tree .

using the fingerprints as a guide, we were able to assemble a "super-contig" containing  <dig> copies of ssty <dig>   <dig> copies of ssty <dig>  two copies of asty, two copies of sly and one copy of orly. in all,  <dig> of the  <dig> yq contigs are congruent with this super-contig ordering, and a further  <dig> contigs appear to be slight variants upon it. this "super-contig" indicates the presence on mouse yq of a highly amplified repeat unit of greater than  <dig> kb in length, which presumably corresponds to the huge repeat array reported at conferences by alfoldi et al  <cit> . sequence identity between the various contigs contributing to this "super-contig" is very high , indicating substantial homogeneity between copies of the huge repeat.

however, many contigs did not fit the huge repeat consensus ordering. two further classes of yq contig were identified : ssty/asty-enriched contigs  and sly /asty-enriched contigs , while  <dig> contigs remained unclassifiable. these non huge repeat contigs were also highly internally repetitive. figure  <dig> is an example dotter plot comparing  to itself. the structure is of a tandem repeat unit of ~ <dig> kb embedded inside a larger tandem repeat of ~ <dig> kb. in all, the repeated segment in nt_ <dig> shows  <dig> % identity over  <dig> nt.

contig classes are defined by contig content in terms of the known yq-linked genes. the huge repeat consensus ordering of gene loci is shown in figure  <dig> 

dynamics of yq gene family expansion
a key question is whether these four gene families  were amplified separately on yq during mouse evolution, or whether there was a single period of amplification increasing the copy number of all genes simultaneously.

we constructed a set of phylogenetic trees using the neighbour-joining method of saitou & nei  <cit> , comparing ssty1-, asty- and sly-derived regions of orly to the corresponding regions of the progenitor loci . for the asty- and sly-related trees, we were able to use the x-linked homologue as an outgroup to root the tree, however, for the ssty-related tree this is not possible owing to much greater divergence of the x homologue which precludes accurate alignment. for this tree, the ssty <dig> clade was used as the outgroup to root the tree. bootstrap analysis of  <dig> replicates was used to establish the robustness of all three trees.

from this phylogenetic analysis we observe:

• in all three cases, orly sequences form a discrete clade .

• gene copies lying within the huge repeat contigs also form distinct clades in all three trees . note that each copy of the huge repeat unit contains several copies of ssty <dig>  ssty <dig> and asty. these three genes thus give rise to several huge repeat-associated clades in each tree. each of these clades contains the gene copies from matching locations within the huge repeat unit.

• a final set of contigs forms a distinct clade in both the ssty and asty-related trees. this clade contains a group of ssty <dig> /asty-enriched contigs, , genbank:nt_ <dig>  genbank:nt_161911] . at slightly lower confidence levels, this clade also includes  .

• at the time of orly divergence, the ssty family was already moderately amplified on the y, with ~ <dig> ssty <dig> lineages and ~ <dig> ssty <dig> lineages present. by contrast, at the time of orly divergence, there were only ~ <dig> asty lineages and  <dig> sly lineage present on the y

• in all three cases, there was a massive amplification of gene copy number subsequent to orly divergence. this amplification occurred predominantly in branches of the phylogenetic tree corresponding to huge repeat contigs, however, there was also amplification of a ssty <dig> /asty-enriched clade subsequent to divergence of the orly clade.

from these trees, we also observed that all genes within each family showed very similar degrees of divergence from the root of the tree in all cases. this is to be expected as all three trees were based on noncoding sequence. the sequence used to build the trees is thus likely to be evolving at nearly neutral rates. given nearly neutral rates of evolution, the degree of sequence divergence forms a "molecular clock" indicating the timing of the various events on mouse yq. we therefore also generated trees using the upgma algorithm, which explicitly assumes a molecular clock .

in this analysis, the percentage divergence of orly from its progenitor loci  is  <dig> % for orly/ssty <dig>   <dig> % for orly/asty and  <dig> % for orly/sly. the percentage divergence between the orly branches of the tree  is  <dig> % for the ssty1-derived region,  <dig> % for the asty-derived region and  <dig> % for the sly-derived region. while the absolute rate of the clock cannot be determined from these data, the numbers obtained from the three trees are in good agreement with each other, strengthening our inferences of the timing of events on yq.

conclusions of the phylogenetic study
taken together, these results of the phylogenetic tree analysis and locus fingerprinting of yq contigs indicate that events on yq occurred in the following sequence.

1) sstx/ssty divergence 

2)ssty1/ssty <dig> divergence

3) generation of sly by chimerism between xmr and xlr

4) moderate amplification of ssty <dig>  ssty <dig> and asty

5) generation of orly by chimerism between ssty <dig>  asty and sly

6) massive amplification of two familes of large-scale repeat on yq. the first repeat family contains representatives of all yq genes including orly and constitutes the huge repeat array, while the second specifically contains ssty <dig> and asty.

at present unresolved is the question of when the murvy retrovirus arrived on yq. the presence of murvy-related sequence within intron  <dig> of every copy of sly indicates that sly acquired its murvy-derived insert in intron  <dig> some time between stages  and , however, the origin of murvy itself cannot be placed in the above sequence from available evidence.

discussion
we report here on the genomic locus orly and the wide variety of alternatively spliced transcripts arising from it. orly has a complex and unusual genomic structure, being derived from partial copies of three other yq-linked genes. intriguingly, we also found sly to be derived by combination of existing genes, in this case a fusion of the 5' region of xmr with the 3' region of xlr, together with an internal duplication of exons 3– <dig> of the xmr-derived segment. this may indicate that chimerism and "exon shuffling" are a general feature of novel y chromosome gene creation. significantly, the two outermost partial gene loci contributing to orly are in antisense orientation relative to each other, and retain their upstream promoter regions. we detected orlyos transcripts in addition to orly transcripts, and thus deduce that both promoters have retained their activity. in particular, exons n <dig>  n <dig> and the intervening intron are transcribed in both directions. this region derives from a murvy retroviral insertion into intron  <dig> of sly.

there is an intriguing parallel to be drawn with the stellate system in drosophila melanogaster, where there is a sense/antisense regulatory loop between x-encoded stellate and y-encoded su repeat genes  <cit> . in the case of stellate, the y gene arose from the x gene by insertion of a transposon  in reverse orientation  <cit> . antisense su transcripts primed from the transposon promoter act to regulate both sense su and stellate transcript levels via an rnai mechanism  <cit> . similarly, orly and orlyos transcripts could potentially regulate each other and also sly. a key avenue of future work is to determine the full length sequence of orlyos, in particular whether it contains any ssty1- or asty-derived regions which may in turn regulate these genes.

the comparison to stellate is especially interesting given the sex ratio skewing in male mice bearing partial yq deletions. partial deletions of the repressor su on drosophila y chromosome lead to sex ratio skewing or infertility dependent upon the x chromosomal stellate haplotype present  <cit> . stellate was hypothesised to be a meiotic drive gene  <cit> , although this is now disputed  <cit> . in male mice, partial deletions of yq lead to mild teratozoospermia and sex ratio skewing  <cit> , with reduced effectiveness of y-bearing sperm  <cit> . larger deletions lead to severe teratozoospermia and infertility  <cit> . the mice with partial deletions show normal fertility and fecundity , thus the only effect of the decrease in yq gene copy number appears to be the sex ratio skew.

it should be understood that the sex ratio skew in mouse with yq deletions does not constitute meiotic drive in the classical sense, since equal numbers of x- and y-bearing gametes are generated at meiosis  <cit> . nevertheless, the presence of yq-encoded genes affecting sex ratio indicates the potential for a conflict between these yq-encoded genes and other interacting x- or autosomally-encoded factors. given that yq deletion also leads to a spermatid-specific derepression of x transcripts  <cit> , with increasing x gene expression correlated with the extent of the deletion, we have suggested that there may indeed be an ongoing genomic conflict between the mouse x and y chromosomes, with x-linked sex ratio distorter genes acting to favour generation of female offspring, and yq-linked repressor genes acting to restore a normal 50: <dig> sex ratio. such an intragenomic conflict is expected to lead to massive amplification of gene number on both chromosomes due to an "arms race" between the conflicting genes  <cit> . intriguingly, the hybrid sterility seen in mus musculus musculus/mus musculus molossinus consomic strains is x-dependent  <cit> .

whether genomic conflict is involved or not, the fact that yq-encoded genes are necessary for normal levels of y chromosome transmission necessarily leads to a strong and direct evolutionary pressure to maintain the function of these genes. this may be one of the factors behind the recent and highly unusual gene amplification seen on mouse yq. orly, being composed of portions of all the other known msyq-linked genes, must also necessarily be the most recent known addition to msyq gene content.

CONCLUSIONS
orly is a novel chimeric locus on mouse chromosome yq which is bidirectionally transcribed, giving rise to orly and orlyos transcripts. these transcripts may potentially form dsrna in partnership with each other, or with the progenitor loci ssty <dig> asty and sly. a phylogenetic tree analysis of yq genes indicates that orly arose shortly prior to a massive expansion in copy number of all the yq-linked genes. also, potentially significantly, copies of orly are only found in the context of the huge repeat array that distinguishes msyq – a particular segment of around  <dig> kb that appears to have been amplified en bloc. taking the above evidence together, we propose that the emergence of orly may have been one of the triggers that led to massive amplification of yq sequence. further analysis of the genomic complement of msyq, and the copy number of the corresponding x genes, in a range of different mouse subspecies should help date these events more precisely, and establish whether x-y genomic competition is a contributing factor to the gene amplifications.
