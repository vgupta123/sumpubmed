BACKGROUND
the transforming growth factor β  superfamily comprises a large number of secreted peptide growth factors that have major regulatory effects on cell growth and differentiation  <cit> . members of this superfamily include the tgfβs, the prototypes of the superfamily; the bone morphogenetic proteins ; and other members such as activin, inhibin, and nodal. tgfβ superfamily ligands bind to a heteromeric receptor complex at the cell surface. this complex contains two related transmembrane serine/threonine kinases, the type i and type ii receptors  <cit> . signaling downstream of the receptors is mediated by the smad proteins, which shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus to regulate target gene expression  <cit> . type i receptors directly activate receptor-regulated smads  by phosphorylation at c-terminal sxs sequences  <cit> . phosphorylation of r-smads promotes heterotrimeric complex formation with co-smads and accumulation in the nucleus to regulate gene transcription  <cit> . in mammals, five r-smads are present: two  that transduce tgfβ/activin/nodal signals and three  that transduce bmp signals. strikingly, the tgfβ family ligands far outnumber the smads available for signal transduction. furthermore, many of these ligands are capable of eliciting diverse context-dependent responses. thus, smad complexes must be capable of mediating multiple diverse outcomes. it is thought that smad complexes rely in part on transcription cofactors for appropriate regulation of target genes.

in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans, the bmp-related factor dbl- <dig> regulates body size and male tail morphogenesis via a conserved receptor/smad signaling pathway  <cit> . using a genetic approach to uncover components of this pathway, we previously identified sma- <dig>  a gene that is required for the body size and male tail patterning functions of dbl- <dig>  <cit> . sma- <dig> is also required for patterning of the mesodermal lineage, in which it acts antagonistically to the dbl- <dig> pathway  <cit> . sma- <dig> is predicted to encode multiple protein products homologous to drosophila schnurri, a large zinc finger transcription cofactor that functions in dpp/bmp signaling  <cit> . analysis of sma- <dig> therefore provides the opportunity to elucidate the requirements for transcription cofactor function in an in vivo model system during the course of development. in addition to drosophila schnurri and c. elegans sma-9/schnurri, three vertebrate schnurri homologs have been identified. these bind the κb-binding site and function in t cell development  <cit> . notably, vertebrate schnurri homologs have more recently been demonstrated to mediate transcriptional regulation downstream of bmp and tgfβ ligands, indicating a conserved role for these family members in tgfβ signal transduction  <cit> .

the sma- <dig> open reading frame  predicted from genomic sequence encodes a protein of  <dig> aa consisting of an n-terminal gln-rich domain  and a c-terminal domain containing seven zn fingers . the sequencing of cdna clones, however, revealed at least eight different mrna species with alternative protein coding regions  <cit> . interestingly, like sma- <dig>  human shn- <dig> and shn- <dig> genes undergo alternative splicing  <cit> , but the functional consequences of this processing have not been addressed. the sma- <dig> cdna clones were classified based on their potential to code for the seven c-terminal zn fingers: class i encodes all seven zn fingers , class ii encodes the first pair and the triplet of zn fingers , and class iii encodes only the first pair . to determine whether these domains have different functions in vivo, foehr et al. created genomic/cdna hybrid constructs and tested their ability to rescue the body size and mesodermal patterning defects of sma- <dig> mutants  <cit> . they found that constructs encoding class i and class ii c-termini were capable of rescuing both phenotypes, while the class iii construct was not, suggesting that the presence of the zn finger triplet is critical for function in body size and mesodermal lineage regulation.

since sma- <dig> is a large gene, most of the existing cdna clones contain incomplete coding sequences that are missing the 5' end of the gene. two cdna clones, yk1285a <dig> and yk1237d <dig>  however, are notably different . although these two cdna clones are less than half the length of the predicted transcript, both of them have all of the hallmarks of a full-length cdna: trans-spliced leader sequence, poly tail, and a complete orf. in c. elegans, many transcripts are processed at the 5' end by trans-splicing, which results in the addition of a 22-nucleotide splice leader sequence, sl <dig> or sl <dig>  <cit> . the mechanism of trans-splicing is similar to that of cis-splicing , except that the splice donor sequences are provided by the sl <dig> and sl <dig> genes, rather than being contained within the context of the individual gene  <cit> . about half of all c. elegans genes are subjected to sl <dig> trans-splicing at the 5' end. a smaller subset of c. elegans genes are transcribed in polycistronic operons. in an operon, the 5'-most gene generally receives the sl <dig> splice leader. the individual downstream genes in an operon are then separated via sl <dig> trans-splicing to the 5' ends of each of the downstream genes. sl <dig> trans-splicing is accompanied by polyadenylation to create the 3' end of the neighboring gene upstream. yk1285a <dig> contains the sl <dig> splice leader and sequences from predicted exons 1- <dig>  yk1237d <dig> contains the sl <dig> splice leader and sequences from predicted exons 11- <dig>  as previously noted  <cit> , the putative intercistronic region contains features reminiscent of the identified signals for trans-splicing, including a u-rich sequence, but is atypically long  <cit> . thus, the structures of the sma- <dig> cdna clones yk1285a <dig> and yk1237d <dig> suggest that they may represent two transcripts processed from a single longer transcript by sl <dig> trans-splicing and polyadenylation as normally occurs in a c. elegans polycistronic operon.

since each of these trans-spliced short sma- <dig> transcripts was only represented by a single cdna clone, we could not be certain that the clones were not due to cloning artifacts or a rare spurious event. furthermore, our previous analysis did not address whether these short transcripts provide any function required for dbl- <dig> signal transduction. we therefore address here several remaining questions about these predicted transcripts. first, can we verify that the mrna variants represented by yk1285a <dig> and yk1237d <dig> are expressed in vivo, rather than being artifacts produced during cdna library construction? if so, then how is the expression of these variants regulated? finally, do these variants show functional differences between each other and/or relative to full-length transcripts in vivo? in this work, we will refer to the splice variants represented by clones yk1285a <dig>  and yk1237d <dig>  as a <dig> and d <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
isolation of cdnas spanning upstream and downstream regions
the sma- <dig> orf predicted from genomic sequence is encoded by  <dig> exons . previously characterized cdna clones, however, contained only a subset of these  <dig> exons and, in particular, none of the existing cdna clones spanned a region including both the n-terminal gln-rich domain and the c-terminal zn finger domains. we therefore used primers in exons  <dig> and  <dig> with the potential to generate nearly full-length cdna inserts by rt-pcr. after rt-pcr, the clones with the longest inserts were selected for sequencing. the most complete cdna clone isolated by this approach was pcs <dig>  in which exons 4- <dig> and part of exon  <dig> are spliced out . this transcript form is reminiscent of a form identified by the orfeome project, in which exon  <dig> becomes spliced to exon  <dig>  <cit> . these results thus support the existence of sma- <dig> transcripts capable of encoding both the gln-rich and the zn finger domains. additional support derives from rt-pcr data using exon  <dig> primers .

expression of sma- <dig> variant transcripts
we next sought to obtain evidence that the short transcripts represented by cdna clones yk1285a <dig> and yk1237d <dig>  are expressed in vivo, rather than cdna artifacts. to address this question, we needed an approach to distinguish these short transcripts from full-length transcripts containing the same internal sequences. unfortunately, we were unable to detect sma- <dig> mrnas by northern blot . instead, we used the unique termini of the short transcripts to design variant-specific primer pairs for rt-pcr. for a <dig> we employed an oligo-dt-containing reverse primer anchored by two nucleotides from sma- <dig> exon  <dig> with a gene-specific internal forward primer; for d <dig> we used an sl2-containing primer anchored by two nucleotides from sma- <dig> exon  <dig> with a gene-specific internal reverse primer. to determine empirically whether these primer pairs are specific for a <dig> and d <dig>  we performed rt-pcr using a gradient of annealing temperatures  and analyzed the products . in both cases, the primer pairs amplified a single band of the correct size , indicating that the primers specifically detect the desired transcripts. since the higher annealing temperatures resulted in reduced yield, we used 50°c for all subsequent analyses. based on these results, we conclude that transcripts polyadenylated downstream of exon  <dig> and transcripts containing the sl <dig> splice leader sequence upstream of exon  <dig> are represented in the pool of sma- <dig> mrnas in vivo.

the initial rt-pcr experiments were performed non-quantitatively on mixed-stage rna preparations. we subsequently used real-time quantitative rt-pcr  to determine the relative expression levels of sma- <dig> variant transcripts and whether they are developmentally or sex-specifically regulated. since we expect full-length transcripts, but not the short transcripts, to contain sequences from exon  <dig>  we used exon  <dig> internal primers to determine the expression levels of potentially full-length transcripts and calculated the abundance of the short transcripts relative to exon-9-containing transcripts. three developmental time points were assayed:  <dig> hr ,  <dig> hr , and  <dig> hr . we find that exon-9-containing transcript levels increase during larval development and are highest in adulthood . d <dig> transcripts accumulate in wild-type strain n <dig> at 45% - 85% of the level of exon-9-containing transcripts at all developmental time points examined, while a <dig> transcripts accumulate at approximately 10% of the level of exon-9-containing transcripts . if a <dig> and d <dig> are produced concurrently by trans-splicing of full-length transcripts, then the reduced accumulation of a <dig> may be due to differential stability of the transcripts. one possible mechanism for reduced stability of the a <dig> transcript is the unusual location of the termination codon taa, in which the terminal adenines are introduced during polyadenylation and are contiguous with the poly tail. to test for sex-specific expression of these transcripts, him- <dig>  mutant populations that contain both hermaphrodites and males were compared to wild-type n <dig> hermaphrodite populations. in him- <dig> populations, the full-length and the d <dig> transcripts, but not a <dig>  accumulate to a 2-4-fold higher level than in hermaphrodite populations, suggesting that these transcripts are expressed at a higher level in males. the short transcripts are not male-specific, however, since they are also expressed in hermaphrodites. thus, the a <dig> and d <dig> cdna clones represent detectable mrnas that are expressed during larval and adult stages when dbl- <dig> is active in regulating body size and male tail patterning.

mean expression levels are give as percent of the expression level of exon-9-containing control, plus or minus standard deviation.

loss of function of sma- <dig> variant transcripts
previous work has shown that sma- <dig> constructs lacking the zn finger triplet  are unable to rescue the body size and mesodermal patterning defects of a sma- <dig> mutant  <cit> . these experiments did not test, however, for differential requirements of short vs. full-length transcripts. to test whether sma- <dig> variant transcripts have specific functional roles, we performed rnai targeting three different regions of the sma- <dig> gene. in previous experiments, dsrna was introduced by microinjection  <cit> , but we have found that rnai by feeding results in a higher penetrance of male tail defects. we have therefore repeated these experiments using the feeding technique  <cit> , and extended them by targeting the internal exon  <dig> in addition to the 5' and 3' ends of the gene. the effectiveness of each rnai treatment was monitored by the appearance of the characteristic small body size phenotype .

as a component in the dbl- <dig> pathway, sma- <dig> mutant phenotypes include small body size and male abnormal phenotypes  <cit> . one aspect of the male abnormal phenotype in sma- <dig> is the fusion of male tail sensory rays  <dig> and  <dig>  two of the nine bilaterally symmetrical pairs of male-specific sensory organs. in wild-type animals, ray 8- <dig> fusions are also observed, but at a lower frequency. treatment of wild-type animals with rnai targeting exons 1- <dig> caused no increase in the frequency of ray 8- <dig> fusions , although the small body size phenotype was produced. this treatment is predicted to knockdown expression of full-length and a <dig> variants but not the d <dig> variant. conversely, rnai targeting exons 21- <dig>  predicted to knockdown the d <dig> and full-length variants, resulted in a two-fold increase in the frequency of ray 8- <dig> fusions . these results are consistent with our previous findings that rnai of the 3' end of the gene results in more severe male abnormal phenotypes than inactivation of the 5' end  <cit> . we next compared the male tail phenotype produced by rnai targeting the central exon  <dig>  predicted to inhibit full-length transcripts but not the short transcripts. this treatment resulted in a male tail defect of lower penetrance than that produced by rnai targeting the 3' end . since the most severe male tail defect occurred when d <dig> was targeted, these experiments suggest that d <dig> has a role in regulating sensory ray patterning. full-length sma- <dig> products are also predicted to function in sensory ray patterning, since the inhibition of a central exon resulted in a partial male abnormal phenotype.

1all male tail phenotypes are scored with him- <dig> in the background to increase the frequency of males.

nd: not determined.

we sought to repeat this analysis using genetic mutants, since the rnai treatments might cause some nonspecific effects due to targeting of unspliced pre-mrna or to rnai spreading  <cit> . we took advantage of three sma- <dig> alleles containing premature termination codons at different locations in the gene : qc <dig> in predicted exon  <dig> , wk <dig> in predicted exon  <dig> , and cc <dig> in predicted exon  <dig> . therefore, in qc <dig>  only the d <dig> transcript is capable of encoding a functional gene product; in wk <dig>  both a <dig> and d <dig>  but not the full-length transcript, are capable of encoding functional gene products; and in cc <dig>  only the a <dig> transcript is capable of encoding a functional gene product. since additional disruptions may occur due to nonsense-mediated decay  <cit> , we determined the transcript expression profile for these strains at the l <dig> stage . in all three mutant backgrounds, the transcript levels are somewhat reduced compared to the him- <dig> control. the reduction in transcript levels is most striking in the sma- <dig> background . this severe reduction in transcript levels is consistent with our observations that this allele causes the most severe body size phenotype . most importantly for the interpretation of our experiments, sma- <dig> and sma- <dig> animals express the short transcripts at detectable levels near the normal range .

the usual expectation for a series of nonsense mutations is that the earliest premature termination codon will have the most severe mutant phenotype while later termination codons may cause less severe defects if those alleles encode partially functional gene products. for the sma- <dig> alleles, the opposite result is seen in the male tail. the allele encoding the latest termination codon, cc <dig>  causes the most severe male tail defect, with a frequency of ray 8- <dig> fusions greater than any of the previously characterized alleles . since different investigators typically vary in their quantitation of ray fusion frequencies, we also repeated measurement of the male tail defects of qc <dig> and wk <dig> for direct comparison. consistent with previous results, qc <dig>  the allele containing the earliest termination codon, causes a mild male tail defect, while wk <dig>  containing a termination codon in exon  <dig>  results in an intermediate frequency of ray fusions . thus, the severity of the sensory ray defect is inversely correlated with predicted d <dig> activity. the most severe defect is manifested in cc <dig> mutants, in which the d <dig> isoform is disrupted by mutation. an intermediate frequency of ray fusions occurs in wk <dig> mutants, in which the d <dig> transcript is expressed at reduced levels but is not disrupted by mutation. a mild male tail defect is seen in qc <dig> mutants, in which levels of d <dig> transcripts are lower than in wild type but higher than in wk <dig> . overall, with regard to male tail patterning, these mutations form an allelic series in which their levels of activity are the opposite of that expected.

in body size, a different result was obtained with these three mutants . the sma- <dig> mutant shows the smallest body size. in contrast, both qc <dig> and cc <dig> produce less severe body length phenotypes that are mutually indistinguishable . since qc <dig> and cc <dig> produce indistinguishable body size defects, this analysis does not support a specific role for either the a <dig> or the d <dig> transcript in the regulation of body size. furthermore, the more severe body size phenotype of wk <dig> mutants could be due to the lower overall level of sma- <dig> expression in these mutants . the results of body size analysis thus suggest that full-length isoforms, rather than a <dig> or d <dig>  are critical for promoting growth. based on our rnai data and on the differential effects of the three nonsense alleles on body size and male tail development, we hypothesize that the d <dig> short transcript has a tissue-specific function in sensory ray development.

rescue of sma- <dig> mutant phenotypes by overexpression of d <dig> cdna
consistent with our hypothesis, we have previously demonstrated that overexpression of the d <dig> cdna, but not of a <dig>  from a heat shock promoter can partially rescue sma- <dig> mutant male tail defects  <cit> . in comparison, expression of sma- <dig> from a cosmid genomic clone containing the entire coding region resulted in nearly complete rescue of the ray fusion defect  <cit> . we next asked whether expression of sma- <dig> short transcripts is sufficient to provide normal gene function in qc <dig> and in cc <dig> mutants, in which the a <dig> and the d <dig> transcript, respectively, are disrupted by premature termination codons. as before, transgenics carrying hs-sma- <dig> constructs were subjected to heat shock during the l <dig> stage when sensory ray identities are being established  <cit>  and males were scored in adulthood. in cc <dig> mutants, which contain a premature termination codon within the d <dig> transcript, expression of d <dig> resulted in partial rescue of the male tail defect . in contrast, overexpression of a <dig> in cc <dig> caused a slight reduction in frequency of sensory ray fusions, but this effect was not statistically significant . in qc <dig> mutants, in which the a <dig> transcript contains a premature termination codon, we were surprised to find that overexpression of a <dig> produced no change in male tail phenotype, whereas overexpression of d <dig> resulted in significant rescue of the male tail defect . based on the rescue of male tail defects by d <dig> in both qc <dig> and cc <dig> mutants, we conclude that increased expression of d <dig> may be able to compensate partially for defective full-length sma- <dig> transcripts.

finally, we looked for evidence of a <dig> or d <dig> function in body size regulation. the body size phenotypes of qc <dig> and cc <dig> did not support a specific role for either a <dig> or d <dig> in body size regulation, since these two mutants have indistinguishable sizes . to determine whether increased expression of a <dig> and/or d <dig> can promote growth, we used our heat shock constructs to drive their expression. heat shock of transgenics in the l <dig> stage produced no evident changes in body size , so we performed heat shock earlier in development, in l <dig> animals, and measured body length in adulthood. in contrast to the rescue of male abnormal phenotypes by d <dig>  heat shock of a <dig> and d <dig> transgenics led either to a reduction in body size or to no change in body size . these results suggest that a <dig> and d <dig> do not contribute to the growth promoting activity of sma- <dig>  if anything, increased expression of a <dig> and d <dig> may interfere with the ability of gene products from full-length transcripts to promote increases in body size.

discussion
we have shown here that the c. elegans sma-9/schnurri locus undergoes a novel trans-splicing process to generate two shorter transcripts, one of which has a tissue-specific function in dbl-1/bmp signaling. first, we have demonstrated that an sl <dig> trans-spliced, truncated cdna form, yk1237d <dig> , represents an actual mrna that is detectable by rt-pcr. second, we have verified that longer transcripts containing both the 5' and 3' ends of the gene are also detectable by rt-pcr. third, loss-of-function experiments  demonstrate that the short transcript d <dig> is necessary but not sufficient for male tail patterning, since depletion of both d <dig> and full-length transcripts causes a more severe male tail patterning defect than depletion of full-length transcripts alone. fourth, gain-of-function experiments  indicate that the short transcript d <dig> can partially rescue male tail but not body size defects of sma- <dig> mutants. in contrast to the results on d <dig>  we find for the yk1285a <dig>  transcript little or no evidence of an in vivo function, as well as low abundance throughout development. in addition, class i and ii full-length transcripts and the d <dig> short transcript, but not the a <dig> transcript, encode the zn finger triplet domain shown to be critical in the regulation of body size and mesodermal patterning  <cit> . in drosophila, this domain is also critical in mediating dpp-responsive target gene regulation  <cit> . the gene product encoded by the a <dig> transcript lacks this domain and may therefore not be capable of being recruited to target genes. why then is the a <dig> transcript detected at all? one possibility is that it is generated as a byproduct of the trans-splicing mechanism that generates d <dig> 

since we have shown that full-length transcripts and d <dig> transcripts are each necessary but not sufficient for male tail patterning, we must consider what differences in molecular function are found in the respective gene products. in other organisms, schnurri homologs have been shown to act either as transcriptional activators  <cit>  or as transcriptional repressors  <cit>  mediating bmp-dependent transcription. strikingly, yao et al.  <cit>  have shown by swapping drosophila and xenopus schnurri homologs that transcriptional activation or repression activities may be context-dependent rather than an intrinsic property of the protein. in c. elegans, we have previously analyzed intrinsic transcriptional activities of sma- <dig> protein domains using a heterologous transcription assay  <cit> . in these experiments, the acidic residue-rich domain  in exon  <dig> exhibited transcriptional activator activity, while the n-terminal region of sma- <dig> displayed intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity  <cit> . full-length sma- <dig> transcripts should encode protein products containing both of these transcriptional domains, so that their transcriptional activities may be context-dependent as was described for drosophila and xenopus schnurri  <cit> . on the other hand, d <dig> transcripts encode products containing solely the transcriptional activation domain . we therefore hypothesize that full-length sma- <dig> isoforms function as transcriptional repressors or activators depending on context, while d01-encoded isoforms may be obligate transcriptional activators. this transcriptional activation activity may be necessary for the robust activation of sma- <dig> target genes in sensory ray development, but may be dispensable in body size regulation. consistent with this hypothesis, a sma- <dig> zn finger domain fusion with a known transcriptional activator, vp <dig>  can partially rescue the male tail defects but not the body size defects of sma- <dig> mutants. in contrast to the sma-9::vp <dig> fusion, a sma-9::enr repression domain fusion rescues body size, suggesting that transcriptional repression is more important than activation for sma- <dig> activity in body size regulation  <cit> . overall, the in vivo activity of the sma-9::vp <dig> fusion is strikingly similar to that of the d <dig> isoform.

alternative splicing is regulated by trans-acting factors that influence the choice of splice sites. it will be of interest to determine the trans-acting factors that regulate alternative trans-splicing of sma- <dig>  in preliminary experiments, we tested whether sma- <dig> trans-splicing depends on mec- <dig>  which encodes an rna recognition motif-containing protein that regulates alternative splicing in the hypodermis  <cit> . we found that a <dig>  d <dig>  and exon 9-containing transcript levels were all reduced 2- to 5-fold in mec- <dig> mutants relative to n <dig> . if mec- <dig> were directly involved in processing the short transcripts from a longer precursor, we expected to find reciprocal changes in accumulation of the full-length transcripts relative to short transcripts. our results are therefore not sufficiently clear to draw a conclusion as to whether mec- <dig> is directly involved in sma- <dig> trans-splicing, and additional investigations will be necessary to identify the trans-acting factors that mediate this reaction.

a variety of genetic mechanisms exist for generating diverse functions from a single genetic locus, including those that affect transcript structure such as alternative splicing, alternative transcriptional start sites, and alternative polyadenylation. one prominent example of alternative splicing is the regulation of sex determination in drosophila by sex-lethal  <cit> . this system also uses developmentally regulated alternative promoters. in c. elegans, extensive use of alternative promoters leading to different protein isoforms has been documented  <cit> . alternative polyadenylation can also lead to the production of truncated protein variants, such as in the daf- <dig> bmp receptor gene in c. elegans, in which alternative polyadenylation leads to the production of a secreted negative inhibitor of daf- <dig> signaling  <cit> . to our knowledge, alternative trans-splicing as we have characterized it for sma- <dig> has not previously been reported for other loci in c. elegans. the unique feature of this trans-splicing event is the choice between processing the transcript via cis- or trans-splicing at the splice acceptor site of predicted exon  <dig>  in an organism without trans-splicing, a similar truncation could be achieved via use of a downstream transcriptional start site or via proteolytic cleavage. for example, in the hedgehog signaling pathway, full-length transcription factors of the ci/gli family are transcriptional activators that, upon proteolytic cleavage, are converted to transcriptional repressors  <cit> . we speculate that since the trans-splicing machinery exists in c. elegans, it was available to be recruited for this unusual role in the sma- <dig> locus.

CONCLUSIONS
both c. elegans sma-9/schnurri  <cit>  and the human homologs shn- <dig> and shn- <dig>  <cit>  display alternative splicing that is predicted to result in multiple protein isoforms. for most of these isoforms, however, no specific in vivo function has been described. we have now demonstrated a functional role for an alternatively trans-spliced sma- <dig> short transcript represented by cdna clone yk1237d <dig> . this transcript mediates a tissue-specific role, since it is required for sensory ray development but not for body size regulation. our results provide insight into how a single genetic locus can contribute to diverse protein functions.
