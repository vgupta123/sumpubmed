BACKGROUND
micrornas  are 21– <dig> nucleotide double-stranded rna molecules produced from endogenous genes by the sequential action of the rnase iii enzymes drosha and dicer. at the present time,  <dig> mirnas have been identified in mammalian tissues   <cit>  and shown to regulate the post-transcriptional expression of multiple genes through a mechanism similar to rna interference   <cit> . indeed, bioinformatics studies suggest that up to a third of all known genes maybe regulated by this mechanism  <cit> . post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is mediated by the rna-induced silencing complex , which uses one strand of the mirna molecule  to target relevant mrnas at their 3'-untranslated regions. once mrna is targeted by mirnas, the risc is thought to inhibit protein production either through blocking translation or by reducing mrna stability  <cit> .

at the present time, the functions of only a fraction of the identified mirnas are known. however, it appears that mirnas play an essential role during development, since studies with dicer knockout mice have shown that these die prematurely and have a variety of developmental abnormalities  <cit> . furthermore, tissue specific developmental functions of individual mirnas have been determined in mice and zebrafish. for example, mir- <dig> expression affected limb development  <cit> , mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> cardiogenesis  <cit>  and skeletal muscle development  <cit> , and mir- <dig> enhanced myoblast differentiation  <cit> . aberrant mirna expression has also been implicated in the induction of cancer, particularly within the lung and haematopoietic system. thus, a number of studies have demonstrated that the development and prognosis of lung cancer is associated with selective changes in the profile of mirna expression  <cit> .

at the present time, nothing is known of the role of mirnas during aging in mammals, although the aging process has previously been shown to be associated with changes in the transcription of several protein coding genes  <cit> . in contrast, studies in the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans have shown that alterations in the expression of mirnas are associated with aging. for example, over-expression of lin- <dig> led to extended lifespan, while loss of lin- <dig> resulted in a reduced lifespan  <cit> . in addition, another study reports an overall age-related decline in mirna expression  <cit> . however, it is currently unclear how these findings translate to aging in vertebrate organisms in the context of both senescence and disease.

in previous studies in mouse and human lung, we used a highly sensitive and semi-quantitative rt-pcr array to demonstrate profound changes in the profile of mirna expression during development  <cit> . in the present study, we have adopted the same approach to detect changes in lung mirna expression during aging using inbred balb/c mice. however, despite the characteristic changes in anatomical structure and decreased expression of the pro-collagen genes we observed no significant alteration in the expression of  <dig> individual mirna species. these data imply that the transcription of mirnas is not influenced by the aging process, which contrasts to the decreased expression in a range of non-mirna encoding genes.

RESULTS
we have previously shown that the mirna expression profile differs significantly between the fetal and adult lung  <cit> . in order to determine if similar alterations in mirna expression occur during aging, we compared adult  with aged  mouse lung. structural changes were evident in accordance with aged lung tissue and included enlargement of alveolar spaces associated with a decrease in total surface area . the spatial distribution of collagen was unaltered in the aged lung compared to adult lung, and was most prominent around bronchioles and vasculature . such structural changes are not necessarily associated with specific diseases per se, but are rather more indicative of senescent tissue  <cit> . thus, alveolar enlargement and a decrease in surface area are associated with decreased oxygen transfer and arterial oxygen saturation, resulting in the characteristic age related reduction in lung function.

alterations in collagen and elastin deposition in aged lung tissue have previously been implicated in reduced lung compliance and senescence  <cit> . therefore the expression of three genes involved in the biosynthesis of collagen were analysed by rt-pcr. the expression of col1a <dig>  col3a <dig> and col6a <dig> all significantly decreased in aged lungs compared to adult lungs . this demonstrated that differences in the expression of conventional protein encoding genes were indicative of a senescent state in  <dig> month old mouse lung tissue. the role that collagen plays in the aging process and its importance for lung function has sometimes been uncertain. however, our data supports previous studies that show that collagen synthesis is reduced in the aged lung  <cit> . the decreased expression of col1a <dig>  col3a <dig> and col6a <dig> with age is consistent with the general reduction in the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis  <cit> .

in order to evaluate whether mirnas play a significant role in the aging process, a highly sensitive, semi-quantitative rt-pcr method was employed to analyse the expression of  <dig> individual mirnas. the relative expression is presented as the Δct value for each age group , therefore the smaller the Δct value the higher the expression of the mirna. the expression analysis revealed a number of mirnas that previously have not been demonstrated to be highly expressed in the lung, including mir- <dig> . foregoing research indicated that mir- <dig> may be involved in the specific differentiation of erythrocytes  <cit> , although such high expression in lung tissue suggests that alternative cell types, such as pulmonary epithelial cells, require mir- <dig> for their maintenance and/or development. mir- <dig> is genomically located at mouse chromosome  <dig> b <dig> and the syntenic region at human chromosome 17q <dig> , and is expressed in both species from an intergenic region upstream of mir- <dig> .

in agreement with our previous study  <cit> , mir-26a was the most highly expressed of all the mirnas profiled in the lung, irrespective of age. the continuing high expression of mir-26a demonstrates that its transcription is unaffected by aging. such highly expressed mirnas are likely to play key roles in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, which is vital for the preservation of normal lung function. it is likely that disregulation of such mirnas would perturb such homeostasis and may even initiate pathogenesis. indeed, irregularities in normal mirna expression have been associated with lung diseases such as cancer  <cit> . it may be the case that mirna expression is maintained in healthy but senescent tissue and only during diseased states do perturbations in normal expression take place.

unlike developing lung tissue, there were no significant changes in the expression of any individual mirna in the aged lung  compared to normal adult lung. these findings are in contrast to the observed changes in mrna expression in aged tissue  <cit>  and suggest that mirna encoding genes are transcribed by an independent mechanism. the average Δct value for all the mirnas expressed at  <dig> months was  <dig>  +/-  <dig>  and the average Δct value at  <dig> months was  <dig>  +/-  <dig> . therefore, no significant alteration in the overall regulation of mirnas was detected, as normal expression levels were maintained in the aged lung . these observations also contrast with those in c. elegans where a general down-regulation of mirna expression was observed  <cit>  and suggests that there are species differences. however, it must be remembered that mirnas involved in aging might still be identified given that new genes are being continually added to mirna databases and that we examined the expression of  <dig> of the  <dig> identified mammalian mirnas. furthermore, there might also be differences in mirna expression that are tissue specific, or that differ between female and male mice. nevertheless, the majority of recently discovered mirnas cluster within established mirna families that were represented in the rt-pcr taqman panel  <cit> . for this reason any changes in the expression of those mirnas analysed in this study are also likely to represent most of the recently discovered mirnas.

CONCLUSIONS
mirnas are thought to regulate multiple genes and at least a third of all known genes contain mirna recognition elements. indeed, the lack of alteration in mirna expression may buffer age-related changes in the expression of protein-encoding genes. furthermore, the sustained expression of mirnas may maintain tissue homeostasis and only in circumstances when mirna expression is altered, will pathological changes occur.
