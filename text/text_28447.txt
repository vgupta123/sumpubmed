BACKGROUND
enteropathogenic  and enterohaemorrhagic  escherichia coli represent two important classes of enteric pathogens. epec strains belonging to different serogroup  are a major cause of infant diarrhoea in many countries and are also associated with diarrhoea in most domestic animal species  <cit> . these strains can be classified into two groups: typical-epec strains , harbouring a specific plasmid named epec adherence factor , and atypical-epec strains , which do not carry this specific eaf plasmid. ehec strains have been responsible for individual cases, and small to large outbreaks in developed countries  <cit> . o157:h <dig> is the main serotype responsible for human illness in several countries. nevertheless non-o <dig> serogroups can also be associated frequently with severe disease in humans and o <dig> serogroup represent the second more important serogroup in europe  <cit> . syndromes caused in humans are diverse: undifferentiated diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis , haemolytic uremic syndrome  and thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura   <cit> . transmission often occurs via consumption of foodstuffs contaminated by faeces from ruminants , which can be asymptomatic healthy carriers  <cit> . nevertheless, several serogroups of ehec strains  are also associated with diarrhoea in calves  <cit> .

epec and ehec share four stages in their pathogenicity:  colonisation of the intestine by specific adhesins,  translocation of a signal into the enterocyte by the type iii secretion system  of the bacteria and integration of the translocated intimin receptor  into the host cell membrane,  intimate adhesion of bacteria to eukaryote cells by specific adhesins  that bind to tir, and  actin polymerization after tir phosphorylation. these four stages allow the bacteria to produce a specific lesion called an "attaching and effacing  lesion"  <cit> . furthermore, as well as using the tir phosphorylation pathway, some strains  are able to utilize the t3ss effector tccp <dig>  to trigger actin polymerization, which leads to the formation of a pedestal characteristic of the a/e lesion  <cit> .

sequence variations in the tir receptor-, intimin adhesin- and tccp <dig> effector-encoding genes  have been described between ehec and epec strains, and these can lead to major or minor polymorphisms  of the encoded proteins  <cit> . major variants of tir and intimin are related, to some extent, to the serogroups of the ehec and epec strains, whereas minor variants can exist within a serogroup for the same major variant, although these have not often been defined  <cit> . ehec and epec strains belonging to the o <dig> serogroup classically produce the beta major variant of tir and intimin, but their minor variants have not been studied  <cit> . only two major variants of tccp have been described that are related to the pathotype of the strain  <cit> . ehec and epec strains of o <dig> serogroup produce the tccp <dig> variant with six minor variants identified  <cit> .

the purposes of this study were  to investigate the polymorphism of the tir, eae and tccp <dig> genes between o <dig> epec and ehec strains isolated from bovines and from humans; and  to determine whether these polymorphisms are specific to bovine or human strains.

RESULTS
detection of tir, eae and tccp <dig> genes
all the tested strains of serogroup o <dig> were found to possess β type eae and tir genes. moreover, of the  <dig> tested strains,  <dig> strains  presented one or several polymorphisms in these two genes. none of the polymorphic strains possessed polymorphism in both eae and tir genes. concerning tccp <dig> detection,  <dig> of the  <dig> strains  were positive for this gene. most of the strains possessed tccp <dig> variants described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  three strains had tccp <dig> genes respectively described in strains of serogroup o <dig>  o <dig> and o <dig> 

polymorphisms in the eae gene
for the eae gene, four polymorphisms were detected in nucleotide positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in eae β gene reference strain 14i <dig>   and five unique eae β genotypes were defined . the "classical" genotype  was represented by 93%  of the strains and the four other genotypes were represented by only one or two strains. even though there was no statistical significance , all the strains that presented polymorphism were bovine epecs. one polymorphism was non-synonymous and gave one genotype different in the amino-acid  sequence: valine was coded in place of alanine in aa position  <dig>  this aa is situated in the d <dig> ig-like domain.

polymorphisms in the tir gene
for the tir gene, five polymorphisms were detected in nucleotide positions  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in tir β genes reference strain 95zg <dig>  and four unique tir β genotypes were defined . interestingly, one polymorphism  was found to be present in all the strains. one genotype was represented by 93%  of the strains, and the other three genotypes were represented by only one or two strains. two polymorphisms were found to be non-synonymous and gave three different genotypes in the aa sequences: for the first polymorphism, serine was coded in place of alanine in aa position 45; for the second polymorphism, three aa  were inserted into aa position  <dig>  these two polymorphisms were situated in the n-terminal part of the gene. nevertheless, when we compared polymorphisms regarding the host and the pathotype , none was found to be specific to the bovine or the human isolates  or to epec or ehec pathotype.

polymorphisms in the tccp <dig> gene
for the tccp <dig> gene, seven genotypes  were detected in the collection. all had been previously described  <cit> . the tccp <dig> variant described in reference strain  <dig>  was found to be present in 34%  of the strains. the tccp <dig> variant described in reference strain ec38/ <dig>  was present in 17%  of the strains. tccp <dig> variants described in reference strains  <dig> and cb <dig>  were both present in 6%  of the strains. three tccp <dig> variants described in reference strains ed <dig>  ed <dig> and  <dig>  were represented by only one strain each. none of the variants was found to be specific to the bovine or the human isolates . nevertheless, the two major variants were statistically associated with the pathotype : the tccp <dig> gene ab <dig> was statistically associated with the epec strains in comparison with the ehec strains and the tccp <dig> gene ab <dig> was statistically associated with the ehec strains in comparison with the epec strains.

discussion
the tir receptor  and the intimin adhesin  are both implicated in the adherence of the epec and ehec strains to eukaryotic cells via the binding of the intimin to the tir receptor . the a/e lesion is then produced and is characterized by the loss of microvilli and intimate attachment of the bacteria to the host cell. moreover, non-o <dig> strains can utilize tccp <dig>  as well as tir, to trigger actin polymerization during the production of the a/e lesion  <cit> . there are variations in the eae, tir and tccp <dig> gene sequence and many variants have been described  <cit> . nevertheless small variations  inside the same variants have not often been described. in  <dig>  bono et al. <cit>  studied the polymorphism of tir and eae genes in o <dig> strains and associated two tir polymorphisms with the isolate source . with this in mind, we performed the present work to study the polymorphism of the tir, eae and tccp <dig> genes existing in o <dig> epec and ehec strains isolated from bovines and from humans with a view to determinate whether these polymorphisms are specific to bovine or human strains in the o <dig> serogroup.

tccp <dig> variants were found to be present in  <dig> % of the tested strains. this is not surprising regarding the results obtained by ooka et al. and ogura et al., who respectively found the tccp <dig> gene in  <dig> % of o <dig> a-epec strains and in  <dig> % of o <dig> ehec strains  <cit> . it is possible that the negative isolates use only the tir phosphorylation pathway or that they utilize another unknown pathway. moreover, the distribution of tccp <dig> variants appears to be specific to the pathotype. in our study, tccp <dig> variant  originally described in the o <dig> ehec  <dig> reference strain was found to be statistically associated to ehec strains in our study and tccp <dig> variant  originally described in o <dig> a-epec ec38/ <dig> reference strain was found to be statistically associated to a-epec strains. however, further studies need to be performed in order to confirm this pathotype specificity. if this association appears to be confirmed, it could be used as a tool to study, among other things, o <dig> epec strains  in order to determine if these strains are "real" o <dig> epec strains or o <dig> ehec strains that have lost stx genes <cit> .

in comparison with o <dig> strains, o <dig> strains do not possess a large number of polymorphisms in the tir gene . by contrast, eae polymorphisms are, in both studies, very limited. bono et al. explained this difference in polymorphism frequency  among o <dig> strains by the fact that both genes have evolved under a different kind of selective pressure. the difference in tir polymorphism frequency between o <dig> and o <dig> strains could also be explained by a different kind of selective pressure between both serogroups. currently, we know that o <dig> ehec strains and o <dig> ehec and epec strains possess two different actin signalling pathways  <cit> . the o <dig> ehec strains use only the tccp adaptor to induce actin polymerization and the o <dig> ehec and epec strains can use two other pathways: the tccp <dig> adaptor and the phosphorylation of y <dig> tir residue. therefore, it is not surprising that tir polymorphisms are more frequent in o <dig> ehec strains than in o <dig> ehec and epec strains.

furthermore, the polymorphisms in tir and eae genes revealed by our study are mainly synonymous. for the eae gene, only one polymorphism was found to be non-synonymous  and this is situated in the d <dig> ig-like domain. this polymorphism is not surprising and the consequences on the protein structure are probably nil for two reasons: firstly, in the eae ζ gene, valine is situated at this position and secondly, d <dig> is a divergent region that is not entirely conserved  <cit> . for the tir gene, two polymorphisms were found here to be non-synonymous and these are located near the amino terminus of tir. this region is normally situated in the host cytosol after tir translocation and is probably implicated in pedestral length, pedestral efficiency and translocation in the host cell  <cit> .

finally, concerning host specificity, in contrast to o <dig> strains  <cit> , our study revealed that tir and eae polymorphisms are not associated with the host . in comparison to o <dig> strains, which seem to be host classifiable using nucleotide polymorphisms  <cit> , we were unable to distinguish o <dig> strains. several studies have suggested that o <dig> strains can be separated into two distinct lineages , which appear to have distinct ecological characteristics, and which are associated with the host  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, tir and eae genes of o <dig> ehec and epec strains are well conserved. polymorphisms are not numerous or predominantly synonymous. moreover, no difference was observed between human and bovine strains regarding the presence of polymorphisms. finally, tccp <dig> variants appear to be pathotype specific. further investigations need to be performed on a larger number of strains in order to confirm this specificity.
