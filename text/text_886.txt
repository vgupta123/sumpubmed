BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental, ubiquitous γ-proteobacterium that is also an important opportunistic human pathogen  <cit> . in contrast to other bacterial pathogens, p. aeruginosa genomes of clinical and environmental isolates are highly conserved, and all isolates are able to produce virulence-associated traits and are thus potential pathogens  <cit> .

the pathogenicity of this bacterium depends on the production and secretion of multiple virulence factors that are regulated at the transcriptional level by the so-called quorum sensing  response  <cit> . this genetic response is mediated by the bacterial production of acyl-homoserine lactones  that act as signal molecules interacting with transcriptional regulators of the luxr family. pseudomonas aeruginosa qs is a hierarchical regulatory cascade: lasr interacts with 3-oxo-dodecanoyl-homoserine lactone , produced by the lasi enzyme, and activates the transcription of lasi, and of several genes coding for virulence factors. it also activates transcription of rhlr, which encodes the second qs transcriptional regulator, and of rhli, which encodes the enzyme that produces butanoyl-homoserine lactone , which is the autoinducer that interacts with rhlr  <cit> . rhlr/c4-hsl in turn promotes the expression of genes responsible for the production of several virulence factors. these include among others, pyocyanin, lectin pa-il , and biosurfactant rhamnolipids .

this bacterium represents an important public health problem, as one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections  <cit>  and as an infectious agent for cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> . additionally, the high level of antibiotic resistance shown by this bacterium  <cit>  makes it very difficult to treat p. aeruginosa infections.

the first p. aeruginosa genome to be completely sequenced was that of the type strain pao <dig>  <cit> , which was described in  <dig>  as an isolate from the wound of a patient in australia  <cit> . at present, the genome sequences of twelve clinical isolates and of a strain isolated from watermelon rhizosphere  have been reported . strain m <dig> produces higher levels of phenazine-carboxylic acid , the precursor of pyocyanin, at 30°c than at 37°c  <cit> , and the hierarchy of the autoinducer-based transcriptional regulation of virulence associated traits, i.e. the qs response, is different to that of the type strain pao <dig>  <cit> . however, the genomes of clinical and environmental isolates, including strain m <dig> are very highly conserved  <cit> . this high sequence identity at the genome level is not observed in other bacterial species, such as escherichia coli <cit> , or even in other pseudomonas species  <cit> . furthermore, it has been reported that the sequenced genomes of p. aeruginosa strains, including pao <dig>  show more than 95% sequence identity in the genes of their core genomes. the only sequenced genome that shows a slightly lower sequence identity is that of the multiresistant strain pa <dig> isolated in argentina, which belongs to a different clade  <cit> .

it is difficult to explain the high degree of genomic conservation between p. aeruginosa clinical and environmental isolates, and one possible explanation is that all genomes sequenced to date belong to a subpopulation of this bacterial species, and thus do not represent the real genomic diversity of the species. in this respect, the existence of environmental strains with higher genomic variability, similar to that presented by other bacteria, would show that clinical and human related environmental isolates constitute a subpopulation that does not represent the real amount of genomic diversity within this bacterial species. we tested this genomic variability hypothesis by carrying out the genomic characterization of three p. aeruginosa strains isolated from non-human related environments, and one strain isolated from dolphin stomach, and compared them with the genomes of twelve clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa and strain m <dig> .

*corresponds to a genome draft.

the characterized environmental isolates are: strain id <dig>  a marine isolate from the indian ocean which produces very high levels of pyoverdins and phenazines  <cit> ; strain m <dig>  that was isolated from the water spring of the churince system at cuatro cienegas, coahuila, mexico ; and strain igb <dig>  which is a highly lipolytic strain isolated in the rainforest of the mexican state of chiapas from a rotten coconut  <cit> . we also studied strain  <dig> , since it was isolated from a dolphin kept in captivity in a marine aquarium in cancún, quintana roo, mexico and it enabled us to determine whether pathogenic interactions with mammals were possibly being selected in the p. aeruginosa genomic content, and therefore, whether strain  <dig> was probably more closely related to clinical strains than to those isolated from the ocean water column or other wild environments.

the genomic similarity of strain m <dig> to clinical p. aeruginosa strains  suggests that clinical isolates are not a subpopulation of p. aeruginosa, which is the main question of our research, but it is still possible that strain m <dig> is a particular case that does not reflect the general situation of environmental p. aeruginosa strains.

in this work we show that the three environmental strains studied, and the dolphin-associated strain, are all pathogenic and phenotypically diverse with respect to production of virulence factors and motility. however, this phenotypic diversity is not reflected in genomic variability, since their genomes have a very high degree of similarity. furthermore, detailed comparison of all the orthologous proteins encoded in the genomes of the seventeen p. aeruginosa strains studied in this work , shows that the genomes of such a diverse group of p. aeruginosa strains  are surprisingly similar, thus having a large proportion of their genome conserved between them . we also found that the genomes of the four isolates described in this study  harbor sequences that have been reported to be part of genomic islands  that have been related to pathogenic phenotypes  <cit> , suggesting that these strains share genetic information with clinical isolates. however the four studied strains do not show antibiotic resistance, suggesting that the high incidence of multi-resistant strains among clinical isolates is due to selection pressures for these traits caused by the use of antibiotics for the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections.

the database of all the protein families, their abundance and the known molecular functions encoded by the genomes of the seventeen p. aeruginosa strains analyzed in this work, is provided . this constitutes a contribution for researchers working with this opportunistic bacterium.

RESULTS
phenotypic characterization of three environmental and a dolphin-associated p. aeruginosa strains
we tested the resistance-pattern of strains id <dig>  m <dig>  igb <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> antibiotics  and found that all four were sensitive to all antibiotics tested. the multisensitive pattern of these strains is completely different to the patterns shown by a collection of  <dig> p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, which are predominantly multi-resistant  <cit> . the result obtained is expected since neither the environmental strains nor the dolphin-associated strain have been subjected to selection by the presence of antibiotics used in the treatment of p. aeruginosa infections.

we tested the virulence of the studied p. aeruginosa strains by intraperitoneal injection of mice. we found that the strains id <dig>  m <dig>  igb <dig> and  <dig> were pathogenic to mice, but that they were only 60% to 80% as virulent as the clinical pao <dig> strain . if this group of strains constituted a subpopulation of p. aeruginosa, the virulence of the three environmental strains would not be expected, since virulence would then be a feature of clinical isolates and strains that live in environments close to humans. in this regard, we expected environmental strains to have a considerably reduced virulence, if at all, but the virulence pattern coincides with that of other strains previously described  <cit> .

*the number between parentheses corresponds to the number of colony forming units that were injected intraperitoneally to each one of the five mice used in each assay.

to determine whether these four strains  were able to kill mice by a similar mechanism as that reported for pao <dig> and other p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, we measured their production of three qs-regulated virulence factors: rhamnolipids, pyocyanin and elastase . the genes coding for synthesis of rhamnolipids and pyocyanin are regulated by rhlr/c4-hsl, whereas the gene for elastase is regulated by lasr/3o-c12-hsl  <cit> . the production of qs-regulated virulence factors was determined at 30°c, an environmental temperature, and at 37°c, the human body temperature.

strains analyzed compared to the type strain pao1
a


arhamnolipids , pyocyanin  and elastase  production was determined after 24 hours of growth at 30°c and 37°c. nd* means not detected. swimming  and swarming  phenotypes were determined as described in materials and method section. examples of motility phenotypes are shown in the supplementary materials.

in contrast to what has been reported for the clinical strains pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains , we found that the indian ocean isolate, strain id <dig> produces high levels of pyocyanin at 37°c  <cit>  and even higher levels at 30°c . this pattern of thermoregulation is similar to that reported for strain m <dig>  <cit> , but the marine strain id <dig> lacks the sequence present in the 3’ region of the operon phza1b1c1d1e1f1g <dig> that has been implicated in thermoregulation in strain m <dig>  <cit> .

even though strain id <dig> is quite distinct to pao <dig> with respect to the thermoregulation of pyocyanin production, it is very similar regarding production of rhamnolipids, c4-hsl and rhlr concentration at the two tested temperatures, since all these traits are expressed at higher levels at 37°c . however c4-hsl levels produced by this strain are much higher than those produced by either pao <dig> or the other three p. aeruginosa strains studied in this work . another characteristic of strain id <dig> is its low production of 3o-c12-hsl, lasr and elastase activity . this strain is unable to swim or swarm .

strain m <dig>  the water-spring isolate, produces similar levels of rhamnolipids, pyocyanin, elastase , 3o-c12-hsl autoinducer  and lasr  to those produced by pao <dig>  but its production of rhamnolipids and pyocyanin is higher at 30°c than at 37°c . another particular feature of this strain is the low concentration of rhlr and c4-hsl produced at both temperatures tested .

pseudomonas aeruginosa has been found to establish pathogenic interactions with different hosts including plants  <cit> . strain igb <dig> can be considered not only an environmental strain, but also a potential plant pathogen, since it was isolated from a rotten fruit. we found that this strain produces very low levels of pyocyanin at either temperature tested , and that rhamnolipids production is not thermoregulated, as it is in strains pao <dig>  id <dig> and  <dig> .

strain  <dig>  isolated from a dolphin stomach shows the same pattern of thermoregulation of rhamnolipids, c4-hsl and rhlr production as pao <dig> type strain , but its pyocyanin production is higher at 30°c than at 37°c . this strain completely lacks elastase activity and production of 3o-c12-hsl. we were unable to detect the presence of lasr .

contrary to what has been found for two p. aeruginosa clinical isolates, pao <dig> and pa <dig> , three of the strains studied in this work , synthesize higher levels of pyocyanin at an environmental temperature than at the human body temperature .

strain  <dig> is unable to swim or swarm . the non-motility of the two strains isolated from marine-related habitats  suggests that this might be a common phenotype among p. aeruginosa living in the sea. the non-motile phenotype of strain  <dig> is due to multiple mutations in flic and flid genes . however the genomic basis of the strain id <dig> inability to swim or swarm was not detected, since there are no-apparent mutations in the different genes involved in swimming or swarming that were analyzed .

analysis of qs-dependent genes
detailed analysis of the sequence of qs-dependent genes such as rhla, rhlb, rhlr, rhli, leca, lasb, and lasi showed that they are identical in the four p. aeruginosa strains studied , and that is also the case for lasr in the three environmental isolates. genome assembly of these four strains does not enable the full-length sequence annotation of the duplicated phza1b1c1d1e1f1g <dig> and phza2b2c2d2e2f2g <dig> operons since they are nearly identical and all of the sequences collapse into a single contig. this is a well-known problem for duplicated sequences in genome assembly. in order to determine whether both operons are present in the four strains, we amplified the 5’ regions of both operons using pao <dig> dna as a control. we found that both phz operons are present in strains  <dig>  id <dig>  igb <dig> and m <dig> .

interestingly, we found that the dolphin-associated strain  <dig> contains a  <dig>  base pair deletion, which eliminated a region of the chromosome that corresponds to nucleotide  <dig> , <dig> to nucleotide  <dig> , <dig> of the pao <dig> chromosome sequence. one end of this deletion is situated inside the homolog of pa <dig>  and the other end inside the intergenic region between lasr and lasi. this chromosomal deletion in strain  <dig> eliminates the lasr gene and the lasi promoter, thus explaining the lack of expression in this strain of lasr, 3o-c12-hsl and elastase. this chromosomal deletion in strain  <dig> was confirmed by pcr . thus the only apparent difference in the qs-related genes of the p. aeruginosa strains described in this study is this chromosomal deletion of nearly 20 kb in the dolphin-associated strain  <dig>  that eliminates lasr and the lasi promoter region . the isolation of this strain, which is pathogenic, but lacks the qs-regulator lasr and its cognate autoinducer 3o-c12-hsl, constitutes a challenge to the current model for explaining the mechanism of p. aeruginosa virulence, and to the rationale for searching compounds that inhibit lasr activity as a means to treat infections caused by this bacterium  <cit> .

the comparisons, using rna-seq, of transcriptomes from three environmental p. aeruginosa strains showed that the expression of quorum-sensing related genes is widely different, but that the master quorum-sensing regulators in all of them are well conserved  <cit> . recently it was reported that two p. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients showed a wide phenotypic variability, even though both strains have a highly conserved genome sequence  <cit> . these observations are completely in accordance with the results presented in this work.

we have been unable to detect the genomic characteristics responsible for the low level of expression of the las regulon in strain id <dig>  nor the very high levels of pyocyanin that it produces, particularly at 30°c . the genomic basis responsible for particular phenotypic characteristics of the four studied strains, which are different to those of clinical isolates, are also not clear.

the high genomic conservation of p. aeruginosa strains, however, is not reflected in a homogeneous pattern of qs-regulated virulence-traits expression. in this work we detected one strain that does not produce pyocyanin , two other strains that do not produce elastase , and one strain  that does not produce the autoinducer 3o-c12-hsl, nor the lasr protein . we detected that, contrary to the case of pao <dig> and pa <dig> strains  <cit> , higher levels of pyocyanin are produced at 30°c rather than at 37°c by the three studied strains that synthesize this phenazine, even though rhlr and the autoinducer c4-hsl tend to be produced at higher levels at 37°c by all the four strains studied. despite these differences, all strains are virulent on the mice model, but show a slightly lower virulence than pao <dig> strain . it is our interest to determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie the different patterns of qs-regulated virulence trait expression on strains  <dig>  id <dig>  igb <dig> and m <dig> 

presence of genomic islands in strains  <dig>  id <dig>  igb <dig> and m10
all sequenced p. aeruginosa strains sequenced to date show dna sequences inserted in the core genome that are strain-specific or shared only by a fraction of isolates, which appeared to be transferred horizontally between strains  <cit> . among these insertions, called genomic islands , there are some that are implicated in pathogenic interactions, and are thus assumed to be a characteristic of clinical isolates. the resistance to multiple antibiotics is also assumed to be only present in clinical isolates.

it was recently reported that a collection of p. aeruginosa clinical isolates has a high incidence of gis  <cit> . the best characterized p. aeruginosa gis related to pathogenicity are pagi- <dig> to pagi- <dig>  papi- <dig>  papi- <dig> and pklc <dig>  <cit> , but it has not been determined whether these elements can also be found in environmental isolates. we therefore searched for the presence of gis in the chromosome of strains  <dig>  id <dig>  igb <dig> and m <dig>  and found that all four contain at least one orf that has been reported to be part of gis . the marine strain id <dig> has the highest number of gis-related genes . this result reinforces the observation that environmental and clinical p. aeruginosa isolates do not constitute different subpopulations, and that gis sequences are transferred horizontally between strains present in environments that are not close to humans and clinical strains.

p. aeruginosa core and pan-genome analysis
global analysis of seventeen p. aeruginosa strains  was performed by best reciprocal blast hits  of all the proteins encoded in their genomes. using this analysis we found that the p. aeruginosa core genome consists of  <dig>  orthologous encoding genes present in all the seventeen strains analyzed. considering that some of the genes in the core genome are part of paralogous gene families we determined a total of  <dig>  core genes in all the seventeen p. aeruginosa strains analyzed.

another approach to determine the core genome is by means of clustering its predicted genes and quantifying genes present in all the strains analyzed and having ≥80% amino-acid identity. we were able to group  <dig>  predicted genes into  <dig>  protein families, which comprise the protein-clustering core. both bbh and relaxed protein clustering  share a common set of  <dig>  core genes clustered into  <dig>  protein families. a venn diagram displaying the shared genes between each one of the genomes and the environment from which the strains were isolated is shown in figure  <dig> 

this conserved genomic structure of p. aeruginosa is completely different to that reported for other bacterial species. a unique feature is that the core genome of this species constitutes more than 80% of its genetic repertoire and that its pan-genome is considerably smaller than the ones previously defined for other bacteria. for example the analysis of  <dig> sequenced escherichia coli genomes showed that only  <dig> genes were present in all the genomes analyzed , and that this represented only 6% of the total number of gene families identified  <cit> .

using a genomic similarity score   <cit>  which depicts the overall similarity of the pairwise shared orthologs for selected genomes of the pseudomonas genus, and the information of all the pairwise shared genes across all the isolates of pseudomonas sp. completed genome sequences, we were able to build a dendrogram showing the overall genomic similarity . it is clear from the resulting gss-tree  that all p. aeruginosa strains cluster in a single branch, which includes even strain pa <dig>  which has been reported to be an outlier  <cit> . in the p. aeruginosa branch, strains life-styles and hosts are mixed , supporting the view that at the overall genomic level, human pathogenic strains are not a special structured subgroup within p. aeruginosa.

the analysis of the core genome and of the pan-genome by gss provides the opportunity to get a broader view of the shared features across all the strains and to highlight the differences that can help us to understand particular niche adaptation strategies. the complete list of predicted proteins of the p. aeruginosa pan-genome and their distribution among strains is a valuable tool for the identification of genes that might code for traits that are important for niche adaptation . particularly, this is a valuable resource to target human-related traits for diagnosis and direct therapy efforts. in this respect, the group of human-related p. aeruginosa strains is the one with the largest number of unique genes . the high number of unique genes in this group might be due to the over-representation of these strains among our sample . among the isolates from humans, there are several examples of genes that might be related to virulence, like those coding for a transcription regulator of the arac family with high similarity to cdhr transcription regulators  <cit> , fimbria related proteins, type iv secretion system, and adhesion related proteins, for example.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the analysis of the genome sequence of three environmental and one dolphin-associated p. aeruginosa strains shows that their genomic content is extremely well conserved among them and with respect to previously sequenced strains . the seventeen strains analyzed , which have representatives of isolates from diverse environments , grouped as a single clade with very low genetic diversity. the inset in figure  <dig> shows that there is no such thing as a subgroup of the species that clusters apart based on the isolation environment. strains isolated from humans distribute evenly and across the p. aeruginosa cluster and they can be more closely related to water, dolphin or plant isolated strains than to each other. furthermore we found that the core genome defined as the number of proteins that are encoded in all the seventeen genomes sequences analyzed in detail represents a high proportion  of the total number of proteins encoded in them. these results rule out the possibility that clinical strains constitute a subpopulation of p. aeruginosa and that the genetic variability of this bacterial species is presented in environmental isolates. our results reinforce previously reported results that suggest that genetic variability of p. aeruginosa is extremely low with high levels of recombination within the species  <cit> .

the extremely high sequence similarity among different p. aeruginosa isolates is difficult to explain. one possibility to account for this high degree of genetic conservation between p. aeruginosa strains isolated from such diverse habitats would be that these bacteria have an inefficient mechanism of dna exchange, but this does not seem to be the case as judged by the prevalence of gis among clinical  <cit>  and environmental isolates , and the population studies suggesting high levels of homologous recombination  <cit> . other possibilities for explaining the low genetic variability of p. aeruginosa are that the population size of this bacterium is very low, or that a mechanism of gene conversion exists among different strains. these possibilities remain to be evaluated.

the high degree of sequence conservation of p. aeruginosa strains makes it a difficult task to device strategies for the treatment of infections caused by these bacteria that are based on vaccination or hygiene measures, and strengthens the need for designing strategies that inhibit the expression of virulence associated traits to contend with p. aeruginosa infections. novel mechanisms of virulence inhibition, which take into account all the phenotypic diversity of this ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen, remain to be discovered.
