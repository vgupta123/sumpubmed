BACKGROUND
influenza caused by influenza a viruses occurs in both birds and mammals. in humans, influenza a viruses infect hundreds of millions individuals, causing a high number of deaths per year. indeed, influenza a outbreaks occurred in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> resulted in death for ~ <dig> million people worldwide  <cit> . however, seasonal epidemic outbreaks cause estimated  <dig>  to  <dig>  yearly deaths worldwide  <cit>    <cit>  and from the center for disease control and prevention  <cit> ). the largest reservoir of all subtypes of influenza a is found in wild water avian species and some viruses can infect different hosts  <cit> . classification of influenza type a virus subtypes is based on antigenic and genetic differences in the two surface spike proteins: haemagglutinin  and neuraminidase. for instance, h5n <dig> viruses combine the haemagglutinin of the h <dig> subtype with neuraminidase of the n <dig> subtype. a wide interest for haemagglutinin depends on evidence that this protein  is crucial to the attachment and penetration into the host cell,  represents the main viral surface antigen, and  is a major player in the stimulation of the neutralizing antibody response  <cit> . haemagglutinin is synthesized as a precursor and then processed by cellular proteases to yield mature polypeptide subregions. in order to provide unambiguos information, hereafter acronyms for haemagglutinin are the followings: ‘ha’ for haemagglutinin in general; ha <dig> for the precursor; ha <dig> and ha <dig> for the two subregions and ‘h’ followed by progressive numbering  for each haemagglutinin subtype. influenza virus haemagglutinin is a type i transmembrane glycoprotein that is exposed at the viral surface as a homotrimer. trimerization is possible once proteolytic cleavage of the unfolded ha <dig> precursor occurs hence allows for folding of monomers, each consisting of two mature chains: ha <dig> and ha <dig>  <cit> . structurally, each monomer consists of a globular ‘head’  and of a ‘stem’ region . the head includes a receptor-binding domain  and a vestigial esterase domain , whereas the stem is structured as a mainly α helical, coiled coil region. functionally, the rbd mediates docking to the host cell by binding sialic acids as cell entry receptors, whereas the stem domain mediates both tethering and membrane fusion once conformational change is occurred, caused by ph decreasing along the endosomal route. for several years, classification of ha from influenza viruses was mainly based upon serological and/or phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . however, structural genomics projects are providing the scientific community with an increasing number of structural templates, while contemporary reverse genetics, immunogenomics investigations and improved sequencing technologies are producing a high number of mutant sequences. changes in serological specificity depend on variation of epitopes recognized by the specific antibody rather than on the extent of sequence divergence, meaning i.e. that  two proteins with highly similar sequences may show quite different properties when considering recognition of specific epitopes and  two proteins may share antigenic properties even when having highly divergent sequences, if epitopes involved in the specific recognition were conserved. variation of some protein properties sometimes may depend only on ‘local and limited changes’, e.g. mutation of a few - or even only one – residue within linear or conformational motifs. in fact, even when local variation in sequence is seemingly poorly evident, it may result in ‘locally dramatic’ changes in accessible surface area, electrostatic potential, hydropathy or hydrophilicity features that can deeply change motif functionality. it is common knowledge that variation in surface features of a protein can modulate ‘recognition’ interactions of the protein itself. since variation often depends on mutation of a number of residues and changes in side chains can vary multiple biochemical features, it is difficult or even nonsense trying to establish a priori which specific property  should be more relevant than others in modulating recognition interactions. in fact, changes in each specific property can result in such modulation, and this can be independent on variation of other features, or modulation can result from the aggregate or synergistic effect of multiple feature changes. so far, several sequence-based studies on variation could provide valuable phylogenetic evidence; however, such studies are of minor help in inferring variation at protein regions including amino acids that are far each other in the primary sequence and quite close within the 3d protein structure . in practice, while sequence-based investigation can be good in highlighting very evident changes at individual positions of a protein chain, in general they fail in highlighting meaningful ‘group variation’, i.e. in identifying - especially when the overall variation is relevant and spread - relationship of specific multiple changes to variation in conformational epitopes hence in interactions they mediate.

once solved structures are available, presence of one or more structural templates allows for shifting to ‘conformational epitope based’ studies on variation and, in particular, to investigating on surface region variation. stressing relevance of local surface variation is particularly important when considering special constraints addressing viruses evolution: keeping basic properties in simplified but complex pathogenic systems while simultaneously varying - as much as possible - all variable epitopes, in order to escape the immune responses of their hosts. therefore, viral genome evolution runs along two parallel tracks, both of which, like in railways, must be followed:  mutations in sites crucial to protein machinery mediating basic functions  are not allowed because they strongly impair viral fitness, and at the same time,  hyper-variability is needed to escape recognition by neutralizing antibodies . given that surface viral proteins do not interact only with antibodies , in addition to determining antigenic drift, variation can also influence pathogenicity  or host specificity. influenza viruses do not escape such a two-tracks rule, hence while global structure conservation ensures basic functions, limited or even subtle changes in local structural features may modulate interactions of the viral proteins with the host molecules/cells and thus mechanisms underlying antigenic drift, pathogenicity shifts and host specificity change. phylogenetically and serologically, haemagglutinins are divided into either two supergroups or four groups: group  <dig> ; group  <dig> ; group  <dig>  and group  <dig> . the two supergroups consist of groups 1 +  <dig> and 3 +  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . thanks to the availability of thousands of viral genomes/gene sequences and of several specific antibodies/vaccines, a large number of sequence-based/phylogenetic and serological analyses of avian flu viruses have been performed and published so far. this notwithstanding, mechanisms in viral evolution are still elusive, as genome/proteome-wide analyses on sequence variation or antigenic features are able to only partially unveil a number of relevant changes, because of the overall mutational noise. therefore, structural ‘zoom in’ is needed to integrate such analyses by identifying ‘meaningful’ variation. this prompted us to take advantage from availability of structural templates to perform structural comparison among different ha subtypes, in order to identify subtype- and subregion-specific feature variation suggestive for possible involvement in antigenic recognition, or pathogenicity and host specificity. last but not least, evidence from structural comparison can check relationship among serological, phylogenetic and structural closeness.

we started our analyses using six currently available solved ha structures; then, in order to investigate structural variation possibly underlying h5n <dig> clades evolution and spreading, we also created clade models by homology modeling. the six ha structures solved so far: h <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , h <dig>  <cit> , all concern mature proteins, consisting of the two ha <dig> and ha <dig> parts of haemagglutinin. solved structure of h <dig>  <cit>  was not considered for this analysis because it corresponds to the ha <dig> precursor. comparative analysis of structural features unveiled that some discrepancy may occur with respect to a generally observed agreement between sequence and structural closeness, because of subregion local variation. structural analysis was performed by comparison of secondary structure topology and surface analysis, in terms of both electrostatic and hydropathy analysis.

RESULTS
comparison among solved ha structures
prior to creating models, preliminary analysis of the six available ha structures was performed in order to evaluate intra- and inter-group structural variation by superposition of all structure pairs and computation of their root mean square deviation . indeed, the rmsd of two superposed structures indicates their ‘structural divergence’ from one another. as both sequence mutation and conformational variation inflate the rmsd, values up to  <dig> Ångstrom indicate structural similarity  <cit> . structural superposition of each possible combination of two different ha molecules  and rmsd computing were performed using chimera  <dig> . <dig> software  <cit> . pair-wise method was chosen to calculate rmsd because all superpositions only compared pairs in order to properly relate a structural closeness index for a pair to identity/similarity values  from the corresponding aligned sequences. fold comparison method based on sequence fragmentation and order-independent resorting was not considered because order-dependent global alignment is an established standard for comparing highly similar sequences in structural biology and the alignment of sequence blocks for phylogenetic analyses is also order-dependent.

in addition to superposing structures of ha monomers, also corresponding structures of their receptor binding domains  were superposed. results are summarized in table  <dig>  evidence that rmsd values for monomer pairs are lower than those ones for corresponding ha <dig> or rbd regions is not surprising, because rbds are major determinants in antigenic variation  <cit> . moreover, ha <dig> ‘stem’ region of the monomer is structurally less variable than ha <dig>  <cit> , hence its contribution results in decreasing the overall monomer rmsd value. rmsd values for ha <dig> pairs are higher than corresponding rbds because of unstructured regions connecting rbds to stems. group  <dig> is - at least to date - the only ha group in which multiple structures  are solved. structural comparison within this group highlights some intriguing evidence. when comparing monomers amino acid sequences, h <dig> results to be closer to h <dig> than to h <dig>  independently on identity  or similarity  is considered. such relationship is confirmed for both ha <dig> and rbd sequences, as shown by identity and similarity values in table  <dig>  however, when comparing structures, h <dig> is closer to h <dig> than h <dig>  as in all comparisons, h5:h <dig> superposition rmsd values are lower than h5:h <dig> ones. commonly, % identity is taken into account as an index for relationship among proteins  <cit> . however, from a structural point of view, ‘type’ of mutations occurred - rather than the overall sequence divergence - is very important: a few mutations  to some specific residues in ‘critical’ regions can result in dramatic structural changes. structural fold and architecture can be highly conserved even among proteins and protein domains showing no sequence homology because of either long evolutionary divergence or even convergent evolution  <cit> . at the same time, within such families, fold can be disrupted  by single or few specific mutation, which indeed result in keeping 99% or higher sequence identity values  <cit> . in the structural comparison of h <dig> to haemagglutinins from different groups  further interesting points emerge. in the monomer comparison, % identity approximately ranges from  <dig> to 49%. the same 8% difference in % identity is retrieved in % similarity . however, rmsd for corresponding monomer pairs keep quite similar values, i.e. they are not impaired by lower % identity or similarity values. this is not surprising, because - as shown by aforementioned example  - very ancient divergence or convergence can result in fold conservation among proteins without significant sequence similarity. structural differences become clearly evident when comparison focuses on ha <dig> and rbd regions: h <dig> is quite closer to h <dig> than h <dig> and h <dig>  and in this instance substantial agreement between structural and sequence divergence is found. once again, a rationale for this is found when considering common properties of protein domains. different subregions of the same protein are involved in different interactions and pathways. therefore, molecular evolution can locally change subregion structures to modulate specific interactions and pathways, without affecting those ones mediated from other subregions of the same protein. in practice, only when structural variation analysis is performed at both overall and local level , it is possible to boost subsequent experimental work. in fact, subregion analysis allows for shedding light on specific molecular properties that are likely to underlie different functions of the protein. in conclusion, agreement between sequence homology and structural closeness which is generally observed  <cit>  has not to be strictly interpreted as ‘a rule’ to be followed. values from table  <dig> show that, in most instances, such an agreement is found. however, in several examples and depending on local variation, superimpositions between pairs with quite comparable % identity and similarity may show very different rmsd values and vice versa.table  <dig>

comparative analysis of secondary structure elements
available structures were superposed and then tiled using ucsf chimera  <dig> . <dig> to keep the same orientation and to avoid visual superposition. this way, variation of secondary structure elements among individual structures can be clearly distinguished and viewed. in order to exclude any artifact from modeling, only the six available solved structures were compared. in terms of secondary structure, three subregions can be distinguished within the ha <dig> stem : an α subregion and two β subregions . the former consists of α helices a-c-d and the b loop . no meaningful variation - in terms of secondary structure - is found in the α subregion of the stem, because structural changes only concern the b loop , which indeed is unfolded in the pre-fusion state. the b loop coordinates depend on crystallization conditions and in particular on ph  <cit> . the ved-proximal and distal β subregions are recognized by respectively antibodies cr <dig> and cr <dig>  <cit> . the ved-proximal β subregion shows a varying number  of β strands  and such variation is not relevant to antibody recognition specificity. for instance, a four-strands structure is shared between h <dig>  and h <dig> ; moreover, a two-strands structure is shared between h <dig>  and h <dig> . secondary structure variation is evident also in the distal β subregion , but once again it does not relate to antibody recognition: e.g., cr <dig> recognizes subregion from h <dig> but not corresponding one from h <dig>  given that subregions recognized by each antibody are clearly different  such a preliminary analysis demonstrates that secondary structure variation as viewed by cartoon representation is not indicative for epitope variation. secondary structure variation in the globular rbd-ved region is poorly evident, according to the aforementioned ‘two-tracks’ rule: mutations altering the overall backbone/fold of the rbd would impair binding to host cells hence conservation  is needed to keep such basic function. however, local variation  is needed to modulate surface features hence interactions. therefore, we did not further investigate secondary structure variation and moved instead to surface analysis, considering both most relevant features:  electrostatic charge distribution and  hydropathy/hydrophilicity patches.

comparative analysis of electrostatic potentials
in order to perform analyses taking into account the influence of ionic strength , the spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential was calculated at both i = 0 mm  and i = 150 mm , assuming +1/- <dig> charges for the counter-ions. prior to electrostatic potential calculations, partial charges and van der waals radii were assigned with pdb2pqr  <cit> ; then, linear poisson-boltzmann  equation calculations were carried out by using adaptive pb solver   <cit>  through opal web service . the spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential was determined for each ha subregion, monomers and trimers, comparing the six available ha structures to identify possible ha-specific signatures. in particular, we focused on the role of charge distribution as visualized by isopotential contours within the tertiary structure and on classifying conservation and divergence among the different has. in order to evaluate electrostatic distance  also in a quantitative way, clustering of the spatial distributions of the electrostatic potentials was obtained by webpipsa   <cit>  . the carbo si is sensitive to the shape of the potential being considered but not the magnitude, whereas the hodgkin si is sensitive to both shape and magnitude. therefore, webpipsa results obtained using the hodgkin si are shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and evidence from analyses performed using the carbo si is cited to confirm parameter independent data.figure  <dig>

stem subregions
the electrostatic patches at ionic strength i = 0 mm clearly show for all six stems preferential side disposition , as observed for snares  <cit> . in particular, density of negative potential  at the 0° side is higher than at the 180° side; positive potential  shows a reverse distribution, highest density being at the 180° side. at physiological ionic strength , preferential distribution of the positive potential  is more evident, whereas higher density in negative potential  is less evident, because most coulombic interactions are masked by counter-ions. when considering individual stem variation, net charge roughly doubles from the − <dig> e value of h <dig> and h <dig> to − <dig> e of h <dig>  however, similar net charge does not necessarily correspond to similar distribution  of the potential, that can preferentially locate at either the ved-distal stem subregion  or at the ved-proximal one . this is the case for h <dig> and h <dig> stem, sharing net charge − <dig> e, and showing  preferential ved-distal and ved-proximal negative potential, respectively. such preferential ved-distal location of the negative potential shown by h <dig> is conserved also in the other two stems from group  <dig>  in spite of their different net charge . positive potential is more homogeneously distributed along all stems. heat maps and corresponding density plots  depict the overall similarity among ha stem electrostatic profiles. comparison between the density plots at i = 0 mm and i = 150 mm highlights a general increase in distance, i.e. a peak shift from middle ed  to high ed . when comparing group  <dig> stems to those from other groups it can be noticed that - at both ionic concentrations - h <dig> is slightly closer to group  <dig> than h <dig>  while h <dig> is far apart. however, h <dig> distance is not homogeneous with respect to the three group  <dig> stems, as it is closer to h <dig> than to h <dig> and h <dig>  indeed, h <dig> stem is also quite far from h <dig> because it shows the highest overall distance, with respect to other stem structures. when using webpipsa, the distance matrix of the electrostatic potential can also be displayed as a tree referred to as ‘epogram’ . epograms  further highlight at both ionic concentrations that:  h <dig> stem shows unique electrostatic features  and  h <dig> is closer to h <dig> than to other stems. this clustering is confirmed when using carbo si. the highest electrostatic distance shown by h <dig> might depend on its mammalian  rather than avian origin. therefore, structural models were obtained by homology modeling for avian h <dig> , uniprotkb ac: g8ikb3) and horse h <dig> ; uniprotkb ac: j9tj60), using as structural templates 1jsd  and 1mql , respectively and investigated using webpipsa. comparison of epograms alternatively including either the avian h <dig> model or the swine template showed conservation of the highest distance observed for h9: at i = 0 mm, swine/avian epogram clustering was congruent; at i = 150 mm, avian h <dig> sorted with h <dig> and h7; this notwithstanding, highest distance of h <dig> from other has was anyway kept . concerning equine h <dig>  it sorted like avian h <dig> at both i = 0 mm and i = 150 mm . in conclusion, electrostatic distance is not significantly influenced by taxonomy hence segregation depends on ha-specific features.

rbd subregions
as with the stem subregion, charge separation onto the rbd surface is more evident at i = 0 mm. group  <dig> rbds have an overall slightly negative  or neutral  net charge, which is positive  in other groups. at large, the rbd net charge is less negative than stems . side disposition in rbds is not ‘side preferential’ as for stems, and no meaningful difference is observed when comparing the 0° and 180° views. however, preferential local distribution is clearly apparent also for rbds, when a roughly orthogonal axis is considered: negative charges are densely distributed at the ved-proximal region , whereas charge of the ved-distal region  is more positive. this is particularly evident for group  <dig> rbds at i = 0 mm. at physiological ionic strength, such preferential distribution is less evident, in particular for h <dig>  where differently charged patches are interspersed. peaks at the blue/purple regions in density plots  depict high electrostatic distances at both ionic strengths. surprisingly - and independently on using either hodgkin or carbo si - at i = 150 mm, the electrostatic potential of the h <dig> rbd is closer to h <dig> and h <dig> than to rbds from h <dig>  in spite h <dig> and h <dig> belong to the same group. splitting of group  <dig> is confirmed by epogram  at i = 150 mm: h <dig> and h <dig> create a new cluster with h <dig> and h <dig> 

ha <dig> subregions
once the electrostatic analysis is repeated for the whole ha <dig> region, including the ved and f’ subregions in addition to the rbd  <cit> , the most evident difference is an overall shift towards net positive charge , according to the presence of basic patches in f’ subregions  <cit> . comparison of density plots  shows that peaks similarly locate at the high distance blue/purple regions  but, at i = 150 mm, group  <dig> no longer splits, as h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig> form a cluster including h <dig>  resembling rbd distances, it also occurs with ha <dig> that members from group  <dig>  can be closer to an outgroup  than to a member of the same group  . this parameter independent evidence further highlights the relevance of counter-ions to shape the final electrostatic profile, as well as the possible disagreement between classic clustering  and electrostatics of the rbds.

monomers
the net charge is negative for all monomers, ranging -4e to -11e . evidence that the net charge is quite negative for all stems  while being close to  <dig> for rbds , stresses the total charge balancing by local basic patches in ved and f’ subregions. once again, peculiar electrostatic features are evident  for h <dig>  characterized by the less negative net charge and forming its own branch at both i = 0 mm and i = 150 mm . disagreement with serological and phylogenetic data is less evident when performing electrostatic analysis with entire monomer structures, as shown by clustering of group  <dig> members in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig> 

trimers
once the entire haemagglutinin functional unit is analyzed, disagreement with serological and phylogenetic clustering is highlighted again by group  <dig> splitting; in particular  at i = 0 mm, h <dig> sorts separately from h <dig> and h <dig> . such splitting is also observed at i = 150 mm, as h <dig> and h <dig> sort with h <dig> and h <dig>  whereas h <dig> sorts out with h <dig>  comparison of net charges from monomers and corresponding trimers unveils striking doubling vs. triplication mechanisms: trimer net charge values for h <dig> and h <dig> is roughly three-fold with respect to corresponding monomers, or even more  for h <dig>  instead, trimer values are only roughly twofold increased for h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  therefore, different orientations of monomers within corresponding trimers results in significant modulation of the trimer surface electrostatic charge and this in turn can be quite relevant to ha interactions. different ha clustering at i = 0 mm and i = 150 mm may highlight the importance of ionic screening of coulombic interactions  <cit> . as a final remark, based on absence of net charge-based clustering in any executed electrostatic analyses, the spatial distribution of electrostatic potential is suggested to be more suitable than net charge alone for eventual use as a further ‘signature’ for protein/domain function.

hydrophobicity analysis
search for ha-specific motifs/signatures can be integrated by hydropathy analysis. both electrostatics and hydrophobicity are key determinants in surface properties hence in regulating protein interactions. in particular, hydrophobic patches located at the protein surface create unstable areas. the identification of well-defined patches rather than a ‘patchwork surface’ of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas can thus shed light on molecular evolution of haemagglutinin. stem, rbd and ha <dig> profiles were obtained and compared using protscale  <cit>  and protein hydrophobicity plots  <cit> . profiles from the stem subregions did not unveil any clearly meaningful difference and thus are not shown here.

rbd subregions
figure  <dig> shows grand average hydrophobicity  indexes, kyte-doolittle plots and 0° +180° surface hydropathy views for the rbds from the six available ha structures. similar to total electrostatic charges, gravy indexes are reported here for completeness of information; however, they are not suitable for use as evolutionary or functional fingerprint. in fact, variation of gravy values amongst the six rbds does not correspond to high conservation and fine tuning of their surface patches as depicted in 0° and 180° views. however, comparison of kyte-doolittle plots could infer variation at specific positions. plots in figure  <dig> always start by residue  <dig> because the default numbering system from the software refers to analyzed sequence fragments ; therefore, for reader’s convenience, hereafter we report both real numbers  and software output numbers . within group  <dig>  the highest intra-group hydrophilicity is shown by h <dig> positions arg <dig>  of the 220-loop and by h <dig> at positions asn <dig>  ser <dig> and glu <dig> . at position  <dig> , h <dig> is significantly more hydrophobic  than h <dig> and h <dig> . inter-group comparison highlights in h <dig> three hydrophilic peaks centered on residues asp <dig>  thr <dig> and gln <dig> , as well as increased hydrophobicity of h <dig> in subregion 105– <dig> . comparative analysis of surface patches unveiled possible ha-specific fingerprints. within group  <dig>  variation concerns both the ved and rbd subregions. such variation is even more evident when extending comparison to h <dig>  h <dig> and h <dig>  hydrophobic patches  are variable in terms of position and area. comparison of 0° views highlights a large orange surface encompassing the ved-rbd border, specific to h <dig>  moreover, h <dig> and h <dig> show at the ved subregion a hydrophilic  surface  that in other has includes at least one small orange patch. comparison of 0° views shows that h <dig> and h <dig> share three hydrophobic spots in an rbd subregion  where other has can lack one, two or even all such spots. further variation can be observed, and in general it seems to concern ‘position-shifting’ rather than significant difference in the total ratio of hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces. therefore, combined variation in both electrostatic and hydropathy features is likely to fine tune local interaction properties of the different ha rbds.figure  <dig>

ha <dig> subregions
apart from differences already observed in the rbd subregion, no further meaningful variation was found among ha <dig> hydropathy profiles. the only relevant evidence concerns the hydrophilicity peak at position  <dig> in h <dig> haemagglutinin .

structural modeling of h5n <dig> clades and electrostatic features comparison
electrostatic features can vary among different types of haemagglutinins . this prompted us to further investigate on differential electrostatic features as a possible fingerprint for monitoring viral evolution, i.e. as a tool to distinguish among circulating/spreading and extinguished h5n <dig> clades. table  <dig> resumes relevant data concerning the ten clades used for this analysis; their geographical spread is shown in figure  <dig>  spreading of no longer circulating clades  is restricted to the eastern part of china and to vietnam ; noticeably, all such clades share one or more outbreak areas with the most ancient clade . among circulating clades, clade  <dig> was also found in western china and clade  <dig> also spread towards india and indochina countries . the widest spreading concerns circulating clade  <dig> , having reached japan and korea, mongolia, russia, several countries from middle-east and europe  as well as a number of african countries from the northern hemisphere. so far, spreading of h5n <dig> viruses neither concerns americas nor any country from the southern hemisphere .table  <dig>

based on a very high, average % identity  of the clade target sequences with the available structural h <dig> template , structural models for clades  <dig> to  <dig> were obtained by homology. given that distribution of surface charge is strongly influenced by the orientation of side chains, models refinement was performed using a number of tools based on different algorithms: scwrl  <cit> , modrefiner  <cit>  and scit  <cit> . then, qmean server was used to check model quality; qmean is a scoring function that measures multiple geometrical aspects of protein structure, ranging  <dig> to  <dig> with higher values indicating more reliable models  <cit> . qmean scores for each refined or not refined model  and the average qmean score for each ten clades model series  was calculated. models refined by scwrl showed the highest aqmean , with highest mqmean for clades  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  however, quality was similarly good when models were not refined  or refined by modrefiner , confirming once again reliability and robustness of the swiss-model homology modeling method  <cit> . scit refined models showed the lowest average quality . therefore, electrostatic analyses were performed thrice, using the ten clades models:  refined by scwrl,  refined by modrefiner and  not refined.

preliminary comparison at trimer and monomer level showed meaningful variation only at the ved-rbd subregion. in fact, direct comparison of stems did not allow for inferring any clade-specific signature as all clades were found to share - at both i = 0 mm and i = 150 mm - the typical isocontour of the h <dig> stem . moreover, apart from electrostatic differences in the ved-rbd subregion, no further meaningful variation was observed among ha <dig> isocontours. this prompted us to ‘zooming in’ variation analysis at the rbd subregion level.

figure  <dig> illustrates local charge variation in rbd isocontours among h5n <dig> clades. even though variation is more evident at i = 0 mm, meaningful difference is kept hence highlighted at physiological ionic strength. it is noteworthy that, independently on models are refined or not and on algorithm used for refinement, the same relevant local changes in rbd isopotential contours are found . early clades evolution is characterized by a charge shift event at the 220-loop: in the most ancient clade , the side chain of amino acid  <dig> shows either negative  or positive  charge. the positive charge is ‘fixed’ in the most recent, and still circulating clades  <dig>  and  <dig>  . further loss of a negative residue  concerns the ved isocontour at the 110-helix region. table  <dig> shows that in clade  <dig>  position  <dig> is negatively charged  or polar, non-charged . this negative charge is almost completely lost in clade  <dig> , while being retained  in clade 7; however, this latter clade shows ongoing loss of the negative charge at position  <dig> , that is positively charged in 100% of clade  <dig> and clade  <dig> sequences . in clades  <dig> and  <dig>  such ‘denegativization’ of the ved isocontour is somehow counterbalanced by negativization  at the properly receptorial part of the rbd. in clade  <dig>  this depends on asn140asp mutation  while in clade  <dig> both depositivization  and negativization  mutations are observed . intriguingly, when considering aforementioned replacements altogether, evolution of h5n <dig> still circulating clades seems having been characterized by an isocontour rearrangement based on a ved-to-rbd flow of negative charges; this process is ‘partial’ hence seemingly in progress in clade  <dig>  whereas it is complete and ‘fixed’  in clade  <dig>  given that comparison of the six different ha structures identified ha-specific variation in both electrostatic and hydropathy features, and that specific electrostatic signatures of the rbd could also be associated to the ten h5n <dig> clades, clades analysis was integrated by comparison of the rbd surface hydropathy profiles . as for electrostatic analysis, the most ancient clade  is the reference for tracking hydropathy profile variation along clades evolution. as previously explained, hereafter both real protein sequence numbering and  software output numbering is reported for reader’s convenience. clade  <dig> shows no substantial difference with respect to clade  <dig>  at least in terms of hydropathy plots. instead, clade  <dig> shows increased hydrophilicity at position asn <dig> . clade  <dig> shows increased hydrophobicity around position ser <dig> . replacement at position  <dig> of a polar residue in clade  <dig> by ile in all other clades results in increased hydrophobicity. intriguingly, the hydropathy profile of clade  <dig> resembles the one of h <dig> haemagglutinin, including its aforementioned three hydrophilicity peaks. please note that the apparent disagreement among positions of the three h <dig> peaks in figure  <dig> and those from clade  <dig> in figure  <dig> is not confirmed in real numbering, as plot shift is determined by ten extra residues present in the really n-terminal region of h <dig>  apart from difference illustrated so far for the rbd, no further meaningful variation was observed when comparing other ha <dig> subregions or the stem profiles .figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
evidence from this work shows that sequence homology is often, but not always, related to structural similarity and vice versa. in fact, in some instances, protein domains with less related sequences can show intriguing structural closeness. therefore, in order to obtain a more complete view of the ‘functional evolution’, phylogenetic analyses based on sequence comparison and resulting in trees, might be integrated taking into account information from structural comparison. dissimilarity in secondary structure elements does not always result in different antigenic properties. sometimes, secondary structure is not prominent to the molecule antigenicity. indeed, electrostatic features are crucial to interactions and in fact electrostatic profiles of the rbd subregion varies amongst different has. on the other hand, stems, ha <dig>  monomers and trimers topology appears to be variable. as shown by h <dig> and h <dig> modeled structures, electrostatic profiles seem to depend on ha type rather than organism source. hydrophobicity analysis reveals that local, ‘spot’ variation especially concerns the rbd subregion. no flow of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity is observed as for charge flow in the electrostatic analysis. in h5n <dig> clades comparison, from an electrostatic point of view, meaningful variation concerns only the ved-rbd subregion. intriguingly, a charge flow specifically concerns still circulating clades  <dig> and  <dig>  where ‘denegativization’ of the ved isocontour is counterbalanced by negativization in the rbd. it is noteworthy  that the same specific differences are found when comparing refined or not refined clade models or models refined using different algorithmic strategies . given that local charge concentration is typical for antigenic epitopes, it is tempting to speculate that charge redistribution in such clades might have contributed to antigenic escape hence to their evolutionary success and spreading. indeed, such an hypothesis is in agreement with evidence that charge redistribution on the rbd characterizes the two clades  which were able to spread over the largest geographical distribution and that, in particular, such redistribution is fixed in sequences from clade  <dig>  which is the world most spread clade. it is noteworthy that also variation in hydrophobic patches is especially observed in the rbd subregion.
