BACKGROUND
protein palmitoylation is the addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid primarily to cysteines via a thioester linkage   <cit> . this form of fatty acylation targets cytoplasmic proteins to membranes, but can also occur on transmembrane proteins where it often affects protein localization or stability  <cit> . identification and characterization of palmitoylated proteins has traditionally been encumbered because of insensitive detection methods, the lack of a consensus amino acid motif for bioinformatics prediction of palmitoylation sites, a lack of antibodies for detecting palmitoylation and challenges in detecting palmitoylated peptides with standard mass spectrometry techniques  <cit> . to overcome these difficulties, non-radioactive chemical tools and methodologies have been recently developed that are advancing the study of protein palmitoylation  <cit> . an analogue of palmitic acid possessing a terminal alkyne group  is incorporated by cells onto proteins at sites of palmitoylation  <cit> . the alkynyl group allows a targeted reaction with azide-functionalized detection tags via the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction commonly termed click chemistry . azido-rhodamine  is a detection tag that can be used for visualization, while azido-azo-biotin  allows selective retrieval of alk-16-labeled proteins using streptavidin-coated agarose  <cit> . we, and others, have previously used, and continue to apply these tools for enhancing our understanding of regulation of immune responses by lipid post-translational modifications   <cit> .figure  <dig>

of particular importance, the aforementioned chemical tools allowed the identification of palmitoylation-dependent antiviral activity of the interferon -induced transmembrane protein  <dig>   <cit> . in the present study, we performed an analysis of palmitoylated proteins in a murine antigen presenting dendritic cell line  in comparison with murine embryonic fibroblasts , both at steady state and after ifnα treatment. known lipidated and ifn-induced proteins, ifitm <dig>  bone marrow stromal antigen  <dig>  and immunity related gtpase m <dig> , were detected in both cell types after ifnα treatment. we also detected novel palmitoylated proteins expressed at steady state, and validated several of these proteins, including t-lymphocyte activation antigen cd <dig> and toll-like receptor  <dig>  in dendritic cells , and e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase nedd <dig> in mefs. given the complete novelty of the discovery of a lipid modification occurring on a member of the extensively studied tlr family, we chose to focus further on determining the effects of palmitoylation on tlr <dig> 

tlrs are critical for the cellular recognition of most pathogens  <cit> . their detection of microbial products results in activation of the transcription factor nf-κb and production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators of the immune response  <cit> . at least  <dig> human and  <dig> mouse tlrs have now been identified, which recognize distinct sets of pathogen-associated molecules  <cit> . tlr <dig> is expressed primarily on myelomonocytic cells including antigen presenting cells, such as dcs and macrophages  <cit> . tlr <dig> detects the widest range of microbial products among the tlrs, including lipomannan from mycobacteria, zymosan from yeast and bacterial lipopeptides typified by the pamcsk synthetic lipopeptides  <cit> . as such, tlr <dig> knockout mice and humans with deleterious tlr <dig> polymorphisms are more susceptible to multiple pathogens  <cit> . thus, tlr <dig> is a critical component of the innate immune system, and a better understanding of its post-translational regulation may prove useful in our defense against pathogenic organisms.

RESULTS
visualization of palmitoylated proteins in mefs and dc <dig>  cells
having made the previous discovery of the critical role of palmitoylation of ifitms in the innate antiviral immune response  <cit> , we sought to determine whether any additional ifn-induced proteins are regulated by palmitoylation. for our experiments, we chose to use murine antigen presenting cells  and mefs because these cell lines are responsive to type i ifns  <cit> , are amenable to labeling with the alk- <dig> reporter of protein palmitoylation  <cit>  and serve as a control for one another in that type i ifn should induce a similar set of proteins in both cell types. additionally, this analysis would provide a valuable comparison of the general palmitoylomes of two cell types  with unique functions. dc <dig>  cells and mefs were either left untreated or were treated with ifnα for four hours prior to metabolic labeling with alk- <dig> in the presence or absence of ifnα for an additional two hours. cell lysates were reacted with az-rho or az-biotin via click chemistry . az-rho-labeled proteins were separated by sds-page and visualized by fluorescence gel scanning . anti-ifitm <dig> and anti-gapdh blotting were used as controls for the activity of ifnα on these cells and for loading, respectively. the fluorescent profiles of the two cell types did not indicate that drastic changes to palmitoylation occur upon ifnα treatment. however, one specific band could be seen uniquely in the ifnα-treated samples, appearing at approximately 15 kda, potentially corresponding to the molecular weight of the ifitms .

mass spectrometric identification of palmitoylated proteins in mefs and dc <dig>  cells
given that differences induced by ifnα could possibly be masked by highly abundant proteins within the fluorescent palmitoylome profiles observed in figure 1b, we next utilized the fraction of our samples that had been reacted with az-biotin in order to affinity purify alk-16-labeled palmitoylated proteins using streptavidin-coated agarose. these purified proteins were separated by sds-page  and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. extracted peptides were then identified by tandem mass spectrometry  analysis and assigned to proteins using mascot software. after subtraction of proteins identified in the control lanes as described in the methods section and eliminating proteins with fewer than three spectral counts, a total of  <dig> proteins were identified from the dc <dig>  samples and  <dig> proteins were identified from the mef samples, indicating that there is a large difference in the repertoire of palmitoylated proteins expressed by these different cell types . of the proteins identified in dc <dig>  cells, 76% had been previously identified as palmitoylated proteins in our past analysis of this cell line, and by others in proteomic studies of other cell types  <cit>  . of the proteins identified in mefs, which had not been palmitoylome profiled before, 64% were previously reported to be palmitoylated, providing strong validation of our methodology .

analysis of several known palmitoylated proteins that were identified uniquely in only one of the two cell types would suggest that their differential detection is due to cell type-specific expression differences. for example, sortilin- <dig> , inducible nitric oxide synthase  and hla class ii histocompatibility antigen gamma chain  were uniquely detected in dc <dig>  cells, consistent with published data curated by biogps showing that murine dcs express these genes while mefs do not  <cit>  . conversely, catenin delta , flotillin- <dig> , gtpase hras and tyrosine-protein kinase yes were detected in mefs, but not in dcs , again corresponding to cell type-specific expression patterns  <cit> . further supporting the assertion that the observed differences in the proteins detected are not due to differences in the ability of the two cell types to palmitoylate different subsets of proteins, biogps was also utilized to examine the mef and dc expression patterns for the dhhc palmitoyltransferases , the enzyme family responsible for the majority of s-palmitoylation in cells  <cit> . indeed, murine mefs and dcs each express nearly all of the dhhcs, with the exception of dhhcs  <dig> and  <dig> which are testis-specific and dhhc <dig> which is brain-specific  <cit> .

bioinformatic classification of alk-16-labeled proteins commonly identified in both mefs and dc <dig>  cells
we identified  <dig> alk-16-labeled proteins that were common to both dc <dig>  cells and mefs , suggesting that these proteins may perform fundamental cellular functions. these included critical cellular proteins such as calnexin , gtpase nras and the cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor  . indeed, exploring the classification of these  <dig> proteins shows that proteins with enzymatic activity constituted 40% of the  <dig>  transporters and ion channels formed another 20%. an additional 37% constituted structural proteins and those in ubiquination and glycosolation processes, with the remaining 3% being cellular receptors and transcription regulators . enrichment analysis using ingenuity defined pathways recapitulated that palmitoylation is critical for a multitude of signaling pathways, including those downstream of ephrin receptors and integrins, as well as axonal guidance signaling . similarly, pathways centering on the cellular morphology-controlling small gtpases, rac <dig> and/or rhoa, involving multiple palmitoylated proteins were identified .

on a more global level, network analysis of the  <dig> shared palmitoylated proteins demonstrated that the myc proto-oncogene protein and the cellular tumor antigen p <dig> are upstream of  <dig>  of these proteins, which is more than would be expected by chance . several dhhcs have been discovered to be misregulated in various tumors, but their contribution to tumorigenesis is currently unclear  <cit> . palmitoylated myc and p <dig> effector proteins may offer candidates for future experiments determining the role of specific dhhcs and palmitoylated proteins in cancer progression. taken together, a multitude of coherent pathways are regulated by palmitoylation in both dcs and mefs, and these data add to our growing appreciation of the roles palmitoylation plays in regulating a myriad of basic cellular processes.

ifn-induced fatty acylated proteins
we also identified proteins present only in the ifnα-treated samples or that had peptide peak area measurements that were increased in the ifnα-treated samples by at least  <dig>  fold. since type i ifns generally induce a common set of antiviral proteins even in distinct cell types, we reasoned that true ifn-induced palmitoylated proteins should be present in the ms/ms results of both dc <dig>  cells and mefs. with this additional criterion, we were left with only three proteins enriched in the ifnα-treated samples in both cell types: ifitm <dig>  irgm <dig> and bst <dig>  also known as tetherin. indeed, each of these proteins is known to be ifn-inducible, and ifitm <dig> serves as a control since we expected to identify this protein based on our past work  <cit> . palmitoylation of irgm <dig> was verified in our laboratory , and was also recently reported to be important for its membrane localization and ability to affect mitochondria membrane dynamics  <cit> . interestingly, past palmitoylome profiling studies of murine t cells  <cit>  and human b cells  <cit>  also identified bst <dig> as a putative palmitoylated protein. although bst <dig> palmitoylation has not yet been validated by visualization methods, the study performed in murine t cells found that mass spectrometric detection of alk-16-labeled bst <dig> was diminished upon sample treatment with hydroxylamine, which cleaves thioester bonds characteristic of palmitoylation  <cit> . likewise, the work identifying bst <dig> in b cells utilized acyl-biotin exchange chemistry, which allows specific enrichment of s-acylated proteins  <cit> . bst <dig> is also well characterized to be lipidated with a gpi anchor  <cit> , which could incorporate long chain fatty acids such as alk- <dig>  although previous alk- <dig> proteomic profiling studies have not been significantly contaminated with gpi anchored proteins, arguing against this possibility  <cit> . mutation of individual residues within bst <dig> will be necessary to determine the precise location and type of lipidation reported by alk- <dig> labeling. nonetheless, our data confirm that the ifn-induced effector proteins, ifitm <dig>  irgm <dig> and bst <dig>  are each lipid-modified.

novel palmitoylated proteins identified in mefs and dc <dig>  cells
our work identified  <dig> proteins in mefs and  <dig> proteins in dc <dig>  cells that had not been previously reported to be palmitoylated in past proteomic studies . many of these proteins were found in only one of the two cell types. for example, we observed the e <dig> ubiquitin-protein ligase nedd <dig> specifically in mefs , and confirmed its palmitoylation, thereby identifying an entirely new modification with potential regulatory activity on this extensively studied and critically important protein  <cit>  . of particular interest to our laboratory were two proteins uniquely identified in dc <dig>  cells that are essential to immune responses, cd <dig> and tlr <dig>  cd <dig> is expressed on the surface of mature dcs and provides a costimulatory signal to t cells that is necessary for their proper activation  <cit> . we thus sought to confirm cd <dig> palmitoylation and map its site of modification. utilizing a c-terminally ha-tagged construct of murine cd <dig> , we were able to validate our ms/ms results by demonstrating robust labeling of cd86-ha with alk- <dig> . interestingly, palmitoylated cd86-ha was observed as multiple high mw bands indicating that its glycosylated forms are palmitoylated  <cit> , while its non-glycosylated form at the expected molecular weight of 35 kda was not modified, potentially suggesting sequential modification . mutation of cys- <dig> to ala at the cytoplasmic edge of the cd <dig> transmembrane domain resulted in a complete loss of alk- <dig> labeling, implicating cys- <dig> as the primary site of cd <dig> palmitoylation . cd <dig> has homology to, and a partially redundant function with, t-lymphocyte activation antigen cd <dig>  <cit> . we thus generated a cd80-ha construct and also confirmed its palmitoylation , thereby demonstrating a conservation of this ptm on the cd <dig> and cd <dig> costimulatory molecules.figure  <dig> 
confirmation of the s-palmitoylation of immunomodulatory proteins, cd <dig> and tlr <dig>  a-c) validation and mapping of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> palmitoylation. hek293t cells were transfected with the indicated cd86-ha , flag-tlr <dig> , or tlr2-yfp  constructs. transfected cells were labeled with  <dig> um alk- <dig> or dmso as a control for one hour. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for the respective epitope tag or fluorescent protein. immunoprecipitates were reacted with azido-rhodamine  for visualization of palmitoylation by fluorescent gel scanning. western blotting was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. d,e) overexpression screens to identifiy dhhcs capable of modifying cd86-ha and flag-tlr <dig>  hek293t cells were co-transfected with ha-tagged dhhcs  <dig> to  <dig> or gst as a control and either cd86-ha  or flag-tlr <dig> . immunoprecipitated proteins were treated and visualized as in a-c. western blotting was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. bar graphs represent average quantified fluorescence intensities from at least three identical experiments normalized to their respective western blots. values for cd <dig> or tlr <dig> co-transfected with gst control were set to  <dig>  dhhc constructs are labeled according to previously used dhhc nomenclature in order to be consistent with past studies using these constructs. importantly, dhhcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are the same in both the previous and modern nomenclature. note that in d, dhhc <dig> itself is visible in the fluorescent gel scan of this region. the expression levels of the individual dhhcs obtained in a representative experiment are shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  dmso, dimethyl sulfoxide; tlr <dig> toll-like receptor  <dig> 



we similarly confirmed tlr <dig> palmitoylation utilizing a previously generated construct in which the human tlr <dig> er signal sequence was replaced by an artificial signal sequence followed by a flag epitope tag  <cit> . indeed, flag-tlr <dig> was readily labeled by alk- <dig> . two cytoplasmic-facing cysteines within tlr <dig>  cys- <dig> and cys- <dig>  were predicted by the css-palm version  <dig>  palmitoylation site prediction program  <cit>  to be highly probable sites of palmitoylation. generating cys to ala mutations at these positions and at the nearby cys- <dig> allowed for the demonstration that palmitoylation is lost only when cys- <dig> is mutated . thus, while bioinformatic methods may provide candidate sites of modification, the study of protein palmitoylation requires empirical validation. we further confirmed that cys- <dig> is the primary site of human tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation using a tlr <dig> construct with its natural er signal sequence and a c-terminal yfp tag  <cit>  , and also verified that murine tlr <dig> is s-palmitoylated on the same residue .

to determine the extent to which palmitoylation is conserved on tlrs other than tlr <dig>  we tested a panel of human tlrs  <dig> to  <dig> for alk- <dig> labeling in hek293t cells. while the expression levels of the different tlrs varied, tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> clearly showed palmitoylation signals above background bands . interestingly, tlr <dig>  which physically interacts with tlr <dig> and has been associated with regulating tlr <dig> responses , had the strongest palmitoylation signal relative to its total protein level . these findings reveal that palmitoylation is at least partially conserved on a subset of the human tlrs. these data also confirm that palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins occurs with specificity that is not currently predictable by sequence analysis or by homology with known palmitoylated proteins.

palmitoylation of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> can be increased by specific dhhcs
in order to examine whether or not s-palmitoylation of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> could be installed by specific dhhcs, we performed overexpression screens of each of the dhhcs with cd <dig> and tlr <dig>  this method is commonly used to identify dhhcs capable of modifying individual protein substrates  <cit> . cd86-ha s-palmitoylation was increased by dhhcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . flag-tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation was similarly enhanced by the dhhcs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . since the palmitoylation sites of cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are both at the cytoplasmic edge of their respective transmembrane domains, this may suggest that this subset of dhhcs is particularly adept at modifying cysteines adjacent to membranes. however, unlike cd <dig>  palmitoylation of tlr <dig> was also increased by dhhc <dig>  demonstrating substrate specificity for individual dhhcs . overall, these experiments further validate that cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are s-palmitoylated proteins whose modification can be mediated enzymatically by specific dhhcs.

palmitoylation is required for complete activation of nf-κb by tlr2
given our laboratory’s focus on innate immunity, we chose to further investigate the effects of s-palmitoylation on the activity of tlr <dig> in primary cultured dcs. for these experiments, we utilized a commonly used covalent inhibitor of dhhcs, 2-bromopalmitate   <cit> . we found that 2-bp treatment of murine bone marrow-derived  dcs resulted in a loss of the endogenous tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation signal . concomitantly, 2-bp-treated bmdcs lost the ability to produce high levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il- <dig> and tnfα in response to pam3csk <dig> and lipomannan, which are microbe-based ligands specifically detected by tlr <dig> . since prolonged exposure to 2-bp can result in off-target effects and cellular toxicity  <cit> , we also employed sendai virus, a tlr-independent activator of cytoplasmic rig-i-like receptors, as a control  <cit> . sendai virus induced high levels of il- <dig> and tnfα secretion even in the presence of 2-bp , indicating that the effects of 2-bp were largely specific to the tlr <dig> pathway . additionally, we did not observe overt cellular toxicity upon 2-bp treatment in the time period examined, as judged by trypan blue exclusion. treatment with 2-bp also inhibited lipomannan-induced il- <dig> and tnfα secretion from primary human monocyte-derived dcs . thus, the inhibition of cellular palmitoylation by 2-bp leads to an impaired tlr2-dependent proinflammatory cytokine response by dcs.figure  <dig> 
tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation is necessary for nf-kb-dependent gene induction and cytokine production in response to tlr <dig> microbial ligands. a) tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation is inhibited by 2-bp in bmdcs. cells were treated with  <dig> um 2-bp or an equivalent volume of dmso for eight hours prior to labeling for one hour with  <dig> um alk- <dig>  tlr <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and reacted with az-rho for fluorescence visualization of palmitoylation. western blotting with anti-tlr <dig> antibodies was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. b) cytokine secretion in reponse to tlr <dig> ligands is inhibited by 2-bp in bmdcs. cells were treated with  <dig> um 2-bp or an equivalent volume of dmso for eight hours. tlr <dig> ligands, pam3csk <dig>  or lipomannan , or sendai virus  , were added to the cellular media for an additional six hours. il- <dig> and tnfα levels in cellular supernatants were measured by elisa. results in a,b are representative of three experiments. error bars in b are the standard deviation of triplicate samples. c) palmitoylation-deficient tlr <dig> is less able than wt to induce nf-κb-dependent gene expression in response to microbial ligands. hek293t cells were co-transfected with the indicated plasmids along with a reporter construct expressing nf-κb-driven firefly luciferase and a plasmid constitutively expressing renilla luciferase for normalization. cells were mock treated or treated for eight hours with pam3csk <dig> , lipomannan  or zymosan , and luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates. results are presented as fold induction over mock treated samples. d) western blots confirming similar expression of tlr2-yfp and tlr2-c609a-yfp in experiments performed in c. results in c, d are representative of at least five experiments. error bars in c represent standard deviation of triplicate samples. *p < <dig>  by student’s t-test. az-rho, azido-rhodamne; bmdcs, bone marrow dendritic cells; dmso dimethyl sulfoxide; tlr, toll-like receptor; 2-bp, 2-bromopalmitate.



we next measured the ability of tlr2-yfp and tlr2-c609a-yfp to stimulate nf-κb-dependent gene expression in response to microbial ligands. tlr2-c609a-yfp was significantly less able than tlr2-yfp to induce nf-κb-dependent luciferase production in response to pam3csk <dig>  lipomannan and zymosan . levels of wt and mutant tlr <dig> were comparable in these experiments as measured by western blotting . similar results demonstrating a defect in the induction of nf-κb-dependent luciferase activity by the palmitoylation-deficient tlr2-c609a mutant were also obtained when utilizing flag-tagged constructs, and further demonstrated that this decrease in activity is specific for mutation of the cys- <dig> palmitoylation site since a cys- <dig> to ala mutant possessed activity similar to wt flag-tlr <dig> . in sum, our data demonstrate that the tlr <dig> cys-609 s-palmitoylation site is required for proper activation of nf-κb in response to microbial ligands.

s-pamitoylation of tlr <dig> promotes its cell surface localization
we next examined the effect of endogenous tlr <dig> ligation on its s-palmitoylation status. we observed that tlr <dig> palmitoylation is decreased upon stimulation of murine bmdcs with lipomannan . this palmitoylation decrease correlates with a decrease in tlr <dig> surface staining, while surface staining of costimulatory molecules and mhc ii increased as expected for activated dcs . this finding is also consistent with past observations of tlr <dig> downregulation at the cell surface upon binding of its ligands  <cit> . the correlation between decreased tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation and decreased cell surface levels suggested that, perhaps, s-palmitoylation affects tlr <dig> localization. indeed, inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-bp decreased endogenous tlr <dig> surface staining of bmdcs, while overall cellular levels of tlr <dig> remained similar . in accord with these results, overexpressed murine flag-tlr2-c609a showed a subtle, but reproducible, decrease in cell surface staining when compared to wt flag-tlr <dig> , with their mean fluorescence intensities differing by approximately 25% on average . importantly, achieving robust cell surface staining of flag-tlr <dig> constructs required transfection of five to ten times more dna than was required for activity assays, perhaps suggesting that the forced overexpression of the wt and c609a tlr <dig> constructs results in underestimation of their cell surface differences. we further confirmed that overall protein levels and the stability of tlr <dig> are not affected by palmitoylation by performing pulse-chase analysis of flag-tlr <dig> and flag-tlr2-c609a, which demonstrated that the decay of the wt and mutant proteins was similar . overall, we conclude that s-palmitoylation positively regulates tlr <dig> activity, at least in part, by promoting its trafficking to the cell surface.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
the development of chemical proteomic methods to identify palmitoylated proteins has led to a tremendous increase in our appreciation of the numerous ways in which palmitoylation regulates key cellular processes and can control cell type-specific pathways  <cit> . we previously reported the identification of  <dig> palmitoylated proteins in dc <dig>  cells that included proteins critical to antiviral immune responses  <cit> . however, the absence of several expected palmitoylated proteins from our ms/ms identification led us to hypothesize that additional unknown palmitoylated proteins also remained to be identified in this cell type  <cit> . indeed, refinements to our palmitoylated protein enrichment protocol that included increased incubation time with streptavidin agarose and repeated washing steps, along with updates to our mass spectrometry capabilities, have led to a deeper coverage of the dc <dig>  palmitoylome . in comparison to the palmitoylome of mefs, we identified novel putative palmitoylated proteins that play a role in the immune functions of dcs. following up on several of these proteins, we were able to validate palmitoylation of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> costimulatory molecules  as well as tlr <dig> . interestingly, our proteomic results indicated that mefs express a wider diversity of palmitoylated proteins than dcs , and include many proteins, such as nedd <dig>  that should lead to exciting follow up studies.

our discovery of cd <dig>  cd <dig> and tlr <dig> palmitoylation in dcs reveals novel mechanisms of immune regulation, and underscores the value of examining palmitoylation in diverse cells types. cd <dig> and cd <dig> are essential for immune responses to most pathogens as well as for elimination of tumor cells by the immune system  <cit> . these costimulatory molecules provide a second signal for t-cell activation in addition to mhc/peptide complexes presented on the surface of mature dcs  <cit> . future studies will aim to determine whether palmitoylation is involved in the trafficking of these molecules to the dc surface, their subsequent clustering at the immunological synapse and their impact on immune function.

here, we specifically followed up on the role of s-palmitoylation in regulating tlr <dig> activity. indeed, the response to all microbial ligands of tlr <dig> that were tested was decreased in the absence of tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation, indicating that this lipid modification is a positive regulator of tlr <dig> activity . s-palmitoylation is necessary for complete localization of tlr <dig> at the cell surface, and thus likely affects its interactions with its ligands . while an effect of palmitoylation on the cell surface expression of multiple other proteins has been previously reported  <cit> , it is interesting to note that although cd <dig> and tlr <dig> are both s-palmitoylated at membrane-proximal cysteines  by a similar subset of dhhcs , their cell surface localization is inversely regulated during dc activation . this reinforces the commonly observed theme that palmitoylation can have unpredictable effects depending on the protein context in which it occurs  <cit> . future analyses of how s-palmitoylation of additional immune receptors controls their localization, interactions and signaling will be an exciting area of future study, as will the examination of potential subversion of tlr <dig> s-palmitoylation by pathogens. importantly, the identification of s-palmitoylation of tlrs suggests that this reversible form of protein lipidation  <cit>  may be targeted in the future to manipulate beneficial and non-beneficial tlr2-mediated immune responses.
