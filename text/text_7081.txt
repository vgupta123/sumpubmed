BACKGROUND
shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  are members of a category of pathogenic e. coli that can cause illness ranging from mild intestinal diarrheal disease to severe kidney complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome . cases and outbreaks of stec have been associated with the consumption of contaminated food and water. although more than  <dig> serogroups have been implicated, the major outbreaks are linked to a very small number of serotypes . in  <dig>  an uncommon strain of pathogenic e. coli serotype o104:h <dig> caused an unusual number of gastroenteritis and hus cases, occurring predominantly in adults. the strain originated in northern germany and disseminated to other european countries  <cit> . the outbreak was originally thought to have been caused by a stec strain, but was later shown to be produced as a result of an enteroaggregative e. coli  strain that had acquired the genes for production of shiga toxins  <cit> .

the eaec category is heterogeneous, and it is associated with cases of acute or persistent diarrhea in children and adults worldwide . the virulence of eaec is known to require a variety of virulence factors. the mechanism by which eaec exerts pathogenesis; however, is thus far poorly characterized since eaec strains are recovered from healthy as well as diseased subjects . eaec strains are recognized by their characteristic aggregative or "stacked-brick" adherence pattern and their ability to form biofilms. it has been proposed that host cellular changes during eaec infection results in digestive-absorptive abnormalities, prolonging the diarrhea  <cit> . the ability of eaec to obtain essential nutrients during this process and multiply successfully in this environment is crucial. eaec, like most bacteria, must acquire iron to survive, since the inability to acquire this metal will disrupt biofilm formation properties and eaec interaction with human epithelial cells  <cit> . therefore, eaec strains attempting to establish an infection must have the ability to scavenge iron and multiply within the host environment as fundamental requirements for the disease onset.

a wide variety of strategies for acquiring iron have been developed by pathogenic e. coli, the most common being the production of siderophores and the utilization of heme  <cit> . okeke et al. showed that the most prevalent iron acquisition-encoding genes found in clinical eaec isolates corresponded to those involved in the synthesis of siderophores, such as in the case of aerobactin  <cit> . furthermore, this study found an association between geographical variation of the eaec strains and their iron utilization genes with disease onset, indicating that most eaec strains contain more than one iron transport system  <cit> . there is an urgent need to characterize additional virulence factors in e. coli o104:h <dig>  besides the shiga toxins, which might be associated with disease in the natural setting and not just in silico or in vitro. therefore, we combined a murine model that mimics the enteropathogenicity of e. coli strains  <cit>  with bioluminescent imaging  technology, a method recently optimized in our laboratory  <cit> . we hypothesized that the murine model of experimental infection using e. coli o104:h <dig> bacteria not only is an appropriate way to visualize the site of intestinal colonization, but will also aid in rapid screening of putative virulence factors in vivo. this bli infection method provided us with the advantage of quantitatively assessing the e. coli o104:h <dig> burden and facilitated the development of new insights into tissue tropism during infection. furthermore, bli application reduced the number of animals required for competition experiments, aided in the localization of e. coli o104:h <dig> infection sites, and enabled us to quickly screen the role of the aerobactin iron transport system  as a virulence factor in this pathogen.

RESULTS
in vivo bioluminescence imaging
the e. coli o104:h <dig> lux strain rjc <dig> was generated as described in methods. we used the pcm <dig> plasmid containing the lux operon under the ompc constitutive promoter. this plasmid was used for the following properties: to avoid the exogenous addition of luciferase substrate, it carries both a two-plasmid partitioning system and a post-segregational killing mechanism, and maintenance can be ensured for at least 7 days  <cit> . e. coli o104:h <dig> transformants were plated on the appropriate media, incubated at 37 °c, and monitored for bioluminescence. colonies that did not display any apparent difference in the bioluminescent signal after patching on plates containing the appropriate antibiotic were further evaluated for their resistance to multiple antibiotics , presence of multiple plasmids, and growth phenotype similar to that of the wild-type strain . e. coli strain rcj <dig> was selected because it displayed wild-type characteristics and showed a strong bioluminescence signal.

e. coli o104:h <dig> lux strain rjc <dig> was evaluated as a reporter strain in following intestinal infection of the icr  mouse model. a group of  <dig> icr mice were infected intragastrically with  <dig> x  <dig> cfus of e. coli strain rjc <dig> . every  <dig> hours, the animals were anesthetized and monitored for bioluminescent signal by using the ivis spectrum, which collected and quantified the photons emitted by the e. coli o104:h <dig> lux infecting the animals. three animals were sacrificed every  <dig> hours , and intestines were harvested for ex vivo imaging. over the course of the study, the bioluminescence signal increased in whole animals, peaking at 24 h and eventually decreasing with time . the bioluminescent signal was significantly reduced when the intestines were imaged ex vivo; however, it was evident that bacteria colonize the murine cecum and persist there throughout the various time points . a bioluminescent signal was undetectable at 168 h  post infection. intestinal cecum sections from different time points were homogenized and plated on lb agar containing kanamycin to determine whether the reporter strain remained in the intestine or was eliminated with time. we recovered  <dig>  x 106 ±  <dig>  x  <dig> ,  <dig>  x 107 ±  <dig>  x  <dig> ,  <dig>  x 107 ±  <dig>  x  <dig> , and  <dig>  x 103 ±  <dig>  x  <dig>  cfus of strain rjc <dig>  confirming that colonization of the intestinal cecum occurred within 3 days of infection, and lower numbers of bacteria were recovered after 7 days. in our previous work, we reported that the threshold of bioluminescent detection is likely in the range of  <dig> x  <dig> -  <dig> x  <dig> bacteria  <cit> ; therefore, the low numbers of the reporter strain recovered at 7 days explained the absence of the signal.

histological characterization and electron microscopical analysis
we used the remainder of the cecum sections for histological and ultrastructural evaluation. tissues were processed and examined by electron microscopy to determine whether infection with e. coli o104:h <dig> damaged intestinal epithelial cells. as shown in figure 1c, bacteria were present in e. coli o104:h4-only infected tissues at all time points. although, no close interaction with the epithelia was observed, destruction of the microvilli and cell death were detected in the sections analyzed at 48 h and 72 h post infection. macroscopically, the pathological damage of the intestinal wall at these time points was depicted as bleeding upon contact. in contrast, no changes to tissue integrity were observed at 24 h post infection. at 7 days, integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier recovered, despite an increase in the number of luminal bacteria. the bacteria appeared clustered and surrounded by extracellular matrices of unknown composition, an interesting feature observed at 72 h post infection .

histological examination of the h&e-stained infected tissues also revealed scattered inflammatory infiltrates in the submucosa at  <dig> and 48 h. inflammatory infiltrates rarely extended to the mucosa and the muscularis. with the exception of rare foci showing residual necrosis and inflammation, the sections collected at 72 h and at 7 days appeared mostly unremarkable .

aerobactin receptor expression is induced on macconkey agar
we have previously demonstrated that expression of novel putative virulence factors, such as the locus for diffuse adherence in atypical enteropathogenic e. coli <cit>  or the enterotoxigenic e. coli afimbrial adhesion locus , are induced when bacteria are grown on macconkey agar at 37 °c. furthermore, it is shown that if these factors are expressed on the bacterial surface, a simple extraction method using heat is sufficient in isolating the protein that can then be submitted for sequencing  <cit> . therefore, we investigated proteins expressed differentially on macconkey compared to lb agar in  <dig> e. coli o104:h <dig> strains: our prototype german e. coli o104:h <dig> isolate c <dig> and  <dig> e. coli o104:h <dig>  recovered from an outbreak in the republic of georgia. coomassie-stained sds-page gel comparison of the heat-extracted protein profiles of the  <dig> e. coli o104:h <dig> grown in lb and macconkey agar revealed one protein in all  <dig> strains with an apparent molecular weight of ~80 kda when samples were grown on macconkey agar . a second protein of ~55 kda was also expressed in the e. coli o104:h <dig> strain  <dig> . in contrast, these two proteins were absent from the crude heat-extracts of the  <dig> e. coli o104:h <dig> strains grown in lb agar alone. both proteins were submitted for maldi-tof analysis and identified as the ferric aerobactin receptor  and the e. coli chain a, dipeptide-binding protein . the ferric aerobactin transport system is a well-known virulence factor in e. coli strains causing extraintestinal infections , such as urinary tract infections  <cit> . although its role as a virulence determinant in intestinal e. coli is not well understood, it has been proposed that it contributes to the strong colonizing capacity of those strains carrying the aerobactin genes  <cit> . for this reason, we evaluated the contribution of this iron transport system in the colonization capabilities of e. coli o104:h <dig> 

low iron concentration in macconkey induces aerobactin receptor expression
macconkey agar is considered a low iron-containing medium which has been used to identify high-affinity iron and zinc uptake systems  <cit> . therefore, expression of the aerobactin receptor in the e. coli o104:h <dig> wild type and the iuta mutant was investigated by using heat-extracted preparations of bacteria grown on agar plates with and without the addition of the iron chelator  <dig> ’-dipyridyl . expression was monitored on macconkey as well as lb agar supplemented with dp, because the addition of the iron chelator is known to induce expression of iron transport systems in e. coli <cit> . no production of iuta  was observed on coomassie-stained  <dig> % sds-page gels containing lb agar-recovered bacterial extracts, while abundant iuta was evident in samples from macconkey plates . in contrast, the iuta mutant lacked detectable expression of iuta on either media tested. to confirm that aerobactin receptor expression responded to iron depletion, the media was supplemented with 200 μm of dp. as shown in figure  <dig>  panel a, iron chelation resulted in the expression of iuta in bacteria grown on lb + dp as well as macconkey + dp. as expected, the aerobactin receptor was absent in heat extracts obtained from the css <dig> strain  grown on either of the iron-depleted media. however, for reasons that remain unclear, the expression of the iuta receptor does not appear to be further induced on macconkey agar supplemented with dp.

quantitative real-time pcr was performed to support the results obtained with the heat-extracted proteins and to quantify the expression of iuta in the e. coli o104:h <dig> wild-type strain, while grown in lb or macconkey media with and without dp. basal expression of iuta in the wild-type strain was set at a value of  <dig>  and all other values of expression were related to this baseline. the expression of iuta was  <dig> -fold higher in the wild-type strain grown in macconkey as compared to lb . in the presence of dp, the iuta expression level in the wild-type strain increased  when grown in lb + dp and reached  <dig> -fold when the wild-type strain was grown on macconkey agar supplemented with dp . overall, data confirmed that the aerobactin receptor is expressed on the surface of e. coli o104:h <dig> wild-type strain, while grown on macconkey agar, and that expression increased in response to iron depletion.

contribution of aerobactin to intestinal colonization
given that the aerobactin transport system has been proposed as a contributor to the strong intestinal colonizing capability of some strains  <cit> , the influence of the mutation of this iron transport system in e. coli o104:h <dig> intestinal colonization in mice was assessed. in a wild-type background, deletion of iuta aerobactin receptor gene had a significant effect upon colonization of the cecum . starting at 24 h post-infection, the wild-type strain outcompeted the iuta mutant ; ), suggesting that aerobactin production makes a contribution to colonization early during infection. consistent with the results at 24 h, the cis of the iuta mutant at 48 h , 72 h , 96 h , and 168 h , were drastically diminished as compared to the wild-type strain. data suggested that the in vivo intestinal colonization of the e. coli o104:h <dig> strain required the aerobactin transport system, and the defects observed were due to the inability of the strain to acquire iron.

discussion
shiga toxin-producing e. coli o104:h <dig> is a recently identified emerging pathogen that caused an outbreak resulting in a large number of hus cases and fatalities in adults. although the serotype o104:h <dig> was previously isolated in  <dig> from a child presenting hus  <cit>  and in  <dig> from a woman who contracted hus in korea  <cit> , the unprecedented number of cases, lethality, and complications resulting from the infection identifies this strain as a public threat to human health. the intestinal disease that arises from the e. coli o104:h <dig> causing the outbreak seems to be the result of a hybrid infection that developed from recombination of the shiga toxin genes from stec o157:h <dig> into an eaec strain, which became evident after sequencing the genome of this isolate  <cit> . despite the extensive body of literature available regarding stec and eaec infections and the study of the pathogenic mechanisms, no data are available on the virulence mechanisms of hybrid strains, as in the case of e. coli o104:h <dig>  data collected by our group and others demonstrated that in vivo bioluminescence imaging is a valuable tool for providing insights into mechanisms of pathogenesis, with the goal of identifying new virulence or colonization properties  <cit> . in the current study, it was demonstrated that e. coli o104:h <dig> infection in the streptomycin-treated mouse colonization model can be monitored by using rjc <dig>  a bioluminescent strain of e. coli o104:h <dig> 

bli has been used to study the mechanisms of pathogenesis and treatment efficacies for a number of infectious enteric bacteria. one of the first investigations using bli was conducted to monitor the virulence differences among strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . in that study, the authors showed the utility of the bioluminescence system by visualizing the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in infected animals. bli in e. coli has also been used to track eaec colonization in the streptomycin-treated mouse intestine  <cit> , and the study proposed that the bli system offers a simple and direct method to study in vitro and in vivo competition between mutants and parental strain. furthermore, the streptomycin-treated mouse colonization model was previously used to investigate the role of other iron uptake systems  in e. coli k <dig>  <cit> , and it was demonstrated that iron is an essential source for e. coli growth in the murine intestine. it is well known that the maintenance of intestinal colonization requires many properties, among which metabolic competence is of the utmost importance. therefore, when two strains are in competition for a limited nutrient, like iron, the one that is able to use it more efficiently should outcompete the other  <cit> . for this purpose, we combined the power of bli with in vivo murine competition experiments to demonstrate that the aerobactin transport system is required for colonization of e. coli o104:h <dig> 

the aerobactin transport system is a well-established virulence factor in extra-intestinal e. coli infections, but the role of this siderophore system during intestinal infection by pathogenic e. coli strains has never been fully established. however, several lines of evidence suggest that this iron transport system might be an important virulence factor for some intestinal pathogenic e. coli. a previous epidemiological study performed by our group to identify the distribution of iron utilization genes in collections of eaec strains isolated during case control studies in nigeria and brazil, indicated that the aerobactin transport system is present in >75% of the strains analyzed  <cit> . interestingly, a significant association was found between the aerobactin transport and the heme transport systems with more strains from cases than from controls in the nigerian collection  <cit> . a recent study has also investigated whether virulence determinants, commonly present in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli, are associated with the fitness of e. coli strains in the infant bowel microbiota  <cit> . the authors found that accumulation of specific sets of virulence markers, including aerobactin and fimbrial adhesin genes in each individual strain  <cit> , correlated positively with its time of persistence in the colon of infant patients. therefore, they proposed that some bacterial traits contributing to extra-intestinal infections have evolved to increase the fitness of e. coli in the intestine  <cit> . interestingly, e. coli strains that persist and are considered members of the commensal flora can become pathogenic under the appropriate inflammatory conditions in the intestine  <cit> . for example, members of a newly classified group known as adherent and invasive e. coli  are commonly found in ileal lesions of crohn's disease patients, and they represent isolates that do not have the classical virulence factors found in other e. coli pathotypes. recent studies trying to identify those virulence determinants in aiec that might contribute to the initiation or persistence of cd indicated that the genome of aiec strains is closely related to those e. coli strains causing extraintestinal infections  <cit> . interestingly, all of the aiec genomes sequenced today possess the aerobactin genes, and it was also demonstrated that iron uptake mediated by the aerobactin system is important for aiec intracellular survival and mouse intestinal colonization  <cit> . overall, the data point to the possibility that the aerobactin transport system participates in the maintenance of the bacteria within the anaerobic environment of the gut. therefore, this iron transport system in e. coli o104:h <dig> becomes an important “fitness” determinant, as in the utilization of ferric iron, it confers a competitive advantage to this and other pathogenic bacteria over those organisms that do not possess this transport system.

although the mouse model does not accurately reflect the intestinal infection or complications seen in humans infected with eaec, stec or e. coli o104:h <dig>  it still remains a relatively practical way to investigate the pathogenesis of e. coli strains, especially when compared to more resource-consuming animal models of eaec/stec infection, such as the gnotobiotic piglet  <cit>  and the rabbit  <cit> . previous studies have shown that an eaec o104:h <dig> strain 55989str can colonize the streptomycin-treated mouse gut extensively for at least 3 weeks  <cit> . even though no sign of disease was evident in the infected animals, the same model was recently used to study the replication of three bacteriophages specific for an eaec o104:h <dig> strain, and the mouse intestinal samples enabled the investigators to examine the long-term dynamic interactions between bacteriophages and bacteria within a mammalian host  <cit> . in the case of stec, the mouse model has been developed and used to monitor stec disease and pathology, as well as the impact of stx in the promotion of intestinal colonization  <cit> . in our case, the incorporation of bli analysis proved a useful tool in facilitating the development of an e. coli o104:h <dig> pathogenesis model, as it significantly reduced the number of animals required to identify the intestinal site of e. coli o104:h <dig> persistence and colonization. although the lux-encoded plasmid system that we utilized failed to monitor the infection beyond 7 days and the signal decreased significantly with ex vivo intestines, as previously reported  <cit> , it proved to be a useful way of quantifying colonization of this strain while lacking experimental information about putative pathogenic genes. currently, we are improving our reporter e. coli o104:h <dig> strain by mobilizing a constitutively expressed lux operon into its chromosome, providing a stable system that can be used to monitor intestinal colonization and persistence properties for an extended period of time.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings demonstrate that bioluminescent imaging is a useful tool to monitor e. coli o104:h <dig> colonization properties and present the murine model as a rapid means of evaluating the bacterial factors associated with fitness and/or colonization during e. coli o104:h <dig> infections.
