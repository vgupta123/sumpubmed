BACKGROUND
the olfactory system plays a key role in various insect behaviours, such as those related to locating suitable hosts, avoiding predators, identifying oviposition sites, and finding sexual partners  <cit> . the antennae are crucial olfactory organs in this system, and many studies have demonstrated that the system generally involves two main steps. firstly, odorants penetrate the sensillar lymph through pores, wherein they are recognised and bound by odorant-binding proteins   or chemosensory proteins   <cit> . secondly, it was speculated that the obps or csps were the transporters that transferred odorants through the sensillar lymph to a family of integral membrane protein, the olfactory receptors , located on the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons  . additionally, sensory neuron membrane proteins   <cit>  and ionotropic receptors   have also been proposed to play a role in insect olfaction.

to thoroughly explore the mechanisms of insect olfaction, tissue or sex expression profiling as well as functional analyses of candidate chemosensory genes are the primary important steps that should be performed. compared with initial techniques such as gene cloning with degenerate primers and rapid amplification of cdna ends  , rna-seq is considered to be a timesaving, cost effective, and highly efficient method. therefore, large-scale studies identifying chemosensory genes have been undertaken with distinct insects whose genomes have not been sequenced in recent years, such as ips typographus   <cit> , dendroctonus ponderosae   <cit> , dendroctonus valens   <cit> , anomala corpulenta   <cit> , sesamia inferens   <cit> , and helicoverpa armigera   <cit> .

to date, many chemosensory genes have been identified from insects of almost every insect order. however, their exact functions are largely unknown, as these genes were identified based on sequence similarity to previously reported genes. examination of gene expression profiles, particularly the tissue or sex distribution, and phylogenetic analyses could potentially provide important information concerning the function of chemosensory genes .

the cabbage beetle, colaphellus bowringi baly , is a serious insect pest and widely distributed in china as well as some other asian countries. it primarily feeds on the developing leaves of cruciferous vegetables such as raphanus sativus, brassica chinensis, b. pekinensis and b. campestris, and aestivates and hibernates in the soil during the adult stage  <cit> . there are two distinct infestation peaks annually: one in spring with a single generation and a second in autumn involving three generations. both sexes copulate an average of five times per day , and 15-dayold partners have significantly greater mating success in mate choice than other developmental stages  <cit> . however, highly effective sex attractants and pesticides to control the pest are not available  <cit> .

in this study, we performed a transcriptome analysis of adult antennae of c. bowringi, and identified  <dig> candidate chemosensory genes comprising  <dig> obps,  <dig> csps,  <dig> snmps,  <dig> ors,  <dig> irs, and  <dig> grs. furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive and comparative phylogenetic analysis and examined or gene transcription patterns using quantitative real-time rt-pcr . the results clearly revealed a unique feature of sex-biased expression of some ors, and ultimately allowed us to identify potential targets to disrupt odorant perception in c. bowringi that could lead to new pest management techniques.

RESULTS
transcriptome sequencing and sequence assembly
we carried out next-generation sequencing on a cdna library constructed from the adult antennae of c. bowringi using the illumina hiseq™  <dig> platform. the transcriptome sequence consisted of approximately  <dig> million clean reads . after clustering and redundancy filtering, we identified  <dig>  unigenes with an n <dig> length of 1510 bp . we called these  <dig> sequences unigenses, although each might not necessarily represent a unique gene. of the  <dig>  unigenes, those with a sequence length greater than 500 bp accounted for  <dig>  % of the transcriptome assembly .table  <dig> summary of c. bowringi transcriptome assembly



homology analysis and gene ontology  annotation
among the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>  were matched by a blastx similarity of the entries in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database, with a cut-off e-value of 10− <dig>  the highest match percentage  was to tribolium castaneum  sequences followed by dendroctonus ponderosae , acyrthosiphon pisum  , diaphorina citri   and bombyx mori   .

gene ontology  annotation was used to classify transcripts into functional groups according to the go category. of the  <dig>  unigenes,  <dig>   could be annotated based on sequence similarity. in the molecular function category, the genes expressed in the antenna were mostly associated with binding, catalytic, and transporter activities. in the biological process category, cellular, metabolic, and single-organism processes were the most represented. in the cellular component category, cell, cell part, and organelle were the most abundant groups .

identification of candidate chemosensory genes
by similarity analysis, a total of  <dig> transcripts belonging to gene families putatively involved in insect chemoreception were identified, including obps , csps , snmps , ors , irs  and grs  . compared with insects where the chemosensory genes had been identified by analyzing either the genome or transcriptome, the number of candidate chemosensory genes identified here in c. bowringi was similar to those in d. ponderosae  and more than i. typographus , but less than in t. castaneum  .table  <dig> the blastx match of c. bowringi candidate obps, csps and snmps genes

obps
we identified  <dig> different transcripts encoding candidate obps in c. bowringi, which is less than that in d. ponderosae , but more than that in i. typographus , a. corpulenta , and d. valens . the results of the sequence analysis revealed  <dig> transcripts with a full-length open reading frame  with predicted signal peptide sequences, and cbowobp <dig>   <dig>   <dig> corresponded to a partial sequence that encoded amino acids from  <dig> to  <dig>  except for cbowobp <dig>  the other  <dig> cbowobps identified were similar to known coleopteran obps . among the  <dig> cbowobps, cbowobp <dig> showed the highest expression level  

a phylogenetic tree of the obps was constructed using the protein sequences from c. bowringi, t. castaneum, d. ponderosae, i. typographus, a. corpulenta, and drosophila melanogaster  . as previous reports  and our results,  <dig> full-length cbowobps could be divided into three groups: minus-c obps , plus-c obps , and the remainder classic obps.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of insect obp. the c. bowringi translated genes are shown in blue. amino acid sequences used for the tree are given in additional file 6: table s <dig>  bootstrap values greater than 50 % are shown. the plus-c subfamily is marked in blue, and the minus-c subfamily is marked in red



csps
in total,  <dig> different transcripts encoding candidate csps with four conserved cysteine profiles were obtained in c. bowringi through bioinformatic analysis, which included  <dig> sequences predicted to be full length and  <dig> with a signal peptide , with cbowcsp <dig> harbouring the highest expression level  . the phylogenetic tree revealed two branches with high bootstrap values: cbowcsp <dig> with tcascsp <dig> and dponcsp <dig>  and finally cbowcsp <dig> with agamcsp <dig>  bmorcsp <dig>  and bmorcsp <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of insect csp. the c. bowringi translated genes are shown in blue. amino acid sequences used for the tree are given in additional file 6: table s <dig>  bootstrap values greater than 50 % are shown



snmps
four snmp homologs with full-length orfs were also obtained from the c. bowringi transcriptome. this number is consistent with d. valens, but is greater than that in other previously studied coleoptera insects . the blastx results demonstrated that cbowsnmps encoding proteins harboured a 42–59 % identity to those of other reported insects . the rpkm results showed that cbowsnmps displayed the highest expression level  . based on the phylogenetic analysis, we found that cbowsnmp1a and cbowsnmp1b clustered with the coleoptera snmp <dig> group, while cbowsnmp <dig> and cbowsnmp <dig> clustered with high support with dponsnmp <dig> and itypsnmp2fix, respectively .

ors
forty-three different transcripts for candidate ors were identified based on the antennal transcriptome data for c. bowringi, among which  <dig> sequences contained a full-length orf that encoded  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. we identified one or sequence that shared a high level of identity with the conserved orco proteins of other insect species and labelled it cboworco. the amino-acid sequence of cboworco shared 92 % identity with the co-receptor of ambrostoma quadriimpressum  . more than 80 % of the cbowors were highly divergent, and had low levels of identity  with other reported insect ors. based on prediction and comparison with other insect ors  <cit> , we found full-length cbowors had  <dig> to  <dig> tmd  .

a phylogenetic analysis was conducted using a data set containing the sequences of the  <dig> ors longer than  <dig> amino acids in c. bowringi and  <dig> ors from four other coleopteran species . the or sequences were clustered into several subgroups according to previous studies. cbowors were only present within the previously defined coleopteran or subgroups  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> as well as the orco subgroup. we found that  <dig> cbowors  and a functionally characterized mcaror <dig>  <cit>  were clustered in subgroup  <dig>  a total of <dig> cbowors  and  <dig> functionally characterized mcarors   <cit>  belong to subgroup  <dig> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of insect or. the c. bowringi translated genes are shown in blue. amino acid sequences used for the tree are given in additional file 6: table s <dig>  bootstrap values greater than 50 % are shown



the transcriptional profiles of cbowor genes were characterized using qpcr, and the results revealed that all of the  <dig> cbowors displayed predominately antenna linked or otherwise biased expression levels. although we did not identify apparent sex-specific genes in these c. bowringi olfactory receptors, there were six  and <dig>  with significantly higher expression in the male and female antennae, respectively .fig.  <dig> relative expression levels of all ors in adult antennae and whole body, using qpcr. fa, female antennae; ma, male antennae; bo, whole insect body . the relative expression level is indicated as mean ± se . different capital letters mean significant difference between tissues 



irs and grs
in total, we identified nine ir and ten gr candidates in c. bowringi, which is similar to that reported in other recent antennal transcriptomic studies of coleoptera insects  <cit>  . only four of these likely represented a full-length orf , among which we also found three tmds. the rpkm results showed that cbowir <dig>  and cbowgr <dig>  displayed the highest expression levels . according to the phylogenetic tree of the irs from d. melanogaster and various coleopterans, we observed all nine cbowirs were clustered into antennal irs and ir25a/ir8a clades .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of insect ir. the c. bowringi translated genes are shown in blue. amino acid sequences used for the tree are given in additional file 6: table s <dig>  bootstrap values greater than 50 % are shown



discussion
compared to dipterans and lepidopterans, the molecular basis of chemoreception in coleopterans is relatively poorly understood. in the current study, we sequenced and analyzed the transcriptome of antennae from c. bowringi. among the  <dig>  unigenes identified, only  <dig>  % gene translations shared significant similarity with entries in the ncbi non-redundant  protein database, and only  <dig>  % could be annotated to one or more go term, which is similar to that reported in other coleopteran species , indicating that a large number of c. bowringi genes are non-coding or homologous to genes that do not have any go term, or perhaps some are c. bowringi-specific or fast-evolving genes. importantly, we identified  <dig> novel chemosensory genes in c. bowringi. our results not only establish a means to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chemosensation, but also provide insight into insect physiology and the development of additional pest control strategies  <cit> .

the total number  of chemosensory transcripts identified in c. bowringi is different from what has been reported in d. ponderosae  and i. typographus , this phenomenon may be due to the evolution of divergent physiological behaviours  of different insects during the process of adaptation to various environments . specific environments might lead to divergent evolutionary trajectories of the same ancestral chemosensory genes, resulting in different functional genes among species.

in total,  <dig> obps were identified in the antennal transcriptome of c. bowringi. this is close to the number of obps in the antennae of d. ponderosae  and d. valens , however less than in t. castaneum . the number of cbowcsps  is similar to d. ponderosae  while less than t. castaneum . previous studies showed that some insect obps and csps are expressed primarily or exclusively in non-antennae tissues or in larvae , thus we may not have obtained these types of genes.

currently, the general mechanism of insect snmp function is still poorly understood. while dmelsnmp <dig> is essential for the detection of the pheromone -11-octadecenyl acetate  in d. melanogaster, and it is thought that snmp acts in concert with odorant receptors to capture pheromone molecules on the surface of olfactory dendrites  <cit> . in this study, snmp transcripts were identified in c. bowringi  and were found to be more numerous than those in the t. castaneum genome . the expression of antennal snmps in c. bowringi, similar to what was previously reported for other known coleopteran insects, suggests that snmps in coleopteran insects may have same role as in d. melanogaster.

in comparison with the lepidopterans, although the coleopterans ors have been focused on in recent years , species richness and function analyses are still lacking. for this reason, it is necessary to identify additional coleopteran ors to further elucidate the mechanisms of coleopteran chemosensation. in insects, gene duplications and deletion events may be the major contributors to high levels of diversity in or genes and variability in gene number among species. forty-three ors were first identified in the antennal transcriptome of c. bowringi, which is less than the number of ors in the complete genome of t. castaneum . however, it is same as the number of ors identified in the antennal transcriptome of i. typographus  and a. corpulenta , suggesting we may missed some larvae-biased ors or those with lower expression levels. remarkably, similar to what has been observed in t. castaneum, m. caryae, and a. corpulenta, a species-specific expansion of ors  was also found in c. bowringi, which may reflect that these distinct species inhabit different ecological niches. m. caryae was the first beetle in which the function of the ors was characterized  <cit> . for this reason, we are only able to speculate on the possible functions of cbowors by examining those of the orthologous mcarors. mcaror <dig> can bind the pheromone component -2-methyl-1-butanol and additional structurally related chemicals using functional analysis in vitro. cbowor <dig> displayed a male-biased transcriptional profile characteristic and could be clustered into the same subgroup with mcaror <dig>  indicating that it may have a similar function to mcaror <dig> as well as other lepidopteran pheromone receptors  . in total, we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes with significantly higher expression levels in male and female antennae, respectively. based on previous studies of the insect or functions , the male-biased cbowors may be involved in the detection of the sex pheromone or other male-specific behaviours, while female-biased cbowors may detect odours critical to female behaviour, such as oviposition cues or male-produced courtship pheromones. the sex-specific functions of these cbowors need to be further investigated in the future.

furthermore, we identified  <dig> irs from the antennal transcriptome assembly in c. bowringi, which is fewer than that in t. castaneum  and d. ponderosae . this may be due to the possibility that some transcripts were missing from our antennal transcriptome. like orco, both ir8a and ir25a were thought to act as co-receptors since they are co-expressed along with other irs  <cit> . sequence alignments and the phylogenetic tree revealed that cbowir8a and cbowir <dig>  belong to the co-expression ir group. to date, multiple grs have also been identified in different insect species . while only ten cbowgrs were found in c. bowringi, this was expected since grs are primarily expressed in gustatory organs, such as the proboscis and maxillary palps, rather than the antennae .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we identified an extensive set of candidate genes that may be related to odorant perception of c. bowringi by analyzing transcriptomic sequence data. as the first step towards understanding gene functions, we conducted a comprehensive and comparative phylogenetic analysis and examined or gene transcription patterns, some of which were sex-biased. further analysis is needed to explore the function of these genes using integrated functional studies.
