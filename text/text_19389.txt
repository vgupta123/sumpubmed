BACKGROUND
arachidonic acid can be converted to leukotrienes which mediate inflammatory and immunological reactions  <cit> . the key enzyme in leukotriene biosynthesis is 5-lipoxygenase , which upon activation and interaction with 5-lo activating protein  converts arachidonic acid, via a two step process, to leukotriene  a <dig>  this compound can easily be transformed into ltb <dig>  through the action of lta <dig> hydrolase, or into ltc <dig>  catalyzed by ltc <dig> synthase  <cit> . leukotriene c <dig> can be further converted to ltd <dig> and lte <dig>  the biological effects of leukotrienes are dependent on receptor interaction  <cit> . leukotriene b <dig> is a potent chemotactic mediator for granulocytes and t lymphocytes  <cit> . several reports have demonstrated a function of ltb <dig> in the immune system as a stimulator of monocytes, t lymphocytes and b lymphocytes  <cit> .

biosynthesis of leukotrienes is restricted to a few cell types in the human body. myeloid cells are the main source of leukotriene formation but b lymphocytes have also the capacity to produce ltb <dig>  the activation of leukotriene synthesis in b cells is quite different in comparison to myeloid cells. neutrophils and monocytes readily produce leukotrienes upon stimulation with calcium ionophore a <dig>  b cells, however, do not produce ltb <dig> after challenge with calcium ionophore only but the cells can produce similar amounts of ltb <dig> as myeloid cells after changing the cellular oxidative status  <cit> . the 5-lo activity in b cells appears to be latent and the mechanism of activation of the enzyme under physiological conditions is not yet known. endogenously produced ltb <dig>  however, plays a pivotal role in cd40-dependent activation of chronic b lymphocytic leukaemia cells   <cit> .

in resting neutrophils, 5-lo is localized in the cytoplasm but upon cell activation the enzyme translocates to the nucleus and nuclear membranes  <cit> . it has been proposed that this translocation allows for 5-lo to interact with flap on the nuclear membrane, thus enabling leukotriene synthesis  <cit> . the localization of 5-lo seems, however, to differ between different types of myeloid cells  <cit> . phosphorylation of 5-lo appears to influence the nuclear import of 5-lo  <cit> . in b cell lines and isolated b cells in vitro, both cytoplasmic and nuclear localisation of 5-lo have been reported  <cit> .

mantle cell lymphoma  constitutes 5% of non-hodgkin lymphomas. most mcl carry the t translocation by which cyclin d <dig> becomes overexpressed  <cit> . most mcl have unmutated immunoglobulin genes  <cit>  and the current hypothesis is that the tumour cells are derived from the mantle or marginal zone of the b cell follicles. microarray data of mcl have revealed high expression of 5-lo in these cells in comparison to control lymphoid tissue  <cit> .

the enzyme 5-lo has been reported to be expressed in precursor b cells, b cell populations from the peripheral blood, tonsils and various types of malignant b cells  <cit> . however, it is not known which particular subsets of b lymphocytes from the tonsils which can express 5-lo and produce ltb <dig>  therefore, in order to define the function of the leukotriene pathway in b cells, we investigated the cellular expression of 5-lo in different tonsillary subsets of b lymphocytes and the corresponding type of malignant b cell lymphoma.

RESULTS
pcr analysis of genes involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes in subsets of b cells
rt-pcr was performed on isolated total rna from subsets of tonsillary b cells to elucidate the gene expression of enzymes involved in the leukotriene cascade. these analyses demonstrated that 5-lo, flap and lta <dig> hydrolase were expressed in various degrees in tonsillary b cells , memory b cells , mantle zone b cells  and germinal centre  b cells . highest relative expression of these three genes was found in mantle zone b cells and lowest expression in gc b cells . these results indicate differential expression of these enzymes in subpopulations of b cells. no investigated subpopulation of b cells expressed ltc <dig> synthase.

western blot analysis of 5-lo expression in subsets of b cells
subpopulations of b cells from tonsils were separated by flow cytometry and analyzed by western blot in order to further characterize the expression of 5-lo. whole cell lysates of purified cells were submitted to sds/page followed by western blotting using a polyclonal anti-human 5-lo antibody. a single immunoreactive band at the expected size was observed in the sample consisting of total b cells  from tonsils, mantle zone b cells  and in memory b cells  and a weak band was detected in gc b cells  . in contrast, no band was detected in samples from plasma cells . there was a more marked difference in the expression of the 5-lo protein than in the 5-lo mrna levels in the various subtypes of b cells .

immunofluorescence analysis of 5-lo expression in subsets of tonsillar b lymphocytes
to identify the expression of 5-lo protein in subpopulations of tissue tonsillar b cells, a panel of antibodies were used to identify mantle zone b cells , germinal centre b cells  and plasma cells . figure 3a shows high expression of 5-lo in mantle zone b cells . in contrast, a very weak expression of 5-lo was observed in gc cells  . figure 3c demonstrates no expression of 5-lo in plasma cells  within the gc. furthermore, no expression of 5-lo was observed in plasma cells  outside the gc . these results concur with the western blot analysis of 5-lo in different subsets of b cells .

immunohistochemical analysis of 5-lo expression in mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma
in order to further characterize the expression of 5-lo in subsets of b cells, we investigated the expression of 5-lo in malignant cells derived from the mantle zone and the germinal centre i.e. mantle b cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. for comparison, lymph node biopsies were obtained from patients with reactive lymph nodes. in agreement with the data shown in figure  <dig>  the expression of 5-lo in a reactive lymph node was mainly found in b cells from the mantle zone rather than from the germinal centre . interestingly, virtually all b cells expressed 5-lo in a biopsy obtained from a patient with mcl . in contrast, corresponding analyses of biopsies from patients with follicular lymphoma, demonstrated that very few cells expressed 5-lo. these cells are most likely dendritic cells or tangible body macrophages as described earlier  <cit>  . no staining was observed with control antibody . similar results were obtained with another 5-lo antiserum . taken together, all investigated biopsies from patients with mantle zone b cell lymphoma clearly expressed 5-lo, whereas, little or none staining was observed in biopsies from patients with follicular lymphoma .

5-lo protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. samples of reactive lymphoid tissue  and tonsil, ), mantle cell lymphoma , classic and blastoid variants  and follicular lymphoma , malignancy grades 1-3a  were collected in a tissue microarray and simultaneously stained. the age and the sex of the patients are indicated. expression of 5-lo in lymphoma cells was semiquantified in four levels; absence of staining in tumor cells , weak staining , moderate staining  and strong staining  as compared to cells in reactive mantle zones that were moderately positive. n.a. = not applicable

as a comparison, tonsillar polymorphonuclear granulocytes expressed 5-lo in the nucleus , in contrast to tonsillar cd <dig> positive t lymphocytes which did not express 5-lo . the ihc in figure 4g was stained with human anti-cd <dig> antibody.

biosynthesis of ltb <dig> in mantle b cell lymphoma
since it was difficult to isolate large numbers of tonsillary non-malignant mantle zone b cells for chemical analysis, we used mcl cells to study the biosynthesis of ltb <dig> in mantle zone b cells. for this purpose, we used both different mcl cell lines and primary mcl cells isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with leukemized mcl, so called prolymphocytic leukemia  with t. b-pll is in fact a heterogenous disease and those cases that are positive for cyclin d <dig> and carry the t translocation are in the current who classification of malignant lymphomas  <cit>  considered to be leukemic forms of mcl  <cit> . all three investigated mcl cell lines  expressed 5-lo protein . figure  <dig> depicts the capacity of b-pll cells and mcl cell lines to produce leukotrienes. the challenge of b-pll cells with ionophore a <dig> plus arachidonic acid and the thiol-active compound diamide led to the formation of similar amounts of ltb <dig> as produced by human neutrophils   <cit> . this cocktail of compounds is known to induce ltb <dig> production in other types of b lymphocytes  <cit> . sonicated cells also readily produced ltb <dig> . upon calcium ionophore activation only, isolated b-pll produced low amounts of ltb <dig> , showing that there were minimal amounts of myeloid cells contaminating these preparations of b-pll cells. figure 6b shows that intact or sonicated granta  <dig>  jeko- <dig> and rec <dig> cells also produced significant amounts of ltb <dig> as b-pll cells. the capacity of the different cell lines to produce ltb <dig> correlated relatively well with the degree of expression of 5-lo protein . in essence, these results demonstrate that both b-pll cells and mcl cell lines have the capacity to produce ltb <dig> and that the cells contained substantial amounts of 5-lo, which could be activated under certain conditions.

discussion
the activation mechanisms and biological functions of 5-lo in human b lymphocytes are unclear although the overall capacity of b cells to produce ltb <dig> is similar to myeloid cells  <cit> . we purified various subpopulations of tonsillary b cells and investigated the expression of enzymes involved in the leukotriene pathway. rt-pcr and western blot analysis of b cells from tonsils separated by flow cytometry showed high expression of 5-lo, in particular mantle zone b cells but also memory b cells , while germinal centre cells and plasma cells showed low or no expression of 5-lo, respectively. this analysis also demonstrated that flap and lta <dig> hydrolase were expressed in these various b cell populations . in order to further investigate the expression of the 5-lo protein, immunofluorescence analyses of tonsillary tissue b cells were performed. a distinct expression of 5-lo was seen in igd+ b cells in the mantle zone, while only a weak expression was found in germinal centre b cells and virtually no expression in plasma cells .

to verify if the expression of 5-lo was preserved in malignant b cells we investigated mcl and fl. mantle cell lymphomas have a lower somatic mutation rate in immunoglobulin genes than follicular lymphomas and approximately 60–75% of mantle cell lymphomas have immunoglobulin genes in germ-line configuration. therefore, it has been hypothesized that mantle cell lymphomas are derived from naïve cells, similar to normal mantle zone b cells  <cit> . immunohistochemical analysis of biopsies from mcl patients showed high expression of 5-lo in virtually all cells . follicular lymphomas, on the other hand, have a high rate of somatic mutations in immunoglobulin genes and clearly originate from germinal centre b cells  <cit> . there were no or low expression of 5-lo in follicular lymphoma cells and this concur with the results of normal germinal centre b cells .

there are conflicting data about the expression of 5-lo in t cells. we have previously reported that t cells express flap but not 5-lo  <cit> , whereas, one other report indicates the formation of ltb <dig> by human t cells  <cit> . we found no evidence for the expression of 5-lo protein in cd <dig> positive tonsillar t cells .

since the numbers of tonsillary mantle zone b cells that can be obtained by flow cytometry cell sorting is limited, we investigated the capacity to produce ltb <dig> in primary b-pll cells and cell lines derived from patients with mcl. three different mcl cell lines were used in this study and all were found to express 5-lo and to have the capacity to produce ltb <dig> . also, primary b-pll cells produced ltb <dig> in amounts similar to that of myeloid cells. primary mcl/b-pll cells and mcl cell lines produced ltb <dig> after being challenged with calcium ionophore plus arachidonic acid and diamide but not after stimulation with calcium ionophore only, showing that the mechanism of activation of the leukotriene pathway in mcl cells is similar to other investigated b cells  <cit> .

this study and earlier reports demonstrate that 5-lo is expressed in peripheral b cells, igd+ b cells in the mantle zone, memory b cells and in various malignant b cells, e.g. cd10+ acute pre-b-lymphocytic cells, chronic b-lymphocytic leukaemia, b-pll and mcl  <cit> . investigated b lymphocytes that do not express 5-lo are germinal centre derived b cells, plasma cells and cd10- acute pre-b-lymphocytic cells. the question if and under which conditions b lymphocytes can release ltb <dig> in vivo, is still unclear. in fact, it is possible that the role of the 5-lo pathway is quite different in b cells than in myeloid cells, and that the pathway has only an endogenous function in b cells which do not release and export ltb <dig>  thus, in b cells, 5-lo and ltb <dig> might only have a role at the level of the nucleus. however, the physiological conditions required for activation of the 5-lo pathway in b cells and biosynthesis of ltb <dig> have not yet been uncovered. in this regard, the cellular oxidative status of the cells seems to be of importance  <cit> . our finding that the enzyme is highly expressed in mantle zone b cells and less expressed in germinal centre b cells and not expressed in plasma cells could indicate that the enzyme might be activated in the lymph node to attract activated t cells. it is known that activated t cells express blt <dig>  the ltb <dig> receptor, and that ltb <dig> is a potent chemotactic agent for t cells  <cit> . therefore, we will now study the effect of t- and b lymphocyte interaction on the activity and expression of 5-lo.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study demonstrates high expression of 5-lo mantle zone b cells but not in germinal centre b cells or plasma cells indicating a role of the 5-lo pathway in b cells before the cells differentiate to plasma cells.
