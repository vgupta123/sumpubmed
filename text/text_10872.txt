BACKGROUND
studying changes in α2-adrenoceptor  signaling is important for understanding the development and/or manifestation for several cns  and pns disorders . under physiological conditions, norepinephrine and epinephrine  activate the α2-ar along with other members of the ar family, which also includes α1- and β-ars. the α2- and β-ars are often co-expressed on the same cell surface. upon activation by ne and epi, the independent signals initiated by the α2- and β-ars often converge to regulate specific physiological endpoints such as insulin release  <cit> , maintenance of uterine smooth muscle tone  <cit> , and noradrenergic transmission in the cns and pns  <cit> . the α2- and β-ars regulate many of these physiological mechanisms by mediating opposing actions on adenylyl cyclase; α2-ar inhibits while β-ar stimulates the adenylyl cyclase pathway.

continuous exposure to catecholamines leads to a declining receptor response, a phenomenon called desensitization. the process of desensitization generally includes receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation. unlike other members of the ar family, the α2a-ar subtype does not readily down-regulate. since this subtype is the dominant α2-ar in the cns and mediates the "classical effects" of α2-ars which include hypotension, sedation, and antinociception  <cit> , numerous studies have focused on the regulatory mechanisms of the α2a-ar. in cultured cell lines expressing either native α2a-ar  <cit>  or recombinantly over-expressed α2a-ar  <cit> , supra-physiological concentrations of epi  and ne  were required to produce long-term α2a-ar desensitization. the waning α2a-ar signal is attributed primarily to down-regulation of the receptor and/or phosphorylation of the agonist occupied receptor by g-protein coupled receptor kinases , specifically grk <dig> and grk <dig>  <cit> . previous studies suggest that either of these two α2a-ar desensitization mechanisms require supra-physiological  concentrations of agonist  <cit> .

however, our recent studies in the be-c human neuroblastoma cell line suggest that when β-ars are present on the same cells lower, more physiologically relevant, concentrations of epi  are able to desensitize the α2a-ar following chronic  treatment  <cit> . in the absence of β-ars, α2a-ar desensitization occurs only with supra-physiological concentrations of epi, if it occurs at all  <cit> . concurrent activation of the β-ar and α2a-ar also prompts down-regulation of cell surface α2a-ars while specifically up-regulating the expression of grk <dig> within be-c cells  <cit> . enhanced grk <dig> expression plays a prominent role, as it is required for both β-ar-dependent α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation  <cit> . recently we reported similar findings for the α2b-ar subtype in mouse neuroblastoma cells  <cit> .

since both α2- and β-ars are often co-localized and share the same endogenous ligands, it is reasonable that the α2a-ar response is regulated differently in the presence and absence of the β-ar. indeed, evidence suggests that the α2-ar responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epi or ne vary, depending on the β-ar activity present there  <cit> . the aim of the present study is to compare α2a-ar responsiveness after chronic epi and ne treatment in non-β-ar expressing  human neuronal cells to α2a-ar responsiveness in sh-sy5y cells that have been stably transfected to express β2-ar . in doing so, we hope to determine whether co-expression of the two ars intrinsically produced this differential α2a-ar regulation and whether enhanced expression of grk <dig> is required for this regulation.

RESULTS
characterization of the model system and establishment of the shβ2ar <dig> cell line
our first goal was to find a second model system that was similar to the be-c human neuroblastoma cell line , but that didn't express β-ars. kazmi and mishra previously identified the sh-sy5y cell line as expressing two α2-ar binding sites  <cit> , while parsley et al. <cit>  reported that it expressed a single ar subtype, α2c, based upon functional and molecular studies. since receptor expression varies depending on differentiation state and passage number, it was necessary to determine which α2-ar subtypes were expressed in our population of sh-sy5y cells, using a combination of binding, functional, and molecular approaches.

sh-sy5y cells expressed α2-ar levels slightly greater than the level detectable in be-c cells -c,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol/mg protein). according to nonlinear and linear regression analysis of saturation binding, the data best fit a single-site model in sh-sy5y cells, as observed previously in be-c cells. rauwolscine and yohimbine competed for specific rauwolscine binding to sh-sy5y cell membranes with higher affinity than prazosin, the α2b/c-selective antagonist . apparent ki values of agonists and antagonists against rauwolscine binding were determined for comparison with previously reported values in cells natively expressing α2a-, α2b, or α2c-ars -c, ng108- <dig>  ok;  <cit> ) or cell lines expressing cloned α2c <dig>  α2c <dig>  and α2c <dig>  <cit> . values obtained from binding studies in sh-sy5y cells correlated only to values from be-c cells and showed the greatest similarity with those derived from native and cloned α2a-ar-containing cell membranes . these results are consistent with binding of rauwolscine to an α2a-ar in sh-sy5y cells.

binding inhibition and camp accumulation studies were performed as described in methods. the values of the apparent affinity constants log for each competitor were derived from their ic <dig> values  using the equation of cheng and prusoff  <cit> . the log values  were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis of the agonist concentration-response curves  of each agonist. avalues from kazmi and mishra  <cit> . n.d., not determined; n.a., not applicable.

correlation coefficient values  were generated by comparing pki values from table  <dig> with previously published values for one-site models using pearson correlation analysis . the slope of the linear regression line is also included. correlations were considered significant  if p ≤  <dig> .

functional studies were performed by measuring the ability of various α2-ar agonists to inhibit forskolin -stimulated camp accumulation in intact cells. all α2-ar agonists inhibited forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner; no stimulation of camp accumulation was noted in the absence of forskolin. inhibition of camp accumulation by the α2-ar agonist uk <dig>   was completely reversed by  <dig> nm yohimbine, whereas the α2b/c-selective antagonist arc- <dig>  at a concentration over 30-fold higher than that of the agonist, failed to reverse the actions of uk <dig> . thus, both binding and functional data support the classification of the α2-ar subtype in this neuroblastoma cell line as α2a.

since parsley et al. <cit>  were unable to detect α2a-ar rna by performing rt-pcr with total rna extract, we optimized our chances for detecting α2a-ar rna by generating rt-pcr products from sh-sy5y mrna using primer pairs selective for individual α2-ar subtypes  or a primer pair that recognizes two α2-ar receptor subtypes distinguished by their restriction nuclease digestion products . rt-pcr with α2c10/c <dig> primers gave a  <dig> bp product specific for α2a- and α2c-ars; restriction digestion of this fragment with bglii, that would specifically cleave α2a-ar, resulted in two fragments of  <dig> bp and thereby established expression of α2a-ar mrna in sh-sy5y cells. rt-pcr with α2c <dig> primers gave a  <dig> bp fragment, which was successfully digested by bstxi to produce three fragments of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> bp, consistent with the presence of an α2c-ar gene product . rt-pcr products were neither noted in samples lacking reverse transcriptase , nor were they produced with primers selective for α2c <dig> . while sh-sy5y cells express mrna for both α2a- and α2c-ars, it appears that the predominant functional α2-ar in our cell line is the α2a-ar.

since these cells appear to express α2a-ars with properties similar to those in be-c cells  <cit>  but lack a β-ar, pcdna  <dig>  plasmid vector containing the human β2-ar gene was transfected into sh-sy5y cells. colonies of stable transfectants were selected and maintained by their resistance to g <dig>  and subsequently clonal populations of β2-ar-expressing sh-sy5y cells  were screened for β-ar expression using cgp- <dig> for binding studies as described in methods. since be-c cells express very low levels of β2-ar , the shβ2ar <dig> cell line that expressed  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol/mg protein of the β2-ar was selected for the subsequent studies. to ensure that the β-ars were functional, the ability of isoproteranol  to stimulate camp accumulation was assessed . the α2a-ar responses were also tested in this new cell line to confirm that α2a-ar function had not been altered by the expression of the β2-ar .

chronic  <dig> nm epi exposure induces α2a-ar desensitization only in sh-sy5y cells transfected with functional β-ar
to determine whether the presence of the β-ar influences α2a-ar signaling, the ability uk <dig>  to inhibit forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation was evaluated after wildtype  and shβ2ar <dig> cells were exposed to vehicle or the indicated concentration of agonist for 16– <dig> hr. wt sh-sy5y cells  require a 30-fold higher concentration of ne  to desensitize the α2a-ar signal than shβ2ar <dig> cells . both the potency :  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) and efficacy :  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig>  fig. 3a) of uk <dig>  were reduced by  <dig> μm ne compared to vehicle treatment in wt cells ; modest concentrations of ne  and epi  are insufficient to alter the α2a-ar signal in the wt sh-sy5y cell line. in contrast, chronic treatment of the β-ar-expressing shβ2ar <dig> cells with  <dig> nm epi desensitized the α2a-ar signal causing loss of uk <dig>  potency : vehicle  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; epi  <dig>  ±  <dig> ) and efficacy : vehicle  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; epi  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; fig. 3b). unlike epi, which co-activates both ars, ne, at the concentrations employed activates only α2a-ars and does not alter α2a-ar signaling. we concluded that the difference in α2-ar signaling following epi treatment between the transfected and wt sh-sy5y was attributable to the presence of functional β2-ars, respectively. to ensure that the vector was not responsible for the observed difference between the wt and shβ2ar <dig> cells, similar experiments were conducted in sh-sy5y cells transfected with the vector alone . these vector only-expressing clones responded to epi  and ne  pretreatments as the parent sh-sy5y cells did .

to validate the importance of the β2-ar in the desensitization of the α2-ar signal, we included the β-ar selective antagonist propranolol  with the chronic  <dig> nm epi treatment. addition of propranolol blocks epi-induced α2a-ar desensitization resulting in uk <dig>  concentration-response curves indistinguishable from control  for epi + prop  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; imax  for epi + prop  <dig>  ±  <dig> ; p <  <dig> ; fig. 3d). propranolol treatment alone did not alter uk <dig>  potency or efficacy.

β2-ar signal is desensitized following exposure to  <dig> nm epi
to ensure that the β2-ar is functioning properly following catecholamine treatment, we evaluated the ability of iso to stimulate camp accumulation over basal in shβ2ar <dig> cells. the β2-ar signal is desensitized following chronic epi but not ne treatment, consistent with the fact that ne has a low affinity for the β2-ar. inclusion of propranolol  inhibited epi-induced β2-ar desensitization , but had no effect in the absence of epi.

chronic epi-induces down-regulation of the α2a-ar in shβ2ar <dig>  but not wt sh-sy5y cells
our study in be-c cells suggests that β2-ar-induced α2a-ar desensitization following long-term epi exposure is due in part to down-regulation of the α2-ars. to determine if the same mechanism is responsible for the epi-induced α2a-ar desensitization in shβ2ar <dig> cells, changes in α2a-ar expression following catecholamine treatment were evaluated. specific binding was measured with a single concentration of radioligand. we, and others, have shown that this is sufficient for accurate assessment of changes in receptor number for the α2a-ar  <cit> . chronic exposure of shβ2ar <dig> cells to  <dig> nm epi down-regulates the α2a-ars by 20% . the α2a-ar down-regulation in this cell line, as in be-c cells, requires β2-ar co-activation since loss of α2a-ars is prevented when  <dig> nm propranolol is included with epi. down-regulation of the α2a-ar is not observed following chronic activation of α2a-ar alone by  <dig> μm ne. further,  <dig> nm epi does not alter the expression of α2a-ar in wt sh-sy5y cells as compared to vehicle-treated cells  consistent with a lack of α2a-ar desensitization. hence, it can be concluded that chronic epi treatment induces a loss of α2a-ar response via β2-ar-dependent down-regulation of α2a-ars in shβ2ar <dig>  but not in wt sh-sy5y cells.

chronic epi exposure does not alter grk <dig> or grk <dig> levels in whole cells but instead enhances grk <dig> and grk <dig> expression at the membrane in shβ2ar <dig> cells
we previously established that epi-induced α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation in be-c cells is mediated via β2-ar-dependent grk <dig> up-regulation  <cit> . therefore, grk <dig> levels in whole cell shβ2ar <dig> lysates were evaluated following  <dig> hr catecholamine treatments. chronic epi exposure altered neither grk <dig> nor grk <dig> levels in the transfected sh-sy5y cell line . therefore, unlike results in be-c cells, increases in whole cell grk <dig> levels do not contribute to the modest α2a-ar desensitization or down-regulation observed in the shβ2ar <dig> cells.

shβ2ar <dig> cells were treated with vehicle , epi , propranolol, epi + propranolol, or  <dig> μm ne for  <dig> hr. approximately  <dig> μg of whole cell lysate from each treatment group was resolved by sds-page through a 10% gel. immunoreactive bands were normalized to the gapdh loading control and the grk/gapdh ratio was calculated.* data represent % of expression levels noted in vehicle-treated cells ; number of independent determinations is given in parentheses following the values.

although grk <dig> levels in whole cell lysates remain unaltered in shβ2ar <dig> cells, it is not known whether grk <dig> recruitment to the membrane is regulated via chronic epi treatment in that cell line. since grk <dig> and grk <dig> have been shown to regulate α2a-ar signaling  <cit> , we wanted to determine whether the membrane recruitment of either grk isoform was changed following chronic epi exposure in shβ2ar <dig> cells. grk <dig> and grk <dig> are cytosolic proteins that anchor to the membrane via interaction with free gβγ subunits; thus both kinases translocate from the cytosol to the membrane to regulate receptor signaling upon activation. taking this characteristic of grk <dig> and grk <dig> into account, the levels of both kinases in membrane fractions following chronic epi exposure were evaluated. shβ2ar <dig> cells exhibit an increase in membrane-associated grk <dig> and grk <dig> with  <dig> hr epi treatment compared to vehicle . in shβ2ar <dig> cells, the same propranolol concentration  that inhibited epi-induced α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation also attenuated epi-induced increase in grk <dig> and grk <dig> content in the membrane fraction . in contrast, no increased translocation of grks by epi treatment was observed in wt sh-sy5y cells that do not express β2-ars. therefore, this increased grk <dig> and grk <dig> translocation to the membrane following prolonged epi treatment in shβ2ar <dig> cells is β2-ar dependent.

discussion
the major finding of the present study is the confirmation  that sensitivity of α2a-ar to desensitization following exposure to relatively low levels of epinephrine is significantly increased in cells expressing both α2a- and β2-ar. the first evidence for this was recently reported in a human neuronal cell line endogenously expressing α2a- and β2-ars. alpha2a- and β-ars in be-c cells desensitized after chronic epi , but not ne , treatment  <cit> . interestingly, the α2a-ar responsiveness in sh-sy5y cells  is not desensitized after chronic treatment with  <dig> nm epi or  <dig> μm ne .

obviously, the difference in α2-ar sensitivity to lower concentrations of epi could be due to several factors, including differences in the α2-ar subtypes expressed in each cell line. since it is difficult to demonstrate with great certainty what α2-ar subtypes are present in a given cell or tissue by biochemical or pharmacological means only, we took a molecular approach to ascertain which subtypes might potentially be expressed based on the presence of mrna encoding each subtype. sh-sy5y cells contained mrna for α2a- and α2c-ars . as we noted and as reported by others  <cit> , no evidence for α2b mrna was found. this was further confirmed by northern blot analysis . initially, total rna isolated from sh-sy5y cells did not produce the α2a-ar pcr products using the antisense primer selective for α2a-ar previously described  <cit> . instead α2a-ar rt-pcr product was obtained only with poly mrna. however, employing poly-enriched mrna in the rt-pcr did not yield an α2b-ar rt-pcr product. parsley et al.  <cit> ) identified only α2c-ar mrna using total rna isolated from sh-sy5y cells; this observation may reflect the limitation associated with the α2a-ar primers used for rt-pcr of total rna, similar to what we encountered.

the rank order binding affinity of the various agonists and antagonists tested is in agreement with that previously reported in cells expressing recombinant  <cit>  or native α2a-ars  <cit> . when we compared apparent pki values for various α2-ar agonists and antagonists against binding to rauwolscine in sh-sy5y membrane homogenates with previously reported values, we saw a correlation only with those cells that expressed α2a-ars . another means of distinguishing between various α2-ar subtypes involves comparing the prazosin/oxymetazoline  or oxy/yohimbine affinity ratios . prazosin/oxy  and oxy/yohimbine  ratios were within the range reported for native and recombinant α2a-ars, and differ by at least 10-fold from values reported for α2c-ar . the agonist potency series in sh-sy5y cells also most closely parallels that reported for the α2a  <cit> . the inhibitory effect of α2-ar agonists on camp production in sh-sy5y cells is readily reversed in a concentration-dependent fashion by the antagonist yohimbine ; the failure of the selective α2b/c antagonist arc- <dig> to antagonize uk  <dig>  is consistent with activation of α2a-ars in sh-sy5y cells. therefore, our results strongly support the designation of the functional α2-ar in sh-sy5y cells as α2a.

the present study supports our previous findings that pretreatment with a modest epi concentration readily desensitizes the α2a-ar signal in the presence, but not in the absence, of the β2-ar. this conclusion is based on several results. first, in wt sh-sy5y cells , the α2a-ar signal is not desensitized following  <dig> hr treatment with modest concentrations of epi or ne . instead wt cells required chronic exposure to supra-physiological concentrations of catecholamines  for desensitization of the α2a-ar signal; supporting the fact that α2a-ars do not desensitize and/or down-regulate readily in response to low to moderate levels of epi. second,  <dig> nm epi induces α2a-ar desensitization only in shβ2ar <dig> cells which express functional β2-ar. finally, epi-generated waning of the α2a-ar response is not observed in transfected cells expressing the pcdna plasmid vector minus the β2-ar gene. this observation suggests that introduction of the β2-ar, and not the vector, is responsible for the difference in the α2a-ar signal between wt and shβ2ar <dig> cells exposed chronically to modest epi concentrations.

as previously observed in be-c cells  <cit> , desensitization of α2a-ar signal with  <dig> hr epi exposure is due, in part, to down-regulation of the receptor in shβ2ar <dig> cells. chronic co-activation of both α2a- and β2-ar is required for desensitization and down-regulation of the α2a-ar in shβ2ar <dig> cells as indicated by the following results. first,  <dig> nm epi, but not  <dig> μm ne, produces α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation in the recombinant cell line. lands et al.  <cit>  established that epi has equal affinity for α2a- and β2-ar while ne has a higher affinity for the α2-ar than β2-ar; therefore, epi activates both α2a- and β2-ars simultaneously while ne activates the α2a-ar alone. it is evident that the modest epi concentration readily activates the β2-ar since chronic pretreatment with  <dig> nm epi, but not  <dig> μm ne, desensitized the β2-ar response. second, the inclusion of the β2-ar blocker propranolol prevented epi-induced α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation in β2-ar-transfected sh-sy5y cells. this propranolol concentration  is sufficient to prevent epi activation of β2-ar as indicated by the inhibition of epi-induced β2-ar desensitization.

although chronic epi treatment desensitized and down-regulated α2a-ar in both be-c and shβ2ar <dig> cells, several differences were observed. first, a more profound loss of efficacy is observed following  <dig> hr epi exposure in be-c cells as compared to shβ2ar <dig> cells. the maximal inhibition of forskolin-stimulated camp accumulation by uk <dig>  was reduced 54% in be-c, but only 27% in shβ2ar <dig>  cells following epi treatment . the greater down-regulation of α2a-ars observed in be-c versus shβ2ar <dig> cells most likely accounts for the greater change in efficacy: in shβ2ar <dig>  chronic epi treatment produces a 20% loss of α2a-ars while in be-c cells, there is a 60% α2a-ar down-regulation . this more profound α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation observed in be-c is mediated via the up-regulation of grk <dig>  <cit> . the lack of grk <dig> up-regulation in the shβ2ar <dig> cells is the second major difference between the two cell lines. at present, it is unknown what prompts grk <dig> up-regulation in be-c cells but not in the shβ2ar <dig> cells. however, we have observed that erk1/ <dig> activation is required for this induction of grk <dig> following chronic exposure of be-c cells to epi  <cit> . moreover, while α2a-ars do not readily activate this pathway in neuronal cells, and β-ar activation by iso can activate erk1/ <dig> at high concentrations, we have observed that erk1/ <dig> activation by epi at concentrations that up-regulate grk <dig> appears to require the simultaneous activation of both α2a- and β2-ars. conversely, the inability of transfected β-ars to prompt erk1/ <dig> activation in sh-sy5y cells could explain the lack of grk <dig> up-regulation in shβ2ar <dig> cells.

even though total grk <dig> levels are unaltered, grks play a role in β2-ar-regulated α2a-ar signaling in shβ2ar <dig> cells as indicated by several results. first chronic epi treatment enhances localization of grk <dig> and grk <dig> to the membrane. as indicated previously, translocation of these two cytosolic kinases to the membrane is required for phosphorylation and subsequent desensitization of its receptor substrate, which in this study is the α2a-ar. second, addition of propranolol attenuated epi-mediated translocation of both grk isoforms. this same propranolol concentration also inhibited α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation as discussed above. therefore, β2-ar co-activation with α2a-ar is required for enhanced grk <dig> and grk <dig> translocation to the membrane and subsequent α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation.

translocation of both grk <dig> and grk <dig> to the membrane following chronic epi treatment in shβ2ar <dig> cells differs from the selective translocation of grk <dig>  observed in be-c cells following the same treatment . the selective grk <dig> up-regulation in be-c cells could account for the enhanced grk <dig> levels at the membrane in these cells since in a previous study increase in total grk <dig> levels promoted increased grk <dig> expression at the membrane  <cit> . it is unknown at present why chronic epi treatment translocates both grk <dig> and grk <dig> in shβ2ar <dig> cells, and not in be-c cells. a possible explanation for the difference in the grk isoform translocation between the two cell lines is differences in the β subunit expressed and/or released upon epi exposure. grk <dig> and grk <dig> require the βγ subunit of the g proteins to anchor to the membrane but grk <dig> and grk <dig> exhibit distinct binding preferences for individual β subunits  <cit> . the β <dig> isoform preferentially binds grk <dig> but not grk <dig>  whereas β <dig> and β <dig> bind equally to both grk <dig> and grk <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
based on results obtained in this series of experiments, we conclude that exposure to modest epi concentrations readily desensitizes and down-regulates α2a-ars in the presence, but not in the absence, of a functional β-ar. the β-ar-dependent down-regulation of α2a-ars is modulated via grks. in be-c cells, chronic co-activation of β- and α2a-ar prompts enhanced expression of grk <dig>  but not grk <dig>  in whole cells  <cit>  and membrane fractions. in contrast, epi pretreatment of sh-sy5y cells transfected with functional β2-ars does not increase either grk <dig> or grk <dig> expression per se, but does increase translocation of grk <dig> and grk <dig> to the plasma membrane. like α2a-ar desensitization and down-regulation, this translocation of grk <dig> and grk <dig> in shβ2ar <dig> cells is β-ar-dependent and thus presents an alternate mechanism for the regulation of the α2a-ars by β-ars.
