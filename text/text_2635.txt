BACKGROUND
natural antisense transcripts  are endogenous rna molecules that exhibit partial or complete complementarity to other transcripts. cis-nats are transcribed from the opposite dna strand as their sense transcripts from the same genomic loci. genome-wide analyses have revealed that cis-nats are widespread in eukaryotes  <cit> . in animal and plant genomes, l7-30% of the genes encode complementary cis-nats  <cit> . in animals, nats are involved in alternative splicing, dna methylation, rna editing and genomic imprinting  <cit> . in plants, several cis-nats take part in gene regulatory events through cis-nat-derived small interferering rnas   <cit> . cis-nats have been identified on genome-wide scale in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . these cis-nats produce nat-sirnas in the regions overlapping with sense transcripts and the nat-sirnas exhibit strand-specificity   <cit> .

small non-coding rnas are well known as an important regulatory factor in gene networks, and are widely involved in different development stages and stress responses. based on the genomic origins of their precursors, srnas can be divided into four categories: micrornas , trans-acting small interfering rnas , nat sirnas , and repeat-associated sirnas  <cit> . among these four categories, the biogenesis and function of mirna are best understood  <cit> , and they participate in a broad range of developmental and stress response events  <cit> . most mirnas are derived from intergenic regions, although some of them are processed from introns of protein-coding genes  <cit> . nat-sirnas that participate in stress responses at specific development stage have been discovered in recent years. the first identified salt-induced nat-sirnas were derived from the antisense overlapping gene pair of delta -pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase , a stress-related gene ; 24-nt  sirnas are formed by a biogenesis pathway dependent on dicer-like  <dig> , while a phase for the subsequent generation of 21-nt sirnas are established by dcl <dig>  <cit> . in  <dig>  a pathogen-induced nat-sirna was found and its biogenesis required dcl <dig>  <cit> . a plant sperm-specific nat-sirna plays an important role in controlling sperm function during double fertilization  <cit> . however, the general biogenesis process and regulatory mechanisms of nats and nat-sirnas are still largely unclear.

brassica rapa comprises several important leaf vegetable crops, and its genome is considered to be mesohexaploid and derived from a triplicated diploid ancestral genome that was closely related to the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . recently, many conserved and novel mirnas have been identified in b. rapa through srna deep sequencing  <cit> . however, the genome-wide cis-nats and heat-responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa are still unknown. leaf vegetable crops are much more sensitive to high temperature than fruit vegetable crops. some of b. rapa varieties are highly sensitive to high temperature, and thus have very circumscribed growing seasons.

the common symptoms of heat sensitivity  are leaf etiolation and wilting  <cit> . under too-warm conditions, many b. rapa varieties exhibit these traits and stop growing. in recent years, a great deal of attention has been paid to elucidating the mechanisms of heat-sensitivity in b. rapa. high temperature suppresses the production of some chloroplast-specific small rnas that may function in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. using rna and small rna sequencing datasets, we detected the genome-wide cis-nats and heat-responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa.

RESULTS
gene models and cis-nats in b. rapa
in the b. rapa genome v <dig> , wang et al. annotated  <dig> gene models, including only coding sequences  without un-translated regions   <cit> . to identify the genome-wide cis-nats in b. rapa, we performed the rna sequencing using rna isolated from b. rapa ssp. chinensis cv. wut, a heat-sensitive variety, and b. rapa ssp. pekinensis cv. bre, a less heat-sensitive variety. in the seedlings,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads were present in bre and wut, respectively; and the inflorescence apices yielded  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads in bre and wut, respectively .

using the tophat-cufflink pipeline  <cit> , the transcripts detected from seedlings and inflorescence apices of bre and wut were assembled . after alignment with the annotated genes of b. rapa,  <dig> and  <dig> gene models with the longest transcripts were extracted for bre and wut, respectively. in addition to the mirnas identified from wut in a previous study  <cit> ,  <dig> conserved mirna precursors  and  <dig> brassica-specific pre-mirnas were newly annotated . interestingly, four intronic mirnas were derived from their host genes and bra-mir156b- <dig> originated from the 10th intron of its host gene bra <dig>  while bra-mir <dig> from the 11th intron of its host gene bra <dig>  the homolog of atdcl <dig> in arabidopsis . furthermore, two brassica-speicific intronic mirnas were discovered: bra-mir <dig> was processed from the 5th intron of bra <dig> and bra-mir <dig> from the sole intron of bra <dig> .

to select cis-nats, we searched for gene pairs that overlapped by more than  <dig> nt and were transcribed from the opposite dna strands. we detected  <dig> and  <dig> pairs of cis-nats in bre and wut, respectively . the cis-nats were categorized into three types: convergent , divergent  and enclosed . most of cis-nats in b. rapa were convergent-orientated , consistent with the reports in arabidopsis. of these cis-nats,  <dig> were identified in both bre and wut and there were a total of  <dig> cis-nats in the two varieties. eight cis-nats were coincidently the precursors of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> . for example, bra-mir398b- <dig> overlapped with bra <dig> and bra-mir408a with bra <dig> . in this case, some srnas might be derived from mirna precursor rather than cis-nats. therefore, the cis-nats that overlapped with mirna precursors were excluded from the cis-nat database.

conserved and novel cis-nats in b. rapa
using the arabidopsis genome annotation , we detected  <dig> pairs of cis-nat with overlapping region that was more than 25-nt in arabidopsis. based on the homologous gene annotation between arabidopsis and brassica <cit> , we found that  <dig> conserved cis-nats in b. rapa corresponded to  <dig> cis-nats in arabidopsis .  <dig> cis-nats in arabidopsis had two copies cis-nats in b. rapa, while cis-nat pair of at3g12250/at3g <dig> had  <dig> copies of cis-nats in b. rapa. thus,  <dig> novel cis-nats were brassica-specific. among  <dig> cis-nats that generated nat-sirnas in b. rapa,  <dig> were conserved in arabidopsis, revealing that approximately  <dig> cis-nats produced nat-sirnas specifically in b. rapa. in arabidopsis, zhang et al. identified  <dig> cis-nats that give rise to nat-sirnas from  <dig> srna libraries  <cit> .  <dig> of them existed in b. rapa.

nat-sirnas in overlapping region of cis-nats
to survey genome-wide nat-sirnas derived from cis-nats, we constructed and data mined six srna libraries. two were prepared from the seedlings of bre exposed to biotic stress and four from the seedling of wut exposed to abiotic stress. for biotic stress, bre plants were either uninfected  or infected by the bacterial strain erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora , which causes soft rot disease  <cit> . wut plants were exposed to either 22°c  or 46°c  for 1 h, with two replicates   <cit> . in total, we obtained  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million srna reads in the control and bacteria-infected bre plants, respectively, and  <dig>  million,  <dig>  million,  <dig>  million and  <dig>  million reads in ht <dig>  ht <dig>  nt <dig>  and nt <dig> wut seedlings, respectively. the abundance of each dataset was normalized to rp10m .

we searched for srnas with more than  <dig> reads perfectly matched with 20– <dig> nt of the overlapping regions in the cis-nats, and found  <dig> pairs of nat-sirnas in bre and  <dig> pairs in wut . in total,  <dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> unique nat-sirnas and  <dig> reads corresponding to  <dig> unique nat-sirnas were detected in overlapping regions of bre and wut cis-nats, respectively. the nat-sirnas had a length bias of 21-nt, consistent with those in oryza sativa <cit>  . the nat-sirnas exhibited a bias for adenine in both the two varieties . we analyzed the cis-nats that generate nat-sirnas with strand bias. by calculating the ratios of nat-sirna reads on forward strand versus reverse strands, we found that the nat-sirnas from  <dig> bre cis-nats and  <dig> wut cis-nats exhibited strand bias, with ratios greater than two-fold and p-value < <dig>  . among  <dig> pairs of cis-nat generating nat-sirnas,  <dig> exhibited strand bias .

nat-sirnas responsive to heat stress
to identify heat-responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa, we compared the abundance of nat-sirnas produced at nt and ht in wut . we found that the nat-sirnas from six cis-nats increased under heat stress, while those from six decreased . among them, four cis-nats that gave rise to nat-sirnas were conserved in arabidopsis. heat-responsive nat-sirnas from  <dig> cis-nats exhibited strand bias, implying that they targeted the genes in the opposite strands of cis-nats. the cis-nat pair bra018216/bra <dig> belonged to the enclosed type; the entire transcript of bra <dig> was in the opposite strand of bra <dig> 3′-utr . nat-sirnas from bra018216/bra <dig> pair were induced specifically by heat, and nat-sirnas derived from the strand of bra <dig> were most abundant . northern blotting confirmed that the abundance of nat-sirnas derived from bra <dig> was much higher at ht than at nt .

to define the relationship between cis-nats and nat-sirnas at high temperature, we performed real-time pcr of both bra <dig> and bra <dig> transcripts. at high temperature, bra <dig> levels sharply increased, whereas those of bra <dig> decreased . these changes were concurrent with an increase in abundance of the heat-induced nat-sirnas derived from bra <dig>  the homologous cis-nat pair of bra018216/bra <dig> in arabidopsis is at3g46230/at3g <dig>  at3g <dig> encodes a class i small heat-shock protein  hsp <dig>  that shows a role in heat resistance. we compared the relative expressions of these two genes using the abiotic stress data of atgenexpress  <cit> . under the condition of 38°c for 3 h, at3g <dig> was specifically repressed, while at3g <dig> was sharply induced in both seedlings and roots . thus, the homologous cis-nat pair at3g46230/ at3g <dig> also generates nat-sirnas responsive to heat stress. the nat-sirnas from the bra040444/ bra <dig> cis-nat pair were induced by heat stress. similarly, the expression of bra <dig> was also induced by heat stress, while bra <dig> was repressed . the 3′-utr of bra <dig> generated many more nat-sirnas than the coding region . like bra <dig>  the homologous at3g <dig> in arabidopsis was induced under heat stress. nevertheless, at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> did not overlap to form cis-nats . at3g <dig> was insensitive to heat, while its homolog bra <dig> was repressed by the nat-sirnas. real-time pcr showed that bra <dig> was up-regulated in wut seedlings, while most nat-sirnas derived from the strands of bra <dig> decreased under heat stress .

discussion
more cis-nats and nat-sirnas in b. rapa after genome triplication
in this study, we globally identified  <dig> cis-nats and  <dig> nat-sirnas derived from  <dig> cis-nats in two varieties of b. rapa. the nat-sirnas are thought to be processed from overlapping regions of transcribed cis-nats. the diploid ancestral genome of mesohexaploid b. rapa was closely related to the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . comparison of cis-nats between these two species showed that  <dig> conserved cis-nats in b. rapa corresponded to  <dig> cis-nats in arabidopsis.  <dig> arabidopsis cis-nats have two or three copies of homologous cis-nats in b. rapa. in b. rapa, cis-nats with more than  <dig> copies would crosstalk with each other and form trans-nats. based on pairwise alignments of transcripts,  <dig> cis-nats that produce nat-sirnas in b. rapa are conserved in arabidopsis, implying that the two thirds of the cis-nats in b. rapa generate specific nat-sirnas. when nat-sirnas are examined in other subspecies and varieties of b. rapa, more nat-sirnas from conserved cis-nats will be detected. the interaction of multiple copies of cis-nats must be more complex, but should not bring chaos, because the individual variants with chaos are died out during evolution.

the nat-sirnas in coding sequences are more conserved than those in other regions as described in arabidopsis lyrata <cit> . the roles of conserved cis-nats and nat-sirnas may be general in development events or response to environment stimuli of plants, whereas those of the novel cis-nats in b. rapa should be specific. interestingly, some brassica-specific cis-nats and nat-sirnas are more than two. these overlapping-sequences are differentiated over time, since many snps has been identified in different brassica crops. possibly, two copies of an arabidopsis cis-nat in b. rapa occurs when they are trans-nats . our study is focused on cis-nats rather than trans-nats, which are more complex. it is not known whether cis-nats and trans-nats are different in regulation of target genes.

previous work in arabidopsis indicated that nat-sirnas could target and cleave one of the cis-nat at the posttranscriptional level  <cit> . heat-induced nat-sirnas generated from an up-regulated transcript may function in repressing its targets, which should be cleared under heat stress. the nat-sirnas could be generated from both cis-nats and trans-nats, and targets to the transcripts with high sequence complimentarity. because b. rapa has multiple homolog genes, t-dna insertion could knock-out only one copy. however, over-expression of a single cis-nat could knock-down several homologous targets, thus, suggesting potential application of nat-sirnas from cis-nats for improving heat-resistance.

strand bias in heat-responsive cis-nats and nat-sirnas
nat-sirnas has been shown to response to environment stimuli such as salt stress and biotic stress  <cit> . in plants, nat-sirnasro <dig> is induced by salinity  <cit> , while nat-sirnaatgb <dig> only accumulates in response to bacterial pathogen infection  <cit> . however, which nat-sirnas are involved in heat stress is largely unknown, even in arabidopsis. we identified  <dig> cis-nats that respond to heat stress, with strand bias.

the nat-sirnas derived from four conserved cis-nats are conserved in arabidopsis. like the salt-induced gene sro <dig> which forms a double helix with its cis-nat pair p5cdh <cit> , bra <dig> is induced by heat stress, and is complementary to bra <dig> to produce dispersed sirnas. however, the length of nat-sirnas from bra018216/bra <dig> ranged from 20– <dig> nt rather than  <dig> or  <dig> nt. nat-sirnas of 20– <dig> nt are generated by dcl <dig>  whereas the 23–28-nt nat-sirnas are dcl3-dependent  <cit> . the nat-sirnas derived from bra <dig> may repress bra <dig> expression. whether over-expression of bra <dig> would improve the heat resistance of b. rapa remains to be investigated.

potential roles of heat-responsive cis-nats and nat-sirnas
eight of the mirna precursors reported are cis-nats that overlapp with coding genes. in a previous study, we have identified nine mirnas that responded to heat stress in b. rapa <cit> . among them, mir398a and mir398b were very sensitive to heat stress, and mir398b precursor was also decreased under heat stress in b. rapa. heat stress induction of mir <dig> triggers a regulatory loop that is critical for thermotolerance in arabidopsis <cit> . in this study, two mir398b precursors were found to overlaps with their adjacent genes. the question arises whether these adjacent genes are involved in the regulation of mir398–mediated thermotolerance.

heat stress disturbs cellular homeostasis. the accumulation of heat shock proteins under the control of heat stress transcription factors plays a central role in heat resistance  <cit> . in tobacco plants, genetic engineering of the biosynthesis of glycinebetaine enhances thermotolerance of photosystem ii  <cit> , and chloroplastic nadh dehydrogenase in tobacco leaves alleviates the oxidative damage caused by temperature stress  <cit> . three cis-nats that give rise to heat-responsive nat-sirna encoded hsp <dig>  , lhcb <dig> , and ndf <dig> h dehydrogenase complex), meaning that nat-sirna from those cis-nats may play important roles in heat resistance.

the present work is based on putative identifications using bioinformatics tools. northern blots of more nat-sirnas are necessary to confirm the difference in their accumulation between normal and high temperature. more importantly, the direct evidence is dependent on silencing of nat-sirna to the target genes in the transgenic plants. therefore, a great attention should be paid to transfer the nat-sirnas into crops to verify their usefulness for increase in heat-resistance.

in addition to nucleus, the chloroplast is an important organelle that generates srnas. many members of chloroplast srna families are highly sensitive to heat stress, and some silence target genes. to address the roles of heat-responsive nat-sirnas in plant heat resistance, we plan to compare the gene expression patterns of heat-sensitive wut with the less heat-sensitive bre. analyses of the differentially-expressed nat-sirnas could provide insight into the molecular mechanism of nat-sirna-mediated responses. ultimately, these nat-sirnas may be useful for genetic improvement of the heat resistance in chinese cabbage and other important crops.

CONCLUSIONS
in two varieties of b. rapa, we identified  <dig> cis-nats,  <dig> of which gave rise to  <dig> nat-sirnas. of these,  <dig> conserved cis-nats corresponded to  <dig> cis-nats in arabidopsis, indicating that  <dig> novel cis-nats were brassica-specific. the nat-sirnas derived from  <dig> cis-nats responded to heat stress and most exhibited strand bias. our work was the first genome-wide analysis of cis-nats and heat-responsive nat-sirnas in b. rapa; these srnas are potentially useful for genetic improvement of heat tolerance of b. rapa and other crops.
