BACKGROUND
peach  belongs to the spiraeoideae subfamily of the rosaceae  <cit> . the prunus genus is characterized by species producing drupes as fruit, and contains a significant number of economically important fruit tree species such as almond ), apricot , sweet cherry , sour cherry  and plum .

compared to other tree species, peach has a relative small diploid genome   <cit> , and a short juvenile phase . therefore, peach is considered as a model species for rosaceae family and a physical map of its genome has been initiated  <cit> .

among fruit producing rosaceous crops, peach is the second most important fruit crop in europe after apple and the third worldwide . however, the consumption of peaches and nectarines is stagnant due to the low quality of fruits that are harvested at an immature stage for storage and shipment reasons  <cit> . one of the major objectives for peach breeders is to find the right compromise between quality and immaturity at harvest  <cit> . the variation in fruit quality at harvest involves a large number of interrelated factors  <cit>  among which organic acid and soluble sugar contents and composition are major determinants  <cit> . in ripe peach fruit, malic and citric acids are the predominant organic acids, while quinic acid accumulates in lower amounts  <cit> . moreover, the major soluble sugars are sucrose, fructose, glucose and sorbitol  <cit> . sucrose is the predominant soluble sugar at maturity while sorbitol accumulates at very low levels.

in peach, the d locus  was described as dominant and controlling the 'low-acid' character of fruit  <cit> . based on previous segregation analyses of an f <dig> population  obtained from a cross between 'ferjalou jalousia®' low-acid variety and 'fantasia' normally-acid variety, the d locus was mapped on linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . it is co-localized with major qtls for ph, titratable acidity , organic acids concentration and with small qtls for sugars concentration  <cit> . low-acid peach fruit is characterized by reduced contents of malic and citric acids  <cit> , which, however, cannot be explained just by the reduced expression or activity of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase   <cit> , a key enzyme involved in malate synthesis. 'ferjalou jalousia®' fruit has half the concentration of malic acid and one-fifth that of citric acid of 'fantasia' variety  <cit> . using the candidate gene approach,  <dig> genes involved in organic acid synthesis, degradation or vacuolar storage were studied  <cit> . expression analyses in fruit of six selected candidate genes did not show a clear difference between the normally-acid and low-acid varieties  <cit> . the genes showing a modification of their expression in the low-acid fruit compared to the normally-acid fruit were the tonoplastic proton pumps prupe;atpva <dig>  prupe;vp <dig>  and to a lesser extent prupe;vp <dig>  prupe;vp <dig> and prupe;vp <dig> at citric acid peak and maturity, and prupe;atpva <dig> during cell division showed higher expression in the fruit of the low-acid variety . however, none of these candidate genes were located on linkage group  <dig>  excluding their direct role in the control of acid content by the d locus  <cit> . more recently, in the european isafruit integrated project http://www.isafruit.org/portal/index.php, several candidate genes involved in fruit quality were selected and tested on the jxf f <dig> mapping population. however, none of them was located in the region of the d locus 

low-acid varieties have already been described in apple  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and several citrus species  <cit> . in apple, a non-acid mutant from the 'usterapfel' variety showed a content in malic acid ten times less than the normally-acid one  <cit> .

the high level of malic acid was reported to be controlled by the dominant ma allele  <cit>  suggesting that ma and d act at different physiological control points. a cdna-aflp analysis, coupled with a bulk segregant analysis  was recently used to screen genes differently expressed between low- and high-acid apple fruits  <cit> . the authors reported the isolation of a cdna whose expression could only be detected in low-acid fruit at an early stage of fruit development. nevertheless, this cdna showed no homology with any sequences in public databases. moreover, the ma and d loci are not located on homologous chromosomes: ma is located on linkage group  <dig> in malus  <cit> , homologous to linkage group  <dig> in prunus  <cit>  and d is located on linkage group  <dig> in prunus which is homologous to linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> in malus  <cit> . for citrus, the low level of citric acid is controlled by a recessive gene named acitric  <cit> . fruit acidity in citrus seems to be linked to the capacity to accumulate citric acid into the vacuole. low-acid varieties accumulate low amount of citric acid probably because it is exported out from the vacuole  <cit> . two candidate genes such as acid invertase and cytoplasmic isocitrate dehydrogenase were identified to be differentially expressed between acid and low-acid citrus  <cit> . fruit acidity can also be controlled by several chromosome regions as in tomato where several qtls for titratable acidity and ph were identified  <cit>  and several candidate genes were proposed  <cit> . however, to date the mechanism of the genetic control of fruit acidity remains to be elucidated.

in order to identify genes of interest, candidate gene approach can be used when assumptions can be made regarding the biological function of the gene  <cit> . this approach was successfully undertaken for several fruit traits including anthocyanin content for which the biosynthesis pathway and regulating genes were well known  <cit>  and cell wall degradation where implicated genes were identified in other species  <cit> . however, to isolate agronomically important and botanically relevant genes with unknown function and where no clear hypothesis can be made, chromosome landing seems the main strategy by which map-based or positional cloning could be applied  <cit> . the complexity of organic acids metabolic pathways as well as the difficult understanding of the regulation of their transporters and channels and related proton pumps  <cit>  has hampered, so far, the identification of the gene associated to the d locus using a candidate gene approach. thus, in order to understand the molecular and physiological bases of this trait, a positional cloning strategy was initiated and a fine map of the d locus has been constructed. to identify the gene underlying acidity control at the d locus, the first step was to construct a fine map of the d locus. the aims of the present work were:  the characterization of the fruit acidity trait,  the increase of the number of markers tightly linked to the d locus,  the conversion of the nearest markers into sequence characterized amplified region  and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence  markers,  the construction of a high-resolution genetic map of this locus and definition of the position of the d locus with new recombinant individuals phenotyped, and  the evaluation of the genetic distance/physical distance ratio around the d locus using a bac library.

RESULTS
fruit acidity characterization
among the  <dig> individuals used for the genetic linkage map, only  <dig> trees producing fruit were phenotyped for ph and titratable acidity and were classified into three subgroups corresponding to the three genotypes: homozygous for 'ferjalou jalousia®' allele  and for 'fantasia' allele , and heterozygous  at the targeted locus . a significant difference  was observed for ph and ta for the comparisons of jj and jf genotypes, ff and jf genotypes, and jj and ff genotypes  suggesting that the d allele is partially dominant. homozygous jj genotypes showed values higher than  <dig>  for ph and lower than  <dig>  meq/l for ta. on the opposite, ph and ta values for homozygous ff genotypes were respectively lower than  <dig>  and higher than  <dig>  meq/l. the ph of heterozygous jf genotypes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and ta ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  meq/l. thus, normally-acid phenotypes that correspond exclusively to genotypes ff showed ph value lower than  <dig>  and ta value higher than  <dig> meq/l while low-acid phenotypes corresponding to genotypes jj or jf showed ph values higher than  <dig>  and ta value lower than  <dig> meq/l. these results indicate that individuals with intermediate acidity  can be either homozygous dd or heterozygous dd at the d locus and therefore, they cannot be reliably classified into normally-acid or low-acid phenotype.

identification and mapping of aflp markers linked to the d locus
among the  <dig>  primer combinations tested,  <dig> provided readable amplification products. thirty to  <dig> bands were observed on aflp gels per primer combination with a size range from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp, but only  <dig> % of the bands were polymorphic between the 'ferjalou jalousia®' and 'fantasia' parents. markers whose bands were present in bd <dig> and bd <dig> bulks and absent from bd <dig> and bd <dig> bulks were potentially linked to the d locus . a total of  <dig> markers were identified as putatively linked to the d locus . nineteen primer combinations each revealed only one d-linked marker, six primer combinations produced two d-linked markers  and one primer combination revealed three d-linked markers . as expected, all  <dig> aflp markers were mapped on linkage group  <dig>  aflp markers close to the d locus  were clearly polymorphic between bulks. aflp markers mapped further away  were polymorphic markers between bulks but with a very faint band for "d" bulks. fourteen aflp markers were located within the first  <dig> cm containing the d locus.

conversion of aflp markers into scar and caps markers
nine aflp markers linked to the d locus were converted into simple codominant pcr-based markers. four of them were codominant markers and five were dominant markers . the codominant aflp markers  were successfully converted into scar markers  and were confirmed as codominant markers . the codominant aflp markers ptc-gta218f-219j revealed a deletion of one nucleotide in 'fantasia' compared to 'ferjalou jalousia®'. after sequencing the two alleles, three single nucleotide polymorphisms  were detected; one of them was revealed after digestion with the restriction enzyme acci and directly observed on agarose gel. this codominant cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence  marker was named d-scar <dig> .

for the dominant aflp markers, primers were designed from the sequences of individuals carrying the d allele. they were then tested on 'ferjalou jalousia®', 'fantasia' and on the f1-jf: <dig> hybrid used to construct the f <dig> mapping progeny. the comparison of the sequences obtained for the ptg-tgg470j marker revealed a deletion of six nucleotides in 'fantasia' as compared to 'ferjalou jalousia®' sequence. this aflp marker was then transformed into a codominant scar marker  . for ptc-ctg470j, the sequencing of the two alleles revealed one snp. the alleles can be discriminated by digesting the pcr products with msei. this caps marker was called d-scar <dig> . for the three dominant aflp markers pgt-ttg188j, pca-gcg149f and pca-gcg132j, no polymorphism was detected.

the six polymorphic scar markers were subsequently used to genotype the  <dig> individuals of the genetic linkage map; it confirmed that their localization was the same as aflp markers .

furthermore, considering the total size of the obtained sequences , this analysis revealed seven snps. based on these results the frequency of the snps at the vicinity of the d locus was estimated to  <dig>  snps per kb.

high resolution mapping of the d locus
the fine mapping of the d locus was performed in two steps using the six scar markers described in the present study and three ssr markers ma026a, bppct <dig> and cppct <dig> already mapped to the proximal end of the linkage group  <dig>  <cit> . the first step was to genotype the  <dig>  individuals from the seven segregating populations with three scar markers  and two ssr markers  spanning a region of  <dig>  cm around the d locus . a total of  <dig> individuals were found to have at least one recombination event between the farthest markers, ma026a and bppct <dig>  the second step was to genotype the resulting  <dig> recombinant individuals with the three other scar markers  and cppct <dig> which were located within the spanned region. according to the recombination events between these nine markers, it was possible to determine the precise marker order on linkage group  <dig> .

for the  <dig> recombinant individuals which produced fruits in  <dig> and  <dig>  ta mean values varied from  <dig> to  <dig> meq/l and ph mean values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . among these recombinants,  <dig> individuals were classified as producing low-acid fruit,  <dig> were identified as producing normally-acid fruit and  <dig> were considered as intermediate and were therefore, not classified. among the individuals producing low-acid fruit, only  <dig> individuals recombining from heterozygous  to homozygous  were informative. then, only  <dig> recombinant individuals with extreme values for ph  and ta  were used to identify the position of the d locus. among the  <dig> recombinant individuals so selected,  <dig> recombinant individuals between cppct <dig> and bppct <dig> indicated that the d locus was located upper than cppct <dig>  while fourteen other individuals recombining between ma026a and d-scar <dig> proved that the d locus was not localized between ma026a and d-scar <dig> . two phenotyped individuals recombining between d-scar <dig> and cppct <dig> reduced the interval containing the d locus: s5848- <dig> showed that the d locus was located upper than cppct <dig> while s6422- <dig> demonstrated that it was located below d-scar <dig> . therefore, it can be concluded that the d locus is localized in a  <dig>  cm interval between d-scar <dig> and cppct <dig> .

evaluation of the physical/genetic distance ratio around the d locus using a new bac library
the peach bac library produced from f1-jf: <dig> dna contained about  <dig>  clones. based on the analyses of a subset of clones, the average insert size was estimated at  <dig> kb, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb. according to these preliminary results the covering of this bac library was estimated at 15– <dig> × the peach haploid genome. d-scar <dig> and d-scar <dig> were used to screen the bac library and four positive clones were found with d-scar <dig> and  <dig> with d-scar <dig>  three of the four positive clones with d-scar <dig> were found to be also positive when screened with d-scar <dig>  the ratio between the genetic and physical distances was estimated using markers defined from bacend sequences of a positive clone common to both d-scar <dig> and d-scar <dig> . a distance of  <dig>  cm was estimated between the two caps markers f109-15- <dig> and r109-15- <dig>  derived from the bacend sequences of one bac containing an insert of  <dig> kb. this results in  <dig> cm corresponding to  <dig> kb in the region of the d locus.

discussion
we describe in this paper major steps towards the cloning of the gene controlling fruit acidity in peach, by phenotypic, genetic and physical characterization of the d locus.

the low polymorphism observed between 'ferjalou jalousia®' and 'fantasia' using aflp markers was previously reported using rflp and ssr markers  <cit>  and was likely the consequence of the very low genetic distance between these two parental varieties  <cit> . polymorphic markers would have been considerably increased by deep sequencing methods of the aflps  <cit> . using the classical aflp method in combination with bulk segregant analysis,  <dig> aflp markers located within the  <dig> cm region harbouring the d locus were identified and no marker was mapped to another linkage group. these results confirmed that acidity trait in peach is not complex and should be controlled by a major gene.

sequence analysis of the aflp markers selected for conversion into scar revealed, at the vicinity of the d locus, an snps frequency  <dig>  fold lower than the one reported in the 'texas' × 'earlygold'  reference prunus map derived from an almond × peach interspecific cross .

to more accurately position the d locus, it was necessary to identify individuals of the extended population that had recombination events tightly linked to the d locus. the strategy followed in the present work involving two successive steps  reduced considerably the number of individuals that needed to be genotyped and phenotypically characterized. fruit acidity is usually evaluated by ph or ta measurements. in this work, the use of both ph and ta was essential for the characterization of fruit acidity. in addition, the definition of thresholds based on the analyses of individuals without recombination event in the ma026a-bppct <dig> interval allowed a precise characterization of the phenotype. thus, the phenotyping of the recombinant individuals with the ph and ta threshold strategy prevented misclassification of intermediate individuals that can be either homozygous  or heterozygous  for the d locus.

the development of tightly linked markers and the phenotyping of recombinant individuals allowed the precise localization of the d locus. as fruit acidity is a major selection criterion, the d-linked markers could be used for marker assisted selection which would allow early selection of trees with the desirable character.

to estimate the relationship between the genetic and the physical distance at the vicinity of the d locus we anchored a bac clone to the genetic map. based on this analysis the ratio was estimated to  <dig> kb/cm. at the peach evergrowing  locus the ratio was estimated to  <dig> to  <dig> kb/cm  <cit> . these ratios are smaller than the estimated average ratio on the txe prunus reference map  <cit>  which is  <dig> kb/cm according to the genome size  <cit> . this is not surprising, as the physical/genetic distance ratio is known to vary along chromosomes  <cit> . the identification of the physical/genetic distance ratio in the vicinity of the d locus was important for estimating the number of walks needed for cloning the d locus. the d locus was localized in a  <dig>  cm interval corresponding to a physical distance of  <dig> kb. thus, one or two walks with bac clones with an insert size of  <dig> kb should be sufficient to identify a bac clone harbouring the d locus.

sequenced bac clones in peach  <cit> , plum, apricot  <cit>  and pear  <cit>  revealed a gene density of  <dig> to  <dig> genes per  <dig> kb genomic sequence. thus, in the  <dig> kb d locus region  <dig> to  <dig> candidate genes are expected. to identify the d gene among these candidate genes, the aim will be to map accurately the recombination events relative to the predicted genes. to facilitate this analysis, the ppjfh bac library was constructed from the f1-jf: <dig> hybrid between 'ferjalou jalousia®' and 'fantasia' to identify one bac clone for each allele. the two orthologous bac clones will be sequenced and annotated and genetically dissected. in further analyses, the natural variability of the candidate genes will be explored within a peach germplasm collection to associate the haplotype to the phenotypic variation. functional studies such as reverse genetics experiments should then provide further evidence for or against their involvement in fruit acidity.

the complete sequencing of the bac clones will provide candidate genes for the d locus. these candidate genes may be structural genes implicated in metabolism or transport in agreement with our existing knowledge of fruit physiology or genes with novel structural or regulatory functions. sequencing data will also provide information about prunus genome organization in this particular region, which may be compared to homologous region in other rosaceae species and even other fruit species. microsystems analysis across rosaceae species will provide insight into gene order, orientation and structural rearrangements of this particular region and through comparative genomics, may contribute to improve our knowledge on evolutionary and diversification processes among this family as demonstrated for oryza  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the present work describes, for the first time, the fine mapping of a locus involved in a fruit quality trait on perennial plants via the chromosome landing approach. the development of tightly linked markers and the phenotyping of recombinant individuals allowed the precise localization of the d locus in a  <dig>  cm interval corresponding to  <dig> kb. using the constructed ppjfh bac library with a mean insert size of  <dig> kb, one or two walks should be sufficient to identify a bac clone harbouring the d locus. to our knowledge, only few fine genetic maps were realized using a large number of trees and only for resistance genes  <cit> . one of the major limitations for this strategy is the generation of a large population requiring an extended orchard maintained over several years. our mapping population of  <dig>  plants that segregates for many agronomic traits as well as the ppjfh bac library will permit the genetic dissection of, not only the d locus, but also other traits such as af , s , g  and ps . this mapping population could be also exploited in any future genome sequencing project in peach where anchoring sequences or bac contigs to the genetic map is a crucial step.
