BACKGROUND
the syrian golden hamster  is highly susceptible to a number of human pathogens. the hamster has been described as a relevant experimental model that more representative of human disease than either the mouse or rat models for a number of human pathogens, including leishmania  spp.  <cit> , l. donovani  <cit> , trypanosoma cruzi  <cit> , entamoeba histolytica  <cit> , leptospira and treponema  <cit> , hantavirus  <cit> , eastern equine encephalitis virus  <cit> , yellow fever virus  <cit> , west nile virus  <cit> , nipah virus  <cit> , hookworm  <cit> , and various fungi and mycobacteria. unfortunately, the use of the hamster in research has been hindered by the lack of commercially available immunological and molecular reagents to investigate mechanisms of disease.

the cloning and sequence analysis of portions of syrian hamster interleukin  <dig> , il- <dig>  gamma interferon , tumor necrosis factor alpha , il- <dig>  il- 12p <dig>  and transforming growth factor beta  cdna were reported previously  <cit> , and these sequences have been used by a number of investigators to measure cytokine expression by northern blotting and conventional semi-quantitative rt-pcr  <cit> . more recently real-time quantitative reverse transcription-pcr assays for the quantification of cytokine mrna expression using two-step sybr green i rt-pcr protocols were used  <cit> .

studies in animal models of parasitic infections have shown that t lymphocytes and cytokines play a crucial role in the outcome of infection, both in terms of protective immunity and immunopathology. of particular interest is the evidence that parasitic infections can trigger polarized cd4+ t cell subset responses, and that cytokines produced by different th <dig> or th <dig> cells in the host can have opposing effects, resulting in either control of infection or promotion of disease  <cit> . there is enormous variety in the expression patterns of cytokine genes, i.e., they can be either constitutively expressed or can be activated or repressed when a cell is exposed to a particular signal  <cit> . most of these responses appear to be controlled at the level of transcription and mrna stability  <cit>  so quantification by real-time rt pcr is widely used to investigate the immune response to various stimuli.

to better understand the hamster immune response to important pathogens, we determined the nucleotide sequence of additional hamster cytokines and chemokines , one chemokine receptor , and one transcriptional factor . these cdnas were chosen for study because of their role in a type  <dig> or regulatory t cell response, both of which have potential importance in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis. this technical report describes the standardization of one step  real time pcr for the detection of these hamster mrnas, and their application was validated in a model of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis.

RESULTS
the syrian hamster, because of its distinct immunological features and susceptibility to intracellular pathogens provides a unique opportunity for study of models relevant to human disease. however, studies in hamsters are limited by the relative unavailability of tools to conduct immunological studies. previously, we identified sequences for several hamster cytokine cdnas and used these to assess the immunological responses to infection using northern blotting and conventional rt-pcr. we have now extended these studies by isolating and cloning a number of additional hamster cdnas and developing and standardizing duplex real-time rt pcr assays for measurement of gene expression of  <dig> different mrnas, which included cytokines, chemokines, a chemokine receptor and a transcription factor. while the measurement of protein levels has the most relevance to understanding immunopathogenesis and immunity, most cytokines/immune response genes are transcriptionally regulated, enabling the use of quantitative real time pcr to detect and quantify their expression. we were particularly interested in measuring the expression of these mrnas because of their potential role in the immunopathogenesis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

the newly isolated and cloned cdnas included small portions of hamster il- <dig>  il- <dig> and foxp <dig>  and the complete open reading frame  of the hamster ccl <dig>  ccl <dig> and ccr <dig>  all the cdna sequences  were analyzed using basic local alignment search toll   <cit>  from the national center from biotechnology information  using the nucleotide collection  database and the discontiguous megablast algorithm .

the source and size of the cloned cdna and the percent identity of the sequence to the ortholog of other species are summarized in table  <dig>  of note, three different cdna clones containing the  <dig> bp hamster ccr <dig> orf were isolated from cdna that had been reverse transcribed at 55°c from mrna from lymph node tissue of a hookworm infected hamster. like the other cloned cdnas, each clone was sequenced twice in each direction. three dna polymorphisms were detected in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  position  <dig> and  <dig> are predicted to make changes in the amino acid sequence. the real-time rt pcr primers and probe for ccr <dig> were designed to avoid the polymorphic positions. the primers and probes used for all of the real time pcr assays are shown in table  <dig>

for all the duplex rt-pcr assays the pcr product size was small , to limit the impact of infrequent rna damage  <cit> . because the amplification of the target gene and the reference gene  were made in the same reaction tube, the concentrations of primers and probes of both genes were optimized to avoid preferential amplification of the more abundant transcript  <cit>  . for an optimal duplex reaction the amplification efficiencies of the target and reference genes should be approximately equal  <cit> . therefore, validation assays were performed by amplification of the target and reference genes using serial dilutions of rna. in each of the real-time rt pcr assays, the efficiencies were estimated for both the target and reference mrnas by determining the slope   <cit> ) of the lines using the formula e =  <dig>  <cit> . real-time amplification efficiencies of both target and reference genes of e =  <dig> are ideal  <cit> . to illustrate this, the amplification plots, standard curves and validation experiment data for ccr <dig> duplex assay, which are representative of all the genes studied, are shown in figure  <dig>  for the other assays the quality of the standard curves and amplification efficiencies can be judged from their slopes and correlation coefficients. in each case the absolute value of the slope of the line of each validation experiment was  <dig>  or less , indicating that the target and reference mrnas were amplified with equal efficiencies.

the equal efficiencies of amplification of the target and reference mrna allowed for the comparative ct  method to be used to determine the relative level of gene expression  <cit> . this mathematical model calculates changes in gene expression as a relative fold difference between an experimental and a calibrator sample and includes a correction for non-ideal amplification efficiencies  <cit> . hamster bhk cells, which generally express cytokines and chemokines at a low level, were used as the external calibrator to enable the calculation of basal levels of gene expression in the uninfected hamster. in this way, we avoided having to assign the levels of mrna expression in uninfected hamsters to the arbitrary value of  <dig>  which enabled the variation in the uninfected group to be utilized in the statistical analysis. because we used a relative method to calculate the gene expression, the numeric value of the fold change calculation depends on the ct values of the normalizer and the calibrator used. with this approach, regardless of the calibrator used, the values of differences between the experimental groups are maintained. the low expression of the target genes in bhk cells allowed for the calculation of levels of expression such that the relative level of expression in the experimental tissue was always a positive value. since the goal of these studies was to make comparison between the uninfected and infected tissue, determination of the absolute level of expression was unnecessary. the ct value for the target genes in bhk cells ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  for those genes that were expressed at a very low level  in bhk cells, such as foxp <dig>  there is a high level of calculated expression in both the uninfected and infected tissue. conversely, for the genes expressed more highly in bhk cells, such as tgf-β with a ct =  <dig>  the calculated level of expression in the hamster tissues is low. however, as noted above, this method is designed for the comparison of the two samples, in this case infected an uninfected tissue, and not for the absolute quantification of mrna levels.

we used a well-established model of localized cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by l. panamensis  <cit>  to test the application of the standardized and validated duplex assays. in this model, at one-week post infection there is early evidence of a clinical lesion  and parasites are easily identified in the tissue. thereafter the lesion increases in size until 2- <dig> weeks post-infection when it is nodular with crusting and central necrosis . after 3- <dig> weeks postinfection it transitions to a stable chronic lesion containing fewer parasites . we investigated the immune response early in the course of infection because the innate and early adaptive immune responses are known to shape the clinical outcome and immunity in other models of leishmania infection  <cit> .

the role of type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis is well known  <cit> . our studies to dissect the immunopathogenic mechanisms in this model of lcl are ongoing, but several aspects of this preliminary work deserve comment. after relative quantification and normalization, we found that there were tissue-specific differences in the basal expression of several genes . there was relatively greater basal expression in the ln compared to the skin for most transcripts . conversely, the assays identified that basal expression of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> mrnas was significantly greater in the normal skin compared to the ln , consistent with their prominent expression in langerhans cells  and immature dendritic cells   <cit> . at an early stage  there was concomitant upregulation of the type  <dig>  and type  <dig>  cytokines at the site of cutaneous infection . this mixed cytokine response is reminiscent of what is seen in chronic nonhealing, but nonprogressive, l. mexicana infection in some strains of mice  <cit> . we also found that the levels of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> mrnas, which are strongly up-regulated upon dc maturation  <cit> , were up-regulated at the cutaneous site of infection of hamsters infected with l. panamensis , consistent with the notion dcs are activated by leishmania  <cit> . to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the induction of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> expression in response to leishmania infection. these chemokines have been implicated in the recruitment of activated th <dig> cells and regulatory t cells, by signaling through the cc chemokine receptor  <dig>   <cit> . consistent with this finding, at the site of cutaneous l. panamensis infection, we also found increased expression of foxp <dig> , a transcription factor that is critical for the development and function of mouse cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cells   <cit> .

the sensitive real time rt pcr assays identified fewer infection-induced changes in gene expression in the ln compared to the skin at this early stage of infection. the response in the ln of infected hamsters was polarized toward a type  <dig> response with up-regulation of the type  <dig> cytokines  and il- <dig> ), down-regulation of il- <dig> , and upregulation of the type  <dig> chemokine ccl <dig> and its receptor ccr <dig> . further studies will be needed to determine if the more restricted cytokine expression in the ln compared to the skin is simply because there is shorter period of exposure to parasites in the ln, or because there are organ specific mechanisms that lead to distinct cytokine responses.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here provide evidence that duplex real-time rt pcr is a powerful approach for the quantification of transcription immune response genes in the hamster model. application of the assays developed here to a model of cutaneous leishmaniasis suggests that a balanced type  <dig> and type  <dig> cytokine response contributes to the chronic, nonprogressive nature of this disease. these new molecular tools will further facilitate investigation into the mechanisms of disease in the hamster, not only for models of leishmaniasis, but also for other viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections.
