BACKGROUND
lentiviruses are complex retroviruses that are capable of infecting non-dividing cells <cit> . as a consequence lentiviral vectors, such as those based on hiv- <dig>  efficiently transduce a variety of cell types including embryonic stem cells, haematopoietic cells and neurons, and have been suggested as candidate vectors for both in vivo and ex vivo gene therapy applications  <cit> . a key step in the retroviral life-cycle is integration of the provirus into the host genome. this integrating nature of retroviruses has been exploited in the development of gene transfer vectors and has been deemed essential for certain gene therapy strategies, including ex vivo gene transfer <cit> . however, adverse issues related to the integration of a provirus such as insertional mutagenesis, promoter interference and positional effects have been highlighted by induction of malignancy in mouse models <cit>  and by the development of leukaemia in five patients in two clinical gene therapy trials <cit> . consequently, obtaining adequate safety and efficiency of viral vectors is a focus of interest in vector development.

insertion of chromatin insulator elements into the vector sequence has been proposed as a solution to problems related to the integration of proviruses <cit> . an insulator is a cis-acting element characterized by one or both of the following criteria: it prevents enhancer-promoter interactions, if placed in between these elements, and protects transgenic expression cassettes from silencing and positional effects <cit> . hence, if these characteristics could be transferred to a lentiviral vector it would confer protection from influences of the integrated viral sequence to surrounding endogenous genes, and since it may prevent silencing of a proportion of the proviruses, it may also enhance vector functionality allowing a lower number of integrants to be used in order to achieve therapeutic efficacy. taken together, such improvements of the vector properties would be likely to reduce the risk related to the proviral integration <cit> .

however, before insulators are included into clinical gene therapy vectors, a number of issues remain to be clarified. so far, no studies have clearly demonstrated an enhanced safety of insulator vectors, although it has recently been shown that inclusion of insulators in lentiviral vectors suppresses clonal dominance in vitro and partially protects against genotoxicity and promoter interference  <cit> . furthermore, improved transgene expression from insulator containing retro- and lentiviral vectors has been reported predominantly in cell lines of erythroid origin and appears to be cell-type dependent  <cit> . finally, the inclusion of insulator-sequences has been reported to reduce the titer of viral vector preparations, which complicates transduction of difficult target cells or direct in vivo applications <cit> .

in this study we addressed some of the issues of lentiviral vectors carrying chromatin insulators. for this we designed a set of insulator-lentiviral vectors that were tested in cells of different lineages. we found that lentiviral vectors are indeed capable of incorporating insulator sequences leading to efficient transgene expression in different cell types. however, a careful examination of their functionality suggests that the titer is compromised at a step that takes place after reverse transcription but before proviral integration. this finding has implications for the design of insulator-containing lentiviral vectors and highlights the importance of extensive studies of vector functionality following inclusion of cis-acting elements.

RESULTS
lentiviral vectors
we constructed second generation hiv- <dig> derived lentiviral vectors with the chicken β-globin insulator  in various configurations . all vectors carried the central polypurine tract  and the woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element , which have been shown to enhance the functionality of lentiviral vectors <cit> . we used two promoters, the human cytomegalovirus promoter  and the human elongation factor 1α promoter , in order to avoid misinterpretation of the results due to possible promoter-specific events. the first design of the insulator vectors had tandem copies of the  <dig> bp core element <cit>  placed just upstream of the expression cassette . the second design had a second doublet of the  <dig> bp core element placed just after the transcriptional cassette . we also used our previously reported vector, which carries the full length  <dig>  kb insulator into the 3'ltr  <cit> . this design leads to a duplication of the insulator sequence into the 5' ltr during reverse transcription. as control vectors we used cmv.sin and ef1α.sin .

titers of insulator-containing vectors are reduced
previously, we and others have suggested that the functional titer is reduced when insulator sequences are incorporated into retroviral and lentiviral vectors <cit> . therefore, we decided to estimate vector titer in two independent ways. the functional titer was estimated by transducing 293t cells with limited dilutions of vector stocks. the proportion of gfp expressing cells was then estimated and transductions containing around 10% gfp expressing cells were used to calculate a functional titer. a relative dna titer was measured by quantifying the level of viral dna relative to endogenous genomic dna by performing real-time pcr on dna from transduced 293t cells.

the vector carrying a single copy of the  <dig> ×  <dig> bp doublet  was produced at a similar functional titer as the control vectors  . however, the titer of our vector carrying the  <dig>  kb  insulator in the ltr was significantly reduced  more than 6-fold  which is in agreement with what we have reported previously with a similar design lacking the cppt <cit> . in addition, the functional titer of the cmv vector carrying double copies of the  <dig> ×  <dig> bp element  was significantly  reduced almost 20-fold  compared to the control vector . the same was true for the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp.ef1α vector where the functional titer was reduced almost 28-fold . interestingly, such a dramatic reduction in the relative dna titer could not be observed, where only the titer of d <dig> ×  <dig> bp.ef1α was significantly reduced .

in order to analyse if the discrepancy between functional titer and relative dna titer of d <dig> ×  <dig> bp and  <dig>  kb.cmv vectors was due to loss of the transcriptional cassette by homologous recombination during the transduction process, we transduced 293t cells with the four vectors carrying the cmv promoter . dna was harvested at  <dig> days post-transduction, and real-time pcr was performed using four sets of primers  to determine the abundance of each of the different sequences in relation to each other. the lv2-primer was used as reference. at this late time-point post transduction we expected that potential episome-like structures would be diluted out due to cell division and that only properly integrated viral sequences would contribute to the real-time pcr readings. we found an approximate 1:1-ratio between lv2-, gfp- and wpre-sequences in all vectors but the one carrying two copies of the insulator doublet . the latter showed a significant  decrease in the abundance of the gfp-sequence when compared to the control vector  along with an insignificant tendency that also the wpre-sequence was underrepresented . this suggests that only the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector loses the transcriptional cassette during transduction but that this happens only in a minority of integrants. such rearrangements are common in recombinant retroviral vectors with direct repeats <cit> , and our data suggest that the same might be true for some configurations of direct repeats in lentiviral vectors. however, as only a minority of the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp.cmv integrants seems to have undergone rearrangements and since the other three vectors, including the  <dig>  kb.cmv vector, were integrated in a proper configuration, rearrangements followed by loss of the transcriptional cassette do not seem to explain the discrepancy between the functional titer and the relative dna titer. finally, we found that the ratio between the qpcr readings of lv <dig> and ins was approximately 1: <dig> after transduction with the  <dig>  kb.cmv vector compared to 1: <dig> in plasmid dna , showing that the full length  <dig>  kb insulator is efficiently duplicated during reverse transcription.

real-time pcr data showing the abundance of four sequences  present in the viral vectors. 293t cells were transduced at moi  <dig>  and after  <dig> days cells were harvested and analysed. abundance of sequences detected with primer pairs gfp, wpre and ins was calculated using lv <dig> primers as reference. for cmv.sin and s <dig> ×  <dig> bp.cmv the ratio between lv <dig>  gfp and wpre was approximately 1:1: <dig> as expected. with respect to the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp.cmv vector the ratio was roughly 1: <dig> : <dig> , which indicate that the gfp sequence is less abundant in cell cultures transduced with this vector . this suggests that the vector undergoes some degree of rearrangement during production, reverse transcription or integration. in contrast, the  <dig>  kb.cmv vector did not show any sign of rearrangements, as the ratio of lv <dig>  gfp, wpre and ins was approximately 1:1:1: <dig> when measuring on genomic dna of transduced cells. in addition, the ratio between lv <dig> and ins was 1: <dig> when measuring on  <dig>  kb.cmv plasmid dna as expected. significance is denoted by *.

in summary, the two different ways of titration and the analysis of possible vector rearrangement suggest that the vectors containing two separated copies of the insulator in the reversed transcribed form  are fully functional and that the transgene expression from these vectors appears to be reduced compared to control vectors .

transgene expression
to determine the influence of the insulator elements on transgene expression three different cell-types of different lineages were transduced with the lentiviral vectors at a multiplicity of infection  of  <dig> and  <dig> based on the relative dna titer. the use of the relative dna titer, which is not based on transgene expression capability during titration, allows comparison between different vector designs. for these experiments we used human 293t cells, which are derived from embryonic kidney, rn33b, which are immortalized rat neural precursor cells, and k <dig>  which are human erythroid progenitor cells. the transduced cells were passaged for  <dig> days and then transgene expression  was determined by flow cytometry. the neural stem cell line, rn33b, was in a separate experiment also differentiated in vitro for  <dig> days.

when transducing the cell lines with the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vectors, we found less gpf-positive cells and lower mean fluorescence  independent of cell type and promoter choice when comparing with control vectors , which suggests that the chs <dig> core element fails to increase transgene expression. in addition, the insulator was unable to prevent transgene silencing during differentiation of rn33b cells . this is in agreement with recent results showing that the  <dig> bp core element of the chs4-insulator is insufficient for insulating properties in a retroviral and lentiviral context <cit> . surprisingly, however, qpcr analyses of the proviral load in transduced cell cultures revealed significantly lower levels of viral dna in cultures transduced with the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vectors compared to control vectors , despite the fact that we had normalized the various transductions using the relative dna titer. this difference in viral dna accounted for most of the difference in transgene expression. this is surprising since we have previously used the relative dna titer for titer determination of vectors with another commonly used cis-element, the scaffold attachment region  <cit> , and subsequently found complete agreement between the proviral loads of cell cultures transduced with the vector containing this cis-element and the control vector ). in addition, these data confirm that the negative effects on vector functionality observed when inserting the  <dig> ×  <dig> bp doublet after the wpre are not caused by the size increment of the vector, since the insertion of the sar element, which is similar in size compared to the  <dig> ×  <dig> bp doublet, in this position does not influence the functional titer, the relative dna titer, transgene expression levels or proviral loads of transduced cultures. thus the reduced transgene expression from the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vectors probably reflects impaired vector functionality with regard to cell entry, integration etc, and this might explain the observed discrepancies between the functional titer and the relative dna titer.

double copies of insulators result in less proviral integrants
one explanation of the overestimation of titer when using relative dna titration of the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp and  <dig>  kb.cmv vectors could be that these configurations of insulator sequences have a deleterious effect on vector functionality at a stage after reverse transcription . using real-time pcr to quantify viral dna detects not only viral dna that is properly integrated but also viral dna that remains non-integrated. if such non-integrated viral dna was abundant in cell cultures transduced with the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp and the  <dig>  kb.cmv vectors, titer determination using real-time pcr  <dig> days after transduction would overestimate the titers, compared to titer determination conducted  <dig> days post-transduction, where non-integrated viral dna will be more diluted due to ongoing cell division. in this study titer determination was performed  <dig> days post transduction where all viral integration has normally occurred <cit> , whereas viral dna levels in the expression analyses were measured  <dig> days post transduction. a similar overestimation of the functional titer is unlikely to happen if the non-integrated viral dna is present in a form not suitable for transgene expression, since only properly integrated and transgene expressing vector genomes will contribute to this titer determination. these circumstances could explain the inconsistent relationship between the relative and the functional titer and the proviral loads measured in the expression analyses of the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp and the  <dig>  kb.cmv vectors.

to test this hypothesis we transduced 293t cells at moi  <dig>  with the four cmv vectors. cells were passaged and part of each cell culture was harvested at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  real-time pcr  on dna isolated from these cells revealed that the proviral load was significantly  decreased in cells transduced with the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector and the  <dig>  kb vector during day 3– <dig>  . after the initial drop the proviral load stayed a constant low level for at least  <dig> days . in vectors containing none or only one insulator-doublet in the reverse transcribed form  no such drop was observed . these results support the hypothesis that lentiviral vectors carrying two separated copies of the chs <dig> insulator in the reverse transcribed form are capable of efficient cell-entry and subsequent reverse transcription , but that the transduction process is impaired at some step after reverse transcription but before integration . notably, the insulator sequence itself is not deleterious to the vector since we could not detect any decrease in viral load of the s <dig> ×  <dig> bp.cmv vector from day  <dig> to  <dig> . the same was true for our vector containing the sar element confirming that loss of viral dna from day 3– <dig> was not attributable to the size increment of the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector ). it is possible that two identical insulator sequences separated by an appropriate spacing as in the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp.cmv vector and the reversed transcribed form of the  <dig>  kb.cmv vector induce the formation of secondary structure incompatible with proper transduction and transgene expression.

non-integrating vectors prevent efficient transduction
our results with the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vectors suggest that the low titer is due to several independent defects. as shown above, a large proportion of the vectors are unable to integrate and express the transgene. furthermore, a minor proportion of the vectors that integrate will have lost the transgene cassette due to vector rearrangements. however, it is worth pointing out that in contrast to oncoretroviral vectors with a similar design functional particles are produced <cit> .

to test the transduction potential of these remaining functional vectors, we transduced rn33b cells at an moi of  <dig> and  <dig>  this time based on the functional titers. at  <dig> days after transduction cells were harvested and flow cytometry performed. for the cmv vectors at a moi of  <dig>  the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector seemed to perform as well as the control vector . however, at high moi, the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector expressed gfp at a much lower level than the control vector . when using ef1α vectors the performance of the d <dig> ×  <dig> bp vector was even worse compared to the control vector .

we then transduced the neural stem cell line rn33b with increasing doses of lentiviral vectors  based on functional titer. at low mois the difference in expression between control vectors and insulator vectors was relatively small both with regard to the number of gfp positive cells and the fluorescence intensity . however, at higher mois the dose-response curve of the insulator vectors reached plateau at a lower number of transduced cells and lower fluorescence intensity . as to why this reduced expression is due to a block in the transduction pathway remains uncertain, but nonetheless efficient transduction and high levels of transgene expression from these vectors seem difficult to achieve.

discussion
the original intention of this study was to analyse the effects of a chromatin insulator on transgene expression when inserted into lentiviral vectors. the idea was to use a set-up that was independent of any type of selection and that would allow us to study potential insulator effects in cells with multiple integrants. up to date most studies using insulator sequences in retroviral or lentiviral settings have relied on drug selection of transgene expressing cells <cit> . furthermore, most studies have been designed so that only cells with single copy integrants have been analysed <cit> . such settings have little in common with clinical gene therapy protocols. in order to perform a non-selection based experiment we decided to titer the vectors using real-time pcr on dna from transduced cells. this protocol has the advantage that it does not rely on transgene expression in order to quantify the titer of the vector preparation and allows a non-biased quantification of integrating particles. when using standard lentiviral vectors without or with only one insulator element we found highly reproducible results with this non-selection based strategy. however, when we tried to apply our non-biased strategy onto vectors containing two separated copies of the chs <dig> insulator in the reversed transcribed form, we found that the dna titration led to overestimation of the titer, supposedly because of the formation of secondary structure that is incompatible with efficient transduction. this block appears to take place in a step during transduction that is after reverse transcription but before integration. how this block of integration is established is unknown but it is possible that potential secondary structures, caused by the double copies of the insulator, impede proper formation and function of the pre-integration complex  e.g. by preventing correct alignment of the integrase to the integrase binding sites or by hampering proper trafficking of the viral genome to the nucleus after infection. however, several recent reports demonstrate efficient transgene expression from non-integrating lentiviral vectors present as classical 1-ltr or 2-ltr circles <cit> . these studies describe long-term expression in post-mitotic cells at levels comparable to integrating vectors. since we show reduced expression from double copy insulator vectors, the non-integrated vector copies that we demonstrate must exist in a different form incompatible with transgene expression.

these results have important consequences for the use of insulator sequences in lentiviral vectors. it has been suggested that insulators need to be present in double or more copies in order to be fully functional <cit> . this has led to the suggestion that insulators form a loop-structure that is resistant to influences from surrounding chromatin. however, lentiviral and retroviral vectors carrying such double copies have been reported by several groups to be produced in low titer <cit> . as we demonstrate in this study that phenomenon is due to a block during the infectious process, and, importantly, this seems to prevent efficient transduction. when target cells were transduced with increasing doses of vector, the resulting dose-response curve reached a plateau at a lower number of transduced cells and with a markedly reduced mean fluorescence compared to control vectors. this suggests that efficient transduction of difficult target cells such as primary cells will be compromised with this kind of insulator vectors, which will hamper their use in both ex vivo and in vivo gene therapy settings.

we and others have seen only a modest effect on transgene expression when using insulators in lentiviral vectors <cit> . on the contrary, there appears to be strong positive effects when using more simple retroviral vectors such as those based on mlv <cit> , and it is likely that the effects of an insulator will be dependent on the context, i.e. mlv contra lentiviral vectors. mlv-based and lentiviral vectors have different integration patterns. while mlv vectors preferentially integrate near the promoter region, the hiv-based vectors appear to integrate into the entire intragenic region <cit> . it is not certain how these differences in integration sites affect transgene expression or the appearance of insertional mutagenesis. however, recent experiments in a tumorigenic mouse model show that self-inactivating lentiviral vectors have low genotoxicity compared to ltr-driven mlv vectors suggesting an enhanced safety profile of such lentiviral vectors <cit> . furthermore, lentiviral vectors appear to escape transgenic silencing more efficiently than mlv vectors. an example of this is the establishment of transgenic animals using lentiviral vectors <cit> , although several examples of lentiviral silencing in the generation of transgenic animals have also been reported <cit> .

other cis-elements that have successfully been used to enhance transgene expression from lentiviral vectors have been identified, e.g. scaffold or matrix attachment regions . these are a+t rich elements that have been suggested to be involved in the anchoring of the chromatin to the nuclear scaffold resulting in the formation of chromatin loops thereby avoiding gene silencing <cit> , and elements that have shown to prevent transgene silencing in a lentiviral context have been derived from the human interferon-β gene, the human immunoglobulin μ heavy-chain locus, the immunoglobulin κ, etc <cit> . furthermore, the use of s/mar in combination with insulators have been shown to be highly effective in enhancing transgene expression from lentiviral vectors <cit> . however, the effect of the s/mar elements appears, in most cases, to be tissue specific , which limits their general application, and identification of s/mar elements active in neural cells will be important for gene therapeutic applications in the brain. improving lentiviral vector characteristics with insulators or other cis-elements is therefore still an area of interest.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion our results demonstrate that insulator sequences can be incorporated into lentiviral vectors either in the ltr or flanking the transgene cassette. however, when double copies are used these vectors have a reduced functionality due to a block during the infectious process, and consequently such vectors transduce target cells poorly. therefore, a careful analysis of the optimal design must be performed before insulators are included into clinical lentiviral vectors. furthermore, it still remains to be proven that insulator sequences actually improve the safety profile of lentiviral vectors.
