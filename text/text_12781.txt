BACKGROUND
iridoviruses are nuclear and cytoplasmic large dna viruses , which infect invertebrates and poikilothermic vertebrates, such as insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles, crustaceans and mollusks  <cit> . the serious systemic diseases caused by some members of the iridoviridae family have made an important impact on modern aquaculture and wildlife conservation. the current members of the family iridoviridae can be divided into five genera: ranavirus, lymphocystivirus, megalocytivirus, iridovirus and chloriridovirus  <cit> . typical characteristics of all iridoviruses include the icosahedral viral particles  present in the cytoplasm; also, the iridovirus genomes are circularly permuted and terminally redundant  <cit> . at present  <dig> iridovirus agents isolated from amphibians, fish and insects have been sequenced completely. these include lymphocystis disease virus  <dig> , chilo iridescent virus , tiger frog virus , infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus , singapore grouper iridovirus , frog virus  <dig> , lymphocystis disease virus china , grouper iridovirus , ambystoma tigrinum virus , rock bream iridovirus , red sea bream iridovirus , orange-spotted grouper iridovirus  and invertebrate iridescent virus  <dig>   <cit> .

soft-shelled turtle iridovirus , the causative agent of a novel viral disease called 'red neck disease' in the farmed soft-shelled turtle  in china was first reported in  <dig>  <cit> . the virus could be propagated in several fish cell lines and caused an obvious cytopathogenic effect . to our knowledge, although several iridovirus-like agents from reptiles such as turtles have been isolated, no genomic information on a reptile iridovirus has been reported  <cit> . to facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanism of reptile iridovirus pathogenesis, we determined the complete genomic sequence of stiv and compared its genome structure with other sequenced iridoviruses to help determine its taxonomic position and evolutionary status.

RESULTS
features of the stiv genome
the determination of the stiv complete genome sequence was carried out by  <dig> life sciences technology as described  <cit> . about  <dig>  million bp were sequenced, covering nearly 20-fold of the stiv genome sequence. the individual sequences were assembled into a continuous sequence using gs de novo assembler software . the results indicated that the complete stiv genome consists of  <dig>  <dig> bp with  <dig> % identity to the complete fv <dig> genome. the g+c content of stiv is  <dig> % . computer assisted analysis revealed  <dig> potential open reading frames , which encode polypeptides ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  amino acids. the locations, orientations, sizes and blastp results for the putative orfs are shown in table  <dig>  forty-two individual putative gene products showed significant homology to functionally characterized proteins of other species. forty-nine orfs with unknown function have orthologs in other sequenced iridovirus genomes and  <dig> orfs share no homology with other iridovirus genes. seven orfs  that partially overlapped with others are not annotated as orfs in the fv <dig> genome. the other seven orfs  have corresponding orthologs in the fv <dig> genome, but their annotations were missed in analysis  <cit> . the reconstructed common ancestor of the ncldvs had at least  <dig> genes  <cit> , whereas in the stiv genome only  <dig> putative protein products shared homology with the ancestral proteins of ncldvs, including proteins involved in viral dna replication, transcription, virion packaging and morphogenesis . in addition, a few noncoding regions were identified in the stiv genome and this feature is similar to fv <dig>  in these regions,  <dig> micrornas were predicted and are described in detail below.

repetitive sequences
repetitive sequences are not only found in eukaryotic genomes  <cit> , but have also been identified in large dna viruses, where they are involved in genome replication and gene transcription  <cit> . similar to other iridoviruses, the stiv genome contains  <dig> repeat sequences . interestingly, a  <dig> tandem repeated ca dinucleotide called microsatellite or simple sequence repeat  was closely associated with a predicted gene encoding for a ring finger protein  in the stiv genome. such a repeat sequence has only been reported in the fv <dig> genome, but not in other sequenced iridoviruses or mammalian large dna viruses. these ssrs could serve to modify viral genes involved in gene regulation, transcription and protein function and modification in their function mainly depends on the number of repeats  <cit> . the biological functions of the repeat sequences and the ca dinucleotide microsatellite in stiv remain to be characterized.

dna replication and repair
stiv encodes a protein  similar to family b dna polymerases, which contains a nucleotide-polymerizing domain fused to an n-terminal exonuclease domain. in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, dna polymerase is an essential replication enzyme and is able to proofread misincorporated nucleotides as well as replicate dna  <cit> . besides these functions, the poxvirus dna polymerases could also play critical roles in catalyzing concatemer formation and promoting virus recombination  <cit> . some viruses, such as baculoviruses and poxviruses, not only exploit the host cell proliferating cell nuclear antigen  proteins to contribute to viral dna replication  <cit> , but also encode pcna-like genes by themselves  <cit> . a homolog of pcna was identified in stiv. stiv also encodes a homologue of the poxvirus d <dig> family proteins  that contains a unique d5n domain and belongs to the helicase superfamily iii within the aaa+ atpase class  <cit> . the highly conserved d <dig> protein is required for the viral dna replication or lagging-strand synthesis  <cit> .

other putative proteins encoded by stiv with known or presumed functions in viral dna replication, recombination and repair included thymidine kinase , virion packaging atpase , helicase  and tyrosine kinase  as well as flap endonuclease  with a conserved nuclease domain . the flap endonuclease homologs are not only present in stiv and other iridoviruses, but also in the poxvirus, ascovirus and mimivirus  <cit> . interestingly, flap endonuclease homologs have been identified in herpesviruses and shown to destabilize preexisting host mrnas in infected cells  <cit> . thus, the protein product of orf100r might function in stiv virogenesis.

proteins involved in transcription
the gene products involved in transcription include two dna-dependent rna polymerase subunits , transcription factor-like proteins , transcription elongation factor s-ii/tfiis  and a putative nif/nli interacting factor containing a ctd phosphatase domain . the dna-dependent rna polymerases  are multifunctional enzymes and exist ubiquitously in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and cytoplasmic dna viruses  <cit> . the putative protein encoded by orf088r contains a c2c <dig> zinc finger domain and is homologous to the tfiis, which is ubiquitous in many organisms and plays an important role in transcript elongation  <cit> . virally encoded tfiis regulate the elongation potential of the viral rna polymerase during vaccinia virus infection  <cit> .

nucleotide metabolism
four proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism were predicted in the stiv genome, including the large and small subunits of the ribonucleotide reductase , deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase  and rnase iii . viral rnr is either required for virus growth or is involved in anti-apoptosis functions during viral pathogenesis  <cit> . a putative dutpase homolog encoded by orf066r contains five conserved motifs and a conserved tyr residue as the substrate binding site. dutpase is an essential enzyme and plays multiple cellular roles  <cit> . in cells infected with epstein-barr virus, virally encoded dutpase homologs function as highly specific enzymes for efficient replication, or serve to upregulate several proinflammatory cytokines  <cit> .

stiv orf087l also contains a well-conserved rnase iii catalytic domain that is required for the cleavage of double stranded rna templates  <cit> . nearly all stiv encoded nucleotide metabolism enzymes have orthologs in other large dna viruses. this is consistent with the view that the frequent acquisition of nucleotide metabolism enzymes during dna virus evolution appears to reflect specific adaptations of viruses for the different types of cells in which they propagate  <cit> .

structural proteins
despite the emerging information about iridovirus genomes, there has been little focus on the roles of structural proteins in viral pathogenesis. three putative structural proteins were examined in the stiv genome. orf096r encodes a major capsid protein  <dig> amino acids long that shares 99% identity to fv <dig>  similar to the mcp gene, the two other genes, orf002l and orf055r, are also highly conserved in all sequenced iridovirus genomes  <cit> . orf002l encodes a putative membrane protein with a poxvirus conserved region and a c-terminal transmembrane domain. in addition, orf055r is a myristylated membrane protein homolog with two adjacent transmembrane domains and a conserved sequence m-g-x-x-x- for n-terminal glycine myristylation. the myristylated membrane protein encoded by vaccinia virus plays a role in virus assembly  <cit> . the roles of the two putative membrane proteins of stiv during viral infection need to be evaluated.

virus-host interactions
in addition to the essential genes required for virus replication, stiv also contains several putative genes involved in host-virus interactions, especially in immune evasion. stiv orf054r shares 40% identity with the vaccinia virus 3-beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase-like protein , which has been suggested to contribute to virulence by suppressing inflammatory responses  <cit> . in addition, three proteins that might be involved in apoptotic signaling have also been identified: orf067r encodes a protein containing caspase recruitment domain  and orf082l encodes a protein sharing sequence homology with the lipopolysaccharide induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha  of viruses and eukaryotes  <cit> . there is also a bcl-2-like protein  containing bh <dig>  bh <dig> domains and a typical 'nwgr' signature motif. bcl- <dig> homologs are also found in herpesviruses, poxvirus, african swine fever virus  and adenoviruses  <cit> . considering that several iridovirus agents can induce apoptosis during infection, and that virally induced apoptosis aids the progression of replication and dissemination  <cit> , these apoptosis-regulating genes might manipulate the balance of life and death in stiv infected cells. in addition, the virally encoded eif-2α decoy could inhibit eif-2α phosphorylation and block interferon action during virus infections. interestingly, stiv orf030r also displays a truncated eif-2α-like protein as well as fv <dig> orf026r, which is different from the complete eif-2α homologs conserved among eukaryotes and other viruses, suggesting that stiv and fv <dig> are likely isolates of the same viral species.

noncoding rnas
micrornas  are key regulators of gene expression in higher eukaryotes. recently, mirnas have been identified from viruses with double-stranded dna genomes. the computational method has been applied successfully to predict mirnas encoded by herpes simplex virus  <dig> and human cytomegalovirus  <cit> . we applied the same algorithm to the stiv genome and searched for 21-nucleotide  sequences with hairpin-structured precursors. twelve precursor sequences encoding  <dig> mirna candidates were identified in the stiv genome . micrornas of mammalian viruses play important roles during infection, such as repressing host immune responses and apoptosis, and regulating gene expression  <cit> . whether the potential mirnas are functional in stiv needs further investigation.

global pairwise alignment and core gene order comparisons
dna dot matrix  analyses of stiv complete genomic sequence with the fv <dig>  tfv, atv, sgiv, giv , lcdv- <dig>  lcdv-c, isknv and civ genome sequences  revealed that stiv has a high degree of sequence conservation and colinearity with fv <dig>  a slight break was also present when stiv is compared to tfv. interestingly, stiv have little colinearity with the fish iridoviruses, sgiv and giv, the second group of genus ranavirus.

we also examined the arrangement of  <dig> conserved genes, including the major capsid protein and other proteins involved in genome replication, transcription and modification. given that the origin of virus genome replication is unclear, the mcp gene was chosen as the starting point for all iridovirus genomes. as shown in figure  <dig>  stiv has a gene order in common with fv <dig> and tfv, but shows obvious differences from atv, sgiv and giv. in addition, the orders of these genes are significantly discriminative among different genera. the presence of inversion in atv and different gene arrangements are consistent with the high recombination frequency in iridoviruses.

phylogenetic analysis
to test the phylogenetic relationship of stiv with other members of iridoviruses, the full-length protein sequences encoded by four conserved core genes, including the major capsid protein , a myristilated membrane protein, ribonuclease iii and dna polymerase  were used for phylogenetic analysis. the alignments were performed using clustalx and the unweighted parsimony bootstrap consensus tree was obtained by heuristic search with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. as shown in figure 4a, the results from four phylogenetic trees provided consistent evidence that stiv is most closely related to fv <dig>  the typical species of the genus ranavirus, followed by tfv, atv, sgiv and giv.

furthermore, given the significant difference in the genome length between vertebrate and invertebrate iridoviruses, a phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genomes of  <dig> sequenced vertebrate iridovirus isolates was performed. the results further suggested that stiv is most closely related to fv <dig> . given the nature of virus-host coevolution and the phylogenetic relationships among vertebrates from fish to reptiles, we propose that the iridovirus might transmit between reptiles and amphibians, and that stiv and fv <dig> are strains of the same viral species belonging to the ranavirus genus of family iridoviridae. interclass infections of iridovirus have been observed by in vivo and in vitro studies on sympatric species of fish and amphibians that can be infected by the same virus  <cit> . whether the stiv infects frogs and fv <dig> infects turtles are questions that need to be evaluated.

gene gain and loss in the iridoviridae family
during virus-host coevolution, gene gain and loss are likely to have host-specific effects. the acquired genes could contribute to the evasion of host defenses, while the lost genes may coincide with either the loss of an antigenic signal to the host cell immune system or the gain of virulence  <cit> . to better understand the evolution of gene content in the iridoviridae family, we analyzed the gene gain and loss events among the  <dig> sequenced iridovirus agents. according to our strict homology definition, only  <dig> clusters of orthologous groups  contained a homolog from all the iridovirus isolates. several previously defined conserved core genes were excluded, including the putative replication factor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen -like proteins. these genes shared additional homology characteristics such as a predicted conserved domain, but showed poor alignment scores. we generated a phylogenetic tree based on these  <dig> concatenated proteins showing the number of genes gained and lost at each branch. as shown in figure  <dig>  although our mapping of gene gain and loss assumes that gene loss could occur throughout the tree, reptile ranavirus and amphibian ranavirus  have less gene gain-and-loss events than fish ranavirus , fish lymphocystivirus , fish megalocytivirus  and insect iridovirus . the variance among ranaviruses supported the point that sgiv and giv were classified into the second ranavirus group. moreover, both stiv and fv <dig> gained five and lost four genes compared with tfv during evolution, again suggesting that stiv shares the highest identity with fv <dig>  in addition, a number of cogs were only present within a specific genus. tumor necrosis factor receptor  homologs or tnfr-associated proteins were gained in fish iridovirus and lost in amphibian and reptile iridoviruses, while dna topoisomerase ii, nad-dependent dna ligase, sf <dig> helicase, inhibitor of apoptosis protein  and baculovirus repeated open reading frame  were lost in vertebrate iridoviruses. these genes might have contributed greatly in favoring adaptation to different natural host species during iridovirus-host co-evolution.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present study provided the complete genome sequence of turtle iridovirus. the phylogenetic tree and dot plot analyses suggested that stiv, a novel reptile iridovirus isolate, and fv <dig> are strains of the same virus species belonging to the genus ranavirus in the family iridoviridae. the genome data will not only contribute to better understanding the reptile iridovirus pathogenesis, but also shed light on the evolution of the different iridovirus isolates.
