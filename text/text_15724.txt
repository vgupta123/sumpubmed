BACKGROUND
the formation and maintenance of the skeleton involves the specification and differentiation of specialized cell types, such as the osteoblasts, chondrocytes and osteoclasts  <cit> . the osteoblasts, of mesenchymal origin, are responsible for depositing the mineralized extracellular matrix of the bones. their proliferation, survival, and physiology depend on a complex interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic signals. for example, if osteoblasts receive too few bmp signals, or if they fail to express the runx <dig> and osterix transcription factors, their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts is largely compromised or abolished  <cit> . runx <dig> was the first transcription factor identified as being essential for osteoblastogenesis  <cit> . it was later shown to act redundantly with its paralogue runx <dig> during chondrogenesis  <cit> . runx <dig> can either activate or repress transcription, depending on the nature of its cofactors, and on the regulatory architecture of the target promoter . although runx <dig> has mainly been studied in mammals, we know that it is also expressed in chondrocytes and osteoblasts during the skeletogenesis of birds, frogs, teleost fishes and sharks  <cit> . in addition, morpholino knock-down approaches have demonstrated that runx <dig> is required during chondrogenesis of danio rerio and xenopus tropicalis  <cit> . taken together, these studies reveal a broad conservation of runx <dig> function throughout osteichthyan vertebrates, a monophyletic group consisting of actinopterygians  and sarcopterygians  <cit> .

mammalian osteoblast specification and differentiation also rely on the activity of other transcription factors such as the vitamin d receptor  that belongs to the nr1i family of nuclear receptors  <cit> . the vdr is required for normal bone formation and regulates the transcription of target genes upon binding to its ligand, the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit> . in the intestine, vdr and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> play a pivotal role in the maintenance of bone mineralization and skeletal development through the regulation of proper calcium and phosphate absorption  <cit> . importantly, the cell-autonomous contribution of vdr to osteoblastic differentiation has been demonstrated by several additional lines of evidence. first, the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> enhances osteoblastic differentiation and stimulates the expression of vdr target genes coding for bone matrix components  <cit> . second, osteoblasts express the vitamin d receptor and also have the ability to synthesize 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit> . third, cultures of primary osteoblasts harvested from a vdr knock-out mouse clearly exhibit a reduced mineralization potential  <cit> . finally, the direct binding of the vdr to the promoters of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin  and bone sialoprotein  is required for chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation induced by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit> . in this respect, it is relevant to note that the direct protein-protein interaction between vdr and runx <dig> stabilizes transcriptional complexes at specific promoters, thereby contributing to osteogenesis  <cit> . in summary, a variety of experiments performed in adult tissues or in cell cultures have established vdr as an important osteoblast-specific transcription factor. however, the scarcity of developmental data and comparative studies clearly impede our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms through which vdr became incorporated in the vertebrate skeletogenic regulatory network.

indeed, changes in the regulatory interactions involved in cell specification and differentiation lie at the heart of the evolutionary process  <cit> . the functional experiments performed in mammalian osteoblasts have provided a detailed picture of the runx2-dependent regulatory network supporting skeletogenesis. they revealed how the function of runx <dig> is regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational level, and how distinct inputs converge on the runx <dig> target genes. yet, the lack of data from non-mammalian vertebrates renders difficult, if not impossible, to decipher how this skeletogenetic regulatory network emerged and evolved. in the present work, we focused our attention on a specific node of this complex network. in order to shed light on the evolutionary origin of the runx2-vdr physical and functional interaction in osteoblasts, we have compared the function, the biochemical properties, and the expression patterns of their homologues from distantly related chordates. based on our results, we propose that the three runx paralogues and vdr had the potential to functionally and physically interact in the last common ancestor of osteichthyans, and most probably did so in tissues where both proteins were expressed, in the presence of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  after the split from amphibians, in the lineage leading to amniotes, runx <dig> and vdr became robustly co-expressed in developing skeletal elements, and their regulatory interaction was incorporated in the genetic program involved in the specification and differentiation of osteoblasts.

RESULTS
several studies performed in chondrichthyans and a variety of osteichthyans have demonstrated that the runx <dig> expression in developing skeletal elements is highly conserved  <cit> . the evolution of the vdr expression pattern is, however, less clear. the vdr transcripts are known to be fairly ubiquitous in lamprey, teleost, and frog adult tissues analyzed by rt-pcr or northern blot  <cit> . because few studies have described the spatio-temporal expression pattern of vdr during embryonic development  <cit> , we decided to assess the degree of co-expression of runx <dig> and vdr during skeletogenesis of distantly related oteichthyan vertebrate such as birds, amphibians and teleosts.

vdr is robustly co-expressed with runx <dig> in the osteoblastic lineage of amniotes but not of amphibians
the fact that cell cultures of chick calvaria show vdr expression before the onset of typical osteoblastic markers suggests that vdr could be co-expressed with runx <dig> in the nuclei of osteoblastic precursors before cell differentiation and matrix mineralization  <cit> . to verify this possibility, we assessed the co-expression of runx <dig> and vdr in developing skeletal elements of gallus gallus at embryonic day  <dig> . we detected the vdr protein in the preosteoblastst present in the perichondrium as well as in the striated muscles, a situation reminiscent to what has been described in mammals   <cit> . therefore, vdr seems to be robustly expressed in the osteoblastic lineage of both intramembraneous and endochondral chick bones. to demonstrate the high degree of co-expression of the vdr and runx <dig> proteins, we examined double stainings by confocal microscopy and observed that chick preosteoblasts are significantly enriched in both proteins . we further show that in developing chick skeletal elements runx <dig> is strictly nuclear, while the vdr protein is evenly distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as expected .

because birds are closely related to mammals, we next whished to analyze the expression of vdr in a tertrapod species that does not belong to the amniota. for this purpose, we analyzed endochondral bone of the amphibian xenopus tropicalis at stage nf <dig> . immunohistochemical staining revealed a strong expression in the hindlimb skeletal muscles, showing that the vdr-specific antibody can efficiently recognize the xenopus epitope . however, in sharp contrast with the situation observed with chick embryos, no specific signal could be observed in differentiating osteoblasts of the periosteum . although we cannot rule out the possibility that the vdr is expressed below detection level in frog osteoblasts, the strong positive reaction the skeletal muscle of gallus and xenopus supports the idea that, in amphibians, the vdr protein is not present in developing endochondral bones . because the presence of mrna coding for runx <dig> has already been demonstrated in the perichondrium and periosteum of several amphibian species  <cit> , the absence of vdr in these tissues rules out the possibility of a functional interaction between the two proteins.

the teleost vdr and runx <dig> are co-expressed in some skeletal elements
in order to examine if runx <dig> and vdr are co-expressed to some degree in developing skeletal elements of teleosts, we analyzed embryos from danio rerio . we first used rt-pcr to describe the temporal expression pattern of the danio vdr gene, and revealed a maternal expression, the absence of transcripts in  <dig> hours post fertilization  larvae, and the presence of zygotic transcripts from  <dig> hpf onward . we next compared the expression pattern of runx <dig> and vdr in  <dig> hpf larvae because at this stage both genes are expressed, and skeletal elements are actively developing  <cit> . as a result of a genomic duplication event that occurred in the teleost lineage, danio rerio possesses two highly conserved runx <dig> paralogues, named runx2a and runx2b  <cit> . we employed an in situ hybridization probe containing the complete open reading frame of runx2b that is likely to also anneal to runx2a transcripts  <cit> . in this respect, it is important to stress out that at  <dig> hpf the expression pattern of runx2a only represents a fraction of the runx2b positive cells  <cit> . we found that the expression patterns of runx2b and vdr differed in several respects. for instance, at this stage , runx2b but not vdr transcripts are detected in the cleithrum, the fourth and fith branchial arches and quadrate . conversely, vdr but not runx2b transcripts are detected in the inner plexiform layer  and ventricle  . most importantly, we also detected the presence of both mrnas in several bones of the skull, such as the meckel cartilage , parasphenoid, palatoquadrate , and operculum .

altogether, these results reveal a clear difference between amniotes and other vertebrate species. while birds and mammals consistently show a robust co-localization of runx <dig> and vdr in cells of the osteoblast lineage, these two proteins do not seem to be co-expressed in amphibian long bones, and the runx <dig> and vdr transcripts only partially overlap in skeletal elements of teleost fishes.

the teleost runx2b interacts with the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> signaling pathway in mammalian osteoblasts
the co-expression of vdr and runx <dig> homologues in some skeletal elements of teleost embryos raises the possibility that danio rerio runx <dig> protein can functionally interact with the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> signaling pathway in differentiating osteoblasts. hence, we asked if the transcriptional activity of a teleost runx <dig> homologue is sensitive to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  for this purpose, we used cultures of the rat ros17/ <dig>  osteoblastic cell line known to increase the expression of osteoblast-specific genes in response to 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  in these cells, the ocn promoter directly responds to the mammalian runx <dig> protein, and this induction is further increased by the addition of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit> . we found that the overexpression of the danio rerio runx2b stimulates the expression of a mammalian ocn reporter gene , a response that is further enhanced by 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> treatment . the magnitude of this effect was similar to control transfections performed in parallel with the mouse runx <dig> homologue . this functional interaction suggests that the exogenous teleost runx2b protein can physically interact with vdr-containing macromolecular complexes regulating the transcription of osteoblast-specific target genes. in agreement with this idea, we found that a gst fusion form of the danio rerio runx2b orthologue is able to interact with the endogenous mammalian vdr obtained from nuclear extracts of immortalized rat osteoblasts . likewise, in this assay, the three mammalian runx paralogues are able to interact with vdr .

the direct runx2-vdr interaction is conserved between mammals and teleosts but not between mammals and tunicates
we subsequently used gst-pull down between purified recombinant proteins to assay the degree of evolutionary conservation of the direct physical interaction previously described between the mammalian runx <dig> and vdr  <cit> . as shown on fig. 4a, the gst-runx <dig> proteins from teleosts or mammals can interact, albeit weakly, with the mammalian vdr in vitro. we interpret the weak interaction in vitro as the requirement of additional cofactors, such as p <dig> or src <dig>  that form macromolecular complexes with the runx <dig> and vdr proteins bound to their native target genes  <cit> . hence, this result supports the idea that the ability of runx <dig> to directly interact with a mammalian vdr is well conserved between distantly related osteichthyan vertebrates. to verify if, reciprocally, the teleost vdr protein also bears the ability to directly recognize various runx <dig> homologues, we produced a recombinant form of the danio rerio vdr homologue. in gst pull down assays, the danio vdr protein is able to recognize the runx <dig> homologues from mammals and teleosts, thereby confirming that the direct runx2-vdr interaction was possible in the ancestral osteichthyan vertebrate . finally, to assess if the interaction between vdr and runx homologues is shared with invertebrates, we used an outgroup nuclear receptor from the tunicate ciona intestinalis that is most closely related to the vertebrate vdr . ci-vdr is unable to interact with the mammalian gst-runx <dig> protein . lowering the stringency of the reaction buffer did not result in any detectable interaction . taken together, these findings suggest that the runx2-vdr interaction is highly conserved between osteichthyan species, but that the invertebrate vdr orthologues are too divergent to be able to interact with vertebrate runx <dig> proteins.

discussion
with a few recent exceptions, most of our knowledge regarding the genetic basis of osteoblast specification and differentiation comes from experiments performed in mammals  <cit> . in the present study, we investigated the evolutionary origin of one component of the regulatory network involved in osteogenesis: the functional and physical interaction between the runx <dig> and vdr transcription factors  <cit> .

expression analysis revealed a clear difference between amniotes and non-amniote vertebrates. while runx <dig> and vdr are robustly co-expressed in nuclei of the osteoblastic lineage of mammals  <cit>  and birds , we found that the two proteins are unlikely to be co-expressed in amphibians and only partially overlap in skeletal elements of teleosts. this observation suggests a relatively recent recruitment of the vdr in the bones of amniotes representative . hence, although all vertebrate species possess morphologically similar cells named osteoblasts, important regulatory differences might progressively evolve in specific lineages and modify the transcriptional network controlling the specification and differentiation of this cell type. from our results it is tempting to propose that the vdr plays a direct, cell autonomous, role in all osteoblasts of amniotes, but not in amphibians . in danio rerio, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> increases mineralization  <cit> . our results suggest that this hormone regulates bone mineralization indirectly , but also cell-autonomously, in the osteoblasts of the specific skeletal elements where runx <dig> and vdr are co-expressed . a broader sampling of actinopterygian, sacrcopterygian as well as chondrichthyan species would provide valuable information regarding this issue.

using in vitro gst pull-down assays, we observed that the mammalian and teleost vdr proteins can interact with various runx homologues. in particular, the interaction is conserved with the two mammalian paralogues  and with the teleost orthologue . these experiments reveal that the interaction domains between the ancestral vdr and runx proteins were already compatible in the last common ancestor of all osteichthyan vertebrates, and have remained well conserved. in agreement with these data, we confirmed that the runx2b protein from teleosts is functional in mammalian osteoblastic cells and can be further stimulated by the addition of the vdr ligand. these results suggest that this hormone can stabilize runx2-vdr complexes on the promoter of specific target genes in teleost osteoblasts.

we failed to detect an interaction between the vdr homologue from tunicates and a vertebrate runx <dig> orthologue. in this regard, it is relevant to point out that the ci-vdr transcription factor differs from its vertebrate homologues in many other respects, as it is unable to activate reporter genes and to interact with 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>  <cit> . hence, after the split from tunicates, the ancestral vertebrate vdr underwent dramatic structural modifications, both in the c-terminal ligand-binding domain  <cit>  and in the runx2-binding domain mapped to the n-terminal region  <cit> . it is possible, but unproven, that the runx and vdr orthologues are undergoing a constant co-evolutionary process and interact together in tunicates .

in sharp contrast with the highly conserved skeleton-specific expression of runx <dig>  the transcripts and protein product of the vdr gene are detected in a broad variety of lamprey, teleost and amphibian adult organs  <cit> . one might stipulate that the functional cooperation observed between vdr and runx <dig> can be extended to the other vertebrate runx paralogues that are co-expressed with the vdr. therefore, in addition to osteoblasts, it is possible that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig> signaling directly integrates the runx-dependent regulatory networks involved in the specification of many vertebrate tissues where vdr is co-expressed with runx <dig> or runx <dig>  indeed, the fairly ubiquitous expression of the vdr might have increased its chances of being co-expressed with  any of the three runx paralogues. in this respect, it is interesting to correlate the expression of runx and vdr homologues in endodermal tissues. on the one hand, runx orthologues of nematode, sea urchin, amphioxus and mammals  are expressed in the gut  <cit> , suggesting an ancient endodermal expression inherited from the urbilateria. on the other hand, vdr is expressed in the intestine of teleosts  <cit> , lampreys  <cit> , frogs  <cit> , birds  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> . it is tempting to propose that shortly after its emergence, the vdr protein was co-expressed in the gut with runx <dig> . once the first runx-vdr regulatory interaction established, it would have been free to spread to the other runx transcription factors and their tissue-specific target genes by exaptation and regulatory rewiring  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we propose that the molecular machinery involving runx <dig> and vdr in osteoblastic cells exists at least since the emergence of the osteichthyans, but has subsequently been strengthened in the lineage leading to amniotes. the widespread vdr distribution might have facilitated the co-expression with the runx paralogues, and contributed to the emergence of the runx-vdr physical and functional interaction in a variety of tissues. osteoblasts from distantly-related vertebrate species secrete mineralized matrix and exhibit a similar morphology  <cit> . yet, in spite of these shared characters, genomic turnover continuously creates, eliminates and modifies genes coding for bone matrix proteins, a phenomenon called phenogenetic drift  <cit> . our results suggest that, likewise, the osteoblast-specific regulatory network has steadily been evolving during the vertebrate radiations. although the essential runx2-dependent regulatory kernel has remained highly conserved, it should not come as a surprise if, between species, osteoblastogenesis is modulated by a plethora of different transcription factors, signaling pathways, and ligands, such as the 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin d <dig>
