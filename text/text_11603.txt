BACKGROUND
vascular endothelial growth factor-a  plays critical roles in vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and in maintaining vascular homeostasis  <cit> . vegf functions as a mitogenic, chemotactic, and survival factor for endothelial cells, and has been shown to produce a pronounced angiogenic response in a variety of in vivo and in vitro models  <cit> . vegf also induces vascular permeability and vasodilatation, as well as activities associated with non-vascular cell targets such as hematopoietic stem cells, monocytes, osteoblasts and neurons. consistent with this wide range of important functions, deletion of even one allele of the vegf-a gene is embryonic lethal showing impaired vasculogenesis and blood island formation  <cit> . targeted inactivation of the vegf-a gene in mouse lung causes an emphysematic phenotype suggesting that vegf also plays critical roles in alveolar maintenance  <cit> . as a result of these critical activities, considerable attention has been paid to vegf as a therapeutic agent and target for disease treatment. focus has primarily been on heparin-binding vegf <dig>  however, direct vegf delivery or inactivation using blocking antibodies produces mixed outcomes indicating that the natural mechanisms of vegf control are complex and need to be better understood in order to design more effective vegf/anti-vegf therapies  <cit> .

vegf activity is principally mediated by vegf receptors   <dig> and  <dig> on vascular endothelial cells  <cit> . interactions and signaling through these receptors are also modulated by the co-receptors neuropilin   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . vegfr <dig>  is a single pass transmembrane protein with high affinity for vegf that is believed to be the major signaling receptor mediating the angiogenic activities of vegf  <cit> . the importance of vegfr <dig> is revealed by a lack of vasculogenesis and failure to develop blood islands and organized blood vessels in vegfr2-null mice resulting in death in utero  <cit> . vegfr <dig>  on the other hand, has a higher affinity for vegf but is a much less active tyrosine kinase. hence, vegfr <dig> is often thought to act as a 'decoy' receptor which functions by sequestering vegf from its signaling receptors, vegfr <dig>  <cit> . however, the wide expression of vegfr <dig> on non-endothelial cells that do not express vegfr <dig> suggests functions for vegfr <dig> that are independent of this proposed 'decoy' role. nps are cell surface glycoproteins that are proposed to function by presenting vegf <dig> to vegfr <dig>  there is no evidence that nps directly convey signals in response to vegf binding, but these co-receptors appear necessary for vegf-dependent angiogenesis  <cit>  and some signal generation  <cit> . interestingly, np- <dig> has been shown to form direct complexes with vegfr <dig> that result in decreased vegf binding to np- <dig> and vegfr <dig>  but the function of this interaction remains unclear  <cit> . together these studies suggest that the relative levels of available vegfrs and nps on the cell surface may ultimately dictate vegf response. this system is likely also influenced by the nature of the vegf present, as some vegf isoforms are unable to bind to np- <dig> or show reduced affinity as does vegf <dig> <cit> .

vegf is clearly an important regulatory protein subject to multiple levels of control. as noted above, expression of vegf receptors and co-receptors can modulate function as can the expression of vegf itself. in addition, the ability of vegf to bind to components of the extracellular matrix, mainly heparan sulfate and fibronectin, has been suggested to control access of vegf to cell surface receptors and provide a means for establishing gradients of vegf for directed angiogenesis  <cit> . in this regard, we have recently reported that neutrophil elastase  releases vegf from the extracellular matrix  by processing it to a smaller form that shows altered binding and activity  <cit> . in particular, the ne-generated vegf fragment  is unable to bind to vegfr <dig> and shows reduced binding to heparin. it is possible that inflammatory proteases modulate vegf receptor binding dynamics through the generation of vegff. thus, in the present study, we have characterized the relative binding properties of vegff to np- <dig>  ecm and fibronectin and incorporated this information into a model of vegf/vegff cell surface binding  to reveal possible mechanisms for vegf activity control. these findings suggest that the generation of vegff by ne at sites of inflammation may modulate vegf-mediated tissue repair by controlling cell surface binding events. this study highlights the complexity of the vegf-vegfr system and reveals the importance of applying system-wide analysis to identify non-intuitive insight into the mechanisms controlling ligand-receptor activation.

cell migration assay
migration assays were performed using a modified boyden chamber technique using 24-well transwell® permeable supports  with migration inserts . serum starved baec were plated onto the transwell inserts at a density of  <dig>  cells/insert in serum-free medium,  <dig> mm hepes, ph  <dig>  and  <dig> % gelatin  and placed in 24-well plates containing binding buffer +/- chemoattractant  at  <dig>  nm. the assembled plate was placed at 37°c  for the duration of the migration time . once the migration time had finished, media from the lower and upper chambers were aspirated; migrated cells were washed once in pbs without ca2+ and mg2+ ions and the cells that had migrated to the other side of the membrane were fixed with 100% pre chilled methanol for  <dig> min. cells were subsequently washed two times in pbs and the non migrated cells on the top side of the transwell membrane were swabbed using q-tips. the migrated cells were then stained by incubating in  <dig> μg/ml propidium iodide in pbs  for  <dig> min. cells were subsequently washed two times in pbs and a microsurgery knife was used to cut out the transwell membrane. the membranes were placed on labeled glass slides with migrated cells facing up. a drop of antifade component a  was placed on top of each membrane prior to covering with a glass cover slip. images of migrated cells were captured by fluorescent microscopy at six different fields/membrane at 100× magnification. the migrated cells were counted using image j nih software.

computational model development
in this paper we develop a model of vegf binding and regulation of cell surface binding by vegff . the model is based on mass-action kinetics describing binding and cell surface trafficking interactions for vegf with vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  np- <dig>  and ecm sites and builds on previous work from popel and co-workers <cit> . in the model, vegf can form a triad with vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> but not with vegfr <dig>  np- <dig> can bind vegfr <dig> in the absence of vegf but not vegfr <dig>  coupling and uncoupling rates were considered equivalent for all species and independent of vegf binding. a 1: <dig> stoichiometry of vegf to receptor or np- <dig> was maintained. heparan sulfate proteoglycans  were only explicitly included as ecm sites. synthesis was based on steady-state receptor levels and internalization rates for all species were considered equivalent except where noted. the fluid phase is considered well-stirred.

v = vegf, f = vegff, r <dig> = vegfr <dig>  r <dig> = vegfr <dig>  n = np- <dig>  e = ecm, cr <dig> = vegf-vegfr <dig>  cr <dig> = vegf-vegfr <dig>  ce = vegf-ecm, cn = vegf-np- <dig>  d = vegff-vegfr <dig>  tv = vegf-vegfr2-np- <dig> tf = vegff-vegfr1-np- <dig>  x = vegfr1-np-1

regulation of vegf binding by vegff was investigated in two ways. vegff has been shown previously to bind to vegfr <dig> with a similar affinity as vegf, but does not bind vegfr <dig> <cit> . in this paper, we provide evidence that vegff does not bind to np- <dig> or ecm sites. the model reflected these events but there is no direct evidence supporting or excluding vegff bound to vegfr <dig> from interacting with np- <dig> as shown for vegf <dig> <cit>  but not vegf. in model  <dig>  vegff was therefore able to bind vegfr <dig> and then couple with np- <dig> or bind to vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes. in model  <dig>  binding of vegff to vegfr <dig> excluded further interactions with np- <dig> and vegff was not able to bind to vegfr-np- <dig> complexes. in all other ways the models are identical.

the models are composed of a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. the equations listed below describe model  <dig>  where vegff bound to vegfr <dig> excludes any interactions between vegfr <dig> and np- <dig>  symbols are defined in tables  <dig> and  <dig>

RESULTS
elastase degrades vegf binding sites in the ecm
elastase is known to degrade ecm components including hspgs  <cit> , thus, we explored the possibility that elastase degrades vegf binding sites within the ecm. to do this, we isolated ecm from rat smooth muscle cell cultures, subjected these ecm preparations to elastase digestion and then measured vegf binding. previous studies have indicated that fibronectin is a major vegf binding site in the ecm. thus, we also investigated the possibility that elastase destroys vegf binding sites on fibronectin using polystyrene surfaces coated with fibronectin. elastase treatment of smooth muscle cell-deposited ecm or fibronectin matrices resulted in a dramatic loss of vegf binding capacity . approximately 50% loss in binding was observed with  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml elastase treatments of ecm and fibronectin respectively, while high doses of elastase  resulted in >90% loss of binding to either matrix. therefore, elastase treatment at concentrations that have previously been shown to cause growth factor release from ecm  <cit>  would be predicted to cause a loss of vegf binding sites within the ecm.

simulations indicate ecm sites have minimal impact on vegf binding to cell surface receptor
ecm sites for vegf are generally numerous but of low-affinity  <cit> . using our vegf model , we investigated how the density of ecm sites impacted vegf receptor binding using simulations. vegf  was added at time zero and the levels of vegf-vegfr <dig> and vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes were determined after three hours of simulation time . under these conditions , there was considerable retention  of vegf to both vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> with over five times as many vegfr <dig> complexes as vegfr <dig> complexes across the range of ecm density investigated. similar results were found when we looked at just surface complexes at  <dig> h instead of total complexes  or when internalization and synthesis were eliminated in simulations of 4°c binding data . these different binding levels were a consequence of the higher density of vegfr <dig> and the higher binding affinity of vegf for this receptor . the density of ecm sites had a negligible effect on vegf binding to either vegfr <dig> or vegfr <dig> except at densities greater than  <dig> sites/cell where inhibition becomes significant. this is due to the low affinity of these sites for vegf compared to vegfr <dig> or vegfr <dig>  if the affinity of the ecm site is significantly higher, the effect would be greater . at typical cell densities measured in cultures  and affinities, degradation of ecm sites would not be predicted to have a significant effect on receptor binding of vegf and would therefore be unlikely to impact cell activity.

vegf fragment exhibits negligible binding to ecm, fibronectin and neuropilin-1
we have shown, however, that the impact of elastase with regard to the vegf system is not limited to the ecm binding sites. elastase cleaves vegf to produce a smaller fragment of vegf  with cleavage sites at the c-terminal, n-terminal and internal regions that exhibits reduced binding to heparin and vegfr <dig> but retains the ability to bind vegfr <dig> <cit> . we therefore tested whether vegff bound to cell-deposited ecm. vegf bound ecm in a dose-dependent manner  while vegff exhibited negligible binding indicating that the conversion to vegff would likely impact ecm storage of the growth factor.

in related studies, we found that heparin exposure significantly increases vegf binding to fibronectin catalyzing the conversion of fibronectin to an open conformation  <cit> . thus, to more fully characterize the effects of elastase on vegf activity, we prepared vegff and assessed its binding to fibronectin ± heparin. fibronectin ± heparin was adsorbed on hydrophobic polystyrene surfaces and 125i-vegf and 125i-vegff binding measured. intact vegf showed minimal binding to fibronectin in the absence of heparin exposure but showed significantly enhanced binding to fibronectin that was previously incubated with heparin . this heparin-enhanced vegf binding was  <dig> to  <dig> fold higher compared to vegf binding to fibronectin alone over the range of vegf concentrations tested. in contrast, vegff showed no significant binding to fibronectin in the presence or absence of heparin. the lack of vegff binding to fibronectin is consistent with an overall reduced ability to bind to ecm binding sites as compared to intact vegf.

np- <dig> is a co-receptor for vegf that enhances angiogenic signaling cooperatively with vegfr <dig>  therefore we examined whether vegff was able to bind to np- <dig> and if this interaction would influence interactions with vegfr <dig>  to do so, we performed cell-free receptor binding experiments using fc-np- <dig> and fc-vegfr <dig> chimeric proteins. the chimeras were composed of the extracellular vegf binding domain of the relevant receptor fused to the fc-region of human igg <dig> via a peptide linker. 125i-vegf or 125i-vegff was incubated with fc-np- <dig>  fc-vegfr <dig> or both for 2h. bound complexes were measured after pull down with magnetic protein a beads. vegff showed no significant binding to fc-np- <dig> chimera at either concentration tested  while intact vegf bound fc-np- <dig>  indicating that elastase processing of vegf alters its ability to bind np- <dig>  previous studies have reported that np- <dig> is able to inhibit vegf binding to vegfr <dig> by potentially heterodimerizing with vegfr <dig> and preventing vegf-vegfr <dig> binding. to test whether vegff binding to vegfr <dig> is affected by the presence of np- <dig>  fc-vegfr <dig> chimeras were pre-incubated with np- <dig> prior to evaluating vegf/vegff binding. intact vegf bound to both fc-vegfr <dig> and fc-np- <dig> but the combination value was below that for fc-vegfr <dig> alone indicating no additive effect for the combination and suggesting that vegfr <dig> interactions with vegf were reduced by the presence of np- <dig> . vegff bound to fc-vegfr <dig> but not fc-np- <dig> and the addition of fc-np- <dig> had a negligible impact on vegff overall binding. this suggests that either  vegff binding to vegfr <dig> is unaffected by np- <dig> and that there is no difference in vegff affinity for vegfr <dig> alone or vegfr1-bound to np- <dig> or that  vegff binding to fc-vegfr <dig> inhibits vegfr <dig> binding to np- <dig> and that the vegff interaction is of a higher affinity than the vegfr1-np- <dig> interaction. in either case, these results suggest that the inability of vegff to bind np- <dig> is reflective of a general loss of np- <dig> control over the system. we decided to investigate how these two possibilities for vegff interactions with vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> would be predicted to impact the vegf system using computational modeling.

computational model shows that vegf fragment impacts vegf-vegfr <dig> complex levels despite not binding to vegfr2
a computational model including vegf, vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  np- <dig> and vegff was developed. in our model, vegff is able to bind vegfr <dig> with the same affinity as does vegf but it is not able to bind either vegfr <dig> or np- <dig>  our experimental results, however, were unclear regarding vegff interactions with vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes and so we investigated this question using two variations of the model. in model  <dig>  vegff can bind to vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes and vegff bound to vegfr <dig> can bind to np- <dig>  similar to vegf <dig> <cit> . in model  <dig>  vegff binding to vegfr <dig> excludes interactions between vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> entirely. with model  <dig>  there are no vegff-vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes. in the simulations, vegf  and vegff were both added at time zero and simulations run corresponding to three hours of experimental incubation. these conditions might correspond to the case where vegff has been generated from matrix-bound vegf by elastase and the vegff is now soluble and capable of impacting vegf binding downstream.

using our model, in the absence of vegff, there was greater than five times more vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes than vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes due to the increased affinity and density of vegfr <dig> . the addition of vegff reduced vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes with both model  <dig> and model  <dig> to a similar extent. vegff competes directly with vegf for binding to vegfr <dig> and so increasing the concentration of vegff resulted in an expected reduction in vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes. in contrast, the effect of vegff on vegf binding to vegfr <dig> was markedly different depending on whether vegff binding to vegfr <dig> excluded interactions with np- <dig> 

with model  <dig> , where np- <dig> can interact with vegff-vegfr <dig> complexes, even the addition of high concentrations of vegff had only a small but positive effect  on the level of vegf retained by vegfr <dig>  . in contrast, when vegff binding inhibits interactions between vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> , addition of fragment more than doubled the level of vegf retained by vegfr <dig> . the total amount of vegf retained by the cells in the presence of vegff reflects these differences in vegfr <dig> binding with model  <dig> showing only inhibition while model  <dig> showed a biphasic response. similar relative results were found when looking at surface bound only  or when synthesis and internalization were excluded from the model .

neuropilin sequestration impacts vegf-vegfr <dig> complex levels
the difference in vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes in response to vegff between the two models was striking. when we looked at the level of vegfr <dig> that was not bound to vegf, vegff or np- <dig>  we found that these levels decreased with increasing vegff until there were essentially no free vegfr <dig> with either model . in contrast, vegfr <dig> bound to np- <dig> was not significantly altered by the presence of vegff with model  <dig>  yet was dramatically reduced with model  <dig>  this reduction in vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes in model  <dig>  as a result of the binding of vegff to vegfr <dig> and the subsequent exclusion of np- <dig> from the vegfr1-np- <dig> complex, leads to an increase in np- <dig> available for vegf-vegfr <dig> stabilization. this stabilization leads to increased vegfr <dig> complexes and resulting increased total retention of vegf found with model  <dig>  as the increase vegfr <dig> binding is greater than the loss of vegfr <dig> binding in these simulations .

np- <dig> levels had a critical impact on vegf retention by vegfr <dig> . despite having an equivalent level of vegf, higher levels of np- <dig> resulted in near saturation of binding and a more than  <dig> fold increase in binding levels over that at the lowest level of np- <dig>  model  <dig> enhances vegf-vegfr <dig> levels over the lower range of np- <dig> values investigated compared to both vegf-vegfr <dig> levels with model  <dig> as well as to the situation when vegf-vegfr <dig> binding occurs in the absence of vegff . note that vegf-vegfr <dig> retention in the absence of vegff  is the same for model  <dig> and model  <dig> since the difference between the models lies only in the binding of vegff.

coupling between vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> regulates vegf-vegfr <dig> binding
the importance of the np- <dig> levels as well as the differences observed with the two vegff binding models suggest that coupling between vegfr <dig> and np- <dig> is critical to regulation of vegf-vegfr <dig> binding both in the presence or absence of vegff. in the absence of coupling between the two surface proteins , vegff had an impact  on vegf retention by vegfr <dig> . this impact was significantly decreased  when endocytosis/synthesis was not included . at our baseline coupling value , vegf binding to vegfr <dig> was decreased compared to that found in the absence of coupling  for both models, but it increased by approximately 3-fold when vegff was added for model  <dig> . at the highest vegff value, the amount of vegf retained by vegfr <dig> is the same as that found in the absence of coupling  for model  <dig>  decreasing the coupling value increases the percentage of vegf-bound vegfr <dig> while increasing the coupling value had the opposite effect. vegff had a smaller impact on the retention of vegf by vegfr <dig> with model  <dig> irrespective of the coupling rate . this impact was negligible when endocytosis/synthesis was not included . looking only at surface bound vegf-vegfr <dig> showed similar trends to that shown in figure  <dig> .

relative receptor levels and receptor-mediated endocytosis impact vegf capture
our model assumed that endocytosis was equivalent for receptors regardless of receptor occupancy. however, many ligand-receptor systems show enhanced endocytosis when ligand is bound. thus, we tested how varying the relative endocytosis rates would impact vegf-vegfr <dig> retention. as shown in figure  <dig>  increasing the rate of endocytosis for vegf-bound receptors resulted in a significant increase in vegf-vegfr <dig> retention while reducing that rate lead to an overall reduction in vegf-vegfr <dig> retention. how these differences might influence signaling however is unclear. retention includes all vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes . if one looked only at surface interactions at  <dig> hr, the opposite results would be found . at  <dig> times the baseline internalization rate , there are essentially no complexes on the surface while at the reduced internalization rate  there was essentially no internalized complexes with all vegf-vegfr <dig> being on the cell surface.

we further explored the role of receptor levels by varying the levels of vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and np- <dig>  for example, recent work has suggested that receptor levels may be much lower than np- <dig> levels in certain cells  <cit> . setting all levels to  <dig>  sites per cell, we found that vegff resulted in increased vegf-vegfr <dig> retention by cells with model  <dig> but only a small decrease with model  <dig> . increasing the levels of vegfr <dig> or vegfr <dig> resulted in a change in the retention levels but the overall trend of increasing binding with vegff for model  <dig> only was found. increasing np- <dig> levels essentially eliminated the effect of vegff on vegfr <dig> retention, further illustrating the importance of this component for vegff activity.

conversion of vegf to vegff affects cell migration
ne action on the vegf system would be predicted to cause a reduction in vegf binding sites in the ecm and the conversion of vegf to vegff. simulations indicated that the loss of ecm sites would likely have a negligible effect under standard cell culture conditions and so we focused on evaluating the effect of vegf conversion to vegff. stimulation of endothelial cell migration is a hallmark of vegf treatment and is thought to reflect a key component of vegf's biological function  <cit> . thus, we conducted experiments to evaluate whether vegff impacted this process. endothelial cells were plated on microporous transwell inserts and vegf, vegff, or combinations of the two were introduced into the lower chamber. endothelial cells did not migrate in response to vegff alone  while showing a strong migratory response after  <dig> h to vegf . combinations of vegf and vegff showed a biphasic response with 25% vegff and 75% vegf leading to a statistically significant increased response compared to 100% vegf while higher ratios of vegff led to a diminished response, a not necessarily straightforward result.

a simple increase in vegf-vegfr <dig> is not likely responsible for vegff-mediated enhanced cell migration
to evaluate various possible mechanisms for the enhanced cell migration observed when portions of vegf were substituted with vegff, simulations were performed for  <dig> h where the sum of vegf and vegff added was kept constant  such that at high vegf concentrations there are low vegff levels and at low vegf concentrations there are high vegff concentrations. these conditions might simulate a situation where there is both vegf and vegff entering a cell environment due to local conversion of vegf to vegff by ne rather than the case where excess vegff enters a cell environment. vegfr <dig>  vegfr <dig>  and np- <dig> were all set to the same value . as shown in figure 10a, with both models the conversion of vegf to vegff resulted in a reduction in vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes. even with model  <dig>  where vegff binding to vegfr <dig> releases np- <dig> for vegf-vegfr <dig> complex stabilization, the reduction in available vegf for binding to vegfr <dig> as a result of conversion to vegff is not compensated for by np-1-mediated stabilization. similarly, vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes are also reduced by the conversion of vegf to vegff in both cases.

signaling by vegff is one possible mechanism
there is evidence that vegf signaling can occur through both vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> and that some type of interplay or balance between the two may be at work. for example, we recently showed that vegf stimulates phosphorylation of both erk1/ <dig> and akt in endothelial cells while vegff addition resulted in strong phosphorylation of akt but not erk1/ <dig> <cit> . looking at vegfr <dig> binding, we find with model  <dig> an increase in complex formation  while model  <dig> shows a decrease in total vegfr <dig> complexes . this difference reflects the binding of vegff to vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes permissible with model  <dig>  np- <dig> has been shown to have a role in vegf signaling and to alter vegfr <dig> signaling  <cit> . we therefore looked at how the combined signaling potential of vegf and vegff through np- <dig> in our simulations might proceed as one possible mechanism . with model  <dig>  vegf conversion to vegff led to a very strong increase in the total amount of vegff-vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes. this counterbalanced the decrease in vegf-vegfr2-np- <dig> complexes resulted in a combined "total" that was biphasic. in contrast, model  <dig> does not allow for vegf-vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes resulting in only a decreasing vegf-vegfr2-np- <dig> "signal".

discussion
vegf has long been recognized as an endothelial cell survival factor and mitogen as well as having a role in endothelial cell migration and vessel repair. there are multiple vegf isoforms with vegf <dig>  a heparin-binding variant, being the most widely expressed in vivo. we have recently observed that neutrophil elastase can cleave vegf and generate vegff, a biologically-active fragment of vegf with altered receptor binding and activity  <cit> . unlike several of the other proteolytically processed forms of vegf, which generally involve truncation of the primary vegf polypeptide chain  <cit> , ne appears to cleave the vegf chain within internal regions in addition to the termini. in this way, vegff is held together by intra- and inter-chain disulfide bonds and shows interesting features resulting from selective alterations in its binding properties. the present paper focuses on coupling computer simulations with experimental studies to delve further into the impact of ne on the vegf network in order to gain insight on the larger question of how proteolytic damage to growth factor-laden tissues during injury and inflammation might modulate bioavailability and activity.

enzymatic processing of the extracellular matrix, a depository site for important biological molecules, can result in the release of stored growth factors thereby increasing their availability for activity. in addition, the degradation of the ecm may alter its ability to capture additional growth factors. we show this to be the case with ne and vegf. treatment of both surface-deposited fibronectin and cell-derived ecm with ne resulted in a significant decrease in vegf binding . we postulated that elastase damage to ecm might result in increased cellular vegfr binding due to a reduction in competition from the ecm sites. using simulations, however, we found that the impact was negligible unless the sites were of very high number or high affinity  . while the effect of ecm competition was negligible under the in vitro cell culture conditions used in our study, it is likely that this process would be very relevant in matrix-rich tissues in vivo where vegf is stored and binding sites are abundant such as in the lung and blood vessel wall. under those conditions, our simulations suggest that degradation of sites would have a major impact on vegf availability for receptor binding.

our studies suggest that a more important consequence of ne treatment with regard to the vegf system may be the conversion of vegf to vegff. simulations demonstrate that the presence of vegff, with its altered binding properties compared to vegf, could have a significant impact on vegf receptor binding. previously we have shown that vegff does not bind to vegfr <dig>  <cit>  and data included herein show a loss of binding to np- <dig> as well as to fibronectin . we postulated that vegff addition would result in increased vegf binding to vegfr <dig> due to a reduction in vegf-vegfr <dig> complexes as a simple consequence of vegff-vegfr <dig> binding. using simulations, however, we find that vegff can impact vegf receptor interactions in a more complex manner . when vegff binding to vegfr <dig> did not prevent vegfr <dig> interactions with np- <dig> or vegff was able to bind to vegfr <dig> bound to np- <dig> , vegff did not increase overall vegf binding to vegfr <dig> and had only a limited effect. in contrast, when vegff binding to vegfr <dig> prevented vegfr <dig> interactions with np- <dig> , vegff essentially acted as a release mechanism for the vegf-vegfr <dig> stabilizer, np- <dig>  and increased vegf interactions with vegfr <dig> were evident.

the role of vegff appears therefore to be more of an indirect regulator of vegf through np- <dig> than a direct regulator of vegf-receptor interactions. this was illustrated further by looking at the impact of np- <dig> density  and the coupling rate between np- <dig> and vegfr <dig> . this type of ternary regulation is not unique to the vegf system. many heparin-binding growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor - <dig> , form stabilizing complexes with cellular receptors and hspgs, resulting in significant enhancement of receptor activation. certainly receptors such as gp <dig> have been shown to play an important role in cytokine signaling within a number of systems making it a potentially more important system regulator than any individual component. this ternary complex regulation may also have a role in heterodimerization and cross-talk within  and between growth factor systems such as what is suggested for the igf-i and egf families  <cit> .

our original hypothesis was that elastase conversion of vegf to vegff would result in the generation of a non-stimulating form of the growth factor due to its inability to bind the major signaling receptor vegfr <dig>  both our experimental and simulation results suggest that this model is an oversimplification of this complex ligand-receptor system. vegf alone stimulates endothelial cell migration while vegff alone does not . conversion of vegf to vegff should result in increased vegff and decreased vegf with the same overall concentration of total growth factor to be found. with cell migration studies designed to test this effect, we found an increase in migration when the vegf concentration was reduced by 25% with a corresponding substitution of vegff, in contrast to what one might expect based on the results with 100% vegf and 100% vegff. further increases in vegff beyond 25% and corresponding decreases in vegf resulted in reduced migration. simulations showed that this biphasic response could not be explained simply by an increase and then decrease in vegf binding to vegfr <dig> caused by vegff addition  regardless of whether vegff bound to vegfr1-np- <dig> complexes or not.

there is however evidence that np- <dig>  <cit>  and vegfr <dig> are also involved in vegf signaling  <cit>  and may be involved in mediating the migration process. previously we found that akt but not erk 1/ <dig> was activated by vegff suggesting that this key signal pathway might be mediated through vegfr1  <cit> . using simulations, we find that under conditions where the total vegf plus vegff remains constant, vegf binding to vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> is reduced while vegff binding to vegfr <dig> is increased . further, when one focuses on np- <dig> stabilized vegf and vegff complexes, we find that, with model  <dig>  a biphasic binding situation exists with a peak sum of vegf-vegfr2-np- <dig> and vegf-vegfr1-np- <dig> at an intermediate combination of vegf and vegff. certainly this is not direct evidence but simply further illustrates how np- <dig> might be critical to the regulation of vegf-vegff activity. further experimental studies are needed to determine exact mechanisms but our simulations suggest possibilities worth exploring with regard to np- <dig>  there are also recent reports indicating that vegfr <dig> and vegfr <dig> can form heterodimers  <cit> . thus, vegff also has the potential to influence the formation of these complexes directly and through np- <dig> interactions. as experimental data become available it will be interesting to explore these additional aspects of the system to fully appreciate how its complexity can be used to produce sophisticated modes of regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that vegff, an elastase-generated product of vegf, has a biphasic impact on vegf stimulated migration and, using simulations, we postulate that this effect is via vegff-mediated vegfr <dig> stimulation. simulations suggest that vegff activity is controlled by its interactions with np- <dig> and vegfr <dig> and that release or restriction of np- <dig> controls whether enhanced vegf binding of vegfr <dig> is likely to occur. further experimental studies targeted at testing the simulation predictions are necessary to fully understand the complex mechanisms controlling vegf-signaling. moreover, these studies suggest that simulations can be a valuable means to interpreting the complexity of perturbations within a complex multi-receptor system and highlight the need for quantitative parameter measurements to obtain mechanistic understanding.
