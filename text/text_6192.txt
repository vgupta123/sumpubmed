BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphism  refers to an allelic single-base variation
between two haplotype sequences in an individual or between any paired homologous
chromosomes across homogenous members. snps are most abundant among genomic dna
variations and ubiquitous in both functional genes and non-coding regions  <cit> . because they are conserved during evolution, associated with genetic
traits, and suited for high throughput genotyping, snps are a popular and powerful
tool for various genetics and genomics studies, such as mapping of whole genomes,
tagging of important traits, comparison of genome evolution, classification of
diverse clades, and many rapidly developing areas such as pharmacogenomics and
functional proteomics  <cit> . these snps from expressed sequence tags  represent hundreds of
thousands of functional genes and likely control many genetic traits  <cit> . due to degeneracy of most three-nucleotide genetic codons, a snp in the
coding regions may be synonymous  if it does not result in change of the
protein sequence or non-synonymous  if it does. the nssnps are usually more
biologically relevant because the resulting amino acid changes in proteins may
change their secondary structures and functions and cause phenotypic mutations  <cit> .

snp discovery usually is accomplished through computational alignment of redundant
dna sequences with each other or with a high-quality reference genome where
discrepant nucleotides can be detected and evaluated. for the redundancy-based
computational approach, in addition to sequencing errors as a source of false snps  <cit> , it may be even more challenging to distinguish real snps among allelic
sequences from single nucleotide discrepancies among highly identical paralogous
sequences  <cit> . several bioinformatics programs  have been developed for
automatic snp mining, using different input data, computational algorithms, quality
evaluation strategies, and/or output formats. for example, the polyphred and
polybayes pipeline typically requires sequence trace files or extracted sequences
with base calling quality values to minimize false snps resulting from sequencing
errors  <cit> . polybayes also includes an extra implementation to identify paralogs and
their derived false snps  <cit> . others like autosnp and quailitysnp can accept sequences without quality
files for initial redundancy-based detection, and then grade snps by confidence
levels, which are more commonly used with public ests that usually do not have trace
or quality files  <cit> . the qualitysnp pipeline implements a haplotype reconstruction algorithm
and confidence scoring approach to detect reliable synonymous and non-synonymous
snps from public ests without quality files and a reference genome  <cit> . in other words, it re-clusters ests in a contig to determine the
potential haplotypes in the contig. only single discrepant nucleotides between any
two reconstructed haplotypes would be scored a potential snp. sequencing differences
can also result from sequencing errors or alignment of paralogs. only those
potential snps passing additional confidence interrogation are identified as quality
snps. reliable quality snps represent the different alleles  of a gene.
as opposed to low-confidence and false snps, the use of quality snps can benefit
allele-trait association studies  <cit> .

most citrus species are diploid , with
highly heterozygous and relatively small genomes and over  <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> . in general, citrus refers to true biological species and ancestrally
domesticated introgressions in citrus and those in the sexually compatible
fortunella  and poncirus  genera.
citrus fruit types are diverse, and include sweet orange ,
mandarin , grapefruit , lemon , lime , pummelo , and
citron . each type consists of many cultivars primarily selected
from spontaneous bud sports, chance seedlings, induced mutants, or conventional
hybrids. it is widely believed that only c. maxima, c. reticulata,
and c. medica are true species, although the binomial names for the other
ancestral hybrid and introgression cultivars are widely accepted and used  <cit> . these citrus types likely vary in levels of heterozygosity and share
alleles resulting from early introgressions across these genomes, according to ssr
markers  <cit> . a haploid clementine genome sequence was produced using sanger
technology, and one diploid sweet orange genome using roche  <dig> technology  <cit> , along many other citrus genomes using other re-sequencing platforms
. together with other available citrus genomic
resources, it is now possible for snp detection and comparison of large-volume
citrus sanger est datasets within and among different citrus cultivars. these
gene-based snps, once available for the citrus community, will be very valuable in
many genetic and genomic studies, and helpful for trait-targeted breeding as well  <cit> .

in this paper, snps in public ests from  <dig> different citrus genotypes were detected
by the qualitysnp pipeline and compared to estimate the heterozygosity of each
genome. all of the short snp oligo sequences were also aligned with the clementine
citrus genome to determine their distribution and uniqueness in the genome and for
in silico validation. selected snps were also validated by snapshot and
sequencing.

methods
citrus ests and cultivars
all citrus ests were retrieved from the national center of biotechnology
information  est database or ftp repository if available. there were 27
citrus cultivars or biotypes with ests . in addition to the binomial and
common names, the abbreviations for  <dig> cultivars were designated to facilitate
presentation ; the binomial names are those used for the accessions
in the ncbi database. ests were searched for snps using the qualitysnp pipeline  <cit>  in each of the  <dig> cultivars and in three cultivar groups, 12
mandarins ,  <dig> limes/lemons/citron , and all  <dig> cultivars . the
mining results for individual cultivars in the three groups were summed, giving
sm <dig>  sl <dig>  and sc <dig>  respectively used to compare with of m <dig>  l <dig>  and c27
. 'ridge pineapple’ sweet
orange  was selected for snp validation because the
most ests and snps are from sweet orange and it is a parent to several widely
used mapping populations.

citrus sinensis
c. clementina
c. reticulata
c. unshiu
c. limonia
c. latifolia
c. aurantifolia
c. limettioides
c. aurantium
c. paradisi
poncirus trifoliata
all ests are retrieved from the ncbi repository. those in bold font
are over  <dig>  ests. all mandarin  and lime/lemon
 types were listed together. the abbreviation for
each cultivar and total was designated to facilitate
presentation.

snp discovery and primer design
the qualitysnp pipeline was installed and used for snp discovery, following the
program manual and recommended parameters  <cit> . qualitysnp first identified haplotypes in a contig by re-clustering
its ests and extracted all nucleotide discrepancies  between identified haplotypes in a contig, from which a subset of
so-called quality snps  was identified based on allele and snp confidence
scores defined in the haplotype-based mining algorithm  <cit> . these qsnp-containing contigs and 25-mer oligo sequences, along with
much other mining information, were saved in separate files for database
construction and result summary. the ratios of qsnp/psnp were calculated to
indicate the percentage of nucleotide discrepancies  identified as
high-qaality snps  by the qualitysnp algorithm. bioinformatics programs
included in the pipeline were cross_match in the phred-phrap-consed package  <cit>  to remove vectors, cap <dig>  <cit>  to assemble ests, fasty  <cit>  to align ests to the proteins in the uniprot database for
identification of non-synonymous and synonymous snps. batchprimer <dig>  <cit>  was used to design a forward , a reverse , and a single base
extension  primer flanking each snp site. the f, r and sbe primers of 96
snps from so were selected for both sequencing and sbe genotyping validation
. after sorting by the lengths of
sbe primers, except the first, the other  <dig> primers of every  <dig> sbe primers were
tailed in the 5’ end with three groups of non-homologous polynucleotides
of different lengths to facilitate future multiplex genotyping application. all
the f, r and tailed sbe primers,  <dig> each, were synthesized by eurofins mwg
operon  in a 96-well plate, respectively, where every three
primers of each snp were placed in the same well of the three different plates
and stored in ddh2o at 10 μm. the format facilitated easy
primer positioning and channel pipetting during the genotyping and sequencing
preparation.

snp 25-nucleotide sequence blast
all 25-nucleotide oligo sequences  generated from
every citrus genotype by qualitysnp were combined together and used to align to
the haploid clementine reference genome  using blastn  <cit>  and a cut-off e-value of 6e- <dig> . each query sequence  against the subject scaffolds would yield either of the following blastn
outputs, “no hits found”,  <dig> hit on  <dig> scaffold with  <dig> alignment, or
any other cases . at the
preset e value, only alignments with 84% identities and higher ,
were saved in the blastn output file. the information in the output file,
including the scaffold, position, strand, e value, score, alignment identities
of each hit, and hit status, was parsed into an excel file to summarize snp
alignment status and to calculate distribution on the clementine reference
genome scaffolds. the information was also used as additional criteria for
categorization of snps and selection of desired core sets.

snp validation by sequencing and snapshot genotyping assay
bigdye terminator v <dig>  cycle sequencing kit and snapshot multiplex kit  were used to validate snps, following the
manufacturer’s protocols with some modifications in reaction volumes
and/or quantity of proprietary reagents. 96-well plates were used for pcr,
enzymatic incubation, and denaturation on icycler  and/or
geneamp pcr system  <dig> , and for
genotyping and sequencing on 3130xl genetic analyzer . unless otherwise stated, brief centrifugation up to 1000 rpm in
juan mr 23i was applied after addition of a solution or before implementation of
new steps, and all the pcr and enzymatic incubation programs were set to hold at
4°c indefinitely at the end until a next procedure.

for both dye terminator sequencing and snapshot assays to validate snps, template
preparation was carried out in 10 μl in each well consisting of
 <dig>  μl ddh2o,  <dig>  μl 10x dntps ,
 <dig>  μl 5x colorless gotaq flexi buffer,  <dig>  μl 25 mm
mgcl <dig>   <dig>  μl f and r primers each,
 <dig>  μl gotaq flexi , and
2 μl genomic dna . the touch-down pcr program
started from an initial denaturation at 94°c for 3 min, followed by
10 cycles of 93°c for 30 sec, 56°c for 45 sec
, 72°c for 45 sec, and 30
continuing cycles with 51°c at the annealing step, plus a final elongation
at 72°c for 15 min. removal of primers and unused dntps was performed
by addition of 1 μl of exoisap-it  into
each well of the plate, and incubation at 37°c for 60 min and
75°c for 15 min.

sequencing reactions for snp validation were prepared in 10 μl in each
well of a new plate including 2 μl 5x sequencing buffer,
2 μl ready reaction premix in the sequencing kit, 1 μl
10 μm snp f primer, and 5 μl exosap-it treated pcr product,
started at 95°c for 1 min, followed by  <dig> thermal cycles of 95°c
for 10 sec, 50°c for 5 sec, and 60°c for 4 min.
following the manufacturer’s instructions, ethanol/edta/sodium acetate
precipitation was used to purify the sequencing product in the plate, which was
subsequently air dried, then mixed with 2 μl ddh2o and
6 μl hi-di formamide in each well, denatured, and loaded to the
genetic analyzer to sequence. the sequence files generated were analyzed by
sequencing analysis software  to generate
sequences and electropherograms, in which a validated snp was confirmed by
correct alignment of sbe primer sequence into the corresponding sequences and
visualization of two different overlapped nucleotide peaks at the nucleotide
site in the electropherograms.

the sbe reaction for snapshot assays was prepared in 5 μl in each well
in a new plate including  <dig>  μl ready reaction premix in the snapshot
kit, 1 μl sbe 10 μm primer, and  <dig>  μl exosap-it
treated pcr product, and repeated in  <dig> thermal cycles of 95°c for
10 sec, 50°c for 5 sec, and 60°c for 30 sec. removal of
unincorporated dye-labeled ddntps was completed by addition of 5 μl
sap mix  into the sbe reaction mix, and incubation at
37°c for 60 min and 75°c for 15 min. genotyping was
performed using 8 μl mix in each well of a new plate consisting of
1 μl sap treated sbe product,  <dig>  μl genescan  <dig> liz size
standard, and  <dig>  μl hi-di formamide, which was denatured at
95°c 3 min then immediately moved on ice for at least 2 min. the
snapshot files were used to score snps by genemarker  in which a validated snp consisted of two different
nucleotides.

RESULTS
haplotype-based est-snps in citrus cultivars
haplotype-based snps were mined from ests of the  <dig> citrus cultivars and  <dig> groups
 using the qualitysnp pipeline and summarized in detail . in summary , a total of  <dig>  qsnps
 were identified from ests of the
 <dig> cultivars mined separately. these are attributed to heterozygosity within
cultivars at snp loci. there were only  <dig> snps duplicated according to
comparison of all the 25-mer oligo sequences. the percentages of the  <dig> snp types
were similar among most citrus cultivars with each type of quality snps found.
among the  <dig>  qsnps summed from the  <dig> citrus cultivars,  <dig>   were
transitions ,  <dig>   transversions , and
 <dig>   insertion/deletion events . on average, there were  <dig>  snps
per contig and one snp every  <dig>  bp in all of the snp-containing contig
sequences .
discovered from citrus ests. presented here are  <dig> selected
citrus cultivars,  <dig> groups, and  <dig> sums. so, sweet orange; cm, clementine
mandarin; pm, ponkan mandarin; sm, satsuma mandarin; ml, rangpur lime;
bo, sour orange; gf, grapefruit; nk, nagami kumquat; to, trifoliate
orange; m <dig>  snps from ests combined from  <dig> mandarins , l <dig>  snps from ests combined
from  <dig> limes / lemons ; c <dig>  snps from all ests combined ; sm <dig>  sl <dig> and sc <dig>  the
respective sum of the  <dig> mandarins,  <dig> limes/lemons, and all 27
cultivars. on the average of the  <dig> cultivars , transitions  account for  <dig> %, transversions  for  <dig> %,
and insertion/deletions  for  <dig> %.

for individual cultivars, their numbers of ests were different, so
consequentially were their quality snps and other related numbers. for example,
in so,  <dig>  ests yielded  <dig>  contigs of >= <dig> ests. of these,  <dig> 
contigs contained  <dig>  potential snps and  <dig>  contained qsnps. the total
number of qsnps was  <dig> . in other words, there was only one haplotype
detected in  <dig>  contigs  and no quality snp identified in
the additional  <dig>  contigs  with potential snps. there were
 <dig>  quality snps per contig and one quality snp per 723 bp in the contigs
on average. of these  <dig>  qsnps,  <dig>   were transitions ,  <dig>   transversions , and  <dig> 
insertion/deletion ; and  <dig>   were nssnps and  <dig>  
were ssnps. the absolute numbers of quality snps were not comparable due to
varying numbers of ests among citrus cultivars, but the number of potential and
quality snps from each cultivar were strongly correlated with its number of
ests; more ests yielded more usable contigs  available for snp
mining, as well as more quality snps . given the large differences in the numbers of ests available
among the various cultivars, it is more interesting to compare snp frequencies,
rates, and ratios among cultivars with substantial est numbers and distinct
genetic backgrounds, and differences between the mining results of the three
grouped ests  and the three sums/averages  of separately mined counterpart individuals. these comparisons will be
elaborated hereafter.

haplotypes detected in contigs with snps
one important feature of qualitysnp is to re-cluster ests in a contig to
reconstruct and determine the haplotypes in that contig, from which only single
nucleotide discrepancies between any two defined haplotypes 
are considered as potential snps for further quality and confidence
interrogation. only those potential snps passing confidence scores are
identified as quality snps. in additional file  <dig>  all
the haplotypes detected in the snp-containing contigs from all the  <dig> citrus
cultivars are included. theoretically, there should be only a maximum of 2
haplotypes detected in a diploid genome. as expected, a vast majority of
snp-containing contigs consisted of two haplotypes, but the percentages of 2
haplotypes varied in a wide range in these citrus cultivars . among the
highest were ml , sc , and gf , and among the lowest pm , kl
, and cm . the variation likely results from the genetic makeup of the
“cultivar” used to generate the ests. for example, ests for so came
from navel oranges, blood oranges, and others named c. sinensis, rather
than a single genotype. in contrast, other “cultivars” are likely
single clones. it was also evident as expected that much lower percentages of 2
haplotypes were found in three combined est datasets  due to introduction of more haplotypes from different types of citrus
cultivars, compared to their counterpart averages of each group . as a consequence, more qsnps in higher qsnps/psnps and
qsnps/ests ratios were found in the three grouped est datasets , compared to their counterparts  summed from the
individually mined cultivar est results, but the ratio of contigs with qsnps and
contigs used was the opposite . the frequency of qsnps is much higher in the
pooled data for the three groups  than in the summed data for
individual cultivars. this is because the group values include polymorphism
among homozygous accessions as well as heterozygosity within cultivars, while
the summed data include only snps due to heterozygosity. in other words, the
nucleotide at such a snp is very likely homozygous within a genotype, making it
useless in genetic linkage mapping of that genotype.
contigs  with potential snps. presented here are 9
selected citrus cultivars,  <dig> groups, and  <dig> sums. so, sweet orange; cm,
clementine mandarin; pm, ponkan mandarin; sm, satsuma mandarin; ml,
rangpur lime; bo, sour orange; gf, grapefruit; nk, nagami kumquat; to,
trifoliate orange; m <dig>  snps from ests combined from  <dig> mandarins
, l <dig>  snps from ests
combined from  <dig> limes/lemons ; c <dig>  snps from all ests combined ; sm <dig>  sl <dig> and sc <dig>  the
respective sum of the  <dig> mandarins,  <dig> limes/lemons, and all 27
cultivars.
respectively in three ratios. there are three ratios presented
as percentage, qsnps, the number of quality snps; psnps, the number of
potential snps; ests, the number of ests; contigs qsnps, the number of
contigs with qsnps; contigs used, the number of contigs with >=4
ests. m <dig>  l <dig> and c <dig> are mined from grouped ests from the corresponding
cultivars, and sm <dig>  sl <dig>  and sc <dig> summed from individually mined
cultivars used in the grouped counterparts, respectively.

alignment and distribution on the clementine reference genome
a total of  <dig>  25-mer sequences  with quality snps from all the  <dig> citrus cultivars were
used to align to the clementine reference scaffolds  using
blastn at a cut-off e-value of 6e- <dig> .
 <dig>  sequences had “no hits found” and  <dig>  one or more hits. of
the  <dig>  snps with hits,  <dig>  had only  <dig> scaffold hit with only  <dig> alignment
on the scaffold,  <dig>  had  <dig> scaffold hit but >= <dig> alignments on the
scaffold , and  <dig> had >=2
scaffold hits  with  <dig> or more alignments on each
of the scaffolds . it suggested the  <dig>  25-mer oligo sequences appear to be unique in
the genome, and the remaining  <dig>  25-mer sequences may have duplicated or
similar sequences with at least 84% identities at different locations in the
genome. there was one extreme case that one 25-mer sequence from trifoliate
orange yielded  <dig> scaffold hits and  <dig>  alignments on all the scaffolds, the
highest numbers of all.

the clementine reference genome was used as the blast database. all
the oligo sequences were listed in additional file  <dig>  aln – alignment;  <dig> hit  – hit
only  <dig> scaffold with  <dig> alignment;  <dig> hit  – hit on only
 <dig> scaffold but with  <dig> or more alignments, and 2+ hits
 – hit on  <dig> and more scaffolds with one
or more alignment to each scaffold.

taking these multiple scaffold hits and alignments into account, the total number
of scaffold hits was  <dig>  with a total of  <dig>  alignments on the scaffolds.
most had 100%  or 96%  nucleotide identities to those on the
reference genome, accounting for 93% of all the alignments. almost all the
nucleotide discrepancies in the 24/ <dig> alignments were at the snp sites, which is
an encouraging in silico validation of these snps. of the total  <dig> 
scaffold hits,  <dig>  were on main scaffolds  <dig> to  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> % of
the total. the remaining  <dig> were on  <dig> small scaffolds. figure  <dig> showed the distribution of snps with all and unique hits
from so, to, and cm on scaffold_ <dig> of the haploid clementine genome .
according to the aligned snp counts on each 500 kb, there were some
featured regions . for
example, in so many fewer unique hits were found in the middle region, compared
to those in two arm regions. relatively even distribution was observed in cm,
with exceptions at interval  <dig> with overwhelming duplicated hits of certain snps
. there were very limited unique snps aligned
at interval 20– <dig> of all the three cultivars, suggesting the region may
contain the centromere, usually characterized by fewer genes. these results,
combined with other criteria, should greatly facilitate selection of
well-distributed core sets of snps across citrus genomes for different
genotyping applications and genetic studies.
as an example. each interval of the x-axis represented
500 kb of the scaffold, and the y-axis represented the number of
snps in each 500 kb on the scaffold. so – sweet orange
; to – trifoliate orange ; cm –
clementine mandarin ; “_a” – counts of all
alignments generated by all snps; “_1” – counts of
snps of only  <dig> unique hit/alignment in the genome. differences between
the “_a” and “_1” numbers are observed in
several regions of each cultivar.

snp validation by sequencing and snapshot genotyping assay
of the  <dig> randomly selected sweet orange snps,  <dig> were validated by sequencing
and  <dig> by snapshot in sweet orange . there were  <dig> validated by both assays and the remainder validated
by only one assay. in other words,  <dig> were validated by only sequencing but
failed in snapshot, and  <dig> by only snapshot but failed in sequencing. therefore,
a total of  <dig> snps  were validated by at least one of the two assays. the
high rate  of validated snps was consistent with 93% alignments onto the
reference genome with 100%  or 96%  identities , indicating that qualitysnp, a haplotype-based snp mining
algorithm and pipeline, is a very reliable tool to identify true est snps, and
it can effectively minimize the false discovery rate even without quality
files.

discussion
estimation of heterozygosity of different citrus genomes by haplotype-based
snps
many naturally evolved genomes are heterozygous, and the heterozygosity level may
be evaluated by the rate of allelic nucleotide variations between the two
haplotypes  <cit> . snps, the most abundant polymorphisms in genomes, likely are the
most appropriate index for the heterozygosity levels of
genetically/taxonomically related genomes  <cit> . given the different numbers and rates of haplotype-based snps
discovered from these citrus individuals with substantial numbers of ests , the
ratios of qsnps/ests in most of them appeared reflective of their heterozygous
status and genetic background. these hybrid derivatives had much higher
qsnps/ests ratio, while the other believed “pure” species had lower
ratios. for example, some proven natural hybrid cultivars, such as so, cm, and
recent hybrids such as sc, were among the higher qsnps/ests ratios . other presumed true species, including pm, fell in
the lower qsnp/ests ratios . the number of needed ests to generate
the desired number of snps in given citrus genotypes, and vice versa, can be
estimated. such a tendency, along with the ratios and genome heterozygosity,
could be strengthened and would be more conclusive if the numbers of ests in all
the cultivars were close to each other, or at least in a much smaller range.

snp discovery and validation rates
snp mining is no longer a bottleneck because computational capacity and sequence
data are exponentially increasing, and more snp mining pipelines have become
available in recent years  <cit> . hundreds of thousands of snps can be easily mined out of est or
genomic sequences. inclusion of false snps in genotyping certainly is wasteful;
therefore, maximizing the true snp rate  is the most
important consideration or requirement for a snp mining algorithm because any
validation approach can only validate these true snps, but not false ones  <cit> . we found that 93% of snps identified by the qualitysnp pipeline were
aligned onto the reference genome at 25/ <dig> or 24/ <dig> identities, and 81% of
randomly selected sweet orange snps were validated by sequencing and snapshot
genotyping. it was undetermined whether the others not aligned at the two
identity rates, and not validated by sequencing and/or genotyping, were true or
false snps. for example, those failing in sequencing validation might be due to
sbe primer sequences not being found , or
sequencing failures caused by primers of low quality or in a variable region, or
no nucleotide discrepancies at the sites. it was unclear how these snps failed
in snapshot validation; it is speculated some of these sbe primers might be
incorrectly positioned, i.e., the singly extended nucleotides may not have been
exactly at the snp sites. there were a few such cases identified ; very likely due to the differences between these consensus
contigs and the original haplotype sequences. on the other hand, only 2
haplotypes may exist in a diploid genome. if snps were from the contigs with
more than  <dig> haplotypes, such cases could result from either ests mixed from
diverse genotypes in the same species or highly identical paralogs assembled
into the contigs. paralogous genes, resulting from genomic duplication and
evolving into different functions, are very common in many genomes and remain
almost identical in their conserved regions. ests from different paralogous
genes, if assembled into a same unigene, could yield false snps that are
non-allelic and useless.

criteria for selection of citrus core snp sets
in most cases the discovered snps could easily reach a number so large that only
a small portion of them, designated core snp set, are selected and used in
genotyping to meet the restraints in available budget, desired platform,
applications, and other factors  <cit> . these core sets of different numbers  are either required by certain snp genotyping platforms or optimized
for particular applications  <cit> . it may be a daunting job, but it is necessary to establish workable
criteria to select any core set of different numbers of snps. based on this
complete mining and validation process, several attributes of snps can be very
useful and distinguishing to refine these core sets of different numbers. snp
oligo alignment uniqueness, identity percentage, and distribution in the
reference genome, co-existence across different genomes, along with snp types
 and numbers per
gene, should be the main criteria for selection of citrus core snp sets. as
pointed out, some extra haplotypes might result from paralogs across different
genome regions. in that case, the resulting snps would not be allelic or useful.
whether they mostly were those snps that had multiple scaffold hits and
alignments remains unclear pending further investigation. those snps from either
circumstance should be excluded or at least deprioritized for use in genotyping.
selection of snps for genotyping could be difficult when different attributes of
snps and genotyping platforms are considered. a tool based on these attributes
is being developed to achieve the automatic selection of core snp sets for
targeted applications/platforms  <cit>  and to allow geneticists and molecular breeders to be able to select
and use certain core snps of interest from among the thousands discovered  <cit> . all the snps 
identified in this work are being added to a citrus genome database
. very recently after this study, another draft genome of
sweet orange was reported, yielding  <dig>  million genome-wide snps, about  <dig> 
snps/kb, which could be an additional valuable resource in snp applications  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
high-quality snps in public ests from different citrus genotypes were detected by the
qualitysnp pipeline and compared to estimate the heterozygosity of each genome. all
the short snp oligo sequences were also aligned with the clementine citrus genome to
determine their distribution and uniqueness in the genome and for in silico
validation. selected snps were also validated by snapshot and sequencing.
