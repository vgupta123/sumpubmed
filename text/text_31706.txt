BACKGROUND
modern plant research relies heavily on the use of transient and stable transformation with the help of agrobacterium tumefaciens <cit> . this bacterium is a natural genetic engineer and transfers a part of its large ti plasmid into host plants to induce cell division and the synthesis of opines. for use in genetic engineering, the ti plasmid has been divided into a helper plasmid which is devoid of the t-dna and remains within the agrobacteria and a binary vector carrying the t-dna which can be manipulated in e. coli. the first widely used binary vector was pbin <dig>  <cit> . many derivatives have been described and some are still in use today although other binary vectors which are smaller, have a higher copy number, and different selectable markers for use in bacteria  and in plants have been introduced . one popular series are the ppzp vectors  <cit>  which were also the basis for the pcambia vectors  <cit> . we have recently published an improved ppzp vector  which was equipped with a kanamycin resistance gene for selection in agrobacterium  <cit>  . the strong 35 s camv promoter driving the plant resistance gene for kanamycin resistance was replaced by the weaker nos promoter because it had been shown that the 35 s promoter driving the plant resistance marker in the original ppzp vectors can lead to ectopic expression of the transgene  <cit> . furthermore, ppzp <dig> contains an expression cassette which consists of an intron-containing gus gene driven by a strong constitutive promoter . this vector has successfully been used in our laboratory.

plant selectable markers for the ppzp vectors include kanamycin and gentamycin. both markers work well for a variety of plant species. kanamycin is perhaps the most widely used selectable marker for plant transformation. kanamycin and gentamycin as well as other antibiotic markers have the disadvantage that they are usually used under sterile conditions. in case of arabidopsis this means that to isolate transgenic plants the seeds have to be sterilized and grown on a sterile agar medium containing the antibiotics. recently it has been shown that the selection of transgenic plant lines containing a kanamycin marker gene can be done by culturing the seedlings on rockwool saturated with ms medium without sugar but containing the selective agent  <cit> . since the medium does not contain sugar, sterile conditions are not necessary, saving costs and labour. however, extreme care has to be taken that the seedlings do not run dry. other markers that also circumvent the need to work under sterile conditions use resistance against herbicides, especially phosphinotricin . the herbicide can be sprayed onto plants growing in soil to select for those containing the bar gene which mediates resistance against phosphinotricin  <cit> . fluorescent proteins have also been reported as markers for plant transformation including arabidopsis  <cit> . for arabidopsis transformation, dsred, gfp, and gfp variants have been used as markers driven by seed-specific promoters derived from other plant species  <cit> .

during cloning of a vector for transient expression we realized that the ppzp vectors contain  <dig> noti sites in their backbone such that this eight-cutter could not be used in the polylinker. starting with ppzp <dig>  we have therefore removed all noti sites from the vector backbone as well as other unnecessary parts to produce ppzp <dig>  by replacing the spectinomycin resistance gene with the nptii gene we also produced the vector ppzp <dig> 

the vector ppzp <dig> does not contain a plant selectable marker as this is not needed for transient expression. however, since ppzp <dig> was much smaller than the original ppzp vectors, it could be the basis of a new binary vector  for stable transformation of arabidopsis. for that we included a dsred gene driven by the pdf <dig>  promoter and the gus cassette from ppzp <dig>  the pdf <dig>  promoter was chosen because it is strongly expressed in seeds and in syncytia, feeding sites induced by the beet cyst nematode h. schachtii in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . in addition, we replaced the spectinomycin resistance gene used for selection in agrobacteria by a kanamycin resistance gene.

RESULTS
construction of ppzp <dig> and ppzp600
the binary vector ppzp <dig> is a high copy number, stable, and fully sequenced plasmid vector harbouring the pvsi derived backbone  <cit> . however, presence of three noti sites in ppzp <dig> precluded the use of noti for cloning. therefore, these noti sites have been eliminated by a series of pcr amplifications  to produce ppzp <dig>  as described in the methods section. we confirmed that the vector was still fully functional by introduction of the gus cassette from ppzp <dig>  <cit>  and transient expression of the resulted plasmid ppzp <dig> in nicotiana benthamiana . 

vector ppzp <dig> contains the streptomycin/spectinomycin resistance gene  which can be used in e. coli and in agrobacteria. however, in our hands spectinomycin selection was not as tight as kanamycin selection. we, therefore, replaced the spectinomycin resistance gene with the nptii gene which yielded the vector ppzp <dig>  as described in methods.

construction of pmaa-red
vectors containing a fluorescent protein coupled to a seed-specific promoter have been described before. here, we have used the fluorescent marker dsred  <cit>  and the promoter of the pdf <dig>  gene  <cit>  from arabidopsis because we were especially interested in overexpressing genes that are downregulated in syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode h. schachtii in arabidopsis roots  <cit> . the reason to use this promoter was that it is not only expressed in seeds but also in syncytia  <cit> . the pdf <dig>  promoter  and dsred region were amplified from the vector ppzp3425-ppdf <dig> :: dsred  which contained a pdf <dig>  promoter fused to dsred. the pdf <dig>  promoter was amplified using the ppdf <dig> ecofor primer containing an ecori site and the ppdf <dig> ncorev primer with ncoi site . for amplification of the dsred + 35 s terminator fragment, redfor with bsphi and redrev with bamhi sites were used. the pdf <dig>  promoter pcr product was digested with ecori and ncoi and that of dsred with bsphi and bamhi. the vector ppzp <dig> was digested with ecori and bamhi. these three fragments were mixed and ligated together to yield ppzp <dig> . the ecori and bamhi sites were eliminated sequentially by digestion, filling in the ends using klenow enzyme, and religation which resulted in the intermediate vector ppzp <dig>  . this intermediate vector was digested with hindiii and a polylinker  was inserted. the orientation of the polylinker was determined by digestion with ecori and xbai . this vector was named ppzp <dig> . we then introduced the gus cassette from pzp <dig> by digesting ppzp <dig> with hindiii and ligating the vector with the gus cassette derived also by digestion with hindiii to make ppzp <dig> . orientation of the cassette was tested by pcr using dsredfor <dig> and gusrev primers . since this vector contained two 35 s terminators we could not use terminator reverse primers for sequencing of our gene of interest delivered by the camv promoter. we therefore, replaced the 35 s terminator in the dsred cassette with a nos terminator by a series of polymerase chain reactions. in a first step, the last part of dsred  from vector ppzp <dig> was amplified by using primers dsredmfor and dsrednosterrev. in the second step, we amplified the nos terminator by using primers dsrednosterfor primer and nosterreveco . then overlapping pcr was done using dsredmfor and nosterreveco primers. both, the amplified pcr product and ppzp <dig> were digested with stui and ecori and large vector fragment and insert were ligated to produce the final binary vector pmaa-red  . 

production of transgenic arabidopsis lines using pmaa-red
the vector pmaa-red was transformed into agrobacteria and then into arabidopsis using the floral dip method. seeds were harvested and red fluorescent seeds were selected using an inverted fluorescence microscope . these t <dig> seeds were grown on soil and siliques that showed a 3: <dig> ratio of fluorescent and non-fluorescent seeds  were used to produce homozygous lines  which did not show any phenotypic difference. we confirmed the expression of the dsred cassette in syncytia by growing seedlings from homozygous lines on agar and infection with h. schachtii larvae. as expected, in these lines, the pdf <dig>  promoter directed dsred expression not only in seeds but also in syncytia .

it could be argued that the dsred expression in syncytia might influence the development of syncytia and lead to higher susceptibility or resistance. to test this possibility, we compared the resistance of an arabidopsis line transformed with the vector pmaa-red with wild-type plants at  <dig> dpi. we could not detect significant differences between wild-type plants and the transgenic line as numbers of males and females as well as sizes of syncytia and female nematodes are concerned .

overexpression lines are often produced to achieve a strong expression of the gene of interest. for that reason strong promoters are used, such as the camv 35 s promoter  <cit> . however, mainly due to the insertion of the transgene in different parts of the genome, the transgenic lines that are produced vary widely in expression level  <cit> . it is therefore necessary to screen a number of lines at the transcript level or the protein level. we reasoned that this lengthy procedure could be shortened if selecting those lines with a strong fluorescence in seeds. to test this hypothesis, we selected  <dig> transgenic lines transformed with the vector pmaa-red. we arranged these lines by eye according to the strength of fluorescence in the seeds . we grew seedlings of these lines and stained the leaves for gus expression  which showed a correlation with dsred expression in seeds. we confirmed this result by measuring the gus expression level in seedlings . thus, to select transgenic lines with a strong expression level, one simply has to select several transgenic seeds with a strong dsred fluorescence. 

discussion
a large variety of binary vectors for plant transformation have been described. among them the ppzp series of vectors  <cit>  and the derived pcambia vectors  <cit>  are especially popular. a prominent feature of these vectors is their stability in bacteria, the high copy number, and the relatively small size. one disadvantage was the use of the camv promoter for the plant selectable marker and the use of spectinomycin and chloramphenicol as selectable markers for bacteria which led us to construct the vector ppzp <dig>  <cit> . in this vector the camv35s promoter for the plant selectable marker  was replaced by the weaker nos promoter and a kanamycin resistance gene for selection in bacteria was included in the vector backbone.

although ppzp <dig> proved useful for our purposes in producing promoter:: gus lines  or overexpression lines   <cit> , selection of homozygous transgenic lines with a strong expression of the gene of interest was still a lengthy procedure. since we were interested to produce a large number of transgenic arabidopsis overexpression lines with a strong expression level for putative antimicrobial peptides we set out to construct a ppzp vector that would have three important features: first, it should allow us to use selection or screening on soil to avoid growing arabidopsis under sterile conditions. second, we wanted to easily select lines with a strong expression level. third, the vector should be used for the expression in syncytia using specific promoters that would not be active in seedlings or leaves.

the first precondition excluded the use of antibiotic resistance such as kanamycin or hygromycin or the use of metabolite resistance genes such as the e. coli-derived phosphomannose isomerase which allows growth on mannose  <cit>  or the streptomyces rubiginosus xylose isomerase  gene which allows growth on xylose  <cit>  as a plant selectable marker for which sterile conditions would have to be used. herbicide resistance would avoid the need for sterile growth but all t <dig> seedlings have to be grown for selection. in contrast, if using a fluorescent marker that is expressed in seeds, only the transgenic seeds obtained after transformation would have to be grown further and no additional treatment would be needed. such an approach is especially important if a large number of transgenic lines have to be produced. an example is the work of  <cit>  who conducted a high-throughput screen in arabidopsis for castor genes that would lead to changes in hydroxy fatty acid composition in seeds. we decided to try the dsred gene as a screenable marker  <cit> . this leaves the possibility to use in addition gfp or other most frequently used fluorescent markers as reporter genes. furthermore, dsred has a rather weak fluorescence which might seem to be a disadvantage. however, this weak fluorescence makes it easier to identify seeds with a different level of fluorescence.

expression of the gene of interest varies largely in independent transgenic lines  <cit>  due mainly to position effects. one way of reducing this variation is the inclusion of matrix attachment regions in the t-dna. however, this only worked with gene silencing mutants, which limits the use of these vectors  <cit> . we have demonstrated here that the use of the vector pmaa-red allows an easy and efficient selection of transgenic lines with a strong expression of the gene of interest in wild-type arabidopsis plants. of course, mutants could also be used, if needed. pre-selection of lines with a strong dsred expression in seeds according to their fluorescence reduces the number of lines that have to be tested at the transcript or protein level.

our third precondition was that the vector should allow the use of syncytium-specific promoters instead of the camv promoter which is active in most tissues of arabidopsis plants. we have recently shown that several genes are expressed in syncytia which are normally expressed in pollen  <cit> , such as miox <dig> and miox <dig>  or in seeds, such as pdf <dig>  whose promoter is used here to drive the expression of dsred in seeds. using the miox <dig> or miox <dig> promoter would allow a specific expression in syncytia which could be useful for genes with a negative effect on plant growth. however, screening such transgenic lines would require the analysis of expression of the gene of interest in syncytia. such a screening is very time consuming because syncytia have to be cut out from infected roots. in this case a pre-screening that would reduce the number of lines would lead to a significant reduction of time and effort. thus, the pmaa-red vector that we have constructed is especially useful for the syncytium-specific expression of transgenes or for similar cases where the expression of the transgene would be restricted to tissues that could not be easily screened. promoter::reporter constructs and overexpression lines can be produced from this vector as from ppzp <dig>  <cit> . the camv promoter can be replaced by a promoter of interest using ncoi and one of the unique sites in the polylinker. the gus sequence can be replaced with a sequence for overexpression of a gene of interest by using ncoi and bamhi. if the sequence to be cloned contains ncoi or bamhi site, it is usually possible to use a restriction enzyme that produces compatible cohesive ends with ncoi and bamhi. for instance, bsphi, pcii, and fati produce cohesive ends that are compatible with ncoi.

after transformation of arabidopsis plants it takes about 3–4 weeks until t <dig> seeds can be harvested and inspected for fluorescent seeds. a big advantage of transformation with the vector pmaa-red is that only these selected seeds have to be grown on soil to produce the t <dig> generation. after another 4 weeks, the first siliques of these plants can be screened for a 3: <dig> segregation of fluorescent seeds which can then be used to produce homozygous t <dig> seeds for further analysis. again, the first siliques of these plants can be used to select homozygous lines and only those will be grown for maturity, which will take a total of  <dig> to 8 weeks. depending on the growth conditions, the whole procedure from transformation to harvesting homozygous seeds could be completed within four month.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed compact ppzp vectors without noti sites having either bacterial spectinomycin or kanamycin resistance  and a vector  which allows an easy production of transgenic arabidopsis overexpression lines with strong expression levels of the gene of interest.
