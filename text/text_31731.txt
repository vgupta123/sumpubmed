BACKGROUND
patients with cystic fibrosis , an autosomal recessively inherited disease caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  gene, are particularly susceptible to pulmonary infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . colonization of the airways of cf patients with p. aeruginosa results in higher morbidity and mortality because of the faster decline of the lung function, especially from the chronic infection phase onwards  <cit> . detection of colonization and infection by this pathogen as early as possible enables to postpone the chronic infective stage and eventually to achieve the eradication of p. aeruginosa through early treatment. indeed, early aggressive antibiotic therapy is now generally accepted as an efficient means to postpone chronic colonization  <cit> .

in most routine laboratories detection of bacterial species in respiratory samples is achieved by culture. however, it has been shown that routine culture of sputa from cf patients yields limited microbiological information since it frequently fails to identify the pathogens, which were shown to be present by means of pcr  <cit> . furthermore, the correct detection and identification of p. aeruginosa, although in general not a fastidious organism, is not as straightforward as frequently assumed  <cit> . to circumvent culture associated limitations, several molecular assays for the detection of pseudomonas species have been described  <cit> , döring and colleagues  <cit>  correctly remarked that, because of the influence of sample pretreatment, dna-extraction protocol and the pcr format, there is a need for validation of the pcr techniques before these can be used in a routine laboratory. however, to our knowledge, no study systematically compared the sensitivity of different culture, dna-extraction, pcr and real-time pcr methods for the detection of p. aeruginosa from cf sputum, by using a cf patient sputum based dilution series of p. aeruginosa.

here, we compared the sensitivity of three culture media, five dna-extraction protocols, two conventional pcr formats and four real-time pcr formats for the detection of p. aeruginosa, using a dilution series of p. aeruginosa positive sputa in a pool of p. aeruginosa negative sputa.

RESULTS
in this study, we compared the sensitivity of different culture and pcr methods. to that purpose, we prepared a p. aeruginosa dilution series in cf sputum by diluting p. aeruginosa positive cf patient sputa in a pool of p. aeruginosa negative cf patient sputa. this was done instead of diluting cultured p. aeruginosa cells in saline or diluting p. aeruginosa positive sputum in saline or spiking sputa with p. aeruginosa cells, to mimick as closely as possible the sputum samples sent to routine laboratories.

comparison of culture methods
no differences in detection limit could be observed between mcconjey agar  and cetrimide agar , i.e. respectively an average of  <dig> and  <dig> colonies were counted at dilution eight. for cetrimide broth  the detection range was also comparable with that of mca and ca, i.e. p. aeruginosa could be detected up to dilution eight, but the number of colonies was too high to be countable .

c the initial inoculum was calculated by averaging the number of cfu at dilution  <dig> on mc and ca, i.e.  <dig>  cfu/ <dig> μl, multiplying with  <dig> to obtain the cfu/ml, i.e.  <dig> cfu/ml, multiplying with the dilution factor 1/ <dig> to obtain the initial inoculum after dilution with sputasol, i.e.  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> cfu/ml, and finally multiplying with factor  <dig> to obtain the original number of cfu/ml of sputum, i.e.  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> cfu/ml, or approx.  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml.

based on these results, the number of culturable cells in the original sputum preparation was calculated to be  <dig>  log <dig> cfu/ml.

comparison of dna-extraction protocols
for each sputum dilution, dna was extracted by four protocols using the biomérieux easymag nuclisens semi-automated dna-extractor and by the protocol for the manual high pure pcr template preparation kit . results are listed in table  <dig>  in our hands, the biomérieux easymag nuclisens protocol generic  <dig> . <dig>  combined with proteinase k pretreatment, was the dna-extraction protocol that enabled the most sensitive detection of p. aeruginosa from sputum of cf patients, both with conventional and with qualitative pcr, giving amplification of the p. aeruginosa oprl target gene up to dilutions  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. this dna-extraction protocol was used further to compare a total of two different conventional pcr and four different  real-time pcr formats.

comparison of different pcr and real-time pcr formats
conventional pcr, using the veriti 96-well thermal cycler , combined with visualisation of the pcr products by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining respectively by capillary electrophoresis and fluorescence measurement, was compared with three different real-time pcr formats using the lightcycler  <dig>   and with a commercially available p. aeruginosa specific real-time pcr  using the abi <dig> . one real-time pcr format used sybrgreen fluorescence as the detection method, whereas the other three real-time pcr formats relied on the fluorescence generated by probes for detection.

results are listed in table  <dig>  for the conventional pcr, combined with agarose gel electrophoresis, p. aeruginosa dna could be detected up to dilution  <dig>  while with capillary electrophoresis amplified p. aeruginosa dna could be detected up to dilution  <dig>  p. aeruginosa dna could be detected up to dilution  <dig> with real-time pcr using sybrgreen, and up to dilution  <dig> with real-time pcr with the hybprobes, with the taqman probe and with the commercial pseudomonas aeruginosa taqman probe detection kit on the abi <dig>  in conclusion, the three probe based real-time pcr formats were the most sensitive molecular assays.

discussion
pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major pathogen in cystic fibrosis  patients and is an indicator of poor prognosis in cf patients, especially from the onset of the chronic stage when colonies become mucoid and variant phenotypes emerge. early detection is essential given the success of early aggressive eradication therapy  <cit> . therefore, the most prevalent detection and identification methods, i.e. culture and  pcr, should be optimized to achieve the highest sensitivity.

west et al.  <cit>  reported that specific p. aeruginosa antibodies were detectable between  <dig> and  <dig> months prior to the first positive culture for p. aeruginosa from respiratory samples. these findings suggest that culture may miss p. aeruginosa in the early stages of colonization. also at later stages, culture can miss the emerging p. aeruginosa phenotypic variants such as the pyoverdine negative mutants, the slowly growing variants, the small colony variants and the auxotrophs, which do not grow on standard media  <cit> . therefore, the development of improved culture methods and/or of molecular methods is warranted, not only for early detection but also for follow up of colonized patients. however, although several molecular assays for the detection of pseudomonas species have been described , surprisingly few studies have compared selective and nonselective culture methods with the different molecular methods that have been described for the detection of p. aeruginosa directly from clinical samples.

the studies comparing sensitivity of culture and species-specific pcr for the detection of p. aeruginosa from sputa of cf patients indicate comparable efficiency of both methods  <cit> , with slightly higher sensitivity for pcr in some studies  <cit>  or clearly higher sensitivity for pcr  <cit> . we used the pcr format published by de vos et al.  <cit>  in combination with optimized dna-extraction methods and used in addition real-time pcr to increase pcr sensitivity further. however, using a sputum dilution series of p. aeruginosa, and in accordance to most studies, we found no difference in sensitivity between any of the three culture methods and the most sensitive molecular method, i.e. dna-extraction with easymag protocol generic  <dig> . <dig> and proteinase k pretreatment combined with any of the three probe-based real-time pcrs. in our hands, culture was more sensitive than pcr and sybrgreen based real-time pcr and the difference was even more pronounced when not optimal dna-extraction methods were used. it should be noticed that we found no difference between selective and nonselective culture methods, but this may be due to the fact that no bacteria, other than p. aeruginosa in the two p. aeruginosa positive patients, could be cultured from the sputa of the  <dig> cf patients. as shown in other studies and confirmed here, the pretreatment of the sample and the dna-extraction protocol strongly influence the sensitivity of the pcr  <cit> . the most sensitive molecular detection method was obtained using the easymag generic  <dig> . <dig> protocol with proteinase k pretreatment in combination with real-time pcr with the taqman probe or the hybprobes. previous studies showed already that the easymag extractor is one of the most sensitive and reliable methods for dna-extraction  <cit> . an additional advantage of automated dna-extraction like easymag might be the lower sample processing variability  <cit> .

because both approaches, i.e. culture and  pcr, have important advantages as well as drawbacks  <cit> , in our opinion, both should be or can be combined. pcr technology has the potential to detect the fastidious p.aeruginosa variants, which are not detected by the routinely used classical culture procedures  <cit> , whereas culture yields a complete genome that can be used for e.g. phenotypic susceptibility testing and whole genome based genotyping techniques like rapd, pfge and aflp  <cit> . indeed, several of the published studies indicate that there are instances of culture positive pcr negative samples  <cit>  as well as culture negative pcr positive samples  <cit> , whereby p. aeruginosa infection can only be reliably demonstrated when both approaches are combined.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we showed, by testing p. aeruginosa positive sputum dilution series, that there is no difference in sensitivity for the detection of p. aeruginosa in sputum by selective and non-selective culture and by the most efficient dna-extraction method combined with the most efficient real-time pcr formats, i.e. the probe-based ones. a prospective study, whereby culture is compared with the dna-extraction/real-time pcr combination that was established in this study as being the most sensitive, has been started and should learn whether both approaches also yield comparable results when used to detect low inocula of p. aeruginosa as can be found after recent infection, in the sputum or nasopharyngeal samples of cf patients not yet colonized by p. aeruginosa.
