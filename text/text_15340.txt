BACKGROUND
ramie , usually called “china grass”, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the nettle family, urticaceae. ramie fiber, generated from the stem bast, is an important natural fiber in the textile industry because of the ability to retain shape, reduce wrinkling and introduce a silky luster to the appearance of a fabric  <cit> . nevertheless, the flaws, such as resistance to dyeing, confined elasticity and elongation potential and the stiff and brittle nature of the cloth, have encouraged breeding of ramie with better fiber quality. thus, focusing on the developmental process will benefit in improving ramie fiber yield and quality. to increase our understanding of ramie fiber development and related molecular mechanism, researchers have cloned genes that may related, including galat <cit> , actin <cit> , cesa <cit> , comt <cit>  and udpgdh <cit> . however, the restricted single-gene cloning strategy has limited benefits. one way to improve the process is the application of the next-generation sequencing platform, including the  <dig> flx instrument, the abi solid system and the illumina genome analyzer, which have been applied very successfully in previous studies . for example, the ramie universal transcriptome has been determined, with a preliminary quantification of  <dig> cesa  genes  <cit> . however, there has been no further research related to ramie fiber development, especially at different growth stages.

a previous study on ramie was carried out using the cultivar, “zhongzhu 1”  <cit> , which is an elite variety with good fiber quality . however, we chose “1504”  as the best qualified material to study ramie fiber development. in field production, the growth period of ramie fiber could be roughly divided into initiation, fast growth and maturation stages. however, these descriptions did not meet the need for exact experimental conditions, and the timings of their boundaries are vague, which vary in the different growth seasons of ramie. previous studies on ramie used a fixed timeline  <cit> , which may be appropriate for other experiments , but was not suitable for studies of ramie fiber development. fortunately, previous studies had extracted the fiber of flax from stem bark  <cit> , which we then followed as the sampling method.

plant cell walls are complex structures composed of polysaccharides, proteins, and lignins. among the cell wall polysaccharides, cellulose is the main load-bearing wall component  <cit> . it is the first and most important family in the cell wall, especially with regards to fiber growth and development. genes in the cellulose synthase superfamily have been studied in model plants, such as rice  <cit>  and arabidopsis <cit> . expansin, known to have cell wall loosening activity and is involved in cell expansion and other developmental events during which cell wall modification occurs  <cit> , plays important roles during cell elongation  <cit>  and expansion  <cit> , and specifically regulates fiber elongation  <cit>  and fruit ripening  <cit> . other studies have highlighted the potential relationship between expansin genes and fiber growth in cotton  <cit> . moreover, the polysaccharide, xyloglucan, is thought to play an important structural role in the primary cell wall of dicotyledons  <cit> . consequently, the xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase  family that was shown to be involved in the formation of the secondary cell walls of vascular tissue  <cit>   indicating the importance of this gene family in studying ramie fiber development. in this study, the ramie transcriptome was constructed from mixed samples, and the differentially expressed genes among these samples were used to verify potential genes that may be related to ramie fiber development. we inferred that the early developmental stage  of ramie fiber growth may play a more important role in the whole developmental period, and the  <dig> genes that all-up-regulated  in sample t , especially the four from the expansin  and xth  gene families, should be subjected to further in-depth characterization.

RESULTS
de novoassembly of the transcriptome library
the read lengths of four separately pooled samples, which were evenly distributed throughout the ramie stem , as well as the overall assembled sequences, are shown in table  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  the average read lengths were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 460 bp for the four samples, respectively. the whole run generated  <dig> , <dig> reads with an average length of 457 bp. after removing the low-quality reads , the clean reads were assembled de novo by the newbler software, which is frequently used in de novo pyrosequencing projects  <cit> , using default settings. as a result,  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  isotigs were generated. after elimination of redundancy,  <dig>  unigenes  were generated; the contigs had an average length of  <dig>  bp . among the unigenes,  <dig>   and  <dig>   sequences were longer than 200 bp and 1000 bp, respectively. the lengths of the assembled unigenes ranged from  <dig> to 7641 bp .table  <dig>

gene annotation and functional pathway construction
the getorf tool from emboss  <cit>  was used for gene prediction, which identified all of the assembled contigs and isotigs to encode protein sequences and were qualified for further annotation. the predicted protein sequences were then annotated to the non-redundant protein databases in genbank and swiss-prot using blastp under the threshold of 1e- <dig>  the first entry was regarded as the annotation information for the corresponding unigenes. however, there might be a situation where the “true” blast result was concealed by the first non-informative entry  when choosing the first entry as the annotation information. to overcome this obstacle, we repeated the blast of the unigenes that had been annotated to meaningless results, and the output results were expanded to  <dig> entries  for manual selection. as a result,  <dig>  entries from  <dig>  unigenes  were obtained  for further selection. finally, we altered the annotation information of  <dig> unigenes , which resulted in the annotation of  <dig> from  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  from  <dig>  isotigs . meanwhile, the predicted protein sequences were compared with the swiss-prot and trembl databases using blastp . the  <dig>   retrieved protein sequences were then matched to  <dig> gene ontology  terms  using the gopipe software  <cit> . in addition, the predicted protein sequences were compared to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit>  using a bidirectional blast under the threshold of 1e- <dig>  which resulted in a total of  <dig> ko  numbers that corresponded to particular sequences. the pathway distribution is shown in additional file  <dig> and detailed in additional file  <dig> 

differential expression redundancy and enrichment analyses
as indicated in table  <dig>  hundreds of unigenes had differential expression levels between each combination of two samples, except for the comparison of samples m and b . the numbers of differentially expressed unigenes in each sample are displayed in figure  <dig>  which shows that there were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes up-regulated in samples l, t, m and b, respectively; while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were down-regulated, respectively. altogether  <dig> unigenes were differentially expressed . notably, the numbers of up- and down-regulated unigenes in the sample combination m and b  were greater than in the other two-sample combinations , which coincided with the lowest numbers of differentially expressed unigenes between m and b . this suggested that either the degree of fiber development was similar between samples m and b or gene regulation only has a minor influence on fiber growth during the later developmental stages.table  <dig> 
numbers of unigenes that had differential expression patterns between each two-sample combination


numbers were calculated by comparing the earlier samples to the latter ones. for instance, numbers in the last row represented  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes were up- and down-regulated in sample m compared to sample b. unigenes were up-regulated when the q-value <  <dig>  and log <dig> normalized > <dig>  or down-regulated when the q-value <  <dig>  and log <dig> normalized < - <dig> .
numbers of unigenes that were differentially expressed in the four samples. numbers displayed were either up-regulated  or down-regulated  in the four samples, which were stem shoot with leaves , top part of stem bark , middle part of stem bark  and bottom part of stem bark . numbers of unigenes that shared simultaneously differentially expressed patterns in more than one sample displayed at the intersections of the correspondent samples.



among the differentially expressed unigenes, the enrichment of go terms  and kegg pathways  was dependent on the ratio of divergence to all unigenes  < <dig> ). as indicated in table  <dig>  the two conjunct go terms enriched in sample t  were the external encapsulating structure  and the extracellular region . thus, the enrichment of conjunct go terms in one of the four samples compared with the other three happened only in sample t, which implied that the early stage of ramie fiber development  may be more sensitive to molecular regulation. meanwhile, the numbers of unigenes that made up these two go terms were fairly small . additionally, four kegg pathways: pathogenic escherichia coli infection; the gap junction; the photosynthesis-antenna proteins and the cutin and the suberine and the wax biosynthesis pathways  were simultaneously enriched in sample l compared with the other three samples.table  <dig> 
go terms that were enriched in each sample combination






unigenes up-regulated in the top part of the bast 
among all the unigenes that had differential expression patterns, most of the unigenes that belong to the cellulose synthase , expansin , and the xth  gene families were included in the all-up pattern from sample t. specifically, isotig01514_ <dig>  isotig06919_ <dig>  isotig06943_ <dig> and isotig07154_ <dig>  from the cellulose synthase superfamily; isotig10345_ <dig>  isotig02054_ <dig> and isotig01251_ <dig>  from the expansin family; and hrx1mbh01blwdw_ <dig>  isotig00610_ <dig>  isotig01663_ <dig>  isotig04660_ <dig>  isotig09773_ <dig> and contig04902_ <dig>  from the xth family were highlighted for their coincident all-up expression patterns in sample t .figure  <dig> 
relative expression quantities of the  <dig> unigenes. the relative expression levels within the four parts  among the  <dig> unigenes  from the cellulose synthase superfamily, three unigenes  from the expansin gene family and six unigenes  from the xth gene family, respectively) at three seasons  are shown by line charts . each line chart  was formed as the order of samples l, t, m and b  for their quantitative results . quantitative qrt-pcr was carried out  on the four sample parts  in the first , second  and third  seasons with three biological replicates. the expression levels  were transformed  into colors  in order to assess their overall expression levels. meanwhile, the significance analyses were performed within each unigene among four samples, using the holm-sidak method of sigmaplot software, under the p-value of  <dig> . the rpkm values that were obtained from the transcriptome sequencing results are also shown .



therefore, we hypothesized that the early fiber developmental stage, represented by sample t , has a more important role in ramie fiber growth than the other stages. subsequently, these  <dig> unigenes were picked out for quantitative real-time reverse transcription pcr  quantification using similarly pooled samples from the first season , the second season  and the third season . the overall expression quantities are shown by their colors  that were translated from the quantification results . generally speaking, the expression pattern trends for firs  were similar to the reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads  values , whereas there were differences between every unigene in terms of timing, which coincided with the phenomenon that ramie fiber has differing qualities during each harvest period  <cit> . specifically, although the  <dig> unigenes were chosen because of their significant differences of expression in sample t compared with the other samples, the expression trends in secs and this were not as regular as those reflected by the rpkm values. only isotig01514_ <dig> and isotig06919_ <dig> in secs  shared similar trends with the original , while they showed dissimilar results in this . meanwhile, three unigenes  showed opposite expression patterns and two  had similar patterns in secs and this . the unigenes hrx1mbh01blwdw_ <dig> and isotig04660_ <dig>  isotig00610_ <dig> and isotig09773_ <dig> appeared to have opposite trends to the original  in secs  or in this , respectively.figure  <dig>

when we compared the  <dig> unigenes to investigate whether they were included in the two go terms that were enriched in sample t , six  were assigned to both go terms, while two  were only included in the former go term  and one  was only assigned to the latter one . none of the specifically expressed cellulose synthase genes  were assigned to either of the two go terms .

additional features included in the transcriptome data
after annotation, the statistical numbers of sequences from different species that matched ramie unigenes were calculated from the annotation features. as displayed in figure  <dig>  the five most abundant species were vitis vinifera , ricinus communis , glycine max , medicago truncatula  and arabidopsis thaliana , representing around 80% of all the species that were annotated. this was very similar to previous results for ramie transcriptome sequencing  <cit> . any dissimilarity may be attributed to the differences in the parts sampled in this study. in addition, the codon usage frequency was calculated  for homologous sequence cloning using the consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer  method  <cit> .figure  <dig>

discussion
sample preparation and pyrosequencing
ramie is a non-model highly heterozygosis perennial crop, known as “china grass”. little previous genetic research has been conducted on this crop, especially on fiber development. to standardize experimental conditions, a fixed timeline was set in previous studies  <cit> . however, the growth periods vary between ramie plants in different seasons; therefore, it is difficult for researchers to ascertain the exact standard  for sampling that represents the different fiber growth stages. in this study, we used the sampling method that has been successfully applied to flax  <cit> . accordingly, samples that represented no bast fiber cell formation , initial thickening , obvious thickening  and end of thickening  were generated  from different parts of ramie from the start of fiber ripening . correspondingly, the pyrosequencing output presented obvious and interesting dissimilarities among the four samples, represented as differentially expressed genes , and differentially enriched go terms  and kegg pathways . the  <dig> flx + platform produced average read lengths in our library of 457 bp, which improved the subsequent de novo assembly results. however, the vague boundary of our sampling standard  resulted in the quantitative results in firs  being dissimilar to the rpkm values , which suggested that our sampling method could be further standardized for future studies of ramie fiber development.

the three gene families participating in ramie fiber development
cellulose is the main component in plant cell walls  <cit> . therefore, genes in the cellulose synthase superfamily, which have been shown to be associated with primary  or secondary  cell wall formation in arabidopsis, were the first genes we investigated. a previous study identified  <dig> expressed sequence tags that belong to the cellulose synthase family  <cit>  in ramie. along with cellulose, polysaccharide xyloglucan is thought to play an important structural role in the primary cell walls of dicotyledons  <cit> , which means that the xth family, proven to have a function during the formation of secondary cell walls in vascular tissue  <cit>  , would be important in ramie fiber development. finally, expansin, which has important roles in cell elongation  <cit>  and expansion  <cit> , is also associated with cotton fiber development  <cit> . thus, we concentrated on the above three gene families in this study. as a result, most of the differentially expressed unigenes from these three gene families shared the all-up expression pattern in sample t , which showed that the early stage of ramie fiber growth  is the most important for molecular regulation  and for fiber development. in total,  <dig> unigenes showed the all-up expression pattern in sample t , which should be subjected to further studies as a priority.

expression quantities of the unigenes that shared the all-up pattern in sample t
the variant numbers of all-up expressed unigenes  in samples l  and t  compared with samples m  and b  were interesting. this result suggested that ramie grows more vigorously at the start of stem fiber growth. furthermore, the results that:  two go terms  were concurrently enriched in sample t compared with the other three samples ; and  most unigenes belonging to the three gene families  were all-up-regulated in sample t also suggested that the top part of the stem bark  was the most important part for fiber growth.

the results of qrt-pcr analysis of these  <dig> unigenes from similarly assayed samples across the whole growing season  were interesting. first, similar trends between the firs and rpkm results  could indicate the effectiveness for the whole transcriptome data. nevertheless, the quantitative result for isotig09773_ <dig> was very different  to rpkm result , and we could not determine the precise cause of this difference.

second, despite the similar trends  for each unigene between firs  and the rpkm results , the relative expression quantities of each unigene in sample l were universally higher from reflected data  than that from the predicted data . the sampling method was implicated as the origin of this discrepancy. as we previously mentioned, the stem shoot apex, including the top three  young leaves, comprised sample l and contained no bast fiber . yet the upper part of the ramie stem  grows more vigorously , which made it more sensitive to environmental elements, such as temperature and sampling time. additionally, despite the uniform sampling lengths and the validation of the slicing results , samples that were generated at different times  were still different.

finally, despite the similarity in trends between the data from firs  and rpkm , which assured the reliability of the transcriptome results, discrepancies rose between the growth stages . to determine their possible relationship with ramie fiber quality, further analysis was conducted. among the  <dig> unigenes that were chosen for further quantitative experiments, six of them  were assigned to both go terms  that were enriched in sample t compared with the other three samples . furthermore, four of the six  unigenes shared congruent expression patterns in secs and this . if this phenomenon was relevant to the differences in ramie fiber quality during the three seasons, the slightly higher relevant expression quantities of sample t  in secs compared with this  could further confirm this hypothesis. in support, ghexp <dig>  which shared a high similarity with isotig02054_ <dig> , is expressed specifically in developing cotton fiber  <cit> , while the sequence similarity was high between contig040902_ <dig> and atxth31/ atxth <dig>  which are highly expressed in tissues undergoing elongation/stem and shoot apical system  <cit> . furthermore, considering the importance of xyloglucan-cellulose cross links in modulating the strength and extensibility of the primary plant cell wall, which is a key feature of classical models of this composite structure  <cit>  and that xyloglucan endo-transglycosylase activity, along with expansins, are the primary catalyst in cell wall loosening  <cit> , we suggest that the early ramie fiber developmental stages were more sensitive to molecular regulation, which was reflected by the up-regulations of expansin and xth genes . however, we could not draw any conclusions on whether these four unigenes were specifically relevant to ramie fiber fineness or crystallinity based on our limited results. further studies should focus on the functional analysis or diversity among different cultivars during different seasons to improve our understanding of ramie fiber development. finally, future studies should focus on identifying simple sequence repeats in unigenes of interesting sites and designing primers from them, to further our understanding of the underlying molecular systems.

additional features included in the transcriptome data
although lacking of duplication in transcriptome data construction, the effectiveness of our transcriptome sequencing result was assured by a comparison of the quantitative output for firs in  <dig>  to rpkm values  conducted in  <dig>  meanwhile, manual selection significantly improved the annotation information . in addition, the four most abundant species that were annotated to vitis vinifera, ricinus communis, glycine max and medicago truncatula  were similar to previous results   <cit> , in which the authors declared that the malpighiales , fabales  and rosales  are commonly placed in the superorder of rosids, while the relationship between vitales  and rosales  is probably closer than that between rosales, malpighiales and fabales  <cit> . in this study, our results further supported the relationship between vitales , rosales , malpighiales  and fabales . however, populus trichocarpa did not appear in the most abundant annotated species list, which may indicate a dissimilarity of stem growth between ramie and populus trichocarpa, especially in bast fiber development or cell wall thickening.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, transcriptome sequencing of samples from different ramie fiber developmental stages was carried out via pyrosequencing. the  <dig>  unigenes  that were generated by de novo assembly had a high correlation with ramie fiber development, which increased our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying bast fiber development in ramie. most of the differentially expressed genes from the three targeted gene families  shared an all-up expression pattern in sample t, which suggested that the early fiber developmental stage may play a crucial role in molecular regulation throughout the entire fiber growth period. these  <dig> unigenes, especially the four of them that from the expansin  and the xth  families, could be applied in further in-depth expression and functional analyses. in addition, the sampling method used in this study could be applied and further standardized in other ramie fiber development studies.
