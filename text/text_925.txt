BACKGROUND
the adult mouse brain consists of various kinds of cells that sequentially appear as neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes from late gestation through the neonatal period. distinctive neural progenitor cells  that exhibit different differentiation potentials to neurons and glial cells are generated during mid-to-late gestation
 <cit> . this process is controlled by signaling pathways composed of transcription factors; dysfunction in genes encoding these factors is known to result in brain malformation
 <cit> .

epigenetic systems underlie the network of tissue- and developmental stage-specific transcription factors and their targets
 <cit> . major players in epigenetic systems are dna methylation and histone modifications, which occur on nucleosomes and affect chromosomal activity by changing nucleosome architecture. tissue-dependent and differentially methylated regions  are found throughout the genome and influence tissue-specific gene expression. t-dmrs have been found 3′ downstream of transcription start sites  in addition to in 5′-upstream promoter regions. a distinct combination of dna methylation patterns at t-dmrs determines cellular identity during development
 <cit> , thus illustrating that dna methylation profiles are unique to individual cells or tissue types
 <cit> .

genome-wide dna methylation analyses focusing on proximal promoter regions in embryonic stem cell-derived npcs and npcs committed to astrocytes indicate the importance of dna methylation in the commitment process and differentiation potential of npcs
 <cit> . these reports indicated that the majority of dna methylation changes occur at low-cpg density promoters, suggesting sequence preferences in dna methylation targets during neural differentiation
 <cit> . however, t-dmrs are observed at high-cpg density promoters, such as those containing cpg islands , and are tissue-dependently methylated in the adult brain 
 <cit> .

in this study, we performed a comparative analysis of dna methylation status in npcs derived from mid- and late-gestation mouse embryo. using microarray-based, genome-wide dna methylation profiling
 <cit> , we identified t-dmrs in dozens of genes, and we illustrate dynamic dna methylation statuses for dozens of t-dmrs, which are reflected in the dna methylation profile of the adbr.

RESULTS
distinct dna methylation profiles in npcs with different fates
to explore dna methylation profiles of mouse npcs, we compared neurospheres  derived from telencephalons at embryonic days  <dig>   and  <dig>   by t-dmr profiling with restriction tag-mediated amplification  with mouse promoter tiling arrays covering from 6 kb upstream to  <dig>  kb downstream of  <dig>  gene tsss 
 <cit> . the distinctive cell fates of e <dig> nsph and e <dig> nsph were indicated by biased expression of marker genes for neural and oligodendrocyte progenitor in the undifferentiated nsph, and those of neuronal and glial marker genes in the differentiated ones, respectively . we screened genomic regions that exhibited differential matscores
 <cit>  between nsphs, which indicate differential methylation status, and obtained a total of  <dig>  nsph-t-dmrs consisting of  <dig> e11hypo-t-dmrs and  <dig>  e14hypo-t-dmrs, which were hyper- and hypomethylated, respectively, in e <dig> nsph compared to e <dig> nsph.

the localization patterns along the genome were distinct between e11hypo-t-dmrs and e14hypo-t-dmrs. the former exhibited bimodal distributions within  <dig>  kb from tsss and biased to the cgi genes, which contain cgis around tsss
 <cit> ; the latter were located 6 kb to 2 kb upstream of tsss without any promoter type bias . these findings are noteworthy because they indicate that methylation changes occur in regions around high-cpg promoters. we analyzed e11hypo-t-dmr 3′ downstream from the nrcam tss, and e14hypo-t-dmr 5′ upstream from the kat <dig> tss. combined bisulfite restriction analysis  of these t-dmrs indicated differential dna methylation status as indicated by d-ream .

among the genes with nsph-t-dmrs, we identified human gene orthologs involved in neurological diseases, such as spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig> , schizophrenia , autism , and brain malformation syndrome  . we performed bisulfite sequencing of  <dig> e11hypo-t-dmr  and  <dig> e14hypo-t-dmrs  that were located at various relative positions from the tsss, including one associated with an alternative tss and those facing their tss in proximal regions. the results showed clear differences in the dna methylation statuses of cpg sites around the hpych4iv sites between the  <dig> types of nsphs . these data indicate that methylation changes occurred in a subpopulation of nsphs in a gene-dependent manner.

association of nsph-t-dmrs with neural development and function
we performed gene ontology  analysis to characterize genes with the nsph-t-dmrs. the neural-related go term “central nervous system development” was enriched in genes with e11hypo-t-dmrs but was not enriched in those with e14hypo-t-dmrs . genes with e11hypo-t-dmrs included those for neuronal differentiation and functions: specification of retinal amacrine neurons , axon outgrowth , inhibition of oligodendrocyte differentiation , and axon guidance . among genes with e14hypo-t-dmrs, we found those involved in astrocyte and/or oligodendrocyte development, such as nfia and olig <dig>  both e11hypo- and e14hypo-t-dmr genes included those involved in cell fate commitment  and brain morphogenesis . a search of the omim  database indicated that genes with e14hypo-t-dmrs that encode membrane-associated proteins  are expressed in the adbr . thus, developmental stage-specific methylation and demethylation at the t-dmrs in genes related to neuronal and glial development occurred during neural cell fate determination.

dna methylation profile of nsph-t-dmrs in the adbr
we compared d-ream data between nsphs and the adbr and used k-means clustering to classify e11hypo- and e14hypo-t-dmrs into  <dig> clusters. in the adbr, most e11hypo-t-dmrs and e14hypo-t-dmrs exhibited hypomethylation  . although the degrees of differences varied among genes, cobra of nsph-t-dmrs indicated hypomethylated status at some loci as clusters  <dig> and  <dig> , and hypermethylated status at other loci as cluster  <dig>  in the adbr .

among genes with cluster- <dig> e14hypo-t-dmrs, we unexpectedly found that t-dmr hypermethylation was associated with higher gene expression in the brain . to address this issue, we further investigated the dna methylation status of other hpych4iv sites in these genes using adbr d-ream data and found adbr-specific hypomethylated t-dmrs 3′ downstream of their tsss in ntng <dig>  aldh1a <dig>  and accn <dig> . it is noteworthy that all these t-dmrs were located within few kb from cgis.

the positional changes of hypomethylated t-dmrs in a specific genomic region are summarized in figure 
3b. bisulfite sequencing analysis of t-dmrs in the ntng <dig> gene indicated hypermethylation of e14hypo-t-dmrs at the 5′-upstream region and hypomethylation at the 3′ downstream of the tss in the adbr with unmethylated neighboring regions in all samples . quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  data indicated negative correlation between hypomethylation at distal t-dmr  in undifferentiated nsphs, and an association of gene expression in adbr with hypomethylation of the t-dmr 3′ downstream of the cgi . these results highlight functions associated with developmental stage-dependent multiple t-dmrs in a gene region.

discussion
comparing nsphs with different cell fates enabled the identification of numerous t-dmrs in genes at different relative positions from tsss. dna methylation and demethylation occurred in a developmental stage-dependent manner, and changes in dna methylation at these t-dmrs resulted in variable methylation in adbr cells that shifted the dna methylation profile as a whole. the hypomethylated status of most nsph-t-dmrs was reflected in the dna methylation profile of the adbr to different degrees in a locus-specific manner. the previous genome-wide methylation analyses of npcs
 <cit>  emphasized preexisting epigenetic marks, such as bivalent histone modifications on poised genes involved in early differentiation processes and demethylated promoters of astrocyte-specific genes in progenitor cells preceding expression in differentiated cells. dna methylation status in nsphs and gene expression in the adbr have led to the hypothesis that a considerable number of t-dmrs identified in this study are epigenetically marked prior to gene expression. the developmental-stage specific dna methylation marks could be useful for identify and evaluation of npcs established from not only fetus but also stem cells as pluripotent stem cells and those from adult tissues.

we observed developmental position changes such as 5′ distal hypomethylated t-dmrs in the nsphs and hypomethylated t-dmr marks 3′ proximal downstream of tsss in the fully developed brain. these t-dmrs were often located around cgis, which is in contrast to a previous genome-wide analysis of npcs indicating biased dna methylation changes to low-cpg promoters
 <cit> . t-dmrs found in the ntng <dig> locus could be classified into the previously described class of t-dmrs downstream of tsss of cgi genes, in which hypomethylation was well correlated with gene expression
 <cit> . t-dmrs have been identified at the edges of cgis
 <cit> , and dmrs around cgis, named as cpg island shores, are identified in not only normal tissues but also cancer cells
 <cit> . the biased distribution of e14hypo-t-dmrs to the relatively 5′-distal positions from tsss suggested that hypomethylation of these 5′-distal t-dmrs in the progenitor cells are epigenetic marks that lead to expression in differentiated cells, which exhibit hypomethylation of t-dmrs at 3′ downstream of tss.

systematic biases are inevitable for any genome-wide dna methylation analysis: both microarray-based integrated analysis of methylation by isoschizomers 
 <cit>  and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing 
 <cit> , methods used in the previous epigenomic study in npcs, are inevitably focusing on cgis because of the biased distribution of mspi recognition sites that they uses for enrichment of fragments
 <cit> ; methylated dna immunoprecipitation 
 <cit> , is known to have bias to high density cpg promoter
 <cit> . approximately 50% of promoters are associated with cgis. d-ream also has
 <cit> . only limited numbers of genes are coincided to be predicted to have dmrs in nsph: gfap, which have been shown to have dmr hypomethylated in e <dig> nsph
 <cit> , was not included in our gene list because of lacking hpych4iv site in the proximal promoter region: dmrs on ntng <dig>  which was identified in this study, is an example of novel t-dmrs not described in the previous studies.

several converging lines of evidence have indicated the significance of dna methylation in normal brain function. mutations in dnmt <dig>  dnmt3b, and mecp <dig> result in functional and/or morphological abnormalities in human and mouse brain
 <cit> . mutations in the human orthologs of some genes carrying nsph-t-dmr, such as lig <dig> and nfia, are associated with neurological disorders
 <cit> . similar phenotypes are observed in mice harboring mutations in these genes
 <cit> . targeted mutation of  <dig> genes with e11hypo-t-dmrs, dclk <dig> and nrcam, results in axonal defects in mice
 <cit> . disorganized dna methylation profiles have been reported in cloned animals
 <cit> , chemically treated cells
 <cit> , and in certain diseases
 <cit> . epimutations in tumor suppressor genes are involved in carcinogenesis
 <cit> . therefore, the establishment of dna methylation status at t-dmrs in these genes indicates the possibility that epimutations at t-dmrs could be involved in neurological disorders without genetic alterations.

CONCLUSIONS
the dynamics of t-dmrs, several of which are often identified around tss of a single gene during neural development, contribute regulation of developmental expression of genes and the dna methylation profile of mouse adult brain. the identified t-dmrs could be used for evaluation and identification of npcs, and for epimutation analysis in neural diseases.
