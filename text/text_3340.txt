BACKGROUND
the rapid increase of world population, the field degradation by soil salinization and erosion, and the likely fluctuations in climate caused by global warming will pose new and known challenges to agriculture during this century  <cit> . crop improvements required to cope with these challenges could be attained through agronomic advances, leading to a better use of fertilizers, protection agents or soil rescue, and exploitation of recent technologies for plant breeding. despite the outstanding importance of genetics-based breeding applied to spontaneous mutations and conventional hybrids, molecular and genomic tools are expected to develop their great potential for crop improvement through functional genetics analysis, involving gene and function discovery and genome modification.

citrus, some of the most important fruit crops worldwide, are perennial trees requiring a juvenility period of several years and frequently are parthenocarpic and sexually self-incompatible  <cit> , which considerably impairs traditional breeding. genomic technology, including methods to rapidly identify and manipulate genes of agricultural interest, holds promise of improvements that may be difficult through traditional approaches. in recent years, citrus has been the target of several genomic developments including large est collections  <cit> , cdna and oligonucleotide-based microarrays  <cit> , bac libraries and bac end sequencing  . however, functional studies, i.e. genetic transformation and the capability to perform reverse genetic analyses, are also considerably impaired. in citrus, high throughput transgenic programs such as the generation of rna interference knockouts, activation tagging through enhancer elements, gene-trap t-dna insertions, or transposon tagging systems have not been developed yet. since no efficient tagging or insertional procedures are available in these species, other gene disruption methods including strategies based on genome-wide mutagenesis such as tilling and fast neutron mutagenesis have been initiated. these approaches are non-transgenic and may have particular interest for the industry where the debate on genetically modified organisms has restricted application of these technologies to crop improvement. both approaches, however, are of limited usefulness as strategies for reverse genetics because of the lack of knowledge on citrus genomic sequence and the large amount of space required for the establishment of mutant populations. ecotilling on natural citrus variants and microarray-based detection of deletions in fast neutron citrus mutants are apparently very straightforward approaches. in this work we explore the potential of this last idea using two fast neutron citrus clementina hemizygous mutants from the ivia collection and a 20k cdna citrus microarray.

physical mutagenesis through fast neutron irradiation has been reported to cause variable genomic deletions ranging in size from few base pairs to  <dig> kb in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . several approaches have been used to characterize plant genomic deletions at the molecular level. these mostly include positional cloning  <cit> , a method applicable to any kind of genetic lesion that, however, needs highly saturated genetic maps; pcr-based reverse genetics techniques  <cit> , requiring a previous considerable knowledge of genomic sequence; and genomic subtraction procedures  <cit> , which do not need sequence information but are strongly dependent on the gene dosage. since very little is known about citrus genome sequence and the citrus induced deletions are in hemizygous gene dosage, an array-based procedure as the one employed for identifying homozygous gene deletions in arabidopsis  <cit>  seems more suitable for our purpose than those methods. although the main application of microarrays is transcriptome profiling analysis, microarrays can also be used to study dna variation. oligonucleotide arrays are particularly suited for the detection of single nucleotide mismatches during hybridization, and hence for the discovery of novel dna variants or the determination of known variants. the origin of this technique relies on a cytogenetic method described  <dig> years ago named "comparative genomic hybridization"  that used differential dna hybridization on chromosome spreads for visualization of deleted or amplified genomic regions in tumour tissues  <cit> . subsequently, different laboratories mostly working on cancer research independently applied microarray technology to genomic dna hybridization procedure, a technique consequently named array-cgh  <cit> . array-cgh was successfully utilized to detect gene duplications in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> , and to validate aneuploidy analysis performed by quantitative fluorescent pcr in arabidopsis  <cit> . therefore, this method has proven to be suitable to study chromosomal imbalances in plants.

for the characterization of the deleted regions we also leaned on comparative genomics with other dicots since available physical citrus maps are not yet integrated with known genetic maps. comparative genomics takes advantage of available information on gene content and order in genomic dna from different species to infer phylogenetic relationships and formulate hypotheses on dna evolutionary dynamics. whole genomes are preferentially compared when available, but more often relatively short stretches of dna or polymorphic markers are used.

the main objective of this work was to identify deleted genes on a heterozygous genetic citrus background, provided by fast neutron generated mutants, through array-comparative genomic hybridization. in addition, we also explored the possibility of using comparative genomics with annotated dicot genomes assisted by bac end sequencing for the generation of partial physical maps of the deleted citrus regions.

RESULTS
procedure for the characterization of hemizygous deletions in citrus
the proposed procedure to identify deleted genes is illustrated in figure  <dig> and its potential to structurally characterize hemizygous deletions is exemplified below with citrus mutants as starting plant material. its usefulness to describe genomic deletions in other species might be dependent upon genome complexity and ploidy. this method uses cdna microarrays to hybridize genomic dna extracted from the deletion mutants to render a list of underrepresented genes. the putative deleted genes are then validated through gene dosage evaluation by real-time pcr using gene specific primers. deleted genes could subsequently contribute to the identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes by means of a candidate gene approach, validated by physiological analyses or genetic transformation  <cit> . in non-sequenced genomes or in plants with poorly developed physical maps, further characterization of deletions at the structural level requires tblastx similarity searches against databases containing the sequence annotation of known eudicot genomes, such as arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa and vitis vinifera. these searches yield putative orthologous genes and syntenic genomic regions between these four species. local physical maps of deletions are built allocating the deleted gene sequences and the syntenic genomic fragments from these other eudicots into a bes database of the species of interest. lastly, specific pcr on the array of bacs confirms gene content and order on the lineal structure of the deletions. the results may also be used in comparative genomics analyses to study evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetics.

identification of deleted alleles in 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> fast neutron mutants of citrus clementina
for this study, two mutants obtained by fast neutron mutagenesis of wild type citrus clementina were selected from the ivia mutant collection. these mutants, named 39b <dig> and 39e <dig>  were expected to carry dna deletion lesions in hemizygous dosage and showed a delay in natural colour break in fruit peel. the 39b <dig> mutant exhibited a delay in colour change from green to orange while 39e <dig> was better characterized by an abnormal final yellowish colour instead of the natural orange coloration. putative deleted genes in the mutants were first identified through an approach based on genomic hybridization  that exploited a recently developed citrus microarray containing  <dig> cdnas  <cit> . to this end, total genomic dna from four independent samples of mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> were cy <dig> or cy5-labelled and cohybridized with wild type dna labelled with the complementary cy <dig> or cy <dig> probe on four independent microarray slides. fluorescence intensity data were normalized and single ests showing a mutant/wild type signal ratio lower than  <dig>  fold, with a p-value lower than  <dig>   or  <dig>  , were selected as putative candidates.

the number of ests fulfilling these criteria was  <dig> and  <dig> for mutants 39b <dig> and 39e <dig>  respectively. one of the 39b <dig> positives , composed of three unrelated sequences was discarded for subsequent analysis due to its chimerical nature. in order to validate the array-cgh results, gene dosage of several putative candidates was determined through real-time pcr quantification of mutant/wild type signals for candidate ests as related to a reference undeleted gene . the results showed that gene dosage for 39b <dig> candidates ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when genomic dna from the 39b <dig> genotype was tested, while ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when the assayed dna originated from the 39e <dig> genotype . similar results, corroborating the presence of putative deleted genes at half dosage, were also obtained for the 39e <dig> mutant. therefore, the developed array-cgh procedure proved to be an appropriate tool to identify genes in hemizygous content in the self-incompatible clementine.

accession numbers and the corresponding assembled unigenes for several candidate ests are shown. array-cgh data are signal ratios of mutant with respect to wild type samples for each single est. gene dosage was calculated through real-time pcr on 39b <dig> and 39e <dig> genomic templates. a horizontal line separates array-cgh hits of 39b <dig> mutant  from those of the 39e <dig> mutant .

clustering of homologues of citrus deleted genes in the poplar genome
microsynteny comparisons with homologous stretches from the sequenced genomes of arabidopsis thaliana, populus trichocarpa and vitis vinifera  <cit>  were performed in order to elucidate hypothetical clustering of citrus deleted genes in the genome. tblastx, which searches for translations of a crude genome similar to a translated query, was utilized with an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig>  the homologous regions produced by the best tblastx hit of each of the citrus candidate genes were located on the chromosome maps of arabidopsis, poplar and grapevine. homologues of citrus genes were then grouped into clusters in each species when the distance between them was shorter than  <dig> kb. the second and third tblastx best alignments were similarly placed in the respective maps when they were included in an existing cluster. in this case, a binding line was drawn linking the second and third hits to the best hit of the same citrus query. thus, two chromosomal maps, one for each mutant, in the three species was obtained. figure  <dig> represents in detail chromosome mappings of the 39b <dig> mutation, which was subjected to further analyses. the results indicate that the populus mapping exhibited rather lower complexity than the arabidopsis and grapevine ones since it included fewer chromosomes and only  <dig> clusters although the number of 39b <dig> candidate genes represented in the map was identical  for the three genomes. note that the number of represented hits in these mappings is higher than  <dig> due to the inclusion of second or third homologues. in populus, most of the candidate genes mapped to two different genome regions of approximately  <dig> kb long in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  two duplicated chromosomes that probably originated during the recent genome duplication event that occurred in this species  <cit> . these two clusters contained  <dig> and  <dig> hits respectively while the third one placed in chromosome  <dig> had only one hit. in contrast, the number of clusters in arabidopsis and vitis were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and none of them contained more than  <dig> hits. furthermore, cluster number  of the homologues of 39e <dig> putative deleted genes was also lower  in populus than in arabidopsis or vitis, although the differences were smaller:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clusters were obtained for poplar, arabidopsis and grapevine respectively .

overall, these observations suggest that the populus genomic regions homologous to the citrus deletions were less fragmented than their counterparts in arabidopsis and vitis, and consequently microsynteny on the considered segments was higher with the populus genome. these results are striking since citrus and arabidopsis belong to sapindales and brassicales orders  while populus is included in the eurosids i clade, and vitis is part of vitaceae, a family outside of rosids  <cit> .

gene arrangement and partial physical map of the 39b <dig> deletion
the closer microsynteny observed between the 39b <dig> deletion and the two duplicated homologous regions in poplar enabled prediction of gene order by direct inference from the populus sequences. this assumption led to the gene arrangement depicted in figure  <dig>  twenty genes out of twenty-one having high similarity with populus homologues were directly located on the citrus deletion fragment by combining the two clusters found on populus chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  which shared  <dig> hits. inclusion of the 21st gene, a homologue of a populus gene placed on chromosome  <dig>  in the 39b <dig> deletion was based on its location on the right end of the citrus bac ccer1019d <dig> , whose left end shared identity with another deleted gene . the accession number and protein similarity of these  <dig> genes, numbered according to the ordered position of their homologues on the poplar genome , are depicted in table  <dig> that also shows coding strand sense of poplar homologues. the coding strand was coincident for the populus paralogous genes present in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  except for genes similar to citrus cx <dig>  located in position  <dig> in figure  <dig> 

unigenes are numbered according to the ordered position of their homologues on the poplar genome. the accession numbers correspond to 39b <dig> candidate ests. the coding frame of populus homologues follow the proposed strand  or the complementary reverse one .

furthermore, the recent sequencing of  <dig>  citrus clementina bac ends  enabled the construction of a physical map of the 39b <dig> deleted region. to this end, two dna sequences covering  <dig> kb along the populus chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  containing the genes homologous to the citrus deleted candidates, were blasted against the citrus bac end database. the homology search identified  <dig> bacs with a blastn e value lower than 10- <dig> for both paralogous regions. in subsequent analyses, redundant bacs were discarded, while additional candidate bacs were obtained by comparing these previous ones with the bes database to yield overlapping bacs. moreover, bacs with both ends showing similarity to repetitive dna that may cause ambiguous positioning and inaccurate gene dosage measurement were also discarded. finally, a partial physical map containing  <dig> bacs systematically named b <dig> to b <dig>  was provided by standard pcr of bac end amplicons against bac templates and in silico search of overlapping antiparallel ends .

bacs are numbered according to the ordered position in the deletion from b <dig> to b <dig>  bes are named with the number of the bac plus "-l" for left end and "-r" for right end according to the drawing orientation in figure 5b. nhf: no hits found.

this mapping contained three gaps, one at the 5' deletion junction and two internal ones  delimiting three main bac clusters, composed of b <dig> to b <dig>  b <dig> to b <dig>  and b <dig> to b <dig>  bacs b <dig> and b <dig> were connected by unigene acl4690contig <dig> coding for a putative subunit clpd of an atp-dependent clp protease, whose sequence was shared by both bacs. similarly b <dig> and b <dig> interaction is mediated by unigene acl1915contig <dig> . real-time pcr quantification of gene dosage for some of the bac ends  confirmed the presence of these sequences at half dosage in the mutant genotype, indicating that the 39b <dig> mutation is a hemizygous deletion. indeed, all analyzed bacs covered an internal segment of the deletion except b <dig> that exhibited haploid gene dosage on the left end and diploid dosage on the right one, suggesting that b <dig> contained the 3' border of the 39b <dig> deletion.

the above results indicated that the microsynteny between citrus and populus genomes was high enough to predict gene arrangement and to build a partial physical map of a citrus genomic segment of about  <dig> kb, as inferred from the length of poplar homologous regions. nevertheless, the observation that a  <dig> kb citrus fragment only contains  <dig> genes may result striking considering an average distance of  <dig> kb between adjacent genes, as deduced from the estimations of citrus genome size  and gene number . it should be noted, however, that the microarray used in these analyses contains between approximately 2/ <dig> and 1/ <dig> of the estimated gene content of the citrus genome, which may account for a major part of the hypothetical "loss" of deleted candidates. while this is a weakness of the currently available citrus arrays, non-attributable to the array-cgh procedure, more complete results are expected after the development of a more representative cdna microarray. other limitations of the method may be related to the differential hybridization potential of different cdnas, including for instance cross-hybridizations. in this regard, oligonucleotide arrays are particularly suited for the detection of dissimilar dna variants. alternatively, synteny might be limited to several genes located on a bulk of non-conserved sequences inside this  <dig> kb region, a possibility that may only be corroborated after genome sequencing.

overall, the data indicated that the populus genome is a useful model for comparative genomics which may be used to characterize hemizygous deletions in citrus.

the citrus 39b <dig> deletion shows higher local gene colinearity with populus than with arabidopsis
local gene colinearity between two genomic fragments is determined by the number of paralogous genes arranged in the same order. therefore, not only permanence of genes in their original chromosomal location, but also conservation of gene order, affects local colinearity. in order to validate the gene arrangement postulated in figure  <dig> and consequently to estimate gene colinearity of the 39b <dig> citrus deletion with populus homologous fragments, we mapped by pcr the  <dig> genes listed in table  <dig> on the physical map of figure 5b. all but three genes showed at least one pcr product on the array of  <dig> bacs, confirming that those genes were effectively included in the 39b <dig> deletion . in addition, pcr reactions reproduced at the bac size resolution the expected gene order outlined in figure  <dig>  corroborating the gene arrangement deduced by comparative genomics. in figure 6b, the genes rendering a positive pcr signal were linked to the physical map position with an arrow. moreover, genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> corresponding to unigenes acl3991contig <dig>  ac18005f10rv_c and ac16014f08sk_c, respectively, did not show a detectable pcr signal on purified bacs, although their respective primers produced a band of the expected size when tested against genomic dna from normal clementine cultivar . these genes were most likely placed into the two reported internal gaps of the physical map, as suggested by the border situation of their neighbouring genes.

these results confirm high local gene colinearity with poplar in the genomic region covered by 39b <dig> deletion. taking together gene content and order conservation , it is inferred that in the studied dna deleted segment there was higher gene colinearity with populus, which diverged about  <dig> million years ago , than with arabidopsis, splitting from the citrus lineage about  <dig> mya  <cit> , despite gene colinearity generally being correlated with phylogenetic relatedness. a similar conclusion has been reached in our group, after comparing the whole collection of citrus bes with the poplar and arabidopsis genomes , and also in previous works in papaya and melon. in papaya, bes alignment to the annotated genomes rendered higher gene colinearity with populus than with arabidopsis, although both arabidopsis and papaya belong to the order brassicales  <cit> . in melon, microsynteny studies based on the sequence of two bacs also concluded that melon was closer to populus than to arabidopsis or medicago truncatula  <cit> . these observations may be explained by a differential genome evolutionary dynamics in poplar and arabidopsis lineages  <cit> . the more recent appraisals estimated that last whole genome duplications occurred not later than 60– <dig> mya in populus and around 24– <dig> mya in arabidopsis lineages  <cit> . despite the older poplar event, genome rearrangements involving gene loss and translocation following these duplications were much more frequent in arabidopsis ancestors  <cit> . such a highly active genome dynamics probably caused the dispersion of genes and the subsequent reduction in synteny and gene colinearity with even related species. the different behaviour of populus and arabidopsis ancestral genomes still deserves further explanation. it has been suggested that woody long-lived species like poplar trees may undergo a slower genome dynamics due to their juvenile period that delays sexual fecundation for several years and to the recurrent contribution of gametes from aged individuals of previous generations  <cit> . in addition, species like arabidopsis thaliana may have very active mechanisms for unequal or illegitimate recombination causing frequent chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, insertions and deletions. in this context, it is notable that nearly all citrus species and many related genera have 2n =  <dig>  probably indicating slow chromosomal evolution in this group.

chlorophyll a/b ratio is modified in 39b <dig> mutant
structural studies describing gene arrangement on a particular deletion have outstanding importance for linking a specific mutant phenotype with an impaired gene. the 39b <dig> deletion removed at least a set of  <dig> genes and resulted in delayed chlorophyll catabolism. although in principle, no obvious candidate genes could be unequivocally related to the exocarp colour break retardation, the 39b <dig> mutant certainly exhibited altered chlorophyll a and b content. ratios of chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b contents in 39b <dig> mutant were about 15% to 23% lower than those found in wild type when three different green tissues were tested: fruit exocarp, old and young leaves . this distinct chlorophyll composition was not accompanied by alterations in the total content of chlorophylls in the leaves although pigment levels in 39b <dig> fruit exocarp, as expected, were clearly higher  than in the peel of control fruit  that has initiated chlorophyll degradation . the chlorophyll accumulation observed in the 39b <dig> exocarp, however, is higher than the maximum reached in normal clementine fruits   <cit> , suggesting that the mutation also induced total chlorophyll build-up in the fruit peel. indeed, fruit exocarps of a "wild type" clementine tree showing fruit colour delay due to altered environmental conditions showed chlorophyll a/b ratios equivalent to those found in the standard cultivar  while total pigments had an intermediate value  between those of normal and 39b <dig> genotypes .

total chlorophyll content  was measured in young and old leaves and fruit peel exocarp from samples shown in figure  <dig>  data are average of  <dig>  or  <dig>  independent determinations. standard deviation is shown.

unigene acl766contig <dig>  one of the 39b <dig> hits validated by real-time quantitative pcr  coding for a clpc-like protein, may have certain relevance to the altered chlorophyll composition found in 39b <dig> mutant. plant clpcs are atp-binding proteins located in the stroma of chloroplasts which have been found to be associated with the protein import machinery  <cit>  and with the clp protease complex  <cit> . in fact, clpc has been related to protein translocation across the chloroplast inner envelope membrane and to multiple processes requiring proteolytic cleavage, as protein turnover and regulation  <cit> . in arabidopsis, insertional mutagenesis in the clpc <dig> gene caused chlorosis, growth retardation, photosynthetic damage and defects in chloroplast protein import  <cit>  and no double knock-outs of clpc <dig> and the less expressed clpc <dig> genes were obtained, suggesting that clpc function is essential in plants  <cit> . in addition, a mutant impaired in clpc <dig> mrna processing accumulated chlorophyllide a oxygenase protein , a key enzyme for the synthesis of chlorophyll b from chlorophyll a, leading to a reduced chlorophyll a/b ratio  <cit> . interestingly, acl4690contig <dig> unigene coding for another subunit of clp complexes  with sequence similarity to acl766contig <dig> showed half gene dosage  and was also included in the 39b <dig> deletion. expression of both clpc-like and clpd-like genes was analyzed in fruit exocarps from wild type and 39b <dig> mutant at two different developmental stages: green immature peel  and shortly after the time of natural colour break in wild type peel . both genes showed reduced expression in the 39b <dig> mutant, an observation that was well correlated with the alteration in chlorophyll composition since clpc-like and clpd-like alleles in the hemizygous 39b <dig> mutant reached about a half of the expression values found in the wild type . these results suggest that wild type alleles are similarly expressed in the peel of clementine fruit. furthermore, sequencing of the clpc-like gene that according to its arabidopsis homologue plays a major role in chlorophyll composition, also revealed that there were no essential differences between wild type and 39b <dig> mutant coding regions . this observation corroborated that not only expression but also protein sequence were identical in the analyzed clpc-like alleles. in the wild type, three single nucleotide polymorphisms  were observed in two different introns, which were very likely unable to alter protein stability or function. these single base variants that were detected as sequence ambiguities  were due to the presence of overlapping base peaks contributed by both alleles, while hemizygous clpc-like gene in 39b <dig> mutant produced an unambiguous signal in the same positions. bases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> located on the forth and sixth introns were identified as guanine, guanine and adenine in the mutant, while a mix of guanine and thymine, guanine and adenine and adenine and thymine were respectively found in wild type dna . while the contribution of the clpc-like gene dosage to the retardation of the natural exocarp degreening remains to be unequivocally demonstrated, the data presented above clearly shows that there is a strong correlation between chlorophyll composition and the presence of a single allele in the mutant. additional analysis of the remaining genes inside 39b <dig> deletion should be performed in order to accomplish a complete candidate gene approach

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we propose a procedure for the genetic characterization of genomic hemizygous deletions in citrus mutants. the procedure that might be applied to other non-sequenced species of similar genome size and ploidy level is illustrated with the study of the 39b <dig> citrus clementina deletion, generated by fast neutron bombardment. the proposed strategy utilizes several genomic resources such as array-comparative genomic hybridization  technology, est and bac end sequencing databases and poplar genome annotation.

the array-cgh results led to the conclusion that the 39b <dig> deletion removed at least  <dig> genes while a partial physical map of about  <dig> kb of the deleted region was inferred by comparison of two homologous genomic regions from poplar with a citrus bes database.

structural data including gene content and order in the deletion was utilized for microsynteny and local gene colinearity studies concluding that in the studied region citrus is more similar to populus than to arabidopsis, a phylogenetically closer species. this observation supports previous works on other species and suggests that the arabidopsis lineage underwent a quicker genome evolutionary dynamics than the populus one.

among the deleted alleles, the function of clpc-like, coding for a putative subunit of a protease involved in chlorophyll b synthesis was directly related to the mutant phenotype since green mutant tissues had a lower chlorophyll a/b ratio.
