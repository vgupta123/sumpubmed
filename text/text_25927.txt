BACKGROUND
the bacterium paenibacillus sp. jdr- <dig>  originally isolated from sweetgum wood  disks exposed to surface soils has been shown to completely utilize the lignocellulosic polymer glucuronoxylan . previous studies showed that growth on minimal media supplemented with polymeric xylan was preferred to that on simple sugars such as xylose, glucose, or arabinose  <cit> . these studies indicated that efficient xylan utilization is attributable, in part, to a 157 kda gh <dig> β- <dig> -endoxylanase  containing carbohydrate binding modules  for binding to polysaccharides and surface layer homology  domains for cell-association. the efficiency of utilization was such that the products of xylan hydrolysis were rapidly assimilated as they were formed  <cit> . these early findings suggest that pjdr <dig> utilizes glucuronoxylan in a vectorial manner with an unidentified mechanism for coupling surface localized polymer hydrolysis to rapid oligoxyloside transport into the cell.

pcr screening for genes encoding enzymes typically involved in utilization of gxn led to the identification of the aldouronate utilization gene cluster . this cluster of genes encodes three intracellular glycoside hydrolases, a gh <dig> α-glucuronidase, a gh <dig> endoxylanase and a gh <dig> β-xylosidase , as well as regulatory proteins and abc  transporters . through in silico analysis this gene cluster is predicted to contain multiple promoters and catabolite repression elements  although the entire region has only a single detected terminator following the last gene, xyn43b <dig>  importantly, the aldouronate utilization gene cluster was coordinately regulated with the distally located xyn10a <dig>  supporting the role of this large surface anchored xylanase in membrane localized glucuronoxylan hydrolysis  <cit> . more recent studies showed that pjdr <dig> utilized polymeric gxn at a rate  <dig>  times higher than the gxn derived aldouronate, aldotetrauronic acid, suggesting a functional coupling of primary xylan hydrolysis to oligosaccharide transport into the cell  <cit> .fig.  <dig> polysaccharide utilization regulons in pjdr <dig>  genomic organization of xylan utilization genes  assigned a role in xylan utilization in pjdr <dig>  for a complete list see additional file  <dig>  <cit> . genetic organization of barley β-glucan  and starch  utilization regulons consisting of genes encoding extracellular multi-modular cell-associated or secreted glycoside hydrolases for depolymerization, abc transporters for assimilation of the generated oligosaccharides, and intracellular glycoside hydrolases for further processing and metabolism. sbp, solute binding protein; imp, inner membrane protein; bpd, binding protein dependent; gh, glycoside hydrolase. locus tag annotated as pjdr2_#### abbreviated to only consist of the numeric portion, ####



analysis of the sequenced genome  <cit>  for carbohydrate active enzymes  through the cazy database   <cit>  identified a number of genes encoding enzymes predicted to be involved in xylan utilization. these include five genes encoding gh <dig> and one encoding gh <dig> xylanases with expected, and in three cases demonstrated, endo-β- <dig> -xylanase activity for xylan main chain hydrolysis. genes encoding accessory enzymes for xylan depolymerization including β-xylosidases, α-glucuronidases, α-l-arabinofuranosidases, and acetyl esterases are also predicted to be numerous. for example, the genome of pjdr <dig> contains  <dig> genes encoding a broad class of gh <dig> enzymes including β-xylosidases and α-l-arabinofuranosidases. there are also four genes encoding α-glucuronidases of which three are in the gh <dig> family and one in the gh <dig> family. recombinant enzymes encoded by several of these genes have been characterized  <cit> . several other cazy families commonly involved in xylan utilization are also highly represented. the cumulative potential xylan degrading capacity of pjdr <dig> supports its demonstrated abilities for complete xylan utilization.

more recent efforts have focused on transcriptomic analysis of pjdr <dig> while growing on xylan substrates. proteins involved in xylan utilization were identified based on gene expression levels  <cit> . primary findings of that study revealed that pjdr <dig> secretes only two endoxylanases for xylan depolymerization. the resulting mixture of oligosaccharides generated by xyn10a <dig>  <cit>  and xyn <dig>  consists of neutral oligoxylosides and, depending on the xylan type, a mixture of substituted xylooligosaccharides including aldouronates and similarly substituted oligoarabinoxylosides. genes predicted to encode abc transporters were found to have increased transcript levels during growth on xylans and it was proposed that these enable transport of this complex mixture of oligoxylosides into the cell for intracellular hydrolysis to monomeric sugars for catabolism . the observed high expression level of genes encoding intracellular oligosaccharide degrading accessory enzymes during growth on xylans supported this hypothesis . comparative transcriptomics following growth of pjdr <dig> on dicot-derived hardwood  gxn and a monocot-derived grass  glucuronoarabinoxylan  indicated that systems with distinct enzymes and abc transporters are employed for utilization of oligoarabinoxylosides as compared to aldouronates  <cit> .

based on the earlier physiological characterization and the most recent transcriptomic study, the proposed model for xylan utilization indicates that pjdr <dig> relies on transport and intracellular degradation of xylooligosaccharides. this system in pjdr <dig> shows similarity to the polymeric sugar utilization by other bacteria including geobacillus, thermotoga and clostridium  and stands in contrast to the more classical paradigm for fungi that requires complete extracellular conversion of polysaccharides to monosaccharides  <cit> . the role of the cell-associated endoxylanase in the xylan utilization systems represents an alternative paradigm to that observed in cellulolytic bacteria such as clostridium thermocellum in which glycoside hydrolases comprise a cell-associated complex as opposed to individual enzymes .

recent studies show that pjdr <dig> is also capable of efficient utilization of other biomass derived polysaccharides including barley β-glucan and starch  <cit> . genome analysis indicates that these polysaccharide utilization systems include extracellular glycoside hydrolases with modular architecture for cell-association and carbohydrate binding. we present here an overview of a broad transcriptomic study characterizing pjdr <dig> gene regulation in response to growth on barley β-glucan and starch as well as their constituent disaccharide sugars, cellobiose and maltose. the results are additionally considered in regards to the previously studied xylan-utilization system, providing a comparison of these three polysaccharide-utilization systems with respect to transport and catabolism of the products of depolymerization as well as their monosaccharide constituents. comparison of these three polysaccharide utilization systems of pjdr <dig> indicate a reliance upon cell-associated glycoside hydrolases with cbm’s for interacting with polysaccharides and slh domains for cell-association. furthermore, identification of  <dig> genes within the pjdr <dig> genome encoding proteins involved in carbohydrate utilization that contain sets of slh domains supports an evolutionary path leading to the secretion of cell-associated glycoside hydrolases. this system is efficient in the depolymerization of polysaccharides at the cell surface and is found in pjdr <dig> as well as related bacteria including clostridium , caldicellulosiruptor  <cit>  and thermoanaerobacter  <cit> .

RESULTS
experimental design
for this transcriptome study, we sought a greater understanding of how pjdr <dig> utilizes polymeric sugars. genome analysis and polysaccharide growth studies supported efficient utilization of the polysaccharides soluble β-glucan and starch. through bioconversion these abundant biomass-derived sugar polymers may contribute to the production of value-added chemical or fuels. to obtain a broad understanding of how these polysaccharides are utilized by pjdr <dig>  total rna was prepared from early-mid exponentially growing cultures growing on these polysaccharides as well as their limit enzymatic hydrolysis products and their constituent simple sugars. the sample preparation and rna-seq data acquisition portions of this work overlap with a recently published xylan utilization transcriptome and the results presented here are compared with this earlier work to provide perspective, draw conclusions and identify themes which define the efficient manner in which pjdr <dig> utilizes polysaccharides  <cit> . the saccharides used in the study that provided the final comparative data set include barley β-glucan  and cellobiose  representing β-configured glucans, starch  and maltose  representing α-configured glucans, sweetgum glucuronoxylan  and sorghum glucuronoarabinoxylan  representing different xylan types and the constituent monosaccharides of these polysaccharides, including glucose , xylose  and arabinose . further, each condition was routinely compared to a yeast extract  control condition which consisted of  <dig>  % ye without added carbohydrate and a sweetgum xylan with no ye  control. throughout the manuscript where specific genes are considered, their respective transcript levels or their encoded proteins are routinely identified with an accompanying abbreviated locus tag accession number consisting of the four digit number, e. g. the locus tag pjdr2_ <dig> would be described as  <dig>  the total data set normalized rpkm  values were compared by fold changes taken from the ratio of the condition in consideration over the ye control condition unless otherwise stated. data was judged to be significant given a 4-fold change and a p-value, <  <dig> .

genes involved in barley β-glucan utilization
recent studies have shown that pjdr <dig> may utilize soluble β-glucans  <cit> . barley β-glucan consists of a linear polysaccharide chain of β- <dig>  linked glucose frequently and regularly interrupted with β- <dig> -linked glucose  <cit> . this polysaccharide lacks side chain substitutions such as those found in xylan, hence the extracellular degradation of barley-β-glucan is correspondingly less complex, presumably requiring fewer enzymes. the genome of pjdr <dig> encodes three gh <dig> enzymes  annotated as licheninases or laminarinases through domain analysis. all three enzymes are predicted to be secreted and while one consists of a singular gh <dig> catalytic module, the other two have an extensive multimodular architecture. both of these modular enzymes  contain triplicate n-terminal slh domains, presumably for cell surface localization, and multiple cbm’s similar to those observed for the xyn10a <dig> enzyme involved in xylan utilization .

during growth on barley-β-glucan, the genes encoding the multimodular bgl16a <dig>  and the non-modular bgl16a <dig>  increased 80-fold and 25-fold respectively compared to growth on the yeast extract control  not supplemented with carbohydrate . the bgl16a <dig> gene  encoding the second large multimodular gh <dig> enzyme is expressed only at low levels on all substrates tested. bgl16a <dig> shares 34 % amino acid similarity with the catalytic domain of the gh <dig> laminarinase from thermotoga maritima   <cit>  and bgl16a <dig> shares 71 % similarity to a probable licheninase from bacillus subtilis    <cit> . in support of these annotations, recombinant bgl16a <dig> has been shown to have activity against barley β-glucan and laminarin as both substrates contain the requisite β- <dig> -glucan linkage while recombinant bgl16a <dig> shows its highest activity on barley β-glucan  <cit> .table  <dig> expression analysis of polysaccharide processing genes during growth on barley β-glucan, starch and maltose

hydrolysis of barley β-glucan with gh <dig> laminarinase and licheninase enzymes is expected to liberate β- <dig> / <dig>  mixed linkage glucooligosaccharides. increased transcript levels for two predicted abc transporter gene cassettes were observed during growth on barley β-glucan compared to the ye control. the first cassette consisting of genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  flanks the enzyme encoding genes bgl16a <dig> and bgl16a <dig> described above and showed greater than a 1200-fold increase in transcript levels during growth on barley β-glucan . these barley β-glucan utilization genes constitute an apparent operon specifically responsive to growth on soluble β- <dig>  -glucans and no other tested substrate. this operon is directly linked to a β-glucan-responsive set of putative transcriptional regulators  located immediately upstream but transcribed in the opposite direction. together, these seven genes,  <dig> through  <dig>  constitute the glucan utilization gene cluster . the second abc transporter gene cassette consisting of genes  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> has increased expression on barley β-glucan and was also increased on xylan  <cit> . this overlapping regulation will be discussed below.table  <dig> expression analysis of genes encoding abc transporters during growth on barley β-glucan, starch, cellobiose and maltose

comparison of the barley β-glucan utilization system described here to the xylan utilization system described previously  <cit>  implies a missing enzymatic component for barley β-glucan utilization. pjdr <dig> appears to transport the mixed linkage oligosaccharide products of the two secreted gh <dig> endoglucanases in a manner similar to xylan utilization. however, unlike the defined intracellular oligosaccharide processing in the xylan utilization systems, there is no clear evidence for increased expression of genes encoding enzymes for intracellular hydrolysis of glucooligosaccharides contributing to the barley β-glucan utilization system. genome analysis has identified several genes encoding enzymes which could be involved in the further processing of intracellular glucooligosaccharides , but none of these genes are confidently assigned to this role based on the transcriptomic data. one candidate, gene  <dig>  encoding an intracellular gh <dig> β-glucosidase attains elevated transcript levels with growth on barley-β-glucan and cellobiose. the comparatively high expression level on ye resulted in a limited relative increase of just  <dig> -fold with barley β-glucan, although compared to growth on arabinose or glucose this gene had a  <dig> and  <dig> -fold increase in expression, respectively .

genes with increased expression during growth on cellobiose
cellobiose is thought to represent a primary limit product of mixed linkage β-glucan utilization and was chosen for study to discriminate between utilization of the barley β-glucan polymer and its hydrolysis products. cellobiose as a growth substrate results in increased expression of several genes encoding putative abc transporters in pjdr <dig>  the genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show greater than 118-fold increase in expression on cellobiose relative to ye. both glucose and barley β-glucan also induce the genes encoding this transporter although to a lower extent . from the transcriptome data it is not known precisely how cellobiose is converted to glucose for entry into glycolysis. as detailed above for the intracellular processing of glucooligosaccharides resulting from barley β-glucan utilization the putative intracellular gh <dig> β-glucosidase  may serve this role. this gene is expressed on cellobiose at nearly the same increased level as found with growth on barley β-glucan relative to other sugars, but not ye . in addition, gene  <dig> encoding a putative intracellular β-xylosidase  that was earlier predicted to be involved in xylan utilization due to its 100-fold increase on xylan relative to ye  is found in this work to be increased 177-fold during growth on cellobiose  <cit>  . this gene may encode the enzyme primarily responsible for hydrolysis of cellobiose. if so, this putative xylosidase either has dual substrate specificity or it actually encodes a gh <dig> β-glucosidase the expression of which is induced by cellobiose and to a lesser extent xylobiose. the gh <dig> family does not as yet contain an enzyme with a reported β-glucosidase activity. the expression of xyn43b <dig> is also increased on barley β-glucan by 3-fold  relative to ye and may contribute as well to the hydrolysis of the glucooligosaccharides derived from this polymer.

genes involved in starch utilization
pjdr <dig> grows very efficiently on starch  <cit> . utilization of this α- <dig> -linked glucose storage polysaccharide appears similar to barley β-glucan as this polysaccharide is also chemically simple relative to xylans with fewer enzymes required for degradation to glucose. the genome of pjdr <dig> encodes four gh <dig> amylases. three of these, amy13a <dig>  amy13a <dig>  and amy13a <dig> have significantly increased transcript levels ranging from 55-fold to over 100-fold increased expression during growth on starch . both amy13a <dig>  and amy13a <dig>  are predicted to be secreted and primarily responsible for endo-hydrolysis of native starch. the amy13a <dig> gene encodes a large multimodular enzyme including slh domains and cbm’s for cell surface proximal substrate localization  while amy13a <dig> encodes only a catalytic domain. the starch utilization system in pjdr <dig> also has a predicted intracellular amylase, amy13a <dig>  presumably to complete the degradation of the transported, intracellular maltodextrins.

amy13a <dig> shares 46 % amino acid sequence identity with the extracellular amylase from bacillus megaterium    <cit>  and amy13a <dig> shares 33 % identity over a large portion of its modular sequence with an amylopullanase from thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus   <cit> . amy13a <dig> shares 47 % amino acid identity with an intracellular maltogenic amylase from b. subtilis   <cit>  where it is thought to function in the conversion of maltotriose and larger maltodextrins to maltose and glucose .

a single abc transporter gene cassette showed increased transcript levels during growth on starch relative to ye . the genes for this transporter  are just upstream of amy13a <dig>  and form a predicted operon . the solute binding protein  of this transporter shares 33 % amino acid identity with a maltodextrin binding protein from bacillus subtilis  <dig>   <cit> . this putative maltose/maltodextrin abc transporter gene cassette was shown to be markedly up-regulated during growth on xylans   <cit> . however, the genomic localization of this abc gene cluster within a predicted operon containing the gene encoding extracellular amylase suggests its primary function is that of a maltodextrin transporter . this overlap in regulation will be further discussed below.

the high amino acid sequence identity between amy13a <dig> and the maltogenic amylase from b. subtilis suggest that this enzyme might process transported maltodextrins to glucose and maltose  <cit> . as a component of a complete starch utilization system, gene  <dig> encodes a putative α-glucan phosphorylase  allowing for phosphorolytic cleavage of intracellular maltose  <cit> . expression levels of this gene on starch compared to ye yielded insignificant results , but a  <dig> -fold transcript increase is observed relative to growth on glucose  . transcript data for the fourth predicted amylase encoding gene,  <dig>  was not considered statistically significant  and did not appear to exhibit dynamic regulation on starch, barley β-glucan or xylan and linear rpkm values were comparatively low .

genes with increased expression during growth on maltose
as the primary hydrolysis limit product of starch, maltose was included in this study to distinguish physiological features for efficient starch utilization. the transporter genes described above as part of the putative starch utilization operon are also upregulated. in addition, genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encoding a second abc transporter are up-regulated approximately 10-fold on maltose over ye . once internalized, maltose would be expected to follow the pathway similar to that predicted in starch utilization; however, for this growth condition expression of the gene encoding the malp protein is not increased relative to any other growth condition.

this finding reveals a difference between the intracellular processing of maltodextrins derived from starch hydrolysis by the surface localized multimodular amy13a <dig> and maltose directly assimilated. a focused search failed to identify homologs of genes known for the conversion of maltose or maltose-6-phosphase . two other genes upstream of those encoding the maltose specific transporter identified above code for proteins annotated as an oxidoreductase  and a hypothetical protein  and the predicted operon appears related to the thuab encoding operon involved in trehalose utilization in agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit>  . this suggests that pjdr <dig> converts maltose to 3-keto-maltose.

monosaccharide assimilation and metabolism
from genome analysis  <cit> , intracellular metabolism of the hexose, glucose, and the pentoses, xylose and arabinose, are expected to follow through the embden-meyerhof-parnas  pathway and pentose phosphate pathway , respectively, for entrance into the tricarboxylic acid  cycle. following transport of arabinose through the previously identified arabinose responsive abc transporter  <cit> , this sugar may be converted to ribulose-5-phosphate by the arabinose isomerase and ribulose kinase enzymes. in pjdr <dig>  the gene  <dig>  attains a 24-fold increase in transcript level with growth on arabinose and  <dig> -fold on sorghum megaxn . based on transcript levels the candidate ribulose kinase enzyme is encoded by gene  <dig>  this enzyme is a distant homolog  to the arab protein which is a component of the l-arabinan utilization system of geobacillus stearothermophilus  <cit>  . transcript levels of gene  <dig> are increased 17-fold on arabinose  and 3-fold on sorghum megaxn relative to ye . this gene does not show an increased transcript level on other carbohydrate growth conditions used in this study. the genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encoding an abc transporter are primarily responsive to xylose resulting in an average of 135-fold increase in transcript level relative to ye . these genes also showed significant but much lower fold increases on glucose and arabinose. additionally, a predicted symporter encoded by gene  <dig> shares 49 % identity with the arae xylose and arabinose symporter in b. subtilis   <cit> . expression of this gene is responsive to xylose resulting in a 162-fold increase. this gene is also expressed on cellobiose , glucose and arabinose although to a much lower extent than observed on xylose . conversion of xylose to xylulose-5-phosphate follows a similar path as arabinose since genes encoding xylose isomerase  and xylulose kinase  result in nearly a 100-fold and 63-fold increase in expression, respectively, on xylose compared to ye controls . growth on xylans also resulted in transcript increases of 35-fold and greater for these two genes .table  <dig> regulation of genes involved in monosaccharide transport and introduction into metabolic pathways

while the genes that encode the transporters that import xylose and arabinose can be identified based on homology and increased transcript levels, a system for efficient glucose assimilation is less apparent. genes encoding three putative abc transporters showed increased transcript levels with growth on glucose, but for only two of these abc transporters  is it possible that glucose may be the target sugar for transport. for both of these transporter gene sets transcript is increased not only on glucose, but also similarly increased on arabinose, xylose and cellobiose . the 0472– <dig> gene set is increased more significantly at approximately 20-fold relative to the ye control, while the 2400– <dig> gene set is just greater than the significance cutoff of 4-fold . the third abc transporter gene set whose transcript is significantly increased with growth on glucose  is assigned as a xylose transporter. while its expression is significant with growth on glucose, it is very low relative to growth on xylose.

analysis for phosphotransferase systems  reveals two operons  encoding all protein components of a complete pts system. based on homology, the 6221– <dig> gene set appears very likely to be a mannitol transport system, while the 2007– <dig> set encodes a eiia component  which is annotated as a glucose superfamily transporter, and a separate protein product  encoding the eiibc components annotated as an n-acetylglucosamine specific transporter . none of the genes encoding the complete pts system components have increased transcript responsive to growth on glucose relative to ye. interestingly, two unlinked pts system components  have relatively high constitutive expression levels, but their roles are unclear . the analysis for potential glucose specific transporters is not conclusive from this data. once transported into the cell, conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate for entry into glycolysis appears to be mediated by only a single enzyme: a glucokinase  which yields an average rpkm value of 128 ±  <dig> over all the tested growth conditions . this physiological data underscores original research which showed that pjdr <dig> does not efficiently utilize simple sugars in minimal salt media  <cit> .

overlapping regulation: starch > xylan > soluble β-glucan
unexpectedly, the combined data for barley β-glucan, starch and xylan reveals a regulatory connection for utilization of these polymers. this can be seen in quantitative comparisons of the expression of genes encoding the secreted multimodular gh <dig>  gh <dig>  and gh <dig> endolytic enzymes and those encoding their associated substrate binding proteins that serve as a representative of the specific abc transporter for the saccharides generated by these enzymes on the cell surface . growth on xylans, both gxn and gaxn, supports the enhanced expression of genes associated with utilization of xylans and starch but not those associated with the utilization of soluble β-glucan. while barley β-glucan induces genes related to its extracellular degradation and assimilation, these results show that it also induces  <dig> of the  <dig> glycoside hydrolase genes involved in xylan utilization   <cit> . furthermore, while growth on xylan does not induce any soluble β-glucan utilization genes it does induce genes encoding all of the gh <dig> α-amylases and the abc transporter considered to be involved in starch depolymerization and transport for utilization   <cit>  with the exception of the putative α-glucan phosphorylase gene, malp. following growth on starch, pjdr <dig> does not induce genes for either xylan or barley β-glucan utilization. these relationships are represented in the heat map shown in fig. 3b in which expression of genes encoding abc transporter proteins as well as accessory enzymes for intracellular metabolism of assimilated oligosaccharides are shown. these findings may be due to a metabolic substrate preference in a manner similar to glucose mediated catabolite repression, or result from evolved enzyme systems for utilization of polysaccharides that are typically associated. in cereal grains, these three carbohydrates can be found together, with xylan and β-glucan localized more to the cell wall and outer layers, and the starch consolidated in the endoplasm  <cit> . the model that currently describes this relationship  can be described as starch first, xylan second and barley β-glucan third. from the observed coordinate gene expression, pjdr <dig> appears prepared to utilize multiple polysaccharides .fig.  <dig> comparison of gene expression of surface localized substrate specific glycoside hydrolases and their regulon associated solute binding protein. rpkm  values from transcriptomic studies following pjdr <dig> growth on sweetgum gxn , sorghum gaxn , barley β-glucan  or starch  for the genes encoding the large multimodular surface anchored glycoside hydrolase and abc transporter solute binding protein  which represents regulation for each of the three polysaccharides. a culture containing only  <dig>  % yeast extract without carbohydrate  served as control for comparison. locus tag annotated as pjdr2_#### abbreviated to only consist of the numeric portion, ####

in consideration of the expression of the genes encoding intracellular xylanases, e.g. xyn43b <dig> and xyn <dig>  <cit>  on barley β-glucan, it is possible that these enzymes may have a bifunctional role in the intracellular hydrolysis of β-glucooligosaccharides, thereby, providing an additional route for the intracellular processing of the barley β-glucan derived glucooligosaccharides and cellobiose.

other genes involved in transport also show overlapping regulation. the predicted abc transporter previously annotated as a “multiple sugar transport system” consisting of the genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> is shown to have increased expression on barley β-glucan  similar to that observed for xylan  <cit> . this is the only abc transporter gene set that follows the pattern of expression during growth on barley β-glucan as that observed for the xylan specific glycoside hydrolase genes , supporting the possibility that it might be bifunctional in substrate recognition. one other gene encoding an abc transporter component also follows this pattern. gene  <dig>  encoding an inner membrane component, ugpe , of the aldouronate utilization gene cluster  <cit>  has a markedly increased transcript level  on barley β-glucan. studies are underway to elucidate these overlapping regulatory connections.

some genes with increased transcript levels during growth on cellobiose were found to also have increased expression levels with growth on xylans. the gene cluster  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  encodes an abc transporter annotated as an “unknown carbohydrate transporter” and has been assigned a potential role in xylan utilization based on increased transcript levels   <cit> . analysis of growth on cellobiose indicates these genes are expressed at a level comparable to that on xylan. a corollary to this finding is the observation that growth on cellobiose also resulted in increased transcript levels for genes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encoding an abc transporter previously assigned a putative function in xylooligosaccharide  transport  <cit> . from the similar level of expression on both xylan and cellobiose, it is proposed that these transporters may be specific for disaccharides such as cellobiose and the primary neutral product of enzymatic xylan hydrolysis, xylobiose. these findings indicate that the transporters of β-configured oligosaccharides may be promiscuous in their substrate recognition.

proteins with slh domains
enzyme systems utilized by pjdr <dig> for the extracellular processing of xylan, barley β-glucan and starch share a common theme. these systems include extracellular cell-associated multimodular glycoside hydrolases to generate oligosaccharides that are released in close proximity to the bacterial cell wall. this functionality is mediated by surface layer homology  domains that anchor the enzymes to the cell surface  <cit>  and carbohydrate binding modules  that presumably associate the enzyme with the target polysaccharide  <cit> . these cell-surface proximal oligosaccharides are then efficiently transported with substrate specific abc transporters and further hydrolyzed within the cell to monosaccharides for introduction into catabolism. this surface localization represents a strategy for competitive utilization of these polysaccharides. as part of this work we sought to define the roles of slh domains in pjdr <dig> in the processing of plant polysaccharides.

in total, there are  <dig> genes encoding proteins with regions homologous with slh domains. of these,  <dig> have two or more consecutive slh domains which is the minimum set thought to be required for tight binding to the cell wall  <cit> . of the  <dig> slh domain containing proteins,  <dig> are predicted to be involved in carbohydrate processing  as indicated through domain analysis. in this smaller set, the average calculated protein size is nearly 193 kda and the average predicted pi is  <dig>  with a standard deviation of just  <dig> . domain and blastp analysis  shows the diversity of functions of associated carbohydrate active enzymes among these slh proteins . in the current transcriptomic data set, only a single slh-bearing gene has been identified being involved in the catalysis of either xylan , barley β-glucan  or starch  utilization from the  <dig> identified slh-encoding carbohydrate processing genes . of the other slh domain containing proteins in this list it can be seen that pjdr <dig> may utilize numerous other polysaccharides with the same strategy. some of these include arabinan, galactomannan, chitin, pectin and hyaluronan .table  <dig> list of surface layer homology domain containing proteins of pjdr <dig> proposed to be involved in extracellular polysaccharide processing

polysaccharide utilization in pjdr2
from the studies presented here for the utilization of barley-derived β-glucan and starch, we observe a similar strategy evolved by pjdr <dig> as illustrated in the earlier xylan transcriptome report  <cit> . in each case coordinately expressed gene sets have been identified  and central to each encoded enzyme system is a multimodular glycoside hydrolase containing carbohydrate binding modules which afford interaction with polysaccharide substrates and a triplicate set of slh domains for cell surface localized formation of oligosaccharides .

for processing of β- <dig> -glucans, contiguous genes encoding transcriptional regulators, abc transporters, the multimodular cell-associated bgl16a <dig> and the secreted non-modular bgl16a <dig> catalytic domain along with an associated abc transporter comprise a β-glucan utilization regulon. in this case both secreted enzymes digest barley β-glucan to tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexasaccharides, and laminarin to mono-, di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides indicating similar functions for both enzymes  <cit> . these oligosaccharides resulting from extracellular barley β-glucan hydrolysis and cellobiose  are presumably transported into the cell where they are subsequently degraded to monosaccharides by the action of a gh <dig> endoglucanase and/or a novel gh <dig> enzyme  with β-glucosidase functionality.

for starch processing, a regulon encoding a putative maltodextrin abc transporter together with the non-modular amy13a <dig> managed starch utilization. encoded distally, the multimodular cell-associated amylase amy13a <dig> likely produces small maltodextrins proximal to the cell surface. these may then be taken up and processed by intracellular maltogenic amy13a <dig> to yield maltose and glucose. final conversion of maltose is thought to occur through the action of an α-glucan phosphorylase yielding glucose and glucose- <dig> phosphate.

for the soluble β-glucan, starch and xylan utilization systems, two endo-acting hydrolases may work synergistically with each other for efficient depolymerization of the specific polymeric substrate to oligosaccharides. the modular property of the larger enzyme allows generation of oligosaccharides close to the cell surface without diffusion into the medium and hence couples the depolymerization process with assimilation by abc transporters for intracellular processing and metabolism. these systems for polysaccharide utilization with minimized secretion of extracellular glycoside hydrolases coupled to transport of oligosaccharides in lieu of simple monomeric sugars potentially affords a significant conservation of cellular energy in the form of atp as described for the processing of cellulose by c. thermocellum.

based on increased expression levels of genes during growth on multiple polysaccharides a regulatory connection is observed between utilization of barley β-glucan, starch and xylans. barley β-glucan induces genes involved in extracellular depolymerization and assimilation specific to soluble β- <dig> -glucan. however, it also induces many of the genes shown to play a prominent role in the xylan utilization systems  <cit> . although xylans do not induce genes specific to barley β-glucan utilization, they do induce genes belonging to the starch utilization system. when pjdr <dig> was grown on starch, no genes specific to xylan or barley β-glucan utilization were found to be induced. these studies show the transcriptional induction and repression strategies evolved in pjdr <dig> for utilizing a variety of polysaccharides.

interestingly, induction of the starch utilization genes with growth on xylan results in increased expression of amy13a <dig> and amy13a <dig> while the amy13a <dig> gene encoding the large surface anchored amylase is expressed just enough to meet the significance selection cutoff . this same pattern is also observed with growth on maltose. it appears the elevated expression of the amy13a <dig> gene is specific for starch and the non-starch substrates which activate the expression of the starch utilization regulon  may poise pjdr <dig> for rapid response to starch availability.

slh domains appear to play a vital role in interaction of pjdr <dig> with its native environment. the  <dig> slh domain-containing proteins encoded in the genome of pjdr <dig> highlight the expanded use of this domain for cell wall associations and also hints to a modus operandi, at least regarding an approach to polymeric substrate utilization.

CONCLUSIONS
the genome of pjdr <dig> comprises genes encoding extracellular cell-associated depolymerizing enzymes to bioprocess various plant polysaccharides and these include xylans, soluble β-glucans, starch, and also arabinans and galactomannans . the polysaccharide utilization systems in pjdr <dig> serve as potential candidates for further evaluation or for introduction into other related fermentative bacteria to serve as biocatalysts to achieve direct conversion of non-cellulosic biomass to desired products. preliminary studies have shown the ability of pjdr <dig> to produce fermentative products including lactate, acetate, and ethanol from xylans, β- <dig> -glucans, and starch, under oxygen limiting conditions . the potential of pjdr <dig> to produce individual cell-associated glycoside hydrolases for processing non-cellulosic polysaccharides is an alternative strategy to the cell-associated cellulosome complexes evolved by cellulolytic clostridium  <cit> . pjdr <dig> may be considered for direct bioprocessing of hemicelluloses or may be co-cultured with cellulolytic organisms tolerant of microaerophilic conditions for conversion of biomass to targeted products. pjdr <dig> is a candidate for further development as a biocatalyst for consolidated bioprocessing of biomass derived from energy crops and agricultural residues to targeted biofuels and chemicals.
