BACKGROUND
in the plant zygotic embryo, during orthodox seed maturation, different gene expression programs activate mechanisms that prevent and repair severe desiccation damage, at the same time allowing prolonged survival of the dry mature seed . only the resurrection plants display similar levels of  stress tolerance well beyond germination  <cit> . interestingly, similar gene expression programs appear to be activated both in seeds and in vegetative organs of resurrection plants  <cit> . in sunflower, one of these genetic programs, which has been extensively studied in our lab, is under transcriptional control by heat shock factors ; these hsfs include the seed-specific hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . hahsfa <dig> enhanced seed longevity in transgenic tobacco  <cit> , when overexpressed from ds <dig> sequences . we have also shown that the ectopic overexpression of hahsfa <dig> from cauliflower mosaic virus  35s sequences in tobacco seedlings conferred dramatic resistance of green organs and of whole seedlings to severe dehydration  <cit> . the tolerated dehydration was quantified as water loss of up to 98% of total water content. in addition, whole 35s:a <dig> seedlings resisted drastic oxidative stress conditions, as treatments in the dark with  <dig> mm h2o <dig> for  <dig> h  <cit> . the photosynthetic apparatus of the 35s:a <dig> seedlings, as well as other cellular membranes, resisted such stress conditions  <cit> . in all these instances, hahsfa <dig> overexpression activated genes that encode shsps from different classes. this resulted in the accumulation of cytosolic  and plastidial  shsp forms. most of the hahsfa9-induced shsps are expressed mainly  during zygotic embryogenesis in seeds.

precedent work in our lab indicated the existence of additional hsfs necessary for the activation of the hsfa <dig> program. thus, stabilized forms of the auxin/indole acetic acid  protein haiaa <dig>  <cit>  or dominant-negative forms of hahsfa <dig>  but not inactive forms of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> , both caused reduction of seed longevity and loss of function of the hahsfa <dig> program in tobacco seeds. we inferred that haiaa <dig> would repress not only hahsfa <dig>  but also the additional hsfs that were first indicated by our results of loss of function using dominant-negative forms of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . the actual number of these additional hsfs is still unknown, but recently published results from our lab strongly indicated that hahsfa4a is one of such hsfs  <cit> . hahsfa4a showed in planta nuclear interaction with hahsfa9; a synergistic transcriptional activation was observed on sunflower seed shsp promoters, as hahsp <dig>  g <dig>  when hahsfa4a was assayed together with hahsfa9; and, finally, the interaction of both hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a with haiaa <dig> lead to passive repression of the synergism between hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a  <cit> . based in these results, we have proposed that hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> might synergistically co-activate the same genetic program of seed longevity and desiccation tolerance in sunflower  <cit> . this program, referred to as the hsfa <dig> program, was functionally redundant with rest of programs that determine desiccation tolerance in seeds, programs that are inactive in vegetative organs  <cit> .

plant hsfs belong to different multigenic families . hsfs from these families, classes a, b, and c, differ among them and from other animal hsfs in short conserved sequences , and in structural features as the length and organization of the oligomerization domain  and flexible linker sequences of variable length  that connect the od with the dna-binding domain. the od of class a hsfs has a characteristic insertion of  <dig> amino acid residues that extend the od. this extended od allows homo- and hetero-multimerization between class a hsfs  <cit> . the a <dig> hsfs  are characterized -among other properties- by the presence of conserved signature sequences  located immediately after the dna-binding domain .

overexpression of transcription factors has some advantages; thus, it is less affected by the functional redundancy that exists within multigenic families  <cit> . furthermore, there are precedents where the co-overexpression of two transcription factors could reveal a synergistic enhancement of the phenotypes caused by one of the factors in separate . some plant hsfs have been characterized by overexpression. the reported hsf overexpression studies using transgenic plants mostly involve single, class a, hsfs from a brief list of species that, besides sunflower, it includes arabidopsis, lily, rice, tomato and wheat . we do not know of precedent studies that involve the conjoint overexpression of multiple hsfs.

functional studies of plant hsfa <dig> are very scarce. there is only some evidence for hsfa <dig> functions related to moderate stress responses  <cit> , as well as a single hsfa <dig> overexpression study that we know of  <cit> . the later study has showed in transgenic rice plants that a hsfa <dig> from rice , or from wheat , can confer cd tolerance. thus, the available studies for plant hsfa <dig> function have indicated their functional specialization.

in this work, we analyze the function of hahsfa4a in transgenic tobacco. tobacco is a plant closely related to sunflower, and we have showed that in tobacco transcriptional regulation of the hsfa <dig> program is conserved . we overexpress hahsfa4a alone, and in combination with hahsfa <dig>  we should emphasize that seeds or seedlings from the different non-transgenic , single-transgenic, and double-transgenic lines, were subjected to the same, stress or seed deterioration conditions, in each case. we also point out that as in our previous studies  <cit> , a molecular characterization of hsp accumulation was performed with seeds and seedlings grown under control  conditions, the same for all lines compared. we thus tried further exploring the correlation of the observed stress protection with the hsps that are present before the stress treatments. seeds that combine the ds10-driven overexpression of hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> resisted accelerated aging better than seeds that overexpress hahsfa <dig> only. the single, ds10-driven, overexpression of hahsfa4a enhanced seed longevity. however, the 35s-driven overexpression of hahsfa4a alone did not induce any sort of abiotic stress tolerance in vegetative organs of seedlings. in contrast, the 35s-driven overexpression of both hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> caused further tolerance of seedlings to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress conditions, as compared to the effect of hahsfa <dig> alone. the enhanced stress tolerance occurred in coincidence with only subtle changes in the accumulation of small heat shock proteins . these results demonstrate in planta functional effects of hahsfa4a on seed longevity and on tolerance to severe abiotic stress conditions. these effects, which are unmatched for a plant hsfa <dig>  required hahsfa <dig> .

RESULTS
enhanced seed longevity in plants that conjointly overexpress hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a
we have obtained lines that combine seed-specific overexpression of hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a: the ds10:a9/a4a lines. we analyzed seven different sibling pairs of ds10:a <dig>  and ds10:a9/a4a  lines. we investigated whether the overexpression of hahsfa4a in the ds10:a9/a4a lines enhances resistance to accelerated aging, a measure of seed longevity. we performed accelerated aging procedures similar to that used in our earlier studies, except that the aging temperature was increased from 50°c to 52°c. this was required to substantially age the ds10:a <dig> seeds, as with the 50°c treatments only sibling non-transgenic seeds were substantially affected  <cit> . the results of the experiments summarized in figure  <dig>  clearly show a statistically significant increase of the resistance to accelerated aging of the ds10:a9/a4a lines compared to the sibling ds10:a <dig> lines . we thus demonstrated in transgenic plants that the combined overexpression of hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> enhanced seed-longevity beyond what observed for hahsfa <dig> in separate.

we also compared accelerated aging of single-homozygous ds10:a4a seeds with sibling nt seed. these aging treatments were also performed at 52°c, which allowed additional comparison with the experiments performed with the sibling ds10:a <dig> and ds10:a9/a4a lines . the results of these experiments  show that when only hahsfa4a is overexpressed, this hsf enhances seed longevity. the comparison of data in figure  <dig> with the results in additional file  <dig> showed that seeds resisted the 52°c aging treatment in a similar way in the single-homozygous ds10:a4a lines as in the double-homozygous ds10:a9/a4a lines.

in the ds10:a4a seeds, hahsfa4a overexpression enhanced hsp accumulation. 1d-western blots showed clear effects on hsp <dig> and shsp cii accumulation, and lesser effects on the shsp ci. 2d-western-blots confirmed this and the specific augmented accumulation of some shsp forms . in the ds10:a9/a4a seeds a specific enhancement of hsp accumulation, respect to the sibling ds10:a <dig> lines, also occurred. in 1d-western blots, this enhancement was detected only for hsp <dig>  the enhancement of specific shsp-cii accumulation was observed only in 2d-western blots . we would like to point out that, as explained with detail in the methods section, we performed careful controls to insure equal loading of total protein in all the 1d and 2d-western analyses included in this report.

the single overexpression of hahsfa4a does not induce stress tolerance in vegetative organs
we analyzed the effect of the single overexpression of hahsfa4a, on seedling stress tolerance, using the 35s:a4a lines. in these studies, three different, homozygous transgenic/non-transgenic  sibling line pairs were used: 35s:a4a <dig>  nt1; 35s:a4a <dig>  nt2; and 35s:a4a <dig>  nt <dig>  we first analyzed tolerance to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress conditions. the single overexpression of hahsfa4a, in the 35s:a4a seedlings, failed to induce tolerance to the severe dehydration and the drastic oxidative stress conditions that withstand the 35s:a <dig> seedlings ; protection of the photosystem ii  was not observed in the 35s:a4a seedlings . we also determined if the overexpressed hahsfa4a affects the basal-, or the acquired-thermotolerance of the 35s:a4a seedlings. we used experimental conditions as previously reported for similar studies of the effects of hahsfa <dig>  <cit> . non-transgenic tobacco seedlings do not withstand lethal heat stress treatments for  <dig>  h at 48°c. the 35s:a4a seedlings also did not resist the same 48°c treatment . this result contrasts with what found for the 35s:a <dig> seedlings, where basal thermotolerance was enhanced and survival after a similar 48°c treatment was observed  <cit> . the nt seedlings acquired thermotolerance, and resisted the 48°c treatment, only after a heat-acclimation treatment for three hours at the non-lethal temperature of 40°c . the 35s:a4a seedlings also acquired thermotolerance and subsequently resisted the 48°c treatment in a similar way as the sibling nt seedlings . hsp accumulation, including that of hsp <dig> and of different shsps  was not detected at normal growth temperatures in the 35s:a4a seedlings; these proteins however were detected at normal levels in the heat acclimated transgenic and sibling nt seedlings .

enhanced tolerance to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress in plants that conjointly overexpress hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a
we determined whether the combined overexpression of hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a in transgenic tobacco enhances the stress tolerance observed upon the single overexpression of hahsfa <dig> <cit> . the previously reported stress tolerance was unusually high; however there was room for further improvement. for example, the aerial part of transgenic tobacco seedlings survived dehydration better than roots  <cit> . this limited survival of whole seedlings after a water loss of ≈ 98% of the total initial water content. the analyses summarized in figure  <dig> where performed with four sibling pairs of single-homozygous  and double-homozygous  lines. the combined overexpression of hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a in the 35s:a9/a4a lines substantially enhanced survival of whole seedlings after either stress treatment: severe dehydration , or treatments with  <dig> mm h2o <dig> . in both cases, survival of whole-35s:a9/a4a seedlings more than doubled that of 35s:a <dig> siblings. these differences were statistically highly significant . the, surviving, whole-35s:a9/a4a seedlings represented slightly above 12% of the initial amount of seedlings. however, in most seedlings only some leaves resisted the stress treatments. survival after dehydration of one to four leaves per seedling  was also significantly higher for the 35s:a9/a4a lines compared to the 35s:a <dig> lines . after the  <dig> mm h2o <dig> stress treatments, only up to two true leaves per seedling survived, such survival  was also higher for the 35s:a9/a4a lines compared to the 35s:a <dig> lines . figure 4c shows pictures with a representative example of the results summarized in figure 4b.

enhanced protection of the psii, as evaluated with fv/fm values in the 35s:a9/a4a lines compared with sibling 35s:a <dig> lines, was also observed , but only after the  <dig> mm h2o <dig> stress treatments . after, standard,  <dig> mm h2o <dig> treatments  <cit> , there was not difference between the fv/fm of these lines . the additional protection of the psii conferred by the combination of hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a is thus observed only under very drastic, oxidative stress, conditions. the 35s:a9/a4a seedlings also showed lower electrolyte leakage under normal grown conditions, when compared to 35s:a <dig> siblings . this supports the enhancement of protection of other cellular membranes  in the 35s:a9/a4a seedlings. we conclude that the overexpression of hahsfa4a, in combination with that hahsfa <dig>  further enhanced the, already unusually high, stress resistance conferred by the single overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  furthermore, the functional effects of hahsfa4a in vegetative organs required hahsfa <dig>  we could show that the tagged hahsfa4a protein was detected even at slightly higher level in the 35s:a4a than in the 35s:a9/a4a seedlings . thus, a functional interaction-specificity for hsfs as hahsfa <dig>  rather than the expression level of hahsfa4a would explain the lack of effects of hahsfa4a when singly overexpressed in seedlings.

the combined overexpression of hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a in the 35s:a9/a4a seedlings, resulted only in a slight enhancement of specific hsp-accumulation at normal growth temperatures. this was observed upon very careful comparison with sibling 35s:a <dig> material. among the analyzed hsps  only some cytosolic shsps  were affected; furthermore, this slight accumulation enhancement was detected using 2d gels, but not with 1d-gels . we think that it is unlikely that the observed enhancement of vegetative stress tolerance was caused by these shsps; these results would rather point to alternative or complementary effects of, still unknown,  genes coactivated by hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a.

discussion
to date, synergistic interactions of plant hsfs that enhance transcriptional activation have been analyzed only by transient expression  <cit> . we note that, except for our precedent study  <cit> , these interactions involve “vegetative hsfs” . the interactions between “vegetative hsfs” would be thus relevant mostly for heat-, and other moderate stress responses in organs other than seeds. as far as we know, our work represents the first report addressing the effects of combined overexpression of hsfs in transgenic plants. we could thus show that, in vegetative organs of seedlings, hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a showed synergistic functional effects on tolerance to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress . these results would functionally confirm that at least two hsfs, hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a, co-activate the same program of seed longevity and desiccation tolerance in sunflower.

there is a single report  <cit>  that describes the effect of overexpression of hsfa <dig> from wheat  and rice . the overexpression of tahsfa4a in rice plants conferred cd tolerance. unpublished observations cited in the same report suggest that tahsfa4a is not involved in thermotolerance  <cit> . in addition, tahsfa4a and oshsfa4a, but not a similar monocot hsfa <dig>  oshsfa4d, conferred cd tolerance in yeast  <cit> . loss of function analyses of arabidopsis athsfa4c and rice oshsfa4d has indicated additional hsfa <dig> functions. these functions include the sensing of moderate oxidative stress and gravitropism, thus being also unrelated to the conventional heat stress response and to thermotolerance  <cit> . the work reported here for hahsfa4a includes the first described effects of overexpression of a dicot hsfa <dig>  hahsfa4a, as tahsfa4a  <cit> , does not seem to be involved in canonical heat responses or in thermotolerance. however, the functional effects of hahsfa4a seem to be quite different from what was known for similar hsfa <dig>  hahsfa4a would be specifically involved in seed functions related to longevity and in tolerance to severe dehydration.

the observed functional effects of hahsfa4a appear to require at least hahsfa <dig> and/or other seed-specific hsfs that are not present in vegetative organs, either in unstressed or heat-stressed conditions. this functional requirement would set apart hahsfa4a from the rest of plant, class a, activator hsfs analyzed to date. the overexpression of hahsfa4a in vegetative organs of seedlings potentiated phenotypes that we previously described for the overexpression of hahsfa <dig>  but only when hahsfa <dig> was conjointly overexpressed. hahsfa4a overexpression also enhanced seed longevity, which is a hahsfa <dig> overexpression phenotype that we also have confirmed by loss of function  <cit> . these results agree with a hypermorphic effect of hahsfa4a on hahsfa <dig>  which would safely support the suggested novel functions for hahsfa4a. because of the normal phenotype of the 35s:a4a plants, the potentiated phenotypes of the 35s:a9/a4a plants are explained as a synergistic enhancement of the effects of hahsfa <dig>  in tobacco seeds, where an endogenous hsfa <dig> is expressed  <cit> , the single overexpression of hahsfa4a enhanced seed-longevity and hsp accumulation . hahsfa4a also augmented seed longevity when overexpressed together with hahsfa <dig> . however, this effect was similar to what observed in the single transgenic ds10:a4a lines , and thus appears to be largely dependent on endogenous hsfs  and not of the overexpressed hahsfa <dig>  the levels of the endogenous hsfa <dig> protein would be high and thus sufficient to account for the observed hahsfa4a effect. indeed, and consistently with this interpretation, the hahsfa <dig> protein appears to be quite abundant in sunflower seed embryos  <cit> . in contrast, in seedlings in absence of the endogenous hsfa <dig> protein, the single overexpression of hahsfa4a did not enhance thermotolerance; neither it induced accumulation, at normal growth temperatures, of hsps as shsp-ci, -cii, -p, and hsp <dig> . these results indicate that hahsfa4a failed to functionally interact with the tobacco hsfs that are involved in vegetative thermotolerance; this would include the constitutive hsfs present in seedlings, and the hsfs induced by the heat-acclimation treatment used in figure  <dig>  this inference from the results in figure  <dig> would agree with the specificity that hahsfa4a showed in its synergistic interaction with hahsfa <dig>  but not with lphsfa <dig>  in transient assays  <cit> . the lack of effect of hahsfa4a, on hsp accumulation and thermotolerance, contrasts with what observed upon the single overexpression of other class a hsfs; this includes, for example, hsfa1b , hsfa <dig>  hsfa <dig>  and hsfa <dig> of arabidopsis and other plants  <cit> . in seedlings, the enhancement of dehydration and oxidative stress tolerance by hahsfa4a was strictly dependent on the conjoint overexpression of hahsfa <dig> . our results agree with reported transient expression analyses using shsp-ci promoters in sunflower. these analyses showed that hahsfa4a had very little  transcriptional activity by itself  <cit> . in contrast, hahsfa4a assayed together with hahsfa <dig> showed a strong synergistic transcriptional effect; furthermore, hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig> physically interact with each other  <cit> . therefore, these two hsfs might cause in transgenic plants the observed functional effects as hetero-oligomers. our results do not exclude the involvement in the same genetic program of additional hsfs besides hsfa <dig> and hsfa4a in tobacco, sunflower and related plants. however, if additional hsfs able to functionally interact with hahsfa4a exist in tobacco, these hsfs would be, as hsfa <dig>  preferentially  expressed in seeds.

CONCLUSIONS
our work demonstrated a novel involvement of hahsfa4a in seed longevity and severe stress tolerance, as well as the strict dependency on hahsfa <dig>  of the functional effects of hahsfa4a. these findings contribute to the very scarce previous knowledge on plant type a <dig> hsf  function. the single overexpression of hahsfa4a did not alter vegetative stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco. in contrast, hahsfa4a enhanced seed longevity. furthermore, in vegetative organs of seedlings hahsfa <dig> and hahsfa4a showed synergistic functional effects on tolerance to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress. we thus showed potentially useful effects when hahsfa4a and hahsfa <dig>  are combined. our results might open new ways to engineering seed longevity and tolerance of plants to severe dehydration and to drastic oxidative stress conditions.
