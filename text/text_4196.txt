BACKGROUND
moraxella catarrhalis, formerly known as both neisseria catarrhalis and branhamella catarrhalis  <cit> , is a gram-negative bacterium that can frequently be isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy persons  <cit> . for many years, m. catarrhalis was considered to be a harmless commensal  <cit> . about twenty years ago, it was acknowledged that m. catarrhalis was a pathogen of the respiratory tract  <cit> , and since then much evidence has accumulated which indicates that m. catarrhalis causes disease in both adults and children. m. catarrhalis is one of the three most important causes of otitis media in infants and very young children  <cit> . in adults, this bacterium can cause infectious exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and one recent study estimates that, in the united states alone, m. catarrhalis may cause  <dig> million- <dig> million infectious exacerbations of copd annually  <cit> .

the ability of m. catarrhalis to colonize the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract  is undoubtedly linked to its expression of different adhesins for various human cells and antigens  <cit> . in addition, this bacterium clearly has the metabolic capability to survive and grow in this environment in the presence of the normal flora. a recent study  <cit>  identified a number of different metabolic pathways encoded by the m. catarrhalis atcc  <dig> genome which could be involved in the colonization process. it is likely that m. catarrhalis forms a biofilm in concert with these other bacteria in the nasopharynx  <cit> , although only a few m. catarrhalis gene products relevant to biofilm formation have been identified to date  <cit> . similarly, there is little known about what extracellular gene products are synthesized by m. catarrhalis and released into the extracellular milieu. a study from campagnari and colleagues  <cit>  found that one or two very large proteins with some similarity to the filamentous hemagglutinin  of bordetella pertussis could be found in m. catarrhalis culture supernatant fluid. using the nucleotide sequence of the genome of m. catarrhalis atcc  <dig>  murphy and co-workers  <cit>  identified a large number  of proteins that had signal sequences, among which may be proteins that are released from the m. catarrhalis cell. another group showed that m. catarrhalis culture supernatant fluid contained several different proteins as detected by sds-page analysis, but the identity of the individual proteins was not determined  <cit> .

in the present study, we report the first identification of a bacteriocin that is produced by m. catarrhalis. bacteriocins are proteins or peptides secreted or released by some bacteria that can effect both intraspecies and interspecies killing, and are responsible for some types of bacterial antagonism . the locus encoding this peptide bacteriocin was identified initially in a m. catarrhalis plasmid and subsequently shown to be present in the chromosome of some m. catarrhalis strains. four genes encoding the bacteriocin, relevant secretion factors, and a host immunity factor were shown to form a polycistronic operon . this bacteriocin was shown to be active against m. catarrhalis strains lacking this operon. recombinant methods were used to confirm the identity of the cognate immunity factor which does not resemble other proteins in the databases. in competitive co-culture assays, a m. catarrhalis strain expressing this bacteriocin became the predominant member of a mixed culture in which the other strain lacked the mcbabci locus.

RESULTS
m. catarrhalis strain e <dig> produces a factor that inhibits the growth of m. catarrhalis strain o35e
wild-type m. catarrhalis strain e <dig> was originally described as the host for the plasmid plq <dig>  <cit> . as reported previously  <cit> , two of the orfs in this plasmid were predicted to encode products with similarity to proteins involved in secretion of bacteriocins in other bacteria. upon testing the e <dig> strain in a bacteriocin production assay using wild-type m. catarrhalis strain o35e as the indicator strain, the growth of the indicator strain was inhibited in the area immediately around the e <dig> strain . in control experiments, o35e did not kill either itself  or e <dig>  and e <dig> did not kill itself . this result indicated that strain e <dig> was capable of producing one or more factors that inhibited the growth of strain o35e.

characterization of relevant protein products encoded by plq510
in a previous publication  <cit> , orf <dig>  in plq <dig>  was described as encoding a protein with homology to the colicin v secretion protein of e. coli  <cit>  whereas orf <dig>   encoded a protein that was most similar to the colicin v secretion atp-binding protein cvab  <cit> . analysis of the similarities between the amino acid sequences of the mcba and mcbb proteins and those of proteins in sequence databases was next assessed using blast . both mcba and mcbb were found to be members of well-populated protein families. mcba belongs to the hlyd family of so-called membrane-fusion proteins . these proteins form a periplasm-spanning tube that extends from an abc-type transporter in the plasma membrane to a tolc-like protein in the outer membrane  <cit> . an alignment  <cit>  of mcba to e. coli hlyd showed that the two proteins are approximately 19% identical. likewise, the primary structure of mcbb is similar to that of the e. coli protein hlyb protein; their sequence identity is ~27%. hlyb is an abc-type transporter that is presumably dimeric. it has two main domains: the n-terminal domain spans the plasma membrane, facilitating the export of its cognate substrate, while the c-terminal domain uses the energy of atp hydrolysis to drive the export of the substrate against a concentration gradient  <cit> . although the degree of sequence identity between the m. catarrhalis and e. coli proteins is modest, it is not unreasonable to assume that they may share analogous functions.

identification of the m. catarrhalis bacteriocin and immunity factor genes
immediately downstream from mcbb, two overlapping and small putative orfs were detected. the first of these, designated mcbc , contained 303-nt in plq <dig> and was predicted to encode a protein containing  <dig> amino acids . blast analysis showed that this polypeptide had little similarity to other proteins or known bacteriocins. however, examination of the sequence of amino acids 25- <dig> in this protein revealed that it was similar to the leader sequence of the double-glycine  bacteriocin family including e. coli colicin v  and other double-glycine peptides of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  <cit>  .

the second very small orf was designated mcbi  and overlapped the mcbc orf, contained  <dig> nt, and encoded a predicted protein comprised of  <dig> amino acids. similar to mcbc, this small protein did not have significant sequence similarity to other proteins in sequence databases. although the blast search algorithm can find similar sequences, they are statistically poor . despite this fact, the results of subjecting these sequences to the psipred  <cit>  secondary-structure prediction algorithm suggest that these proteins are not simply random coils. this algorithm predicts that approximately 50% of the residues of both of these small proteins belong to a regular secondary structural element. for mcbi, the algorithm predicts four α-helices; the average confidence score for residues with non-coil predictions is  <dig> , where  <dig> = highest confidence and  <dig> = low confidence. the prediction for mcbi is superior to that for mcbc. for mcbc, the algorithm predicts seven β-strands and one α-helix; the average confidence score for these secondary structural elements is  <dig> . it is noteworthy that the psipred algorithm predicts four α-helices for mcbi; the colicin e <dig> immunity factor is known to comprise three α-helices and one  <dig> helix  <cit> .

analysis of potential transcriptional linkage among the orfs in the mcb locus
reverse transcriptase-pcr was used to assess possible linkage among the mcba, mcbb, mcbc, and mcbi orfs in plq <dig>  primer pairs were designed to overlap the three regions separating these orfs . rna was isolated from m. catarrhalis e <dig> in the logarithmic phase of growth, reverse-transcribed, and then pcr-amplified using these three pairs of oligonucleotide primers. positive rt-pcr reactions were observed for all three sets of primers , indicating that these four orfs are likely transcribed together to yield a polycistronic mrna in m. catarrhalis e <dig> 

the mcb locus is present in the chromosome of some m. catarrhalis wild-type strains
a total of  <dig> wild-type m. catarrhalis strains were tested in the bacteriocin production assay with strain o35e as the indicator strain. thirteen strains  were found to inhibit the growth of o35e . to determine whether the mcbabci locus was present in these strains, chromosomal dna isolated from four of these putative bacteriocin-producing strains and from four strains that did not inhibit strain o35e was used in pcr with primers that would amplify a  <dig> -kb product spanning the mcbabc genes as found in plq <dig> . all four of the bacteriocin-producing strains  yielded the predicted  <dig> -kb pcr product whereas the four bacteriocin-negative strains  did not yield any detectable pcr product. subsequent plasmid dna extraction from two of these bacteriocin-positive strains  showed no plasmid dna detectable by agarose gel electrophoretic methods , suggesting that the mcbabci locus in these strains was located in the chromosome.

the mcbabci locus in both m. catarrhalis o12e and v <dig> was amplified by pcr and subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis. comparison of the nucleotide sequence of the mcba and mcbb orfs from plq <dig> with the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding orfs in o12e and v <dig> showed at least 97% identity. similarly, the deduced amino acid sequences for each of the three predicted mcba and mcbb proteins were at least 98% identical. the proteins predicted to be encoded by the mcbc orf in both plq <dig> and in the v <dig> chromosome differed by only one amino acid . however, the protein encoded by the mcbc orf in strain o12e was shorter by  <dig> aa than that encoded by the mcbc orfs in plq <dig> and v1120; this difference resulted from a change in the predicted translational initiation codon in strain o12e . the remaining  <dig> aa in the o12e mcbc protein differed by two residues from aa 25- <dig> in the plq <dig> mcbc protein and by one residue from aa 25- <dig> in the v <dig> mcbc proteins . the proteins encoded by the mcbi orfs from plq <dig>  o12e, and v <dig> were identical.

construction of in-frame deletion mutations in the mcb locus in strain o12e
the o12eΔmcba mutant was constructed as described in materials and methods, such that mcba amino acids 8- <dig> are missing. pcr amplicons derived from the mutated plasmids plq <dig> mcbb::kan and plq <dig> mcbc::kan were used to transform o12e to obtain kanamycin-resistant mcbb and mcbc mutants. these kanamycin-resistant transformants were then used as targets for transformation by pcr amplicons that contained in-frame deletions within the mcbb and mcbc orfs as described in materials and methods . strain o12eΔmcbb has mcbb amino acids 8- <dig> deleted, whereas strain o12eΔmcbc has mcbc amino acids 3- <dig> deleted . in contrast to the parent strain o12e , each of these three mutants  was unable to kill strain o35e.

the mcbi gene encodes an immunity factor
to determine whether the mcbi gene encoded an immunity factor, the mcbi gene from m. catarrhalis o12e was cloned into the plasmid vector pww <dig> to obtain paa <dig>  a recombinant m. catarrhalis o35e strain containing paa <dig> with the cloned mcbi gene  was resistant to killing by strain o12e. in contrast, both o35e  and o35e containing the empty vector pww <dig>  were killed by strain o12e.

cloning and expression of the mcbc gene
the m. catarrhalis o12e mcbc gene was cloned into pww <dig> and modified such that the encoded mcbc protein contained six histidine residues at its c-terminus . when expressed in the o12e.mcbc::kan mutant, the presence of this his-tagged mcbc protein allowed killing of strain o35e , although the degree of killing appeared to be slightly less than that obtained with the wild-type o12e strain . in contrast, neither the o12e.mcbc::kan mutant  nor this same mutant containing only the pww <dig> vector  killed o35e. analysis of the purified his-tagged mcbc protein showed that it migrated in sds-page  in a manner consistent with its calculated molecular weight of ~ <dig>  . this purified his-tagged mcbc protein did not kill o35e .

competitive growth experiments
two different sets of co-culture experiments were performed to determine whether expression of the mcbc bacteriocin would confer a growth advantage on a m. catarrhalis strain containing the mcbabci locus. in the first, the bacteriocin-producing, streptomycin-resistant strain o12e-smr and the spectinomycin-resistant, bacteriocin-sensitive mutant o35eΔmapa  <cit>  were mixed at a ratio of approximately 1: <dig> and grown in broth for  <dig> h. at the end of this growth period, o12e-smr was the vastly predominant member  of this culture. in a second set of experiments, o12e-smr was co-cultured  with either o35e containing the pww <dig> vector or the recombinant plasmid paa <dig> containing the wild-type o12e mcbi gene encoding the immunity factor. when o12e-smr was grown overnight with o35e, the bacteriocin-producing strain became predominant  in the culture. in contrast, when the o35e strain expressed the mcbi gene product from a multi-copy plasmid, this recombinant strain persisted in the presence of the bacteriocin-producing strain such that m. catarrhalis o35e cells represented  <dig> % of the total cells in the culture. it should be noted that, when all four of these strains were cultured independently in broth for 7- <dig> h, the o12e-smr strain was shown to grow at approximately the same rate and to approximately the same extent as the other three strains .

discussion
bacteriocins are proteins and peptides that are ribosomally synthesized by many bacterial species and which usually have bactericidal activity against the same species or closely related bacteria. bacteriocins range in size from the relatively large colicins  synthesized by some e. coli strains to the very small  microcins . a significant number of bacteriocins, and especially those produced by lactic acid bacteria, have been studied for their potential to be used in food preservation  <cit> . the bacteriocins produced by the lactic acid bacteria are divided into two general classes. class i bacteriocins undergo post-translational modification whereas class ii microcins do not. these class ii bacteriocins also have a characteristic leader sequence containing a double-glycine  motif which is cleaved on the c-terminal side to release the mature bacteriocin .

in this study, we report the identification of a bacteriocin produced by m. catarrhalis. despite the fact that the amino acid sequence of the mature mcbc peptide did not show any significant homology to known bacteriocins, the sequence of the first  <dig> amino acids of the m. catarrhalis o12e mcbc protein shows a high degree of conservation with leader peptides of proven and hypothetical class ii bacteriocins from other bacteria . the predicted mcbc proteins encoded by the plq <dig> plasmid  and m. catarrhalis strain v <dig>  however, were both longer than the predicted o12e mcbc protein, containing an additional  <dig> aa at the n-terminus. because all three of these strains expressed killing activity against o35e, it appears that the shorter version of the mcbc protein is functional with respect to bactericidal activity. examination of the nucleotide sequence of the region preceding the two possible mcbc translation initiation codons in both plq <dig> and v <dig> indicated that the better predicted shine-dalgarno site was located immediately upstream of the second atg ; this is the same atg predicted to be the translation initiation codon for the o12e mcbc orf.

export of class ii bacteriocins involves both an atp-binding cassette  transporter and an accessory protein belonging to the membrane-fusion protein family  <cit> . the former protein also possesses proteolytic activity in an n-terminal domain  <cit>  which belongs to the c <dig> peptidase superfamily . the genes encoding both of these membrane-bound proteins are frequently located together with the orfs encoding the bacteriocin and the host immunity factor  <cit> . reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis of the locus in plq <dig> containing the gene encoding the mcbc bacteriocin  indicated that it is located in an operon where it is preceded by the mcba and mcbb genes which encode a predicted accessory protein  belonging to the membrane-fusion family and an abc transporter , respectively. a previous blast-based survey identified the protein encoded by mcbb as an abc transporter, although no more detailed analysis of this protein was provided by these authors  <cit> .

the 3'-end of the mcbc gene is overlapped by the 5'-end of another orf which encodes the immunity factor mcbi. similar orf overlaps, described previously for other bacteriocin-producing systems, would allow tight co-regulation of the production of the bacteriocin and its cognate immunity factor  <cit> . the function of the mcbi protein was deduced from an experiment in which the presence of the mcbi gene on a multi-copy plasmid protected the mcbc-sensitive o35e strain from killing by the mcbc-producing o12e strain . the mcbi protein contains only  <dig> amino acids and did not show a high degree of amino acid sequence homology to other immunity proteins, a result which is not unusual  <cit> . however, the predicted secondary structure of mcbi showed the presence of four α-helices, a feature that is conserved among class iia immunity proteins  <cit> . precisely how the immunity protein confers protection against its cognate bacteriocin has been elucidated for at least one class ii bacteriocin  <cit> .

while the mcbabci locus was first identified in the plasmid plq <dig>  the ability to kill o35e was not restricted to the e <dig> strain carrying this plasmid. instead,  <dig> of another  <dig> m. catarrhalis strains tested in the present study could kill o35e. moreover, the presence of the bacteriocin locus in at least some of these other m. catarrhalis strains is apparently not dependent on the presence of an extrachromosomal element. two m. catarrhalis strains  which were able to kill o35e also had the mcba, mcbb, and mcbc genes located in their chromosome in the absence of any plasmids detectable by a basic plasmid isolation technique. in this regard, it is interesting to note that the original report describing the existence of plq <dig> in strain e <dig> indicated that some plq <dig> plasmid sequences were detected by southern blot analysis in the chromosome of another m. catarrhalis strain that apparently lacked plasmids  <cit> .

efforts to obtain killing activity with filter-sterilized, spent culture supernatant fluids from a m. catarrhalis strain containing the mcbabci locus were not successful . it is interesting that the killing zone produced by the strains carrying the mcbabci locus is very small . it is possible that the in vitro growth conditions used in this study were not optimal for bacteriocin production by m. catarrhalis, and that there may exist an environmental signal which will increase synthesis and release of this bacteriocin. other bacteriocins can often be concentrated from spent culture supernatant fluids  <cit> , and it is difficult to explain our inability to accomplish this with the mcbc protein. similarly, a purified, his-tagged mcbc protein was not able to kill a sensitive strain in vitro . whether the quantity of purified mcbc protein was insufficient, whether the purification procedure inactivated this fusion protein, or whether the his tag may have interfered with mcbc bactericidal activity cannot be determined from the available data.

the true biological role of the mcbc bacteriocin remains to be determined. results presented in the present study suggest that the mcbc protein likely has a relatively narrow range of activity, apparently being only able to kill m. catarrhalis strains that are lacking the mcbabci locus. expression of mcbc might mediate some type of intraspecies competition in the nasopharynx, as has been described for the blpmn bacteriocins of streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . in addition, inactivation of a gene involved in bacteriocin production in neisseria meningitidis was recently shown to adversely affect the ability of the mutant to colonize in a human nasal pharyngeal organ culture model  <cit> .

in a preliminary effort to determine whether mcbc might be able to kill other members of the normal flora of the human oropharynx and thereby facilitate colonization of the mucosa by m. catarrhalis, we performed growth inhibition experiments using two different α-hemolytic streptococci  as the indicator strains. however, m. catarrhalis o12e had no detectable inhibitory effect on the growth of these two strains . the limited spectrum of killing activity for mcbc also raises the possibility that it might serve to lyse other m. catarrhalis strains that lack the mcbabci locus, thereby making their dna available for lateral gene transfer via transformation of the strain containing the mcbabci operon. a similar mechanism has been described for how streptococcus mutans might use its mutacin  to acquire genes from closely related streptococcal species in vivo  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
approximately 25% of the m. catarrhalis strains tested in this study produced a bacteriocin that could kill strains of this pathogen that lacked the mcbabci locus. expression of the gene products encoded by this locus conferred a competitive advantage in vitro over a strain that did not possess this set of genes. whether this bacteriocin is expressed in vivo  remains to be determined, but production of this bacteriocin could facilitate lateral gene transfer among m. catarrhalis strains.
