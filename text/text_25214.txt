BACKGROUND
the myc/max/mad network of transcriptional regulators is essential to control many aspects of cell physiology  <cit> . myc was originally identified as oncogene in several different chicken retroviruses. subsequently the three human myc genes, myc, mycn and mycl were found deregulated in the large majority of human tumors  <cit> . the potent capacity of myc to transform cells has also been supported by a large number of studies in both primary cells and established cell lines and in animal models. central to the ability to transform cells is myc's function as transcriptional regulator in controlling the expression of a large number of target genes. this explains, at least in part, the broad biological activities associated of myc  <cit> . the functions of myc in gene expression control depend largely on its interaction with max, the central component of the myc/max/mad network.

mad proteins are alternative binding partners of max  <cit> . six different mad proteins have been identified. mad1- <dig> are highly related, while mnt and mga are considerably larger multi-domain proteins. similar to myc, the mad proteins are transcriptional regulators, with mad1- <dig> primarily described as repressors. unlike myc proteins, the mads have not been linked to human diseases, in particular they appear not to be tumor suppressors as one might have expected. for mad1- <dig> the reason for their apparent lack to function as tumor suppressors may be in part due to their broad and overlapping expression pattern, suggesting that more than one mad family member would need to be inactivated in tumors  <cit> . in addition, mad proteins, best studied for mad <dig>  have anti-apoptotic activity and thus may antagonize the pro-apoptotic functions of myc proteins  <cit> . this activity of mad proteins may be indispensable for tumor development. in support, one of the few mad <dig> target genes that has been identified is the tumor suppressor gene pten  <cit> . mad <dig>  which functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor by recruiting histone deacetylase-containing complexes  <cit> , represses the pten promoter directly  <cit> . this contributes to the anti-apoptotic phenotype elicited by mad <dig>  the analysis of granulocytes from mice lacking mad <dig> revealed increased sensitivity to pro-apoptotic conditions  <cit> , further supporting the view that mad <dig> protects cells from different apoptotic stimuli.

in addition to the anti-apoptotic function, mad <dig> has been suggested to control proliferation and differentiation antagonistically to myc  <cit> . indeed the unscheduled expression of mad <dig> interferes with cell proliferation and the lack of mad <dig> results in a differentiation defect of granulocytes  <cit> . during the studies to elucidate the functions of mad <dig> in proliferation and differentiation, it had been noted early on that the expression of the mad <dig> gene is highly regulated, generally reciprocal to the regulation of myc genes  <cit> . moreover mad <dig> expression is directly downregulated by myc . in particular several differentiation inducing agents, including transforming growth factor β , retinoic acid, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor , were identified as stimulators of mad <dig> expression  <cit> . these findings led us to address the question how the mad <dig> promoter is organized and how signals of these differentiation factors control gene expression. the mad <dig> promoter contains a cpg island as part of a roughly  <dig> bp proximal promoter region highly conserved between humans and rodents  <cit> . this region is responsive to g-csf, integrating signals transduced from the g-csf receptor by stat <dig> and by the ras-raf-erk pathway. this regulation of the mad <dig> promoter by g-csf is in agreement with the described role of this cytokine and of mad <dig> in the control of granulocyte differentiation and survival  <cit> .

cytokines of the tgfβ family have broad activities in controlling cell physiology, including proliferation, differentiation and survival  <cit> . tgfβ signals through tgfβ type ii and i receptors with ser/thr kinase activity, thereby activating smad proteins, in particular smad <dig> and  <dig> in combination with smad <dig>  these proteins translocate to the cell nucleus and form complexes with additional molecules to control the expression of target genes  <cit> . we have shown previously that the phorbol ester tpa and tgfβ activate the expression of mad <dig> in u <dig> and in hacat keratinocytes, respectively  <cit> . in both systems a substantial increase in mrna expression was observed by  <dig> min, suggesting that the induction was direct. different kinetics of mad <dig> induction were observed in a clone of u <dig> promyelocytes that stably express a viral version of myc . in these cells a weak induction was observed in response to tgfβ by  <dig> hrs, possibly as a result of constitutive myc expression  <cit> . to understand in more detail how tgfβ <dig> regulates mad <dig> gene expression, we addressed how this cytokine affects mad <dig> promoter activity. it appears that tgfβ <dig> stimulates mad <dig> through elements proximal to the core promoter.

RESULTS
rapid activation of mad <dig> by tgfβ
during cell proliferation and differentiation, the mad <dig> gene is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. one of the regulatory cytokines is tgfβ <dig>  which is known to induce mad <dig> in keratinocytes and in u937-myc <dig> promyelocytes  <cit> . to further evaluate the role of tgfβ <dig> in regulating mad <dig>  we performed time course experiments. tgfβ <dig> rapidly activated mad <dig> mrna expression in u <dig> cells . in parallel, mad <dig> protein became detectable within  <dig> hrs of tgfβ <dig> stimulation . thus the induction of mad <dig> protein follows closely the up-regulation seen at the mrna level. the induction of mad <dig> expression was dependent on the tgfβ receptor  since the tgfβri inhibitor sb <dig> blocked mad <dig> activation . moreover inhibition of the mapk p <dig> resulted in a partial inhibition of mad <dig> expression in response to tgfβ <dig>  whereas the inhibition of jnk or erk kinases did not repress mad <dig> expression . the activities of the inhibitors were verified by analyzing the phosphorylation of the relevant kinases . these findings indicate that tgfβ <dig> may signal by different pathways to the mad <dig> promoter. indeed the tgfβr is known to activate several different signaling cascades in addition to smad transcription factors, including different map kinases and the pi3k-akt pathway  <cit> .

mad <dig> has been demonstrated to interfere with cell proliferation in some cell types  <cit> . therefore we measured whether the induction of mad <dig> by tgfβ <dig> affected the proliferation of u <dig> tumor cells. however the early tgfβ1-stimulated induction of mad <dig> was not sufficient to block u <dig> proliferation , similar to the observations made in u937-myc <dig> cells  <cit> . our findings suggest that tumor cells like u <dig> have the possibility to bypass at least transiently the repressive function of mad <dig> in cell proliferation.

c/ebpα/β heterodimers bind constitutively to the mad <dig> promoter
the mad <dig> promoter does not contain any obvious smad binding sites in the proximal region. indeed a recent study suggested that smad2/ <dig> stimulate mad <dig> expression independent of smad <dig>  possibly through an indirect mechansism  <cit> . moreover it has been found that smad proteins may interact with c/ebp transcription factors to control gene expression  <cit> . since we have shown previously that c/ebps control the transcription of mad <dig> in response to the cytokine g-csf in rk <dig> rabbit epithelial cells  <cit> , we addressed the role of c/ebp transcription factors in human cells. transient transfection experiments in hela cells demonstrated that c/ebpα and β, and to a lesser extend c/ebpε, were able to stimulate - <dig> to + <dig> and - <dig> to + <dig>  mad <dig> promoter reporter gene constructs . moreover knockdown of c/ebpβ reduced mad <dig> promoter reporter gene activity, suggesting that its expression is controlled by endogenous c/ebpβ . this appears to be a direct effect since the mutation of the two ccaat box-like sequences in the promoter proximal region affected the sensitivity to c/ebpβ . deletion of box <dig> reduced, while deletion of either box <dig> or both elements together eliminated promoter activity in response to c/ebpβ . together these findings demonstrate that, similar to the observations in rk <dig> cells, c/ebps also control mad <dig> expression in human cells.

to address whether tgfβ <dig> might affect c/ebp binding to the mad <dig> promoter, chip experiments were performed. specific c/ebpβ binding to the core-promoter region was observed, whereas only weak interaction with a more distal promoter region could be detected . c/ebpβ was found at the mad <dig> promoter prior to tgfβ <dig> signaling . stimulation by tgfβ <dig> did not result in altered binding. thus c/ebp proteins interact with the promoter independent of tgfβ <dig> signaling. the binding of c/ebp proteins to the ccaat box motifs, both appear only to be half-sites  <cit> , was further evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays . neither of the two half-sites  was bound by c/ebpα or c/ebpβ homodimers alone when expressed in hek <dig> cells . for control efficient and specific binding of c/ebpβ and c/ebpα to a ccaat box of the neutrophil elastase gene was measurable, as reported previously  <cit>  . since the findings using chip and emsa were contradictory, we expanded the emsa experiments by evaluating the binding of c/ebpα/β heterodimers. in contrast to the homodimers, the heterodimeric c/ebp complexes interacted with the ccaat box <dig>  and less well with ccaat box <dig> . the presence of a heterodimeric complex at ccaat box <dig> was verified using c/ebpα and β specific antibodies. both antibodies were able to supershift the complexes observed, further validating that c/ebpα/β heterodimers were able to bind to the mad <dig> promoter. to address whether the chromatin embedded mad <dig> promoter was bound by c/ebpα/β heterodimers, re-chip experiments were performed by immunoprecipitating first chromatin-bound c/ebpβ. the bound material was released and re-immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for either c/ebpα or c/ebpβ  in comparison to a control . the specific signals obtained with both c/ebp antibodies suggested that indeed the mad <dig> promoter was occupied by c/ebpα/β heterodimers. again this was largely independent of tgfβ signaling .

sp transcription factors bind to the mad <dig> promoter independent of tgfβ signaling
in addition to ccaat boxes, the proximal promoter region of the mad <dig> gene contains  <dig> prominent gc boxes . to test whether sp proteins can bind to either of these two gc boxes, we performed emsa and chip experiments. prominent binding to an oligonucleotide spanning gc box <dig>  which is flanked by the two ccaat boxes, was observed in emsa experiments using u <dig> cell extracts . binding to gc box <dig> was weaker . supershift experiments using specific antisera indicated that both sp <dig> and sp <dig> proteins bind to gc box <dig> . moreover both proteins bound constitutively to the chromatin embedded proximal mad <dig> promoter that contains gc box <dig> and no change in response to tgfβ <dig> was measurable . similarly the binding of sp <dig> and sp <dig> to the mad <dig> promoter was not affected by g-csf , indicating that these transcription factors as well as c/ebp proteins are constitutively interacting with the mad <dig> promoter.

c/ebp and sp transcription factors cooperate in stimulating the mad <dig> promoter
since the ccaat and gc boxes are in close proximity within the mad <dig> promoter , we addressed whether sp <dig> and c/ebpβ were able to cooperate on mad <dig> reporter gene constructs. while sp <dig> alone had no effect on the expression of the reporter gene, it substantially stimulated c/ebpβ-dependent expression . this observation was further validated by expressing a dominant negative form of sp <dig> , which lacks the transactivation domain. sp1dn repressed efficiently c/ebpβ-induced mad <dig> promoter reporter gene expression . the cooperative effect of sp <dig> and c/ebpβ was dependent on the gc and ccaat boxes . together these findings suggest that sp and c/ebp proteins bind to the proximal mad <dig> promoter and cooperate in activating the mad <dig> promoter.

smad <dig> interacts with and activates the mad <dig> promoter dependent on c/ebp and sp binding sites
next we evaluated whether smad proteins are involved in activating the mad <dig> promoter by using the - <dig> to + <dig> mad <dig> promoter reporter gene construct. this reporter was stimulated by a combination of smad <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> but the activity of these factors was not enhanced by coexpressing a constitutive active tgfβri  . all these constructs however were active since a smad binding element reporter  was strongly activated by smads and tgfβrca . in the absence of exogenous smad proteins the tgfβrca was unable to significantly activate mad <dig> promoter reporter constructs . we further evaluated which smad protein stimulated the mad <dig> promoter reporter. we found by testing all combinations that only smad <dig> was stimulatory . the smad <dig> responsive region was mapped to the promoter fragment that contains the two c/ebp half sites and one sp binding site, i.e. gc box <dig> . these response elements appeared to be relevant because mutation of these sites in a reporter containing the - <dig> to - <dig> mad <dig> promoter fragment upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter  resulted in almost complete loss of smad <dig> responsiveness . consistent with this, c/ebpα and smad <dig> cooperated on the - <dig> mad <dig> promoter reporter . finally we addressed whether smad <dig> interacted with the mad <dig> promoter. indeed we found that smad <dig> was bound to the mad <dig> promoter but not to an irrelevant promoter  . however stimulation of the u <dig> cells with tgfβ did not alter significantly the interaction of smad <dig> with the promoter. together these findings demonstrate that smad <dig> functions as an activating transcription factor for the mad <dig> promoter. the lack of regulation by coexpressing smad <dig> with tgfβrca as measured by reporter gene assays may be due to insufficient chromatin formation on the transfected dna and/or additional important signaling compounds are missing.

tgfβ <dig> stimulates ser <dig> phosphorylation of pol ii
to further evaluate how the mad <dig> promoter is activated, we analyzed acetylation of histone h <dig>  and trimethylation at lys  <dig> of histone h <dig>  before and after tgfβ <dig> stimulation. both are marks for active promoters. we observed h3ac throughout the locus and h3k4me <dig> at the promoter, however, none of these marks was significantly modified by tgfβ <dig> stimulation . these findings suggest that the mad <dig> promoter is in an open configuration, similar to what has been observed recently for many promoters of regulated genes  <cit> . this is supported by our previous studies using nucleosomal mapping demonstrating open chromatin at the mad <dig> proximal promoter  <cit> . consistent with an open configuration is our observation that polymerase ii  occupied the mad <dig> promoter constitutively . pol ii was also detected in the gene body, where its binding increased in response to tgfβ <dig> treatment . a key step in activating transcription is the differential phosphorylation of pol ii  <cit> . it is phosphorylated at ser- <dig> of its c-terminal domain , a modification that defines a preactivation state. upon stimulation, pol ii becomes phosphorylated at ser- <dig> of the ctd, which coincides with elongating polymerase. therefore we addressed whether phosphorylation at ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> was altered in response to tgfβ <dig>  indeed we observed an increase in ser- <dig> phosphorylation upon tgfβ <dig> stimulation and a concomitant decrease of ser- <dig> phosphorylation of pol ii both at the promoter and in the gene body . thus tgfβ <dig> regulates pol ii phosphorylation and activity.

CONCLUSIONS
we observed that c/ebp and sp transcription factors bind constitutively to the proximal mad <dig> promoter. in addition smad <dig>  a factor typically activated by tgfβ signaling, also was found constitutively on the mad <dig> promoter, despite the fact that no obvious binding sites for smad proteins are found. while the gc boxes are consensus binding sites for sp <dig>  the proposed ccaat boxes are deviating considerably from c/ebp consensus sequences. in fact, both elements that were identified functionally, represent only half sites  <cit> . consistent with this interpretation, these dna elements do not bind efficiently c/ebp homodimers in emsa experiments in vitro. surprisingly substantial binding was only measurable with c/ebpα/β heterodimers in these emsa experiments. nevertheless both factors were able to stimulate mad <dig> promoter reporter genes. we did however not observe a strong synergistic activation by the two proteins, possibly due to abundant endogenous c/ebp factors . we suggest that c/ebp and sp transcription factors form a platform for incoming signals as exemplified by g-csf  <cit>  and possibly tgfβ <dig>  in the case of g-csf, stat <dig> is recruited by c/ebps, requiring mapk signaling. our new findings suggest that tgfβ <dig> signaling activates smad proteins and stimulates mapk signaling. the activation of mapk might be a common pathway that controls at least in part mad <dig> expression. consistent with this interpretation, smad <dig> cooperated with c/ebp proteins to activate mad <dig> promoter reporter genes. the finding that smad <dig> was bound to the mad <dig> promoter suggests that smad <dig> is directly recruited to the mad <dig> promoter by binding to c/ebps or c/ebp associated factors. because the gc box was also relevant, we propose that a large transcription factor/cofactor complex interacts with the identified promoter proximal region, including smad <dig>  however, we point out that we cannot exclude direct binding of smad <dig> to the mad <dig> promoter. although no obvious binding sites could be detected, smad binding sites are rather short and leave the possibility open that smad <dig> forms a dimeric or multimeric complex with other factors, in which smad <dig> might bind directly to dna.

the signals that are integrated at the proximal mad <dig> promoter translate into the activation of pol ii as measured by its progression into the gene body and the concomitant change in the phosphorylation of the c-terminal domain of pol ii. this is consistent with recent observations on many genes, which have provided evidence that pol ii phosphorylated at ser- <dig> is located at the promoter in a preactivated or paused mode. the switch to ser- <dig> phosphorylation, possibly by the recruitment and activation of the p-tefb kinase cdk <dig>  results in the activation and promoter clearance of pol ii  <cit> . thus this represents a situation as it is now becoming evident at many different promoters that are being studied in detail. it is worth noting that pol ii was found to be associated with the mad <dig> promoter prior to stimulation with cytokines. thus at least in u <dig> tumor cells, the mad <dig> promoter is preoccupied by pol ii and thus allows for rapid activation by multiple signals. it will now be of interest to specifically dissect how different cytokines use the c/ebp-sp transcription factor platform to activate the paused pol ii.
