BACKGROUND
resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides in anopheles malaria mosquito vectors is now widespread throughout sub-saharan africa  <cit> . the recent gains in reducing the burden of malaria, achieved largely by the scale-up of long lasting insecticide treated nets , are under threat as pyrethroids represent the only insecticide class approved for use on llins.

the south-west of burkina faso was one of the first regions to report pyrethroid resistance in the local malaria vector population  <cit> . since the late 1990s the level of resistance has gradually increased with the intensive agricultural activity in the area a likely contributing factor  <cit> . a recent survey of resistance in the village of vallée du kou in the south-west of the country, conducted between  <dig> and  <dig>  has highlighted the scale of the problem with resistance levels of over 1000-fold described  <cit> . laboratory assays found that none of the llins currently used throughout the country gave acceptable levels of mortality against local mosquitoes, raising serious concerns over the efficacy of current vector control strategies in the country.

the main resistance mechanisms to pyrethroids include target site mutations in the voltage sodium channel , l1014f, l1014s and n1575y) and metabolic resistance including the over-expression of the three major detoxification enzyme families , glutathione-s-transferases  and the carboxylesterases) . while the rise and spread of the kdr alleles in anopheles gambiae throughout sub-saharan african are undoubtedly associated with ddt and pyrethroid resistance, they do not account for all of the variation in the phenotype  <cit> .

the design of microarray-based platforms for characterising gene expression profiles in anopheles gambiae, initially based on detoxification enzymes  <cit> , and more recently, using whole-genome wide arrays  <cit> , has provided evidence for specific genes contributing to insecticide resistance in wild-caught an. gambiae . commonly over-expressed genes have been identified in independent studies across sub-saharan africa including, for example, specific p <dig> enzymes  which have been shown to metabolize pyrethroids and other insecticide classes  <cit> . most of these transcription studies conducted to date have compared resistant mosquitoes, collected at a single time point, to either sympatric non-exposed insects or laboratory susceptible strains. few studies have followed transcriptional changes in wild-caught an. gambiae, from a single origin, displaying increasingly high levels of resistance at the whole-genome level.

we followed the rapid rise of deltamethrin resistance in the village of vallée du kou  <dig>  and collected mosquitoes either exposed or non-exposed to deltamethrin in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> for transcriptional analysis against laboratory susceptible strains. using a filtering process based on the over-expression of candidates in vk <dig>  as well as an increase in expression from  <dig> to  <dig>  we generated a list of candidate genes, including well-studied detoxification enzymes, transporters and cuticular genes that are likely contributing to the exceptionally strong pyrethroid resistance phenotype in this population. the investigation also highlighted that target site resistance, whilst highly prevalent, was not strongly associated with survival after pyrethroid exposure.

RESULTS
deltamethrin resistance associated gene expression
two whole-transcriptome microarray experiments were performed on vk <dig> an. coluzzi collected as part of june  <dig> and july  <dig> bioassays  to identify candidate genes associated with deltamethrin resistance. this included mosquitoes that had survived more than 10 hours exposure to the diagnostic dose of pyrethroids, an unprecedented high level of resistance for malaria vectors. a detailed experimental design is given in figure  <dig>  in  <dig>  we expanded the study to include a second susceptible strain and an additional field strain  with a less intense resistance phenotype  to improve confidence in our candidate gene list. to identify candidate genes in vk <dig> we made three underlying assumptions: a) candidate resistance genes are more highly expressed in resistant field populations versus susceptible lab colonies , b) the same underlying mechanisms were responsible for resistance in  <dig> and  <dig> and c) genes conferring pyrethroid resistance would be more highly over-expressed in vk <dig> compared to ten. a detailed analysis schema is provided in figure  <dig> and the methods.figure  <dig> 
interwoven loop designs for microarray experiments performed in  <dig> and  <dig>  in  <dig>  deltamethrin selected mosquitoes from vk <dig> , unexposed mosquitoes from vk <dig>  and the mali susceptible lab strain  were compared. in  <dig>  four mosquitoes populations were compared including deltamethrin selected mosquitoes from vk <dig> , unexposed mosquitoes from a deltamethrin resistant population approximately 120 km from vk <dig>  tengrela , the susceptible mal strain and a second fully susceptible lab strain from n’gousso, cameroon . the direction of the arrows represents a cy <dig> to cy <dig> hybridisation and three biological replicates were used for each comparison.

genes over-expressed in resistant field populations
the filtering approach which compared all field resistant populations to the susceptible laboratory strains, using data from both  <dig> and  <dig>  left  <dig> probes   including  <dig> cytochrome p450s,  <dig> glutathione s-transferases ,  <dig> carboxylesterases and many other non–detoxification genes. the top five over-expressed detoxification genes based on the vk7/mal comparison in  <dig> included gste <dig> , cyp4g <dig> , gsts1_ <dig> , cyp9j <dig>  and cyp6p <dig> . the most over-expressed non-detoxification genes consisted of an atp synthase , glycoside hydrolase , a cuticular protein with chitin binding domains cpap3-a1b  and a takeout protein associated with insect circadian clocks . additional over-expressed genes, which were also up-regulated in later filtering steps , included an aquaporin , chymotrypsin- <dig>  and the carboxylesterase, coeae3g  .

genes expressed at higher levels in deltamethrin survivors from  <dig> compared to 2011
out of the  <dig> probes over-expressed in all the field resistant populations compared to the laboratory susceptible strains,  <dig> probes had a higher fold change in  <dig> than in  <dig> based on the vk7/mal comparison . as resistance levels increased dramatically between these years we hypothesised that this probe list may include genes contributing to the resistance phenotype. the five gsts genes , gstms <dig> , gsts1_ <dig> , gstm <dig> , and gste <dig> ), five out the fifteen cytochrome p450s  and cyp9m <dig> ) and two of out the three carboxylesterases  and coeae4g ) remained after this filtering approach. the highest fold-change differences between  <dig> and  <dig> were observed for genes already showing high constitutive expression including the chymotrypsin- <dig> , aquaporin , cuticular protein cpap3-a1b  and the atp synthase . the p <dig>  cyp4g <dig> , which has been implicated in pyrethroid resistance elsewhere  <cit> , also showed an increase in expression in  <dig>

genes expressed at higher levels in vk <dig> compared to ten
we included an. coluzzi mosquitoes from tengrela  in the  <dig> experiment to see whether a common set of genes were up-regulated in pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes from vk <dig> and ten. considering that resistance is higher in vk <dig> than ten, we only retained probes significantly over-expressed in vk <dig> compared to ten. this gave a final candidate gene list containing  <dig> probes . a hierarchical clustering analysis based on the expression profiles of three comparisons between vk7/mal , vk7/mal  and vk7/ng  is presented in figure  <dig>  if putative alternative transcripts of the same gene and duplicate probes are removed, the candidate gene list reduces further to  <dig> unique genes. several of the detoxification genes having higher fc in  <dig>  including cyp4g <dig>  cyp9j <dig>  cyp9m <dig>  coeae3g, gste <dig>  were retained in this list as well the components of the cuticle  and the chymotrypsin- <dig>  aquaporin and atp synthase .figure  <dig>

genes expressed at higher levels in ten compared to vk7
interestingly, several detoxification genes were more highly expressed in ten than vk <dig> in  <dig>  . of all genes up-regulated in ten , the highest fold changes were for cyp6z <dig>  and cyp6p <dig> . both of these p450s also showed a significant increase in basal expression in vk <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  suggesting that, given their reported role in pyrethroid resistance  <cit> , these enzymes may be involved in resistance in both tengrela and vk <dig> 

target-site resistance
all three kdr mutations  in the voltage gated sodium channel have been reported in an. gambiae s.l from south-west burkina faso  <cit> . dead and surviving vk <dig> mosquitoes after exposure to the lt <dig> of deltamethrin were screened for each mutation to determine whether, in addition to the increases in gene expression described above, target-site resistance contributes to the strong resistance phenotype. the 1014s kdr allele was not found in any sample. the frequency of the 1014f allele in the 2011- <dig> control samples of an. coluzzi was high  but did not differ significantly between date of collection  . a similar frequency of  <dig>  of 1014f was observed in  <dig> from tengrela . samples collected in july  <dig> from the different breeding sites in vk <dig> and tengrela showed a similar frequency  . the 1575y kdr allele had a frequency of between  <dig>  and  <dig>  during the collection period in both vk <dig> and tengrela. no significant increase or decrease in the frequency of n1575y was observed during this time .table  <dig>

deltamethrin resistance and kdr haplotype association

discussion
in this study, we applied a robust microarray-approach to determine the transcriptional profile of an an. coluzzi population undergoing further selection on top of an already strong pyrethroid resistance phenotype. we previously documented that deltamethrin resistance ratios  increased from  <dig> to  <dig> in a single calendar year from the village of vk <dig> in burkina faso  <cit> . by analysing transcription levels of an. coluzzi from vk <dig> in both  <dig> and  <dig>  this provided a unique opportunity to determine whether gene expression levels were simultaneously rising with pyrethroid resistance in a single wild-caught population of an. coluzzi from south-west burkina faso.

candidate genes for deltamethrin resistance in vk7
according to our hypotheses of over-expression in field resistant mosquitoes compared to laboratory susceptible strains, increased expression in vk <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  and finally, higher expression in vk <dig> than the more moderate resistance phenotype displayed in nearby tengrela, we filtered microarray probes down to a final list of  <dig> representing  <dig> genes which are potentially contributing to deltamethrin resistance in vk <dig>  these encode enzymes and proteins with both detoxification and non-detoxification functions. this gene list was compared to data generated using the same microarray platform, comparing gene expression in deltamethrin survivors of an. coluzzi from three independent sites in cote d’ivoire, with the n’gousso susceptible strain . one third of the  <dig> genes associated with deltamethrin resistance in burkina faso were also found over expressed in all three populations from côte d’ivoire, including cyp4g <dig> and the cuticular proteins cpap3-a1a and cpap3-a1b . this suggests that similar mechanisms could underlie the pyrethroid resistance that is spreading across western africa.

three p450s were present in the list of vk <dig> candidate probes . cyp4g <dig> is becoming increasingly associated with pyrethroid resistance with evidence for over-expression in another major vector of the an. gambiae complex, an. arabiensis  <cit> . although cyp4g <dig> does not metabolize pyrethroids directly, it may play a role in enhancing cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis as demonstrated in members of the cyp4g family previously  <cit> . the presence of additional genes with putative roles in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis , 3-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydrogenase  and fatty acyl-coa elongase ) strengthens the support for the involvement of this pathway, and cyp4g <dig>  in pyrethroid resistance in an. gambiae, although further functional validation is needed. furthermore, the cuticular proteins analogous to peritrophins  class of proteins are expressed in cuticule forming tissues and maintain the structural integrity of the cuticle  <cit> . two members of the cpap <dig> family were consistently over-expressed in vk <dig>  and cpap3-a1b agap000987-ra)). cpap3-a1b was recently over-expressed in an. gambiae from an agricultural area in northern tanzania  <cit>  and therefore this protein class warrants further investigation as part of any cuticular resistance hypothesis in this species.

the aquaporin  and chymotrypsin- <dig>  were both significantly and highly over-expressed in vk <dig>  the precise role for these proteins in insecticide resistance remains unclear. aquaporins are ubiquitous water transporting membrane proteins found in the malpighian tubule system of insects  <cit> . the aquaporin over-transcribed in this study was also the most significantly and highly over-expressed gene in a genome-wide transcriptional profile of an extremely resistant ddt strain of an. coluzzi from ghana   <cit> . the presence of aquaporins in the malpighian tubules, which are also a potential site for p450-mediated metabolism  <cit> , may represent an efflux/excretion system for insecticide detoxification. in the field of drug resistance, the loss of the activity of one of these transporters leads to resistance to melaminophenyl arsenic  and pentamidine treatment in the african trypanosomiasis parasite   <cit> . chymotrypsins are serine proteases secreted in the midgut of insects  <cit> . chymotrypsin transfected culex pipiens pallens cells treated with deltamethrin showed greater viability compared to control cells  <cit>  but it is not clear how this enzyme class would directly or indirectly increase insecticide tolerance.

other metabolic enzymes were present in our vk <dig> candidate list including two carboxylesterases  and a gst . the expression of two of these genes, coeae3g and gste <dig>  was greater in vk <dig> in  <dig> according to our qpcr assays. although the up-regulation of these enzymes has been shown in pyrethroid and ddt resistant mosquito populations elsewhere  <cit> , it is more likely that these enzymes either play a secondary role or are involved in resistance to other compounds. for example, members of the epsilon class of gsts, and in particular gste <dig>  can metabolise ddt  <cit>  and we included this in the qpcr assays given the strong evidence in its role in ddt resistance and the elevated expression in the field an. coluzzi from vk <dig> and tengrela. the vk <dig> population displays intense ddt resistance with  <dig> hours of ddt exposure inducing only  <dig> % of mortality  and it is possible that gste <dig> and/or gste <dig> are involved in resistance to ddt rather than to pyrethroids  <cit> .

as part of our filtering process to determine candidate genes from vk <dig>  we decided to choose only those genes over-expressed in vk <dig> compared to tengrela, however, when analysing this data we noticed that two strong candidate p450s for pyrethroid resistance, cyp6z <dig> and cyp6p <dig>  <cit> , were more highly expressed in tengrela in  <dig>  however, by  <dig>  a year which saw pyrethroid resistance ratios exceed 1000× in vk <dig>  <cit> , the expression of these two p450s in vk <dig> increased significantly, suggesting that these p450s may be contributing to the resistance phenotype in both locations.

the vast majority of transcriptional studies investigating the association of gene expression with insecticide resistance have focussed on the over-expression of candidate genes. while there is a large body of evidence to support this approach, the down-regulation of genes as part of key biological pathways should not be ignored. additional file  <dig> provides a list of the  <dig> probes  down-regulated in all resistant strains versus the susceptible lab colonies including those under-transcribed in vk <dig> compared to ten. this list includes many transporter proteins  and ion channels plus a small number of cytochrome p <dig> genes.

the 1014f-1575ykdr haplotype only accounts for a small portion of the resistance phenotype in vk7
the link between the kdr 1014f allele in the target sodium channel and the ability to survive pyrethroids or ddt is clear with selective sweeps acting upon this allele throughout different parts of africa  <cit> . however, it is also evident that kdr alone does not account for all of the phenotypic variation in resistance. in this study, 1014f or 1575y alone were only mildly associated with an increased ability to survive the lt <dig> for deltamethrin. the 1014f kdr diagnostic might only have a limited impact in populations with high levels of pyrethroid resistance, as reported here, and elsewhere in west africa  <cit> . the n1575y mutation is found exclusively on a 1014f haplotypic background and this haplotype has been shown to confer additional selective advantage in presence of insecticides  <cit> . the 1014f-1575y haplotype did provide some protection to deltamethrin  but the highest or observed of  <dig>  does not account for the extremely high resistance ratios observed in vk <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
using a quantitative approach to resistance monitoring we recently documented the highest level of deltamethrin resistance recorded in field-caught an. gambiae to date. transcriptional profiling of these resistant mosquitoes has identified a suite of candidate genes, which can be used to monitor resistance levels as attempts are made to mitigate against development of additional resistance in the future using new vector control tools  <cit> . furthermore, the findings presented here provide evidence for additional mechanisms which might be contributing to such a strong phenotype  and urgently need further investigation.
