BACKGROUND
yellow mustard  is an obligate out-crossing crop due to its self-incompatibilty reproduction system. it is more heat and drought tolerant, and more resistant to pod shattering and diseases such as blackleg than brassica napus and b. rapa <cit> . yellow mustard is well adapted to the semi-arid areas of western canada and has been cultivated as a condiment crop in the prairies since  <dig>  <cit> . condiment yellow mustard varieties contain a desirable high 4-hydroxybenzyl  glucosinolate  component in the seed  <cit> , which hydrolyses to produce the spicy "heat" sensation in the mouth. in addition, yellow mustard contains 3-indolylmethyl , 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl  and 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl  gsl components in the seed.

genetic linkage mapping has proven to be very useful for analyzing quantitative trait loci , tagging and cloning genes controlling desirable agronomic traits and studying genome organization and evolution. construction of genetic linkage maps based on various molecular markers has revealed the occurrence of large-scale duplication as well as extensive chromosomal rearrangement in b. rapa <cit>  and b. oleracea <cit> , b. napus <cit>  and b. juncea <cit> . qtl analysis identified two major qtls for erucic acid content in b. napus and b. juncea <cit> . five qtls for total glucosinolate content were mapped on chromosomes a <dig>  a <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig> in b. napus <cit> . mahmood et al.  <cit>  identified five qtls explaining approximately  <dig> to 45% of the total aliphatic glucosinolate content variation in b. juncea.

yellow mustard has lagged far behind oilseed brassica species in molecular marker development and application. this could be due to the following reasons. firstly, yellow mustard has a sporophytic self-incompatibility reproductive system which makes it difficult to develop homozygote parental and recombinant inbred lines required for linkage mapping. secondly, yellow mustard is not a major food crop and therefore doesn’t receive much attention and funding for genomic research. so far, only one linkage map based on restriction fragment length polymorphism  markers was constructed using populations derived from heterozygous parental lines in yellow mustard  <cit> . however, application of rflp marker technology in genetic research and breeding is limited due to the laborious procedures and high cost. single nucleotide polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  markers have proven to be very useful for construction of high density maps in b. napus and b. juncea. however, these markers have not been developed in yellow mustard yet.

intron length polymorphism  markers are highly polymorphic, co-dominant, cost-effective and cross-species applicable  <cit> . ilp primers in b. napus, b. rapa and a. thaliana have been developed  <cit> . yellow mustard, b. napus and b. rapa belong in the subtribe brassicinae  <cit> , and might have evolved from the same ancestor species as a. thaliana <cit> . therefore, the ilp primers from brassica species and arabidopsis could be used for genetic linkage mapping in yellow mustard. doubled-haploid  and inbred lines have lately been produced in yellow mustard at agriculture and agri-food canada-saskatoon research centre   <cit> . molecular markers for the fatty acid elongase  <dig>  and self- compatibility genes have also been developed in our lab  <cit> . the objectives of the present study were 1) to construct a genetic linkage map based on ilp and ssr markers using the f <dig> population derived from homozygote parental lines, 2) to identify qtls for erucic acid content and gsl components, and 3) to assign the fae <dig> and self- compatibility genes to the respective linkage groups in yellow mustard.

RESULTS
polymorphism between the parental lines y <dig> and y517
a total of  <dig> ilp primers –  <dig> from a. thaliana <cit> ,  <dig> from b. napus and  <dig> from b. rapa available in the potential intron polymorphism  database  <cit>  and  <dig> ssr markers with  <dig> from b. napus and  <dig> from b. juncea were used to screen the parental lines y <dig> and y <dig> for polymorphic markers. of the  <dig> ilp primers,  <dig>  generated clear and scorable polymorphic bands between the parental lines varying in size from 100 bp to 1300 bp. amongst the  <dig> polymorphic primers,  <dig>  each amplified dna fragments from one locus and  <dig> primers  each revealed two loci while the remaining one  revealed three polymorphic loci. to sum up, a total of  <dig> polymorphic loci were scored including  <dig> co-dominant and  <dig> dominant markers. in addition to the polymorphic loci,  <dig> monomorphic bands were amplified by  <dig> primers. taking into account both polymorphic and monomorphic bands, a total of  <dig> loci were detected by the  <dig> ilp primers with an average of  <dig>  loci/ilp primer. only  <dig>  out of the  <dig> ssr primers amplified polymorphic fragments between the parental lines, which comprised  <dig>  co-dominant and  <dig>  dominant loci. the  <dig> ilp and  <dig> ssr polymorphic markers were used to construct the linkage map with the f <dig> population of y514 × y <dig> in yellow mustard.

construction of a genetic linkage map
the  <dig> polymorphic loci between y <dig> and y <dig> were mapped on  <dig> linkage groups and covered a genetic length of  <dig>  centimorgans  . the map length of the  <dig> linkage groups ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. they were designated as sal <dig> to sal <dig> in descending order of the genetic length. sal <dig> and sal <dig> had a similar long map length and average marker interval. however, sal <dig> had one unmapped island  located between the two markers bngms <dig> and at1g <dig>  sal <dig> was similar with sal <dig> in map length, but had the largest average marker interval  and one unmapped island  located between the two markers bnappip <dig> and bnappip <dig>  sal <dig>  sal <dig>  sal <dig> and sal <dig> had similar map length ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm. sal <dig> had the smallest average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. sal <dig> and sal <dig> were similar in both map length and number of markers. sal <dig> had a map length of  <dig>  cm with an average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the shortest linkage group sal <dig> had  <dig> ilp and  <dig> ssr markers and a small average marker interval of  <dig>  cm. the fae <dig> gene was located adjacent to the marker at4g34700c on sal <dig> with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. the self-compatibility gene was located close to the marker bnappip <dig> on sal <dig> with a genetic distance of  <dig>  cm. the ilp markers were evenly distributed on the  <dig> linkage groups which likely represented the  <dig> chromosomes in yellow mustard.

the majority  of the  <dig> mapped markers segregated with the expected 1:2: <dig> or 3: <dig> mendelian ratios. however,  <dig> % markers deviated from the expected segregation ratio of 1:2: <dig> or 3: <dig> . these distorted markers were unevenly distributed on linkage groups sal <dig>  sal <dig>  sal <dig> and sal <dig>  among the distorted marker loci,  <dig>  loci skewed towards the homozygous y <dig> genotype whereas  <dig>  loci skewed towards the homozygous y <dig> genotype. the remaining  <dig> loci  skewed towards the heterozygous genotype. interestingly, dna fragments not observed in the parental lines were generated in the f <dig> hybrid plants by  <dig> ilp primers. the new bands observed in the f <dig> plants appeared in the heterozygote f <dig> plants.

inheritance of hben, ind, hind and hbut gsl contents
the f <dig> seed had similar hben, ind, hind and hbut gsl contents as the selfed female parental seed , indicating that they were controlled by the maternal genotype. the f <dig> seeds borne on f <dig> plants were classified into two groups: seeds with zero , and seeds with medium to high  hben contents, fitting well with a phenotypic ratio of  <dig> : <dig>   . this result suggested that hben gsl was controlled by one gene locus with the dominance of high over the low content. the segregation of ind gsl content fitted with a phenotypic ratio of  <dig> ): <dig> ) , and was therefore under monogenic control with the dominance of low over the high content. hind and hbut contents of the f <dig> seeds exhibited continuous distribution and could not be classified into discrete groups .

qtl analysis of erucic acid content, hben, ind, hind and hbut gsl contents
qtl analysis was performed for erucic acid content, hben, ind, hind and hbut contents . one qtl , accounting for  <dig> % of erucic content variation, was detected and co-localized with the fae <dig> gene on sal <dig> . one qtl , explaining  <dig> % of the hben content variation was assigned to sal <dig>  it was located between the two markers at3g <dig> and at2g40765a . one qtl  explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation of ind and was mapped in the region between the two markers bnappip <dig> and at3g <dig> on sal <dig>  one qtl  for hind was detected and located in the vicinity of the marker at3g <dig> on sal <dig>  which accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation. two qtls for hbut content were detected. the first qtl  accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation and was mapped to the region near the marker at2g40765a on sal <dig>  the second qtl  for hbut explained  <dig> % of the total variation and was located adjacent to the marker bnappip1011on sal <dig>  the qtls for hben, ind and hind gsl contents as well as one of the two qtls for hbut content were mapped to a terminal region on the same linkage group sal <dig> .

synteny relationships between yellow mustard and a. thaliana
ilp markers were used for comparative analysis of the linkage maps of s. alba and a. thaliana . all linkage groups of yellow mustard were chimeric in relation to a. thaliana chromosomes. sal <dig> and sal <dig> had markers of a. thaliana chromosome   <dig>  atc <dig> and atc <dig>  which corresponded to three different conserved synteny blocks. sal <dig> had four conserved blocks with two from atc <dig> and another two from atc <dig>  sal <dig> comprised  <dig> conserved blocks with three from atc <dig> and one from atc <dig>  sal <dig>  sal <dig> and sal <dig> contained markers of atc <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  which were grouped into two conserved blocks in sal <dig>  and three conserved blocks in sal <dig> and sal <dig>  sal <dig> contained a large conserved block of atc <dig> with  <dig> markers covering a genetic length of 40 cm , and one conserved block of atc <dig> . sal <dig> mainly contained marker loci of atc <dig> whereas sal <dig> had majority of markers of atc <dig>  sal <dig> was the most chimeric linkage group with marker loci from all the five a. thaliana chromosomes . sal <dig> carried three conserved blocks of atc <dig>  in addition to the conserved blocks, it was also observed that some markers of one at chromosome were scattered in a conserved block of a different at chromosome in the linkage groups of yellow mustard.

discussion
doubled haploid and highly inbred lines of yellow mustard were successfully produced in our lab. this allowed us to construct a genetic linkage map by using an f <dig> population derived from homozygote parents in this out-crossing crop species for the first time. ilp primers were designed based on the conserved exon sequence flanking the introns to exploit intron polymorphism. therefore, each ilp marker locus revealed by any particular primer would likely represent a gene copy in the genome. taking both polymorphic and monomophic loci into account,  <dig> % of the  <dig> ilp primers in the present study revealed duplicated or triplicated loci, thereby suggesting that yellow mustard is a secondary polyploidy species. this is in agreement with the previous rflp mapping results  <cit> . the twelve linkage groups most likely represented the twelve chromosomes in yellow mustard. the presence of the unmapped islands in linkage groups sal <dig> and sal <dig> could be due to the low polymorphism in the two regions between the parental lines. the possible reasons for the occurrence of distorted ilp loci could be related to the linkage of the markers with self-incompatibility and also to natural selection for the heterozygous genotypes with higher vigour than the homozygotes. distorted segregation ratio of markers were reported in linkage mapping of b. napus <cit>  and b. carinata <cit> . in the f <dig> hybrid, some ilp primer pairs generated new dna fragments that were absent in the parents, suggesting the occurrence of extensive divergence of either side of the flanking exon sequences in the parental lines. each of the two parental lines might only have flanking exon sequence complementary to either the forward or reverse primer, thereby leading to no amplification. however, the f <dig> plants derived from such two parental lines would contain flanking exon sites that could anneal with both forward and reverse primers and therefore produced a new band.

one qtl was detected for erucic content, which was in agreement with the monogenic control of this trait in previous reports  <cit> . the biosynthesis of erucic acid is controlled by the fae <dig> gene  <cit> . as expected, the qtl for erucic content co-localized with the fae <dig> gene on sal <dig>  the biosynthesis of glucosinolates occurs in the silique wall  and is then transferred to the developing seeds  <cit> . therefore, the hben, ind, hind and hbut contents were controlled by the maternal genotype. genetic studies and qtl mapping indicated that hben content was controlled by one gene locus with dominance of the high over low content as reported by drost et al.  <cit> . the two markers at3g <dig> and at2g40765a were tightly linked with the hben content and could be used for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. the allele for high hben content was linked with the allele for low ind content with a recombination frequency of  <dig> %. of the two genes for hbut, one had a recombination frequency of  <dig> % with the gene for hben on sal <dig>  and the other one was located on the linkage group sal <dig>  these results indicate that it is possible to develop new germplasm with different gsl profile in yellow mustard.

hben is an aromatic gsl produced from tyrosine. ind and hind are indole gsls derived from tryptophan, and hbut is an aliphatic gsl with methionine as the precursor  <cit> . in a. thaliana, the qtl controlling indolic gsl was not overlapped with qtl for aliphatic gsls, but the major qtl controlling the accumulation of seed benzyl gsl is linked to the gs-elong locus that controls total leaf aliphatic glucosinolates  <cit> . the present study revealed that the qtls for hben, ind, hind and one qtl of hbut were overlapped with each other at 1-lod confidence interval in sal <dig>  it remains to be investigated whether the four gsl qtls located in the same region are controlled by the same gene or due to linkage of different genes for the various gsl components in yellow mustard.

comparative synteny analysis revealed that the linkage groups of yellow mustard shared many conserved blocks with that of a. thaliana. in particular, sal <dig> and sal <dig> mainly had common marker loci with atc <dig> and atc <dig>  respectively. this suggested that sal <dig> and atc <dig> could be derived from the same ancestor chromosome while sal <dig> and atc <dig> from different one. however, it was also observed that most linkage groups of yellow mustard shared markers with over three chromosomes of a. thaliana, implying that extensive structural rearrangements such as translocations involving various chromosomes of the ancestor species and inversions had occurred during the speciation of yellow mustard. this is in agreement with the previous mapping results based on rflp markers in yellow mustard  <cit> . comparative mapping of brassica species and a. thaliana also revealed the occurrence of extensive segmental rearrangement in b. nigra <cit> , b. napus <cit> , b. juncea <cit>  and b. oleracea <cit> . the occurrence of conserved blocks between s. alba and a. thaliana would enable the genomics knowledge transfer from this model species to yellow mustard.

the current cultivars in yellow mustard are heterogeneous population varieties. with the objective to develop high yielding synthetic varieties, elite inbred lines tolerant to inbreeding have been produced by purging the deleterious alleles in each inbred generation  <cit> . characterization of the genetic diversity of different inbred lines is essential for selection of synthetic component lines with high heterotic potential. the ilp markers and constructed genetic linkage map in this study will greatly facilitate molecular assisted breeding in our yellow mustard program.

methods
plant material and production of mapping population
the quality profiles of the two parental lines y <dig> and y <dig> were shown in table  <dig>  y <dig> was the dh line samd <dig> produced at aafc-src  <cit> . it had a zero erucic content  and a zero hben content . y <dig> was produced by seven generations of inbreeding of the f <dig> plant between the variety sabre and the svalöf high oil line . it had a high erucic acid content  and a high hben content . in addition, y <dig> and y <dig> differed in ind, hind and hbut gsl contents . reciprocal crosses were made between y <dig> and y <dig> to produce the f <dig> seed. the f <dig> plants were self-pollinated to produce f <dig> seeds. one hundred fifty f <dig> plants from one f <dig> plant  were used for constructing the genetic linkage map. the parental lines, f <dig> plants and f <dig> population were grown in the greenhouse at aafc-src.

dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction 
genomic dna was extracted from young leaves of the parental, f <dig> and f <dig> plants using the modified sodium dodecyl sulfate method  <cit> . pcr for ilp markers was carried out according to javidfar and cheng  <cit> . for ssr marker analysis, the pcr mixture contained 50 ng genomic dna, 200 μm of each dntp, 1x pcr buffer,  <dig> nm of each primer and  <dig> u of taq polymerase  in a final volume of 20 μl. the pcr was performed with an initial 5 min denaturation at 94°c; 20 cycles of 30 s at 94°c, 30 s at 56°c, 45 s at 72°c; 20 cycles of 30 s at 94°c, 30 s at 47°c, 45 s at 72°c; and a final 6 min extension at 72°c. fragments were amplified with t <dig> fluorochrome- labeled primers  . pcr products were combined and analyzed on a 3130xl dna analyzer with 600liz size standard , and scored using genemapper  <dig> software .

construction of genetic linkage map and qtl analysis
the genetic linkage map was constructed by using joinmap version  <dig>  at lod scores ≥  <dig>   <cit> . recombination frequencies were converted to map distances in cm using the kosambi mapping function  <cit>  and the genetic map was drawn with mapchart  <cit> . chi-square test for goodness-of-fit was performed to determine if marker segregation deviated from the expected ratio. the threshold of p <  <dig>  was used to exclude the distorted markers from the map construction. an interval mapping analysis  <cit>  was conducted using the mapqtl  <dig>  software  <cit>  to detect qtls for erucic acid content, hben, ind, hind and hbut gsl contents. permutation test  was used to determine the significance level for lod with a genome-wide probability of p <  <dig> . an island was defined as a region with a gap of greater than 20 cm between two adjacent markers  <cit> .

comparative synteny analysis
the constructed genetic linkage map in yellow mustard was compared with the established  <dig> genomic blocks  of a. thaliana <cit> . a conserved block in the linkage map of yellow mustard was defined as a region with at least two closely linked ilp marker loci from the same block of a. thaliana.

mapping of the fae <dig> and self-compatibility genes
primer pair no  <dig> of  /pr  was designed based on the fae <dig> gene sequence of y <dig> and generated a dominant marker of 928 bp for fae <dig> gene in y <dig> , while the primer pair no  <dig> sal-srk i  was designed based on the class i s haplotype of y <dig> and produced a dominant marker of 640 bp for the self- compatibility gene in y <dig>  <cit> . the fae <dig> and self-compatibility genes were mapped to their respective linkage groups based on the segregation of the two markers in the f <dig> population of y514 × y <dig>  the pcr reaction mixture  contained 1x pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  200 μm of each dntp,  <dig>  μm of each forward and reverse primer,  <dig> u of taq polymerase  and 50 ng of genomic dna. polymerase chain reaction was performed with an initial denaturation at 94°c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94°c, 45 s at annealing temperature and 1 min at 72°c. a final extension cycle of 72°c for 5 min was conducted. all pcr products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels in 1x tae buffer. gels were visualized by staining in  <dig>  mg/l ethidium bromide and photographed on a digital gel documentation system.

erucic acid content and gsl profile assay
the erucic acid contents of the parental lines, f <dig> and f <dig> seeds were determined using the half-seed technique  <cit>  and the gas chromatographic method of thies  <cit> , except that gas chromatography of the methyl esters was performed with a hp-innowax fused silica capillary column   at 250°c using hydrogen as the carrier gas. at least  <dig> seeds of each of the parental lines and 20 f <dig> seeds were half-seed analyzed for erucic acid content. bulk samples of  <dig> self-pollinated seeds from each of the parental lines, 10 f <dig> seeds and 10 f <dig> seeds from each f <dig> plant were assayed for gsl profile using the method described by raney et al.  <cit> . benzyl gsl was isolated from the nasturtium seed in the chemistry lab at aafc-src and used as standard.

CONCLUSIONS
we have constructed a genetic linkage map with ilp and ssr markers and used it for qtl analysis of erucic acid content and glucosinolate components in yellow mustard. the markers tightly linked with the genes controlling different glucosinolate components will be used for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. the ilp markers and linkage map in this study provide useful molecular tools for yellow mustard breeding.
