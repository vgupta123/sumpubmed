BACKGROUND
the diverse group of transition metal borides comprises compounds that exhibit or combine interesting physical properties such as semiconductivity, ferromagnetism, hardness, thermal and mechanical stability and oxidation resistance  <cit> . some of the binary, ternary, and quaternary metal borides are even superconducting or represent some of the strongest permanent magnets  <cit> . because of the high melting point of boron, the traditional synthesis of metal borides does not result in nanoscale or nanostructured products. as an alternative, a room temperature synthesis of nickel boride nanoparticles via hydrolysis of nabh <dig> has been reported  <cit> . biological systems, on the other hand, can synthesise materials under mild and environmentally benign conditions  <cit> . nickel borides like ni3b, ni2b or nib are considered to exhibit catalytic activity in all kinds of reduction reactions, and hydrogenation reactions  <cit> . like iron borides they are expected to exhibit paramagnetism, ferro- or superparamagnetism  <cit> . the electrical conductivities of different nickel borides vary with their boron content. thus, the nickel-boron system represents an interesting class of compounds for a model study on peptide-boride interactions and the potential of bio-modified inorganic solids. until now nothing is known about the interaction between boron-containing materials and peptides, although peptides binding to solid surfaces have been extensively exploited for other chemical systems in nanoscale science because of their material selective properties  <cit> . to select for peptides that are capable of interacting with inorganic materials, phage peptide display is a powerful technique  <cit> . phage display is a selection technique in which a combinatorial library of random peptides  is expressed as a fusion with an m <dig> phage coat protein , resulting in the display of the fused peptide on the surface of the phage particle. selection of the desired peptides, which is usually a random 7- or 12-amino acid peptide, is achieved by multiple rounds of target binding, elution and amplification, a process known as biopanning . because the dna sequence for the displayed peptide is genetically fused to the p <dig> gene, the amino acid sequence of the phage-displayed peptide is readily obtained by sequencing the p <dig> encoding dna.

phage display has been used to identify peptides which specifically bind to metals like ag, and pd, and various inorganic materials like zno, sio <dig>  tio <dig>  zns, and cds  <cit> . in the last few years, specific binding peptides to nickel have also been described  <cit> . up to now, no specific binding peptides have been identified for borides in general, neither nanostructured nor bulk material, or more specifically nickel boride nanoparticles. the identification of such a selective binding peptide sequence would be a first, significant step towards peptide-modified boride materials and composites. such linkers would help to make boride particles available for biological systems and allow for a tuning of the properties of borides using a biological peptide-enabled nano-assembly process.

since to our knowledge no binding peptides to boride nanoparticles are described in the literature, our aim of this research was to identify peptides that bind specifically to metallic borides. this constitutes the first step in order to combine two different binding motifs e.g. a metallic and a ceramic boride into a single bifunctional phage or into a synthetic bifunctional peptide. this would be useful for the generation of new boride composite materials in which the physical properties of two different borides are unified which is until now not combinable. peptides were selected after several rounds of screening with a commercial phage library. several ni3b-binding peptides were selected using nanoparticles of amorphous and crystalline ni3b as targets. from the initial library, we identified ten phages that exhibit selective binding to either amorphous or crystalline or both using titer count analysis, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy.

RESULTS
isolation of ni3b-binding peptides
to identify ni3b-binding peptides, a commercial available m <dig> bacteriophage display library  was screened against amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles. in the ph.d.- <dig> library, random linear heptapeptides are displayed as n-terminal fusions to the minor coat protein p <dig> of m <dig>  the m <dig> phage p <dig> constructs used in the screening selection have five copies of the peptide displayed on the one end of the phage particle. five rounds of biopanning were conducted for each of the amorphous and crystalline ni3b substrates. each biopanning round involved the steps of phage binding, removal of weak binding affinity phage by washing, and elution of bound phage by a rapid ph decrease. more stringent washing conditions were used in the additional rounds of panning. a  <dig> % tbst wash solution was used to remove phage with low binding affinity to ni3b during the second round, whereas  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % tbst wash solutions were used for the third, fourth, and fifth round, respectively. a total of  <dig> phage clones were selected and analysed by dna sequencing after the fourth and fifth round of biopanning against amorphous and crystalline ni3b substrates. for amorphous ni3b substrates,  <dig> peptides were identified coding for  <dig> different peptide sequences . a summary of the peptides identified from biopanning against amorphous ni3b is provided in table  <dig>  in the case of the biopanning against crystalline ni3b substrates,  <dig> peptides were isolated coding for  <dig> different peptide sequences  shown in table  <dig>  the fact that all the peptides which were identified for crystalline ni3b are different, could be an indication of a more complex surface structure for crystalline ni3b nanoparticles than for amorphous ni3b nanoparticles. interestingly, one peptide sequence, anhqsan, termed a6/c <dig>  was isolated from both, amorphous and crystalline, ni3b substrates. while most of the peptides, especially identified for the crystalline ni3b substrate, were isolated only once, for the amorphous substrate the peptide a <dig> was isolated eight-times, a <dig> six-times, and a <dig> four-times, respectively.

characteristics of the identified binding peptides
due to the fact that cysteines interfere with the p3-mediated m <dig> infection process, no cysteines were present in the identified binding peptides  <cit> . the binding peptides showed approximately three-times more positively charged residues  than negatively charged residues  . compared with the peptides binding to amorphous ni3b, the binding peptides to crystalline nickel boride show a two-times higher occurrence of the positively charged amino acids arginine and lysine, and a three-times higher occurrence of histidine, respectively. although the distribution of charged amino acids in the library is comparable in frequency, the increased abundance of these amino acids within the identified sequences could be possibly attributed to the surface composition of the nickel borides. the characterisation of the surface of different amorphous nickel borides by okamoto et al. and caputo et al. by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy  and x-ray diffraction , respectively, revealed that the electron densities on nickel are increased by electron transfer from boron to the metal  <cit> . based on the shift of the charge, specific binding peptides could therefore interact with the nickel boride substrates via electrostatic interactions. the majority of the peptides identified on ni3b prevalently possess alanine, leucine, proline, serine and threonine residues  which is a consequence of the amino acid distribution of the applied phage display library. in addition, the binding peptides identified on amorphous ni3b possess  <dig> -times more asparagine residues as compared with the peptides identified on crystalline ni3b. this is vice versa with proline residues binding to crystalline ni3b. the strong presence of asparagine in the peptide sequences binding to amorphous ni3b, and asparagine and histidine in the peptide sequences binding to crystalline ni3b suggests that the binding between the ni3b and peptides could furthermore occur via hydrogen bonding interactions. the almost complete absence of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and methionine residues is also due to the low frequencies of these amino acids within the library. an amino acid position consensus was not evident from the 7-mer library screening of ni3b nanoparticles as substrates. however, besides the predominantly hydrophobic amino acids  and hydrophilic amino acids  the variety of amino acids with charged side groups implies that these groups could be essential in specific binding to both substrates via electrostatic interactions. the ni3b-binding peptides identified possess calculated theoretical isoelectric points  ranging from strongly acidic  to highly basic . 60% of the peptides binding to amorphous ni3b show a pi value <  <dig>  while 40% of the peptides have pi >  <dig> . 57% of the peptides binding to crystalline ni3b show a pi value <  <dig>  and 43% of the peptides have pi >  <dig> . therefore the identified peptides can be grouped into the categories acidic , neutral , and basic , respectively.

relative binding affinity experiments
because of the heterogeneity of all of the identified binding peptides and the absence of a distinctive binding motif, the binding strength of each of the  <dig> identified peptides to amorphous  and crystalline  ni3b was determined by titer assays. since previously binding affinity experiments at ph  <dig> or ph  <dig> with a subset of the identified binding peptides showed no increase in binding affinity  the relative binding affinity experiments were carried out at ph  <dig>  as a control to verify that the peptide was the interactor of interest, m13ke wild-type  phage without a random peptide insert were compared in the same manner as the peptide clones. as presented in figure 2a, most of the phage clones, except c <dig> and c <dig>  bind to amorphous ni3b with greater affinity than does the m13wt phage, which shows a binding affinity of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml with amorphous ni3b. compared with the m13wt phage,  <dig> out of  <dig> identified peptides  bound on average 100-times and  <dig> on average ten-times more efficiently to amorphous ni3b than the wild-type, verifying that binding to the substrate was a result of the peptide sequence and not due to non-specific phage coat protein interactions. the peptides a <dig>  c <dig>  and c <dig>  bound on average 1000-times more efficiently to crystalline ni3b as compared to the m13wt phage, which shows a binding affinity of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu/ml. interestingly, the phage clone a <dig> identified for amorphous ni3b shows a higher binding affinity to crystalline ni3b than most of the ni3b-binding peptides  identified for crystalline ni3b. in addition, the amorphous ni3b-binding peptides a8-a <dig> show a higher binding affinity to crystalline ni3b  than several binding peptides found for crystalline ni3b specifically . the relative binding affinity experiments revealed a set of several strong binders  for amorphous  and crystalline  substrates . the phages displaying the peptides a <dig> and c <dig> emerged as the best binders for both substrates.

competitive binding assays of the best binding peptides
the competitive binding assay represents a method to determine the most selective binding peptide sequence from a large subset of phage display results  <cit> . to identify a specifically recognised structural correlation between the surfaces of amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles, the individual phage clones of the nine strongest binders  to amorphous ni3b as determined by the relative binding affinity experiments were diluted into a single mini-phage library. the mini-phage library was then screened against amorphous or crystalline ni3b substrates. to receive better statistical results, the competitive binding assays were repeated three-times. after a single panning experiment, the strongly bound phages were isolated and a total of  <dig> phage clones were randomly selected and analysed by dna sequencing to identify the strongest binding peptides. in tables  <dig> and  <dig> the most abundant sequence indicates the strongest binding peptide to amorphous and crystalline ni3b, respectively. among the  <dig> randomly chosen plaques, the phage displaying the a <dig> peptide lgfreke has the strongest binding affinity to amorphous  and crystalline  ni3b. interestingly, the amino acids lysine, arginine, and glutamic acid were shown to have a pronounced adhesion of their charged side groups to amorphous si3n <dig> and sio <dig> under aqueous conditions  <cit> . it was also reported, that the surface of amorphous si3n <dig> may present negative sites in solution  <cit> . therefore substrates, possessing negatively surface charges in aqueous solution with ph values less than the intrinsic pka of the side chain of a basic amino acid, a peptide containing basic amino acids will be positively charged at these groups and will provide an attractive interaction to the given surface  <cit> . in aqueous solutions with higher ph values than the intrinsic pka of the side chain of an acidic amino acid, a peptide containing acidic amino acids will be negatively charged at these groups. based on these facts, the best binder a <dig>  possesses in solution at ph  <dig> an alternating series of positively and negatively charged side chains in its peptide sequence which could be responsible for an interaction between the charge depleted boron and the electrons accumulated on the nickel side of amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles. in contrast, the 7-mer peptide sequence tnltlas, termed a <dig>  which emerged as the dominant amorphous ni3b binder in the initial screening, possesses no charged side chain. the lack of electrostatic interactions might contribute to the observed fact, that it does not show the highest frequency in the competitive assay.

fluorescence microscopy of ni3b-m <dig> complex
the binding of phage displaying the a <dig> peptide lgfreke to amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. amplified phage displaying the lgfreke peptide were incubated either with amorphous or crystalline ni3b nanoparticles and then washed to remove the nonspecifically bound phage particles. the samples were then dyed using a fluorescently tagged anti-m <dig> monoclonal antibody and washed again to eliminate nonspecifically bound anti-m <dig> antibodies. the fluorescence confocal images in figure 3a and c show the lgfreke displaying phage binding to the surface of amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles, respectively. considerable fluorescence emits from the surfaces of the lgfreke phage-ni3b nanoparticles. although the relative binding affinity experiments showed an unspecific binding of the wild-type phage to the ni3b substrates, the control experiments  showed no fluorescence. this could be due to the fact that the concentration of bound phage is below the detection limit.

afm measurements
to verify the interaction between m <dig> phage displaying the a <dig> peptide on the p <dig> coat protein and ni3b particles, afm measurements of phage bound to amorphous and crystalline ni3b particles were carried out . the modified m <dig> phage were incubated either with amorphous or crystalline nanoparticles as shown in figure 4a and b, respectively. as shown in figure 4a and b the height of the colour scale exceeds the height of the particles. this colour scale was chosen to show the 100-nm-thick particles together with the 6-nm-thick phage. individual phage are approximately 1 μm in length and  <dig>  nm in height. this cross section and length of the modified phage correspond to that of m <dig> wt phage . some phage were oriented with their ends towards a nanoparticle , which implies an affinity between the modified phage proteins and the particle. there are a few particles that seem to be attached to the unmodified side of the phage. possible explanations for this observation include unspecific interaction or the presence of more than one phage, i.e. bundles of phage where the end of one phage coincides with the side of another phage. a small level of unspecific interaction between nanoparticles and phage cannot be avoided during preparation for afm imaging. the phage oriented with their ends towards the nanoparticles, suggest that the peptide lgfreke interacts with both amorphous and crystalline ni3b nanoparticles.

CONCLUSIONS
metal borides are inorganic solids that are very interesting due to their high versatility in physical properties, as for example magnetism, electrical and thermal conductivity, hardness and catalytic activity, but at the same time they are difficult to prepare. besides the application as catalysts in all kinds of reduction reactions, and hydrogenation reactions, metallic borides are employed for the generation of conductive ceramics, hard magnets, superconductors, and hard materials  <cit> . typical synthesis routes employ high reaction temperatures and do not allow for a directed synthesis of particles that are well-defined in terms of size, shape, uniformity, phase purity, or crystallinity. formation of metal boride nanoparticles in solvents has been described occasionally, but an interaction of borides with biological material or bio-molecules like peptides was unknown before  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to identify peptides that bind specifically to amorphous and to crystalline ni3b nanoparticles. although all identified peptide sequences showed no significant binding motif, the analysis of the resulting ni3b-binding sequences found them to be enriched in charged amino acids. the identified binding sequences possessed approximately three times more positively charged than negatively charged amino acids which leads to the assumption of electrostatic interactions between the identified binding peptides and the ni3b substrates. fluorescence microscopy and afm studies directly confirmed the adhesion of the best binding phage displaying the peptide lgfreke to amorphous and crystalline ni3b particles. the best binding peptide sequence could play an important role for the development of a new synthesis route of ni3b in the presence of phage displaying the peptide, or the synthetic peptide, respectively, which would represent a complete new approach. the synthesis of ni3b in the presence of lgfreke could result in mono-disperse and peptide capped nanoparticles with well-defined and uniform sizes and shapes exhibiting new catalytic and magnetic properties. furthermore, the utilisation of m <dig> phage as template for the ni3b mineralisation could potentially serve as a viable alternative to create tailor-made boride composite materials by a biologically driven nano-assembly synthesis and structuring for the generation of thermoelectric devices and field effect transistors.
