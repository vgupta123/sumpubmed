BACKGROUND
global climatic oscillations have profoundly influenced species’ distributions and their genetic traits  <cit> , and as such, the impact has been the focus of a number of european and north america studies  <cit> . the affects of environmental change associated with pleistocene climatic oscillations on the evolutionary history and genetic structure of many species in east asia have also been documented  <cit> . it is important to highlight that the extensive glacial advance that occurred in europe and north america during the pleistocene did not occur in china, as numerous monsoons throughout the period acted as a preventative  <cit> . consequently, china was never completely covered by continental ice during the multiple episodes of glaciation in the last  <dig>  million years  <cit> . the complicated topographical condition and the change of local/regional climate in china was mostly a direct result of the tibetan plateau uplift, rather than extensive glaciation  <cit> . thus, most of china had a relatively mild climate during the pleistocene  <cit> .

in the context of complex regional conditions in china, studies on animal geographic distribution patterns have provided information on the evolutionary histories following the global pleistocene climate changes  <cit> . using such studies it is possible to compare the affects of climate changes during the pleistocene on evolutionary history to regions of similar latitude  <cit> . previous studies suggested that colonization events, dispersal patterns and migratory behaviors play a crucial role in determining a species’ geographical range and demographic history  <cit> . in addition, both historical events and ecological factors also influence extant species genetic diversity and population structure  <cit> . ice-age refugia, which provide a chance of surviving for species, have been proposed to been present in the southeast china hills region, sichuan basin region and yunnan region, however this still remains controversial. some studies have shown that cold condition forced species below 25° n in eastern china  <cit> . others have argued that a decrease in temperature would have reduced the overall species range, but that a range of relatively stable mountain microclimates would have allowed species to persist over much of their range  <cit> . research on the phylogeography of chinese flora and fauna during the pleistocene has been limited, with many species remaining unexplored including non-sedentary bats.

bats are the second largest order of mammals, and are important biological indicators as they are sensitive to both climate and environmental changes  <cit> . previous studies have revealed that the demographic history and current geographical distribution of many bats were influenced by ancient climatic changes  <cit> . in mainland china, population genetic structure can often be explained by the influence of local geographical structure. all previous studies on chinese bats have shown that subpopulations originally existed in eastern china  <cit> . however, with differences among geographical structure, multiple subpopulations in the mountains of southern china region  have also been documented  <cit> . for example, two subpopulations existed in this region for myotis davidii; one in the yungui plateau region and the other in the southeast china hills region  <cit> . a similar trend was noted for hipposideros armiger by lin and colleagues  <cit> , who noted four subpopulations of h. armiger in this region. these studies have illustrated that the population genetic structure of bats is consistent with this region’s geographical structure. as the dispersal of most bat species is male-biased, examining the maternally inherited mitochondrial dna  along with microsatellites can provide insights into genetic population structure.  <cit> .

there are three dominant fish-eating bat species found globally: the greater bulldog bat  and the mexican fishing bat , mostly found in the new world tropics, as well as the rickett’s big-footed bat , exclusively distributed in the old world temperate regions  <cit> . in china, m. pilosus is abundant and mainly distributed in north china plain  region, southeast china hills  region, yungui plateau  region, sichuan basin  region and yangtze plain  region . a single fish species, zacco platypus, makes up 60% of the diet for m. pilosus <cit> . importantly, m. pilosus has been listed as a “near threatened” species by the international union for conservation of nature   <cit> .

considering that bats are good model organisms for assessing environmental and climatic changes, and that during the pleistocene china did not experience extreme glaciation, we explored the phylogeography of m. pilosus using both mtdna and microsatellite markers to address some questions: 1) were population divergence and expansion events of m. pilosus related to pleistocene climate change? 2) did glacial refugia exist in eastern china during the pleistocene? 3) were the spatial distribution of mtdna lineages of m. pilosus consistent with the geographical structure? and 4) did mtdna and microsatellite markers provide the same genetic structure patterns for m. pilosus?

RESULTS
sequence characteristics and genetic diversity
the mitochondrial control region varied in length  as a result of a 81 bp repeat . for consistency, only the first repeat  was included in subsequent analyses, given a total length of 442 bp. in total, we identified  <dig> haplotypes from the  <dig> sequences. forty-three polymorphic sites and three insertions or deletions  were observed. fifteen haplotypes of these  were unique within a single population. four haplotypes  were shared by populations within the same geographical unit. two haplotypes were shared by different geographical units: hap  <dig> was shared by sc <dig> from scb region and hen from ytp region; and hap  <dig> was shared by ncp region  and ytp region  . all haplotypes were submitted to genbank .

the overall haplotype diversity  was  <dig> , and the overall nucleotide diversity  was  <dig> . the microsatellite analysis showed expected heterozygosities  ranged from  <dig>  for sc <dig> to  <dig>  for jx <dig>  and observed heterozygosity  ranged from  <dig>  for sc <dig> to  <dig>  for yn <dig>  allelic diversity  was  <dig>  . no consistent departure from hwe or signs of linkage disequilibrium was detected , and the mean frequencies of null alleles for each locus were low . the analysis showed that our dataset had high power  of detecting population structure even at a low level of genetic differentiation , and α error was less to 5% in all cases.

phylogenetics
neighbor-joining , maximum likelihood , and bayesian  analysis recovered identical topologies. the phylogenetic trees recovered monophyly of the whole m. pilosus population and assigned all the haplotypes into three main phylogenetic lineages: clade a , clade b  and clade c  . clade a included the most individuals from ytp region  and four individuals from sd <dig> and sd <dig>  clade b was restricted to all individuals from sc <dig>  but there was however one individual from hen. clade c was comprised of mostly specimens from ygp region, sch region and ncp region . the tcs analysis of the mtdna data produced three independent networks  .

for mtdna results, amova revealed significant genetic variance for all three hierarchical levels examined , and strong population structure with  <dig> % of the genetic variation found among regions. the microsatellite data however showed weak population structure, with  <dig> % of the variation coming from within a population .

statistically significant results were indicated by asterisks: **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> .

the structure result at k =  <dig> provided the best separation and delta k value . however, individuals from the same population were recovered with multiple groups based on microsatellite data, indicating a mixed population structure. similar results were also found when k = 3– <dig>  most of the individuals from yn <dig>  yn <dig>  bj, sd <dig> and sd <dig> were assigned to a cluster, and individuals from jx <dig>  hun, sc <dig>  sc <dig>  ah, zj and jx <dig> were assigned to a separate cluster. no marked groups were identified when k >  <dig> .

individual assignment tests indicated that only a small proportion of individuals of m. pilosus  were assigned to the populations from which they were sampled; instead most individuals  were assigned to other populations. among the three genetic lineages identified from the mtdna data,  <dig>  of the individuals from clade a,  <dig>  from clade b,  <dig>  from clade c, were assigned to other genetic lineages.

the overall fst value of mtdna was  <dig>  . only  <dig> % of the pairwise fst values were not significant  in the whole population, suggesting the existence of significant population differentiation in m. pilosus . for microsatellite analysis, the overall fst value was  <dig>  . up to  <dig> % of pairwise fst were not significant  in the whole population, and nm values suggested more gene flow in microsatellite data than in mtdna . a mantel test indicated that mtdna failed to support isolation-by-distance  model , however, microsatellite marker fitted an ibd model .

discussion
demographic history and expansion events
the glacial refugium hypothesis and the expansion-contraction model predict that long-term isolation of populations within geographically separate refugia will lead to spatially distinct genetic lineages during the pleistocene  <cit> . in our study, the results of phylogenetic and median-joining network analyses identified three deeply split lineages of m. pilosus in mainland china, arisen due to the presence of multiple glacial refugia during the pleistocene. the most recent common ancestor of these m. pilosus populations is likely to have originated in the yangtze plains region, as high genetic diversity and ancient haplotypes, and tmrca could date back to  <dig>  myr bp . at this time, mainland china had just concluded the second stage of penultimate glaciation . thus the yangtze plains region was likely to be a glacial refuge, supporting our hypothesis that such refugia existed in eastern china during the pleistocene. other studies have also confirmed that mountainous areas of this region had relatively stable climatic conditions during the pleistocene glaciation, providing probable glacial refugia for many species  <cit> . our study identifies that intra-specific divergence within m. pilosus first occurred in  <dig> - <dig>  myr bp , which corresponds to a relatively warm interglacial period in mainland china  <cit> . it is possible that the intra-specific divergence noted among m. pilosus during this time is a direct result of geographic isolation, resulting from spread of individuals from the ytp region to other regions. the second divergence, clade b and clade c in figure  <dig>  is dated at  <dig> - <dig>  myr bp, and is likely associated with increased cold conditions during the third phase of the penultimate glaciation   <cit> . it is possible that many individuals were able to survive these cold conditions in different but isolated shelters found in distinct refugia. according to our mtdna results, refugia for clade c may be located in sch region, which had the highest haplotype and nucleotide diversity . this region has previously been identified as a refuge during the penultimate glaciation, for organisms including m. davidii <cit> , rhinolophus ferrumequinum <cit> . unfortunately, it is not possible to infer the refuge location for clade b. overall, our results indicate that population divergences of m. pilosus were related to the pleistocene climatic changes.

in addition to mediating the population divergence of m. pilosus, we hypothesized that the pleistocene climate changes also affected population expansion events. the population expansion tests conducted indicated that the population expansion for clade c occurred around  <dig>  years bp, which correlates to one of the warmest periods during the last glaciation  <cit> . from our results we were also able to infer that other rapid expansion events occurred from  <dig>  to  <dig>  years bp for scb region, ncp region and ygp region . this time frame is associated with the end of the last glacial age, where climatic conditions were suitable for population growth. expansion during this time was plausible and has been documented for a range of species  <cit> . these results indicate that the current populations of m. pilosus for those regions were derived recently, providing an explanation as to the low genetic diversity in the three geographic units  <cit> . we also detected several overlap points among divergent mtdna lineages. for example, the hen population comprises haplotypes of clade a and b, and sd <dig> and sd <dig> population includes haplotypes of clade a and c. this overlap could have occurred as a result of a second contact caused by recent population dispersal, or incomplete lineage sorting. it is worth mentioning that although the mtdna revealed the population history of m. pilosus, it does have its limitations  <cit> . therefore, we expect that when mtdna is combined with nuclear dna data in future studies, a more well supported and informative demographic history will be obtained.

population structure
as previously mentioned, the mtdna data identified that individuals from all populations were grouped into three distinct genetic lineages : yangtze plain lineage , sichuan basin lineage  and north and south of china lineage . these population genetic structures were also supported by the results of an amova with  <dig> % variation among regions . population genetic structure was generally consistent with the known macro-ecological characteristics, with individuals from populations with similar vegetation types, temperature, precipitation and topography recovered in the same lineage  <cit> . the pattern of subdivision into subpopulations could be explained by the influence of environmental characteristics during an extended period of time, and especially be reflected in mtdna. we observed that different lineages were located in different geographic regions, such as ytp region for clade a and scb region for clade b. consistency between population genetic structure and environmental characteristics also existed for other bats species across this same region, such as m. davidii <cit>  and r. ferrumequinum <cit> . however, the population genetic structure of m. pilosus was incomplete consistent with other bats. interestingly, other studies of chinese bats which focused on populations from the southern mountains of china , revealed 2– <dig> distinct lineages  <cit> . in this study we only identified a single genetic lineage of m. pilosus , which included individuals from the ncp region and the southern mountains of china region  . this genetic structure difference between m. pilosus and other bats species might be explained by differences in the number of refugia. in this geographic region, m. pilosus survived in a single glacial shelter , while other bats species likely survived in multiple refugia, allowing for a greater number of genetic lineages  <cit> .

the results of genetic differentiation  revealed strong population genetic structure in the mtdna data; however, similar analyses based on microsatellite showed weak population genetic structure . the different levels of genetic structure in mtdna and microsatellite may be explained in part by the different divergent mutation rates and/or the effective population size of the maternally and bi-parentally inherited markers  <cit> . however, we hypothesized that different level of genetic structure between these two data types may be largely ascribed to sex-biased gene flow. there were three possible explanations that led us to this conclusion. firstly, we observed contrasting patterns of genetic structure among the two markers. both phylogenetic trees and median-joining network of mtdna grouped a number of populations, including jx <dig>  hun, sd <dig>  sd <dig>  yn <dig>  yn <dig> and sc <dig> grouped into clade c, while clade b only comprised of a single population . however, the structure analysis based on microsatellite showed that m. pilosus individuals classified three distinct lineages, clade a , clade b , and clade c  by mtdna, but were recovered as a single cluster using microsatellite data . secondly, only the microsatellite data fit the ibd model from the mantel test . it is possible that the mtdna did not support this ibd model as gene flow even among populations, even those separated by short geographic distances, may have been limited  <cit> . for example, population jx <dig> is geographically close to jx <dig> , however, based on mtdna, they belong to two distinct lineages  . thus, in spite of having no geographical boundaries to prevent gene flow, it did not occur. this phenomenon also observed among other populations, such as jx <dig> vs jx <dig>  hun vs jx <dig>  hun vs jx <dig>  sc <dig> vs sc <dig> . contrastingly, the analysis of ibd based on the microsatellite data showed a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and geographical distance, indicating gene flow between nuclear lineages. gene flow among populations using the microsatellite data was supported by the low overall pairwise fst, mostly non-significant pairwise genetic differences among populations along with a high nm . the lack of ibd with mtdna was probably due to female philopatry, as the gene flow between populations was likely mediated by males. finally, individual assignment tests also indicated frequent migrations among three mtdna lineages. combining these results, this study has revealed different genetic variation patterns between mtdna and microsatellite markers, which may have resulted from the male-biased dispersal. this dispersal pattern has also been documented in other bat species, e.g., eptesicus fuscus <cit> , m. bechsteinii <cit> , m. bechsteinii <cit> , m. myotis <cit> , m. punicus <cit> , nyctalus noctula <cit> , r. monoceros <cit> , r. ferrumequinum <cit> . we inferred that in breeding avoidance is likely to be the crucial factor driving male dispersal in this species  <cit> .

conservation implications
myotis pilosus is the only of the three major fish-eating bats that has an asian or old world distribution. due to the specialized diet of m. pilosus, it may be highly susceptible to the lack of food resources common when habitats are destroyed  <cit> . genetically divergent populations and their surrounding environments have been recognized in the literature as conservation priorites  <cit> . based on this and the mtdna results obtained in this study, ytp, scb and nsc regions represent areas of conservation importance . for these regions, we suggest that appropriate measures be taken to preserve their genetic uniqueness. moreover, based on genetic data, the priority for conservation should be given to sch region with highest genetic diversity and overlap zones  with multiple lineages. protection of both regions populations will protect the majority of diversity and lineages of m. pilosus.

CONCLUSIONS
our research has indicated that several populations of m. pilosus, which are distributed throughout mainland china, are monophyletic and have a single common ancestor . population dispersal, genetic divergence and expansion events of m. pilosus in china are likely to be associated with pleistocene climate fluctuations. both the yangtze plain region and southeast china hill region may have provided shelters for the survival of individuals during cold glaciation. the degree of genetic differentiation, based on the analysis of mtdna and microsatellite of m. pilosus, suggested a male-mediated gene flow among populations. overall conservation attention should be given to the areas highlighted in this study, which corresponds to regions with high genetic diversity and population overlap zones.
