BACKGROUND
genetic differences between individuals are encoded as local changes consisting of substitutions and small indels that alter a few base pairs, and large-scale changes that consist of larger indels, rearrangements and copy number variations. whole genome sequencing using ngs technologies offers a unique opportunity to study these variations and enable a better understanding of genome function and diversity. there are a number of mature software packages and associated pipelines that can identify single nucleotide polymorphisms  with a high degree of concordance  <cit> . however, the same cannot be said for tools that are used to identify the other sources of variation.

indels are the most common structural variant that contribute to pathogenesis of disease  <cit> , gene expression and functionality. current approaches to identify indels include de-novo assembly of unaligned reads  <cit> , read splitting  <cit> , depth of coverage analysis  <cit>  and analysis of insert size inconsistencies. each of these approaches has their own strengths and weaknesses. for example, even though de-novo assembly offers the best opportunity to accurately call these variants, assembly with short reads is a challenging problem that requires significant computational resources. similarly split-read approaches perform with a high degree of accuracy for short and medium sized indels, but the false-negative rate increases significantly with increase in size of the variations. paired-end read and depth of coverage approaches frequently miss small indels, and are unable to predict the breakpoints accurately. we believe a hybrid strategy that integrates the information using more than one of the above approaches is required to identify these indels with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.

here we present indelminer, a method that uses a combination of split-read and paired-end approaches to identify the breakpoints of insertions and deletions. the identified indels can be annotated with additional information such as the depth of coverage across the predicted breakpoints, and the list can be subsequently filtered to generate a high quality subset of variants. in addition to identification of indels, indelminer can also be used to investigate the absence or presence of support for a set of indels in another sample. this is valuable in investigation of normal/tumor pairs as well in cases where several individuals of a family are sequenced to identify de-novo changes in the proband, and a novel feature of indelminer. we present the results of using indelminer on simulated data as well as real data from the individual na <dig> and a cancer genome dataset. we compare the performance and results of indelminer to previously published results from several other similar tools.

RESULTS
simulated dataset
in order to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of our method, and compare it to that of a few other popular tools, we implanted  <dig>  known homozygous deletions, and  <dig>  known homozygous insertions  <cit>  into chromosome  <dig> of the human genome.  <dig> bp long paired-end  illumina reads were simulated from this modified sequence using pirs  <cit> , such that each nucleotide on the reference was covered  <dig> times on an average. the reads were mapped to the human reference chromosome  <dig> using bwa  <cit>  version  <dig> . <dig>  with the default parameters. the resulting bam file was sorted based on the chromosomal coordinates, and the reads were realigned around putative indels using indelrealigner tool from the gatk suite  <cit> .

we ran samtools  <cit> , pindel  <cit> , prism  <cit>  and indelminer on this dataset and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  the indels identified by the tools were compared to the true set, and in case of deletions a call was marked as validated if there was a reciprocal overlap with at least half of the actual deletion. the details of the arguments and parameters used for this experiment are detailed in the additional file  <dig>  samtools exhibits the lowest false-positive rate for this dataset , but its false-negative rate is significantly higher when compared to the other software. out of the remaining tools, indelminer exhibits the lowest false-positive rate  as well a false-negative rate that is significantly lower than pindel , and comparable to that of prism .table  <dig>

real dataset
we used about 28-fold data corresponding to the yoruban hapmap individual na <dig>  to evaluate indelminer on real data. the same sample has been characterized in multiple studies  <cit>  and sequenced using multiple platforms  <cit> , making it an ideal test case to compare the results of indelminer. we downloaded the fastq reads for the hapmap individual from the short read archive . these 101 bp reads were generated using the standard illumina paired-end library protocol, with an average insert length of about 500 bps. we aligned these reads to the hg <dig> reference sequence using bwa version  <dig> . <dig> with the default parameters except -q  <dig>  which was used to trim the low quality segment of the read down to 35 bps at the 3’ end. the reads around putative indels were realigned using gatk indelrealigner, followed by use of markduplicates  to flag the potential pcr duplicates. the resulting bam file was used to identify indels using samtools, pindel, prism and indelminer .

for the na <dig> genome, indelminer detected  <dig>  indels . additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the length distribution of the identified indels and additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows their distribution across the human chromosomes, which correlates well to the amount of dna present in the chromosomes.  <dig> of the identified indels overlap with the protein coding exons corresponding to the set of refseq  <cit>  genes.  <dig> % of these coding indels are of lengths that are a multiple of  <dig>  this is in close concordance with previous studies  <cit>  that have reported that in-frame indels should constitute about 50%-60% of all coding indels.  <dig>   of these indels identified using indelminer were also found in dbsnp version  <dig> and  <dig>   of them were found in the database of genomic variants .  <dig>   of the variants were also identified in the phase  <dig> release  <dig> of the  <dig> genomes project in african samples.

we also compared the variants identified using indelminer to those identified using samtools, pindel and prism. figure  <dig> shows a comparison of the variants called by the various tools using the same read alignments. two calls were marked as an overlap if they had a reciprocal overlap greater than 50% of the breakpoint range. all of the included software agreed on  <dig>  of the indels, whereas about  <dig>  of the indels were supported by at least two of the software we looked at as part of this study.figure  <dig>

cancer normal/tumor pair
all cancers arise as a result of accumulation of mutations that confer growth advantage. the advent of next-generation sequencing provides a powerful and cost-effective tool to characterize these genome-wide changes. the primary tumor tissue and adjacent or distal normal tissue are frequently sequenced and analyzed to identify germline and rare somatic mutations. the first step in such an analysis is to identify the mutations that are unique to the cancer. issues such as normal dna contamination of tumor dna complicate the analysis by reducing the tumor variant allele frequency.

large granular lymphocyte  leukemia is characterized by a clonal expansion of either cd3+ cytotoxic t or cd3− nk cells, and is frequently associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  <cit> . a patient was consented under institutional review board protocols initiated at the pennsylvania state university and continuing at the university of virginia in accordance with the declaration of helsinki. the patient consented to inclusion in an lgl leukemia patient registry which permits the publication of de-identified patient characteristics and an additional addendum consenting to next generation sequencing and the public deposition of data derived therefrom. we sequenced the peripheral blood and matched saliva from a patient diagnosed with lgl, to a coverage of 29-fold and 17-fold respectively . we used indelminer to  identify indels in the blood sample and  investigate and tag those indels based on their presence or absence in the matched saliva sample. indelminer identified  <dig>  indels in the blood sample, out of which  <dig>  of them were also observed in the saliva. indelocator  has been used in earlier studies  <cit>  to identify indels in normal/tumor pairs. we used indelocator on the same dataset, and it identified  <dig>  indels in the blood sample,  <dig>  of which were also observed in the matching normal sample. we found that  <dig>   of the indels found by indelocator were also found by indelminer, whereas the remaining indels were observed by only one of the two software tools. we randomly selected  <dig> indels that were identified by indelminer but not identified by indelocator for validation . we were not able to design a reliable pair of primers for  <dig> of the indels due to their location in low-complexity regions or repeat regions in the human genome.  <dig> of the remaining  <dig> indels were validated using sanger sequencing, including a large deletion spanning  <dig> bases .figure  <dig>

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
recent studies have reported on the concordance of single-nucleotide variants identified using different software tools  <cit>  as well using different sequencing platforms  <cit> . the fraction of polymorphic sites where all platforms/tools agree varies between 70-90% for the snp calls. often the overlap of predicted indels between different methods is much lower, indicating that none of the methods offer a comprehensive satisfactory solution.

indelminer uses a combination of approaches to identify indels of arbitrary size from paired-end short reads. it can predict the exact breakpoint for small and medium size indels, and the approximate breakpoints for the larger deletions. the performance of the algorithm degrades in regions where a single short-read covers multiple indels, as well as in regions where the mapping quality of the sequences is low. a de novo assembly approach has been shown to be more suitable in a large fraction of such regions. the current version of indelminer can only handle indels; however the same algorithm can be extended to handle other types of structural variants, in a manner similar to pindel and prism. we do not use sequences where both reads from the same fragment align with a mapping quality of zero, i.e., cases where neither of the mates can be aligned unambiguously in finding the indels. if one of the reads can be aligned unambiguously, then indelminer can use that information to split and align the second read. as explained earlier, we do use such sequences that align ambiguously in the mode where we are just looking to tag the presence or absence of a variant. when tagging the presence or absence of indels in sample b indelminer uses all the alignments including the secondary alignments to check against the indels found in sample a.

we used both simulated and real data to show that indelminer has low false-positives and a low false-negative rate when compared to several other tools in the same category. indelminer can also be used in study of normal/tumor pairs, and in studies where multiple individuals from the same family are being sequenced. the pcr validations confirm the accuracy and sensitivity of indelminer, and its ability to identify indels in high-throughput sequencing datasets.
