BACKGROUND
the hallmark of positive-strand rna viruses is their ability to recruit distinct host-cell organelle membranes in order to create unique compartments at which viral rna replication takes place  <cit> . this process is exemplified during tombusvirus infections of plant cells where, depending on the virus and host, peroxisomes or mitochondria undergo a series of remarkable structural rearrangements that ultimately results in their transformation into so-called multivesicular bodies  . these novel structures form initially by the proliferation and progressive invagination of the organelle's boundary  membrane, resulting in the matrix or intermembrane space containing hundreds of small  vesicles and/or spherules which serve as the sites of viral rna replication. mvbs often then form one or more large, vesicle/spherule-containing appendages that encircle portions of the neighbouring cytosol, yielding c-shaped or doughnut-shaped structures that frequently coalesce with other mvbs in the infected cell.

while the cytolopathological features of mvb biogenesis have been relatively well studied, many fundamental questions remain about the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of viral replication factors with host-cell membranes. for instance, the significance of the diversity of intracellular membranes used by different viruses is unknown. likewise, the events involved in the specific intracellular targeting and membrane integration/assembly of the viral replication proteins, as well as the host-cell factors that facilitate these processes and/or mediate membrane remodelling are, in most cases, poorly studied and unclear.

cirv is a member of the tombusviridae family of positive-strand rna plant viruses that include cymbidium ringspot virus  and the tomato bushy stunt virus   <cit> . similar to other tombusviruses, the cirv genome consists of a  <dig> -kb linear, monopartite rna molecule that contains five open reading frames   <cit> , including orf <dig> and orf <dig>  a 36-kd rna-binding protein  and its translation read-through product, a 95-kd rna-dependent rna polymerase . both p <dig> and p <dig> are the integral membrane-bound components of the virus' rna replication complex and are located within the virus-induced vesicles/spherules of the mvb  <cit> . the remaining three orfs in the cirv genome encode a 41-kd coat protein, a 22-kd protein required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus, and a 19-kd protein that functions as a suppressor of virus-induced gene silencing  <cit> .

in cirv-infected cells, mvbs are derived from mitochondria  <cit>  and the principal viral component involved in this process appears to be p <dig>  for instance, analysis of full-length hybrid infectious clones of cirv and cymrsv, which, unlike cirv, recruits peroxisomes for its viral rna replication, revealed that both of their orf1s, namely p <dig> and the cymrsv 33-kd membrane-bound replication protein , contain the determinants for the formation of mvbs derived from mitochondria or peroxisomes, respectively  <cit> . p <dig> expressed alone in either tobacco mesophyll or in yeast  cells is also sufficient to target the green fluorescent protein  to mitochondria and while these organelles are not entirely transformed into mvbs, they displayed dramatic alterations in their distribution and morphology, including proliferation of their outer membranes  <cit> . interestingly, results from previous studies of p <dig> suggest also that its sorting to mitochondrial outer membranes is atypical since it does not appear to rely on mitochondrial-surface proteinaceous receptors nor a targeting/insertion signal similar to those typically found in most host-cell mitochondrial membrane- or matrix-localized proteins  <cit> . the nature of the sorting pathway for p <dig>  instead, is considered to be complex, consisting of multiple, perhaps novel, targeting/insertion signals and a unique membrane insertion mechanism  <cit> , however, this premise has not been experimentally tested.

here, we describe the results of a comprehensive study of the molecular signals involved in the mitochondrial targeting of p <dig>  we show using a combination of p36-reporter fusion proteins and p36-p <dig> hybrid proteins, wherein specific regions of p <dig> were replaced with those that constitute the peroxisomal targeting information in p <dig> , that the mitochondrial sorting of p <dig> is mediated by an internal targeting signal consisting of its two moderately hydrophobic tmds and a positively-charged face of an amphipathic helix located within the intervening loop sequence. notably, this targeting signal in p <dig> resembles the targeting determinants in several authentic mitochondrial outer membrane proteins from evolutionarily diverse organisms. we show also that p <dig> interacts with certain components of the translocase in the mitochondrial outer membrane , but not with the sorting and assembly machinery , in a manner consistent with the insertion of some host-cell mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. the implications of these findings in terms of cirv's and other positive-strand rna viruses' strategies to appropriate and subsequently modify mitochondrial sorting pathways to their own advantage are briefly discussed. also discussed is how these results provide insight to the cellular processes underlying plant mitochondrial outer membrane protein sorting in general.

RESULTS
p <dig> expressed transiently in tobacco by- <dig> cells is localized to mitochondrial outer membranes
to begin to decipher the intracellular targeting information within p <dig>  we took advantage of tobacco  bright yellow- <dig>  suspension-cultured cells as a well-characterized in vivo import system  <cit> . specifically, by- <dig> cells were transiently transformed  with plasmid dna encoding p <dig> fused at either its n or c terminus to the myc-epitope recognition motif  and, then, following a  <dig> h incubation period to allow for gene expression and protein sorting, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence confocal-laser scanning microscopy . as shown in figure  <dig>  both transiently-expressed myc-p <dig> and p36-myc localized exclusively to globular structures that were found mostly within the perinuclear region of the cell and contained endogenous e1β, a protein subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex located in the mitochondrial matrix  <cit> . interestingly, close inspection of these p36-containing globular structures at higher magnification revealed that they actually consisted of numerous torus or donut-shaped structures that contained myc-p <dig> or p36-myc and that enclosed spherical fluorescent structures containing matrix-localized e1β . these toroidal structures also contained the endogenous mitochondrial outer membrane protein porin  <cit> , as evidenced by the colocalization of p36-myc and porin . taken together, these results indicate that p <dig> sorts to mitochondrial outer membranes in by- <dig> cells and that the expression of this viral protein causes mitochondria to coalesce in perinuclear regions, in contrast to mitochondria in non-transformed cells that are distributed throughout the cytosol; refer to images of the immunostaining of endogenous mitochondrial porin and e1β in the non-transformed cells shown in the bottom row of figure  <dig> 

while it remains to be determined whether the aggregated mitochondria in p36-transformed cells were modified also in terms of their ultrastructure, this possibility is likely since expression of p <dig>  in various other cell types  led to similar aggregations of mitochondria, as well as a proliferation of their outer membranes  <cit> . indeed, high-magnified views of myc-p36- or p36-myc-transformed by- <dig> cells in this study revealed that the immunostaining pattern attributable to endogenous porin in these cells was more diffuse than that observed in non-transformed cells , suggesting that the outer mitochondrial membranes in the former cells were altered in terms of their morphology. the nature of these changes or the mechanism by which p <dig> participates in this process were not, however, examined further.

the localization of myc-p <dig> and p36-myc to mitochondria indicates also that appending the myc epitope to the n or c terminus of p <dig> did not disrupt the protein's normal targeting behaviour, since non-tagged  p <dig> colocalized also with endogenous porin in the outer membranes of aggregated mitochondria . p <dig> was immunodetected in these cells using polyclonal antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to an amino acid sequence in the c-terminal half of tbsv p <dig> and p <dig> replicase proteins  and conserved in cirv p <dig> and p <dig> . however, due to limited availability of this antibody reagent, only myc-tagged versions of p <dig>  primarily p36-myc, were employed in the remainder of the experiments described in this manuscript.

the localization of epitope-tagged and wild-type p <dig> to mitochondrial outer membranes, and their subsequent effects on mitochondrial morphology and distribution, were similar also to when p <dig> was co-expressed with its allied replication protein, p <dig>  either together alone  or together in the context of full-length cirv, i.e., a cirv cdna positioned within a plant expression plasmid . confirmation of the infectivity of this cirv cdna was that chenopodium quinoa leaves  <dig> to  <dig> days after rub-inoculation displayed local lesions  that resembled the disease symptoms reported for leaves infected with native cirv rna  <cit> . moreover, electron microscopic analyses of these cirv cdna-inoculated leaf samples revealed the presence of mitochondrial-derived mvbs that were not observed in cells from mock-transformed leaves . the results for the mitochondrial localization of p <dig> expressed in the context of full-length cirv  are important because they indicate that, compared to the expression of p <dig> alone , the viral protein behaves in a similar manner in terms of its intracellular localization. thus, we deemed it appropriate to study the mitochondrial targeting information of p <dig> when expressed on its own.

p <dig> is orientated in mitochondrial outer membranes in an nout-cout topology
the topological orientation of p <dig> in mitochondrial outer membranes was assessed using a differential detergent permeabilization assay  <cit> . specifically, by- <dig> cells were transformed transiently with n- or c-terminal myc-tagged versions of p <dig> and then fixed and incubated either with triton x- <dig>  which perforates all cellular membranes, or with digitonin, which perforates only the plasma membrane.

as shown in figure  <dig> , control experiments with myc-p36-transformed cells verified that permeabilization with triton x- <dig> allowed for the immunodetection  of endogenous proteins within the cytosol  and within subcellular compartments , whereas permeabilization with digitonin allowed for the immunodetection of only cytosolic proteins . figure  <dig> shows also that when myc-p36- or p36-myc-transformed cells were permeabilized with either triton x- <dig> or digitonin both expressed proteins were immunodetected, whereas endogenous e1β was only immunodetected in the corresponding triton-x-100-permeabilized cells. likewise, myc-p <dig> was immunodetected in both triton x-100- and digitonin-permeabilized cells that were incubated with antibodies specific for myc or the p <dig> c-terminal peptide mentioned above, i.e., amino acid residues 218– <dig> located downstream of the second  predicted tmds in p <dig> 

overall, these data are in agreement with the previously proposed model for the membrane topology of p <dig> based on the hydropathy profile of the protein's primary amino acid sequence  <cit>  and protease resistance analyses of p <dig> in either cirv-infected plants or isolated mitochondria  <cit> . in this model, p <dig> is predicted to be an integral membrane protein that contains two tmds , an intervening loop region  orientated towards the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and n- and c terminal portions of the protein  that face the cytosol. unfortunately, our efforts to confirm the inward orientation of the intervening loop sequence in p <dig> were unsuccessful, because addition of the myc-epitope sequence to this portion of the protein caused the resulting mutant to be mislocalized from mitochondria to the cytosol in transformed cells , a result that is likely due to the fact that, as discussed below, the loop sequence of p <dig> contains essential mitochondrial targeting information that was disrupted by the addition of the myc-epitope motif.

an internal domain of p <dig> composed of two tmds and an intervening loop sequence functions as a mitochondrial targeting signal
while previous studies using chimeras of cirv p <dig> and cymrsv p <dig>  expressed either in the context of the full-length virus or alone, revealed that the n terminal half of each protein is responsible for its sorting to mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively  <cit> , results from subsequent mutational analyses of p <dig> expressed alone provided only limited insight to the precise nature the protein's mitochondrial targeting information  <cit> . for instance, based on the targeting results of various p <dig> deletion mutants, weber-lotfi et al.  <cit>  concluded that the mitochondrial sorting of p <dig> is mediated by multiple determinants located within a relatively large portion of the protein's n-terminal half, i.e., residues 84– <dig> which includes both of the protein's tmds and their flanking regions, and that together these determinants might function cooperatively as a so-called signal loop-anchor type mitochondrial targeting sequence. these authors also speculated that this putative signal loop-anchor targeting sequence for p <dig> was unique because, rather than being comprised of non-continuous structural elements and/or three-dimensional folding features, such as those that typically constitute the targeting determinants in host-cell multi-spanning mitochondrial outer membrane proteins with β-barrel structures, the mitochondrial targeting determinants in p <dig>  were part of a linear stretch of the protein. the physicochemical properties of these potentially novel targeting determinants in p <dig> were not, however, defined. thus, to better understand the mitochondrial targeting information in p <dig> we carried out a comprehensive mutational analysis of the protein, employing initially both gain-of-function targeting assays with different portions of p <dig> fused to a reporter protein  and domain-swapping assays with p <dig> and p <dig> .

as shown in figure 3a, gain-of-function targeting experiments were carried out using a series of fusion proteins that consisted of p <dig>  or portions thereof, appended to the bacterial passenger protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase  and that were expressed transiently in by- <dig> cells. the representative micrographs presented in figure 3b show that while cat expressed alone accumulated throughout the cytosol, p36-cat, consisting of full-length p <dig> fused to the n terminus of cat, localized exclusively to aggregated mitochondria. these latter data are consistent with the localization of myc-tagged and wild-type p <dig> to  mitochondria in by- <dig> cells , as well as p <dig> fused to gfp and expressed transiently  in tobacco leaf mesophyll cells  <cit> , and indicate that the cat moiety used here as a reporter passenger protein does not alter the sorting behaviour of p <dig> 

similar to p36-cat, p <dig> 1-190-cat, containing residues 1– <dig> of p <dig> including the protein's n-terminal hydrophilic domain, tmds  <dig> and  <dig>  and the intervening loop sequence appended to cat, localized to  mitochondria , confirming also the results presented previously by weber-lotfi et al.  <cit>  that the n-terminal half of the protein contains its mitochondrial targeting information. by contrast, p <dig> 1-120-cat, which includes only the n-terminal hydrophilic domain and tmd <dig> of p <dig>  accumulated in the cytosol. notably, the mitochondria in these p <dig> 1-120-cat-transformed cells, similar to mitochondria in cells transformed with cat alone, were not altered in terms of their morphology and/or distribution , and reinforcing the notion that this fusion protein was not targeted to mitochondria.

other p36-cat fusion proteins comprised of smaller portions of the p <dig> n-terminal half also did not target to mitochondria. that is, both p <dig> 90-164-cat and p <dig> 120-164-cat, consisting of tmd <dig> and the intervening loop sequence and the intervening loop sequence alone, respectively, localized to the cytosol . on the other hand, both p <dig> 120-190-cat and p <dig> 90-190-cat localized to  mitochondria, albeit the former fusion protein only did so in a relatively inefficient manner since it accumulated also in the cytosol . based on the results presented here , p <dig> 90-190-cat contains the minimally sufficient portion of the protein capable of efficiently targeting cat to mitochondria and, similar to wild-type p <dig>  is localized to the outer membranes of mitochondria in an nout-cout topology .

characterization of the mitochondrial targeting information in p <dig> was also carried out using domain-swapping assays with tbsv p <dig>  an ortholog of cymrsv that has been recently well characterized in terms of its peroxisomal membrane targeting signal  <cit> . alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences for p <dig> and p <dig> revealed that while these proteins are nearly identical in their c-terminal halves, they are significantly divergent with respect to their n termini . for instance, although both proteins are predicted to contain two tmds located at relatively similar positions within their n-terminal halves , p <dig> also possesses a number of amino acid residues in this region of the protein that are not found in p <dig>  the most conspicuous of these being stretches of unique residues located near the extreme n terminus and within the intervening loop sequence of p <dig> . alignment of the p <dig> and p <dig> sequences revealed also that the multiple targeting signal motifs responsible for sorting nascent p <dig> initially to peroxisomes   and then from peroxisomes to a subdomain of the endoplasmic reticulum  referred to as peroxisomal er     <cit>  are not conserved in p <dig>  consistent with the apparently distinct intracellular sorting pathways employed by these two proteins.

as shown in figures 4b and 4c, p36-myc and p33-myc  sorted exclusively to aggregated mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively, in transiently-transformed by- <dig> cells. the aggregation of peroxisomes in p33-myc-transformed cells is apparent by comparing the immunostaining pattern attributable to the endogenous peroxisomal matrix enzyme catalase in these cells with that of p36-myc-transformed cells, wherein catalase-containing peroxisomes display a normal  morphology and distribution . these data for the localization of p33-myc to altered peroxisomes was expected, since previously published results with wild-type  p <dig> expressed for the same length of time  revealed that it was localized exclusively to peroxisomes and caused the organelles to coalesce  <cit> . also similar to wild-type p <dig>  <cit> , p33-myc sorted from peroxisomes to per at later time points following bombardment  , indicating that the myc epitope also did not disrupt the normal peroxisome-to-per sorting of the protein. nevertheless, in order to minimize any potential sorting complexities associated with the targeting of p <dig> from peroxisome to per at later time points, all of p33/p36-myc hybrids employed in domain-swapping assays were assessed only at  <dig> h post-bombardment for peroxisomal versus mitochondrial targeting.

replacement of the n-terminal half of p <dig>  with the corresponding sequences from p <dig> , including the n-terminal hydrophilic domain and both tmds plus the intervening loop sequence, resulted in the hybrid protein  being sorted to aggregated mitochondria, but not to peroxisomes . conversely, p <dig> 1– <dig> p36-myc, consisting of the n-terminal half of p <dig>  including all three of the protein's peroxisomal targeting signals   <cit> , fused to the c-terminal half of p <dig>  sorted exclusively to peroxisomes in a manner similar to full-length p33-myc .

figures 4b and 4c show also that fusion of the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of p <dig>  to the remaining c-terminal portion of p33-myc resulted in the hybrid protein  being localized to the cytosol, a result similar to when this n-terminal region of p <dig> was fused to cat  . localization to the cytosol was observed also when the intervening loop sequence from p <dig> was replaced with the loop sequence from p <dig> , indicating that this region of p <dig> contains essential mitochondrial targeting information. in accordance with this premise, the p <dig> intervening loop sequence together with its second tmd was capable of redirecting, albeit inefficiently, p33-myc to mitochondria, i.e., p <dig> 120– <dig> p33-myc was sorted to both mitochondria and peroxisomes , and further showing that this hybrid protein contains targeting information for both organelles. by contrast, mitochondrial targeting of p <dig> was completely abolished when its intervening loop sequence and tmd <dig> was replaced with the corresponding sequences from p <dig> , i.e., p <dig> 103– <dig> p36-myc was not localized to mitochondria, but instead localized to both peroxisomes and the cytosol . the apparent inefficient sorting of this hybrid protein to peroxisomes is likely due to the fact that it possessed only one of the three peroxisomal targeting signals within p <dig>  i.e., -r124psvpkk130- .

overall, the data presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> confirm and extend the observations of weber-lotfi et al.  <cit>  that the minimally sufficient mitochondrial targeting information in p <dig> is located within protein's n-terminal half, including both tmds and the intervening loop sequence. additional flanking sequences immediately upstream and downstream of tmd <dig> and tmd <dig>  respectively, are not essential, however, for targeting p <dig> to mitochondria. for instance, the n-terminal hydrophilic portion of p <dig> was insufficient in sorting cat  or a p36/p <dig> hybrid protein containing the remaining c terminal portion of p <dig>  to mitochondria. thus, our data contradict the previously proposed notion that the n-terminal hydrophilic domain of p <dig>  specifically, the residues immediately upstream of tmd <dig>  contain a distinct mitochondrial targeting determinant  <cit> . it appears instead that p <dig> contains only one mitochondrial targeting signal: a signal that consists of a relatively large portion of the protein  and includes several different structural elements, i.e., two tmds and an intervening soluble loop sequence. the relative contribution of these elements likely mediates the various aspects of p <dig> biogenesis including maintaining solubility before membrane insertion, targeting to mitochondria, and/or ensuring proper assembly in the mitochondrial outer membrane.

the moderate hydrophobicity of tmd <dig> and tmd <dig> is essential for targeting p <dig> to mitochondria
the results presented above indicate that the sorting of p <dig> to mitochondria is, at least in part, dependent upon its tmds. thus, to test whether specific amino acid sequences or more global properties, e.g., overall hydrophobicity and/or length, within one or both of the tmds contribute important mitochondrial targeting information, we generated several different mutant versions of p36-myc containing altered tmd sequences . included among these p <dig> tmd mutants were those that contained sequences derived from either tbsv p <dig> or the mitochondrial outer membrane-localized isoform of cytochrome b <dig> , a tail-anchored protein whose mitochondrial targeting signal consists of several unique physicochemical and sequence-specific characteristics within its single c-terminal tmd and hydrophilic tail domain  <cit> . by replacing tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> in p <dig> with either the corresponding tmds from p <dig> or the tmd from cb <dig> , we sought to determine what role the p <dig> and p <dig> tmds play in mitochondrial versus peroxisomal targeting and, in the case of p <dig> and cb <dig>  whether these two proteins possess functionally equivalent mitochondrial targeting information within their tmds.

as shown in figure 5b, when the sequences for tmd <dig> and tmd <dig> in p <dig> were exchanged the resulting mutant protein  localized exclusively to mitochondria. interestingly, the morphology and distribution of the mitochondria in these cells, unlike in wild-type p36-myc-transformed cells , did not appear to be altered . these data suggest that the relative positions of the two tmds within p <dig> influence the effects that this protein has on mitochondria morphology/distribution, but not its intracellular sorting.

an examination of the tmd amino acid sequences within p <dig>  did not reveal any noticeable conserved features. for instance, with the exception that both tmds possess similar  average hydrophobicity indexes  of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , they vary in their overall length . moreover, they contain no obvious conserved amino acid sequence-specific motifs or an enrichment of particular amino acid residues. therefore, the possibility was tested that the overall hydrophobic nature of the tmds was the functional determinant in sorting p <dig> to mitochondria. toward this end, either tmd <dig> or tmd <dig>  or both tmds together, in p <dig> were replaced with artificial  amino sequences composed of multiple -lalv-repeats  <cit>  while still maintaining the length of the tmds in p <dig>  i.e., 18- and 23-long repeats of -lalv-corresponding to the length of tmd <dig> and tmd <dig> in p <dig>  respectively. as shown in figure 5b, all three of the resulting mutant versions of p36-myc  mislocalized to cytosol and to some unknown punctate compartment that did not colocalize with endogenous mitochondrial e1β , nor peroxisomal catalase . similarly, replacement of tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> in p <dig> with the  <dig> amino-acid long single tmd from the mitochondrial isoform of cb <dig>  <cit>  resulted in both mutant proteins  being mislocalized to the cytosol. by contrast, both p36-myc tmd1Δp33tmd <dig> and p36-myc tmd2Δp33tmd <dig> in which tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> of p <dig> were replaced with tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> from p <dig>  respectively, sorted to  mitochondria in a manner similar to wild-type p36-myc .

as shown also in figure 5b, n-terminal myc-tagged cb <dig>  localized exclusively to mitochondria, as previously published  <cit> . replacement of the single tmd in myc-cb <dig> with tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> from p <dig>  however, resulted in the corresponding mutant proteins being mislocalized either to the cytosol  or to the er  ; although in a small proportion  of the cells transformed with myc-cb5Δp36tmd <dig> the mutant protein targeted to mitochondria in a manner similar to that of wild-type myc-cb <dig> .

together, the data presented in figure  <dig> imply that not all hydrophobic sequences are sufficient to replace tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> in p <dig> in terms of mediating its proper targeting to mitochondria. however, a pertinent question based on these data is why the tmds from p <dig>  a peroxisomal membrane-localized protein  <cit> , but not an idealized hydrophobic tmd, nor the tmd from an authentic mitochondrial outer membrane protein cb <dig>  <cit> , are capable of preserving the targeting of p <dig> to mitochondria? one possibility is that the relatively moderate overall hydrophobicity of the tmds in p <dig> is an essential feature of the protein's mitochondrial targeting signal. based on this premise, the mislocalization of p <dig> when one  of its tmds was replaced with either an artificial tmd or the cb <dig> tmd was due to the relatively high hydrophobic indexes of these introduced sequences, i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid-long synthetic tmds and  <dig>  for the  <dig> amino acid-long cb <dig> tmd, compared to those for p <dig> tmd <dig>  and tmd <dig> . by contrast, the mitochondrial targeting of p <dig> was not disrupted when its tmds were replaced individually with the relatively moderate hydrophobic tmds from p <dig>  i.e.,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for tmd <dig> and tmd <dig>  respectively.

this scenario that the mitochondrial sorting of p <dig> is mediated, at least in part, by the moderate hydrophobic nature of its tmds is in agreement with results from several other studies on the sorting of authentic mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. that is, depending on the protein, a moderate hydrophobic tmd, combined with positive charges at its flanking soluble regions, is essential for mitochondrial outer membrane targeting . for example, the 20-kd and 70-kd subunits of the tom complex  and tom <dig>  from yeast all contain moderately hydrophobic tmds that are functionally interchangeable in terms of their targeting behaviour  <cit> . the mammalian  tom <dig> and yeast mitochondrial outer membrane protein fission  <dig>  also appear to rely on the moderate hydrophobicity of their tmds, since increasing their overall hydrophobic score via mutagenesis resulted in both modified proteins being mislocalized  <cit> . conversely, reducing the overall hydrophobicity of an artificial tmd within a yeast er-localized reporter membrane protein by introducing one or more hydrophilic residues caused it to relocalize from the er to mitochondria  <cit> .

a notable extension of this model is that, for at least some mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, they appear to rely also on subtle sequence-specific features within their tmds. for instance, both the yeast 5-kd and 7-kd tom subunits  possess a conserved proline residue near the center of their tmds that is required for their efficient targeting to mitochondria  <cit> . while the precise role of this proline in the mitochondrial targeting of these proteins has not been determined, it may be due to the residue's ability to destabilize the tmd's α-helical structure and, thus, dictate its overall configuration and subsequent interaction with the proper cognate receptor and/or integration/assembly factor  <cit> . interestingly, targeting of mitochondrial plant cb <dig> also appears to rely on a conserved proline residue that forms part of a short hydrophilic surface situated within the protein's tmd  <cit> . based on this, it is perhaps not surprising that replacement of the cb <dig> tmd with either tmd <dig> or tmd <dig> from p <dig> resulted in both of the modified cb <dig> proteins being either completely  or partially  mislocalized within cells . that is, the nature of the targeting information within the tmds of p <dig> and cb <dig> appear to be sufficiently distinct in terms of their relative overall hydrophobicity and the presence  of sequence-specific motifs, such that they are not functionally interchangeable. as discussed below, these apparent differences in the targeting elements within the tmds of p <dig> and cb <dig> also appear to reflect the relative contribution of unique positively-charged targeting elements at their flanking regions.

the intervening loop sequence of p <dig> contains an amphipathic helix with a positively-charged face that is essential for mitochondrial targeting
since the intervening loop sequence in p <dig>  is significantly divergent from the corresponding loop sequence in peroxisomal-targeted p <dig>  and since replacement of this region in p <dig> with that from p <dig> resulted in the hybrid protein  being mislocalized to the cytosol , we analyzed this region in p <dig> to determine if it contained any distinctive features involved in mitochondrial targeting. figure 6a shows that the deduced amino acid sequence of the p <dig> intervening loop, specifically the central portion of this sequence that is devoid in p <dig> , is enriched in both positively-charged  and hydroxylated  amino acid residues. this central region of the p <dig> intervening loop also has the propensity  to form an α-helix, one with amphipathic characteristics conveyed by a positively-charged face .

based on these observations and previous reports that the targeting of several other authentic mitochondrial outer membrane-destined proteins rely on positively-charged residues together with a flanking tmd  <cit> , we examined further the positively-charged face of the amphipathic helix in p <dig> by mutational analyses. as shown in figures 6b and 6c, deletion of amino acid residues 131– <dig> in p36-myc resulted in the mutant  being mislocalized to the cytosol. these data are consistent with the mislocalization of p36-myc when its intervening loop sequence was replaced with that of p <dig> .

mitochondrial targeting of p36-myc was also abolished when glycine residues were exchanged for each of the four positively-charged residues predicted to be situated along the same face of the amphipathic α-helix within the protein's intervening loop sequence, i.e., p36-myc k134k137r144k151Δg mislocalized to the cytosol . by contrast, glycine substitutions of another cluster of positively-charged residues  located immediately upstream of tmd <dig> did not disrupt the sorting of p36-myc to mitochondria . these latter results, as well as those presented earlier for the mislocalization of p <dig> 1-120-cat  and p <dig> 1– <dig> p33-myc  reinforce our conclusion that, in contrast to the findings reported by weber-lotfi et al.  <cit> , the n-terminal hydrophilic region located upstream of tmd <dig> in p <dig> does not contain mitochondrial targeting information.

the results for p36-myc k93k94r98r101Δg also indicate that not all mutations to the protein affected its mitochondrial targeting fidelity. an observation that underscores a substantive caveat of this study  whereby mutations of p <dig> that resulted in the protein's mislocalization could have been due to aberrant protein folding, rather than a disruption of a specific targeting determinant. although this possibility cannot be excluded, our combined use of loss-of-function and gain-of-function targeting assays strongly supports our definition of the bona fide mitochondrial targeting information within p <dig> 

collectively, our findings on the combined importance of positively-charged residues  and moderate hydrophobic tmds  in the mitochondrial targeting of p <dig>  as well as the nout-cout topological orientation of the protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane , suggests that the insertion and assembly of p <dig> involves a signal loop-anchor mechanism  <cit> . that is, interaction of the positively-charged residues in the intervening loop sequence of nascent p <dig> with the mitochondrial outer surface might promote a conformational change that drives insertion of its moderate hydrophobic tmds into the bilayer, and results in the proper nout-cout topology. this proposed signal loop-anchor mechanism is consistent, as mentioned above, with results from previous in vitro insertion experiments with p <dig> and isolated mitochondria  <cit> . moreover, since the topological orientation of p <dig> is identical to the topology of the authentic outer mitochondrial membrane proteins yeast fuzzy onion  <dig>  and its mammalian homologs, mitofusin   <dig> and  <dig>  i.e., anchored in an nout-cout manner by two α-helical tmds connected via a short loop sequence located in the intermembrane space  <cit> , it is possible that the signal loop-anchor insertion of p <dig> is mediated by the same mitochondrial machinery that is utilized by fzo <dig> and mfn1/ <dig>  results of experiments aimed at addressing this possibility are described next.

p <dig> interacts with certain components of the mitochondrial tom complex, but not with the mitochondrial sam complex
almost all mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized on free polyribosomes in the cytosol, and targeted post-translationally to the organelle. thereafter, the recognition, translocation, and sorting of these proteins is usually mediated by the tom complex and, depending on the protein's submitochondrial destination, one of several other translocase complexes located in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes . for instance, based on studies carried out primarily with yeast and mammalian model systems, it is well established that nascent proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix or inner membrane are recognized by the import receptors tom <dig> and tom <dig> and then delivered to one of two discrete translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane  complexes. the majority of proteins destined for the outer mitochondrial membrane in yeast and mammals also rely on the tom complex, but appear to do so in a number of different ways depending on their topology . for example, mitochondrial outer membrane proteins with multiple α-helical tmds, including mfn1/ <dig>  utilize the receptor tom <dig>  but not other components of the tom complex  <cit> . β-barrel outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, such as porin and the channel forming subunit of the tom complex, tom <dig>  as well as c-terminal tail-anchored subunits of the tom complex , are recognized mainly by tom <dig> and then subsequently transferred to the sam complex  <cit> , a hetero-oligomeric complex located in the mitochondrial outer membrane where it functions in β-barrel protein insertion and assembly  <cit> . interestingly, another subset of c-terminal, tail-anchored outer membrane proteins, including bax and fis <dig>  do not require any known import  components, but instead appear to rely on the unique lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane for their proper targeting and insertion  <cit> .

while it is generally accepted that the various mitochondrial import pathways and associated machinery are conserved among evolutionarily diverse organisms including yeast, animals and plants, considerable differences exist among some of their core protein subunit compositions and functional specificities, particularly in plants  <cit> . thus, p <dig> may or may not use the same mitochondrial insertion machinery in plants as that employed by multi-spanning mitochondrial outer membrane proteins in yeasts and mammals, such as the tom70-dependent targeting of mfn1/ <dig>  <cit> . the targeting and insertion of p <dig> may be also more similar to that of yeast fis <dig>  which is mediated primarily by the distinct lipid composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane  <cit> , a possibility that appears to be consistent with previous data indicating that p <dig> does not to rely on any mitochondrial-surface proteinaceous receptors  <cit> . this latter conclusion, however, was based solely on the observation that pre-treatment of isolated mitochondria with trypsin to remove any exposed parts of surface receptors did not prevent membrane insertion of p <dig>  indeed, this apparent lack of sensitivity to trypsin is not evidence a priori that p <dig> import does not utilize a proteinaceous receptor, since mitochondrial surface receptors can display differences in terms of their sensitivity/resistance to an applied protease  <cit>  and can even be bypassed in vitro such that a chloroplast protein can be imported into protease-pretreated mitochondria with the same efficiency as a mitochondrial protein that normally relies on a surface receptor  <cit> .

to determine the insertion pathway of p <dig> into the outer mitochondrial membrane we tested whether it could interact directly with a variety of protein components of the plant tom and/or sam complexes. specifically, we employed bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assays to determine whether in vivo physiological interactions occur between p <dig> and four arabidopsis tom protein subunits including: i) the tom <dig> import receptor  <cit> ; ii) tom <dig>  which may function in a manner similar to yeast and mammalian tom <dig> by providing some receptor function, but mostly as a link between the primary receptors tom <dig> and tom <dig>  <cit> ; iii) tom <dig>  the central pore-forming subunit of the tom complex  <cit> ; and iv) mtom <dig> , which functions as an import receptor and, based on structural similarities, may be a paralog of yeast and mammalian tom <dig>  <cit> . we also tested whether p <dig> physically interacts with arabidopsis metaxin, a diverged form of the sam component sam <dig> and metaxin <dig> in yeasts and mammals, respectively  <cit> .

by- <dig> cells were transiently transformed with pairs of plasmids encoding p <dig> fused at its c terminus to the c-terminal half of the modified yellow fluorescent protein venus  <cit>   and one of the tom or sam proteins fused at either their n or c termini to the n-terminal half of venus  ; refer to illustrations of various proteins in figure 7b showing their predicted topological orientations in the mitochondrial outer membrane and the relative location of their appended venus fragment. because each half of venus is not intrinsically fluorescent, venus fluorescence is observed only when intermolecular interactions occur between nvenus- and cvenus-tagged proteins  <cit> , highlighting an advantage of bifc over other protein-protein interaction assays  in that the subcellular localization of the interacting proteins can directly be observed in living cells via microscopy. all cells were also co-bombarded with a third plasmid encoding the red fluorescent protein , which served as an internal standard for transformation efficiency and aided in identifying transformed cells.

alternatively, by- <dig> cells were co-bombarded with a plasmid coding for an individual nvenus- or cvenus-tagged protein along with a plasmid encoding βatpase-gfp , which served to identify transformed cells and, acting as a well-characterized mitochondrial marker protein  <cit> . as presented in additional file 3a, results from these latter experiments provided confirmation of the expression of each of the individual venus half fusion proteins -epitope tag; see methods and materials for details on the construction of bifc plasmids), as well as their mitochondrial localization. additional results confirming the topological orientation of several of these venus half fusion proteins in by- <dig> cells using the differential detergent permeabilization assay are presented in additional file 3b.

the results presented in figure 7a show that p <dig>  interacted in vivo with all three of the nvenus-tagged versions of the putative import receptors, tom <dig>  tom <dig> and mtom <dig>  notably, the interaction of p <dig> with tom <dig> was unaffected when the receptor protein's n-terminal tetratricopeptide motif-based domain responsible for the recognition and interaction with mitochondrial precursor proteins  was deleted , suggesting that the interaction of p <dig> with the tom <dig> is not mediated by this substrate-receptor-binding motif. p <dig> did not interact, however, with either tom <dig>  the sam component metaxin, or itself  . while these latter data appear to contradict those published elsewhere for the homo-oligmerization of the p36-related protein, tbsv p <dig>  and, p36-p <dig> and other p36-protein interactions likely occur within the context of the functional cirv replication complex and, thus, mediated by the allied replication protein, p <dig>  as well viral rna template  <cit> .

in a series of control experiments we also evaluated whether or not the βatpase matrix targeting presequence and/or the full-length outer mitochondrial β-barrel membrane protein, porin, interacted with the tom and sam complex protein subunits in a manner similar to p <dig>  as shown in figure 7a, the data obtained for βatpase and porin are mostly in accordance with the current working models for the mitochondrial import pathways used by these two proteins  <cit> . for instance, both βatpase and porin  interacted with the nvenus-tagged versions of tom <dig>  tom <dig> and mtom <dig>  reflecting the apparent functional redundancy of these import receptors in plants  <cit> . likewise, porin interacted with the n-terminal mutant version of tom <dig> , but βatpase did not, supporting the notion that the import of matrix-destined proteins is dependent primarily on tom <dig> via the receptor's n-terminal tetratricopeptide motif domain  <cit> . the relative importance of the mtom <dig> receptor in βatpase and porin  import using a similar mutagenesis-bifc approach was not, however, assessed, since deletion of the predicted substrate-receptor binding motif in mtom <dig>  <cit>  disrupted its sorting to mitochondria in by- <dig> cells .

at least one unexpected finding from the bifc experiments presented in figure 7a was that both βatpase and porin  did not interact with tom <dig>  the putative primary subunit of the tom complex import channel  <cit> . these results contradict those obtained primarily from studies with yeasts and mammals, wherein tom <dig> participates in the import of most types of mitochondrial proteins including those destined for the matrix or outer membrane  <cit> . one possible reason for this apparent lack of interaction between tom <dig> and βatpase and porin  is that this putative channel protein, while being efficiently targeted to mitochondria when expressed individually in by- <dig> cells , was not properly inserted/assembled into functional tom complexes and, thus, could not participate in mitochondrial protein import. another possible reason may be that the nvenus fragment appended to tom <dig>  is sterically inaccessible, such that even if the fusion protein was properly assembled into the tom complex it could not interact with cvenus appended to either co-expressed βatpase, porin or p <dig>  unfortunately, since another tom <dig> fusion protein with nvenus appended to its c terminus  was not sorted to mitochondria in by- <dig> cells  and because no other experimental data has been published for the structure and/or function of a plant tom <dig>  resolution of this issue remains to be addressed.

in additional control experiments tbsv p <dig>  was not observed to interact with any of the tom complex subunit proteins tested nor with p <dig> . these results were entirely expected since p <dig> sorts to peroxisomes and not to mitochondria . interactions were also not observed between p <dig> and porin or p <dig> and cb <dig> , indicating that, similar to the negative results discussed above for βatpase  and metaxin, the positive venus signals detected for certain other protein pairs was due to their specific protein-protein interaction. however, related to these control experiments with p <dig>  porin and cb <dig>  it is important to note that, whereas cb <dig> and p <dig> are orientated in outer mitochondrial membranes in an nout-cin  <cit>  and nout-cout manner , respectively, porin contains two putative tmds and orientated in an nin-cin manner . thus, while cvenus appended to porin  is predicted to be located in the intermembrane space, nvenus appended to p <dig>  faces the cytosol  and, thus, the lack of a bifc signal for these two proteins when co-expressed in by- <dig> cells was expected given the physical separation of their corresponding venus halves  <cit> .

taken together, the bifc results presented in figure 7a indicate that p <dig> interacts with a variety of import receptors in the tom complex including tom <dig>  tom <dig>  and mtom <dig>  consistent with recent findings that, compared to yeasts and mammals, the mitochondrial import apparatus in plants is highly flexible with overlapping specificity  <cit> . our bifc results indicate also that whereas the porin interacts with the putative sam component metaxin, p <dig>  does not. hence, metaxin appears to participate specifically in the assembly of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins containing a β-barrel structure, a conclusion that extends the findings presented previously for the role of this mitochondrial import component in plants  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
viruses are well known for their ability to exploit specific organelles and pathways in infected host cells in order to facilitate their replication  <cit> . here we showed that p <dig>  an essential component of the cirv replication complex and a key factor involved in the virus' ability to transmogrify mitochondria into mvbs in infected plant cells, contains a prototypic mitochondrial outer membrane targeting signal. that is, similar to the targeting signals characterized for most authentic mitochondrial outer membrane proteins in evolutionarily diverse organisms  <cit> , the p <dig> targeting signal consists of a cluster of positively-charged residues flanked by moderately hydrophobic tmds. we showed also that p <dig> interacts with several tom components, specifically the import receptors tom <dig>  tom <dig> and mtom <dig>  these results, combined with the apparent conservation of a functional outer mitochondrial targeting signal in p <dig>  indicate that cirv has evolved a strategy to utilize the host-cell mitochondrial sorting pathways in order to control or modulate the biogenesis and/or function of the organelle to its own advantage. for instance, mitochondrial-derived mvbs in cirv-infected cells could provide the necessary structural framework or platform for replication complex assembly and/or provide a sophisticated protective structure that shields the nascent viral rna or viral replication proteins from degradation. both of these possibilities have been proposed previously for other viruses that also rely on the mitochondrial outer membrane for their replication  <cit> .

while the functional significance of the cirv-mitochondria relationship and the molecular mechanisms underlying the membrane rearrangements that occur during mitochondrial mvb biogenesis in cirv-infected cells remain to be elucidated, future studies aimed at understanding these processes, similar to results presented here for the sorting of p <dig>  will undoubtedly provide insights to certain aspects of normal mitochondrial biogenesis in plant cells . to date, only one plant outer mitochondrial membrane protein, cb <dig>  has been well examined in terms of its targeting signal and insertion mechanism  <cit> . thus, as other plant outer mitochondrial membrane proteins begin to be investigated, including those identified using proteomic- and/or bioinformatics-based approaches  <cit> , the properties of the p <dig> targeting signal and its import mechanism will serve as a useful reference.
