BACKGROUND
mesenchymal stem cells  have been identified in many human tissues and are thought to be responsible for tissue homeostasis. adipose tissue constitutes an abundant source of mscs  <cit> . we have shown that adipose stem cells  with a cd45-cd31-cd34+cd105+ phenotype can be isolated with ~99% purity from the stromal vascular fraction of human liposuction material  <cit> . human ascs exhibit primarily mesodermal differentiation capacity in vitro  <cit> , and in vivo may contribute to improvements of osteogenic  <cit> , neuronal  <cit> , immune  <cit>  and vascular functions  <cit> . ascs display an immunophenotype similar to bone marrow mscs and express genes extending across the three germ layers, supporting a differentiation potential toward non-mesodermal lineages  <cit> .

single cell-derived clonal cultures of human ascs, however, show that differentiation capacity in vitro varies between cell clones  <cit> . analysis of dna methylation at promoters of lineage-specific genes showed that freshly isolated, undifferentiated ascs display mosaically under-methylated adipogenic gene promoters ; in contrast, myogenic  and endothelial  promoters are hypermethylated  <cit> . methylation of a cytosine in a cpg dinucleotide is a heritable modification that favors genomic integrity, ensures proper regulation of gene expression and is essential for long-term gene silencing  <cit> . methylation profiles are maintained in clonal asc cultures up to  <dig> passages, or  <dig> population doublings from single cells, and do not correlate with gene expression level in undifferentiated or differentiated cells  <cit> . the unmethylated state of adipogenic promoters, together with the hypermethylation of endothelial and myogenic promoters and the maintenance of these methylation patterns after adipogenic, osteogenic or endothelial differentiation  <cit>  suggest that ascs are epigenetically committed to adipogenic differentiation preferentially over other lineages.

human and murine mscs cultured in vitro undergo replicative senescence and exhibit reduced differentiation potential upon prolonged culture  <cit> . loss of functionality of senescent mscs is presumably due to accumulation of oxidative damage on dna and proteins  <cit>  and to telomerase dysfunction  <cit> . in vivo, reduced ability of mscs to contribute to tissue repair in aged individuals has been attributed to a loss of msc function rather than to diminished stem cell numbers  <cit> .

aging is accompanied by changes in dna methylation in tumor suppressor genes  <cit>  and by stochastic methylation events throughout the genome  <cit> . culture may also induce random dna methylation errors as a result of infidelity in maintenance dna methylation  <cit> . in this study, we investigate the extent to which senescent clonal cultures of human ascs exhibit reduced differentiation potential in vitro and whether this may be attributed to changes in promoter dna methylation.

RESULTS
senescent ascs display reduced adipogenic differentiation potential
to investigate the effect of senescence on differentiation ability of ascs, we derived clonal cultures of ascs from single freshly isolated cells  <cit> . the adipogenic differentiation capacity of these clones in early passage cultures  has been described previously  <cit> . three clones, designated b <dig>  b <dig> and b <dig>  were cultured to senescence. senescence was reached at passage p <dig>  for clone b <dig>  p <dig>  for clone b <dig> and p <dig>  for clone b <dig>  senescence was manifested by cell cycle arrest, as judged by the absence of cell division on the basis of cell counts upon at least two rounds of subculture after these passage numbers were reached , and by typical enlarged cell morphology . passage number achieved at senescence is referred to as ps hereafter.

to evaluate the differentiation capacity of early passage vs. senescent cells, all clones were induced to differentiate toward the adipogenic pathway for three weeks, starting either at p <dig> or at ps. all p <dig> clones differentiated efficiently, on the basis of oil red-o staining . differentiation, however, was impaired in senescent cells . note that differentiation was elicited for each clone with  <dig>  cells/cm <dig> both at p <dig> and at ps, so we could not attribute differences in the extent of adipogenesis to differences in cell density.

quantitative analysis of expression of adipogenic genes in undifferentiated p <dig> and ps cells by real time reverse transcription  polymerase chain reaction  corroborated the reduced ability of senescent ascs to commit to adipogenesis. in undifferentiated p <dig> cells, expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma  <dig>  occurred at low levels and was not significantly altered in senescent cells in any of the clones . expression of fatty acid-binding protein  <dig>   <cit>  mrna, also detected at low levels at p <dig>  was unaltered at ps in clone b <dig> , but was upregulated 3-fold in clones b <dig> and b <dig> . transcripts for lipoprotein lipase  were undetectable at p <dig> or ps in clones b <dig> and b <dig>  consistent with previous observations  <cit> , but were expressed at a low level in both p <dig> and senescent cells in clone b <dig> . lastly, leptin  mrna was undetected in clone b <dig> but was upregulated 5- to 6-fold at senescence in clones b <dig> and b <dig> . it is noteworthy however, that all transcripts detected in undifferentiated p <dig> ascs were expressed at very low levels, as illustrated by elevated ct values  despite high real time pcr efficiency .

three weeks of adipogenic stimulation initiated at ps promoted upregulation of all genes relative to undifferentiated cells in all clones , except for lep which remained unchanged in clone b <dig> . extent of gene upregulation varied between clones, reflecting differences in the ability of each clone to commit to adipogenesis even in late passage culture . this is similar to what we previously observed with the same clones at passage  <dig>  <cit> . note, however, that a significant part of this variation was due to the low levels of transcripts detected in undifferentiated cells, small variations in which can result in large differences in relative upregulation upon differentiation . although transcriptional activation took place, lpl mrna levels in clones b <dig> and b <dig>  and lep mrna level in clone b <dig> could not be quantified as these genes were not expressed in undifferentiated cells . furthermore, fabp <dig> and lpl mrna levels in ascs after three weeks of adipogenic stimulation at p <dig> were higher than after induction of differentiation at ps , while those of pparg <dig> and lep were not different . impaired lipid accumulation and transcriptional activation of adipogenic genes during culture of ascs to senescence illustrate a reduced commitment to adipogenesis, despite stable or moderately upregulated transcript levels in undifferentiated cells.

adipogenic promoter dna methylation profiles remain stable upon culture to senescence
to determine whether reduced transcriptional level of adipogenic genes in senescent ascs had an underlying epigenetic basis, we assessed the dna methylation status in the lep, pparg <dig>  fabp <dig> and lpl promoters by bisulfite sequencing. bisulfite conversion of dna relies on the deamination of unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines are protected from deamination. pcr converts uracils to thymidines and sequencing of several pcr products cloned in bacteria enables a quantitative assessment of the position and number of methylated cytosines in the region examined  <cit> . regions analyzed by bisulfite sequencing in the lep, pparg <dig>  fabp <dig> and lpl promoters are shown in fig. 3a. we first validated the significance of the regions examined by showing that the extent of methylation was consistently lower in all promoters in differentiated sgbs  human adipocytes  than in peripheral blood t cells .

dna methylation profiles of undifferentiated senescent cells are shown in fig. 4a and illustrated for all individual clones in additional file  <dig>  supplementary fig.  <dig>  the lep, pparg <dig> and lpl promoters were largely hypomethylated in all clones examined, with percentages of methylation ranging from  <dig> to 29% . we found that the preferred areas of methylation in each locus we previously identified in early passage  cells  <cit>  were maintained in ps cells . furthermore, as in p <dig> cells, methylation profiles were mosaic in senescent cells, both between asc clones and within a clonal population . the fabp <dig> promoter displayed greater variation in global methylation with clone b <dig> being 25% methylated, while b <dig> was 75% methylated . note that although adipogenic differentiation potential was evaluated in ascs at p <dig> in this study, early passage methylation status was previously determined at p <dig>  <cit> ; however no or minimal methylation differences were anticipated between p <dig> and p <dig>  relative to senescence .

chi-square tests: a p <  <dig> ; b p <  <dig> ; c p <  <dig> ; ns non-significant.

methylation profiles of each promoter in senescent cells  were compared to those obtained earlier  <cit>  in the same asc clones cultured to p <dig> . methylation profiles remained overall similar during culture to senescence . however, two cpgs were found to be hypermethylated in fapb <dig> , owing to hypermethylation in clones b <dig> and b <dig> . moreover, we found one cpg to be hypomethylated in lpl  also owing to demethylation of this cytosine in clones b <dig> and b <dig> . when global percentages of methylation were compared between undifferentiated individual asc clones at p <dig> and ps, however, lep, pparg <dig> and fabp <dig> were found to be hypermethylated upon senescence in clone b <dig>  while clones b <dig> and b <dig> only showed lep and fapb <dig> hypermethylation, respectively . lpl promoter methylation was reduced between p <dig> and ps in clone b <dig> and remained stable in the other clones .

these results indicate that overall, adipogenic promoters retain the largely hypomethylated profile that characterizes ascs. nevertheless, a few cpgs become hyper- or hypomethylated upon senescence in the fabp <dig> and lpl promoters, respectively, albeit not in all clones.

adipogenic differentiation maintains methylation profiles at adipogenic promoters in senescent ascs
we next examined the methylation profile of adipogenic promoters after adipogenic stimulation in senescent cells and compared these profiles to those of cells differentiated at p <dig>  <cit> . methylation patterns were similar in the lep promoter in differentiated p <dig> and ps cells , with only two cpgs, no.  <dig> and  <dig>  being hypermethylated at ps . upon examination of individual clones, however, clones b <dig> and b <dig> displayed enhanced methylation at senescence  due to hypermethylation of several cpgs . in pparg <dig>  enhanced methylation was seen at ps compared to p <dig>  due to hypermethylation of cpgs no.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . the fabp <dig> and lpl promoters displayed remarkably similar methylation profiles in ps and p <dig> differentiated cells , with only clone b <dig> showing fabp <dig> hypermethylation in differentiated ps cells  due to enhanced methylation of cpg  <dig> . finally, we found that methylation profiles of all promoters were overall similar in undifferentiated and in adipogenic-stimulated ps cells , except for hypermethylation of cpg  <dig> in the lep promoter . we concluded that overall, methylation patterns in adipogenic promoters are similar between adipogenic-stimulated cells in early passage and at senescence. however, as with undifferentiated cells, specific cpgs appear to be hyper- or hypomethylated in a promoter-specific and cell clone-specific manner.

we occasionally noted the substitution of a cytosine for a thymidine  in some lep bisulfite sequences, consistently at cpg no.  <dig> . sequences were unambiguous and displayed either a methylated c or an unmethylated c  or, unexpectedly a t . to account for this substitution, it has been proposed that cpg methylation increases the mutation rate from cpg to tpg or cpa, as suggested by the lower number of cpgs observed over that expected in mammalian genomes  <cit> .

in summary, methylation profiles at adipogenic promoters are generally maintained upon clonal culture of ascs to senescence. nevertheless, at the level of individual clones, methylation may be differentially affected in a gene-independent manner, but this does not necessarily correlate with transcriptional changes. adipogenic stimulation of early passage or senescent cells does not markedly affect adipogenic promoter dna methylation.

discussion
reduced adipogenic differentiation potential of senescent ascs is not related to changes in promoter dna methylation
little is known on alterations in dna methylation in mscs during in vitro aging and how these may relate to changes in differentiation potential. we examined three clonal lines of ascs with an ability to differentiate toward adipogenic  <cit> , osteogenic and endothelial pathways  <cit> . similarly to cultured bone marrow mscs  <cit> , all asc clones cultured to senescence displayed reduced adipogenic differentiation potential in vitro, on the basis of lipid synthesis and transcriptional upregulation of, primarily, fabp <dig> and lpl relative to the same clones in early passage cultures. interestingly however, basal transcription of these genes was unaltered  or moderately enhanced  in undifferentiated cells at ps. thus, reduced transcription efficiency in differentiated senescent cells cannot be attributed to lower transcript levels in the undifferentiated state.

what may be the basis for reduced adipogenic potential in senescent ascs? first, pparg <dig>  a master regulator of adipogenesis  <cit> , is upregulated to a level similar in early passage and senescent cells, thus we cannot explain reduced adipogenesis by pparγ insufficiency. second, adipogenic stimulation of senescent cells upregulates lpl expression, albeit to a lower level than in early passage cells. a suboptimal transcription level is likely to affect translation, preventing further phenotypic changes. of note, transcription without detectable protein expression seems to be a feature of undifferentiated ascs  <cit> . third, transcription or synthesis of transcriptional regulators of adipogenic genes, such as c/ebpα  <cit> , bmp <dig>  <cit>  or add1/srebp1c  <cit>  may be compromised in senescent cells and may account for adipogenesis deficiency despite the putative availability of binding sites . indeed, failure to express c/epbα results in inability to develop white adipose tissue in vivo  <cit> . fourth, adipogenic failure may also be due to impaired downregulation of gata2/ <dig>  pre-adipocyte factor  <dig> or wnt10b, whose expression blocks cells in a pre-adipocyte stage  <cit> .

to determine whether there was an epigenetic basis for reduced differentiation potential in senescent cells, we examined the dna methylation profiles in the lep, pparg <dig>  fabp <dig> and lpl promoters. senescent cells maintained the overall mosaic hypomethylation of lep, pparg <dig> and lpl previously reported in p <dig> cells  <cit> . fabp <dig> exhibited hypermethylation in two undifferentiated asc clones  at senescence. however, this did not correlate with reduced transcription potential upon adipogenic stimulation because clone b <dig>  which is not hypermethylated at senescence, showed similar a reduction in transcription level to clones b <dig> and b <dig>  mosaic methylation has been reported in other primary cell cultures  <cit>  and is likely the result of stochastic errors in maintenance methylation which occur over many rounds of replication. on the basis of our observations, therefore, it is difficult to attribute any change in promoter methylation to an effect of senescence per se.

relationship between cpg methylation and binding of transcriptional regulators
identification of relationships between the most hypomethylated areas in adipogenic promoters and binding sites for transcription factors argues that most, but not all, these sites remain available during culture. in the lep promoter, methylation of cpgs no. 4– <dig> in clones b <dig> and b <dig> covers a recognition site for the methyl-cpg binding protein kaiso  <cit> . moreover, two sp1binding sites span cpgs no.  <dig> and  <dig> while cpg no.  <dig> lies in a site occupied by an unidentified factor  <cit> . cpgs no. 15– <dig> are unmethylated at p <dig> and at senescence, presumably leaving these binding sites available. additionally, cpg no.  <dig> lies within a c/ebpα recognition site flanked by e boxes for putative add1/srebp <dig> binding, all of which are important for lep expression  <cit> . in contrast to cpgs no.15– <dig>  cpg no.  <dig> is hypermethylated in senescent ascs, but only in the context of adipogenic stimulation, in clones b <dig> and b <dig>  cpg no.  <dig> hypermethylation may account for limited or undetectable lep upregulation in adipogenic stimulated senescent cells. moreover, we found that lep transcripts increased 5–6-fold in undifferentiated senescent clones b <dig> and b <dig>  but not in clone b <dig>  which displayed heaviest methylation on cpg no. <dig>  therefore, methylation of cpg no. <dig> correlates with impaired lep transcriptional upregulation in senescent cells in the context of adipogenic stimulation.

methylation profiles of the lpl and fabp <dig> promoters further illustrates a functional relationship between dna methylation and transcription factor binding. the lpl promoter contains a ppar responsive element between cpgs no.  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , a sterol-responsive element acting as binding site for srebp1c  <cit> , and between cpgs no.  <dig> and  <dig>  a caat box and a binding sequence for oct <dig> and tfiib. notably, cpgs no. 7– <dig> are consistently unmethylated in both early and late passage ascs, thereby enabling transcriptional activation of lpl upon differentiation even in senescent cells. availability of transcription factor binding sites in senescent ascs also yields for the fabp <dig> promoter, which is strongly activated upon adipogenic stimulation. notably, this promoter harbors a c/ebpα binding site close to cpg no.  <dig>  <cit> , the only cytosine unmethylated regardless of asc donor  <cit> , cell clone and differentiation state in early passage and in senescent cells.

promoter dna methylation during senescence and aging
stochastic methylation in senescing ascs is reminiscent of random methylation patterns established in human intestinal crypt stem cells in aging individuals  <cit> . aging-related random methylation has been proposed to occur as a result of failure of maintenance methyltransferase activity, and/or exposure to environmental factors and health of the individual  <cit> . our results provide evidence that methylation changes detected in senescent ascs do not correlate with transcriptional defects and reduced differentiation potential. likewise, there is to date little evidence linking dna methylation of lineage-specific genes and aging-related impairment of stem cell function   <cit> , stochastic changes in gene expression  <cit>  and genome integrity  <cit> . nevertheless, comparing aging to in vitro replicative senescence should be made with caution, as age of mscs does not always affect differentiation potential in vitro  <cit> .

in summary, our results argue that reduction of adipogenic potential in senescent ascs may relate to transcriptional defects upon adipogenic stimulation. however, it cannot in general be attributed to specific methylation changes in adipogenic promoters, and thereby to availability of transcription factor binding sites regulated by cpg methylation. one exception to this contention is one cpg in the lep promoter , whose senescence-related methylation may impair upregulation of the gene upon adipogenic stimulation. there also seems to be a correlation between regions of cpgs hypomethylation and important transcription factor binding sites.

CONCLUSIONS
ascs cultured to senescence display reduced in vitro differentiation ability and transcriptional activation of adipogenic genes. these restrictions, however, cannot be attributed to specific changes in dna methylation on adipogenic promoters. there also seems to be a correlation between cpgs that are hypomethylated and important transcription factor binding sites.
