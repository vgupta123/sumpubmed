BACKGROUND
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  is a neurodegenerative disease affecting upper and lower motor neurons. the disease causes a progressive paralysis including paralysis of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. respiratory complications and failure are the most common cause of death in als  <cit> . prior to respiratory failure, als patients exhibit breathing abnormalities including hypercapnia  and hypoxemia   <cit>  as well as increased respiratory frequency and decreased tidal volume  <cit> . disease relevant respiratory abnormalities have been demonstrated in a mutant form of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase  <dig>  mouse model  <cit> , and a rat model of msod <dig> exhibited decreased motor output from the phrenic nerve  <cit> . in humans, a variety of genetic etiologies can result in als and here we studied breathing in a model based on the rna-binding protein fused in sarcoma/translocated in liposarcoma . we studied breathing parameters with a sensitive plethysmography system in a rat model. the main goal was to study breathing changes induced by fus in an effort to establish a sensitive early disease physiological marker for detecting either the efficacy of therapeutic intervention or potentiation of the disease state by disease modulators.

fus is an rna- and dna-binding protein that regulates transcription, alternative splicing, and mrna transport  <cit> . fus shares homology and some overlap in function with the rna-binding protein transactive response dna-binding protein of 43 kda . both proteins are associated with als and the related disease frontotemporal lobar degeneration   in terms of causative mutations and neuropathology . wild-type fus is found aggregated in ftld with fus-positive inclusions   and has also been found in pathological aggregates in sporadic als  <cit> . mutations of other rna-homeostasis proteins are also associated with als, including tata-binding protein associated factor  <dig>   <cit>  and ewing’s sarcoma breakpoint region  <dig>   <cit> , which further underscores the importance of rna metabolism in underlying disease mechanisms. we have previously established rat models of progressive paralysis by expressing tdp- <dig> . here we expressed fus in rats, in order to test the hypothesis that another als related rna-binding protein would exert a similar disease state, presumably by interference of normal rna metabolism. overexpression of wild-type fus has been shown to be toxic in yeast  and drosophila  <cit> , and a variety of rodent models have been developed using either mutant or wild-type fus, both forms showing evidence of motor impairments and als-like pathology . we used a novel and unique viral vector expression system in adult rats to study respiratory changes. rat physiological parameters such as heart rate and breathing are closer to humans than mice, so rats are therefore advantageous to study breathing parameters.

the adeno-associated virus  vector system is an advantageous method to control the onset of expression within specific neuronal populations. aav <dig> can be delivered intravenously in rats to yield wide-scale expression in the central nervous system  including efficient transduction of spinal motor neurons necessary for motor performance  <cit> . when tdp- <dig> was expressed in this manner, a highly consistent motor phenotype developed over time  <cit> . the first study used neonatal rats which provide very efficient gene transfer  <cit> . however, we recently adapted the approach to adult subjects which are more relevant to adult onset diseases such as als and ftld  <cit> . here we administered adult rats with aav <dig> fus and studied motor and respiratory parameters over time, including analysis of blood ph and blood gas content. we tested if the motor and respiratory sequelae would arise concomitantly or if one sequela would precede the other. plethysmography was also studied in aav <dig> tdp- <dig> transduced rats for the first time to address if a similar phenotype was induced by the two disease-related rna-binding proteins.

RESULTS
fus-induced disease state: decreased weight and motor impairments
to examine the effects of fus gene transfer in adult rats, three groups were examined:  aav <dig> fus ;  aav <dig> green fluorescent protein ; and  vehicle-only controls. the animals were weighed just before gene transfer and weekly up to 8 weeks . there was a significant effect of time on weight gain , f <dig>  =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ) as expected. there was a trend for an effect of treatment group , and there was a significant interaction between time post-injection and treatment group on weight , suggesting some differences in weight gain between treatment groups over time. for example, at the time points of  <dig> and 4 weeks, the fus group weighed less than the vehicle and gfp groups .fig.  <dig> fus gene transfer causes progressive motor impairments. a there was an indication of lowered weight gain in fus rats by anova . the fus group weighed significantly less than the vehicle and gfp groups at  <dig> and 4 weeks post-injection . b fus rats were significantly impaired for rotarod performance by anova with significant differences found at  <dig>   <dig>  or 4 weeks compared to the vehicle group  and at 4 weeks compared to the gfp group . c all of the fus rats developed hindlimb clenching during the escape reflex while no vehicle or gfp rats showed abnormal hindlimb clenching during the study . d the fus group had decreased forelimb strength at 4 weeks compared to both vehicle and gfp . there were no significant differences between the vehicle and gfp groups in any of these measures. “a”, significant difference between fus and vehicle groups; “b”, significant difference between fus and gfp 




to determine if rats administered aav <dig> fus developed motor impairments, animals were evaluated by rotarod, escape reflex, locomotor activity chamber, and forelimb grip strength. there were no differences found between the vehicle and gfp control groups on any of these measurements. on rotarod there was a significant effect of treatment group  indicating that fus affected rotarod ability. there was a significant effect of time on rotarod performance , as we have previously observed in young to middle age rats  <cit> . there was a significant interaction between treatment group over time  indicating that the fus rats exhibited progressively impaired rotarod ability over this period. the fus group showed significant rotarod deficits compared to the vehicle group at  <dig> and 4 weeks post-injection  and at 4 weeks post-injection compared to gfp animals . for the escape reflex, all of the vehicle and gfp animals retained hindlimb extension when lifted by the tail whereas all of the fus animals developed an abnormal hindlimb clenching . hindlimb clasping is an indicator of a lesion in the motor pathway  <cit> . however, in the locomotor testing, there were no significant effects of fus gene transfer on rearing or distance traveled in this study using this vector dose and interval . forelimb grip strength in the fus group was significantly decreased compared to both vehicle and gfp animals at 4 weeks post-injection /bonferroni, p <  <dig> ; fig. 1d). these motor tests suggest that gross motor function and coordination  in rats administered aav <dig> fus are impaired due to both dysfunctional hindlimbs  and forelimbs .

fus-induced disease state: plethysmographic changes
using unrestrained whole-body plethysmography, respiratory frequency, tidal volume, minute ventilation, inspiratory time, expiratory time, and total respiratory time were measured weekly throughout the study . between weeks  <dig> and  <dig> post-injection, fus animals began to display progressive breathing impairments characterized by rapid, shallow breathing patterns . the last plethysmography session before death or euthanasia was considered “end stage” which varied from  <dig> to 8 weeks depending on the individual animal treated with aav <dig> fus or aav <dig> tdp- <dig>  due to this range of onset times, we compared the baseline to the end stage of disease progression in the fus and tdp- <dig> animals. vehicle and gfp control rats were not affected in this manner, so baseline was compared with 8 weeks post-injection in the controls. for respiratory frequency, there were significant effects of vector and time as well as an interaction between the two . there was no difference in vehicle or gfp control rats between time points; however, fus rats developed significantly increased respiratory frequency at end stage . tidal volume represents the lung volume of air displaced with normal inhalation and exhalation in the absence of any extra effort and is then normalized to body weight. there was a significant effect of vector as well as an interaction between vector and time . there was no difference between pre-injection and 8 weeks in vehicle or gfp control rats, but tidal volume was significantly decreased at end stage in the fus rats . minute ventilation is the volume of air displaced over one minute and is the product of respiratory frequency and tidal volume, normalized to body weight. there was a significant effect of vector, a trend for significance of time, and an interaction between vector and time . minute ventilation at end stage in fus rats was increased . for inspiratory time, there was a significant effect of vector and time as well as an interaction between the two . for expiratory time, there was a significant effect of vector, a trend for significance of time, and an interaction between vector and time . total time, as expected, had significant effects of vector and time and an interaction between vector and time . inspiratory, expiratory, and total times all showed small but significant increases from pre-injection to 8 weeks for the vehicle group . this could suggest acclimation to the testing chamber. furthermore, it is not uncommon to observe normal changes in motor performance over time in controls  <cit> . however, this pattern was reversed in fus rats which exhibited decreased inspiratory and expiratory time , indicating impairment of normal respiration due to fus. the breathing abnormalities at end stage were clearly visible in the home cage as rapid, pulsatile hyperventilation.fig.  <dig> changes in respiratory parameters in fus rats over time. respiratory parameters studied include respiratory frequency , tidal volume , minute ventilation , inspiratory time , expiratory time , and total respiratory time . each fus rat is displayed as a separate black line, and the average values ± sem of vehicle and gfp animals are shown in orange and green respectively

tdp- <dig>  another rna-binding protein implicated in als and rna homeostasis, was tested for effects on plethysmography in a similar manner. four animals were administered aav <dig> tdp- <dig>  which all developed similar breathing changes as the fus group above. at end stage, measurements from tdp- <dig> animals indicated elevated respiratory frequency , reduced tidal volume , and increased minute ventilation , decreased inspiratory time , decreased expiratory time , and decreased total respiratory time . we did not record pre-injection baseline for the tdp- <dig> rats. we compared the end stage values from the tdp- <dig> rats with the 8 week time point values from the two control groups  by anova/bonferroni. the tdp- <dig> rats showed significantly increased respiratory frequency, reduced tidal volume, increased minute ventilation, and decreased inspiratory time, expiratory time, and total respiratory time compared to the controls . when comparing the tdp- <dig> group to the fus group at the end stage, there was a similar amplitude of effect of fus as tdp- <dig> gene transfer on respiration.

hypoxemia and acidosis accompany rapid breathing
due to the tachypnea seen in diseased rats, arterial ph and blood gases were evaluated at end stage as a measure of cardiopulmonary function in a small subset of animals . though preliminary, there appeared to be similar changes in both the fus and tdp- <dig> animals for the blood parameters measured. in the fus and tdp- <dig> animals, blood ph was below  <dig> , indicating acidosis, whereas none of the vehicle or gfp animals showed blood ph <  <dig> . the blood ph of the fus animals was significantly lower than the vehicle animals even with this small cohort size , and the blood ph of the tdp- <dig> animals was significantly lower than either the vehicle or gfp groups . some of the fus and tdp- <dig> animals also exhibited abnormally low blood oxygen saturation . the fus and tdp- <dig> animals had significantly lower oxygen saturation levels than either the vehicle or gfp groups . the fus animals showed below normal po <dig>  though not statistically significant, and the tdp- <dig> animals had statistically decreased po <dig> . pco <dig> appeared elevated relative to normal values  in some of the fus and tdp- <dig> animals though these measurements were not statistically different than controls. in contrast to fus and tdp- <dig>  gfp gene transfer did not alter blood ph, oxygen saturation, or po <dig> relative to the vehicle group.table  <dig> arterial blood ph and gases

fus and gfp transgene expression
we confirmed expression of fus from the fus dna construct in transfected cells . the construct expresses an untagged form of human fus. using a fus antibody that recognizes both rat and human fus, we were unable to clearly detect up-regulated fus expression in western blot samples of spinal cord, nor did we observe clearly increased immunohistochemical staining in the fus animals. thus, we can conclude that the level of fus overexpression was subtle, below a several fold overexpression. we know that less than two-fold overexpression of tdp- <dig> in the spinal cord is sufficient to induce paralysis  <cit> , so it is not surprising that low level fus overexpression could induce the phenotype.fig.  <dig> fus and gfp transgene expression. a transfection of the fus dna construct resulted in fus overexpression in hek293t cells at the expected molecular weight. b aav <dig> gfp expression in the lumbar spinal cord of a rat that received aav <dig> gfp 8 weeks earlier. gfp immunofluorescent staining is in b, smi  <dig>  a motor neuron marker antibody immunofluorescence is in c, and the merger is in d. the co-localization indicates gfp expression in motor neurons. bar in d is 134 μm




we have previously characterized the transgene expression pattern from aav <dig> gene delivery to adult rats with this promoter construct, which incorporates the cytomegalovirus/chicken beta-actin promoter and the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element   <cit> . in the cns, we can expect relatively robust expression in the spinal motor neurons, cerebellar purkinje cells, and dorsal root ganglia neurons. the transgenes are also expressed in the liver, heart, and muscle in this system. we believe that expression in the spinal cord is essential for the motor deficits because we have experimented with a promoter that expresses tdp- <dig> in liver but not the spinal cord, which does not produce the paralysis . furthermore, we know that if we apply aav <dig> tdp- <dig>  promoter as in this study) into the cerebral ventricles, we observe motor paralysis , so we believe the motor deficits are mediated in the cns. in contrast to fus, the gfp in the aav <dig> gfp group was easier to detect , presumably due to the lack of the endogenous protein and better signal-to-noise ratio. gfp was expressed in lumbar spinal motor neurons. there was co-localization of gfp and smi  <dig> immunoreactivity , which labels motor neurons .

discussion
these data establish a relevant and consistent disease modeling system in rats based on intravenous fus gene transfer for the first time. fus exerted disease relevant symptoms with an adult onset, at a small fold-overexpression  in the spinal cord. this adult model is relevant to adult onset diseases, like als, and provides an experimental system that is far more amenable to pre-treatment baseline data collection as well as different interventional schedules compared to modeling systems in which the fus expression begins earlier in development  <cit> . the fus gene transfer produced progressive paralysis and decreased grip strength in adult rats. plethysmographic analyses revealed rapid, shallow breathing in the fus rats at the end stage of the disease state which was characterized by dramatic increases in respiratory frequency coupled with significant decreases in tidal volume. although minute ventilation is the product of respiratory frequency and tidal volume, significant minute ventilation changes were observed due to the degree of increase in respiratory frequency. this breathing pattern can lead to hypercapnia due to ineffective gas exchange related to increased dead space. consistent with the theory of inefficient gas exchange, there was arterial blood acidosis and decreases in po <dig> and o <dig> saturation indicative of either pulmonary or diaphragmatic dysfunction. however, it is also possible that the hypoxia could have precipitated the rapid breathing. hyperventilatory responses to hypoxia are mediated by chemoreceptor reflexes of oxygen-sensing cells in the carotid bodies which activate peripheral axons of petrosal ganglion neurons  <cit> . these petrosal neurons project to the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem  <cit>  which integrates and transmits afferent chemosensory activity to respiratory neurons that regulate respiratory rate and volume. in addition to affecting spinal cord motor neurons which innervate the diaphragm, there are a few cases suggesting that als-related neurodegeneration may also progress to involve brainstem nuclei that control the integration and processing of respiratory signals which could lead to deleterious breathing irregularities  <cit> .

we observed transgene expression in spinal motor neurons in this study, but we can only hypothesize that fus expression in spinal motor neurons is what underlies the breathing changes. we attempted to evaluate phrenic motor neuron survival at the c <dig> region of the spinal cord to determine if the respiratory abnormalities seen were mediated in part by a loss of phrenic motor neurons, but we were limited due to technical issues. in addition to motor neurons, the effect could be mediated in the respiratory centers in the medulla or at the diaphragm muscle. more refinement of the expression pattern by altering the promoter, the type of aav, as well as the route of administration could better pinpoint the site of action. engineered aavs will be advantageous to achieve better transduction efficiencies and better targeting, for example, aav-php.b  <cit> .

we anticipated that the breathing measurements, due to their precise quantitative features, would provide a sensitive, early stage marker and detect subtle changes, but the breathing changes were severe and arose consistently after the onset of the limb paresis/paralysis. however, we were able to closely and quantitatively monitor the onset of end stage in the fus animals using plethysmography, in essence pinpointing the final stage in progression to death. motor and respiratory deficits induced by fus are relevant to als, and plethysmography offers a precise physiological readout to study treatments that may either delay or block the progression to end stage or conversely accelerate the time to end stage.

respiratory failure and complications is the most common cause of death in als, and respiratory ability is a predictive factor in survival . patients with als typically develop respiratory problems after the onset of paralysis, although in rare cases respiratory impairments can be the presenting symptom  <cit> . the fus rats followed the typical human sequence with motor abnormalities developing earlier than the respiratory abnormalities which appeared at the end stage. it is worth noting that the rapid, shallow breathing seen in the fus rats mimics reports of als patients with decreased tidal volumes and increased respiratory frequency  <cit> . interestingly, some similar relevant changes in breathing were also found in msod <dig> transgenic mice such as decreased tidal volume, although the msod <dig> mice developed slower respiratory frequency  <cit> . rats at end stage in this model showed blood acidosis which is relevant to both human als and the msod <dig> mouse model. blood acidosis seen in als patients has been shown to be related to poorer prognosis  <cit> , and transgenic msod <dig> mice show acidosis in the end and moribund stages of disease  <cit> . drugs that inhibit carbonic anhydrase, which regulates blood ph, have been shown to accelerate disease progression in msod <dig> mice  <cit> . this indicates that acidosis is not only a biomarker but also a potential contributor to the progression of disease. since blood ph was only evaluated at end stage, we were unable to determine if acidosis preceded the respiratory dysfunction. an interesting next step would be a long-term catheter for longitudinal blood ph and blood gas readings to test if the hypoxia precedes the rapid breathing. however, the catheter could certainly affect motor function  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
adult rats administered aav <dig> fus develop a consistent and als-relevant disease state including progressive motor paralysis and respiratory dysfunction. since both rna-binding proteins fus and tdp- <dig> caused similar changes in motor function  <cit>  and respiratory function, we hypothesize that both proteins exert similar or partial overlapping dysfunctions in rna metabolism  <cit>  that underlie the disease states. plethysmography provided a precise monitoring of progressive changes in breathing parameters in fus rats that are relevant to als and other als models. the relevant and consistent motor and respiratory symptoms may provide a useful pre-clinical model for therapeutic development as well as for studying underlying disease processes.
