BACKGROUND
public concerns about the consequences of the continued production of fuels and chemicals from fossil carbon sources have today led to intensive attempts to switch to the use of renewable carbon resources for future energy supply, such as lignocellulosic biomass from agricultural crop residues, grasses, wood and municipal solid waste. this affects not only the production of ethanol as a biofuel but also a range of key biochemical building blocks for biorefineries, including  <dig> -dicarboxy acids, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, levulinic acid, and polyols; to only name a few. thereby, the costs of cellulases and hemicellulases needed for hydrolysis of the plant biomass to soluble substrates contribute substantially to the price, and much cheaper sources of these enzymes are urgently required  <cit> . consequently, there has been a renaissance in studies aimed at understanding and improving cellulase efficiency and productivity.

trichoderma reesei , a fungus commonly found on decaying wood within a small latitude north and south of the equator, is a model fungus for cellulase and hemicellulase production  <cit> . unlike other industrial fungi, mutants were all derived from a single wild-type isolate  which was originally found during wwii on the solomon islands because of its ability to destroy cotton fabrics of the us army  <cit> . during the first oil crisis in the 1970s, t. reesei qm6a was found being the best cellulase producer in a large screen of tropical fungi contained in the us army quatermaster  culture collection  <cit> . random mutagenesis was then used to improve this strain and establish industrial production. in the attempt to understand the mechanisms of improvement in these strains, the genomes of some strains of these mutagenesis lineages  have recently been sequenced  <cit> . this led to the identification of a high number of mutated alleles, their causal involvement in enhanced cellulase production, however, still awaits verification  <cit> .figure  <dig> pedigree of the cellulase-negative strain qm <dig>  uv light and chemical mutagenesis programs of the natick  <cit>  and rutgers  <cit>  series lead to the selection of t. reesei strains with improved  or impaired  cellulase production. adapted with permission from  <cit> .



in the course of the earliest attempts to improve t. reesei qm6a by mutagenesis, the mutant strain qm <dig> was obtained that was unable to grow on cellulose and that did not form any cellulases on cellulose or any other inducer, such as lactose or sophorose, but otherwise displayed a normal phenotype  <cit> . the genetics underlying this cellulase-negative phenotype of this mutant are essentially unknown.

here we report the sequencing of the genome of the cellulase-negative t. reesei strain qm <dig>  we show that – among a few other mutations that likely are irrelevant to cellulase formation – this strain contains a frame-shift mutation in the major cellulase regulator gene xyr <dig>  <cit> , and that its cellulase production can be fully rescued by reintroduction of the wild-type xyr <dig> at its locus. we further show that this frame-shift mutation causes a  <dig> c-terminal amino acid truncation of xyr <dig>  which interferes with the positive auto-regulatory feedback mechanism required for de novo xyr <dig> biosynthesis, efficient nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity towards cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression.

RESULTS
identification of mutations in qm9136
the strain t. reesei qm <dig> has been isolated by a single round of x-ray mutagenesis using a linear particle accelerator from the wild type strain qm6a  <cit> , and was identified to be unable to produce cellulases  <cit> . phenotypically, colony growth of t. reesei qm <dig> on agar plates supplemented with either d-glucose, cellobiose or lactose was comparable to that of its parent t. reesei qm6a and the moderate cellulase producer qm <dig> . interestingly, the ability of qm <dig> to grow on cellulose is limited to cultivation on agar plates, and does not occur when the strain is grown in liquid culture. this phenomenon is not fully understood, but is shared with other cellulase deficient strains, including ∆xyr <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, in order to understand the origin of the cellulase-negative phenotype, we conducted whole genome comparisons between the natural isolate, the qm6a strain, and the mutant strain qm <dig> which we sequenced using high-throughput illumina sequencing. to get the complete picture of genetic modifications in that strain, this analysis included identification of the snvs , indels  and large structural variations . the final list of mutations identified in the strain qm <dig>  has been established from in silico analysis followed by an expert analysis . in total,  <dig> mutations have been detected: eight indels, six snvs and no structural variations. compared to the other mutant strains sequenced  <cit> , the number of mutations is much lower than that in t. reesei ng <dig> and rut c <dig>  but in the same order as in qm <dig> and qm <dig>  this could be due to the fact that strains ng <dig> and rut c <dig> were selected not only for cellulase hyperproduction but also for resistance against metabolic inhibitors  <cit> .table  <dig>

β- <dig> -n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . they were located on eight different scaffolds, and thus not clustered. nevertheless, it was intriguing to note that they were all located either in the 5′ or the 3′ fifth of the scaffold . in addition, all mutations occurred in a genomic region that is syntenic across t. reesei, t. virens and t. atroviride .

in silico analysis of the mutations in t. reesei qm <dig> identifies a truncation in the cellulase regulator xyr <dig> 

three snvs were present in the cdr of the following genes: the s-adenosylmethionine synthase sam <dig> ; a wd-repeat containing protein that has high similarity to the cell cycle regulator cdc <dig> , and the subgroup b chitinase chi18- <dig> . however, in the former two proteins these snvs only resulted in conserved amino acid changes . the change in chi18- <dig>  occurs within the c-terminal cbm1-type cellulose binding domain. however, this p is not conserved, and is substituted by g or c in cbm <dig> orthologues from other fungi  <cit> . we therefore consider it unlikely that this change significantly alters the functional properties of chi18- <dig> 

the five indels had a more dramatic effect: in the expansin-like protein trire2: <dig> and the gt <dig> β- <dig> -mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-β-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , each of the two single nucleotide losses occurred proximal to the n-terminus, and gave rise to a completely different or truncated protein sequence, respectively . as for the gene encoding the 24 kda subunit of the nadh-ubiquinone oxidoreductase , and a protein of unknown function , the loss of a t and a g, respectively, occurs in their promoters and the consequences of this change cannot be predicted.

consequences of the truncation on xyr <dig> structure
the most interesting mutation, however, occurred in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator xyr <dig> . the deletion of a <dig> in the spliced transcript leads to a frame-shift from t <dig> onwards that still encodes  <dig> amino acids  that are different to those in the native xyr <dig>  before the first premature amber stop codon eventually terminates translation . consequently,  <dig> c-terminal amino acids are absent resulting in the truncated xyr11– <dig> protein.

a pfam domain search  <cit>  identified two major functional domains in xyr1: the n-terminal zn2cys6-cluster involved in dna binding , and a fungal-specific transcription factor domain . using coils  <cit> , three coiled-coil regions were identified: one covering the zn2cys6-cluster and  <dig> amino acids c-terminal of it , one at the c-terminal end of the fstfd , and one at the c-terminal end of xyr <dig>  . this indicates that the truncation in qm <dig> starts after the fstfd. the missing amino acids have a composition with a bias towards acidic amino acids resulting in an isoelectric point of  <dig>  this domain thus likely resembles the acidic activation domain  that is an invariant part of zn2cys <dig> transcription factors  <cit> . an alignment of xyr <dig> orthologues from several pezizomycota shows that the missing c-terminus of xyr11– <dig> is otherwise highly conserved in all fungi . this suggests that these  <dig> c-terminal amino acids are important for the function of this protein. figure 2b shows a schematic domain comparison of full-length xyr <dig> and truncated xyr11– <dig>  template-based protein structure modelling of this acidic activation domain showed that it forms a bundle of helices of which the last four constitute the above mentioned coiled-coil domain .figure  <dig> xyr <dig> structure and structural consequences of the truncated xyr1– <dig>   predicted coiled-coil domains in xyr <dig> using coils, which compares a sequence to a database of known parallel two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score from which the probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil confirmation is calculated.  xyr <dig> contains a classical tri-partite nuclear localisation signal  which directs the transcription factor into the nucleus. xyr1’s dna-binding domain  is orthologous to that of gal <dig> from saccharomyces cerevisiae. the first coiled-coil domain of xyr <dig>  is located at the end of the dbd. the filamentous fungal-specific transcription factor domain  regulates target gene expression and constitutes the biggest part of the protein. a second coiled-coil domain  overlaps with the c-terminal end of the fstfd. the acidic activation domain  is a characteristic feature of zn2cys6-type transcription factors. the third coiled-coil domain  sits at the very c-terminus, and likely mediates homodimerisation of xyr <dig>  hence, the truncated xyr11– <dig> protein encoded in qm <dig> almost completely lacks the aad and fully lacks the third coiled-coil domain due to a frame-shift mutation from l <dig> onwards. the terminal  <dig> amino acids  encode a non-sense sequence that finds no blastp hit in the t. reesei genome.  3d-reconstruction of xyr <dig>  raptorx protein structure prediction software  identifies three functional domains in xyr <dig>  resembling dna-binding domain , fungal-specific transcription factor domain  and acidic-activation domain , perfectly matching our manual annotation . five of the seven α-helices comprising the aad are missing in the truncated xyr11– <dig> protein . the closest structural orthologs are the zn2cys6-type transcriptional regulators ppr <dig> and gal <dig> from s. cerevisiae, both known to be active as non-symmetrical homodimers  <cit> .



the overall protein stability  was determined to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  for xyr <dig> and xyr11– <dig>  respectively. while this suggests that the truncation does not impact structural stability compared to the full-length protein, it should be noted that both the native and the mutant xyr <dig> are classified as unstable, indicating a generally high protein turn-over rate as part of xyr1's cellular function.

introduction of native xyr <dig> into t. reesei qm <dig> rescues the mutant growth phenotype
the identification of a mutation in qm <dig> that truncates the xyr <dig> cellulase regulator protein led us to assume that this may be the major or exclusive mutation that gave rise to the cellulase-negative phenotype. in order to test this, we replaced the mutated xyr <dig> locus in t. reesei qm <dig> with a construct comprising a  <dig>  kb wild-type copy of xyr <dig> n-terminally linked to 717 bps encoding for green fluorescent protein , and flanked by  <dig> and 800 bps of its 5′ and 3′ utrs, respectively. we then grew all strains on 65 mm d-xylose as sole carbon source, which results in a compact colony phenotype in case xyr <dig> function is compromised. as shown in figure 3a and b, transformation with the gfp-xyr <dig> fusion gene fully restored the typical growth defective phenotype of xyr <dig> loss-of-function mutants on 65 mm d-xylose  <cit>  and matched the average colony extension speed as well as macroscopical morphology of t. reesei qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformed with the identical gfp-xyr <dig> construct .figure  <dig> gene replacement with full-length gfp-xyr <dig> construct rescues xyr1-loss-of-function phenotype of qm <dig>   qm9136::gfp-xyr <dig> transformants  grow on 65 mm d-xylose show colony extension speeds comparable to the moderate producer strain qm <dig> and qm9414::gfp-xyr <dig> transformants . qm <dig> and ∆xyr <dig> are sensitive to 65 mm d-xylose and display significantly reduced colony extension speeds.  macroscopic colony phenotypes of gfp-xyr <dig> transformants tral <dig> and tral <dig>  and control strains after 5 days on ma medium supplemented with 65 mm d-xylose. the xyr1-loss-of-function strains ∆xyr <dig> and qm <dig> develop a slower and less dense growing mycelium, however, start conidiation earlier, compared to the reference strain qm <dig>  expression of gfp-xyr <dig> restores wild type morphology in qm <dig> but does not alter qm <dig>   gene expression of the major cellulase cel7a, xylanase xyn <dig> and transcription factor xyr <dig> itself, induced by one hour exposure to  <dig>  mm sophorose, are restored in qm9136::gfp-xyr <dig> transformants . the xyr1-loss-of-function strains qm <dig> and ∆xyr <dig> show now transcriptional response to induction by sophorose. both cellulase-positive controls, qm <dig> and qm9414::gfp-xyr <dig> transformants  respond as expected with upregulated cel7a, xyn <dig> and xyr <dig> expression. error bars show standard deviations .



to test whether nuclear import of gfp-xyr <dig> in a qm <dig> background is also sufficient to restore cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression, we performed correlated gene expression analysis on mycelia from liquid cultures induced by  <dig>  mm sophorose. the rescued qm <dig> transformants indeed, expressed the major cellulase cellobiohydrolase i gene cel7a  at levels comparable to strain qm <dig> after one hour of induction with sophorose. no cellulase gene expression was observed in qm <dig> or the ∆xyr <dig> mutant strain cultivated under identical conditions . consistent data were obtained for the xylanase ii-encoding gene xyn <dig>  hence confirming earlier data  <cit>  that qm <dig> is also deficient in hemicellulase formation . while the experimental error inherent in these analyses cannot completely exclude that one of the other mutations detected  would contribute to a very minor extent  to the cellulase-negative phenotype, we conclude that the mutation in xyr <dig> has the most significant impact on qm9136′s inability to produce cellulases and hemicellulases.

a genetically engineered xyr1∆a <dig> allele reproduces the qm <dig> mutant phenotype in t. reesei qm9414
the above data imply that the c-terminal  <dig> amino acids are essential for the function of xyr <dig>  in order to test this directly, we replaced the wild type xyr <dig> locus in t. reesei qm <dig> with the corresponding xyr1∆a <dig> allele containing the truncating mutation. the resulting transformants  showed the same growth defect on d-xylose and macroscopic mutant phenotype as found in qm <dig> .figure  <dig> gene replacement with the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> reproduced the xyr1-loss-of-function phenotype in qm <dig>   qm9414::gfp-xyr11– <dig> transformants  showed the same growth defect on 65 mm d-xylose as qm <dig> and ∆xyr <dig>  respectively, indicating loss of xyr <dig> function, which was further verified by the corresponding macroscopic colony phenotypes, shown in .  gene expression of cellulase cel7a, xylanase xyn <dig> and xyr <dig> were not significantly upregulated in gfp-xyr11– <dig> expressing transformants , whereas the gfp-xyr <dig> transformants  clearly responded to the inductive stimulus provided by sophorose. error bars show standard deviation .



in addition, cellulase and xylanase gene expression was impaired in t. reesei expressing gfp-xyr1∆a <dig> . expression of the gene encoding cel7a after 1 h induction with sophorose, for instance, was 60-times lower when the truncated xyr <dig> version was present. xyr <dig> expression, on the other hand, was only 6-times less in the mutant with truncated xyr <dig>  we therefore conclude that presence of the genetically engineered, truncated xyr11– <dig> is sufficient to reproduce the qm <dig> mutant phenotype.

full-length xyr <dig> is transported into the nucleus in t. reesei qm9136
the loss of a conserved domain in a transcription factor can have three main consequences:  impaired stability and degradation;  lack of transport into the nucleus; and  lack of interaction with other factors responsible for enabling expression of the respective target proteins. binding to dna was not investigated because of the intactness of the zn2cys <dig> zinc finger of xyr <dig> in strain qm <dig> 

in order to test  and , we employed n-terminal gfp-tagging of xyr <dig>  and performed quantitative live-cell imaging analyses under cellulase inducing and non-inducing conditions. the necessity of an n-terminal gfp fusion, and the basic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling dynamics of xyr <dig> during cellulase and xylanase expression have previously been established by us  <cit> . as can be seen in figure 5a and b, the dynamics of nuclear recruitment of gfp-xyr <dig> in response to the presence of the inducer sophorose, were indistinguishable in qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformants.figure  <dig> nuclear import of gfp-xyr <dig> is indistinguishable in qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformants.  sophorose-induced nuclear import of gfp-xyr <dig> in qm <dig> and qm <dig> backgrounds was indistinguishable. relative fluorescence intensity represents the average gfp-xyr <dig> signal detected measured in  <dig> nuclei per sample. the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio  provides a measure of how much brighter the average gfp-xyr <dig> signal is inside nuclei compared to the surrounding cytoplasm. error bars represent standard deviation .  representative, inverted fluorescence images showing increasing gfp-xyr <dig> recruitment into nuclei of t. reesei germlings over a time course of 60 min after carbon source replacement with  <dig>  mm sophorose.



because reliable antibodies directed against xyr <dig> are currently not available, we furthermore took advantage of the gfp-tag to detect gfp-xyr <dig> by western blot analysis, and confirmed that the high turn-over dynamics of the transcription factor previously observed in qm <dig>  <cit> , are conserved in the complemented qm <dig> transformant, verifying functional rescue . summarizing, these data show that the cellular machinery required for nuclear import of xyr <dig> is generally intact in qm <dig> figure  <dig> western blot analysis of gfp-xyr <dig> and gfp-xyr11– <dig> under cellulase inducing conditions. top row: coomassie stained loading control; middle row: chemifluorescent image of western blot membrane; bottom row: x-ray image of western blot membrane.  with time , less of the 127 kda full-length gfp-xyr <dig> but more of its various 30-70 kda degradation products  can be detected in protein extracts. this rapid turn-over of the transcription factor is conserved in qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformants.  in comparison to full-length gfp-xyr <dig>  expressed in qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformants, of the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> construct, only ~80 kda or smaller degradation products could be detected . 5-30 μg refer to the total protein load per lane; numbers on the side denote molecular weight ranges; m <dig> is pageruler pre-stained molecular weight marker; m <dig> is supersignal enhanced protein ladder; 18 h qm6a gfp is the positive control, and 18 h qm <dig> the negative control for αgfp antibody specificity.



the truncated xyr11– <dig> protein is also transported into the nucleus
we consequently tested whether the mutated xyr1∆a <dig> present in qm <dig> would be expressed, and - if so – whether the resulting xyr11– <dig> is transported into the nucleus. to this end, we again took advantage of gfp-labelling, and studied the intracellular localization dynamics of the gfp-xyr11– <dig> construct with which we had replaced the native xyr <dig> in t. reesei qm <dig> .

nuclear import of truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> in response to an inductive signal was strongly decreased as compared to the full-length gfp-xyr <dig>  nevertheless, still occurred at a low level. in comparison to the full-length construct which increased eight-fold within 60 minutes after replacement on sophorose, nuclear gfp-xyr11– <dig> recruitment increased only three-fold, reaching just 13% of the average gfp-xyr <dig> concentration . the inability of truncated xyr <dig> to adequately respond to an inducing signal was observed on all tested inductive carbon sources, and indirectly correlated with the efficacy of induction . western blot analysis showed that in contrast to qm <dig> and qm <dig> transformants, in which full-length gfp-xyr <dig>  was readily detectable after 1 h of sophorose induction, only ≤ 80 kda large degradation products of the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig>  could be detected . this finding suggests that the truncated xyr <dig> protein undergoes proteasomal degradation much faster than the full length version, probably because it is quickly detected as non-functional.figure  <dig> c-terminal truncation renders gfp-xyr11– <dig> non-responsive to inductive signals.  nuclear recruitment dynamics assessed by quantitative live-cell imaging. in contrast to the full-length gfp-xyr <dig> , whose concentration in nuclei rapidly increased by a factor of up to eight-fold, the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig>  was unable to significantly increase its presence in the nucleus in response to cellulase- and xylanase-inducing carbon sources . instead, gfp-xyr11– <dig> consistently showed nuclear presence comparable to the basal presence of gfp-xyr <dig> under xyr1-non-inducing conditions . error bars show standard deviation .  representative, inverted fluorescence images showing nuclear import of gfp-xyr <dig> and gfp-xyr11– <dig> after one hour of sophorose induction. in contrast to the full-length gfp-xyr <dig> construct, the truncated version is barely visible inside nuclei before induction . most importantly, upon addition of  <dig>  mm sophorose, the nuclear signal of gfp-xyr11– <dig> does increase, however, only to a fraction of the intensity  of the gfp-xyr <dig> construct under identical conditions. scale bar, 10 μm.



basal xyr <dig> formation is unaffected by the xyr1∆a <dig> mutation
despite the strong reduction of the degree and rate of nuclear uptake in the strain harbouring the xyr1∆a <dig> allele, the cytosolic level of the truncated xyr <dig> remained low but comparable to that in the parental strain . in order to rule out that this would be an artefact caused by autofluorescence of t. reesei, we repeated these experiments under microscope settings optimized to completely eliminate cellular background auto-fluorescence detection . under these stringent detection settings, any fluorescence signal must emanate from gfp only. as shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  the fluorescence intensity of cytosolic gfp-xyr11– <dig> was the same under xyr <dig> inducing and non-inducing conditions , and was also similar to that measured in t. reesei qm <dig> expressing the fully functional gfp-xyr <dig>  interestingly, in this experiment we detected gfp-xyr11– <dig> in small cellular spots under inducing conditions, which we hypothesize might be clusters of proteasomal degradation leaving the more stable n-terminal gfp behind. this is in line with our previously reported finding, that the gfp moiety of the fusion protein remains longer inside nuclei than the much more rapidly degraded xyr <dig> part  <cit> . summarizing, we conclude that basal expression of xyr <dig> is not affected by the c-terminal truncation of xyr11– <dig> present in t. reesei qm <dig> 

impaired nuclear recruitment of xyr11– <dig> occurs throughout the whole fungal colony
the results documented in figure  <dig> illustrate that the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> is indeed transported into the nucleus at the same rate as the full length gfp-xyr <dig>  albeit the ratio of nuclear-to-cytoplasmic accumulation was reduced by > 75%. as these experiments were conducted with germinating liquid cultures, we wondered whether this reduction in gfp-xyr11– <dig> biosynthesis and nuclear import would also occur throughout the mature fungal colony – i.e. in the colony periphery comprised of fast growing hyphae, the colony subperiphery which displays prolific hyphal branching, and the central area of the colony which is additionally characterized by aerial hyphae formation and prolific sporulation. we have recently shown that the central region of the colony was the one with the highest nuclear concentration of xyr <dig>  <cit> .

strains expressing the full-length gfp-xyr <dig> behaved as expected: strong nuclear recruitment of xyr <dig> with a clear intensity peak in the colony centre on xyr1-inducing carbon sources, and essentially the same profile but with about 10-times weaker peak intensities on xyr1-non-inducing carbon sources . the strain expressing the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> on the other hand, showed low-intensity profiles independent of the used carbon source. notably, the overall amounts of gfp-xyr11– <dig> on any carbon source tested were comparable to those of gfp-xyr <dig> under non-inducing conditions, suggesting that the induction-independent baseline production of gfp-xyr11– <dig> functioned normally, however, was unresponsive to inducing signals. this was in line with data collected in shuttling experiments using conidial germlings in liquid culture. taken together these results suggest, that c-terminal truncation of xyr <dig> prevents any xyr1-dependent cellular response, independent of the used carbon source, the developmental age of the fungus, i.e. germling vs. mature colony, or the functionally stratified colony region.figure  <dig> quantification of nuclear recruitment of gfp-xyr <dig> and gfp-xyr11– <dig> in the three main functional zones of the mature colony. all strains were grown for 48 hours on ma medium agar plates supplemented with the indicated carbon source.  full-length gfp-xyr <dig> responds to different xyr1-inducing signals with nuclear recruitment, most prominently in the central area of the colony, and dependent on the inductive strength of the provided carbon source  cellulose). under non-inducing/repressing conditions  only weak baseline nuclear recruitment can be detected. in contrast, the truncated gfp-xyr11– <dig> does not significantly respond to cellulase induction, and hence can only be detected at baseline levels independent of the provided carbon source.  representative, inverted fluorescence images of the tested conditions, showing that gfp-xyr11– <dig> does respond to 25 mm lactose with weak but detectable nuclear import, comparable to the baseline presence of gfp-xyr <dig> under repressing conditions . on 50 mm d-glucose gfp-xyr11– <dig> is visible in small spots, suggesting degradation of the non-functional xyr <dig> construct in the proteasome.



discussion
historically, the cloning of genes was based on the use of complementation of mutants, which favored those organisms which either contained plasmids or autonomously replicating elements  or which could efficiently be crossed in the laboratory. although a number of substitute strategies had been developed , this nevertheless strongly limited the progress in organisms that exhibited neither of these possibilities, such as the so-called imperfect fungi. the advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics have now made it possible to sequence even full eukaryotic genomes quickly, and to use this strategy to identify mutations responsible for a particular phenotype  <cit> . however, since mutant organisms often contain several mutations , most researchers either mapped the target mutation or backcrossed their mutant against the wild type, and sequenced more than one mutant genome simultaneously.

since the t. reesei mutants were maintained asexually, neither of these two strategies was possible for the present study. hence, we were fortunate that the cellulase-negative strain qm <dig> only exhibited eight mutations, of which several could be characterized as unlikely candidates for this phenotype. in accordance with the fact that t. reesei qm <dig> arose from x-ray treatment , which predominantly gives rise to elimination of nucleotides, we found a higher number of indels than snvs. vitikainen et al.  <cit>  made the same observation for the t. reesei strains qm <dig> and qm <dig>  which arose also by x-ray treatment  <cit> , whereas the t. reesei ng <dig> and rut c <dig>  which were isolated by uv light-treatment  <cit> , exhibited a higher number of snvs  <cit> . we found no bias in the occurrence of the mutations in the genome, as all eight occurred on different scaffolds. yet it was intriguing to note that all but one were located at the ends of the scaffolds, and five of them occurred at scaffolds of <  <dig> mbp size. since the size of the scaffolds is determined by the presence of long and non-alignable nucleotide repeat regions, it is possible that the proximity to regions of genomic instability facilitates the susceptibility to mutation by x-rays.

using gene complementation, we showed that a truncation in xyr <dig>  caused by a single nucleotide deletion, is very likely the exclusive reason for the cellulase-negative phenotype of t. reesei qm <dig>  xyr <dig> is the main actor among at least four positive transcriptional activators , because its knock-out not only eliminates cellulases but also xylanase and ß-mannanase formation . this finding is also nicely reflected in the phenotype of qm <dig>  which fails to grow on 65 mm d-xylose , has strongly reduced or no growth on lactose and cellulose, respectively,   <cit> , and is deficient in the formation of cellulases, xylanases and mannanases  <cit> .

while the identification of a gene  that is already known to be crucially involved in cellulase and hemicellulase formation, as the cause for the inability of cellulase formation of t. reesei qm <dig>  may be considered trivial, it nevertheless sheds new light into its molecular function: xyr <dig> belongs to the fungal-specific zn2cys6-binuclear zinc cluster transcription factor family  <cit> . the highly conserved domain structure of this protein family contains – besides the zinc cluster domain recognizing the nucleotide binding motif – a fungal transcription factor regulating middle homology domain , and short acidic activation domains within the distal portion of the c-terminus. with regard to xyr <dig>  these domains have not yet been clearly located  <cit> . in this study, we have delimited these domains and consequently presented evidence that the xyr <dig> truncation in t. reesei qm <dig> exclusively removed the c-terminal acidic activation domain. this implies that this domain is essential for the activation of cellulase, xylanase and ß-mannanase gene expression. in fact, two mutations in the xyr <dig> ortholog xlnr from a. niger  are also located in the acidic c-terminal region and also resulted in an impairment of xylanase gene expression  <cit> . we therefore conclude that this region is essential for binding the proteins or other compounds that mediate induction of cellulase and hemicellulase formation in t. reesei. interestingly, the above mutations lie within the four short helices that form the c-terminal coiled-coil. in the arabidopsis thaliana tcp <dig> zn2cys6-type transcription factor this coiled-coil acts both as a transactivation and self-assembly domain  <cit> . since the nucleotide motif that binds xyr <dig> has in most cases been described to only function in vivo when present as a direct or indirect repeat  <cit> , we hypothesize that xyr <dig> has to form a dimer. a mutation in or absence of this coiled-coil domain therefore may impair binding of xyr <dig>  and thus cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression.

interestingly, two mutations have been reported in the n-terminal part of the acidic activation domain that result in the opposite, i.e. constitutive expression of xylanases in a. niger and t. reesei and elevated basal expression of cellulases in t. reesei only. these are v756f in xlnr  and a804v  in xyr <dig>  <cit> . since truncation of xyr <dig> in qm <dig> starts before both positions, this implies that the above mutations are only functional when the whole acidic activation domain is present. one model that would explain these findings is that v <dig> and a <dig> are binding a repressor of xylanase induction, which is antagonized by binding of the proposed activator. according to derntl et al.  <cit> , induction of cellulase gene expression is not altered, but their basal expression level is increased. in t. reesei, the cellulase genes cel7a and cel6a as well as the xylanase genes xyn <dig> and xyn <dig> are regulated by carbon catabolite repression mainly at the basal transcription level  <cit> . it would thus be tempting to speculate that v <dig> and a <dig> are necessary to bind the respective catabolite repression regulator cre <dig>  <cit> , whose dna-binding sites in the above genes are in close vicinity to those for xyr <dig>  <cit> . however, the strain of derntl et al.  <cit> , in which this increase of the basal level of cellulase transcription has initially been detected, is a derivate of t. reesei rut c <dig> which bears a nonfunctional cre <dig> copy  <cit> . the nature of the repressor binding at v <dig> and a <dig> would thus need to be identified first.

we have previously shown that xyr <dig> is transcribed at a low level constitutively, but its expression is enhanced in the presence of one of the known cellulase or xylanase inducers  <cit> . this constitutive low concentration of xyr <dig> is already transported into the nucleus, and we could show here that this also occurs in the qm <dig> mutant. we therefore conclude that the c-terminal acidic domain does not contain a trigger for nuclear transport. these findings are generally in accordance with those of hasper et al.  <cit>  who found that truncation of a c-terminal region of a. niger xlnr including the coiled-coil of the fungal transcription factor activation domain  leads to lower but still clearly detectable nuclear localization. however, in contrast to the truncation in xlnr, the truncated xyr <dig> in qm <dig> still bears an intact ftfad-terminal coiled-coil region. our data therefore suggest that the putative regulatory c-terminus of xyr <dig> is not per se required for nuclear import of the transcription factor, but rather appears to be involved in its induction-dependent, positive auto-regulatory feedback mechanism. this explains why the fluorescent intensity of the truncated xyr <dig> protein stays generally low because the protein cannot be upregulated by its own production and achieve sufficient nuclear accumulation to trigger cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates how high-throughput genomic sequencing combined with reverse genetics can provide novel functional insights into organisms that are otherwise only poorly susceptible to mutational analyses. the mutation in xyr <dig> in t. reesei qm <dig> also allowed new insights into the function of this central cellulase regulator. the ongoing investigation of yet two more cellulase-negative strains of t. reesei  – which bear a functional xyr <dig> copy  – by a similar approach is expected to further elucidate cellulase and hemicellulase regulation in this important filamentous fungus.
