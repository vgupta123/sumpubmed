BACKGROUND
juxtacrine signalling mechanisms, specifically cell-extracellular matrix  interactions and gap junctional intercellular communication , act in concert to influence developmental specification of neural stem and progenitor cells . the interaction of laminins with α1β <dig> integrin receptors segregates proliferating units in the embryonic ventricular zone from migrating units in the overlying cortex  <cit>  while gjic within these ecm-defined boundaries ensures synchronous cellular activity between cells destined to become functional domains  <cit> . similarly, the interaction of laminin with receptors containing β <dig> integrin directs radial migration of proliferating neuroblasts from the embryonic ventricular zone and along the adult rostral migratory pathway  <cit>  while the presence of gap junction connexin proteins facilitates migration of neuroblasts along the axial processes of their radial glial guides during cortical lamination  <cit> . thus, available data suggest that ecm and connexin-mediated signalling systems act synergistically to direct npc specialization and migration.

gap junction communication occurs through intercellular channels formed by connexins  <cit> . oligomerization of six connexins forms a hemichannel  when inserted into non-junctional plasma membranes  <cit> . connexons allow for the regulated passage of ions and small molecules  between the cytoplasm and the extracellular space  <cit> . alignment and docking of two connexons in adjacent cells creates an intercellular channel enabling direct cell-cell communication and possibly adhesion. clusters of intercellular channels make up the morphologically defined gap junction  <cit> . there are  <dig> different connexin proteins in mouse;  <dig> in humans  <cit> . fourteen  are detected in embryonic and/or adult central nervous system  <cit>  but only select connexin combinations are capable of oligomerization, adhesion, and functional communication.

the impact of ecm components upon connexin expression in npcs has not been tested. this is an important issue because npcs are routinely expanded as neurospheres in the absence of exogenous ecm while functional assessment of cell-cell signalling pathways often involves replating on adhesive substrates. understanding the changes in npc phenotype in 2d and 3d culture systems is necessary if we are to rigorously test and validate potential strategies involving npc expansion and specification in vitro  <cit> . it has already been demonstrated, in other cell types, that connexin expression and intercellular communication is strongly influenced by laminin-integrin interactions  <cit> . in this study, we sought to identify the connexins intrinsically expressed by postnatal npc populations and determine whether exposure to laminin or simple adhesion alters connexin expression and connexin-mediated gjic and/or hemichannel activity. we show that subsets of npcs exhibit a unique connexin profile and that this profile is altered by laminin but not poly-l-lysine impacting upon functional channel activity.

RESULTS
ecm effects on postnatal npc culture
to characterize neurosphere composition, we analysed marker expression in suspension and in cultures plated on a variety of adhesive substrates by immunofluorescence . although each neurosphere is likely derived from a single npc, progeny spontaneously adopt distinct developmental lineages in culture . we found neurospheres cultured in the absence of exogenous ecm were primarily composed of nestin+ cells . cells co-expressing the type  <dig> npc marker gfap localized to the periphery of neurospheres . type 2a cells expressing nestin only were found in the core of cultures . dcx+, ncam+, and tuj1+ neuroblasts and immature neurons were detected in clusters throughout the neurosphere structure . ng2+ and pdgfαr+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  and rip+ oligodendrocytes were found at the periphery of neurospheres with rare cells detected in the core . when cultures were plated on laminin, we observed a significant increase in the percentage of cells that retained a nestin+ npc identity and a significant decrease in the percentage of cells that specified to neuroblasts, immature neurons, and/or opcs . no change in the number of astrocytes was detected but a small increase in rip+ oligodendrocytes was observed in laminin-plated cultures .

intrinsic connexin mrna expression
to identify the connexins expressed by postnatal progenitor cells in the absence of exogenous ecm we performed rt-pcr. fourteen connexins  are expressed in the mammalian cns  <cit> . transcripts for ten of these connexins  were detected in neurosphere culture . cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> expression was further confirmed by analysis of the reporter gene products present in null-mutant lines. in cx29-/- and cx30-/- mice, the lacz open reading frame replaces the connexin coding sequences  <cit>  whereas a bicistronic reporter cassette containing lacz, an internal ribosome entry site, and placental alkaline phosphatase replaces the connexin coding sequence in cx36-/- mice  <cit> . β-galactosidase expression was readily detected in neurosphere cultures from these three null-mutant lines .

differential expression of connexins in subsets of npcs
we used immunofluorescence to localize connexins to npc subtypes grown in the absence of exogenous laminin . for all connexins except cx <dig>  cultures from null-mutant mice served as negative controls to ensure antibody specificity. for cx <dig>  where deletion is embryonic lethal  <cit> , antibody specificity was determined by western blot . four distinct connexin protein profiles were detected:

 cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  were expressed by the majority of cells  throughout the structure of the sphere. punctate membrane-associated immunoreactivity characteristic of gap junction labelling was evident in nestin+ and gfap+ cells . we used flow cytometry to quantify cx <dig> expression in nestin+/gfap+ type  <dig> npcs, nestin+ type 2a npcs, and gfap+ astrocytes . we found that all of the type  <dig> npcs  and the vast majority of type 2a npcs  expressed cx <dig>  surprisingly, few if any committed astrocytes were cx30+  . these results were further substantiated by triple-labelling for cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and gfap . cx <dig> but not cx <dig> was detected in all gfap+ cell types suggesting ubiquitous localization of cx <dig> in gfap+ npcs and astroglia but a more restricted distribution of cx <dig> to subsets of multipotential type  <dig> gfap+ npcs.

 cx <dig> , cx <dig> , cx <dig> , and cx <dig>  were expressed in a minority of cells  localizing to both the sphere core and periphery in the absence of laminin. cx <dig> and cx <dig> exhibited membrane-associated staining but rarely in apposition with neighbouring cells expressing the same connexin . cx <dig> localized to nestin+ and gfap+ type  <dig> npcs  at the periphery of the sphere and nestin+ type 2a npcs within the core  as well as gfap+/nestin- astrocytes . cx <dig> localized to pdgfαr+ opcs . cx <dig> and cx <dig> labelling appeared to be largely intracellular  suggesting these connexins are not forming gap junction channels at the plasma membrane. both cx <dig> and cx <dig> were expressed primarily by nestin+ type 2a cells .

 cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  were expressed by rare cells  restricted primarily to the periphery of neurospheres cultured in the absence of laminin. these connexins were often expressed in adjoining cells  where contiguous labelling was detected at the plasma membrane . cx <dig> localized to nestin+ type 2a npcs  and was not detected in gfap+ cells . cx <dig> expression was restricted to rip+ oligodendrocytes .

 both cx <dig> and cx <dig> were detected at the mrna level  but no immunodetection of protein was observed . antibody efficacy was confirmed by western analysis .

exposure to exogenous laminin substrate alters npc expression of most connexins
to assess the effect of ecm on connexin expression, npcs were expanded for  <dig> div in suspension before plating on laminin-coated glass coverslips . cultures exposed to laminin rapidly adhered to the ecm substrate. cells at the periphery of the neurosphere migrated from the core as adherent monolayers over  <dig> div. fewer cx43+  and cx40+ cells  and no cx45+  or cx47+  cells were observed when npcs were cultured on laminin substrate. laminin increased the number of cx26+ cells  and induced cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  protein. cx32+ cells exhibited small nuclei  and were immunopositive for the opc marker ng <dig> . cx <dig> was expressed in refractile cells with neuritic extensions  and were immunoreactive for the neuronal marker tuj1-βiii tubulin . although exposure to the ecm substrate did not alter the percentage of cells expressing cx <dig> , a change in subcellular localization was observed. immunoreactivity was markedly less punctate  with protein detected throughout the cytosol of laminin-treated cultures . contact with laminin did not change the number of cells expressing cx <dig> , cx <dig> , or cx <dig> .

an alternative explanation for these changes lies in the mechanical impact of npc plating to an adhesive substrate  <cit> . to test this, we plated neurospheres on poly-l-lysine, laminin, or a matrigel mixture containing the following ecm components  and assessed cx <dig> expression . the same reduction in cx43-expressing cells was observed following engagement with matrigel as plating on laminin alone. plating on poly-l-lysine had no effect on cx <dig> expression. taken together, these data provide converging evidence for a laminin-specific regulation of connexin expression as compared to a physico-mechanical influence of culture condition.

impact of laminin-induced changes in connexin expression on cell-cell and hemichannel communication
transmembrane flux of the low molecular mass fluorescent dye, ly, was used to assess hemichannel activity in neurosphere cultures. rd was used to control for uptake resulting from plasma membrane damage. hemichannel opening was induced by mechanical stimulation with glass microbeads as previously described  <cit> . cultures were expanded in suspension for  <dig> div, then plated and analyzed immediately after adherence  prior to any detectable change in connexin protein expression  or after  <dig> div in contact with laminin  following the observed changes in connexin expression . mechanical stimulation elicited a significant increase in dye uptake on div  <dig>  that was largely inhibited by the dual-specificity chloride channel and connexin/pannexin-channel blocker ffa  <cit>  but not the chloride channel inhibitor dids . hemichannel activity was lost when npcs were cultured on laminin for  <dig> div . we cannot, however, rule out that these changes are due to an effect of ecm on pannexin channel formation as we have determined that npcs cultured in suspension express both pannexin  <dig> and  <dig> mrna  yet we have not investigated impact of laminin on this expression at the protein level.

biochemical coupling indicative of gjic was assessed by scrape loading. little to no dye transfer was observed on div  <dig> or div  <dig> . these data were surprising given the ubiquitous cx <dig> and cx <dig> expression detected in the majority of cells prior to laminin engagement. as a positive control, we differentiated npcs to a predominantly nestin-/gfap+ astrocytic lineage . robust gjic was detected in these cultures and was inhibited by gap junction channel blocker gra but not its inactive analog gza . to provide mechanistic insight into the lack of ly transfer in npc cultures, we assessed cx <dig> phosphorylation status and found, in neurospheres cultured without laminin, that the p <dig>  p <dig>  and hyperphosphorylated forms of cx <dig> predominated . previous studies have indicated that the degree of ly dye coupling is inversely correlated with phosphorylation state  <cit>  suggesting that post-translation modification of cx <dig> in npc cultures may account for this lack of dye transfer. taken together, these data indicate that postnatal npc cultures do not establish gap junctions permeable to ly, but do exhibit hemichannel activity that is suppressed upon exposure to laminin.

discussion
our data indicate hippocampal-derived postnatal progenitor cells express a broad array of connexin genes and that connexin expression, intracellular distribution, and channel activity are regulated by ecm-cell interactions. when cultured as neurospheres in the absence of exogenous ecm, postnatal npcs express cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and/or cx <dig> mrna and protein as well as cx <dig> and/or cx <dig> mrna. exposure to a laminin substrate markedly increases the number of cx26+ cells present in culture and elicits the appearance of cx <dig> and cx <dig> protein. conversely, laminin treatment decreases the frequency of cx40+, cx43+, and cx45+ cells without impacting on the number of cx29+, cx30+, or cx37+ npcs. surprisingly, we found that, while postnatal npc cultures exhibit hemichannel activity, they do not transfer ly, a well-established hallmark of junctional communication, until differentiated to a mature astroglial lineage. the lack of dye transfer is likely the result of post-translational modification of the connexin proteins, specifically cx <dig>  further, hemichannel activity is suppressed by plating on laminin. together, these findings suggest a new role for ecm-cell interaction, specifically laminin, in the regulation of intrinsic connexin expression and function in postnatal npc cultures. this regulation may predispose postnatal npcs toward channel-independent connexin communication as recently demonstrated in the developing cns wherein channel-independent connexin adhesion influences the migration of newly born neurons along radial glia  <cit> .

localization of connexins to discrete subsets of postnatal hippocampal progenitor cells
the repertoire of connexins identified here is much larger than that reported by wörsdöfer et al.,  <cit>  who demonstrated expression of seven connexin transcripts but protein for only cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  however, these studies used ecm components and not suspension-grown neurospheres. furthermore, they used embryonic stem  cells rather than postnatal npcs. thus, the differences in connexin expression patterns likely reflect the unique connexin signature of the different stem and progenitor cell populations present in these cultures as well as the impact of ecm adhesion on connexin expression. here, we show that type  <dig> and type 2a multipotential npcs express cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig>  cx <dig> and cx <dig> have been previously observed in embryonic npc populations  <cit>  but this is the first demonstration that cx <dig>  exclusively expressed postnatally  <cit> , is also expressed by multipotential type  <dig> npcs. we found that progression to a type 2a lineage is associated with de novo cx <dig>  cx <dig>  and cx <dig> protein expression. further commitment to an oligodendrocyte lineage is accompanied by the loss of all of the connexins identified in multipotential npcs and de novo expression of connexins associated with mature oligodendrocytes   <cit> . surprisingly, cx <dig> transcript but not protein was detected in opcs and oligodendroglia in the absence of laminin. the presence of cx <dig> transcript but not protein is also observed in es cells  <cit>  with unknown consequence on cell fate. taken together, these data provide evidence of intrinsic connexin signatures expressed by progenitor cell subsets over the course of commitment in vitro.

effect of laminin on connexin expression and function
exposure of npcs to a laminin substrate altered connexin protein expression and/or stability, intracellular distribution, and functional channel activity. the simplest explanation for these changes is that this profile mirrors the effect of laminin on the differentiation of npcs. plating of npcs on ecm is known to alter the rate of spontaneous specification and survival of embryonic stem cell cultures  <cit> . indeed, we found more cells retained a multipotential type 1/ <dig> phenotype in laminin-treated cultures than those expanded in the absence of laminin. an alternative explanation is a direct effect of laminin/integrin signalling on the regulation of connexin protein expression or stability in npcs. certainly, laminin has been shown to alter connexin expression and function in other cell types  <cit> . the consequence of these changes have only begun to be appreciated. in cns, the recent finding that gap junctional plaques formed by cx <dig> or cx <dig> are required for migration of neuronal progenitors along radial glial cells during cortical development in the mouse  <cit>  suggests that ecm regulation of connexin expression is involved in cortical lamination and thus is likely to influence postnatal npc migration. this hypothesis represents an unexplored role for ecm-connexin interactions in vivo.

the changes in connexin profile detected in the presence of laminin are not restricted to npcs. opc and neuronal profiles are also altered. cx <dig> and cx <dig> protein, not observed in the absence of exogenous ecm, are present following laminin engagement. cx <dig> null-mutation has previously been shown to delay terminal differentiation of ng2+ opcs in adult hippocampus  <cit> . here, we find that the induction of cx <dig> protein in ng2+ opcs by laminin is associated with a moderate increase in the frequency of rip+ oligodendrocytes suggesting enhanced oligodendrogenesis. surprisingly, these new oligodendrocytes did not express cx <dig> in the presence of laminin suggesting that perhaps different functional subset of cells are generated. recent studies indicate that cx <dig> and cx <dig> do not oligomerize and do not form the same heterotypic intercellular channels taken as evidence for functional differences between these connexins and perhaps between subsets of oligodendrocytes  <cit> . finally, the induction of cx <dig> protein in tuj1+ neurons in the face of reduced neurogenesis was equally surprising. this observation may recapitulate the changes observed between early and late phases of embryonic neurogenesis. cx <dig> mrna is initially detected in multipotential neural stem cells during early but not late neurogenesis where expression is restricted to their neuronal progeny  <cit> . it may be that the functional changes in channel activity observed following engagement of neurosphere cultures with laminin regulate npc and opc commitment.

at no point did we detect cell-cell coupling with respect to the passage of the anionic dye ly. while surprising given that embryonic progenitor populations are coupled during early neurogenesis  <cit>  our data agree with the findings of duval et al. who demonstrated gjic in astrocytes but not in other npc-derived cells  <cit> . here, we show passage of ly only when npc cultures are induced to differentiate towards a primarily astroglial lineage and likely corresponds with a shift in the phosphorylation status of cx <dig>  conversely, robust transmembrane dye flux indicative of functional hemichannel activity is evident prior to ecm-induced changes in connexin protein profiles. laminin engagement suppresses this activity. it is tempting to speculate that connexin -mediated hemichannel activity promotes specification whereas channel-independent adhesion supports the migration through ecm-defined domains in postnatal hippocampus. however, care must be taken in directly extrapolating our results to the in vivo situation given the complex three dimensional character of the developing hippocampus where many different matrices and cellular scaffolds are present given evidence of different cell phenotypes within 2d and 3d culture systems  <cit> . clearly, it will be important to establish the impact of ecm control of connexin protein expression on postnatal npc proliferation, migration, and specification in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified the repertoire of connexins expressed by postnatal hippocampal npcs over the course of commitment in vivo. we have demonstrated that ecm engagement, more specifically laminin, can alter not only the fate of cultured postnatal hippocampal npcs, but also their connexin expression profile and related channel function. taken together, these data suggest that ecm control of connexin expression and signalling may play a role in the direction of multipotential npcs towards a neuronal or glial lineage.
