BACKGROUND
many organisms of major importance in economy and health of human populations are non-model organisms and thus lack efficient genetic resources that could be used to speed up and facilitate the work of research groups throughout the world. however, the advent of next generation sequencing , by decreasing sequencing costs of a factor  <dig>   <cit> , provided the opportunity to sequence the genomes of new organisms  at different stages of completion. in general, obtaining complete genome sequences for a given organism is immediately followed by the computational and manual annotation of its gene catalog. genes, in the sense of protein-coding genes, are the major focus of most genome sequencing consortia. thus, obtaining first a complete transcriptome for an organism, might, in most cases, cover the needs of a specific scientific community. furthermore, obtaining a good quality reference transcriptome as a first step of a genome sequence project could prove immensely beneficial for gene prediction and annotation.

the lepidoptera spodoptera frugiperda  is an intensely studied organism, yet lacking a comprehensive genomic resource. s. frugiperda, also known as the fall army worm  is a noctuid moth, classified as a major crop pest by usda, inra and other national agronomic agencies. in the united states and in brazil, it is a threat to corn but is also found devastating cotton, sorghum and other grass-like crops such as rice  <cit> . its area of distribution concerns almost the entirety of the american continent  <cit> , thus much work has been devoted to study the biology of this insect. in order to improve the tools at our disposal to efficiently understand the biology of s. frugiperda, we report here the generation of an ngs-based sequencing of rna libraries obtained from a large variety and number of tissues and developmental time-points. these libraries have been assembled together in a reference transcriptome, dubbed sf_tr2012b, comprising around  <dig>  sequences available for search through a dedicated database. we further used the sf_tr2012b assembly to annotate several gene families and study their expression profile. we focused especially on the genes involved in immunity and in olfaction. we validated some of our developmental genes predictions by qpcr to demonstrate that in sf_tr2012b, some regulated transcripts without clear orthology are bona fide functional genes in s. frugiperda.

RESULTS
construction of a reference transcriptome
the reference transcriptome presented here is named sf_tr2012b. we incorporated various sources of rna sequences from  <dig>  illumina and sanger sequencing and had to develop a custom pipeline. this assembly is described in details in the methods section and illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  its assembly has been performed by the software mira  <cit>  and incorporated various sources of rna sequences obtained from a laboratory strain of s. frugiperda. the main source of rna molecules has been obtained by  <dig> rnaseq of a library containing cdna extracted from  <dig> different samples  comprising  <dig> developmental time-points samples  and  <dig> dissected tissues , in order to cover the majority of the mrna produced by the faw. first these  <dig> sequences have been assembled in ~ <dig>  different clusters, referred to in here, as sf_gatc_clusters . in a subsequent assembly step , sf_gatc_clusters have been used as input, as well as  <dig> rna samples , sequenced using the illumina technology  <cit> . a collection of expressed sequence tags , previously described and available through spodobase   <cit> , was also included in the final assembly. the final sf_tr2012b assembly comprises ~ <dig>  sequences for a total of ~37 m nt .table  <dig>

statistics of the sf_tr2012b transcriptome assembly compared to
d. melanogaster
and
b. mori


the data for d. melanogaster has been downloaded from flybase  while the data from b. mori has been downloaded from silkdb . in d. melanogaster, all transcripts correspond to the latest version of transcript annotation coming from gene prediction and manual curation. b. mori dataset has been generated by assembling a collection of ~ <dig>  ests, giving two reference points for different transcriptomic strategies.



evaluation of the sf_tr2012b assembly
first, we wanted to evaluate whether the last step of assembly, combining the short reads with the long reads sequences, was improving the quality of our transcriptome. we evaluated this improvement by aligning independent illumina libraries on the different reference transcriptome assemblies using the bowtie software  <cit> . we used  <dig> .fastq files containing sequences for whole larvae rna extracted in experimental conditions, which were unrelated to our transcriptome project , to align the reads against sf_tr2012b and sf_gatc_clusters. for all  <dig> samples, the average of unmapped reads is around 20% when aligned on both assemblies  . however we greatly improved the percentage of uniquely mapped reads from 22% to 45% while decreasing the number of multiple reads from 58% to 32% . this indicates that our second step of assembly was particularly effective at eliminating most of the redundancy that one could expect from an organism that is far from being isogenic.figure  <dig> 
content of the reference transcriptome. a. barplot representing the percentages of multiple hit reads, unmapped reads and uniquely mapped reads, as provided by bowtie, when aligning an rnaseq library against either the sf_454_clusters assembly or the sf_tr2012b assembly. the percentages obtained are the average of four independent experiments. b. pie chart representing the number and percentage of contigs from sf_tr2012b grouped by their best blastx hit against nr. number of contigs and percentage of the total are represented. c. synthetic table representing the number of genes found per family in the sf_tr2012b assembly. the number of full and partial transcripts for hox-domain proteins is irrelevant because the only conserved part is the homeodomain itself.



then, we wanted compare our approach with other insects datasets for which the transcriptome was obtained differently. we thus compared the number of contigs  and the total size  of the sf_tr2012b assembly with  <dig> other insect models, drosophila melanogaster and bombyx mori. the drosophila melanogaster transcriptome contains more than  <dig>  sequences for a total length of 81 m nt . the drosophila transcripts set is built primarily from computer predictions of the genome sequence and also from permanent curations due to the large drosophila research community and more than a hundred years of genetics research on this model. due to the conservation of the majority of genes between insects, we should expect a “complete” transcriptome to come close to this number. a standard approach to construct a reference transcriptome is sanger sequencing of an est library. we can find an example of this in public repositories for bombyx mori. we can see that the total size of this assembly is around 11 mb  because of the assembly of sanger sequences in unigenes.then, we seeked to have a better view of the total content of the sf_tr2012b assembly by performing systematic blastx against nr  to checked whether our rna sequences were corresponding to bona fide proteins and also to checked whether we had some contaminants.  <dig>   of the contigs were matching eukaryotic proteins. of those,  <dig>   contigs are similar to a heliconius protein , while  <dig>  heliconius proteins  are similar to a tr2012b contig.

similarly,  <dig>   contigs are similar to a monarch protein , while  <dig>  danaus plexippus  proteins are similar to a tr2012b contig. both comparisons have been made using blastx with a threshold of 1e- <dig>  without complexity filter.

we found only  <dig> contigs  matched prokaryotes , making large scale contaminations of our samples highly improbable. what was more surprising was that  <dig> % of our rna sequences didn’t match any known protein sequences. among these  <dig>  sequences without hit against the nr databank,  <dig> include at least one protein domain found with the following algorithms . these comparisons have been done using interproscan  directly on the transcript sequences. this low number of hit does not necessarily reflect that the other sequences are spurious, but they may derived from utr, or the predicted orf  might be uncompleted or the sequences may contain a frameshift. this is enhanced by the observation that the transcripts without hit are shorter than the transcripts with hits . finally, some of the transcripts without any match against nr databank might correspond to lncrna, as well as transcribed repeat elements.

for the sequences matching eukaryota, we performed blastx against eukaryotic core gene sets such as the cegma  geneset  and the busco proteins set . we found that  <dig> among  <dig> cegma proteins  are similar to  <dig> sf_tr2012b contigs. similarly  <dig> among  <dig> busco drosophila proteins  and  <dig> among the  <dig> busco danaus plexippus proteins  were present in the sf_tr2012b assembly, suggesting that the core components of the faw transcriptome were present in our assembly.

assessment of sf_tr2012b quality and usability through gene families annotation
in order to evaluate the proportion of genes present/absent from our reference transcriptome, we manually annotated different families of genes. ribosomal proteins  are mostly conserved among eukaryota and are present as highly expressed small genes throughout most genomes. thus the percentage of rbp found should be indicative of the minimal requirement for finding most housekeeping genes. we used a set of  <dig> proteins annotated as rbp in b. mori   and searched for homologs in sf_tr2012b. out of those  <dig> sequences, we could find  <dig> hits matching the complete b. mori transcript. for  <dig> rbp, we found only partial matches . thus, we conclude that more than 90% of housekeeping genes are represented in sf_tr2012b assembly.

conversely, we searched for more constrained genes belonging to  <dig> functional families : homeobox-domain genes , odorant and pheromone-binding proteins and immune related genes. hox proteins can be identified with certainty thanks to the conserved signature of their homeodomains even between distantly related species  <cit> . within species however, many paralogs can be identified. contrary to the ribosomal proteins, the expression of genes encoding hox proteins in d. melanogaster is usually temporally and spatially restricted. thus we expected these particular proteins to be more difficult to find in our assembled transcriptome due to their underrepresentation in the rna samples collected, compared to other abundant transcripts such as ribosomal proteins. we used a collection of  <dig> d. melanogaster homeodomain protein sequences from the homeodomain resource database  <cit>  as a tblastn query of our sf_tr2012b transcriptome assembly.  <dig>  unique drosophila homeodomain orthologs were thus detected .

similarly, we used a set of chemosensory genes previously identified by transcriptome sequencing in the closely related species s. littoralis, the cotton leaf worm , and that comprises both highly expressed  and low expressed  genes. found in abundance in the olfactory organs, obps and csps are proposed to transport odorants to membrane bound receptors  <cit> . two families of volatile molecule receptors have been described in insects, the olfactory receptors  and the ionotropic receptors , these two types being involved in the recognition of different volatile families as demonstrated in d. melanogaster
 <cit> . co-receptors highly conserved among species are required for these receptor functioning: orco  is required to form with ors heterodimers while ir25a and ir8a are proposed to complex with irs  <cit> . we used a set of  <dig> chemosensory genes  previously identified in s. littoralis to search for homologs in the s. frugiperda reference transcriptome.  <dig>  of the highly expressed transcripts  were recovered whereas we could recover only  <dig> out of  <dig> s. littoralis low expressed chemosensory receptors transcripts  . interestingly, we could identify  <dig> putative new chemosensory transcripts, bearing the hallmark signal peptide but with no ortholog in s. littoralis, encompassing  <dig> obps,  <dig> csps and one ir). the numbers of obps and csps annotated in s. frugiperda,  is within the range of the numbers of obps and csps usually annotated in lepidoptera genomes, e.g. in b. mori
 <cit> . only partial sets of ors and irs could be identified compared to the numbers of such genes annotated in either s. littoralis or b. mori
 <cit> , certainly because of their low expression level. accordingly, we found many frameshifts and inappropriate stop codons in the predicted ors. however, the three co-receptors orco, ir25a and ir8a could all be annotated in s. frugiperda. this reflects their high expression levels due to their function as co-receptors.

finally, we tried to annotate most of the immune-related genes of faw using sf_tr2012b. the invertebrate immune response has been extensively studied in insects and today it is in the insect model, d. melanogaster, that we have the most integrated understanding of this physiological function. indeed, biochemical, genetic and molecular biology approaches have led to the characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in  pathogen recognition and extra-cellular signaling,  signal transduction through intra-cellular signaling pathways, and  pathogen elimination through the production of effectors molecules and cell activation . we inventoried the components of s. frugiperda immune repertoire by comparing sf_tr2012b with the immune repertoire described for d. melanogaster and other insects  and classified them in three groups . the first one contains transcripts encoding proteins involved in pathogen recognition as well as extracellular molecules associated to signal transduction. the second group contains proteins belonging to intra cellular signaling pathways which control among others the antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral responses and that also play a key role in developmental processes . the third group contains an inventory of effectors of the immune response . as summarized in figure  <dig>  we were able to identify in s. frugiperda transcriptome most of the components involved in the drosophila immune response . two of the missing components were located on the toll pathway. the first one, grass is a serine protease involved in the activation of spätzle processing enzyme. grass belongs to a large family of clip domain containing proteases. in sf_tr2012b, we identified  <dig> such proteases while  <dig> and  <dig> were found in the genomes of b. mori and d. melanogaster, respectively. therefore, even though grass might be one of them, we were not able to identify it with certainty. the second one is the dorsal-related immunity factor, dif, which, to our knowledge, was characterized only in diptera. three components of the imd pathway, the inhibitor of kinase kinase gamma also known as kenny in drosophila, the caspase dredd and the negative regulatory factor pirk were not found. the last missing component is the cytokine upd <dig>  an activator of the jak/stat pathway which was also characterized only in diptera.figure  <dig>

thanks to these four points of comparison, we think on one hand our current assembly is sufficiently deep to uncover most genes of s. frugiperda. they are usually complete sequences if they have a high level of expression. but on the other hand, we might have missed around 70% of the rarest transcripts. altogether, the sf_tr2012b assembly seems perfectly adequate in order to identify a large part of the coding sequences of s. frugiperda.

access to sf_tr2012b through lepidodb
the sf_tr2012b assembly sequences can be downloaded through the lepidodb database  . in this database, the transcripts can be queried with their identifier or with the name of an ortholog. blastx against the nr database have been performed for all transcripts in the assembly and the database contain the best  <dig> results for each transcript. blast searches can also be performed from the database. in addition a gbrowse system has been added that presents a set  <dig> bac sequences  representing each around 100 kb of contiguous genomic sequence, on which a computed gene prediction has been performed by kaikogaas . we aligned the sf_tr2012b transcripts on this genomic reference  <cit> . the alignment results by blast have been converted into a .gff <dig> file directly viewable in a gbrowse genomic viewer instance  <cit>  hosted through the lepidodb portal  . throughout the bacs, we have  <dig> % of kaikogaas gene predictions that overlap with an sf_tr2012b transcript, while  <dig> % of sf_tr2012b overlap with a gene prediction . we also provide for each transcript its level of expression for  <dig> different samples. these levels of expression are also represented on the bacs present in lepidodb as tracks   <cit> .figure  <dig>

measure of transcripts expression by rnaseq
we were interested in using the reference transcriptome to study families of genes involved in larval development, in chemosensory reception and in immune response. these categories of genes are all necessary to the adaptation of the feeding larva to its environment, whether be its host plant or its panoply of pathogens. specifically we were interested in investigating the repertoire of genes and their level of expression for each of these categories. thus, we extracted total rna corresponding to  <dig> developmental time-points and  <dig> experimental dissected tissues to generate a quantitative gene expression dataset by illumina sequencing . total rna has been extracted from the selected samples and sequenced to produce 10 m single-end 50 bp reads , representing approximately  <dig> × coverage of each nucleotide in the reference transcriptome. levels of expression for each gene in sf_tr2012b have been measured by  <dig> indices: total coverage, reads per million , normalized reads count using limma  <cit>  or normalization of reads count using deseq  <cit> . these four tables of expression are available for download on the homepage of lepidodb . we calculated the correlation coefficient  between pairwise samples  and noted that there was much more correlation between l <dig> early and l <dig> early stages and between l <dig> late and l <dig> late than between both l <dig> stages or between both l <dig> stages, indicating that different transcripts expression profiles were defining the beginning and the end of each ecdysis cycle. interestingly, the l <dig> late time-point was not correlated with the other larval time-points, probably reflecting the onset of metamorphosis. less variation was observed between tracheae, antennae and palps and fat body samples, all coming from late larval stages.to identify the genes specific to each of the samples, we used a k-mean clustering method , to group together genes with similar expression profiles. we empirically chose  <dig> as the number of k-mean clusters that was producing categories with enough differences between them. we immediately noticed that one category  comprised most of the transcripts . this category had a mean expression level of close to  <dig> rpm. this probably represents most of the rare transcripts coming from the large amount of samples that we dissected and included in our  <dig> sequencing assembly, in addition to the set of ests previously described. the cluster  <dig>  similarly, had a large number  of transcripts with low expression and no noticeable specific expression profile. however, most of the other clusters identified groups of genes whose expression was specific of one or two samples . to test whether those clusters made sense, we checked to which clusters rbp and hox proteins belonged. compared to the overall distribution of transcripts in the different clusters, rbp proteins are enriched in clusters  <dig> , <dig> , <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> . except for clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  all the other clusters show a median level of expression that is high in all samples, even if this level varies from sample to sample. hox transcripts however are enriched in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> . the cluster  <dig> in particular corresponds to genes that have a higher level of expression during embryonic stages compared to any of the other samples, which makes sense given that hox-domain genes are often transcription factors involved in embryogenesis.figure  <dig>

common and specific developmental genes
when designing the reference transcriptome, we emphasized the production of  <dig> developmental time-points specific rna libraries to be sequenced by illumina. we were interested in the specificity of development of s. frugiperda compared to other insects. indeed, s. frugiperda is a pest in its larval stage and resistance to common pesticides has become a particularly prevalent issue  <cit> . we reasoned that identifying developmental genes specific to s. frugiperda would provide the community with specific targets for the development of new strategies of pest control. to identify genes involved in the embryonic development of s. frugiperda, we focused on the comparison of  <dig> illumina rnaseq libraries sequenced from eggs and l <dig> stage larvae rna extracts. we used the r framework package deseq to identify genes that are overexpressed in eggs and no longer in l <dig> and that are thus required only during embryonic development.  <dig> genes have been identified with a striking pattern of embryo only expression . we randomly selected  <dig> candidates from this list to confirm by quantitative pcr that our candidates correspond to genes that are effectively transcribed in s. frugiperda and are effectively transcribed in a regulatory fashion . we also chose  <dig> negative controls with high expression at all stages  and an rbp protein  with non detectable expression at all stages. 15/ <dig> tested had a significantly higher expression in embryos than in l <dig> larvae in qpcr . in addition, we observed that our differential expression measurements by rnaseq and by qpcr are linearly correlated . while some of the genes we selected are well known in other organisms to regulate development , we also included genes for which no clear orthology was detected. these transcripts, such as joint2_rep_c <dig>  joint2_rep_c <dig> and joint2_rep_c <dig> might represent lepidoptera specific embryonic genes important for embryonic development, which makes them interesting targets for the development of new pest control strategies.figure  <dig>

expression of the genes of olfaction
both antennae and maxillary palps house olfactory neurons that detect odorant volatile molecules via different steps, each involving a specific family of proteins. as expected for proteins involved in olfaction, most of the obps and csps are highly expressed in antennae and palps . interestingly, while most of the obps expression was not visible when entire animals were used for rna extraction , many csp transcripts could still be highly visible in different samples, suggesting that their expression is not restricted to the olfactory organs. this correlates well with some evidences that csp function would not be restricted to olfaction  <cit>  and that these proteins would act in fact as general carriers of hydrophobic molecules throughout the insect body. interestingly, the expression of some ors was not restricted to the olfactory organs and several could be observed as expressed in the fat body or the midgut . such ectopic expression has been already described for some ors in insects, for instance in b. mori abdmonen  <cit>  and gut  <cit>  and in s. littoralis abdomen and brain  <cit> , although the function of ors in such organs is still unknown. ir25a showed a broad expression, as already observed in s. littoralis
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

expression of the genes of immunity
analyses of immune genes expression in the different development stages or tissues are in agreement with what is commonly described in the literature. for instance, induced fat body  strongly expressed genes encoding amps . on the other hand, surprisingly, antennae and palps  also strongly expressed genes encoding amps. interestingly, some amps genes are expressed in fb and a/p whereas others seem to be preferentially expressed in only one of the two “tissues”. what is the most remarkable is that some amps genes  are less expressed in bacterial challenged fb than in unchallenged a/p, suggesting that those tissues develop a constitutive immune response.

thanks to high-throughput sequencing of antennal transcriptomes, this phenomenon has recently been observed in other lepidoptera, in diptera  and in some hymenoptera like the leaf-cutter ant in which most of the immune genes are highly expressed in the antenna of the queen ant  <cit> . those observations raise the question of the interplay between immune and gustatory/olfactory systems. one may wonder if expression of immune genes in gustatory/olfactory systems is a bona fide immune response or is somehow involved in nutritional strategies like food selection.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we provide in this study a reference transcriptome for s. frugiperda, available through a dedicated database, along with measures of differential expression across  <dig> different samples. we found this resource invaluable to annotate and study the expression of different families of genes. in particular, we were able to identify and validate lepidoptera specific genes involved in development. we also analyzed a set of genes involved in olfaction across two spodoptera species. and finally, we annotated an almost complete set of immune related genes and observed in particular that some anti-microbial peptides are highly expressed in chemosensory organs, even in absence of induction, raising the possibility that antennae and palps can naturally act as primary organs of immune response, since they are in open contact with the natural environment.
