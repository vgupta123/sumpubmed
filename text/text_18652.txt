BACKGROUND
terrestrial plants face serious abiotic stresses , these are the predominant cause of decreased crop yields  <cit> . being one of the major oil crops worldwide, glycine max faces these challenges posed by environmental stressors. to cope with environmental stresses, crops have evolved sophisticated adaptive response mechanisms  <cit> . therefore, unraveling the complex resistant mechanisms of soybeans will provide fundamental insights into the biological processes involved in environmental stimuli, which may prove helpful in alleviating crop losses.

there is increasing evidence that micrornas , ~ <dig> nucleotides  in length, act as key factors in gene regulation, developmental processes and stress tolerance in plants  <cit> . mirnas function by either cleaving their targets  or repressing protein translation  <cit> . indeed, it has been suggested that a number of mirnas that participate in stress responses have adapted to environmental challenges. for example, phillips et al.  <cit>  reported that mir <dig>  mir397b, and mir <dig> are involved in stress response. expression levels of mir <dig> changed under salinity and alkaline stresses, however, over-expression of mir <dig> is harmful to plants  <cit> . in response to environmental stresses, fluctuations in the expression of mirnas can be induced by many uncontrolled factors, such as drought, salinity, and alkalinity at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. it was reported that sulfate starvation lead to the up-regulation of mirna <dig>  <cit>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were responded to water deficiency  <cit> . furthermore, these inducible mirnas display different specificity under different stresses. however, our knowledge of the roles played by mirnas under stress conditions in plants is still limited, especially at the whole-genome level.

in recent years, it has been possible to identify mirnas through either bioinformatics or sequencing. for instance, various methods have been used to identify mirnas in rice, wheat, and maize  <cit> . many bioinformatics approaches and technologies have been developed for rapid and accurate mirna detection and analysis. recently, deep sequencing technology is showing significant promise for small rna discovery and genome wide transcriptome analysis at single-base pair resolution  <cit> . in comparison with microarray, deep sequencing has several advantages, the major one being its application in comprehensively identifying and profiling small rna populations that were previously unknown. deep sequencing has identified many small rnas in different plants, mutants, and tissues at various developmental stages  <cit> . in this study, soybean mirnas associated with stress response were identified and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. one hundred and thirty three known mirnas corresponding to  <dig> mirna families were detected in soybeans under three stress treatments. in addition,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many mirnas are inducible and are differentially expressed during different environmental stresses.

RESULTS
general features of small rna transcriptomes under diverse treatments
small rnas were documented not only to modulate a series of complex developmental events, but also to regulate defense under abiotic stress  <cit> . to explore the small rna pools from three stress treatments in soybeans , rna libraries were generated and sequenced by solexa . more than  <dig> million original sequencing tags were produced with approximately 9- <dig> million raw reads from each library. after discarding low quality, filtering 5' contaminant and trimming 3' adaptor reads, a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> clean reads were obtained from mock, drought, salinity and alkalinity treated datasets, respectively . although the total numbers of sequence reads in four rna libraries were similar, the size distribution of sequence tags was substantially different . for example,  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>  sequences are canonical  <dig> nt small rnas with the most abundant small rnas in the roots of mock samples. while  <dig>  <dig>  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  <dig> and  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> reads of  <dig> nt were in the three stressed libraries, accounting for  <dig> % of clean reads from drought,  <dig> % of clean reads from salinity and  <dig> % of clean reads from alkalinity, respectively. small rnas varied widely in length and redundancy, the  <dig> nt reads showed the highest redundancies  in the salinity induced library. the  <dig> nt reads constitute  <dig> % and  <dig> % in drought and mock libraries, while they only account for  <dig> % in the alkalinity induced library. the relatively lower percentage of  <dig> nt reads indicates that more kinds of mirnas are involved in the response of g. max to alkalinity compared with other stress conditions. these data highlight the overall complexity of the small rna repertoire under different stress conditions.

it is essential to generate a reference set of annotations for exploring the small rna categories. all identical solexa reads in each library were sorted into unique sequence tags for further analysis. when aligned, all sequences were read against the glycine max genome using soap <dig>  <cit> , about 70% of reads matched perfectly and 30% were from un-annotated genome sites with one mismatch. for instance, in the mock,  <dig> , <dig>  clean reads that grouped into  <dig> , <dig> unique reads were matched to the  <dig>  <dig> mb genome of glycine max. subsequently, for each library approximately 60% of clean small rnas were identified as products processed from rrnas, trnas, snrnas, or other non-coding rnas . another fraction  was predominantly derived from un-annotated or repeated sequences. large portions of annotated small rnas were mainly non-coding rnas. for the mock group,  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> clean sequences which were classified into  <dig>  unique tags were considered to be potential mirnas. the other two induced by drought and salinity were  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig> , respectively. notably, in the alkalinity-induced group,  <dig>  screened reads  were mirna candidates, accounting for nearly half of mirnas of the former three groups. it is estimated that known mirnas might be the most abundant class of small rnas regulated at post-transcriptional levels in plant defense.

known mirnas in soybean
many mirnas of the soybean have been reported in previous studies. kulcheski et al.  <cit>  detected  <dig> mirnas from drought-sensitive and tolerant seedlings and rust-susceptible and resistant soybeans, of which  <dig> families of mirnas had not been reported before. song et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> new mirnas in developing soybean seeds by deep sequencing. joshi  <cit>  identified  <dig> mirnas based on sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, among which,  <dig> mirnas matched known mirnas in soybean or other species, while  <dig> were novel mirnas. in another study chen et al.  <cit> , reported  <dig> conserved mirna candidates belonging to eight different families and nine novel mirna candidates comprising eight families in wild soybean seedlings. to identify known mirnas from the soybean in four diverse treatments, small rna sequences were compared with mirbase  <dig> . after a sequence similarity search,  <dig> known mirnas corresponding to  <dig> mirna families were identified in the soybean . in addition, four conserved star mirnas  have also been sequenced. among them, mir156d*, mir157b*, and mir3630* star sequence expressions were rather low. however, the abundance of mir162* ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> reads under different treatments. in addition, other star mirnas expression levels were low under all four conditions, these were mir172b*, mir156h*, and mir166g*. other studies showed that mirnas are often evolutionarily conserved throughout the plants  <cit> . hence, we investigated the evolutionary conservation features of the identified mirnas in soybean by comparing them to arabidopsis thaliana, rice, zea mays, medicago truncatula, sorghum bicolor, triticum aestivum, vitis vinifera, brassica and pinus according to their sequence similarity . the identified mirna families are conserved in a variety of plant species. one hundred and ten mirna genes were reported in glycine max, the other  <dig> genes were detected from known orthologous mirnas.

the sequencing frequencies for mirnas in our four libraries were used as an index for estimating the relative abundance of  <dig> mirnas. the distribution patterns of mirna frequencies varied greatly, indicating that these mirnas were expressed ubiquitously in each library. three abundant mirna reads  occupied  <dig> % of expressed mirna tags on average . the identified mirna families are conserved in a variety of plant species in our study. for example, families of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are widely conserved in  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> species, respectively . most mature mirnas identified in the soybean were also detected in other plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , grapevine  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . especially those present in high abundance, such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  of these, mir <dig> was the most abundant . previous studies revealed that mirnas with high expression levels always correlate with evolutionary conservation  <cit> . in this study, the majority of mirnas occurring at low frequencies, with no more than  <dig> read tags, such as mir <dig> and mir <dig>  showed poor conservation. nevertheless, the mirnas with the least sequence reads, including mir169g, mir171b, and mir393b, were sequenced dozens of times but were conserved in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> plant species, respectively . mir171b expressed in the mock and mir393b expressed in drought were sequenced  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively. these observations suggest that conserved mirnas may be essential for controlling basic cellular and developmental pathways  in plants.

to validate the expression pattern of mirnas by deep sequencing, we randomly selected ten mirnas  to perform verification by qrt-pcr. expression abundance patterns in three stress  induced samples were compared with the mock. up-regulated mirnas under three stress-induced conditions, which occurred most frequently with both methods, were mir167d, mir169d, mir <dig>  mir1507a, mir1508b and mir <dig>  only mir393a had shown to be not in accordance with solexa result. mir394a was down-regulated and exhibited an identical pattern in both methods. these highly concordant results between two methods suggest qrt-pcr validation indicated a good concordance of both methods .

novel mirnas in soybean
from the four small rna libraries,  <dig> mirnas were revealed as possible mirna candidates of soybean. to support the existence of the novel mirnas, their hairpin structures and free energies were used to evaluate these candidate mirnas. we identified  <dig> novel mirnas, with the  <dig> most highly expressed candidates listed in table  <dig>  and the others in additional file  <dig>  the energy scope of these mirnas ranged from  <dig>  kcal/mol  to - <dig>  kcal/mol . the expression levels of these candidates ranged broadly, from thousands of sequence counts to single sequence counts. most mature sequences were products of a step-loop structure at both 5' and 3' mediated by dicer-like enzymes. novel mirnas, including gma-m <dig>  gma-m <dig>  gma-m <dig>  gma-m <dig>  and gma-m <dig>  were identified at both the 3' and 5' ends of hairpins. the 5' read tags displayed very small read counts compared with 3' tags. gma-m <dig>  gma-m <dig>  gma-m <dig>  and gma-m <dig> showed nearly equal numbers of sequence reads originating from both arms of the mirna precursors. eleven mirnas, including gma-m <dig>  had a higher number of sequence reads originating from the 5' arm than the annotated mature mirna containing 3' arm, suggesting that the majority of mirna genes processed by dcl have a strand bias in plants.

in comparison with these conserved mirnas, all the novel mirna tags had low read counts in the four libraries, where the highest is only  <dig>  <dig> at 5' end . the least is only one at 3' and 5' end , and the average read count was  <dig>  it is well known that conserved mirnas are highly expressed frequently and ubiquitously whereas non-conserved mirnas are not. further experimentation is needed to determine whether these novel mirnas are stress induced.

mirnas expression patterns under drought, salinity, and alkalinity
to gain deep insight into environmental adaptation of soybean, we studied common and unique mirna expression patterns under drought, salinity, and alkalinity conditions. as shown in figure  <dig>  mirna expression varied in response to different stress-inducing conditions. these genes were identified as functional regulation factors in the resistance of stress. the mirna expression profiles observed revealed that a small portion of mirnas  exhibited stress-specific expression patterns. moreover, all of the three mirnas have low expression abundance. substantial portions of the mirnas were expressed under two or three stress conditions. for example, mir156d*, mir160a, mir394a, mir1520j, mir <dig>  mir4387a, mir <dig>  mir1520c, and mir1520r appeared in three stress conditions while mir169g, mir <dig>  and mir3630* appeared in two stress conditions. therefore, some mirna expressing intermediate counts  and others had only several reads .

the vast majority of the differentially expressed mirnas showed different expression patterns either among three conditions or between two stress conditions. of these, the expression of  <dig> mirnas was significantly different  , these were congruously or differentially regulated under the three stress conditions. in three stress conditions,  <dig> mirnas  were all up-regulated in comparison to the mock. for example, the expression level of mir <dig> changed  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  folds in drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively. fifty-one mirnas showed different trends under various inducing conditions , indicating that individual mirnas may have distinctive expression patterns under different stress conditions. for example, mir394a was up-regulated in drought  but down-regulated in salinity . under different conditions,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated with a fold change >  <dig> , and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were down-regulated with fold changes > - <dig>  in drought, salinity and alkalinity, respectively. the expression profiles strongly indicate that different mirna regulation patterns might completely or partly contribute to explaining the stress regulation between various treatments.

mirna targets prediction
investigation of the target mrnas of the mirnas identified can assist us in understanding their biological roles  <cit> . in a previous study, katara et al.  <cit> , predicted  <dig> targets for  <dig> of the  <dig> mature mirna sequences published in the database. study of affected proteins revealed that more of the target protein products were involved in diverse physiological processes e.g. photosynthesis  <cit> . joshi  <cit>  predicted the putative target genes of  <dig> identified mirnas with computational methods and verified the predicted cleavage sites in vivo for a subset of these targets using the 5' race method. in addition, the authors also studied the relationship between the abundance of mirna and that of the respective target genes by comparing their results to solexa cdna sequencing data. in the study of song et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> were identified as targets of  <dig> known mirnas and  <dig> new mirnas and  <dig> genes. go analysis indicated that many of the identified mirna targets may function in soybean seed development to understand the relationship between the soybean the mirnas identified in the four treatments with previously published mrnas, we utilized the psrnatarget program for predicting mrna targets of mirnas.  <dig>  <dig> mrnas were predicted to be targets for  <dig> mirnas . finally,  <dig> genes were classified into  <dig> types annotated by cog . the function of most mrnas is translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis, and signal transduction mechanisms. furthermore, a variety of biological functions are involved in nucleotide transport and metabolism, transcription, defense mechanisms etc, which will provide useful information about the regulatory roles of mirnas for different tolerances. these results demonstrate that the majority of targets fall into the category of transcriptional regulation, indicating that these targets encode transcription factors . some mirnas, such as gma-mir156f and gma-mir172d, have multiple target sites, indicating that these mirnas are functionally divergent. additionally, a single gene may be targeted by several mirnas, such as polyphenol oxidase, which is regulated by gma-mir157b and gma-mir3522b.

mature mirna quantification by northern blotting
to confirm and validate the results obtained from the solexa library, we examined the expression patterns of four known mirnas and two novel mirnas. these six mirnas  were individually selected and experimentally verified by northern blotting hybridization. the sequences of antisense rna probes are listed in additional file  <dig>  by comparing the mirna results by solexa sequencing to northern hybridization, three stress-responsive mirnas  were identified with identical expression patterns. mir166b and mir1507a were up-regulated under drought, salinity, and alkalinity conditions. mir169d was up-regulated under drought and alkalinity . while the expression patterns of mir482b and gma-m <dig> remained unchanged by the three stress conditions when tested by northern blotting. however, these were up-regulated under drought stress according to the solexa results. based on the northern blot analysis, the expression level of gma-m <dig> decreased under salinity stress, but identical patterns were observed under drought and alkalinity when compared with solexa sequencing . therefore, the expression pattern obtained by rna blot analysis may reflect the result from deep sequencing.

discussion
nowadays, characterization of the vital roles of mirnas play in plant stress responses is an active research field. although many studies have demonstrated that plant mirnas function as important regulators in development and morphogenesis processes, more reports are indicating that plant mirnas are also involved in environmental stress tolerance  <cit> .

since abiotic stress is one of the primary causes of crop losses worldwide, unraveling the complex mechanisms underlying stress resistance of plants has profound significance. recently, the newly developed sequencing technologies, such as the illumina genome analyzer , roche/ <dig> flx system, and the abi solid system, show advances over traditional methods with improved throughput and dramatically reduced cost. currently, applications of high-throughput sequencing technologies are arousing much research interest, such as identification of entire sets of mirnas, which deliver new insights into the role of mirnas in plant development, and stress related regulation. by using this method, a number of soybean mirnas have been well annotated  <cit> . differing from microarray, high throughput sequencing allows us to comprehensively survey stress related mirnas. to date, little is known about the functions of mirnas in abiotic stress responses in glycine max.

in this study, we sequenced and analyzed small rnas of the soybean under three treatments based on deep sequencing. investigation of the small rnas showed that gma-mir1507a  was represented in our sequencing libraries. one hundred and thirty three known mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas were obtained from next generation sequencing data. through expression abundance of the mirna repertoires under drought, salinity, and alkalinity stress conditions, many mirnas were found to have a wide range of expression levels between libraries. this characteristic of variability in mirna expression may be due to mirna mature processing  <cit> , and/or stress associated regulation  <cit> . we envision that these mirnas might have functional significance, suggesting they may participate in the plant stress response. highly abundant mirnas seem to exhibit similar conservation. for example, mir <dig> and mir3522b exhibit high expression levels in all four libraries and are conserved across many species. such observations support previous results that the most abundant mirnas were phylogenetically conservative  <cit> .

both mirnas and star mirnas are generated from step-loop hairpin structures. mirnas are stable and participate in translational repression or cleavage of mrna by binding or anchoring to the coding region of mrna sequences  <cit> . khvorova et al.  <cit>  inferred from the considerably low abundance of star mirnas that these strands are typically destroyed when released from pre-mirna stem. the low expression levels of star mirna sequences, such as mir156d*, mir157b*, and mir3630*, further support the mirna synthesis hypothesis. next generation sequencing is a powerful tool in the detection of mirna and star mirna . the correlation between star mirna and its flexible expression may reveal its particular regulated function. mir162* and mir482* may be involved in regulating stress. two arms of a single hairpin, giving rise to rna function isolation by different sequences, may associate with distinct biological activities. small novel mirnas annotated in our study, such as the 5' and 3' of gma- <dig> and gma <dig>  were derived from predicted hairpin structures.

plant mirnas have been reported as having a strong propensity towards regulating responses to abiotic stress, including dehydration, freezing, salinity, alkalinity, and other stresses by transcriptional factors or proteins  <cit> . expression levels of mirnas induced by environmental stressors vary. they therefore may play a key role in targeting stress-regulated genes. it has been reported that stress response mirnas were ubiquitously present in populus  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , and other plants. previous studies have reported that members of mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> were similarly regulated in stress tolerance  <cit> . in this study, members of mir1520n, mir4374b, and mir <dig> were up-regulated simultaneously under three stresses, which implies that they might target genes that function as negative regulators of stress tolerance. in addition, it was previously reported that mir <dig> was previously reported to be up-regulated in a salt induced soybean line targeting sulfurylase and asp <dig> genes under sulfate starvation conditions. therefore, we speculate that mir <dig> might be involved in non-specific salt-induced responding pathways, such as the maintenance of energy supply  <cit> . moreover, mir <dig> is responsive to dehydration stress in barley  <cit> , and it is abundant and up-regulated in soybean seedlings under dehydration conditions. mir393a, targeting f-box proteins and a basic-helix-loop-helix family protein, was up-regulated in cold, dehydration, salt, or aba stress  <cit> , and down-regulated in soybean under alkaline stress. these responsive mirnas are involved in post-transcriptional regulation during stress responsive processes.

deep sequencing of the small rna transcriptome yields an incredible amount of data, from which we can not only determine known mirnas, but also successfully explore novel mirnas with high accuracy and efficiency. first, in this study, we have identified  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas in glycine max, which illustrates the diversity of mirna expression in glycine max, revealing the presence of more mirnas than previously known. in addition, deep sequencing technologies in combination with bioinformatics analysis enabled us to profile the mirna expression patterns for further mirna functional insights, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and diverse physiological pathways. second, comparing mirna expression profiles under various induced conditions, we found significant differences in mirna regulation patterns, with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> altered expression patterns under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively. the differentially expressed mirnas obtained in this study can serve as a basis for further identification of the regulation roles of stress tolerance in glycine max.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, soybean mirnas associated with stress responses  have been identified and analyzed in combination with deep sequencing technology and in-depth bioinformatics analysis. one hundred and thirty three conserved mirnas representing  <dig> mirna families were expressed in soybeans under three treatments. in addition,  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> mirnas are either uniquely or differently expressed under drought, salinity, and alkalinity, respectively, suggesting that many mirnas are inducible and are differentially expressed in response to certain stress. this study has important implications for further identification of gene regulation under abiotic stresses and significantly contributes a complete profile of mirnas in glycine max.

materials and methods
sample collection and treatment
an inbred line of 'hj-1', one of the abiotic stress sensitive soybeans, was used in our study. for each inbred line, the uniform seeds were treated with ethanol for  <dig> minutes and then rinsed several times with sterile distilled water. these seeds were cultured in  <dig> × hoagland's nutrient solution . when the four leaf stage was reached, we began to put them under different stress treatments salt , alkalinity  and drought  stress) for  <dig> hours, with the unstressed plants as a mock. then roots of  <dig> seedlings were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later use.

small rna sequencing library construction
the isolated rna samples were purified on 15% page gel for size selection. small rnas, <  <dig> bases, were ligated with a pair of solexa sequencing adaptor primers  using t <dig> rna ligase. ligated rna was size-fractionated on a 10% agarose gel and the 70- <dig> nt fractions were amplified for  <dig> cycles to transform rna to cdna to produce sequencing libraries. the purified libraries with approximately  <dig> mg of small rna were used for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the solexa sequencer  according to the manufacturer's instructions. all the short reads were deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  and can be accessed in the short read archive  under the accession number sra <dig> .

bioinformatics analysis
after solexa sequencing, high-quality small rna reads were extracted from raw reads through filtering out the low quality tags and eliminating contamination of adaptor sequences. the resulted set of unique sequences with related read counts were deemed as clean sequence tags. matched sequences were then queried against non-coding rnas  from rfam database using soap  <dig>  program http://soap.genomics.org.cn/. any small rna read matches to these sequences were excluded from further analysis. next, we aligned all sequences against the mirbase <dig>  again http://mirbase.org/ using soap  <dig>  to search for known mirnas with allowed mismatches . to compare mirna expression data under the four diverse treatments, initially, each identified mirna read count was normalized to the total number of reads in each given sample. then, bayesian method was applied to evaluate the statistical significance . after the bayesian test, if the p value ≤  <dig>  and the normalized sequence counts changed more than two folds, the specific mirna was considered to be differently expressed.

reads that did not match any databases above were marked as unannotated. to identify novel mirna prediction, small rna tags that matched mirbase and rfam were filtered and the remaining tags were aligned with the glycine max genome. to analyze whether the matched sequence could form a suitable hairpin , sequences surrounding the matched sequence were extracted. the second structure was predicted by rnafold http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/rnafold.cgi. thereafter, novel mirnas were identified using the mireap program developed by the bgi  and mirtools  <cit> . the mirna candidate targets were predicted using psrnatarget http://bioinfo <dig> noble.org/psrnatarget/. the cog  terms of target genes were annotated by comparing with cogs from ncbi http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cog.

mirna quantification by real-time pcr
total rna  was used for synthetizing reverse transcripts with one step primescript® mirna cdna synthesis kit  in  <dig> μl reaction mixture. the reaction was performed at 37°c for  <dig> min, 85°c for  <dig> seconds following the manufacturer's instruction. rt-pcr was performed with sybr® premix ex taq ii™ . primers designed in additional file  <dig> were used to amplify specific mirna. soybean 5s rrna was used as the endogenous control. uni-mir qpcr primer was added as the common reverse primer. the qrt-pcr reactions were carried out in a final volume of  <dig> μl containing  <dig>  μl sybr® premix ex taq™,  <dig> μl forward and reverse primers, and  <dig> μl template. to estimate the relative abundance of mirnas in stress induced samples, the ct value was directly compared and transformed into a fold-change difference. these reactions were performed using the abi <dig> .

mirna verification by northern blot
for mirnas quantification, northern blot hybridization was conducted using the high sensitive mirna northern blot assay kit .  <dig> μg total rna of each sample was electrophoresed on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to membrane . antisense rna biotin labeled in the 5' end  was used for hybridization probes. the cyber green® ii-stained  rrna bands in the polyacrylamide gel are shown as a loading control.
