BACKGROUND
recently, boddicker et al.  <cit>  identified a major qtl on sus scrofa chromosome  <dig>  at 139136697– <dig> that accounts for  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the genetic variance for host response of young pigs to experimental prrs virus infection, as measured by serum viremia from  <dig> to 21 days post infection  and weight gain to  <dig> dpi. in addition, a snp  was identified that appeared to be in complete ld with the qtl. biological candidate genes in the region that have been previously studied include members of the guanylate binding protein  family  <cit> . the five members of the gbp family that are located in the qtl region all represent potential candidate genes for the qtl effect. the gbp proteins work together in an interferon -inducible complex to mediate a proinflammatory immune response to stimuli such as the gram-negative bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide   <cit> . the gbps can stimulate caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis, a specific form of apoptosis triggered by pathological stimuli such as contact with microbes, toxins or viruses  <cit> . both gbp <dig> and gbp <dig> have been associated with the ability to control pathogen replication  <cit>  but gbp <dig> is not assigned to the ssc <dig> qtl region. the gbp <dig> protein has previously been shown to play a role in immune response through mediation of inflammasome assembly  <cit> . thus, the ssc <dig> qtl region includes several very good biological candidate genes, but because of high ld in the region, further fine mapping of the qtl is problematic.

the gbp <dig> protein is an important mediator of inflammatory immune response in mammals. loss of gbp <dig> function in a knockout mouse model results in impaired host defense and inflammatory response because gbp <dig> facilitates nucleotide binding and oligomerization, leucine-rich repeat protein  <dig>  mediated inflammasome assembly  <cit> . specifically, nlrp <dig> interacts with tetrameric gbp <dig> to promote inflammasome assembly with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain protein   <cit> . the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of gbp <dig> are required for tetramerization, and loss of tetrameric gbp <dig> abolished nlrp <dig> inflammasome mediated asc assembly  <cit> . mice lacking functional gbp <dig> had significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment in response to peritonitis. further, these knockout mice also had increased bacterial burdens, severely reduced cd11b + cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and noticable weight loss in response to l. monocytogenes infection  <cit> . in addition, one study indicated that gbp <dig> expression was upregulated in response to epstein-barr viral infection  <cit> . however, the role and connection between gbp <dig> and viral immune response has not been characterized.

the objective of this study was to use functional genomics methods to identify the gene and mutation responsible for the observed qtl on ssc <dig> for host response to prrs virus infection. we present evidence for a putative causal mutation based on differential expression, allele specific expression and differential splicing data that created an illegitimate splice site in gbp <dig>  furthermore, we show that the mutation is in 100 % linkage disequilibrium  with the previously reported ssc <dig> qtl in an independent population.

RESULTS
de novo transcript assembly to improve gene expression quantification in the ssc <dig> region
several genomic assembly issues were identified in the ssc <dig> qtl region that made accurate quantification of gene expression problematic. for example, the gbp <dig> transcript in the sus scrofa  <dig>  genome assembly  was missing the c-terminal end of gbp <dig> that contains a conserved caax box domain required for cellular localization. using translated blast to compare rna-seq reads to the human protein, exon  <dig> of gbp <dig> was identified approximately 200 kb 5′ of the start site of gbp <dig> in sscrofa build  <dig> . in addition, the predicted ensembl gene enssscg <dig> was noted to have nearly equal identity to fragments of gbp <dig> and gbp <dig>  we also identified several gaps in the reference sequence within the qtl region in sscrofa build <dig>  that were indicative of assembly problems. a transcript reassembly was conducted, after which all transcripts were compared to the pig and human genomes to ensure the presence of the entire protein coding sequence. for reference, the original order of the genes from the sscrofa build  <dig>  is provided in additional file  <dig>  full-length transcripts were identified for gbp <dig>  gbp <dig>  gbp <dig>  gtf2b, ccbl <dig>  and pkn <dig>  the gbp <dig> and gbp <dig> transcripts were assembled utilizing the existing transcript information and the human transcripts for these genes. the fasta formatted sequence of all cdnas corresponding to the eight genes assembled is provided in additional file  <dig>  we were unable to identify fragments of the enssscg <dig> transcript from sscrofa build  <dig>  in our de -novo assembly. thus, this gene may be the product of a genome misassembly, may not be expressed in whole blood, or may be a non-functional gene duplication. the syntenic human chromosomal block to the qtl region includes the gbp <dig> gene but this gene was not found in the de novo transcriptome assembly or by blast search of the human gbp <dig> protein against either the rna-seq reads or our de novo transcript assembly of this region. this gene is also missing from sscrofa build  <dig> .

read mapping statistics
seventy sample sequences from  <dig> pigs and  <dig> time points following experimental infection were retained after quality control for identification of differentially expressed  genes . the average percentage of reads that uniquely mapped to the sscrofa build <dig>  reference genome for these  <dig> samples was  <dig>  %. mapping percentages for individual samples are provided in additional file  <dig> 

identification of differentially expressed genes due to qtl genotype
all eight gene transcripts from the ssc <dig> qtl region were analyzed for differential expression, with a primary focus on the effects of qtl genotype and genotype by dpi. a total of three transcripts were de due to genotype across dpi, and  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> transcripts were de due to genotype by day effects on  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi, respectively . no transcripts were de at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. significant transcript log <dig> fold changes are provided in fig. 1a. genes that were de due to genotype included gbp <dig>  gbp <dig>  and gbp6; however, only gbp <dig> was de across multiple time points  . the log <dig> fold changes, p-values and false discovery rates  for all genes in the ssc <dig> qtl region are presented in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> gbp <dig> is differentially expressed as a function of the prrs host response qtl across timepoints. guanylate binding protein  <dig>  is differentially expressed and exhibits allele specific expression  as a function of rs <dig> genotype at  <dig> , <dig>  and 14 days post infection  with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  in phgc trial  <dig> rna-seq data. a differences in the mean, model normalized gene expression value and log <dig> fold change values for expression of gbp <dig> between the ab  and aa  genotypes at the ssc <dig> qtl. *indicates false discovery rate <  <dig> . b schematic of the gbp <dig> transcript coding dna sequence. variants tested for ase are shown in black text. the putative causal mutation is shown in red text. the three protein domains shown were identified from the human gbp <dig> protein as annotated at ensembl in release  <dig>  the box shown in orange corresponds to the p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase domain ). the box shown in green corresponds to the gbp n and c terminal domains . the box shown in red corresponds to the caax box localization signal required for proper cellular localization of the gbp <dig> protein. ^the rs <dig> variant is not included in the transcript and is shown here only to provide context since it is predicted to cause a shift in the transcript reading frame and an early stop codon that truncates the  <dig> c-terminal aa of the protein. c identification of ase at  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> dpi for gbp <dig> for snps in phase with the b rs <dig> allele. the 95 % confidence intervals for estimates of allele proportions are provided



allele specific expression  analysis identified higher expression of gbp <dig> alleles in ld with the favorable qtl allele
a total of  <dig> snps in the eight genes in the ssc <dig> qtl region were in complete ld with the ssc <dig> qtl based on concordance with rs <dig> genotype. these  <dig> snps were analyzed for ase in animals that were heterozygous for rs <dig>  all snps were filtered by minimum read depth to avoid the analysis of false snps due to sequencing errors. of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> snps exhibited ase when averaged across dpi while fdr was controlled at 5 %. the greatest number of snps identified that exhibited ase per gene were in gbp <dig> , gbp <dig> , gbp <dig> , and gbp <dig> . the estimated probability of expression of the alternate allele  averaged across all dpi time points for these snps in ld with the qtl are presented in additional file  <dig>  however, gbp <dig> was the only gene with all snps in ld that showed consistent main effects for ase across all snps tested, as presented in fig. 1b and c. estimates of allelic proportions and p-values for these ase snps are presented for each dpi in additional file  <dig>  a list of ase results for additional snps that were not in complete ld with rs <dig> is provided in additional file  <dig> 

identification of a putative causal mutation in gbp <dig> that introduces an illegitimate splice acceptor site
since gbp <dig> was de between qtl genotypes at several dpi, exhibited ase, and was a strong biological candidate gene, we carefully examined the rna sequence data of this gene for variants. interestingly, a t > g snp  was identified in intron  <dig> of gbp <dig> that appeared to introduce an additional splice acceptor site five base pairs 5′ to the start of exon  <dig> in animals that possessed the unfavorable a qtl allele. this splice acceptor snp was previously assigned the ncbi dbsnp id rs <dig>  the position of rs <dig> relative to snps exhibiting ase and the gene structure of gbp <dig> is presented in fig. 2a. the context of rs <dig> within the gbp <dig> transcript is presented in additional file  <dig>  reads that mapped to gbp <dig> exon  <dig>  intron  <dig> and exon  <dig> were evaluated for splicing consistent with multiple alternatively spliced transcripts . three alternate transcripts were identified, including the wild-type transcript, a transcript with a five nucleotide insertion 5′ to exon  <dig> , and a transcript that retained intron  <dig> . the rs <dig> g allele introduces a new splice acceptor site, which causes five nucleotides to be inserted into the gbp <dig> transcript. this five nucleotide insertion is expected to shift the reading frame of gbp <dig>  altering the first  <dig> amino acids encoded by exon  <dig> and introduces an early stop codon that truncates the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of the protein, including the caax box. transcripts that contained the five-nucleotide insertion were identified consistently in individuals with the aa qtl genotype, but had a much lower frequency in individuals with the ab qtl genotype. the transcript assembly confirmed the presence of three gbp <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts . the sequence of the wild-type transcript is provided in additional file  <dig>  additional file  <dig> shows the predicted frameshift due to the rs <dig> g allele at the protein level in aa and ab qtl genotype individuals in comparison to the amino acid sequence of gbp <dig> in human, cattle and mouse using clustalw  <cit> . the predicted effects of all other variants detected in linkage disequilibrium or equilibrium with rs <dig> are listed in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.fig.  <dig> association and validation of guanylate binding protein  <dig>  differential splicing with rs <dig> genotype. a schematic of the sequence level differences between the three alternate transcripts of gbp <dig>  including the position of the putative causal variant . the schematic displays how the rs <dig> g allele creates a new splice acceptor site in intron  <dig>  while the t allele destroys the splice site. the wild-type splicing transcript includes only the sequence in black, while the +5bp insert transcript includes the extra five nucleotides shown in blue. the retained intron transcript includes the entire  <dig> nucleotide intron. the rs <dig> g allele is in perfect linkage disequilibrium  with the unfavorable rs <dig> “a” allele while the rs <dig> t allele is in perfect ld with the favorable rs <dig> “b” allele. b differential splicing of gbp <dig> by rs <dig> genotype across all days post infection  time points. splicing was measured as the percentage of read counts from each alternate transcript standardized for all read counts from the phgc trial  <dig> rna-seq data. this figure demonstrates that very little wild-type splicing transcript is produced by the aa  genotype compared to the ab  rs <dig> genotype . in contrast, considerably more of the alternate transcript  is produced in the aa compared to the ab rs <dig> genotyped individuals. c confirmation of gbp <dig> differential splicing due to rs <dig> genotype across all dpi following infection using quantitative capillary electrophoresis. this analysis validates that very little or no wild-type splicing transcript is produced by aa  vs. ab  ssc <dig> rs <dig> genotyped individuals . consistent with the rna-seq results, more of the alternate transcript with five extra nucleotides is quantified in blood rna from aa vs. ab rs <dig> genotyped individuals. expression values are presented as transcript molarity



gbp <dig> exhibited differential splicing
to evaluate the relationship of altered gbp <dig> splicing with the ssc <dig> qtl genotype, all rna-seq reads that discriminate the three alternatively spliced transcripts were counted. altered splicing was observed to segregate consistently with the aa and ab rs <dig> genotypes. a significantly lower number of wild-type splicing read counts was present in aa compared to ab individuals, after standardization of each alternate transcript as the proportion of total reads produced per sample across all three transcripts .

independent validation of gbp <dig> differential splicing
the correspondence of differential splicing to the prrs qtl genotype was further validated in an analysis across five dpi using aati capillary electrophoresis technology . the wild-type splicing transcript was identified as over-expressed in rna from whole blood of ab vs. aa genotype animals . in contrast, the +5 bp insertion allele was identified as over-expressed in the aa vs. ab genotype animals . abundance of the retained intron appeared to be similar between genotypes. removal or inclusion of the retained intron in the statistical analysis did not change the observed results.

rna-seq validation using an independent population
gene expression data from animals of a different genetic background used in an independent validation study were used to determine if gbp <dig> was de between the prrs qtl genotypes. in the validation population ), gbp <dig> expression was measured by rna-seq and analyzed in aa and ab rs <dig> genotyped pigs at the same five time points  following experimental prrs infection as in the present study. gbp <dig> was de for the main effect of genotype and at four of the five dpi time points . consistent with the first study, gbp <dig> differential splicing was associated with the rs <dig> snp genotype in the validation population . three snps within the gbp <dig> transcript were identified to exhibit ase . however, three snps  did not exhibit ase. at least  <dig> of the  <dig> ab individuals with rna-seq data appear to be homozygous, and likely uninformative. these results validate that gbp <dig> rna levels, splicing and ase after prrsv infection are different between prrs ssc <dig> qtl genotypes and that the rs <dig> snp is the putative causative mutation through alternative splicing.fig.  <dig> validation of differential expression, splicing and allele specific expression of guanylate binding protein  <dig> . gbp <dig> transcript levels and allelic abundances were analyzed at  <dig> , <dig>  and 14 days post infection  with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  virus in phgc trial  <dig> rna-seq data. a validation of differential expression of gbp <dig> between the ab  and aa  rs <dig> genotypes. *indicates false discovery rate <  <dig> . b validation of allele specific expression of gbp <dig> snps in phase with the b rs <dig> allele. c validation of gbp <dig> differential splicing due to rs <dig> genotype across dpi. spliced reads uniquely mapping to the three alternate transcripts were analyzed as the percentage of total reads from the rna-seq data. both the wild-type and five nucleotide insertion  alleles were differentially spliced between the aa  and ab  rs <dig> genotypes . there was a trend towards a small difference in the quantity of the retained intron due to rs <dig> genotype . alternate gbp <dig> transcripts are labeled on the x-axis



concordance of the gbp <dig> variant rs <dig> with rs <dig> in an independent population
an allele specific snp assay was developed to genotype both the gbp <dig> rs <dig> and rs <dig> variants. a total of  <dig> boars from an independent commercial yorkshire breeding population were genotyped to determine the correspondence of the putative causal variant in gbp <dig> with the rs <dig> snp that tracks the prrs qtl. importantly, despite the presence of two different b rs <dig> qtl haplotypes  <cit> , one in phgc <dig> and a second in the phgc <dig> population, the rs <dig> snp is 100 % concordant .

discussion
the goal of this study was to identify the gene and causal variant responsible for the ssc <dig> qtl for prrs resistance. a secondary goal was to identify potential molecular mechanisms for the qtl. the results of the rna-seq study provide multiple lines of evidence that the rs <dig> splice acceptor mutation in gbp <dig> is a strong candidate causal mutation for this qtl.

porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome  is the most costly infectious disease in the global pig industry  <cit>  with an annual cost of $ <dig> million to the us industry alone  <cit> . prrs is caused by infection with an enveloped positive stranded rna virus  <cit> . clinical signs of prrs include late-term reproductive failure in sows and respiratory illness in growing pigs . prrs virus is also a cofactor in other disease syndromes, such as porcine respiratory disease complex  and porcine circovirus-associated disease   <cit> . vaccination for protection against prrsv infection has generally been unsuccessful, primarily due to the high degree of antigenic and genetic drift in viral structural and non-structural proteins and the capacity of the virus to subvert early innate immune responses  <cit> . genetics of the host has been well documented as another factor associated with susceptibility and response of the pig to prrs . the impact of prrs on swine health, well-being and severity of additional pathogen infections when combined with prrs underscores the importance of host genetics and major gene variation in porcine immune response.

three genes were de between the aa  and ab  prrs host response qtl genotypes . however, only gbp <dig> was identified as de across multiple time points post infection  and across all time points . this result was validated in an independent rna-seq experiment from a different pig population obtained through the prrs host genetics consortium . since this second study was not designed specifically to identify differences in gene expression due to the ssc <dig> qtl genotype, but also focused on the effects of different host response phenotypes, this result provides strong evidence that gbp <dig> is de due to qtl genotype. this result indicates that differential expression of gbp <dig> is related to or mediates the qtl effect on prrs host response.

to provide additional evidence for differences in expression, an ase analysis of all snps in complete ld with the prrs host response qtl was conducted to determine if evidence of allelic imbalance exists in correspondence with the qtl genotype. gbp <dig> was the only gene where all snps in ld with qtl exhibited ase. this result was validated in the independent phgc <dig> rna-seq data set for three of the six snps. the three snps that were not ase appeared to be uninformative based on the lack of expression of an alternate allele in half of the ab animals in the phgc <dig> dataset, which is supported by the multiple b qtl haplotypes identified in this population  <cit> . there are many potential reasons for statistical evidence of ase, including differences in regulatory factor binding, imprinting, dna methylation, rna splicing, rna stability, rna editing, and mirna mediated silencing. since all snps in gbp <dig> exhibited ase, we hypothesized that ase in gbp <dig> may occur due to differences in rna stability or splicing.

evidence from rna-seq data and de novo assembly indicated that gbp <dig> exhibited alternative splicing. concurrently, we identified the rs <dig> snp in gbp <dig>  for which the allele that was in perfect ld with the unfavorable a allele at the ssc <dig> qtl inserted five nucleotides into the gbp <dig> transcript upstream of exon  <dig>  this insertion is expected to result in an early stop codon and thus a non-functional gbp <dig> protein. since this snp was predicted to change the splicing of gbp <dig>  we used rna-seq reads spanning the specific splice junctions to quantify the three alternatively spliced gbp <dig> transcripts across all time points. the wild-type splicing transcript was expressed more in individuals with the ab qtl genotype , while the five nucleotide insertion transcript was more highly expressed in aa individuals . no difference in expression was observed for the retained intron transcript between genotypes. splicing consistent with these results was observed in a second population . we validated the differential splicing results using quantitative capillary electrophoresis . interestingly, we could not detect the wild-type splicing transcript in aa individuals using this method. these results indicate that individuals with the aa qtl genotype produce almost no wild-type gbp <dig> transcript and an excess of the transcript that is expected to produce a non-functional protein. thus, we predict that individuals with the aa qtl genotype produce very little functional gbp <dig> protein. none of the other  <dig> snps in ld identified in the qtl region . the facts that ab qtl genotyped individuals produce significantly more wild-type splicing transcript than aa individuals, and that aa individuals produce almost no wild-type splicing gbp <dig>  while producing large amounts of a non-functional transcript, are consistent with the observed dominance of the b qtl allele  <cit> . it is unclear whether the differential expression of gbp <dig> completely depends on differential splicing, since the rs <dig> snp is in perfect ld with the prrs host response qtl. thus, it is difficult to determine whether the genotype-specific differences in gbp <dig> expression are directly related to changes in splicing or caused by other mechanisms involved in transcript stability such as nonsense mediated decay.

to further validate the degree of concordance of the rs <dig> snp with the ssc <dig> prrs host response qtl, this snp was genotyped along with the rs <dig> snp in an independent set of pigs from a different phgc trial that showed the same effect of the ssc <dig> region on host response to prrs. despite the presence of a different b qtl haplotype, the rs <dig> snp was 100 % concordant with the rs <dig> snp in  <dig> commercial yorkshire boars. since these boars represent a different genetic background from the ones used in this study, this further supports that rs <dig> is the causal mutation for the ssc <dig> prrs host response qtl.

the gbp proteins are excellent candidates to play important roles in host response to bacterial and viral infections. recent studies of the gbp <dig> knockout mouse indicate that gbp <dig> functions in host defense, inflammasome assembly, and inflammatory response  <cit> . gbp <dig> serves as an important adaptor and mediator protein in nlrp <dig> inflammasome activation. furthermore, deletion of the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids of gbp <dig> abolished the nlrp <dig> mediated inflammasome assembly and downstream immune response. protein modeling was used to confirm that the structure of the c-terminus of gbp <dig> appears to be conserved across the human, mouse and pig  <cit>  . the splice mutation described in this study results in severely reduced expression of wild-type gbp <dig> and a frameshift that leads to an early stop codon and truncation of the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids. these results indicate that pigs with the aa qtl genotype likely have very little to no gbp <dig> mediated nlrp <dig> inflammasome response to infection. relatively little is known about the role of gbp <dig> in human or animal immune responses to viruses. one study indicates that gbp <dig> expression is upregulated during epstien-barr viral infection  <cit> ; however, the role of gbp <dig> in viral immune response is unknown. the implication that gbp <dig> plays a role in host genetic response to prrs may indicate additional biological roles for gbp <dig> in host suppression of viral replication. therefore, this study may direct new avenues of research into the role of gbp <dig> in viral immune response and in identification of novel therapeutic targets.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we present multiple lines of evidence that the introduction of a new splice acceptor site in gbp <dig> at the rs <dig> snp is a putative causal mutation for the ssc <dig> host prrs response qtl. first, rna-seq analyses in two independent populations confirm that gbp <dig> was de as a function of ssc <dig> qtl genotype. second, all gbp <dig> snps in perfect ld with the ssc <dig> qtl exhibited ase, with a shift towards higher expression of alleles that were in phase with the favorable b qtl allele. third, differential splicing of gbp <dig> was associated with specific ssc <dig> qtl genotypes. fourth, the rs <dig> snp was validated to be in perfect ld with the ssc <dig> qtl in an independent genetic background. fifth, the rs <dig> snp introduced five nucleotides into exon  <dig> of the gbp <dig> transcript, which is predicted to shift the reading frame and result in an early stop codon that truncates the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids. finally, almost no wild-type gbp <dig> transcript was produced in individuals with the aa qtl genotype. since gbp <dig> is known to play a role in host immune response and inflammation based on studies in the knockout mouse, it is a strong candidate gene for the ssc <dig> prrs host response qtl. for these reasons, we believe that the rs <dig> gbp <dig> snp is the causal mutation for this economically important qtl.
