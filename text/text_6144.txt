BACKGROUND
a condition's gene signature is defined as the group of genes in a given cell type whose combined expression pattern is uniquely characteristic of that condition  <cit> . the use of gene signatures can potentially be of considerable value in the field of clinical diagnosis. however, gene signatures defined by different investigators using different methods can be quite various even when applied on the same disease and the same endpoint. therefore, it brings noise to the microarray-based clinical applications. for example, in the second phase of the microarray quality control  project  <cit> , a total of  <dig>  <dig> gene signatures were defined by over  <dig> data analysis teams  for  <dig> endpoints. interestingly, the genes identified in each gene signature were different for each endpoint, with some of the signatures failing to share any gene in common. however, despite the variability of these gene signatures, they still have relatively good predictable power. then an important question is raised that why so many gene signatures can be selected for the same disease with similar predictive performance. whether there is any signature that contains the smallest number of genes and has good performance at the same time?

previous studies have shown that the correct selection of subsets of genes from microarray data is key for the accurate classification of disease phenotypes  <cit> , as this procedure not only removes features that do not provide significant incremental information, but also enables more rapid and efficient analysis  <cit> . to this end, a number of studies have been proposed  <cit> . one of them is the so-called minimum redundancy-maximum relevance . this method employs features that are maximally dissimilar to each other in terms of euclidean distances or pair-wise correlations  <cit> . based on mrmr method, incremental feature selection  has been employed to determine how many features in the list mrmr generated should be selected  <cit> . an alternative strategy, called joint core genes, makes use of two independent lung cancer microarray datasets  <cit>  to increase robustness of prediction. sparse linear programming   <cit>  represents a third approach which has been applied to a large microarray dataset derived analyzing from liver gene expression of compound-treated rats. in this third approach, a necessary gene set  is constructed through a stripping procedure, after which no valid signature can be derived from its complement   <cit> . support vector machine methods based on recursive feature elimination  refine the optimum feature set by using svm-train to compute the ranking criteria, which eliminate the feature with smallest ranking criterion  <cit> . like svmrfe, recursive feature addition  employs supervised learning, and combines it with statistical similarity measures  <cit> . however, these methods refine the subsets by only considering each single feature. furthermore, none of them have confirmed the fundamental association between the genes identified in each gene signature and the phenotype of the disease, which is considered to be important in clinical applications.

maqc-ii is a collaborative research project that includes individuals from multiple data analysis teams  to generate gene expression signatures for three clinical datasets and three toxicogenomics datasets  <cit> , and offers a valuable chance for studying the relationship between gene signatures and their genes. each dat has the freedom to choose their own method for signature development, which has lead to many different signatures with similar predictive power for the same endpoint. the diversity of the gene signatures being largely attributed to the different modeling processes  <cit>  that has been applied to the data. consequently, these maqc-ii gene expression signatures offer a unique opportunity to develop novel meta-analysis strategies that yield a minimum set of features with maximum predictive power.

in this study we have sought to develop effective meta-analysis strategies to transform the maqc-ii signatures into a robust and reliable set of biomarker for clinical applications.

the analyses workflow is outlined in figure  <dig>  specifically, we first conducted signature similarity analyses at probe level, which can select probes that are consistently considered by multiple signatures, results in a subset of features  that were further analyzed using a method designated minimize feature's size . mfs is an iterative backward stepwise elimination method with the purpose of minimizing the gene set  and thus generating a signature of smaller size and improving predictive power based on the resultant feature set. on the other hand, analyses at gene level and gene ontology  level were proposed to confirm biological significance.

the analyses are focused on two endpoints of the maqc-ii breast cancer datasets, i.e., pathologic complete response  and estrogen receptor status . the datasets contain a training dataset and a validation dataset  <cit> . the minimized signatures were built on the training dataset and be validated on the validation dataset. correspondingly, the swap models are signatures built on validation dataset and be validated on the training dataset. it is worthwhile to mention that the training and validation datasets are profiled separately in different timeframes, thus providing a real-world clinical application scenario.

RESULTS
similarity analyses at probe level
thirty-two gene signatures for endpoint d and  <dig> for endpoint e were used for the similarity analyses. overlap matrices at probe level for each of two signatures were constructed . for endpoint d,  <dig> probes appeared at least twice among a total set of  <dig>  <dig> , whereas for endpoint e,  <dig> probes appeared among  <dig>  <dig>  . the gene esr <dig> or estrogen receptor  <dig>  appears  <dig> and  <dig> times in endpoints d and e, respectively, ranking top  <dig> in both groups . however, the comparison among all the involved models for each endpoint revealed that not all dats chose the most differentially expressed probes, indicating that the selection criteria were not consistent . further analyses about probesets for both endpoints are available in additional file  <dig> 

this table shows prime analyses at levels of probes and genes for normal models and swap models. total refers to the total number of irredundant probes and genes, with means and variances of models for each endpoint be listed in mean . rate refers to the proportion of overlaps in unique sets of probes and genes. the numbers of overlaps between unique sets of probes and genes of both endpoints are calculated, which are displaced in endpoint overlap. note that two probes for niehs_br_e_ <dig> were removed as they do not appear in the affymetrix u133a platform. we compared lists of probes for each group of data to get overlaps at probe level. if two probes overlapped at probe level, they must also overlap at gene level; if two probes are not same but they share the same gene, they can also overlapped at gene level. this table suggested that the overlap rates of endpoint e are always greater than those of endpoint d. for normal models, the number of features for both endpoints have no significant difference  and there is either no significant difference for that of swap models . furthermore, overlap rates at gene level are greater than those at probe level, suggested that the number of non-identical probes which share the same genes is large.

model development based on the optimal set of features and the validation
the minimized signatures were built by mfs based on the result of similarity analysis at probe level. the parameters and performances of our new models, br_d_model and br_e_model, are listed in table  <dig>  for each endpoint, matthew's correlation coefficient  of internal validation was improved using the mfs method, and values of validation dataset also performed well. the intervals of external validation values for all input classifiers were   for endpoints d and   for endpoint e, respectively; the maximum value in both endpoints was slightly smaller than those of br_d_model  and br_e_model . further external validations on endpoint e with ev <dig> dataset  <cit>  and ev <dig> dataset  <cit>  also verified our model . swap predictions  were also carried out between validation dataset and training dataset based on swap models submitted by dats. however, the results of two new models from swap validations  were not as good as the independent validations of the best model .

acc is short for accuracy, sen for sensitivity, spe for specificity and stddev for standard deviation. the cv rows refer to internal validation and the val rows refer to validation of the training dataset against the validation dataset. we balanced the training dataset for swap_br_d_model, as the p/n ratio is too small , as mcc is very sensitive and its value might change a lot even for a small predictive error in p/n ratio  unbalanced datasets. features of br_d_model and br_e_model are available at additional file  <dig> 

to systematically evaluate the performances of these original models and swap models, heatmaps for these signatures on training dataset and validation dataset were created . furthermore, a three-dimensional graph was plotted, based on values of their mcc, val_mcc  and std_dev . a model that is located at upper left corner in this graph tends to have better mmc and val_mcc with small standard deviation, and better performance. our models for two endpoints are located at upper left corner and on the top of all other models displayed in the graphs  .

biological significance among signatures
to identify the biological significance among signatures, we first performed the similarity analyses at gene level and go level. the number of genes shared by different signatures for each endpoint was quite large, and a gene can be selected more than once by a signature since multiple probes on the microarray can map to a single gene. for endpoints d and e,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total genes appeared in common, among which ca <dig>  related probes appeared  <dig> and  <dig> times, respectively . then we carried out go enrichment analysis using the gominer algorithm  <cit> , and go terms were sorted according to the number of genes associated within the 5th level . the enrichment results of biological process for both endpoints are regulation of cellular metabolic process, and those of cellular component for both are intracellular part. the results of molecular function are sequence specific dna binding and actin binding for endpoints d and e, respectively.

genes marked '+' indicates experimental support for a role in breast cancer in support. unless otherwise stated, descriptions were collected from entrez gene  <cit> . numbers in the overlap reflect number of gene overlap, for the top  <dig> ranked genes of two endpoints. values for position reflect these genes' rank in the descending sorted list of fold-change values, signs of which represent gene positions in the two ends of the list. almost all top  <dig> genes for each endpoint rank in the top  <dig> up-regulated or down-regulated genes. furthermore, among the genes common to these two endpoints, the change in expression level was not always correlated. in other words, genes up-regulated in endpoint d could be down-regulated in endpoint e.

to further validate the biological significance, we analyzed the similarity between two endpoints at probe and gene levels. it was found that  <dig> % of probes  were common to both endpoints;  <dig> % of probes  were unique for endpoint d, while  <dig> %  were unique for endpoint e. comparisons at the gene level gave similar results. about 31% of genes  were common to both groups, while  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of genes were unique to endpoints d and e, respectively. interestingly, these two endpoints for breast cancer share a large number of overlapping probes and genes.

noticeably, the observation that the two endpoints for the same disease share a lot of genes raised the possibility that the gene signatures for both endpoints could be interchangeable. we tested this hypothesis by cross-prediction with two minimized signatures, i.e. signatures for endpoint d were used for prediction tasks of endpoint e and vice versa. interestingly, subsequent analysis results confirmed our hypothesis, although these two endpoints represent two different aspects of breast cancer. with the model br_d_model to predict the endpoint e, we obtained a mcc of  <dig>  for internal validation, and  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for validation datasets, ev <dig> dataset and ev <dig> dataset, respectively. with br_e_model to endpoint d, the internal validation result is  <dig> , and validation result for validation dataset is  <dig> . moreover, clinical data show that associations between these two endpoints were significant  <cit> , and this association was confirmed by kendall's rank correlation test  with maqc-ii breast cancer datasets.

furthermore, protein-protein interaction  topology property changed marginally between probes of the minimized signatures and their input, which is also a support to biological significance. all-pairs shortest path matrices  <cit>  were constructed for each pair of probes in the minimized gene signatures based on a unique ppi network data archived at unihi for affymetrix probes  <cit> . that is, from the node of the first probe in a pair, we searched for the second one in the network using the breadth first search  algorithm  <cit> . for each pair within the matrix, three outcomes were potential:  one or both of them are not in the network,  there is no link between the pairs, and  the pair is linked. we defined the average length of the matrix as the mean of all linked pairs, and k-th level neighbor as the pair of probes whose distance between them is k. it suggested that the number of third and fourth level neighbors, and pairs that are not connected decreased sharply. however, that the average lengths of shortest path matrices changed marginally, and that all  <dig> levels  remain between probes of the minimized signatures and their input, suggesting that the topological properties of the ppi subsets consist of stable features, which are not changed by mfs .

discussion
gene signatures of large and small size could perform equally well in clinical applications. for example, the niehs and sai predictors for the breast cancer endpoint e  have close predictive powers , but completely different feature sizes. the above suggests that it is probable to minimize the size of gene signatures while maintaining their predictive power. this notion is also supported by previous study that small gene signatures can perform well in discriminative analyses  <cit> .

biological importance can be inferred through simple similarity analyses of gene signatures for each studied endpoint on the overlapping genes. interestingly, a number of predictive gene markers were experimentally confirmed to be related to breast cancer . these observations are consistent with all other predictable endpoints of the maqc-ii project. for example, ca <dig>  a highly correlated gene with estrogen receptor α , is robustly regulated by estrogen via erα in breast cancer cells, and this regulation involves a distal estrogen-responsive enhancer region  <cit> . esr <dig> encodes an estrogen receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor composed of several domains important for hormone binding, dna binding, and activation of transcription  <cit> . besides, high levels of mapt  mrna expression in er-positive breast cancer indicate an endocrine-sensitive, but chemotherapy-resistant disease. in contrast, low tau expression levels are associated with a subset of er-positive cancers that have poor prognosis with tamoxifen alone and may benefit from taxane-containing chemotherapy  <cit> . moreover, gata <dig>  is reported as a breast cancer marker and is expressed almost among all er-positive tumors  <cit> . low levels of gata <dig> are associated with invasive breast carcinomas  <cit> . numerous studies, notably based on microarray data, have shown that expression of gata <dig> is strongly and positively correlated with that of esr <dig>  the strong correlation between esr <dig> and gata <dig> expression in breast cancer tissues implies that gata <dig> might cooperate with this steroid receptor to regulate breast tissue-specific hormone-responsive genes  <cit> .

since the minimization process can remove probes regardless of their ranking, some top-ranked probes are removed without affecting the predictive power of the model. to find out the reasons, we re-mapped the probes for two minimized signatures to corresponding genes, and no overlapping gene was found in the re-mapped list for br_d_model and only  <dig> genes overlapped in br_e_model. that is, probes with more than one corresponding genes were rarely observed after the minimized process. to further inquire this phenomenon, we also examined the distribution of these genes based on the pathways archived at msigdb  <cit> . although the number of genes in the signatures was small, a large number of pathways were found to be represented, and most of these pathways included only one or two genes in each pathway. among the genes involved in multiple pathways, ccnd <dig>  il <dig>  igf1r, and myb participate in more than  <dig>  while numerous genes involve in same pathways, e.g. brca_er_neg, brca_er_pos, stemcell_neural_up, and lei_myb_regulated_genes. this finding suggests that our minimized gene signatures are highly representative of multiple important pathways that may be involved in the biological processes underlying the discrimination of normal tissue from breast cancer samples. in that way, the rationale behind the phenomenon could be as follows: when some top-ranked overlapping probes are removed, the non-overlapping probes retain sufficient discriminatory power as the remaining probes could still stands for the majority of genes and pathways.

based on the essence of feasibility for the minimized methodology and biological functions inferred under similarity analyses, we further explored the rationale for the consistency and the diversity of the gene signatures. the gene signatures generated from different teams for the same clinical outcome are different from each other, with some failing to share any gene in common. the diversity could result from the use of different feature selection methods, classification algorithms etc. similarly, gene signatures for different clinical outcomes of same disease have been shown to exhibit little overlap between features  <cit> , this observation has been attributed to the use of multiple factors, such as different datasets, feature selection methods, classification algorithms sample sizes, and patient diversity  <cit> . the diversity of patients includes environmental effects, age and sex, disease stages, and patient health. in addition, genes involved at different disease stages or with different disease subtypes could also be different. furthermore, the assumptions  for the statistical models used in gene marker identification do not typically hold up given the small sample sizes and complexity of gene interactions.

despite of these complex issues, in some rare cases the predictive power of each model has been independently validated with large numbers of patients, and all have shown similar performance  <cit> .

models with better performance can be generated by probe redundancy reduction with the mfs process. several factors may contribute to this significance. first, the input for mfs are not all overlapping probes but probes with a sticker criterion which can minimize the random effect and improve the predictive power of signature, the reason behind this is that different dats have different modeling factors, which contain randomicity and are evaluated by maqc-ii  <cit> . besides, during the feature selection process, numerous different statistical strategies have been applied for this purpose, but those features in a gene signature were purely selected based on statistical significances, some of them may not have any relation to the studied endpoint phenotype but somehow are correlated to the genes related to the endpoint. those features may not have the positive contribution to the model performance but generate certain noise to interfere with the predictive ability. our method can identify those genes and exclude them from the minimized features, eventually, lead to improve the predictive power.

mfs method generally reduces redundancies for features within gene signatures and improves the performance of the model , which indicates the existence of consistency for the studying endpoint. clinical applications will benefit from the gene signature reduction, since the reduced size of gene signature with similar or better performance can increase the efficiency and reduce cost. meanwhile, most of the features remaining in the minimized gene signature tend to have a strong association with the disease and the application of those disease oriented features in diagnosis is more informative. to solve this problem, we use an mcc-robustness value  as a measurement for feature selection process and examine their biological functions through go term analysis. however, the predictive power of newly-generated classifiers depends on the quality of training and validation datasets, as well as the collected features and the selected classification algorithm. a newly generated gene signature by mfs would never perform well if the performance of its input signatures is not good.

mfs could benefit the clinical applications of microarray technology in several ways. firstly, it could improve the predictive power of signatures, which is a probable contribution to the implementation of personalized medicine; secondly, it minifies the number of probes in signatures, which can reduce cost for microarray's applications, and more important, it can avoid the weaknesses of large-size signatures: the insufficiency of sample, relevance among features, and the possible inaccuracy. thirdly, the similarity analyses can disclose the consistency and diversity among signatures for a disease, which is related to the essential of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
generally, our analyses of results from maqc-ii project indicate that gene signatures of both large and small sizes could perform equally well in clinical applications. in that way, it is reasonable to minimize the size of gene signatures. besides, biological significances can be inferred through similarity analyses, the results of which are the expected consistency for multiple gene signatures, reflecting the studying endpoints. mfs was developed following this principle. as a result, new classifiers built with minimized features based on similarity analyses can reflect breast cancer-related pathways, and can always have a smaller size and a significant predictive power. no doubt, the strategy could help the microarray-based clinical applications.
