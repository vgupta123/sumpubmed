BACKGROUND
wnt signaling has been implicated in mammary gland development  <cit> , particularly during the specification of mammary placodes from ectoderm   <cit> . our data have shown that lrp- <dig>  one of two canonical wnt signaling receptors, is required for ductal stem cell maintenance  <cit> . since several wnt family genes are differentially expressed in the virgin, pregnant, and lactating mammary gland, some of them regulated by ovarian hormones, it would not be surprising if these wnt proteins have other, as yet unidentified functions  <cit> .

during pregnancy, mammary glands undergo substantial changes induced by steroid and peptide hormones. progesterone signaling is predominantly responsible for the growth and differentiation of the lobuloalveolar lineage that is characteristic of early pregnancy  <cit> . brisken et al  concluded that wnt <dig> expression was important to side-branching and lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy, and was regulated by progesterone/pr signaling. thus, wnt <dig> null epithelium failed to form side-branches and lobuloalveoli in transplanted mammary fat pads during early pregnancy . early developmental defects were overcome in late stage of pregnancy  <cit> . in addition, wnt <dig> expression was induced in vitro in cultured mammary epithelial cells by estrogen and progesterone, and also in vivo in a progesterone-dependent manner during the estrus cycle  <cit> . thus wnt <dig> is considered a downstream mediator of progesterone/progesterone receptor -induced signaling.

wnt <dig> is key to several developmental processes. wnt <dig> null mice have no kidneys, due to early failure of the nephric mesenchymal-epithelial transition  <cit> . wnt <dig> is also key to establishing gonadal identity in females  <cit> . decidualization  is induced by progesterone/bmp <dig>  and requires wnt <dig>  <cit> . it is active during motorneuron specification   <cit> .

the molecular mechanism by which wnt <dig> induces proliferation and morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells has not been investigated. therefore, for the present study, we developed bi-transgenic mice that express wnt <dig> in mammary epithelial cells in response to tetracycline. by mating tet-operator driven wnt <dig> transgenic mice with mice expressing reverse tetracycline trans-activator  under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus -ltr promoter, we were able to induce expression of transgene in mammary glands by doxycycline administration. unexpectedly , ectopic wnt <dig> expression did not induce hyper side-branching and lobuloalveolar development in virgin mammary glands. this was despite clear evidence that wnt <dig>  a wnt <dig> transactivation target, was induced in response to tetracycline. thus, we propose that wnt <dig> is required but not sufficient for early lobuloalveolar side-branch development.

RESULTS
construction of tetracycline-inducible wnt <dig> transgene cassette and generation of doxycycline-inducible wnt <dig> transgenic mice
to construct a doxycycline-inducible wnt <dig> transgene cassette , mouse wnt <dig> cdna was subcloned downstream of tet operator sequences , and a minimal cmv promoter into the first cistron of a bicistronic construct. translation of a luciferase reporter gene via an internal ribosome entry site  can be used as a surrogate marker for transgene expression  <cit> . to test whether wnt <dig> and luciferase expression was regulated by doxycycline, the tmila-wnt <dig> plasmid was transfected into rtta-expressing 293t  cells, and lysates tested for luciferase activity and wnt <dig> protein level . this construct showed very low basal levels of both, that were highly induced by the administration of doxycycline .

two independent founder transgenic lines were made by pronuclear injection of the doxycycline-inducible wnt <dig> expression cassette  that stably transmitted the transgene to the next generation . southern blot analysis showed that both lines have > <dig> copies of transgene .

wnt <dig> expression is specifically induced in tet-wnt4/mmtv-rtta mammary glands by doxycycline-administration
in order to express wnt <dig> specifically in mammary gland, tet-wnt4a and b male mice were mated with mmtv-rtta female mice  <cit> . virgin 3~ <dig> month old bitransgenic  female mice and non- or single-transgenic female littermates were administered doxycyline-water  for one month, and luciferase activity in mammary tissue lysates was measured . luciferase reporter gene expression was induced in tet-wnt4a/mmtv-rtta or tet-wnt4b/mmtv-rtta mammary glands, but not in non-transgenic, tet-wnt4a, tet-wnt4b, or mmtv-rtta mammary glands.

to measure wnt <dig> expression directly in doxycyline-treated mammary glands, we measured wnt <dig> mrna level by real time quantitative pcr , and compared it with normal endogenous expression levels. consistent with previous reports  <cit> , wnt <dig> mrna was detected in juvenile and adult virgin mammary glands, and the expression level reached a peak during early pregnancy ) declining  during mid and late pregnancy. in both doxycycline-administered tet-wnt4a/mmtv-rtta and tet-wnt4b/mmtv-rtta mammary glands, wnt <dig> mrna level was higher than early pregnant mammary glands. wnt <dig> mrna was induced to early pregnant levels in mice in estrus , consistent with a previous report of wnt <dig> mrna induction after hormonal exposure  <cit> .

in order to assess induction of wnt <dig> protein expression, primary mammary epithelial cells were prepared from tet-wnt4a/mmtv-rtta female mice or non-transgenic female littermates and cultured in the presence or absence of doxycycline. wnt <dig> protein was only detected in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mammary epithelial cells . taken together, these data show that the expression of this wnt <dig> transgene is effectively induced by doxycyline.

ectopic wnt <dig> expression is not sufficient to induce hyper side-branching
to assess whether ectopic wnt <dig> expression induced side branching and lobuloalveolar growth, we examined whole mount preparations of doxycyline-administered mammary glands . surprisingly, neither tet-wnt4a/mmtv-rtta nor tet-wnt4b/mmtv-rtta mammary glands were significantly different from controls. control glands that displayed relatively more side-branches and lobuloalveolar development  were subsequently shown to have estrus-associated levels of wnt  <dig> mrna.

shorter or longer periods of doxycycline administration , or constant administration from embryonic stages in utero or from  <dig> weeks old to  <dig> months old also did not induce side-branch development in bitransgenic mammary glands . there were no overt changes in early morphogenesis during pregnancy, or during the first  <dig> days of pseudo-pregnancy . in line with their normal virgin morphology, the mitotic indices of these bitransgenic glands were also normal . we conclude that ectopic wnt <dig> expression is not sufficient to induce hyper side-branching.

wnt <dig> does not induce canonical wnt signaling reporter gene expression in mammary epithelial and fibroblast cells in vitro
recent studies suggest that the receptor species available determine the wnt signaling responses, rather than any particular wnt ligand  <cit> . thus, wnt ligands can induce so-called "canonical" wnt signaling by forming a tertiary complex with frizzled and lrp-5/ <dig>  while non-canonical wnt signaling pathways are mediated through frizzled alone or atypical receptor tyrosine kinases such as ryk and ror  <cit> .

to evaluate whether mammary epithelial cells in culture could respond to wnt <dig> with the activation of canonical wnt signaling, we measured wnt transactivation using a tcf-β catenin reporter assay. primary mammary epithelial cells  were transfected with wnt ligand expression plasmids together with the supertop-flash reporter plasmid . wnt <dig>  a commonly used inducer of canonical wnt signaling in mammary gland, was used as a positive control. although ectopic wnt <dig> expression induced reporter gene expression in mammary epithelial cells, wnt <dig> did not . the specificity of this reporter gene assay was confirmed using a scrambled superfop-flash reporter plasmid .

though it is known that the effects of wnt <dig> are epithelial cell-autonomous , the responder/effector cells do not necessarily have to be epithelial. therefore, we tested the canonical response of mammary fibroblast cells . again, we showed that reporter gene expression was easily induced by wnt <dig> in a dose dependent manner, but not by wnt <dig>  therefore, we conclude that wnt <dig> is not a canonical effector in either cell context.

wnt <dig> is biologically active
the lack of functional activity associated with wnt <dig> in these in vivo and in vitro analyses led us to examine whether the wnt <dig> expression vector was generating biologically active protein. zebrafish embryos have long been used to study the role of various wnt ligands during development, and the expression pattern and functionality of wnt ligands is remarkably highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish. ectopic misexpression of zebrafish wnt <dig>  during embryogenesis has been characterized. at  <dig> hours, zwnt <dig> mrna-injected embryos display phenotypes  that arise from an inhibition of convergence and extension movement  <cit> .

taking advantage of this, we injected mouse wnt <dig>  mrna  into fertilized zebrafish embryos  and examined the gain of function phenotypes after 24~ <dig> hours. as predicted by the fact that mwnt <dig> and zwnt <dig> share over 80% identity in amino acid sequences, ectopic misexpression of mwnt <dig> displayed similar gain of function phenotypes to those previously reported zwnt4-induced phenotypes, including cyclopia, shortened tail and trunk, and abnormalities in brain , thought to be the result of abnormal cell movement. furthermore, phenotypes induced by mwnt <dig> were different from mwnt <dig>  although ectopic misexpression of mwnt <dig> also displayed developmental abnormalities in brain and shortened trunk and tail, mwnt <dig> induced unique dorsalization phenotypes such as "tail-up" and "bustled"  <cit> . we classified the gain of function phenotypes into  <dig> groups , and quantified the phenotypes induced by different mrna injection doses . the quantification showed that both wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> induced the gain of function phenotypes in a dose dependent manner. thus, we confirm that mouse wnt <dig> is a biologically active protein that generates distinct phenotypes from wnt <dig>  receptors).

wnt <dig> expression is induced by wnt <dig> signaling
our data show that although biologically active wnt <dig> proteins are expressed in bitransgenic mammary glands, there is no significant development of lobuloalveoli. on the other hand, we confirmed that endogenous wnt <dig> expression, associated with increased progesterone during the estrus cycle, correlates with transient side-branching development  <cit> .

we presume that progesterone-regulated genes may include both a ligand and receptor pair. to test whether a cognate receptor  proteins) was missing in virgin transgenic mice compared to pregnant glands, we assessed the expression levels of fzd family genes using wnt signaling-specific qpcr-based array  analyses. the wnt signaling specific array has  <dig> primer sets that include most wnt signaling components and some housekeeping controls. we compared gene expression in early pregnant glands with that of transgenic doxycycline-administered tet-wnt4/mmtv-rtta glands and control virgin glands . only a few genes are significantly up- or down-regulated in early pregnant  glands or bitransgenic glands compared with virgin glands . prominent amongst these was wnt <dig> . furthermore, contrary to our hypothesis, although one fzd species, fzd <dig>  increased in pregnant glands, it increased more in wnt4:rtta transgenic glands, and there were no other significant and reproducible changes in other fzd family genes .

however, this analysis showed that the wnt <dig> target gene, wnt <dig>   <cit>  was induced by 13-fold and 55-fold in pregnant and transgenic glands respectively . we conclude that there is a wnt4-binding receptor that signals a response in virgin gland.

in order to determine whether wnt <dig> was a direct target of wnt <dig> signaling in mammary epithelial cells, hc <dig> cells were either transduced with recombinant retroviruses encoding wnt signaling agonists, or they were treated with conditioned medium from control  or wnt3a- l cells, and total rnas were prepared for qpcr analyses. interestingly, wnt <dig> expression was induced by canonical wnt signaling effectors , and wnt3a) but not directly by wnt <dig> . we tested whether co-addition of progesterone with wnt <dig> would induce wnt <dig> in hc <dig> cells, but it did not . notice that axin <dig>  a robust wnt signaling reporter  <cit> , was not significantly induced in either the wnt4:rtta or pregnant glands . we cannot conclude whether wnt <dig> is a canonical or non-canonical signaling target in mammary epithelial cells in vivo.

discussion
in order to study the published growth-associated activity of wnt <dig> in vivo during mammary gland development, we generated bitransgenic mice that express wnt <dig> in mammary glands in a doxycyline-inducible manner. perhaps surprisingly, we show that despite high levels of biologically active wnt <dig> in these transgenic mammary glands, there is no induction of lobuloalveoar side branching. we propose that wnt <dig> may be necessary but not sufficient for morphogenesis.

wnt <dig> is not sufficient for lobuloalveolar development
a role for wnt <dig> in lobuloalveolar development was first proposed by bradbury et al.  <cit> . this study used recombinant retroviruses encoding wnt <dig> under the control of β-actin promoter, to express wnt <dig> ectopically in mammary epithelial cells in culture. when transplanted in vivo into fat pads, the transduced mammary epithelial cells developed highly branched ducts. however, only 18% of the reconstituted glands displayed the "pregnant-like" phenotype, while 55% of the reconstituted glands had normal virgin mammary gland structures. the authors proposed that this might be the result of a low infection efficiency or low dose of wnt <dig> protein. it could be that retroviral transduction favors fibroblasts and endothelial cells, and that these cells modify the colonization pattern of mammary epithelial cells, without having a robust effect.

alternatively, it is possible that wnt <dig> may induce ductal side-branching only in the presence of the correct endocrine environment. thus, there is evidence that progesterone induces wnt <dig> expression  <cit> . the hormone-induced program includes many different subprograms, and we propose that a cooperating factor is required for wnt4-induced development. a good candidate as this cooperating factor is the b-hlh protein, id <dig>  one of the main factors induced in vivo by progesterone-exposure of pr-expressing luminal cells  <cit> . loss of function of id <dig> induces hypomorphic side-branching , and gain of function induces hyperplasia . the requirement of other progesterone-induced factor in addition to wnt <dig> during lobuloalveolar development is shown in summary in fig.  <dig>  another formal possibility to explain a lack of physiological response is that the relatively higher levels of wnt <dig>  we observe in transgenic glands  is too high, or that the wnt <dig> protein is unavailable to the responder cells .s

to study the effect of loss of wnt <dig> function, brisken et al. transplanted mammary rudimentary epithelium isolated from wnt <dig> null pups on the cleared fat pads  in vitro  <cit> , or stabilize endogenous β-catenin  <cit> . consistent with those observations, we have shown that wnt <dig> had no effect on supertop-flash reporter gene expression in primary mammary epithelial cells and mammary fibroblast cells . moreover, injection of mouse wnt <dig> to zebrafish embryos induced similar phenotypes to zwnt <dig>  classified in the same functional group as wnt5a, a prototype agonist of non-canonical wnt signaling  <cit> . however, recent studies have shown that when provided with correct species of frizzled and sufficient lrp protein, wnt5a can act as a canonical agonist  <cit> . indeed, wnt <dig> activates canonical responses in mdck kidney cells, and binds fzd <dig>  though this receptor is unlikely to be signaling receptor  <cit> . receptor context is therefore key to the functional readout.

often, wnt4-dependent physiologies involve more than one cell type. for example, wnt <dig> is required for tubulogenesis during kidney development , and is induced in mesenchymal cells by an epithelial cell-derived signal  <cit> . wnt <dig> expression induced the canonical reporter gene  in mesenchymal cells  <cit> , and ectopic β-catenin expression was sufficient to replace wnt4-mediated signaling  <cit> . in a renal injury model, wnt <dig> was able to stabilize endogenous β-catenin and induce reporter gene expression in certain myofibroblast cell lines  <cit> . furthermore, wnt <dig> activated canonical signaling in mdck  cells  <cit> . however, other data suggests that wnt <dig> inhibited canonical signaling by redirecting the subcellular localization of β catenin  <cit> , or that it is key to hematopoiesis through a β catenin-independent activity  <cit> . these data show that although wnt <dig> can function as a canonical signaling agonist in complex cell systems, it has other activities. interestingly, expression of wnt <dig>  in mammary ductal epithelial cells through either mmtv-ltr promoter or recombinant retrovirus also causes hyper side-branching that cannot be recapitulated by expression of the downstream intracellular transactivator, β-catenin  <cit> . these observations support the idea that canonical signaling activation by soluble wnt ligands in nearby mesenchymal cells through a paracrine mechanism is necessary for ductal side-branching morphogenesis  <cit> .

using qpcr-based array analyses, we found that wnt <dig> expression is induced by wnt <dig> in vivo . furthermore, a recent study showed that expression of both wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> is regulated by pr and foxo <dig>  during differentiation of endometrial stromal cells into decidual cells  <cit> . thus, knockdown of foxo <dig> using small interfering rnas down-regulates wnt <dig> and wnt <dig> expression, and knockdown of pr disrupts the regulation of wnt <dig> by foxo <dig> in human endometrial stromal cells. these data indicate that wnt <dig> is a downstream target gene of pr-wnt <dig> signaling axis. interestingly, however, our data also show that ectopic wnt4-wnt <dig> expression is not sufficient to induce side-branching development, suggesting that other cooperating factors need to be provided. taken together, we propose that pr signaling activates not only wnt4-wnt <dig> expression, but also other cooperating factors, and the orchestrated crosstalk is required for lobuloalveolar development during early pregnancy .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that wnt <dig> expression may be necessary, but is not sufficient, to induce lobuloalveolar development. we suggest that progesterone-induced collaborating factors may be required for wnt4-mediated mammary gland morphogenesis.
