BACKGROUND
various bacteria, most prominently belonging to the orders bacillales, pseudomonadales or actinomycetales, use non-ribosomal peptide synthesis  to produce peptides or other small molecules. these molecules exhibit broad structural diversity and display biological activities that range from adaptation to unfavorable environments, communication or competition with other microorganisms in their natural habitat, or even to action as virulence factors . non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  are megaenzymes, usually with a multimodular structure, that catalyze the non-ribosomal assembly of peptides from proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids  <cit> . a basic module consists of an adenylation domain  responsible for amino acid activation; a peptidyl carrier protein domain —usually adjacent to the a-domain—for thioesterification of the activated amino acid; a condensation domain , which performs transpeptidation between the upstream and downstream peptidyl and amino acyl thioesters to elongate the growing peptide chain. in addition to this basic subset of core domains, each nrps system also has a chain-terminating thioesterase domain  that is responsible for detachment of the mature polypeptide. typically, nrps initiation modules lack a c-domain  <cit> . the exceptions are initiation modules of nrps involved in biosynthesis of cyclic lipopeptides  <cit> . c-domains present in these initiation modules catalyze n-acylation of the first amino acid with a fatty acid . phylogenetic analyses of c-domains in nrpss showed that c-domains of initiation modules, termed starter c-domains, segregate in a separate phylogenetic clade distant from the c-domains of elongation nrps modules  <cit> . in addition to the essential domains mentioned above , optional auxiliary domains such as epimerization  or heterocyclization  domains can be found within some nrps modules. commonly, epimerization domains are located c-terminally of pcp-domains and perform epimerization of the last amino acid of the adjacent peptidyl-thioester. interestingly, biochemical data showed that c-domains involved in assembly of arthrofactin not only catalyze transpeptidation between the upstream peptidyl thioester and the downstream amino acyl thioester, but also catalyze epimerization of the last amino acid from the upstream peptidyl thioester from l into d configuration  <cit> . these c-domains have been termed dual c/e domains  <cit> . phylogenetic analyses of c-domains in nrpss also showed that dual c/e domains segregate in a separate phylogenetic clade  <cit> . because of their wide structural complexity and diversity, natural products synthesized by nrpss constitute a nearly inexhaustible source of new small molecules that might yield lead compounds in drug discovery  <cit> .

the a-domains are the gatekeepers of biosynthesis of the polypeptide due to the specificity of substrate binding pockets of nrpss for their cognate substrates. compared to the  <dig> proteinogenic amino acids used in ribosomal protein synthesis, the utilization of hundreds of different non-proteinogenic amino acids has been described for nrps. each substrate binding pocket of nrpss is specific for its amino acid substrate, and predictive models based on domain arrangement and on the sequence of modules have been deduced. the predictive power of these models has been refined from sequence analyses of nrps a-domains with known specificity combined with examples of crystal structures of a-domains  <cit> , thus identifying amino acid residues crucial for a-domain specificity. these models postulate specificity-conferring signatures for nrps a-domains consisting of ten critical amino acid residues putatively involved in amino acid or aryl acid substrate specificity. the number of nrps modules and their domain organization within the enzymes determine the structure of the final peptide product. using in silico analyses of the nrps genes, these conserved features within the nrps machinery allow prediction of the type, and sometimes even the structure, of the synthesized polypeptide. it is therefore possible to investigate the biosynthetic potential of a given bacterium by analysis of the architecture of its nrps gene clusters.

the transfer of a phosphopantetheinyl group to pcp-domains is required for posttranslational activation of nrpss. inactive apo-nrpss are converted to their active holo-forms by transfer of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl  moiety of coenzyme a to the sidechain hydroxyl of a serine residue in the pcp-domains. the p-pant moiety serves to tether covalently the growing polypeptide being assembled by nrpss. transfer of the p-pant moiety from coenzyme a to a serine residue is catalyzed by 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase . pptases are involved not only in posttranslational activation of nrps but also in posttranslational activation of fatty acid and polyketide synthases that do not contain pcp-domains but instead have acyl carrier protein  domains. all pptases are recognized by a common signature sequence gd …x40-45… xkexxk, but overall sequence similarities are low  <cit> . carrier protein specificity  has been determined experimentally for some pptases. for example, in escherichia coli, the entd pptase involved in biosynthesis of the siderophore enterobactin was shown experimentally to be active only on pcp-domains and not on acp-domains  <cit> .

the xanthomonadaceae are a family of gram-negative bacteria belonging to the order xanthomonadales in the gamma subdivision of the proteobacteria <cit> . members of this family are typically characterized as environmental organisms, and occupy diverse ecological niches such as soil and water, as well as plant tissues. many xanthomonadaceae, especially species from the genera xanthomonas and xylella, cause plant diseases, and only one, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, is known to be an opportunistic human pathogen. the genus xanthomonas consists of  <dig> plant-associated species, many of which cause important diseases of crops or ornamental plants. individual species comprise multiple pathovars, characterized by distinctive host specificity or mode of infection. collectively, members of this genus cause diseases on at least  <dig> monocotyledonous and  <dig> dicotyledonous crop plants.

xanthomonas albilineans is a systemic, xylem-invading pathogen that causes leaf scald—a lethal disease of sugarcane   <cit> . leaf scald symptoms vary from a single, white, narrow, sharply defined stripe to complete wilting and necrosis of infected leaves, leading to plant death. the only pathogenicity factor of x. albilineans to be extensively studied to date is albicidin—a secreted non-ribosomally synthesized peptide with phytotoxic and antibiotic properties  <cit> . albicidin is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor with a novel mode of action  <cit> . albicidin targets chloroplastic dna gyrase a, inhibits chloroplast dna replication and blocks chloroplast differentiation, resulting in the white foliar stripe symptoms  <cit> . albicidin also targets bacterial dna gyrase a and, as a consequence, exhibits a potent antibiotic activity against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . this antibiotic activity may help x. albilineans to combat rival microorganisms during sugarcane invasion. the complete albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster, called xalb <dig>  was cloned and sequenced from x. albilineans strain xa23r <dig>  <cit> . xalb <dig> encodes three large nrps genes and also resistance, regulatory and tailoring genes  <cit> . a pptase gene, annotated as xaba or albxxi, was shown to be required for albicidin biosynthesis in x. albilineans strains ls <dig> and xa23r <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the e. coli entd gene restored the biosynthesis of albicidin in a xaba knockout mutant of x. albilineans strain ls <dig>  <cit> , demonstrating that xaba  has the same pptase activity as entd, which is active only on pcp-domains. preliminary analyses by nuclear magnetic resonance  spectroscopy and mass spectrometry  did not allow the determination of the structure of albicidin  <cit> . however, these studies showed that albicidin contains about  <dig> carbon atoms and has an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> da. in silico analyses of xalb <dig> provided further insights into the structure of this pathotoxin, and suggested that nrpss involved in biosynthesis of albicidin incorporate as yet unknown non-proteinogenic substrates  <cit> . thus, the accumulated data obtained for albicidin and its biosynthesis gene cluster suggest that it is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor with a novel mode of action, and therefore might constitute a lead structure for novel antibiotics.

the genome of x. albilineans strain gpe pc <dig> was recently sequenced  <cit> . this genome contains, in addition to three nrps genes encoding albicidin biosynthesis  <cit> , seven novel nrps genes that share similarities with nrps genes present in the genomes of two recently sequenced american xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains  <cit> . these novel nrps genes cannot be assigned to any structure or function since there are no orthologous genes in other bacteria. interestingly, x. oryzae possesses an ortholog of the pptase gene xaba  which is hereafter referred to as xapptase because of its occurence in two species of xanthomonas.

x. oryzae pathovars are the causal agents of two important diseases of rice: bacterial leaf blight caused by x. oryzae pv. oryzae, and bacterial leaf streak caused by x. oryzae pv. oryzicola. the xapptase gene is found in all six genome sequences of x. oryzae published to date . the presence of the xapptase gene in all six genomes indicates that all strains of x. oryzae likely possess nrps genes and produce non-ribosomally synthesized peptides.

the objective of this study was to estimate the biosynthetic potential of x. albilineans and x. oryzae by in silico analyses of their uncharacterized nrps gene clusters and to identify other bacterial candidates for extended genome mining by pcr screening of a collection of  <dig> plant pathogenic bacteria for the presence of the xapptase gene and other nrps-associated genes. to complete available published genomic data, we included in our analyses unpublished draft genome sequences of the african x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain bai <dig> isolated in burkina faso  <cit>  and the xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig> isolated in guadeloupe . to date, no genome sequence of an african x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain is available in public databases but a draft sequence of the genome of african strain axo <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzae was used recently to identify candidate type iii secretion system effector genes  <cit> . xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig> was isolated from the surface of a sugarcane leaf and was characterized initially as a member of the species x. albilineans <cit> . however, recent mlsa  analyses showed that this strain, which does not possess the albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster, is close to x. albilineans but belongs to a separate phylogenetic clade .

RESULTS
features of the xapptase genes in x. albilineans and x. oryzae
in strains ls <dig>  xa23r <dig> and gpe pc <dig> of x. albilineans, as well as in the xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig>  the xapptase gene is located between the rpsf gene encoding the 30s ribosomal protein s <dig>  and a gene encoding an iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein . these latter two genes are conserved and contiguous in other sequenced species of xanthomonas. in all sequenced strains of x. oryzae, including strain bai <dig>  the xapptase gene is located in a region containing several trna genes and phage-related sequences . in strain bls <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola, this region also contains two large nrps genes that are partially conserved and located in the same region in strain  <dig> of xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri . however, the xapptase gene is not conserved in strain  <dig>  the region between the trna genes does not contain any genes in several other species of xanthomonas , suggesting that xapptase and/or nrps genes were acquired by lateral gene transfer.

the xapptase genes from x. albilineans and x. oryzae, which are located in two different genomic regions, share only 51% amino acid similarity, although their pptase signature sequences are very similar . the reciprocal best blast hit in genbank for the xapptase gene of x. albilineans is the xapptase gene from x. oryzae. this indicates that these genes might have been derived from a common ancestor. signature sequences of all xapptase genes are very similar to the signature sequence of entd gene of e. coli . x. albilineans and x. oryzae possess another pptase gene, heti, which is conserved in all sequenced species of xanthomonas. signature sequences of heti of x. albilineans and x. oryzae are both similar to the signature sequence of a pptase of mycobacterium tuberculosis that was shown experimentally to be active only on acp-domains of fatty acid and polyketide synthases and not on pcp-domains  <cit>  .

xapptase proteins of strains ls <dig> and xa23r <dig> of x. albilineans are 100% identical, but they are only 94% and 83% identical to xapptase proteins of strains gpe pc <dig> and xas <dig>  respectively. however, xapptase signatures are 100% identical in strains ls <dig>  xa23r <dig> and gpe pc <dig>  differing only in one amino acid residue in strain xas <dig> .

genome mining reveals three novel nrps loci in the genome of x. albilineans strain gpe pc73
in addition to the three nrps genes characterized previously as being involved in the biosynthesis of albicidin  <cit> , the chromosome of strain gpe pc <dig> possesses seven large multimodular nrps genes clustered in three loci, hereafter referred to as meta-a, meta-b and meta-c, respectively. these non-characterized nrps genes share no similarity with nrps genes from the biosynthesis gene cluster of albicidin.

interestingly, the loci meta-a and meta-c encode nrpss only, and no nrps-associated proteins, e.g. tailoring enzymes, in the proximity of these gene clusters. meta-a is adjacent to the albicidin nrps gene cluster xalb <dig>  from which it is separated by the terminus of replication. meta-a, which is flanked by is elements, includes two large nrps genes: xalc_ <dig>  and xalc_ <dig> . these two genes encode a nrps system consisting of  <dig> modules each containing the characteristic domain arrangement c-a-pcp. a te-domain is located at the c-terminus of xalc_ <dig> . meta-c, which is not flanked by is elements, contains a single nrps gene, xalc_ <dig> . this gene encodes a nrps system consisting of seven modules with a c-a-pcp domain arrangement, followed by a chain-terminating te-domain . phylogenetic analysis of c-domains revealed that the c-domains of the first modules of xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig> cluster in a separate clade, distinct from that of the starter c-domains identified by rausch et al.  <cit>  in numerous bacteria . this indicates that these two starter c-domains, which share 81% amino acid similarity, are unusual. the reciprocal best blast hit in genbank for both starter c-domains of meta-a and meta-c is the n-terminal c-domain of a nrps gene belonging to the plant-associated bacterium bradyrhizobium spp. strain btai  <cit> .

the meta-b biosynthesis gene cluster of strain gpe pc <dig> contains four nrps genes: xalc_ <dig> , xalc_ <dig> , xalc_ <dig>  and xalc_ <dig>  . these four genes encode a nrps system consisting of a total of  <dig> modules with a continuous c-a-pcp domain arrangement. two te-domains were identified in meta-b:  a single te-domain at the c-terminus of the nrps xalc_ <dig>  and  one double te-domain on its own encoded by a separate gene  . like the domain arrangement of meta-a and meta-c, only essential elongation domains  were identified in meta-b. phylogenetic analysis showed that the c-domain of the first module of xalc_ <dig> belongs to the same clade as starter c-domains identified by rausch et al.  <cit> , indicating that it also corresponds to a starter c-domain . therefore, the first module of xalc_ <dig> was assigned as the initiation module of meta-b . the last module of xalc_ <dig>  which harbors a te domain, was assigned as the termination module . xalc_ <dig> is the only gene available in genbank to encode a ‘stand-alone’ double te domain, indicating that this gene is not associated to any nrps system and should be considered as a pseudogene.

in addition to these four nrps genes, the meta-b locus encodes an abc transporter , an arac transcriptional regulator  and a mbth-like protein . the abc transporter likely is the corresponding transporter for secretion of small molecule synthesized by meta-b. the arac protein may be required for specific transcriptional regulation of genes present in meta-b. finally, the mbth-like protein shares similarities with proteins involved in biosyntheses of non-ribosomal peptides recently described in other bacteria  <cit> . some genes in the meta-b gene cluster are predicted to be required for the biosyntheses of three non-proteinogenic amino acids: an unidentified β-hydroxy-amino acid,  <dig> -diamino butyric acid , and  <dig> -dihydroxyphenyl-glycine . xalc_ <dig> shares 52% amino acid similarity with stam, which was assigned in streptomyces toyocaensis as the gene responsible for β-hydroxylation of amino acids, preferably tyrosine  <cit> . the protein encoded by xalc_ <dig> is 52% similar to a diaminobutyrate transaminase characterized in acinetobacter baumannii as catalyzing the conversion of aspartate semialdehyde  to dab  <cit> . genes predicted to be required for biosynthesis of dpg share high similarities with genes previously characterized in amycolatopsis balhimycina <cit>  and s. toyocaensis <cit> , respectively . based on these similarities, xalc_ <dig> is predicted to encode a polyketide synthase  that may generate  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylacetyl-coa from four molecules of malonyl-coa, with the assistance of xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig> . xalc_ <dig> is predicted to encode dioxygenase dpgc, which may convert  <dig> -dihydroxyphenylacetyl-coa into  <dig> -dihydroxyphenyl-glyoxylate, and subsequently generate dpg after transamination by xalc_ <dig> .

* this function was characterized for biosynthesis of vancomycin  <cit> .

the identity of several amino acids recognized and activated by the nrpss of meta-a, meta-b or meta-c is predicted on the basis of the analysis of specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains . interestingly, signatures specific to dab were identified in both loci meta-a and meta-c, but remarkably not in the locus of meta-b, which encodes the gene required for biosynthesis of dab . this finding suggests the occurrence of cross-talk between the three nrps loci. four unknown substrate specificity-conferring signatures were identified in the nrpss of meta-a, meta-b or meta-c . phylogenetic analysis of c-domains also showed that c-domains of two modules of meta-a, four modules of meta-b and one module of meta-c segregate in the same clade as dual c/e domains identified by rausch et al.  <cit>  in numerous bacteria . by analogy to previously identified dual c/e domains from arthrofactin nrps, these latter dual c/e domains are predicted to follow modules that assemble amino acids with d-configuration .

genome mining reveals short nrps genes in the genome of strains gpe pc <dig> and xas3
two short nrps genes are also present on the chromosome of strain gpe pc <dig> in two additional loci. these two short nrps genes, xalc_ <dig>  and xalc_ <dig> , each encode only one nrps module, with a c-a-pcp-te domain arrangement, and overlap at their 3′ end with a glycosyltransferase gene . xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig> share 66% amino acid similarity but do not share the same substrate-specificity conferring signature . xalc_ <dig> harbors a signature specific to gly, and xalc_ <dig> harbors an unknown signature that differs from unknown signatures identified in other nrps loci of strain gpe pc <dig>  their respective overlapping glycosyltransferase genes  share 62% amino acid similarity . the c-domains of these two short nrps genes segregate in the same phylogenetic clade as starter c-domains identified by rausch et al.  <cit> . genes similar to the short nrps genes of strain gpe pc <dig>  i.e. encoding only one nrps module with a c-a-pcp-te domain arrangement and overlapping a glycosyltransferase gene at their 3′-end, were found in the genome of the marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium alcanivorax borkumensis strain sk <dig> . interestingly, in this strain, a xapptase-like gene  is contiguous with the glycosyltransferase gene  and the short nrps gene , confirming that a pptase specific to pcp-domains is required for the unknown function of these unusually small nrps systems. similar short nrps genes were found in the genome of two other species of xanthomonas, which nevertheless do not possess the xapptase gene . this indicates that these genes were present in the common ancestor of xanthomonas but may have conserved their function only in species that conserved the xapptase gene. short nrps genes were not found in any sequenced strains of x. oryzae, including strain bai <dig>  however, orthologs of these genes were found in xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig>  the only short nrps gene present in strain xas <dig> shares 94% and 67% amino acid similarity with the two short nrps genes xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig> of strain gpe pc <dig>  respectively, and exhibits the same gly-specificity conferring signature as in xalc_ <dig> . the overlapping glycosyltransferase gene of the short nrps gene of strain xas <dig> shares 92% and 62% amino acid similarity with the two glycosyltransferase genes xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig>  respectively, of strain gpe pc <dig> .

genome mining uncovers a meta-b-like nrps gene cluster in strains x11-5a, bai <dig> and xas3
genes similar to those from the gene cluster meta-b of strain gpe pc <dig> were found in the recently published  <cit>  draft genome sequences of the two x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains x11-5a and x8-1a, and in unpublished draft genome sequences of xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig> and x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain bai <dig>  in these draft sequences, fragments of nrps genes were distributed in several independent contigs. blast analyses indicated that the meta-b gene cluster was very similar in strains x11-5a and x8-1a. we therefore analyzed only strain x11-5a . for strains x11-5a and xas <dig>  in silico analyses were performed directly on the draft sequence by analyzing each contig independently. for strain bai <dig>  we performed additional cloning and sequencing experiments to assemble the contigs and determine the complete sequence of an 82-kb region containing meta-b.

all nrps-associated genes found in the meta-b gene cluster of strain gpe pc <dig> are conserved in strains bai <dig>  x11-5a and xas <dig> , except for xalc_ <dig> , which is absent in strain bai <dig>  interestingly, the meta-b loci of strains x11-5a and xas <dig> both contain four additional genes that may be required for the biosynthesis of additional unknown non-proteinogenic amino acids . these genes encode a protein sharing 58% amino acid similarity with the protein encoded by the stam gene of s. toyocaensis , a transaminase , a lactate dehydrogenase  and a hypothetical protein , respectively. this hypothetical protein has a superfamily domain that is found in a variety of structurally related metalloproteins, including type i extradiol dioxygenases, glyoxalase i and a group of antibiotic resistance proteins. orthologs of this hypothetical protein  and of the transaminase  are present in a nrps gene cluster in the genome of the phytopathogenic strain ech <dig> of dickeya dadantii, supporting the assumption that both genes are required for biosynthesis of non-ribosomally synthesized peptides. orthologs of the hypothetical protein dd703_ <dig> are also present in the three asian x. oryzae pv. oryzae strains maff  <dig>  pxo99a and kacc <dig> in the region containing the xapptase gene . this suggests that, in the common ancestor of x. oryzae strains, meta-b may have been already present in the same genomic region as the xapptase gene. contig  <dig>  of strain x11-5a, which contains the dat gene and the three additional genes mentioned above, also contains eight genes that are not predicted to be required for nrps on the basis of their sequence. these eight genes are conserved in all other x. oryzae strains but are present elsewhere in the genome . this finding supports the conclusion that recombination events had shaped the meta-b locus in the ancestor of strain x11-5a. remnants of the gene encoding the lactate dehydrogenase dh were found in strain gpe pc <dig> between genes xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig>  confirming its ancestral origin . in strain x11-5a, the meta-b locus contains a syrp gene sharing 44% amino acid similarity with the syrp gene of pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae strain b728a, which was shown to be required for β-hydroxylation of the aspartyl residue in the phytotoxin syringomycin e  <cit> . no aspartyl residue is predicted to be assembled by meta-b in strain x11-5a, suggesting that the syrp gene of strain x11-5a may be required for β-hydroxylation of another residue. in strain bai <dig>  the syrp gene should be considered as a pseudogene because it contains a non-sense mutation . the syrp gene is also not conserved in the meta-b loci of strains gpe pc <dig> or xas <dig>  however, in strain gpe pc <dig>  the albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster xalb <dig> does possess a syrp gene , which shares 42% and 49% amino acid similarity with the syrp gene of p. syringae pv. syringae and the syrp gene of strain x11-5a, respectively. the syrp gene xalc_ <dig> may be involved in β-hydroxylation of residues that are assembled by xalb <dig>  but also by meta-a, meta-b and meta-c.

dab:  <dig> -diamino butyric acid; dpg:  <dig> -dihydroxyphenyl-glycine.

c-domains very similar to the starter c-domain of the locus meta-b of strain gpe pc <dig> were found in strains xas <dig>  x11-5a and bai- <dig>  confirming that these three strains possess a nrps gene cluster similar to meta-b. additionally, a c-domain very similar to the starter c-domain of meta-a was found in another contig of strain xas <dig> . while sharing common characteristics, nrps genes present in loci meta-a, meta-b or meta-c in strains gpe pc <dig>  bai <dig>  x11-5a or xas <dig> are predicted to encode different nrps systems, each being strain-specific. nrps genes of each strain are described and discussed separately below.

genomic features of nrps genes associated with the meta-b gene cluster of strain bai3
the meta-b locus of african strain bai <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzae, which is situated next to a transcription activator-like  effector locus, contains three nrps genes: nrpsa , nrpsb  and nrpsc  . these three genes encode a nrps system consisting of  <dig> modules of the characteristic domain arrangement c-a-pcp. one double te-domain is present at the terminal module of nrpsa. phylogenetic analysis identified the n-terminally located c-domain of the first module of nrpsb as the starter c-domain . this c-starter domain shares 74% amino acid similarity with the starter c-domain of the meta-b locus of strain gpe pc <dig> . therefore, the first module of nrpsb was assigned as the initiation module and the last module of nrpsa, which harbors the te domain, was assigned as the termination module . phylogenetic analysis of c-domains identified four modules exhibiting a dual c/e domain that are predicted to follow modules that assemble an amino acid with d-configuration in strain bai <dig> .

the meta-b biosynthesis gene cluster of strain bai <dig> also contains a pseudogene consisting of three degenerated nrps modules that contain a frame-shift mutation or an insertion sequence, respectively . ten out of  <dig> amino acids assembled by the locus meta-b of strain bai <dig> were predicted on the basis of analysis of specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains . interestingly, one of the degenerated modules exhibits a signature specific to dab, suggesting that a putative ancestor of strain bai <dig> possessed the gene dat required for biosynthesis of dab. moreover, five unknown specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains were found in strain bai <dig>  remarkably, the meta-b locus is the only nrps locus identified in the whole genome of strain bai <dig> 

genomic features of nrps genes associated with the meta-b gene cluster of strain x11-5a
the contig  <dig>  of the american strain x11-5a of x. oryzae pv. oryzae contains several nrps-associated genes also present in the meta-b gene cluster of strain gpe pc <dig>  two contigs  of strain x11-5a each contain a nucleotide sequence encoding a chain-terminating te-domain located just upstream from a nucleotide sequence encoding a c-domain that shares more than 75% amino acid similarity with starter c-domains of the meta-b loci of strains gpe pc <dig> and bai <dig>  and which segregates in the same phylogenetic clade as these starter c-domains . therefore, both contigs  <dig>  and  <dig>  should belong to the meta-b locus, suggesting that, in strain x11-5a, this locus possesses two starter c-domains and two chain-terminating te domains, and consequently encodes two independent nrps systems that should be involved in the biosynthesis of two different compounds. the older ancestor of meta-b, considered similar to locus meta-b of strain x11-5a, likely also encoded two nrps systems. in strain bai <dig>  a pseudogene consisting of three degenerated nrps modules, as well as a syrp pseudogene, may be remnants of lost ancestral genes that were required for a second nrps system likely encoded by the older ancestor of meta-b. similarly, a pseudogene encoding a stand alone double te-domain in strain gpe pc <dig>  may be a remnant of a lost ancestral nrps gene that was required for a second nrps system. a total of  <dig> different nucleotide sequences encoding a-domains were found in all contigs of strain x11-5a . the absence of nucleotide sequences encoding a te-domain other than those encoded by contigs  <dig>  and  <dig>  suggests that all these  <dig> sequences encoding a-domains belong to the meta-b gene cluster of strain x11-5a. indeed, the total number of nucleotide sequences encoding a-domains belonging to this gene cluster may be even higher because of repeated dna regions that are not included in the draft genome sequence and that may encode additional a-domains. amino acids assembled by  <dig> of these  <dig> a-domains were predicted on the basis of specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains . seven unknown specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains were identified in strain x11-5a . phylogenetic analysis of c-domains identified six modules exhibiting dual c/e domains in this strain .

the nucleotide sequence of contig g <dig> of xanthomonas spp. strain xas <dig> encodes a te-domain located just upstream from a sequence encoding a starter c-domain. this c-domain shares more than 71% amino acid similarity with starter c-domains of the meta-b loci of strains gpe pc <dig> and bai <dig>  which segregate in the phylogenetic clade of starter c-domains . therefore, contig g <dig> should belong to the meta-b locus. contigs g <dig> and g <dig> are also predicted to belong to the meta-b gene cluster because they contain several nrps-associated genes specific to this locus . contig g <dig> contains the same gene as strain gpe pc <dig> encoding the stand alone double te-domain predicted to be a pseudogene . based on these resemblances with the meta-b locus of strain gpe pc <dig>  strain xas <dig> is predicted to possess a meta-b gene cluster  encoding one nrps system involved in the biosynthesis of one peptide. contig g <dig> of strain xas <dig> contains a starter c-domain located at the same position as the starter c-domain of locus meta-a of strain gpe pc <dig>  and downstream genes orthologous to xalc_ <dig> and xalc_ <dig> . this starter c-domain shares 82% amino acid similarity with the starter c-domain of the locus meta-a of strain gpe pc <dig> . contig g <dig> of strain xas <dig> contains an incomplete nrps gene encoding six nrps modules, with the last module containing a chain-terminating te domain. the 5′-part of this incomplete nrps gene is located in a region that does not encode any nrps in strain gpe pc <dig>  upstream from the orthologous gene of xalc_ <dig> . however, based on phylogenetic analyses of c-domains, strain xas <dig> possesses only two starter c-domains, indicating that contig g <dig> belongs to the same meta-a gene cluster as the starter c-domain of contig g <dig> . the 5′-part of meta-a in strain gpe pc <dig> is located upstream of both the terminus of replication and the albicidin biosynthesis gene cluster xalb <dig>  which is not present in the genome of strain xas <dig>  acquisition of xalb <dig> by the ancestor of x. albilineans or, alternatively, loss of xalb <dig> by the ancestor of strain xas <dig> may explain why the upstream segments of meta-a from strains gpe pc <dig> and xas <dig> are located in two different regions. a total of  <dig> different nucleotide sequences encoding a-domains were found in all contigs of strain xas <dig> : four of these are located in contig g <dig>  which contains nucleotide sequences encoding the chain-terminating te-domain and the starter c-domain of meta-b; and six are located in contig g <dig> containing the incomplete nrps gene of meta-a. the remaining  <dig> nucleotide sequences encoding a-domains, which are not located in contigs encoding te-domains, may belong either to meta-a or meta-b. the total number of nucleotide sequences encoding a-domains in strain xas <dig> may be higher than  <dig> because of repeated dna regions that are not included in the draft genome sequence and that may encode additional modules. amino acids assembled from  <dig> of these  <dig> a-domains were predicted on the basis of specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains . nine unknown specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains were found in strain xas <dig> . phylogenetic analysis identified nine modules exhibiting a dual c/e domain .

genome mining reveals a nrps gene cluster specific to x. oryzae pv. oryzicola strain bls256
in x. oryzae pv. oryzicola strain bls <dig>  the region containing the xapptase gene also contains two large nrps genes: xoc_ <dig>  and xoc_ <dig> . these two genes encode a nrps consisting of six modules each with the three domains  followed by a chain-terminating double te domain . only the a, pcp, c and te domains were identified and no auxiliary domains were found in this system. these genes are the only nrps genes present in strain bls <dig>  phylogenetic analysis of c-domains showed that the c-domain of the first module of xoc_ <dig> belongs to the same clade as starter c-domains identified by rausch et al.  <cit> . elongation modules of strain bls <dig>  that all exhibit a dual c/e domain, are predicted to catalyze epimerization of five amino acids . the double te-domain might catalyze cyclization of the peptide. orthologs of nrps genes of strain bls <dig>  which are present in x. axonopodis pv. citri strain  <dig>  are only partially conserved and do not encode a complete nrps system; these should be considered as pseudogenes .

genome mining of xanthomonas sacchari reveals genes required for biosynthesis of new non-ribosomal peptide
a non-annotated draft sequence of the genome of x. sacchari strain ncppb <dig>  isolated from an insect collected on a diseased banana plant, was published recently  <cit> . the species x. sacchari, which is phylogenetically related to x. albilineans, was also isolated on sugarcane and milled rice  <cit> . however, no disease caused by this species on any plant has been described to date. interestingly, the genome of x. sacchari strain ncppb <dig> contains the xapptase gene , which is not located at the same position as on the chromosomes of x. albilineans or x. oryzae. this genome also contains the genes dat , stam  and syrp . these three latter genes are clustered in a single locus. in addition, the genome of x. sacchari strain ncppb <dig> contains several contigs encoding nrps-related sequences, among them adenylation domains specific to dab, valine, glutamic acid, phenylalanine, asparagine, proline and an unknown substrate . however, the ncppb <dig> genome does not contain any sequences that are closely related to meta-a, meta-b, meta-c, xalb <dig> or the short nrps genes described above, indicating that non-ribosomal peptide potentially produced by x. sacchari is/are specific to this species.

genome mining by in silico analysis demonstrates a great biosynthetic potential for non-ribosomally synthesized peptides in the genus xanthomonas
while sharing numerous common characteristics, the meta-b gene clusters of all four investigated xanthomonas spp. strains do not encode identical small molecules. this was concluded from the a-domain specificities of the nrpss, and the hypothetical peptides are therefore considered strain-specific. starter c-domains of all four loci meta-b share at least 71% amino acid similarity  suggesting that, although there is currently no experimental evidence, they might be expected to effect n-acylation with a structurally related β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid. furthermore, the four meta-b loci exhibit several c/e dual domains, indicating that they catalyze the assembly of residues with d-configuration. blast analyses identified only  <dig> genbank entries that exhibit similar dual c/e domains. these  <dig> entries include nine genes analyzed in the present study . draft genome sequence data of strains xas <dig> and x11-5a did not indicate the number or distribution of residues in peptides assembled by their respective meta-b gene cluster. however, data clearly suggest that these peptides are specific to each strain. in strain x11-5a, the meta-b biosynthesis gene cluster is even predicted to control the biosynthesis of two different lipopeptides. a total of five different lipopeptides that do not resemble any compound described to date are predicted for the four xanthomonas spp. strains due to the presence of the meta-b gene cluster. these five lipopeptides could be secreted by the abc transporter encoded by orthologs of xalc_ <dig>  which are present in all meta-b gene clusters.

the only common characteristic shared between the loci meta-a and meta-c of strain gpe pc <dig> and the locus meta-a of strain xas <dig>  is their unusual starter c-domain, which segregates in a distant phylogenetic clade and shares less that 42% amino acid similarity with starter c-domains of meta-b loci or with starter c-domains identified in numerous bacteria by rausch et al.  <cit>  . these unusual starter c-domains might catalyze linkage of the first residue with a non-amino acid substrate. a total of three different compounds, not resembling any known compound, are predicted to be produced by xanthomonas spp. strains gpe pc <dig> and xas <dig> by the gene clusters meta-a or meta-c. short nrps genes of strain gpe pc <dig> might be involved in the biosynthesis of two different small molecules consisting of an amino acid  linked to a β-hydroxy-carboxylic acid and a glycosyl residue. the only short nrps gene of strain xas <dig> might be involved in biosynthesis of a small molecule identical to that synthesized by xalc_ <dig> because of the high similarity of these two genes. according to in silico analyses, strain bls <dig> could synthesize a cyclolipopeptide with the amino acid sequence d-asn-d-val-d-leu-d-thr-d-leu-l-val, which does not resemble any compound described to date . x. sacchari strain ncppb <dig> may also produce new non ribosomal peptide. transporters involved in secretion of these unknown compounds remain to be identified as they are not encoded by the nrps loci.

a total of  <dig> unknown specificity-conferring signatures of a-domains were found in the four strains gpe pc <dig>  xas <dig>  x11-5a and bai <dig>  only signatures “unknown2” and “unknown4” were found in a recently published database that includes  <dig>  adenylation domains with unknown signatures  <cit> . the other  <dig> unknown nrps signatures are not present in this database and could be specific to the genus xanthomonas. the signature “unknown1” is predicted to be specific for dpg because of its presence in all four strains and because of the absence in these strains of any signature similar to those specific to the non-proteinogenic amino acid identified by  <cit> . strains xas <dig> and x11-5a possess a higher number of unknown signatures, suggesting that the three genes specific to both strains  are involved in the biosynthesis of additional non-proteinogenic amino acids. however, these two strains share only one specific unknown signature , whereas some unknown signatures are shared by three strains . eight other unknown signatures are present in only one strain . “unknown5” was found only in the short gene xalc_ <dig> of strain gpe pc <dig>  the presence of a high number of unknown signatures specific to the genus xanthomonas suggests that numerous unknown non-proteinogenic amino acids are assembled by the novel nrps genes identified in the genome of the four xanthomonas spp. the biosynthetic capacities for those amino acids have yet to be identified. in conclusion, our results yield the expectation that numerous non-proteinogenic amino acids as well as residues with d-configuration should confer unusual structures to compounds synthesized by xanthomonas spp. strains; identification of these compounds represents an exciting area for future study in these organisms.

pcr screening of  <dig> plant pathogenic bacteria for the xapptase gene and genes associated to nrps in meta-b
a collection of  <dig> strains belonging to the main genera of plant-pathogenic bacteria was screened by pcr. primers designed to amplify dna fragments of the xapptase gene, the abc transporter gene present in meta-b, the dpgb gene, the dpgc gene, the hpgt gene and the dat gene, were designed . the xapptase gene was found in all analyzed strains of x. albilineans and x. oryzae. it was also found in strain cfbp <dig> of xanthomonas translucens pv. secalis, strain cfbp <dig> of xanthomonas cassavae, strain cfbp <dig> of pseudomonas corrugata, strain cfbp <dig> of pseudomonas brassicacearum and strain cfbp <dig> of xylophilus ampelinus . the xapptase gene of x. cassavae is very similar to that of x. oryzae, while the xapptase gene of p. corrugata is very similar to that of p. brassicacearum .

the abc transporter gene was found in all four analyzed strains of x. albilineans, in all five analyzed african strains of x. oryzae pv. oryzae, in strains upb <dig> and cfbp <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola and in strain cfbp <dig> of x. translucens pv. secalis . three additional genes of meta-b  were found in all strains possessing the meta-b abc transporter, except for strain cfbp <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola, which does not possess any of these genes . the dat gene was found in all analyzed strains of x. albilineans, in strain upb <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola and in strain cfbp <dig> of x. translucens pv. secalis . in summary, the meta-b gene cluster seems to be present in all analyzed strains of x. albilineans, in all analyzed african strains of x. oryzae pv. oryzae, in strain upb <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola and in strain cfbp <dig> of x. translucens pv. secalis.

CONCLUSIONS
this study analyzed published genome sequences of xanthomonas spp. together with unpublished draft genome sequences of xanthomonas spp. xas <dig> and x. oryzae pv. oryzae strain bai <dig> for their genetic capacity to producing small molecules. table  <dig> summarizes the in silico data on the non-ribosomally synthesized peptides predicted to be produced by these xanthomonas strains. unfortunately, because of the presence of unknown signatures and unusual starter c-domains, we were unable to predict possible structures of any of the products of the identified biosynthesis gene clusters. however, this study revealed that four strains of the genus xanthomonas possess up to three novel homologous gene clusters, termed meta-a, meta-b or meta-c, encoding nrps peptides. a phosphopantetheinyl transferase , which is essential for activation of nrps enzymes, was identified in all strains investigated. furthermore, sequence alignment of these meta-clusters from xanthomonas strains is indicative of the biosynthesis of lipopeptides or peptides linked to another non-amino acid substrate, and involving the biosynthesis and incorporation of non-proteinogenic amino acids dpg, dab and amino acid of unknown identity including at least one β-hydroxy-amino acid. the identity of several amino acids could not be predicted from the signature sequences of a-domain specificities. hence, at least eight different peptides may be synthesized, the partial sequences of which have been predicted. this study revealed that each peptidic sequence is strain-specific . this suggests that other xanthomonas spp. strains, although they all possess the meta-b locus, are expected to produce structurally different peptides, varying in size and amino acid composition. small molecules synthesized by other nrps genes analyzed in strain bls <dig> of x. oryzae pv. oryzicola, strain ncppb <dig> of x. sacchari and strain gpe pc <dig> of x. albilineans are also likely candidates for the biosynthesis of new metabolites from xanthomonas spp. strains . if these biosynthetic pathways are functional, the resulting peptides may exert different biological functions in plant–bacteria interactions. interestingly, these biosynthetic pathways seem to be shared only by strains of xanthomonas associated with monocotyledonous plants, suggesting a putative involvement of novel non-ribosomally synthesized peptides in plant–bacteria interactions. the xapptase gene might be a useful probe for further genome mining of xanthomonas spp. and related strains. in summary, this extensive in silico study shows that the genus xanthomonas constitutes a promising reservoir of new non-ribosomally synthesized peptides. experimental elucidation of this promising biosynthetic potential should contribute to the study of plant-bacteria interactions as well as to drug discovery. interestingly, a first step of this elucidation was recently achieved with the isolation of the lipopeptide synthesized by the gene cluster meta-b of x. albilineans strain gpe pc <dig>  the nominal molecular mass of this lipopeptide is  <dig>  da and subsequent ms/ms-experiments revealed an amino acid sequence which excellently matches the one predicted by in silico analysis of a-domain specificities of meta-b nrpss .
