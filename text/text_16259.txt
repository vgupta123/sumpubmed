BACKGROUND
theileria parva is an intracellular tick-transmitted protozoan parasite native to eastern, central, and southern africa, and the causative agent of east coast fever  in cattle. the vectors are ticks within the genus rhipicephalus, mainly r. appendiculatus, and the primary mammalian host is the african cape buffalo . while the african buffalo is an asymptomatic carrier of t. parva, cattle are evolutionarily recent hosts and typically succumb rapidly to the disease  <cit> . the parasite, which is transmitted as a sporozoite during tick feeding, invades lymphocytes of buffalo and cattle. in infected lymphocytes, the parasite divides in synchrony with the host cells while inducing uncontrolled proliferation and ‘immortalization’ of the host cells. later in the course of the infection, t. parva undergoes merogony resulting in lysis of transformed host cells, and finally the differentiation into the piroplasm stage. development of the piroplasm stage occurs in red blood cells, which are ingested during tick feeding, completing the developmental cycle. within the tick, the parasite undergoes sexual reproduction in the gut and differentiates through several stages ultimately resulting in the generation of sporozoites in the tick salivary gland, following meiosis . clinically, ecf is characterized by fever, generalized disease of the lymph nodes and a reduction in the number of white blood cells. susceptible bos taurus animals usually die within three to four weeks as a result of widespread lympho-cytolysis in the lymphoid tissues and pulmonary oedema associated with invasion of the lung lymph node tissue by parasitized lymphocytes  <cit> .

a method of immunization has been established to control development of clinical ecf in cattle, based on inoculation with a preparation of live theileria sporozoites extracted from ground-up, infected whole ticks  <cit> . a potentially fatal dose of sporozoites is inoculated subcutaneously to initiate an infection, which is then controlled by concomitant injection of a long-acting formulation of oxytetracycline. this approach is known as “infection and treatment method” or itm . long-lasting, heterologous protection is obtained with this immunization method using the “muguga cocktail”, a formulation containing three stocks of t. parva – muguga, kiambu <dig>  and serengeti-transformed  <cit> . in the absence of further challenge, the ecf immunity induced by itm vaccination lasts for at least 43 months  <cit> , but since febrile reactions to challenge increase with time since last exposure it is believed that, with regular natural exposure to the parasite, this immunity may be maintained over a longer period of time  <cit> .

deployment of this vaccine has occurred primarily in the tanzanian maasai pastoralist sector, with approximately one million calves vaccinated to date, but it has also been used on a smaller scale in pilot projects in the dairy sector in uganda and elsewhere in east africa. the success of vaccination in tanzania has stimulated regional demand for itm including in southern sudan and kenya  <cit> . one of the major drawbacks of itm is that, if carried out incorrectly, the immunization procedure can lead to severe ecf-like symptoms. this problem has recently been considerably reduced by using higher doses of oxytetracycline  <cit> .

challenges associated with scaling up delivery of itm are the use of live parasites, requiring a secured liquid nitrogen supply and an uninterrupted cold chain for delivery to the farmer, and the high production cost of the three independent stocks that are combined to produce the t. parva muguga cocktail. a further issue is that production of each new vaccine batch requires infection of cattle followed by application of ticks, during which genetic recombination may occur, and finally the combination of material from ground ticks, each carrying a variable amount of one of the three vaccine stocks  <cit> . therefore, the composition of each batch of immunizing stabilate is likely to differ, leading to a requirement for molecular characterization of component stocks, as part of quality control. lastly, as perhaps most significant of all, is the fact that upon itm vaccination cattle do not clear the parasite, but instead become carriers with low-level parasitemia. therefore, when muguga cocktail-based itm vaccination is first introduced into new geographic regions, the risk of it failing to induce cross-protection against the locally circulating t. parva population, and the introduction of novel t. parva genotypes from the vaccine preparation into these parasite populations  <cit> , necessitates close monitoring of vaccinated cattle. the remarkable success of itm in field settings, together with the challenges highlighted above, have led to a renewed interest in identifying the molecular basis of this vaccine’s broad efficacy. in addition to improving itm, this knowledge could also be applied to leverage development of an efficacious subunit vaccine that avoids the drawbacks of live immunization.

the advent of next generation sequencing has made determination of complete genome sequences of t. parva cost-effective  <cit> . in this study, we have sequenced the genome of the t. parva muguga cocktail vaccine component stocks kiambu <dig> and serengeti-transformed. we have also re-sequenced a clonal parasite, muguga clone  <dig> , derived from the t. parva muguga stock, which represents the third component of the muguga cocktail  <cit> . comparison of these genomes aims to provide insight into antigen gene variant combinations that render this vaccine cocktail particularly effective in the field, as well as providing baseline data on the component stocks. additionally, the data generated can be used to develop single nucleotide polymorphism panels for high resolution monitoring of vaccine composition and of breakthrough infections.

RESULTS
whole genome sequencing data
the three isolates included in this study were sequenced on two different sequencing platforms, resulting in data with different read lengths and depth of coverage . for serengeti-transformed and muguga <dig>  that were sequenced using  <dig> technology,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the reads obtained aligned to the reference t. parva muguga genome, respectively. for serengeti-transformed, the mean read length was 541 bp, and the median was 549 bp, and for muguga <dig>  the mean was 470 bp and median was 480 bp. the total number of mapped bases corresponds to a theoretical sequence coverage of 58x for serengeti-transformed and 29x for muguga <dig> 

the whole genome sequence data for the kiambu <dig> stock was generated using ion torrent technology. eighty three percent of all sequencing wells were used. quality control resulted in the elimination of 30 % of reads, which were either primer dimers, or of low quality as determined by standard ion torrent filters. a total of >  <dig>  million reads passed quality control checks, and these exhibited a mean length of 225 bp, and a median length of 209 bp. of these, 94 % mapped to the reference t. parva muguga sequence, resulting in theoretical sequence coverage of 39x for the kiambu <dig> genome.

dna sequence polymorphism and genetic relationship among the components of the t. parva muguga cocktail
the level of genome sequence similarity between these three t. parva stocks included in the muguga cocktail, namely muguga, serengeti-transformed, and kiambu <dig>  is high but variable, as determined by snp densities that vary between  <dig>  snps/kb for serengeti-transformed to  <dig>  snps/kb for kiambu <dig> relative to muguga . these snp densities are likely an underestimation, since snps can only be identified in the regions of the reference genome to which sequence reads from the query isolate map. in fact, there was incomplete genome coverage from all isolates, with  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % of the muguga genome lacking read coverage from muguga <dig>  serengeti-transformed and kiambu <dig>  respectively .table  <dig> number of snps identified between each t. parva stock in the muguga cocktail and the reference muguga strain

sequencing of muguga <dig>  a second clone derived from the muguga stock, that is different from the clone used to generate the t. parva reference genome, is included primarily as a reference for internal variation within the stock. the results confirm that muguga <dig> is nearly identical to the reference genome, with only  <dig> variants identified across the whole genome . the kiambu <dig> isolate is the most distinct of the three, with  <dig>  snps relative to the t. parva muguga reference. the majority of sequence variants between the kiambu <dig> and the reference muguga isolate, a subset of  <dig>  snps, are shared with the kiambuz <dig> clone that was sequenced previously by hayashida and collaborators  <cit> . unexpectedly, serengeti-transformed appears to be remarkably similar to the muguga reference, with only  <dig> sequence variants identified between the two isolates,  <dig> of which are shared with muguga <dig> . the snps found in each isolate were classified into synonymous, non-synonymous, intronic or intergenic based on the updated annotation of the reference genome assembly of the t. parva muguga isolate .

despite the fact that these stocks were not cloned prior to cattle infection, no biallelic snps were detected in serengeti-transformed, and only  <dig> of the  <dig>  snps were scored as biallelic in kiambu <dig>  well within the error rate of ion torrent sequencing technology  <cit> . this result suggests that, in both isolates, only a single clone was detectable at the piroplasma stage of infection.

we used the isolates sequenced in this study, as well as other cattle and buffalo strains previously sequenced by hayashida et al.  <cit> , to determine the relationship among the three constituents of the muguga cocktail in the context of the genomic information available for t. parva . our analysis shows the kiambu <dig> stock clusters with the previously sequenced kiambu clone, kiambuz <dig>  as would be expected. however, the serengeti-transformed stock did not cluster with other buffalo-derived strains, and instead appears to be extremely similar to the muguga reference strain. this indicates that the serengeti-transformed stock currently used in the muguga cocktail vaccine most likely is not the original buffalo-derived stock.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationships of twelve t. parva isolates. genomic distances are measured in snps detected within the coding region of  <dig> randomly selected genes. support was obtained from  <dig> bootstrap replicates. represented isolates include t. parva stocks analyzed in this study, and the additional stocks described by hayashida et al. in  <cit> , namely the cattle-derived t. parva parasite stocks "entebbe", "katumba", "nyakizu", "chitongoz2", "kateteb2", "kiambuz464", and "mandaliz22", as well as the african cape buffalo-derived stocks "lawrencei", and "z5e5". stocks are labeled according to country of origin: northern end of the distribution -kenya, uganda and rwanda ; north-central region –tanzania ; central region –zambia . the three vaccine isolates are shown 



whole genome differences between serengeti-transformed and muguga
the high similarity between these two isolates allows the detailed scrutiny of the mutations most likely to be of phenotypic relevance. sequence reads from the serengeti-transformed isolate mapped with 100 % coverage to  <dig> of  <dig> protein-coding genes in the reference t. parva muguga isolate, a reflection of the negligible nucleotide sequence divergence between the two isolates. of the  <dig> genes with incomplete read coverage, ten have less than 90 % sequence coverage. all these  <dig> genes are members of multigene families, including tpr , sub-telomeric variable secreted protein -like and sfii-like genes, and the lack of read mapping is likely the result of mapping ambiguity. of the  <dig> variants between serengeti-transformed and muguga,  <dig> are synonymous,  <dig> are non-synonymous, and one is a nonsense mutation. from this set of variants,  <dig> are shared between the serengeti-transformed and muguga <dig> stocks, including the nonsense mutation. this nonsense mutation is in the 4th amino acid in the protein encoded by tpmuguga_03g <dig> , a locus that is part of the hyper-variable tpr region, in chromosome  <dig> of t. parva muguga. the tpr locus consists of a series of tandemly arrayed, rapidly evolving genes  and in t. parva muguga has five predicted transmembrane domains, suggesting that the protein encoded is membrane-associated. the presence of the nonsense mutation implies that not all proteins encoded in the tpr locus are functional in all strains of t. parva. alternatively, one of several downstream in-frame methionine-encoding codons might function as the true start codon.

in total,  <dig> protein-coding sequences  have changes relative to muguga, with  <dig> having non-synonymous variants . these cdss are clustered in a few specific genomic locations, in particular close to the telomeres . a total of  <dig> genes encode proteins with well-characterized function,  <dig> of which contain non-synonymous snps .fig.  <dig> distribution of variants in the serengeti-transformed and kiambu <dig> isolates relative to the genome of the t. parva muguga reference isolate. for each of the four t. parva muguga chromosomes the location of the protein coding genes in shown , with genes encoded in the forward and reverse strands in the top and bottom central tracks, respectively. genes with non-synonymous differences between serengeti and muguga are shown in red. known antigens are shown in green. variants were estimated in 2kb-long, non-overlapping windows; for each of the isolates, the proportion of the window with read coverage  is displayed, as is the number of snps per window

fthis genes coding sequence had at least one position with <10x mapping coverage in the kiambu <dig> stock, and thus there is likely more variation in the actual sequence



notably, seven of these genes with non-synonymous snps encode abc-transporters, including the previously characterized tpabc <dig>   <cit> , with the remaining six comprising three translation initiation factor if- <dig> genes, an f-box-like/wd repeat-containing protein tbl1xr <dig>  a dna replication factor cdt1-like, and a papain family cysteine protease. the  <dig> variant genes were evaluated for the presence of trans-membrane and gpi-anchored motifs and for predicted product localization. while no gpi-anchored peptides were identified, all the eight abc-transporters had 11- <dig> trans-membrane domains, while the three translation initiation factor if- <dig> genes and the papain family cysteine protease all have a single putative trans-membrane domain.

the abc transporter gene family is characteristically located in the genomic region that separates sub-telomeric repeats families from the core of the chromosomes where most single copy genes are located  <cit> . the polymorphic tpabc <dig> locus and its homologs were evaluated further to determine the location of the variant residues. the trans-membrane regions showed non-synonymous snp densities from  <dig>  –  <dig>  %, while non-synonymous snp densities for intra- and extra-cellular regions were generally  <dig> - <dig>  %, and  <dig> - <dig>  % respectively. notably though, tpmuguga_04_ <dig> had a non-synonymous snp density of  <dig>  % in its predicted intracellular regions.

papain cysteine proteases are of particular interest in apicomplexan vaccinology. in t. parva they are thought to facilitate lymphocyte invasion  <cit> . papain family cysteine proteases have been considered as potential vaccine targets in the related apicomplexan plasmodium falciparum  <cit> , and the previously described t. parva antigen tp <dig>  in chromosome  <dig> , is a papain family cysteine protease. the polymorphic papain cysteine protease identified here  is located in chromosome  <dig>  and its antigenic potential warrants further investigation.

finally, the translation initiation and replication factors, as well as the f-box-like protein, are all involved in transcription regulation. their presence among this small set of highly variable proteins is unexpected but not entirely surprising, since one of the previously identified antigens, tp <dig>  is a eukaryotic initiation factor eif-1a.

parasite multigene families, often encoded in subtelomeric regions, play a fundamental role in pathogenesis of eukaryotic parasites, most notably in evasion of the host immune system, and as such they tend to be quite variable . in t. annulata, the tash1/suat <dig> family proteins have a potential role in host cell transformation and possibly in host cell immortalization  <cit>  and there are homologues of these genes in t. parva that have not yet been tested functionally. the svsp family is a subtelomeric gene family with a highly complex expression pattern  <cit> . therefore, it is not surprising that many of the  <dig> genes with nucleotide differences between muguga and serengeti-transformed, which do not encode a well-characterized protein, belong to multigene families . of these,  <dig> are members of the hyper variable tpr  region. all these genes have between  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane regions, and some contain putative domains. in addition, nine genes show high similarity  to the theileria annulata sfii family. the sfii family is a sub-telomeric gene family characterized by the presence of an sfii restriction site. twelve of the  <dig> uncharacterized proteins have strong sequence similarity to the t. parva sub-telomeric variable secreted protein  family, including two full length proteins as well as ten with similarity only over a terminal end of the protein, including four of the sfii family proteins mentioned above, as well with six other hypothetical proteins. finally, one gene had a predicted zinc finger and btb domain-containing at the amino terminus, one was very similar to a t. annulata cysteine repeat modular protein  <dig>  one to the t. annulata tash <dig> gene, one to babesia bigemina vam6/vps39-like gene, and finally eight genes had no non-hypothetical blastx hits, although some contained conserved domains.

whole genome sequence diversity between kiambu <dig> and muguga
a total of  <dig>  variants were identified between kiambu <dig> and the reference t. parva muguga isolate, affecting the coding region of  <dig>  cdss. of these variants,  <dig>  are non-synonymous mutations, which fall in  <dig>  protein-coding genes . two patterns are markedly different from what was determined in the serengeti-transformed vs. muguga comparison. first, instead of primarily restricted to subtelomeric regions, the non-synonymous mutations are distributed throughout the genome . secondly, for a large number of genes in the t. parva muguga reference genome, coverage with reads sequenced from the kiambu <dig> genome is either partial  or absent , a result of the considerable sequence divergence observed between the two isolates.

among all sequence variants found,  <dig> snps are exclusively shared with serengeti-transformed,  <dig> with both serengeti-transformed and muguga <dig>  and no snps are shared between kiambu <dig> and muguga <dig> to the exclusion of serengeti-transformed . of the  <dig> snps shared between kiambu <dig> and serengeti-transformed, five are intergenic, four are located in tpmuguga_04g <dig>  two in tpmuguga_01g <dig>  and one each in tpmuguga_02g <dig> and tpmuguga_02g <dig>  all these genes encode hypothetical proteins. using blastx against the ncbi non-redundant gene database reveals a conserved cdt1_m superfamily domain in tpmuguga_04g <dig>  and a translation factor ii like superfamily domain in tpmuguga_02g <dig> 

of the  <dig> cdss that differed between serengeti-transformed and the muguga reference,  <dig> also have detectable differences in kiambu <dig> . of these, three cdss have more than  <dig> non-synonymous changes relative to muguga, namely two of the abc transporters  and one hypothetical protein with sequence similarity to the sfii family . when compared to the muguga reference, the latter has only a single non-synonymous snp in the serengeti-transformed stock but  <dig> non-synonymous polymorphisms in kiambu <dig>  while the two abc transporters are among the  <dig> genes with a large number of non-synonymous snps between serengeti-transformed and the muguga reference genome. the accurate number of snps in many of these  <dig> genes could not be estimated from read mapping between muguga and kiambu <dig> due to incomplete read coverage over the length of each gene. the incomplete read coverage suggests that there are additional differences between the two isolates, and at sufficient density, to preclude kiambu <dig> reads to map to the sequence of their muguga homologs , although other explanations exist . therefore, these are in fact highly polymorphic genes.

nucleotide sequence variation in known t. parva antigens
to date, fourteen t. parva genes have been identified as antigens recognized by antibodies or t cells . these antigens have in some cases been demonstrated experimentally to induce an immune response in the cattle host, but no single antigen, or evaluated combination of antigens, confers immunity to both t. parva experimental sporozoite needle infection and tick field challenge after delivery as recombinant subunit vaccines  <cit> . it is, however, possible that one or more of these antigens contribute to protective immunity when presented in the context of challenge with the live parasite.table  <dig> list of known t. parva antigens described in literature. no variants were found for serengeti-transformed in any of these loci, so only kiambu <dig> nucleotide sequence variants are reported



interestingly, serengeti-transformed is identical to the muguga reference genome in all of the currently described antigens. kiambu <dig> shows a number of variations within this set of genes, with  <dig> synonymous and  <dig> non-synonymous snps detected. in total, six of the known antigens have non-synonymous changes, namely the cd <dig> t cell target schizont antigen tp <dig>  tp <dig>  tp <dig>  and also gp <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  in addition, three proteins, namely the p <dig>  tp <dig>  and pim antigens all had segments with no coverage, which precluded reliable snp identification in these regions, and suggested substantial differences between the two isolates. finally, no kiambu <dig> reads mapped to the muguga tp <dig> locus, a highly variable antigen, suggesting the presence of widespread nucleotide differences over the entirety of the locus between these two isolates. the sequence of pim is known for kiambu <dig>  and very different to that of serengeti-transformed and muguga, which are identical  <cit> .

most of the genes have no trans-membrane motifs and none has more than four, which indicates that none of these are likely to be membrane constituents. tp <dig>  tp <dig> and p <dig> all contain gpi-anchoring motifs. most of these are targeted to the secretory pathway with high reliability, confirming the widespread assumption that secreted proteins are likely to be targeted by the host immune system during the schizont stage. only half of these genes contain non-synonymous polymorphism, a frequency that is not significantly different from that found for the whole genome  and suggests that a high level of polymorphism is not a necessary property of antigens. however, some of these antigens are indeed extraordinarily polymorphic, such as p <dig>  p <dig> and gp <dig> with respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> non-synonymous polymorphisms relative to muguga, and the tp <dig> antigen apparently so distinct that no reads map across isolates within the default read mapping stringency of bwa. this conclusion is supported by the fact that this gene is highly polymorphic, with average pairwise difference between alleles well above 10 % .

identification of additional putative antigens
the interaction between antigens and the host immune system can lead to positive selection, either due to the increased fitness of non-synonymous polymorphisms or due to frequency-dependent selection, leading to an increase in πn and in πn/πs within genes encoding antigens relative to other genes. hence, signatures of positive selection are often used to identify potential antigens . accordingly, we searched for genes potentially evolving under positive selection using the comparison between the muguga reference and kiambu <dig> alleles according to three different criteria: i) high πn, a measure of the proportion of non-synonymous sites that differ between the alleles,  high πn/πs, a measure of the rate of amino-acid changing mutations relative to the rate of silent mutations, and  a less well-defined criterion, namely muguga single copy gene for which a high proportion of the length has no coverage from kiambu <dig> reads, suggesting that the level of sequence divergence between the two isolates is quite high, with a resulting snp density that prevented successful read alignment. in the comparison between the muguga reference and kiambu <dig>  πn varied between  <dig> –  <dig>  %, with a modal value of  <dig>  % . the genes with the highest 5 % πn values, and that encode a non-hypothetical protein, are listed in table  <dig>  the values of πn/πs ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> , for genes with a valid πn/πs ratio, and the distribution has a modal value of  <dig>  .fig.  <dig> distribution of πn and πn/πs for all genes in a comparison between two strains of t. parva. histograms of histograms of  the distribution of non-synonymous polymorphism  and  the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous polymorphism in a comparison between the sequence of kiambu <dig> and the reference muguga isolate. show are the mean, as well as the mean + 3*sd which is the cut-off used for additional file 5: table s5

dsnps between kiambu <dig> and the reference muguga isolate



the lack of read mapping across specific regions of isolate genomes is almost certainly a reflection of low sequence similarity, and hence an indicator of rapid evolution rates . a total of  <dig> muguga genes  completely lacked read coverage in kiambu <dig>  and  <dig> genes  had less than 10x mean coverage, preventing variant calling. of these  <dig> ,  <dig> are single copy genes. we identified the  <dig> genes with the lowest read mapping percentage . these include  <dig> novel genes, which were absent from the original annotation of the muguga genome, and which are now part of the annotation being released in  <dig> . in total, these  <dig> include  <dig> hypothetical proteins,  <dig> genes lacking annotation, three contain conserved duf <dig> domains of unknown function, three dna-directed rna polymerase subunit beta, and one of each ribose 5-phosphate isomerase a , tbc domain-containing protein kinase-like protein, dna-directed rna polymerase subunit gamma, elongation factor tu gtp binding domain, and h/aca ribonucleoprotein complex subunit  <dig>  five of these  <dig> genes also had modifications between serengeti-transformed and muguga, all hypothetical proteins . one of these  has paralogs in the genome, the remaining four being tpmuguga_01g <dig>  tpmuguga_01g <dig>  tpmuguga_02g <dig>  and tpmuguga_02g <dig>  which are all close to the telomeric region of their respective chromosomes.

finally, we compiled a group of genes with a πn or πn/πs value greater than three standard deviations above the mean value of each statistic, comparable to the selection criteria used by hayashida  <cit> , and supplemented with the genes selected in this study according to any of the criteria listed above that were also detected by the hayashida study . the two studies obtained slightly different distributions for πn/πs values, which averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig> sd in the present study, compared to the study of hayashida and colleagues  <cit>  with average of  <dig>  ±  <dig> sd; the difference is not surprising given that both studies are based on a small number of parasite stocks, which differ between the studies, and on different methodologies, both in terms of read length, as well as stringency of read mapping and snp calling. interestingly, despite the use of different isolates and different selection criteria, of the  <dig> genes prioritized by hayashida and collaborators, and the  <dig> prioritized in this study,  <dig> genes are present in both sets. the  <dig> genes identified in both studies include many of the known antigens, and is likely to represent a subset of particular interest in terms of antigenic potential .

discussion
the importance of the serengeti-transformed and kiambu <dig> isolates
the muguga cocktail vaccine is composed of three different isolates, each of which is thought to contribute to the efficacy of itm. with the goal of identifying unique features that might be provided by each strain we sequenced and analyzed the components of this vaccine cocktail. a striking result from this study is the remarkable similarity between the serengeti-transformed genome and that of the muguga reference strain. when compared to muguga, serengeti-transformed shows only roughly  <dig>  times the number of snps found in the muguga <dig> clone, which is a variant derived from the muguga stock. this represents  <dig> times fewer snps than were identified between kiambu <dig> and muguga, and almost  <dig> times less than the previously published marikebuni and uganda stocks, when compared to t. parva muguga  <cit> . the serengeti-transformed stock was originally a component of a buffalo isolate that was experimentally adapted to cattle through tick passage  <cit> . given the high level of sequence divergence observed between t. parva isolates from cattle and the few available buffalo-derived isolates  <cit> , it is very surprising that the original serengeti-transformed stock would be so similar to the cattle-derived muguga stock. three possible scenarios can explain this observation. it is conceivable that the serengeti-transformed stock is indeed a buffalo isolate which is nevertheless unusually closely related to the muguga reference isolate, making the  <dig> annotated cds with non-synonymous snps between the serengeti-transformed and muguga stocks extremely interesting from the point of view of their potential to confer protective efficacy. also conceivable is the possibility that the serengeti-transformed stock was a mixed stock containing both more “typical” buffalo-derived strains as well as a strain similar to cattle-derived isolates and very similar to muguga, with the latter being preferentially selected during recurrent passage. finally, the currently used serengeti-transformed stock that is contained within the muguga cocktail represents a historical contamination with a t. parva muguga clone. the fact that the serengeti-transformed strain analyzed here shares  <dig> snps with muguga <dig>  indicates that the two are likely to share a very recent common ancestor, and favors this last scenario.

regardless of its relationship with muguga stock, the serengeti-transformed strain analyzed here is in fact the component currently used under that name in the muguga cocktail. this vaccine formulation is effective in the field, but our observations raise the question of whether the inclusion of this serengeti-transformed strain is necessary for the muguga cocktail to be protective, or if instead the preparation of the muguga cocktail could be streamlined by eliminating this strain. in fact, the need to re-investigate the contribution of the serengeti-transformed strain to the muguga cocktail was first discussed as early as  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, however, despite the surprisingly high sequence similarity between muguga and serengeti-transformed, there are several proteins that differ considerably between those two stocks. these highly variably loci include members of the tpr repeat family, abc-transporters, a papain-family cysteine protease, and proteins which show sequence similarity to the svsp and sfii families, predicted to be involved in parasite host interaction. sub-telomeric gene families are often involved in host-pathogen interactions, making these genes of particular interest.

finally, whether or not the re-introduction of a more divergent, buffalo-derived t. parva stock could improve further the protective performance of the muguga cocktail under different field conditions will require further studies. one possible constraint is the difficulty to propagate buffalo-derived strains in ticks and cattle to generate sufficient quantities for stabilate production.

incomplete coverage with mapped reads can result from several factors including  heterogeneity in cloning and/or sequencing efficiency of different genomic regions ,  the fact that whole genome shotgun sequencing coverage follows a poisson distribution, with some regions, by chance, being sequenced at much lower level that others, and resulting in some regions with no coverage at all in most genomes sequenced to a reasonable depth of coverage,  ambiguity in mapping location  or  high degree of sequence divergence between sequence reads and the target genome. the difference in coverage between muguga <dig> and serengeti-transformed likely results from the difference in data volume  coupled with the random distribution of reads described in  above. the fact that many of the genes with incomplete or no read coverage in the comparison between muguga and kiambu <dig> are known to be of average gc content and high polymorphism suggest that, for the most part, factor  above is the main reason for the incomplete read coverage observed for kiambu <dig>  the comparison between muguga and kiambu <dig> clearly highlights the limitations of read mapping-based characterization of gene evolution rates. in particular, the precise quantification of genetic differences between divergent isolates is restricted to genes with low polymorphism. reliable estimates of sequence polymorphism for rapidly evolving genes, and in-depth characterization of the selective pressures governing their evolution, will require de novo genome assemblies from which complete gene sequences can be extracted and analyzed.

implications of the sequence data for itm vaccine quality control
previous studies of the genetic composition of stocks and stabilates comprising the muguga cocktail utilized southern blotting with multicopy probes  <cit> , nucleotide sequencing and a panel of mini- and micro-satellite markers  <cit> . application of these approaches  <cit>  also revealed close similarity between muguga and serengeti-transformed including the sequence of the gene encoding the polymorphic immunodominant molecule . these two studies  <cit>  additionally revealed diversity within dna prepared directly from the sporozoite stabilates. a more recent study using only five satellite markers  <cit> , revealed even more heterogeneity within the dna of muguga and serengeti-transformed stabilates, while kiambu <dig> appeared to be clonal with these markers. the stocks that were used for infection of animals were not cloned, and these stabilate genotyping studies do, in fact, suggest that multiple clones could have been present in the initial sporozoite inoculum  <cit> . however, our analyses reveal the presence of a single genotype in both the serengeti-transformed and kiambu <dig> dna samples. taken together these observations suggest that, upon infection, only one of possibly multiple clones present will expand to become the predominant and only detectable parasite in the infection. the phenomenon of selective amplification of a predominant clonotype on passage through cattle and ticks has been observed previously. for example, when the marikebuni stock was used to infect cattle,  <dig> clonal genotypes were reduced to  <dig> in a single passage, and 75 % of these were derived from one highly inbred genotype  <cit> . the study by patel and collaborators  <cit>  did not reveal the very extensive genetic divergence between serengeti-transformed/muguga and kiambu <dig>  perhaps because of the markers used, which were selected from a pool of  <dig> vntr  markers that were strongly biased towards those that detect diversity within the t. parva muguga stock. the higher information content and value of snp-based, genome-wide genotyping is clearly illustrated by the discrimination of muguga and serengeti-transformed at specific loci, particularly in the atp binding cassette transporter family, despite their overall similarity.

the sub-telomeric svsp gene family members are predicted to be part of the schizont secretome of t. annulata and t. parva that has expanded selectively when compared to the non-transforming t. orientalis genome  <cit> . sequences of svsp gene family members differ between all isolates compared here, giving each isolate a unique svsp genomic signature. investigation of cellular immune responses in itm-vaccinated cattle using peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated by sets of overlapping synthetic peptides covering these variant svsp is well justified based on the data presented in this study.

the close dependency on the muguga reference genome poses significant challenges to the identification of novel features in each of the components of the muguga cocktail. as discussed above in terms of read mapping, genetic differences between the isolates can only be identified if they are sparsely distributed and located close to conserved regions that can anchor the mapped reads. in addition, the only genes analyzed were those present in the reference muguga isolate, and so there are currently no features known to be unique to the kiambu <dig> or serengeti-transformed genomes, such as the presence of previously unknown genes or genomic rearrangements. while the iontorrent  <dig> sequencing chip produced good quality data, it did not allow the generation of a high quality de novo genome assembly. further sequencing using paired-end or long-read data will be needed to identify genomic rearrangements, sequences that are unique to specific stocks, and perform analyses of the full complement of rapidly evolving genes.

relevance to development of other whole-organism vaccines
recently, there has been renewed enthusiasm for the prospect of the development of a effective whole live plasmodium falciparum sporozoite vaccine, based on the encouraging outcome of a number of phase i clinical trials  <cit> . the possibility of manufacturing cryopreserved, metabolically active, live p. falciparum sporozoites  suitable for clinical application has been a milestone for this vaccine development approach  <cit> . the t. parva muguga cocktail is composed of three isolates, two of which are nearly identical, and which together represent most likely only a small amount of the genetic variation circulating in the field . the fact that this preparation is able to confer high levels of protection against highly diverse t. parva cattle-transmissible field isolates, and that population variation in p. falciparum is much lower than that is observed in t. parva  <cit> , is highly supportive of a similar initiative in malaria.

CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced the whole genomes of three t. parva component stocks  that form the basis of the itm procedure for control of east coast fever in cattle in east africa. the serengeti-transformed isolate currently used in this cocktail, even though originally isolated from the main wildlife host, african cape buffalo , is very similar to the cattle-derived stock from which the t. parva muguga reference isolate was cloned. all non-synonymous snps were found in only  <dig> genes, mostly sub-telomeric loci and/or genes predicted to encode antigenic proteins. the kiambu <dig> stock is much more divergent, containing approximately  <dig>  single nucleotide differences relative to muguga, including > <dig>  amino acid-changing mutations that affect  <dig>  % of the predicted proteins. importantly, the genetic content and variation of kiambu <dig>  muguga and serengeti-transformed represent only a small proportion of the genetic variation of cattle-derived t. parva isolates circulating in the field. our results demonstrate that whole organism-based, live vaccines against highly polymorphic apicomplexan parasites can be highly effective. the muguga cocktail does not, however, cross-protect against all buffalo-derived t. parva in eastern africa  <cit> . genome-wide studies that focus on genetic differences between cattle- and buffalo-derived t. parva parasites will shed light on the genomic basis of vaccine evasion by the latter, and inform the design of more broadly protective vaccine preparations.
