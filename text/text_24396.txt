BACKGROUND
although cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, few therapeutic advances appear to be of value in the clinic  <cit> . we have observed an inherent tendency of the vasculature to undergo phenotypic changes as a response to cerebral ischemia  <cit> . therefore, the cerebral vessels show transcriptional upregulation of the vasoconstrictive g-protein coupled receptors  5-hydroxytryptamine type 1b , angiotensin ii type  <dig>  and endothelin type b  after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage  or after focal ischemic stroke  <cit> . identical receptor upregulation has been observed in patients that died of stroke  <cit> . in both types of experimental stroke, the receptor upregulation is mediated via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway mek/erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . a similar type of receptor upregulation can be achieved experimentally by incubating isolated arteries in serum-free culture medium at 37°c for  <dig> to  <dig> h  <cit> .

the first signaling molecule in the mek/erk1/ <dig> pathway, raf, is a serine/threonine kinase existing in three different isoforms  with a common activator, ras, and a single known common substrate, mek. even though mek is the common substrate, experiments on raf knock-out mice show isoform-specific functions for a-, b-, and c-raf  <cit> . b-raf is the only isoform that is strongly activated by ras alone  <cit>  and the most active isoform when it comes to phosphorylating mek in vitro  <cit> . we therefore designed this study to examine the role of the b-raf isoform in inducing the observed gpcr alterations seen after cerebral ischemia. two previously characterized b-raf selective inhibitors were used in this study, sb- <dig>  <cit>  and sb- <dig>  <cit> . the inhibitors are both small atp competitive inhibitors with high selectivity for b-raf when tested against a panel of related protein kinases, but are different in that sb- <dig> has a higher affinity for b-raf. we show that culturing human cerebral arteries in the presence of b-raf inhibitors strongly attenuates 5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb receptor-mediated contractions compared with arteries cultured with vehicle alone. the receptor proteins were evaluated with immunofluorescence and a marked reduction in at <dig> receptor immunofluorescence was observed after treatment with sb- <dig>  additionally, the observed increase in phosphorylated b-raf  immunoreactivity after incubation was diminished after treatment with the b-raf inhibitors.

RESULTS
in vitro pharmacology
initially, the vessel segments were normalized and stretched to 90% of the internal circumference that a fully relaxed vessel under a transmural pressure of  <dig> mm hg would have. the mean normalized internal circumference and standard deviation was  <dig> ±  <dig> μm. k+-induced contractions did not differ significantly among the three groups; vehicle, sb- <dig>  and sb- <dig> data confirmed that all groups responded similarly to k+, excluding the possibility that the b-raf inhibitors had an effect on the viability of the vessels. emax and pec <dig> values for each group are presented in table  <dig> 

responses were characterized by emax values, expressed as percent of  <dig>  mm k+-induced contraction, and pec <dig> values. values are represented as mean ± s.e.m., with n representing the number of patients. statistical analyses were performed using the non-parametric kruskal-wallis test and dunn´s multiple comparison test. *p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  compared with vehicle. 5-ct - 5-carboxamidotryptamine, ang ii - angiotensin ii, et- <dig> - endothelin- <dig> 

contractile responses to 5-carboxamidotryptamine
5-ht1b receptor-mediated contraction was studied using cumulative application of 5-carboxamidotryptamine . vessel segments treated with sb- <dig> or sb- <dig> both showed attenuated contractile responses to 5-ct and gave rise to reduced emax values compared with vehicle-treated vessels . the inhibitory effect was significant for vessels treated with sb- <dig>  emax  <dig>  ±  <dig> % compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the vehicle group .

contractile responses to angiotensin ii
application of angiotensin ii  induced a concentration-dependent contractile response at lower concentrations  and dilatation at higher concentrations . the maximum contraction was attenuated after treatment with sb- <dig>  and sb- <dig>  compared with  <dig>  ±  <dig> % for the control vessels treated with vehicle .

contractile responses to endothelin-1
endothelin- <dig>  gave rise to a biphasic concentration-dependent response indicating the presence of both eta  and etb  receptors in a manner previously characterized in detail  <cit> . the high-affinity phase corresponding to etb receptor-mediated contraction was significantly decreased in the presence of sb- <dig>  while sb- <dig> did not have a significant effect  compared with vehicle  <dig>  ±  <dig> % . eta receptor-mediated contractions  were not significantly altered by the application of either inhibitor .

immunohistochemistry
hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed on all specimens. no morphological differences were observed in the smooth muscle cell layers except for two compressed areas from the wires in the in vitro pharmacology experiments . therefore, these areas were not used for any kind of evaluation or analysis in the immunohistochemical experiments.

expression of g-protein coupled receptors
protein expression of individual receptors was evaluated with immunofluorescence using antibodies against the 5-ht1b, at <dig> , at <dig>  eta , and etb receptors. in addition, double immunostaining was performed with 5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb receptors together with actin  to determine the localization of the receptors. double staining revealed that all three receptors were found in the smooth muscle cell layer .

fluorescence intensity measurements were performed on all receptor stainings. because of inter-individual differences and differences in pre-treatment and in vessel size, we did not see a close correlation between immunostaining and the in vitro experiments. however, a marked increase in at <dig> receptor immunofluorescence was observed in organ cultured vessels treated with vehicle compared with fresh, non-cultured vessels. the immunofluorescence was reduced in vessels treated with sb- <dig>  and to a smaller extent after treatment with sb- <dig> , compared with vehicle. no significant differences in 5-ht1b, at <dig>  etb, and eta  receptor immunoreactivity were detected.

expression of phosphorylated b-raf
the protein expression of activated p-b-raf was evaluated with immunofluorescence. as in the receptor immunofluorescence experiments, inter-individual and segmental differences were observed. nevertheless, an increase in p-b-raf immunoreactivity was observed in cultured brain vessels compared with fresh non-cultured vessels. in addition, immunofluorescence intensity was clearly reduced in vessels treated with sb- <dig> or sb- <dig> .

discussion
the present study demonstrates for the first time that upregulation of the contractile receptors 5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb in human cerebral arteries is mediated by b-raf signaling. these receptor subtypes have been characterized in human cerebral arteries in detail in previous studies  <cit> . in human ischemic stroke, we have observed enhanced levels of protein and mrna of 5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb receptors in middle cerebral artery smooth muscle cells  <cit> . presently, the co-incubation of cerebral arteries with two different b-raf antagonists prevents organ culture-induced upregulation of contractile responses to 5-ct, ang ii, and et- <dig>  the effect on receptor-mediated contraction was more prominent after treatment with sb- <dig>  which is to be expected because it has a lower kd value, and therefore a higher affinity for its ligand, than sb- <dig>  <cit> .

in vitro pharmacology
the maximum contraction elicited by 5-ct was significantly reduced, as demonstrated by the reduction in emax after co-incubation with sb- <dig> . the receptor responsible for this contraction has been demonstrated to be the 5-ht1b receptor subtype, which is also selectively expressed in human cerebral arteries, as demonstrated by protein 5-ht1b expression and inhibition by a selective 5-ht1b antagonist  <cit> . the role of 5-ht and its receptors in ischemia are not clear; while some studies report a protective role for 5-ht receptor agonists  <cit> , others show increased contractility and improvement with 5-ht receptor antagonists  <cit> . guilbert et al. show that 5-ht1b is responsible for the 5-ht aggravation seen in exercise-induced cardiac ischemia in dogs  <cit> . additionally, 5-ht1b receptors have been suggested to interact with 20-hydroxyeiscosatetraenoic acid  and thereby contribute to the acute fall in regional cerebral blood flow after sah  <cit> . we have previously reported on increased 5-ht1b protein expression and receptor-mediated contraction after sah and organ culture in cerebral arteries  <cit> , which could impair the cerebral blood flow and thereby contribute to ischemic damage. the present study demonstrates that the selective b-raf inhibitor sb- <dig> significantly decreases 5-ht1b receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, suggesting that the elevated contractile response of 5-ht1b receptors observed after organ culture is regulated by the b-raf/mek/erk pathway.

organ culture of isolated human arteries in the presence of sb- <dig> or sb- <dig> reduced ang ii-mediated contraction . available data show that cerebral vasoconstriction in response to ang ii is mediated by at <dig> receptors, while vasodilatation is mediated by at <dig> receptors  <cit> . the smooth muscle cell at <dig> receptors are upregulated and show enhanced contractile responses after experimental cerebral ischemia  <cit>  or in human ischemic stroke  <cit> . in support, the reduced vasoconstrictor responses observed in the present study after treatment with the b-raf inhibitor sb- <dig> lead to a concomitant reduction of the at <dig> receptor protein when examined immunohistochemically. the receptor identity has been confirmed using selective antagonists for the at <dig> receptor in human brain vessels  <cit> . blockade of the at <dig> receptor has been shown to improve injury after transient cerebral ischemia  <cit>  and to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in stroke patients  <cit> .

in agreement with a previous study, the selective etb receptor agonist sarafotoxin 6c  did not elicit any vasoconstrictor responses in cultured human cerebral arteries  <cit> . therefore, the high-affinity phase of the et- <dig> biphasic concentration-response curve, corresponding to etb receptor-mediated contraction, was studied. the same situation was seen in the rat middle cerebral artery after experimental sah, detailed pharmacological analysis revealed participation of the etb receptor  <cit> . in the present study, we demonstrate a significant reduction of the etb maximum contraction after co-incubation with sb-590885; sb- <dig> had a weaker effect . no effect on the eta receptor-mediated contraction was observed after treatment with b-raf inhibitors. it is well known that cerebral vessels have contractile eta receptors in the smooth muscle cells and relaxant etb receptors in the endothelium. however, there is a phenotypic change after stroke in both animals and humans, with the appearance of contractile etb receptors in the smooth muscle cells  <cit> . the effect of selective eta blockers on infarct volume after experimental stroke is ambiguous, with studies showing both effect and no effect  <cit> . results have been similar for the combined eta and etb antagonists bosentan and clazosentan. one study using an etb blocker showed an increase in infarct volume  <cit> . the administration of an etb blocker in conjunction with cerebral ischemia causes a blockade of etb receptor-mediated dilation, which exacerbates the initial vasoconstriction and increases the infarct. the etb blocker might be beneficial if it is administered after upregulation of the etb receptor.

et receptor antagonists are not the best approach for improving cerebral perfusion after ischemia because of the opposing effects of a strong contractile eta receptor and a dilatory etb receptor. however, a different approach, whereby the signal transduction of the raf/mek/erk pathway was blocked with the mek1/ <dig> inhibitor u <dig>  diminished the upregulated etb receptor-mediated contraction and reduced stroke volume  <cit> . organ culture of rodent and human cerebral arteries is a way to simulate etb receptor upregulation and to study the molecular mechanisms involved. in the present study, we show that blockade of the mek/erk1/ <dig> pathway using upstream b-raf inhibitors results in attenuated etb receptor-mediated contraction after organ culture.

immunohistochemistry
when examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining, no morphological changes were observed in the vessels except for the regions where the steel wires used in the in vitro pharmacology experiments have been attached . however, it became obvious in the immunohistochemical examination that the vessels showed considerable inter-individual differences, most likely due to differences between the patients themselves. some of the patients exhibited more consistent results than others . these inter-individual differences could explain the inconsistency in the results obtained with the fluorescence intensity measurements.

immunohistochemical staining using the 5-ht1b antibody showed no differences between the groups. in other studies, 5-ht1b expression in rat cerebral arteries is increased after middle cerebral artery occlusion and sah  <cit> .

at <dig> receptor immunoreactivity was reduced after treatment with sb- <dig>  previously, increased at <dig> receptor immunofluorescence after sah in rats has been shown to be reduced after application of sb- <dig>  <cit> . in our study, we observed a decrease in at <dig> receptor immunofluorescence intensity after application of sb- <dig>  but only a small decrease after sb- <dig> , results that are in accordance with the in vitro pharmacology experiments.

eta receptor-mediated contractile responses were not significantly altered by the two b-raf inhibitors used in the present study . immunohistochemical examination disclosed the same pattern; no differences were observed between the groups .

there was an increase in p-b-raf immunoreactivity after organ culture and this effect could be reduced considerably in the presence of sb- <dig> and sb- <dig> . therefore, the activation of b-raf protein kinase could be blocked by the application of specific antagonists. we suggest that b-raf is important for the phenotypic changes of gpcrs observed in the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries after organ culture and cerebral ischemia  <cit> . an interesting question is whether b-raf functions alone or in a heterodimer in this aspect. there is evidence for b-raf/c-raf heterodimerization with highly increased kinase activity compared with the respective homodimers or monomers  <cit> . further studies are needed to elucidate whether heterodimerization is important for the regulation of gpcrs in vascular smooth muscle cells after ischemia and organ culture.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we show that selective inhibition of b-raf using sb- <dig> significantly attenuates 5-ht1b, at <dig>  and etb receptor-mediated contraction in human cerebral arteries. therefore, we suggest that b-raf is important for the altered gpcr expression observed after cerebral ischemia, and that specific blockage might be a novel approach to reduce tissue damage after stroke.
