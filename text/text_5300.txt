BACKGROUND
micrornas , 20– <dig> nucleotides in length, are involved in negative post transcriptional regulation in most multi-cellular organisms . the generality and importance of this recently discovered regulatory mechanism is gradually becoming apparent, and here we present computational evidence for new mirnas indicating that their numbers are more abundant than previously believed, and argue that they play a major role in evolution.

most of the mirnas identified so far are conserved in other species, some remarkably well <cit> . previous computational screens for mirna have relied on this evolutionary conservation to identify a few hundred putative mirnas in vertebrates <cit> , c. elegans <cit> , and plants  <cit> , and many have been experimentally confirmed . however, these screens miss all mirnas that have diverged since the last common ancestor of the genomes under comparison. a recent study using a combined bioinformatic and high-throughput experimental approach have identified  <dig> mirnas not conserved beyond primates <cit> . in plants, where comparisons have been between the distantly related a. thaliana  and o. sativa  genomes that diverged some  <dig> million years ago <cit> , it is probable that there are mirnas which have escaped detection. of the  <dig> arabidopsis mirna-genes currently registered <cit> , only  <dig> are conserved in the monocot rice , indicating the existence of a substantial number of unconserved mirna-genes. mirna and short interfering rnas  are very similar in function, but different in biogenesis. according to the current nomenclature <cit>  both micrornas  and short interfering rnas  are 20– <dig> nucleotides long single stranded molecules that arise from processing of double stranded rna  precursors. they are distinguished by the type of dsrna they are excised from. while sirnas come from long exogenous or endogenous dsrna molecules , mature mirnas come from the stem region of shorter hairpins.

the mature mirna or sirna forms part of the rna induced silencing complex  that binds to mrnas. mirna/sirnas that bind with almost perfect complementarity to an mrna often results in the cleavage of its target. currently it seems that the higher the degree of complementarity to a target mrna, the larger chance of that target being degraded. mirnas with imperfect complementarity to a 3' untranslated region of a mrna have been shown to inhibit translation of the mrna <cit> 

when the base pairing between the mirna and the target is incomplete it is non-trivial to identify targets for a mirna  <cit> . in plants, however, most of the known mirnas pair almost perfectly with one or more mrnas, making it straightforward to identify likely plant targets . using this observation it is possible to predict mirna candidates in arabidopsis that exhibit near perfect base pairing with the targets, without relying on homology to other organisms <cit> . here this idea is extended and refined to yield a highly specific screen that finds plant mirnas in numbers much larger than previously thought.

RESULTS
identification of non-conserved mirnas
the general approach is outlined in figure  <dig>  initially, a mrna is compared with the genomic sequence to identify matching regions of 20– <dig> nucleotides with at most  <dig> mismatches . these are called micromatches, and the genomic part is referred to as a genomic match. an average mrna gives rise to about  <dig> such micromatches, the vast majority  of which we assume are spurious non-mirna hits. however, it is possible, without comparing to other genomes, to filter the micromatches and achieve highly specific and fairly sensitive predictions of mirna genes .

six filters were used to identify a base set of genomic sequences as candidate mirnas :  they had high sequence complexity ;  they had no overlap with annotated exons on the same or the opposite strand ;  they had no overlap with repeat sequences defined by repeatmasker ;  the putative mirna:mrna duplex should be relatively stable <cit>  with a calculated free energy of less than - <dig> kcal/mol ;  they had no more than identical  <dig> copies in the genome , to eliminate repeated sequences not detected by standard repeat-masking; and  the mirna was contained within a precursor structure that was similar to those observed in known arabidopsis mirna precursors, i.e. was predicted to be largely contained  within the stem of a double stranded stem-loop structure whose stem was predicted to have a free energy less than - <dig> kcal/mol, with at least  <dig> paired bases flanking the putative mirna, and an intervening loop larger than  <dig> but less than  <dig> bases .

although the base set predictions have a low number of false positives , they can be even more refined to identify a subset of the predictions with extra confidence, because the probability of more than one mrna matching a falsely predicted mirna is minimal, unless the matching mrna-targets are close homologs . most of the known mirna in arabidopsis are thought to have multiple targets often within the same family of homologous proteins <cit> . if a known mirna only has targets in a highly conserved protein family this filter can however be expected to falsely eliminate them.

in order to check the validity of our approach we took the mrna targets of the known mirnas and set out to see if using these as queries we would be able to correctly identify the known mirna-genes. of the  <dig> precursor sequences registered in rfam , we were able to map  <dig> perfectly to the current refseq assembly  of the arabidopsis genome; the remaining precursors were excluded from the positive control set. likely targets for arabidopsis mirnas have previously been predicted allowing for up to  <dig> mismatches <cit> . repeating this procedure we find that our known mirnas match  <dig> different annotated mrna*. these are the positive control targets  and many have been experimentally confirmed <cit> . initially, the  <dig> mrnas in the positive control set yielded  <dig>  micromatches after removal of low complexity sequences. however, the filtering procedure reduces this dramatically to  <dig> different loci  representing  <dig> different families . assuming that the 'unknown' loci we find are false positives the procedure has 91% specificity and 45% sensitivity on the level of loci identified. using the refinement step requiring more than one non-homologouos target only true positives are found, but at the expense of halving the sensitivity to 22%. the validity of the estimates of specificity and sensitivity is discussed below.

hundreds of novel mirnas
applying the micromatcher procedure to all  <dig> mrnas annotated in arabidopsis identifies  <dig> mirna candidate loci  in the base set . in the final step this is reduced to a set of  <dig>  when more than one non-homologouos target per mirna is required. this is called the multi-target set and is a subset of the base set.

all mirna gene predictions, their targets  and the predicted secondary structure of the precursor are available as supplementary data , and at our website <cit> 

using public databases we were able to acquire evidence for the expression of a small number of the predictions,  <dig> in the base set overlap with rna molecules recently sequenced in a large scale cloning effort of arabidopsis small rna <dig>   <dig> have significant matches to arabidopsis ests and  <dig> of the predicted precursors contain a 20-mer sequence tag from the arabidopsis mpss database <cit> .

evolutionary conservation of the predicted mirna-genes
from an evolutionary point of view, it would seem to be a lot easier to adapt  <dig> bases in a mirna for a new target than to evolve a protein for a specific regulatory task.

for mammals it has been suggested that the more targets a microrna has the more likely it is to be conserved <cit>  because of the additional constraints of having to match multiple targets.

indeed also for plants: comparison of our predictions in arabidopsis to two other plant species reveals that the more targets a mirna is predicted to have, the more likely it is to be conserved . although no brassica species is yet completely sequenced and we had to use a conjunction of all single sequence brassica entries from genbank, significantly more of the predicted mirnas are conserved in brassica than in rice, indicating that many mirna-genes have diverged beyond recognition since the divergence of monocots and dicots approximately  <dig> million years ago.

thus, we speculate that the highly conserved mirnas are likely to be central regulators, often of many target mrnas , and are more likely to be highly expressed. whereas more recently evolved mirna would have fewer targets, and a more localized spatiotemporal expression, making them less likely to be detected by cloning efforts.

since evolutionary conservation is part of many of the previous discovery procedures, it is likely that the set of known mirnas is biased towards those that are conserved, and our data suggest that in fact, mirnas evolve fast and are less conserved than e.g. protein-coding genes.

it has been proposed that some mirnas originate from inverted duplication of target sequences, exemplified by the single locus mirnas mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  which have precursors that show extended homology to the target mrnas also outside the mature mirna sequence <cit> . however, our structural filters require that the match between mirna and target is in the range 20– <dig>  effectively eliminating such mirna with extended homology.

comparison to other studies
of the predicted  <dig> precursors in the base set,  <dig> overlap with the  <dig> predictions made by bonnet et al. <cit> , and  <dig> of those by wang et al. <cit> . thus, the different methods complement each other: the present method based on matching targets and mirna is capable of finding non-conserved mirnas, whereas the interspecies comparisons <cit>  can find mirnas without obvious targets.

the idea to use potential targets to find mirna-genes has recently been employed in two other studies. xie et al.  <cit>  started by finding frequently occurring subsequences of human 3' utr sequences conserved in other mammals and successfully searched the genome for new mirna genes.

moreover adai and coworkers <cit>  published results in arabidopsis using potential targets to find new mirna-genes. however, our approach differs significantly from theirs in the way the matches  are analysed and the kind of conclusions that can be drawn: adai et al. looks for a 'cluster' of mirna-genes that target the same sequence of a mrna, and then aligns the candidates in such a cluster, scoring the alignment high if it shows a characteristic pattern where the mirna and mirna* are more conserved than the intertwining sequence. thus, their method is limited to finding mirnas that occur more than once in the genome, presumably as a result of duplication events. moreover as a postfilter, adai et al. require conservation in rice to generate their short-list used for experimental validation. also, adai et al. do not make any estimation of the specificity of their computational procedure and are consequently unable to speculate about the number of mirnas.

in contrast our method is independent of whether a candidate has been duplicated in the genome or is conserved across species. instead our aggressive filtering on the structural properties of the precursor enables us to make highly specific prediction .

the multi-target mirnas have a total of  <dig> different mrna targets, which are involved in a variety of functions, but there is a notable over-representation of proteins with transcription factor activity and receptor binding activity as well as involvement in developmental processes . the predicted mirna-genes are generally found scattered throughout the genome . unlike in mammals where  <dig> out of  <dig> mirna-genes are within introns of protein coding genes  <cit> , there is only one previously discovered arabidopsis microrna situated in an intron. this trend of plant micrornas to be outside protein-coding genes also holds for our baseset predictions and even stronger for the multiple target predictions .

although estimating the sensitivity and specificity on the basis of the ability to correctly identify the small set of known mirnas carries the danger of biasing, the presently most important concern must be not to massively overpredict new mirna-genes. in constructing the filters we have therefore aim at high specificity at the expense of sensitivity. while false positives undoubtfully remain, the fact that the predictions share the properties of functional overrepresentation and bias of genomic location  with known mirnas provides independent indication that we indeed do not massively overpredict new mirna-genes.

it is becoming evident that many regions between protein coding genes are transcribed . indeed given the cases of mirnas that have been suggested to regulate other mirnas <cit>  or rnas that guide methylation dna <cit> , it would be interesting to extend our filtered intragenomic match approach to identify other possible mirnas whose targets are not mrnas.

CONCLUSIONS
the present analysis predicts  <dig> new arabidopsis mirna genes with very few false positives  and over five hundred with an estimate of 9% false predictions. the procedure misses some real mirnas, such as those encoded in untranslated regions of genes, those with very many targets , and those not fulfilling our strict structural constraints, and we believe that the real number could be several thousands. although, the predictions should eventually be confirmed in the lab, our data suggest that the arabidopsis genome encodes substantially more mirna genes than previously thought, and that the number of mirnas is comparable to the number of protein transcription factors. our results also indicate that many mirna are specific to small groups of related species and we speculate that they could play a part in speciation. finally we find it unlikely that these conclusions are specific to plants, and we hypothesize that they extend to most other multicellular organisms.
