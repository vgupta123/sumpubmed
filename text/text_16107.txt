BACKGROUND
dna barcoding seeks to develop a comprehensive species-specific sequence library for all eukaryotes  <cit> . the  <dig> bp mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase  <dig>  dna barcode  <cit>  is easily sequenced and provides greater than 97% species-level specificity for birds  <cit> , mammals  <cit> , fishes  <cit> , and various arthropods  <cit> . however, conventional dna barcoding encounters two problems. first, dna degradation in archival specimens and processed biological material  often prevents the recovery of pcr fragments longer than  <dig> bp, impeding barcode recovery  <cit> . second, current approaches cannot be used for comprehensive analysis of environmental samples because high sequence variability necessitates the use of distinct primer sets for each major taxonomic group. in this study, we propose the use of a "mini-barcode" sequence to overcome these problems. we begin by identifying the minimum amount of sequence information required for accurate species identification. we then test the gain in amplification success for smaller fragments in specimens with degraded dna. finally, by targeting conserved priming sites within the barcode region we develop primers with the universality required for the analysis of all major eukaryotes.

RESULTS
to determine how much sequence information is required for identifications, we retrieved all co <dig> barcode sequences from genbank and calculated the probability of having species-specific barcodes for varied size fragments . our analysis shows that while full-length dna barcodes perform best , 90% identification success is obtained with  <dig> bp regions and 95% success with  <dig> bp barcodes. in another words, in 90% of the species tested a dna barcode of only  <dig> bp contains nucleotide substitution specific to members of a particular species. having established the potential of mini-barcodes to identify unknown specimens, we proceeded to design primers and test their performance.

we designed universal primers for amplifying mini-barcodes by aligning co <dig> sequences from all major eukaryote groups  and identifying conserved amino acid strings for primers in the size range 120â€“ <dig> bp. we selected a single primer set for a  <dig> bp amplicon . we tested the ability of this universal primer set to amplify dna extracts from  <dig>  specimens derived from  <dig> species of mammals, fishes, birds, and insects . moreover, we examined another  <dig> dna extracts from plants, fungi, and macroalgae . we obtained pcr amplicons from 92% of these species  and compared this success to that obtained via routine barcoding. we were able to amplify mini-barcodes with greater success than full-length sequences in all groups but one  . we verified that the  <dig> bp amplicons were co <dig> by sequencing approximately half of them .

one important application of mini-barcodes lies in obtaining sequence information from old type specimens. we tested this approach on a collection of coleophora  which are difficult to identify because of their small size and cryptic morphology. we successfully sequenced all  <dig> dried museum specimens collected from  <dig> to  <dig>  in one pcr pass with the universal mini-barcode primers and compared these specimens to  <dig> full-length barcodes from recently collected specimens of this genus . comparison of sequence information obtained from these old specimens with recently collected samples provided excellent corroboration and species-level resolution. mini-barcode sequences from old museum specimens formed monophyletic groups, containing zero or very low sequence divergence, with freshly collected specimens of the corresponding species .

CONCLUSIONS
the mini-barcode system dramatically broadens the applications of dna barcoding. we have now demonstrated that sequence information can be reliably obtained from archival specimens or those with degraded dna. further, the universality of the primers enables the recovery of comprehensive barcode information from environmental mixtures. finally, the short universally-primed amplicon is ideal for sequence characterization through new parallelized high-throughput sequencing technologies, allowing inexpensive but comprehensive studies of biodiversity to be a realistic goal.
