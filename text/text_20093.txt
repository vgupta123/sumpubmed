BACKGROUND
legumes comprise a diverse and ecologically significant plant family that serves as the second most important crop family in the world  <cit> . as a cool season legume, medicago truncatula is closely related to important crops such as alfalfa , clover , pea , chickpea , and lotus japonicas  <cit> . m. truncatula was chosen as a model for studying legume biology due to its small genome size, simple diploid genetics, self-fertility, short generation time, amenability to genetic transformation and large collections of diverse ecotypes . m. truncatula research has focused especially on its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizae, root development, secondary metabolism and disease resistance  <cit> . a high quality, bac-based sequence has served as the original “reference genome” for the medicago research community  <cit>  while re-sequencing of additional accessions has enriched the pool of sequence data available  <cit> .

in plants, large gene families play a crucial role in both biotic interactions and abiotic response. some of these families are encoded by hundreds of members  organized in clusters of varying size and thought to evolve through gene duplication and birth-and-death processes . widely studied examples include the nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat proteins , receptor-like kinases , f-box proteins, leucine-rich repeat proteins , heat shock proteins , and protein kinases . in m. truncatula and close taxonomic relatives, an additional gene family is important in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides , a sub-family within the larger cysteine-rich peptide  superfamily . legume ncrs are highly expressed in rhizobial nodules  <cit>  where they act as plant effectors directing bacteroid differentiation  <cit> . ncr genes are abundant, diverse, and frequently clustered  <cit> .

previous studies of plant genomes highlighted the important role that gene families play in the architecture of structural variation  . array-based re-sequencing of  <dig> arabidopsis accessions indicated that 60% of nbs-lrrs, 25% of f-box, and 16% of rlks exhibited some type of major-effect polymorphism compared with less than 10% for all expressed sequences  <cit> . in arabidopsis,  <dig> % of the nbs-lrr genes in the columbia reference are deleted in at least one of  <dig> accessions compared with just  <dig> % of genes in the arabidopsis genome as a whole  <cit> . in rice, schatz et al  <cit>  re-sequenced three divergent genomes and found that genes containing the nb-arc domain  constituted 12% of lineage-specific genes compared with just  <dig> % of genes shared among all three genomes.

in contrast to earlier alignment-based  studies of sequence diversity, de novo sequencing and assembly of genomes from multiple accessions enables near-comprehensive discovery of svs, gene family membership, and ultimately, construction of a pan-genome. here, we describe de novo genome assemblies for 15 m. truncatula accessions, which we analyze together with the m. truncatula reference. we were especially interested in the level and type of svs found in different gene families, with a focus on families associated with biotic interactions and abiotic stress. our results illustrate how different gene families exhibit distinctly different variant architectures, including differing representation within the dispensable portion of the pan-genome.

RESULTS
de novo assemblies have scaffold n50s > 250 kb, capturing > 90% of the m. truncatula gene space
fifteen m. truncatula accessions were sequenced with illumina hiseq <dig> using a combination of short and long insert paired-end libraries to an average of 120-fold coverage, then assembled using allpaths-lg  <cit>  . between  <dig> and 94% of each genome could be assembled into scaffolds > <dig> kbp, with scaffold n50s ranging from  <dig> kbp to  <dig>  kbp and contig n <dig> sizes averaging around  <dig> kbp . assembled genome sizes ranged from  <dig> mbp to  <dig> mbp , correlating well with cytologically derived genome size estimates . genomes were repeat-masked with a medicago-specific repeat database  <cit> . about 20% of each assembly was annotated as repeat, which is slightly lower than the 23% repetitive content in medicago reference mt <dig> ,  . the de novo assemblies also capture 87–96% of unique content in the reference genome, including 90–96% of all mt <dig>  gene coding regions.

genic features in de novo assemblies largely resemble those of the reference
all  <dig> genome assemblies were annotated using augustus  <cit>  incorporating ab initio gene prediction results, rna-seq expression evidence from a subset of accessions as well as protein homolog support from mt <dig>  reference gene models . evidence-guided annotation yielded comparable numbers of coding genes  for each of the  <dig> assemblies . on average 80–90% of predicted gene models receive support from either rna-seq expression or mt <dig>  syntenic homologs. the number of te-related genes in different accessions  was up to 25% lower than in the mt <dig>  reference, indicating that some de novo assemblies missed or collapsed repetitive sequences. a closer look at the number of te categories suggests certain families were more likely to be missed or collapsed than others . median protein length  ranged from 245– <dig> amino acids – nearly equal to the estimate of  <dig> aas in mt <dig> .

structural variants span as much as 22% of the m. truncatula genome
between  <dig> and 96% of each assembly could be aligned with the mt <dig>  reference typically leading to ~ <dig> mbp of sequences in syntenic blocks where single nucleotide polymorphisms , short indels, and large svs could be confidently predicted . global comparisons revealed long syntenic blocks intermixed with shorter, poorly aligned regions that harbor numerous structural changes . the pattern of synteny alignment generally reflects across-accession relationships inferred from snp data , including three “outgroup” accessions  that are typically considered separate sub-species with distinct diversity patterns compared with the remaining accessions.fig.  <dig> heatmap showing percent covered by synteny alignment for each 1 mb window in  <dig> de novo m. truncatula assemblies , reference gap position , percent bases covered by synteny blocks in at least  <dig> out  <dig> accessions , nucleotide diversity  for snps , short indels  and large svs , as well as gene density of different categories . nucleotide diversity  estimates were calculated using only  <dig> “ingroup” m. truncatula accessions

within aligned genomic regions, extensive variation including snps, short indels, and large svs were observed. between  <dig>  million  and  <dig>  million  snps were identified in comparisons with hm <dig>  . as expected, snp density correlates well with divergence from hm <dig> – with snp bp- <dig> ranging from  <dig> % in hm <dig>  to  <dig> % in hm <dig> . estimates of nucleotide diversity  are nearly 70% higher than previous reports    <cit> . approximately 70% of medicago snps were found in intergenic regions, which are also distinguished by the highest level of nucleotide diversity  . diversity was much higher for synonymous than replacement polymorphisms in coding regions . these findings are consistent with the expectation of stronger purifying selection acting at replacement sites, especially large-effect polymorphisms that significantly alter the protein product  <cit> .

beyond snps, we identified  <dig> – <dig> , <dig> short indels ,  <dig> – <dig>  large indels,  <dig> – <dig>  copy number variants , and  <dig> – <dig>  translocations. svs were identified through a rigorous syntenic anchoring approach with each sv receiving support from synteny alignments of both flanking sequences and being free from any intra- or inter- scaffold gaps . nevertheless, these number may still underestimate the true level of variation given that 4–8% of each genome could not be covered by our synteny alignment and therefore likely to involve additional complex changes . in count, svs are far less numerous than single-base variants, yet each of these sv classes affects more total base pairs. small indels affect 3– <dig> mbp, large insertions and deletions affect  <dig>  to  <dig> mbp, cnvs affect 26– <dig> mbp, and translocations affect  <dig>  to  <dig> mbp . altogether between 7%  and 22%  of genome content is affected by at least one type of structural change . this is consistent with findings in other systems where large variants typically affect more bases than snps  <cit> . nearly equivalent numbers of small insertions versus deletions were observed in contrast to traditional read mapping-based approaches . nonetheless, large deletions and copy number losses were still 30–50% higher, even with our use of synteny-based variant discovery, indicating reduced power in detecting large insertions and copy number gains .

to estimate the accuracy of our sv prediction, we performed pacbio sequencing on three accessions . for each sv, the number of pacbio reads fully spanning ±500 bp of the breakpoints was counted and scored as valid only if each of its breakpoints received at least five supporting pacbio reads. based on these criteria, between  <dig> and 94% of all synteny-based sv calls could be validated using long read technology . insertion and deletion of unique  genomic contents tended to have higher validation rates than gain or loss of repetitive genomic contents . this is consistent with assembly quality in repetitive regions generally being lower than in unique regions. also, svs involving genic regions tend to have the highest validation rates compared with other genomic contexts . some of the genic svs provide good candidates in studying gene birth-and-death processes. as an example, we identified a tandem duplication of a nbs-lrr gene in hm <dig>  which is supported by long pacbio reads  interestingly, the altered gene copy doesn’t have rna-seq expression, whereas all the neighboring copies do, a possible indication of pseudogene removal.

global comparisons revealed long, conserved syntenic blocks intermixed with shorter, poorly aligned regions that harbor numerous structural changes . the global pattern of synteny alignment generally reflect the medicago phylogeny – with three “outgroup” accessions  that are typically considered separate sub-species showing distinct diversity pattern from the remaining accessions . nevertheless, peri-centromeric locations generally display increased levels of diversity  due to enrichment of transposable elements  . in genomic regions where synteny disappears altogether, our ability to identify different variant types  also disappears. this is illustrated in fig.  <dig>  where high densities of tes and selected gene families  are associated with reduced synteny coverage and loss of power in detecting all variant types . non-centromeric regions with higher te density show high level of diversity and reduced synteny . like tes, large clusters of nbs-lrrs, rlks and lrrs lead to fragile genome architecture and higher level of diversity . genomic locations of these gene family clusters are generally uncorrelated with one another, but there are notable examples they co-localize . in these highlighted regions, substantial clusters of nbs-lrrs, rlks, ncrs, lrrs and f-box genes are all found within a single 1 mb segment.

 <dig> mbp is dispensable sequence out of a total pan-genome content of  <dig> mbp
sequences that could not be aligned to the mt <dig>  reference even at relaxed stringency  were extensive across the  <dig> de novo assemblies. these sequences often exist in the form of novel insertions or complex substitutions, sometimes as separate scaffolds. after filtering potential contaminant sequences, we identified between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp of novel segments  longer than 50 bp among the  <dig> de novo assemblies . all-against-all alignments were made among these novel segments  and a total of  <dig> mbp non-redundant novel sequences were identified, with 47%  present in two or more accessions and 53%  being specific to a single accession .fig.  <dig> sharing status of the medicago pan-genome  and the pan-genome size curve 




size curves for both pan- and core-genomes were obtained by adding one genome to the population pool at a time . for this analysis, only the  <dig> “ingroup” accessions out of the total  <dig> were used, excluding the three distinct sub-species accessions . the core-genome size curve drops quickly at first, flattening once  <dig> accessions are added, though still slightly negative in slope even at the point where all  <dig> have been added. approximately  <dig> mbp sequences are shared among the  <dig> “ingroup” accessions representing conserved regions that presumably play core functions in all m. truncatula . another ~ <dig> mbp is missing from at least one accession , reflecting the dynamic nature of genome content and prevalence of indels and other svs . the corresponding pan-genome size curve sees steady increases each time a new genome is added, approaching  <dig> mbp when all  <dig> accessions have been added. indeed, fitting the observed pan-genome curve using a asymptotic regression model led to estimates for the total pan-genome size of  <dig> mbp and a core-genome of  <dig> mbp for m. truncatula.


to understand the effect of sequence variation on gene families, we annotated all de novo assemblies and systematically identified orthologous relationships for each gene among the  <dig> ingroup accessions – i.e., the entire collection of ortholog groups in the population. we placed a total of 607 k non-te genes  into 75 k ortholog groups based on sequence similarity. on average each ortholog group contained  <dig>  protein sequences coming from six different accessions . in addition to the 37 k reference  ortholog groups, this analysis resulted in another 38 k ortholog groups with no hm <dig> members. we identified a substantial number  of accession-specific genes that were only observed in a single accession,  <dig>  k ortholog groups shared by 2– <dig> accessions, and 24 k more shared among all  <dig> . accession-specific ortholog groups numbered as few as  <dig>  specific to accession hm <dig> and as many as  <dig>  specific to hm <dig> fig.  <dig> sharing status of medicago protein ortholog groups




variation in different gene families results from differing mechanisms
several different diversity measures were estimated for different gene families . the θπ statistic, large effect snp change, and mean protein pairwise distance are metrics that provide insights into the rates of evolution for different gene families, while the coefficient of variation  of ortholog groups tracks the level of copy number variation . the gene families we examined exhibit distinctly different patterns of variation compared with the genome as a whole and among themselves . nbs-lrrs are in every aspect like tes, showing the highest snp diversity , most frequent large-effect snp changes , highest mean pairwise protein distance , enrichment in accession-specific gene content, and highest ortholog group size coefficient of variation  . lrrs and hsps show intermediate levels of snp diversity and pairwise protein distance, but are frequently affected by large effect snp changes and even higher cnv . rlks, f-box proteins and ncrs all show elevated levels of certain diversity measures, but are much less diverse then nbs-lrrs, lrrs or hsps. interestingly, protein kinases show high cnv despite low levels of snp diversity and pairwise protein distance. differences in variant architecture among gene families are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  where the percent sequence similarity between the reference gene model and its syntenic orthologs in the other  <dig> accessions is shown for three example protein families . both the ncr and nbs-lrr protein families are clearly more variable than zinc-fingers, but nbs-lrrs exhibit more orthologs with significant sequence dissimilarities  as well as higher numbers of cnvs .fig.  <dig> diversity estimates of different gene families:  snp-based nucleotide diversity ,  proportion members affected by different types of large-effect snps,  mean pairwise protein distance for syntenic ortholog groups and  coefficient of variation  of gene copy number in each ortholog group  among accessions. numbers in parenthesis reflect:  &  number of genes where ≥80% of the cds regions were covered in at least  <dig> out of the  <dig> accessions;  number of syntenic ortholog groups where syntenic orthologs were present in ≥ <dig> accessions ;  number of orthomcl-defined ortholog groups based entirely on protein sequence similarity

we further examined these gene families to estimate their contribution to accession-specific ortholog groups . most striking were tes,  <dig> % of which were accession-specific compared with just  <dig> % in the core set of ortholog groups . likewise, lrrs , nbs-lrrs , hsp70s  and protein kinases  were all over-represented in terms of accession-specific ortholog groups. by contrast, ncrs , f-box proteins  and rlks   all showed lower rates of representation in the accession-specific portion of the genome.

discussion
synteny analysis based on de novo assemblies effectively discovers snps, small indels and large svs
exploring plant genome variation increasingly involves the sequencing of multiple accessions within a species. early efforts simply aligned short reads against a reference to discover snps and short indels . this includes our own earlier surveys of m. truncatula variation  <cit>  as well as similar studies in arabidopsis, maize, soybean, rice and others . in these previous analyses, variation in very divergent or repetitive regions, as well as larger and more complex types of variation would typically have been overlooked. recent studies have turned to de novo genome assembly combined with synteny comparison as a basis for exploring genome variation. in arabidopsis, sequencing and assembling multiple genomes led to the discovery of  <dig>  mb col- <dig> sequences missing in at least one other accession along with unprecedented proteome diversity  <cit> . in soybean, comparison of multiple wild relatives against the reference found that 20% of the genome and  <dig> % of gene families were dispensable and also identified hundreds of lineage-specific genes as well as genes exhibiting cnvs as potential targets of selection  <cit> . sequencing three divergent rice strains revealed several megabases of novel sequences specific to one strain  <cit> . in the present study, we deeply re-sequenced 15 m. truncatula accessions and used the allpaths-lg algorithm to create high quality assemblies followed by synteny comparison as a basis for global variant discovery. the resulting genome assemblies had scaffold n50s >250 kb and synteny coverage >92% of the m. truncatula reference mt <dig> . synteny-based estimates of θw  suggests the level of diversity is 30% higher than original read-mapping published estimates   <cit> . looking at θπ , the underestimate is 70%, though this could be due, in part, to a more complete reference, deeper sequencing of the accessions used in this study, and/or population structure among the selected accessions. examination of the syntenic blocks enabled extensive, high confidence discovery of svs, including most large indels, cnvs and translocations. these svs affect 7–22% of the alignable genome space for each medicago accession, with large indels spanning as much as  <dig> mbp per accession and cnvs affecting as much as  <dig> mbp . the values reported here provide a better estimate of genomic diversity within m. truncatula, allowing for divergent genomic regions to be assessed accurately and helping to resolve repetitive and variable genomic regions and gene families.

the medicago pan-genome largely resembles that of other analyzed plant species

de novo sequencing of multiple accessions enabled us to construct a draft pan-genome for m. truncatula, indicating a core genome of ~ <dig> mbp and a dispensable genome of ~ <dig> mbp . annotation of the medicago de novo genomes followed by clustering using orthomcl resulted in a core set of  <dig>   ortholog groups present in all m. truncatula accessions sequenced and another  <dig>   that are dispensable . as de novo genomes were added during the pan-genome analysis, the rate of increase declined quickly, with both the pan-genome and core-genome curves nearly flat with the last genome added. limited novel sequence discovery would therefore be expected with the addition of further accession genomes. indeed, our estimation suggests an asymptotic pan-genome size of  <dig> mbp and core-genome of  <dig> mbp . similar trends have been observed in pan-genomic analyses of seven de novo glycine soja genome  <cit> , ten brassica oleracea genomes  <cit> , as well as a pan-transcriptome analysis  <dig> maize accessions  <cit> , results that together suggest higher plant pan-genomes may generally be restricted in size. the finding that 67% of medicago ortholog groups are dispensable is likewise comparable to earlier estimates of 51% in the g. soja analysis mentioned above  <cit> , 73% in a study of five oryza aa genomes  <cit> , and 83% of the representative transcript assemblies  in the pan-transcriptome analysis of maize  <cit> . all these values are higher, however, than an estimate of just ~20% dispensable gene families observed in the study of the b. oleracea pan-genome, an observation that might be attributable to their focus on cultivated genotypes  <cit> .

important caveats should be kept in mind when interpreting these results. due to the incompleteness of the de novo medicago assemblies , sequences present in one assembly but absent in others could have been due to technical artifact. this would have resulted in overestimates of dispensable genome size. by contrast, the pan-genome size estimate should be more robust since it surveys novel sequences across all accessions – and it is much less likely that a given genome region would be missed in all assemblies.

differences in variant architecture among different gene families
genome regions high in svs often coincide with genome regions rich in either tes or one of the biotic interaction and stress related gene families examined in this study . this is a relationship that has frequently been observed in plant genomes , but in our study, we were especially interested in the range and type of svs found in different gene families . nbs-lrrs are the most variable and the most like tes in their variant structure. both nbs-lrrs and tes exhibit frequent large-effect snp changes, very high levels of protein diversity , enrichment in the accession-specific gene content, and high levels of cnvs . while lrrs and hsps only exhibit intermediate levels of snp diversity and protein diversity, they are frequently affected by large effect snp changes and even higher levels of cnv. like nbs-lrrs, these two gene families are over-represented in accession-specific gene content. by contrast, protein kinases show notably low snp and protein diversity together with high levels of cnvs and over-representation in accession-specific content. finally, rlks, f-box proteins, and ncrs are all much less diverse than the other families studied here. not surprisingly, they are also under-represented in terms of accession-specific gene content. some of these differences make sense when considering the genome features of different gene families. for example, nbs-lrrs have long been known to include a large proportion of pseudogenes  <cit> , a feature thought to result from the value of maintaining a reservoir of genetic diversity against future pathogen pressure. consequently, very high levels of large-effect snps are to be expected. likewise, nbs-lrrs are large, multi-module proteins, so high levels of protein diversity, often involving domain swapping, should be common . by contrast, ncr genes, which are just as numerous and comparably clustered in the m. truncatula genome, code for expressed, short, single peptide, modular proteins  <cit> . not surprisingly, ncrs are quite low in large effect snps.

limitations remain in de novo assemblies based on short read sequencing technology
even with very deep re-sequencing and de novo assembly using the allpaths-lg algorithm, important limitations remain. the contig n <dig> for most assemblies was only 20 kb and any of the thousands of sequencing gap potentially represents a missing sv. we also lacked the ability to discover svs in regions without synteny to the mt <dig>  reference. altogether, these missing regions account for 4–8% of the genome space for each medicago accession. moreover, gaps remaining in the mt <dig>  reference reduce its effectiveness as a framework for sv discovery. these factors all presumably result in missed sv calls. nevertheless, the svs we did predict could largely be validated. by comparing svs discovered in the allpaths assemblies of three m. truncatula accessions to  long uninterrupted reads coming from pacbio sequencing, we confirmed 88–94% of sv predictions from our synteny analysis. as more pacbio and other long read technologies are used to resequence and assemble genomes, fewer gaps will remain and analyses of svs, dynamic gene families, and pan-genomes will become more complete and accurate.

CONCLUSIONS
analysis of multiple m. truncatula genomes illustrates the value of de novo assemblies to discover and describe structural variation, something that is often under-estimated when using read-mapping approaches. comparisons among the de novo assemblies also indicate that different large gene families differ in the architecture of their structural variation.
