BACKGROUND
after nitrogen, phosphorus is the most frequently limiting plant macronutrient  <cit> . despite its abundance in the soil, most of it is present in a form which is not readily accessible to plants  <cit> . the application of phosphate-based fertilizer can correct deficiency, but even when provided in a highly accessible form, as little as 10% of the phosphorus applied is recovered by plants  <cit> , with the remainder either becoming immobilized or lost through run-off  <cit> . the availability of economically viable sources of phosphate fertilizer is declining  <cit> . there is thus some urgency associated with efforts to promote the efficiency with which crop plants are able to take up phosphate.

the concentration of inorganic phosphate  in plant tissues lies in the range 5–20 mm  <cit> , whereas the level available in a typical soil is three orders of magnitude lower than this  <cit> . thus the acquisition of pi occurs against a steep concentration gradient  <cit> . pi uptake by plants operates via both a low and a high affinity system  <cit> . the high affinity route is largely mediated by plasma membrane-localized pi transporters belonging to the phosphate transporter <dig>  family  <cit> . following the identification of pi transporters in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , a large number of pt genes have been identified and characterized in a wide range of species such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , rice  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , maize  <cit> , barley  <cit> , medicago truncatula <cit> , populus trichocarpa <cit> , and soybean  <cit> .

the chrysanthemum  is a leading ornamental species. its productivity is usually compromised when grown in phosphate deficient soils. here, we describe the isolation of a pht <dig> homolog present in the chrysanthemum variety ‘nannongyinshan’, a cultivar which is relatively tolerant of phosphate deficiency  <cit> . the gene’s transcription profile was characterized and the beneficial effect of its constitutive expression on the plant’s ability to cope with phosphate deficiency was demonstrated.

methods
plant material and growing conditions
cuttings of the chrysanthemum cultivar ‘nannongyinshan’ were obtained from the chrysanthemum germplasm resource preserving centre, nanjing agricultural university, china, ‘nannongyinshan’ was a low phosphorus tolerant cultivar in our privious study, and ‘jinba’ is a low phosphorus intolerant cultivar compared to ‘nannongyinshan’  <cit> . the cuttings were raised in a greenhouse in a 1: <dig> mixture of perlite and vermiculite, without any fertilizer supplementation. after two weeks, the plants were up-rooted, their roots were washed free of the rooting medium and the plants were transferred to a hydroponic solution consisting of a diluted  hoagland’s solution  <cit> . the phosphate treatments were initiated one week after the transfer, by removing three plants to an aerated hydroponic solution containing either  <dig>  or  <dig>  μm pi. the nutrient solution was replaced every three days. leaf, stem and root tissue was harvested after a further  <dig> days, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°c.

isolation of cmpt1
the design of a pair of degenerate pcr primers  was based on a peptide alignment of the pht <dig> sequences of arabidopsis thaliana , capsicum frutescens , lupinus albus , hordeum vulgare  and petunia x hybrida . total rna was extracted from the roots of p <dig> treated ‘nannongyinshan’ plants using the rnaiso reagent . a full length chrysanthemum cdna sequence  was isolated using race technology, following  <cit> . the race primer sequences are given in table  <dig> 

sequence analysis
the open reading frame  of the full length cdna isolated from ‘nannongyinshan’ was identified using the orf finder program . the location of hydrophobic and putative transmembrane domains was enabled through the software package mounted at http://expasy.org/tools/protscale.html. multiple peptide alignments were carried out using dnaman software , and phylogenetic analyses using clustal x and mega v <dig>  software.

cmpt <dig> transcription profiling
total rna was extracted from root, stem and leaf tissue of plants grown both in the + p and -p treatments using the rnaiso reagent, and was then used as the template for real-time quantitative pcr  assays, based on the sybr green master mix  and the gene-specific primer pair qgsp-f/-r , which generated a 163 bp fragment. the reference sequence was a 151 bp fragment of ef-1a, amplified with the primers ef1a -f/-r . each 20 μl rt-qpcr contained 10 μl sybr green master mix, 10 ng cdna template and  <dig>  μm of each primer. the pcr program comprised an initial denaturation step , followed by  <dig> cycles of 95°c/15 s, 60°c/15 s, 72°c/45 s. relative transcription levels were estimated using the 2-ΔΔct
 method  <cit> .

complementation of a yeast mutant strain defective for pi uptake
the function of the chrysamthemum gene  was studied by its heterologous expression in yeast strain mb <dig>  which lacks phosphate transporter activity. first, the cmpt <dig> orf was amplified using a phusion high-fidelity pcr kit  based on the primer pair cmpt1-ecor-f/not-r , and the resulting amplicon was digested with ecori and noti and then introduced into the yeast expression vector p112a1ne. the structure of the resulting recombinant plasmid  was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and dna sequencing. mb <dig> cells were transformed with either p112a1ne-cmpt <dig> or with the empty p112a1ne vector. transgenic cells were grown in a yeast nitrogen base  medium until up to the logarithmic phase, and the medium was then replaced with a range of pi concentrations  and the cells left to grow for a further 20 h. bromocresol purple was used to indicate the ph of the medium, giving a color shift, from yellow to purple, during the acidification of the liquid medium: this change correlated well with the growth of the yeast cells  <cit> . thereafter, the cells were transferred into ynb medium containing 60 μm pi for a further 40 h. the optical density of the yeast cultures was measured every 8 h. the ph dependence of pi uptake was studied by growing the cells in a series of mes-based ynb buffers containing 60 μm pi at a ph of between  <dig> and  <dig>  the kinetic properties of cmpt <dig> were analysed by feeding the transformed yeast cells with 32p labelled pi, following the methods described by  <cit> . the k
m
 value was calculated using graphpad v <dig>  software.

construction of an constitutive expression vector and the development of transgenic plants
cmpt <dig> was inserted into the pbig vector  under the control of the camv 35s promoter. the structure of the resulting pbig-cmpt <dig> recombinant plasmid was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and dna sequencing, and was then transformed into agrobacterium tumefaciens strain eha <dig> via the heat shock method  <cit> . the recipient of the transgene was the chrysanthemum cultivar ‘jinba’, which is intolerant of phosphate deficiency  <cit> . transformation was effected using a slightly modified form of the procedure described by  <cit> . explants developing multiple shoots were transferred to a selective regeneration medium, with the addition of  <dig>  mg · l- <dig> 6-ba,  <dig>  mg · l- <dig> naa, 10 mg · l- <dig> kanamycin and 300 mg · l- <dig> carbenicillin. regenerating shoots were then rooted by transferring the material to a half-strength murashige and skoog medium containing  <dig>  mg · l- <dig> kanamycin and 200 mg · l- <dig> carbenicillin. after acclimation, kanamycin-resistant plants were transplanted to soil and grown on in a greenhouse.

the phenotype of transgenic lines constitutively expressing cmpt1
verification of transformation was obtained by a pcr assay of genomic dna isolated from both presumptively transformed rooted plants, primed with the oligonucleotide pair 35 s-f/-r  which targets the camv 35s promoter sequence. the pcr was initiated by a denaturation step , along with non-transformed ‘jinba’ plants were exposed to either pi-sufficient  and p-deficiency  conditions for  <dig> days. each assay involved three replicates of a set of ten plants per genotype. plant height, root volume, total dry biomass and the phosphate concentration in the whole plant were measured. the root volume was obtained by displacement  <cit> . dry weight was obtained by weighing plants held at 80°c for three days. the whole plant phosphate concentration was estimated from a ~ <dig>  g sample of dry matter, following  <cit> .

RESULTS
cmpt <dig> encodes a pht <dig> pi transporter
the full-length cmpt <dig> cdna was a  <dig>  bp sequence, consisting of a  <dig>  bp orf, an 87 bp 5′-utr and a 189 bp 3′-utr . its predicted translation product was a  <dig> residue polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and a pi of  <dig> . the protein contains  <dig> transmembrane domains with a large hydrophilic loop between tm <dig> and tm <dig> . the peptide sequence shares a high level of homology with known high affinity plant pht <dig> proteins:  <dig> % with atpt <dig> ,  <dig> % with lept <dig> ,  <dig> % with ospt <dig>  and  <dig> % with mtpt <dig>  . a phylogenetic analysis showed that the chrysanthemum sequence is closely related with other plant pi transporters, and particularly with its tomato homolog lept <dig>  . the pht <dig> signature sequence ggdyplsatixse  <cit>  is present in cmpt <dig> 

transcription of cmpt1
cmpt <dig> transcription was strong in the root, weak in the stem, and below the level of detection in the leaf of plants exposed to either under both pi-sufficient  and pi-deficient  conditions . the relative transcript abundance in the root of + p and -p plants was, respectively,  <dig>  and  <dig> , and in the stem, respectively  <dig>  and  <dig> .

complementation test in yeast
yeast strain mb <dig> cells heterologously expressing cmpt <dig>  were able to survive at  <dig>  mm pi, and grew well at  <dig>  mm pi; neither wild type  cells, nor mb <dig> cells containing only yp <dig> could do so. at  <dig>  mm pi, all cell types grew equally well . both wt and yp112-cmpt <dig> cells grew faster at ph 4– <dig> than at 7– <dig> . the ph optimum for yp112-cmpt <dig> was around  <dig>  whereas for the wt it was 4– <dig>  the results are consistent with the notion that cmpt <dig> operates as an h+/h2po <dig> symporter. to exclude interference from the activity of other pts , the dynamics of pi transport of cells transformed with either p112a1ne-cmpt <dig> or the empty vector was monitored at  <dig>  mm pi. the estimated mean k
m
 of cmpt <dig> was  <dig>  μm pi, as determined from three independent experiments . thus, cmpt <dig> is likely a high pi affinity transporter, mediating pi uptake in the micromolar range.

cmpt <dig> constitutive expression in chrysanthemum enhances tolerance to pi deficiency
six independent rooted presumptive cmpt <dig> transformants were selected by the genomic pcr assay . when subjected to qrt-pcr, it was clear that the level of cmpt <dig> transcription in cmpt1-oe <dig> and cmpt1-oe <dig> was significantly higher than in the wild type plant both at pi-sufficient  and p-deficiency  conditions . the effect cmpt <dig> constitutive expression was to promote root growth and increase the accumulation of phosphate at + p , while at -p, the plant height of the two transgenic plants was increased by respectively  <dig> % and  <dig> % over that of the wild type ; similarly, root volume in both transgenics was enhanced by, respectively,  <dig> % and  <dig> % , dry weight by  <dig> % and  <dig> % and phosphate concentration by  <dig> % and  <dig> % . thus the constitutive expression of cmpt <dig> helped chrysanthemum plants to cope with phosphate deficiency.

discussion
the uptake of pi from a heterogeneous, constantly fluctuating environment is a major challenge faced by all plants. the process is largely governed by pht <dig> transporters  <cit> . the predicted product of the chrysanthemum pht <dig> homologue extracted from the cultivar ‘nannongyinshan’ forms  <dig> transmembrane domains, separated into two groups of six by a charged hydrophilic loop . this structural arrangement is typical for pht <dig> transporters  <cit> . the cmpt <dig> sequence shares a high level of sequence identity to other known high affinity pi transporters and includes the signature sequence ggdyplsatixse. a number of members of the pht <dig> family are strongly expressed in the root, and are induced by phosphate starvation  <cit> , just as was the case for cmpt <dig> . nevertheless its pattern of transcription is not completely the same as that of certain high affinity pi transporters, in particular those of lept <dig>  which is transcribed in both the root and the leaf of tomato  <cit> , and ospt <dig> which is also transcribed in the rice grain  <cit> . cmpt <dig> transcript abundance was below the level of detection in the leaf, even in plants growing under phosphate deficient growing conditions, while its level in the stem was low but still discernible. the evidence as a whole strongly suggests that cmpt <dig> acts as a pi transporter in chrysanthemum.

several approaches have been used to investigate the pi transport properties of the various pht <dig> family members. in our study, cmpt <dig> was able to complement the loss of high affinity pi transporter activity of the yeast mutant mb <dig> in the high affinity concentration range . its estimated km of  <dig>  μm  lies within the k
m
 range of other plant high affinity phosphate transporters, measured by a similar method – the range being from 13 μm to 97 μm  <cit> . heterologous expression in yeast provides an informative means of characterizing plant proteins, but the system does have some limitations with respect to assessing the kinetics of plant phosphate transporters, the yeast complementation only partially reflects the behavior of pht <dig> proteins in plants  <cit> . estimates of k
m
 obtained by transcription in suspension cultures are substantially lower:  <dig>  μm for a. thaliana pht <dig> when transcribed in tobacco cells  <cit> ;  <dig>  μm for the barley protein horvu;pht1; <dig> when expressed in rice cells  <cit> . it may be possible to obtain a more accurate estimate of km to cmpt <dig> by using a homologous system in the future.

transcription of the gene encoding the primary transporter is often considered to be the control point in pathways of nutrient uptake  <cit> . many efforts have been made to research the function of the pt genes and the possibility of using the pt genes to improve the adaptability to pi-deficient stress of crops. overexpression of an arabidopsis thaliana high-affinity phosphate transporter gene in tobacco cultured cells enhances cell growth under phosphate-limited conditions  <cit> . suspension cells of transgenic rice that over-expressed a high-affinity phosphate transporter hvpt <dig> were able to take up phosphate at a much higher rate than control cells  <cit> , but over-expression of the same gene in transgenic barley plants does not enhance phosphate uptake rates at the whole plant level  <cit> . park transferred a high-affinity phosphate transporter gene from tobacco  to rice enhanced phosphate uptake and accumulation under low-p condition  <cit> . over-expressing low affinity phosphate transporter genes ospt <dig> and ospt <dig> in rice cannot bring significant differences to the transgenic plants under pi-deficient supply  <cit> . here, a pht <dig> transporter gene which cloned from a low p tolerant cultivar of cut chrysanthemum ‘nannongyinshan’ transferred to ‘jinba’, a low p sensitive cultivar, the growth of transgenic plants was significantly improved over that of the non-transformed ones under pi deficient conditions . considering the two cultivars sharing the same sequence of cmpt <dig> and the transgenic and non-transgenic plants having same genetic background, physiological and biochemical changes are direct results of the overexpression of cmpt <dig> gene. two possibilities can be envisaged to explain mechanisms of these changes. more copies of the transporter protein are inserted into the plasma membrane in the overexpression transgenic lines. evidence for the transcriptional control of pt activity has been shown by parallel increases in pt transcript and protein levels detected by high-affinity pt antibody in tomato  <cit> . the cmpt <dig> gene may participate in the pi-starvation signal transduction pathways, overexpression of the cmpt <dig> gene directly or indirectly caused pi-dependent root architecture alteration with enhanced root elongation and proliferated lateral root growth , these responses enable the optimization of soil exploration and of the absorptive surface area of the root  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, cmpt <dig> encodes a typical, root-expressed, high affinity phosphate transporter in chrysanthemum. taking the flexible expression pattern into account, cmpt <dig> might function in a wide range of pi environments and play a significant role in phosphate acquisition under natural conditions.
