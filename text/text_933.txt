BACKGROUND
the nervous system is assembled from disparate classes of neurons that together define the overall properties of the network. the specific functions of these neurons are governed by genetic programs that control cell fate  <cit> . thus, a key to understanding the molecular basis for neural function is to establish the gene expression blueprint that orchestrates neuronal differentiation. with its simple, well-defined nervous system and powerful genetics, the nematode c. elegans is a useful model system for addressing this issue. the c. elegans hermaphrodite nervous system is composed of exactly  <dig> neurons. the morphology and connectivity of each one of these neurons has been defined at high resolution  <cit> . in addition, the birth of each neuroblast is embedded in a lineage diagram of every cell division in c. elegans development  <cit> . the c. elegans genome is fully sequenced and contains ~ <dig>  predicted genes  <cit> . at a fundamental level, the identity of a given class of neuron is defined by a unique combination of these genes. in principle, microarray-based strategies could be employed to establish these cell-specific patterns of gene expression. however, the small size of the nematode has limited access to individual cells for molecular analysis. here we describe a strategy, mapcel  that overcomes these obstacles to generate neuron-specific gene expression profiles.

mapcel exploits recently developed methods of culturing c. elegans embryonic cells. gfp markers for specific classes of neurons and muscle cells are expressed in vitro and can be used to identify the corresponding differentiated cell types. we established that these gfp cells arise at a frequency predicted by their abundance in the intact embryo and display normal morphological, molecular, and physiological characteristics  <cit> . for example, a gfp reporter for the unc- <dig> homeodomain transcription factor gene is expressed in  <dig> motor neurons out of a total  <dig> cells in the mature embryo   <cit> . in vitro, we detected a comparable fraction  of unc-4::gfp cells. moreover, cultured unc-4::gfp cells adopt neuronal-like processes and express molecular markers also seen in vivo   <cit> . on the basis of these results, we have profiled cultured unc-4::gfp neurons with the expectation that this approach will provide a comprehensive picture of genes expressed in these motor neurons in vivo.

we describe methods for isolating unc-4::gfp-labeled neurons by fluorescence activated cell sorting . mrna from these cells is amplified, labeled and hybridized to the c. elegans affymetrix gene chip. a comparison to microarray data derived from all embryonic cells reveals ~ <dig> genes with significantly higher levels of expression in unc-4::gfp neurons. the validity of these data is supported by the inclusion of genes known to be expressed in these neurons in vivo and by the generation of new gfp reporters from previously uncharacterized genes on this list. we conclude that mapcel offers a reliable strategy for profiling gene expression of a specific motor neuron class. using this approach, we have provided, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of gene expression in a subset of c. elegans motor neurons. we expect that mapcel can now be applied to other c. elegans neurons and thereby link specific neuronal fates with unique combinations of differentially expressed genes.

RESULTS
profiling strategy
unc-4::gfp is expressed in  <dig> embryonic motor neurons;  i <dig> ,  sab , and  da    <cit> . although each of the motor neuron classes is morphologically distinct, the da and sab motor neurons, which constitute the majority  of unc-4:gfp neurons, also share several characteristics including common presynaptic inputs, anteriorly directed axonal processes, cholinergic activity, and similar defects in unc- <dig> mutants  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to assume that many of the same genes would be expressed in both of these motor neuron classes and that these could be revealed in microarray experiments.

a schematic of our approach to profile unc-4::gfp cells is presented in fig.  <dig>  c. elegans embryonic cells were cultured for  <dig> hr to allow differentiation of gfp-labeled motor neurons. unc-4::gfp cells are rarely observed in freshly dissociated preparations but constitute about 2% of all cells after  <dig> day in culture. the delayed appearance of unc-4::gfp cells in culture is consistent with the developmental timing of unc-4::gfp expression in vivo; unc-4::gfp motor neurons are normally generated after morphogenesis is initiated  <cit> . these older embryos are not dissociated by our methods  <cit> . fluorescence activated cell sorting  is used to isolate enriched  populations of unc-4::gfp cells. rna is extracted, amplified, and labeled for application to the c. elegans affymetrix gene chip.

unc-4::gfp motor neurons are isolated by facs
it is necessary to plate freshly dissociated embryonic cells on a solid substrate to promote differentiation and to prevent clumping. although c. elegans neurons show extensive morphological differentiation on peanut lectin-coated glass they also adhere avidly and cannot be easily removed. we discovered that cells plated on poly-l-lysine coated surfaces also differentiate but can be readily dissociated from substrate by gentle trituration. a fluorescence profile was established for cells from the non-gfp wildtype strain  to identify autofluorescent intestinal cells. because these cells autofluoresce in both the propidium iodide  and gfp channels, they are largely restricted to the diagonal axis of this scatter plot . pi was added immediately prior to sorting to stain damaged cells . separate experiments with pi-stained wildtype cells and with cells from unc-4::gfp embryos were used to establish sorting gates for pi and gfp-labeled cells, respectively . as shown in fig 2c, viable unc-4::gfp neurons were simultaneously gated by light scattering parameters. this gate was established empirically to achieve ~90% enrichment of unc-4::gfp labeled cells . we typically obtained about  <dig>  unc-4::gfp neurons from each sort. rna from the equivalent of  <dig>  unc-4::gfp neurons was pooled for each separate microarray experiment. we will refer to microarray results from unc-4::gfp marked cells as the "unc-4::gfp motor neuron" data set. reference rna was extracted from all viable cells sorted from a  <dig> hr culture of wildtype embryonic cells. microarray results with this "reference" data set should reflect transcript levels in the average differentiated embryonic cell.

microarray experiments yield reproducible profiles
data obtained from successive hybridizations of two separate arrays with the same labeled probe yielded a coefficient of determination, r <dig> =  <dig>  . this result indicates that potential differences between individual affymetrix arrays or hybridization and scanning procedures are not significant sources of error. the overall concurrence of the experimental  and reference data is illustrated graphically in the scatter plots shown in panels a and b of fig  <dig>  to assess the reproducibility of sample preparation methods , r <dig> was calculated for each pairwise combination of independent samples. an average r <dig> of  <dig>   was calculated for the wildtype  reference samples ; average r <dig> was  <dig>   for the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set . these values are indicative of highly similar samples and thereby show that our methods are reliable.

detecting expressed genes 
differential hybridization to perfect match  vs mismatch  oligo probes on the affymetrix chip was used to identify transcripts reliably detected as "present" in the reference and unc-4::gfp motor neuron data sets . this list was adjusted in two ways for the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set to arrive at a more accurate representation of expressed genes  . in the first instance, transcripts that were statistically downregulated in unc-4::gfp motor neurons relative to the wildtype reference were removed from the "present" list as these are likely to be detected because they are actually highly enriched in contaminating the non-gfp cells  . conversely, we included transcripts that were considered enriched according to our statistical methods but originally scored as "absent" on the basis of pm vs mm signals used by affymetrix mas  <dig>  software . this second adjustment simply acknowledges that enriched transcripts are clearly expressed and therefore should be scored as "present." we refer to the transcripts in these modified lists as egs . a total of  <dig>  egs were detected in the reference data set and  <dig>  egs in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set  . overall  <dig>  unique transcripts were detected in these experiments or about 50% of all predicted c. elegans orfs  <cit>  . these results are comparable to microarray data from whole embryos that also detected about half of the predicted c. elegans genes  <cit> . genes that are not detected may be expressed in a relatively small number of cells. this point is substantiated by our finding that  <dig> egs in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set are not scored as present in the reference data set . for example, the transcription factor unc- <dig> is normally expressed in a small subset of embryonic neurons including the das  <cit> . the unc- <dig> transcript is enriched in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set  but is not detected in the reference . thus, it seems likely that the overall number of egs should increase as additional classes of embryonic cells are profiled .

selected c. elegans genes are enriched in unc- <dig> motor neurons
a majority of transcripts in the reference and unc-4::gfp motor neuron data sets show comparable levels of expression . many of these transcripts are likely to encode core functions required in every cell. other transcripts in this group could be limited to subsets of embryonic cells that include unc- <dig> motor neurons. genes that are widely expressed in neurons, for example, may not be detectably enriched in unc-4::gfp motor neurons in comparison to the reference because neurons constitute a significant fraction  of all cells in the embryo. to illustrate this point, we note that unc- <dig> , an integral component of the neurotransmitter release mechanism and therefore expressed in most neurons  <cit> , is detected in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set but is not enriched .

as graphically illustrated in the scatter plot shown in fig. 3c, subsets of genes in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set are differentially expressed relative to the average expression levels for all cells in the reference data set . as expected for a gene that is selectively expressed in unc-4::gfp neurons, the hybridization signal for the unc- <dig> transcript is highly elevated  in comparison to all cells. significant numbers of genes are also under-expressed in unc- <dig> motor neurons relative to other embryonic cells. transcripts showing ≥  <dig> × fold intensity difference in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron vs reference data sets were defined using sam statistics at a false discovery rate  of ≤ 1%. by these criteria  <dig> genes are enriched  in unc- <dig> motor neurons  whereas  <dig> transcripts are depleted  . the threshold of ≥  <dig> × fold was defined empirically. at higher values  genes with known expression in these cells were excluded   <cit>   whereas, a lower threshold of  <dig> × included significantly more false positives   <cit> .

confirmation of unc- <dig> motor neuron genes
information gleaned from published literature  and from wormbase , identified  <dig> genes with known expression in embryonic motor neurons that also express unc-4::gfp  . we detect  <dig>  of these genes as egs of which  <dig>  are enriched. in addition, a significant number of transcripts encoding core neuronal functions  are detected in the unc-4::gfp data set . for example, in addition to unc- <dig>  other components of the snare complex, snb- <dig>  and snap- <dig>  are detected  <cit> . we also examined the data set for potential false positives by considering transcripts that are known to be highly expressed in other tissues but not in unc- <dig> motor neurons. for example, in the embryo, the homeodomain protein unc- <dig> is exclusively detected in dd motor neurons. expression of the gaba vesicular transporter, unc- <dig>  in dd motor neurons depends on unc- <dig> function  <cit> . unc- <dig> motor neurons are cholinergic and as expected neither of these gaba specific transcripts are present in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set .

the strong representation of ~80% of genes known to be expressed in i <dig>  sab, and da motor neurons in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron dataset indicates that other previously uncharacterized transcripts in this list are also likely to be expressed in these cells in vivo. to test this idea, we evaluated gfp reporter lines for representative genes detected as enriched in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set . as shown in table  <dig>  82%  of these promoter-gfp fusions show expression in unc- <dig> motor neurons in vivo. of the gfp reporters not detected in these neurons, one of them, t19c <dig> , fails to express gfp in any cell. this finding could mean that the upstream sequence selected for this construct does not overlap the endogenous t19c <dig>  gene regulatory region. in some cases, cell-specific expression of c. elegans genes depends on distal upstream regions, intronic sequences, or 3' domains that would not be included in these 5' promoter gfp fusions  <cit> . this explanation could also account for the apparent absence of gfp expression in the unc-4::gfp motor neurons of the nlp- <dig> and nlp- <dig> gfp reporters. the validity of this data set is further substantiated by the observation that gfp expression in da motor neurons is detected even for lower ranking genes . thus, we believe that the transcripts listed in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set are likely to constitute an accurate representation of genes normally expressed in these cells.

we note that the positive gfp reporters shown in table  <dig> are not uniformly detected in unc- <dig> neurons: all but one  are expressed in the das, one in i <dig> and none in the sab motor neurons. this bias reflects the relative abundance of da motor neurons  in the cells used to generate this data set and thus could indicate that most of the enriched transcripts are also expressed in the das. therefore, results presented below are largely focused on potential gene functions in da motor neurons.

families of neuronal genes expressed in unc- <dig> motor neurons
here we describe transcripts detected in the unc-4::gfp dataset with an emphasis on genes that are enriched in these cells and therefore likely to encode proteins with important roles in the differentiation or function of unc- <dig> motor neurons . a comprehensive discussion of gene families from this list can be found in additional file  <dig>  selected examples are presented here. gene names for enriched trancripts discussed in this section are shown in bold and are listed in table  <dig>  all egs are listed in additional file  <dig> 

axon guidance and outgrowth
growth cone steering and cell migration along the dorsal-ventral body axis in c. elegans depend on the unc-6/netrin guidance cue. the unc-40/dcc receptor mediates an attractive response to unc-6/netrin whereas co-expression of unc-40/dcc with a second unc- <dig> receptor, unc- <dig>  results in repulsion  <cit> . the unc-6/netrin signal is released from ventral ectoderm  <cit>  to repel growth cones expressing both unc- <dig> and unc-5; this interaction is required for normal outgrowth of da motor neuron commissures to the dorsal nerve cord  <cit> . as expected, unc- <dig> and unc- <dig> transcripts are enriched in unc- <dig> motor neurons. unc- <dig>  which is known to be expressed in the i <dig> pharyngeal neuron, is also elevated  <cit> . the clr- <dig> receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase  is proposed to inhibit attractive unc-6/netrin responses via interactions with unc- <dig>  in the da motor neurons, clr- <dig> also promotes unc-6/netrin repulsion by an unc-40-independent mechanism  <cit> . as predicted by these models, the clr- <dig> transcript is elevated in unc- <dig> motor neurons. relevant to this point, we note that the c. elegans abelson tyrosine kinase ortholog, abl- <dig>  is also enriched. in drosophila, abl tyrosine kinase antagonizes the axon guidance role of rptps in motor neurons  <cit> . it will be interesting to determine if abl- <dig> functions similarly in c. elegans and, in this case, if abl- <dig> works in opposition to clr- <dig> during da motor axon outgrowth .

we also detected axon guidance effectors unc- <dig> and ced- <dig> in our microarray array dataset. genetic approaches have shown that unc- <dig>  and ced- <dig>  are downstream effectors of unc- <dig> signaling and presumptive links to the cytoskeleton  <cit> .

transcripts for genes with general roles in axon outgrowth are enriched in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set. these include unc- <dig> , unc- <dig>  and unc- <dig> . all three of these genes are highly expressed in the c. elegans nervous system. unc- <dig> encodes multiple alternatively spliced transcripts with broad roles in axonal morphogenesis  <cit> . unc- <dig> and its vertebrate homologs define a new protein class of unknown biochemical function. in c. elegans, unc- <dig> mutants show axon outgrowth and fasciculation defects  <cit> . unc- <dig> and unc- <dig>  mutants display similar neuronal defects with misplaced processes and enlarged abnormal varicosities  <cit> . unc- <dig>  has been proposed to phosphorylate unc- <dig> to regulate vesicular trafficking during axonal process outgrowth  <cit> .

wingless signaling
wingless  signaling controls multiple developmental processes in the nervous system ranging from cell determination to axon guidance and synaptogenesis  <cit> . the c. elegans genome contains  <dig> wnt genes and  <dig> wnt receptors or frizzled homologs  <cit> . one of each, cwn- <dig>  and lin- <dig> , are enriched. transcripts for other components of the canonical  and noncanonical  wnt signaling pathways are detected as egs. thus, unc- <dig> motor neurons are presumptively competent to send as well as respond to wnt signals. functions for wnt signaling in the c. elegans motor neuron circuit have not been defined. possibilities include the regulation of synaptogenesis as suggested by studies of drosophila motor neurons which secrete wnt to control both presynaptic and postsynaptic differentiation at the neuromuscular synapse  <cit> . a gradient of wnt signaling controls cell migration along the ap axis in c. elegans  <cit> . responsiveness to this graded wnt signal could account for the anterior polarity of da motor neurons in the dorsal nerve cord as suggested by the recent finding that commissural axonal polarity along the ap axis in the vertebrate spinal cord is dependent on wnt signaling  <cit> .

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors 
the c. elegans genome encodes at least  <dig> distinct nachr subunits  <cit> . two of these, acr- <dig> and unc- <dig> are expressed in da class motor neurons  <cit>  and are enriched in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set. expression of unc- <dig>  <cit>  and unc- <dig>  in ventral cord motor neurons has been previously reported and these are also detected as egs . acr-12::gfp is expressed in neurons , and we have validated the enrichment of acr- <dig> with gfp reporters that confirm expression in da motor neurons . in body muscle, unc- <dig> is an essential component of a levamisole-sensitive nach receptor that also includes unc- <dig>  unc- <dig>  lev- <dig> and lev- <dig>  <cit> . acr- <dig> may coassemble with unc- <dig>  unc- <dig>  and unc- <dig> to generate a related nach receptor in unc- <dig> motor neurons . five additional sets of nachr subunits are detected as egs and a so-called "orphan" ligand gated ion channel  subunit, f21a <dig> , with significant similarity to the nachr gene family, is enriched. despite the diversity of nachr subunits expressed in unc- <dig> motor neurons and the potentially complex array of resultant receptors, no functions have been directly assigned to nachrs in these cells  <cit> . although loss-of-function mutations in nachr subunits that are also expressed in muscle  result in locomotory defects, gene knockouts of acr- <dig>  and acr- <dig> , which are exclusively expressed in neurons, do not produce obvious effects on motility or behavior. perhaps the surprisingly large number  of nachr subunit genes detected in these cells results in overlapping functions that mask defects in single gene knockout mutants. alternatively, these nachrs may mediate subtle aspects of motor neuron activity. this idea is consistent with models in which nachrs act presynaptically to modulate neurotransmitter release  <cit> . finally, we detect enrichment of transcripts for proteins ric- <dig>  and lev- <dig>  that mediate nachr localization  <cit> .

ligand-gated ion channels
unc- <dig> motor neurons are potentially responsive to additional classes of neurotransmitters. enrichment of glr- <dig>  is correlated with its known expression in the sab motor neurons  <cit> . as members of the gaba/glycine family of ligand-gated receptors, the presumptive anion channels encoded by t27e <dig>  and y71d11a. <dig> are predicted to hyperpolarize unc- <dig> motor neurons and thus inhibit cholinergic activity  <cit> . it may be significant that a candidate sodium/chloride-dependent glycine transporter, snf- <dig>  is enriched.  in mammalian cells, plasma membrane transporters glyt1/glyt <dig> remove glycine from the synaptic cleft, and in the case of glyt <dig>  thereby recycle glycine for reuptake into synaptic vesicles  <cit> . unc- <dig> motor neurons do not express the gaba/glycine vesicular transporter, unc- <dig>  however, and are therefore unlikely to release glycine presynaptically  <cit> . in this case, the physiological function of the snf- <dig> transporter could mirror that of glyt <dig>  which is believed to attenuate glycinergic signaling by pumping glycine into a non-glycinergic glial cell  <cit> . to date, the potential function of glycinergic signaling in c. elegans has not been explored.

g-protein signaling
cholinergic motor neuron activity in c. elegans is modulated by g-protein signaling pathways that respond to the neurotransmitters acetylcholine, serotonin , and dopamine   <cit> . in each case, acetylcholine release is either promoted by egl- <dig>  or inhibited by goa- <dig> . input to these antagonistic pathways is provided by g-protein coupled receptors . pharmacological evidence suggests that a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor activates egl- <dig> to enhance ach release at the neuromuscular synapse  <cit> . the enriched muscarinic achrs, gar- <dig> and gar- <dig> could account for this effect  <cit> . similarly the enriched 5-ht receptor, ser- <dig>  is a strong candidate for the gpcr mediating the inhibitory effect of serotonin on ach release from ventral cord motor neurons  <cit> . dopamine may either activate or inhibit ach release within the same cholinergic motor neuron. activation depends on dop- <dig> which is enriched in unc- <dig> motor neurons. inhibition is attributed to dop- <dig>  expression of dop- <dig> in cholinergic ventral cord motor neurons is reportedly weak and we do not detect the dop- <dig> transcript in our data set  <cit> . unc- <dig> motor neurons are also potentially responsive to gaba as a transcript  encoding a metabotropic gaba type b <dig> receptor is enriched. gaba dependent effects on cholinergic motor neuron activity have not been previously reported in c. elegans.

genetic screens for mutations affecting neurotransmitter release have revealed a complex web of interacting components that couple g-protein signaling to synaptic vesicle fusion   <cit>  . with one exception , transcripts for all of the known components of these pathways are either enriched  or detected as egs . lack of enrichment of some of these components is consistent with the widespread utilization of g-protein signaling pathways in c. elegans neurons and muscle cells  <cit> . as noted above, these data have also revealed several additional enriched transcripts with potential roles in g-protein dependent locomotory behavior. egl- <dig> encodes an orphan gpcr and rgs- <dig> an rgs protein, both of which can regulate goa- <dig> signaling in the egg laying circuit  <cit> . rnai of f39b <dig> , which encodes a highly conserved but unusual protein with both serine/threonine kinase and 7-transmembrane domains, results in a locomotory defect  <cit>  that could be indicative of a neuromodulatory function in da motor neurons. a complete list of g-protein signaling components detected in this dataset can be found in table  <dig> 

neuropeptide signaling
the c. elegans genome includes a large and diverse array of genes encoding potential neuroactive peptides. gfp reporter studies indicate that these genes are predominantly expressed in neurons.  <dig> "flp" genes encoding fmrfamide and related peptides  have been described. farps have been shown to modulate a wide array of invertebrate neural functions  <cit> . previously reported expression of flp- <dig>  flp- <dig>  flp- <dig> in the pharyngeal i <dig> neuron  <cit>   is confirmed by their enrichment in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set . flp- <dig> is also elevated in these cells and  <dig> additional flps are detected as egs . specific farps modulate cell excitability , locomotion  and feeding behavior  in c. elegans  <cit> . the inhibitory action of the flp- <dig> peptide on pharyngeal muscle activity is consistent with its expression in i <dig>  <cit> .

the c. elegans genome contains  <dig> genes encoding predicted insulin-like peptides  <cit> . transcripts for two of these, ins- <dig> and ins- <dig>  are enriched; ins- <dig>  ins- <dig> and ins- <dig> are present but not significantly elevated relative to other cells. ins- <dig> and ins- <dig> have been implicated in the daf- <dig> insulin receptor dependent pathways regulating growth, metabolism and lifespan  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> genes encoding other potential classes of neuropeptides have also been identified in the c. elegans genome. three of these neuropeptide-like protein  genes, nlp- <dig>  nlp- <dig>  and nlp- <dig>  are enriched in unc- <dig> motor neurons . an additional group of  <dig> nlp transcripts are detected as egs . to date, no functions have been directly assigned to nlp genes in c. elegans  <cit> .

our studies have revealed that a surprisingly large number of neuropeptide genes are transcribed in unc- <dig> motor neurons. these results indicate that unc- <dig> motor neurons are likely to exhibit significant neurosecretory activity. this conclusion is consistent with our finding that proteases required for neuropeptide processing and activation  are also expressed in these cells  <cit> . other genes with important roles in neurosecretion are also detected. ric- <dig> encodes a novel arfaptin-related protein that is believed to function in the golgi in the generation of neurosecretory granules and may through this activity and subsequent neuropeptide signaling exert an indirect effect on ach release from conventional synaptic vesicles  <cit> . our finding that ric- <dig> is highly enriched in cholinergic motor neurons could be indicative of autocrine neuropeptide modulation of ach secretion at the neuromuscular synapse. consistent with this idea is our finding that ida- <dig>  a conserved membrane component of the dense core vesicles in which neuropeptides are typically packaged, is an eg  <cit> . finally, unc- <dig> , a known facilitator of dense core vesicular release, is enriched  <cit> . plasma membrane fusion of both dense core vesicles and the small, clear vesicles in which classical neurotransmitters are packaged, depend on a common set of calcium-activated components  <cit>  most of which are either enriched or present in these cells .

in addition to secreting neuropeptides, unc- <dig> motor neurons are also likely to respond to neuropeptide signaling. transcripts for nine putative neuropeptide receptors are enriched. . rnai of two of these, npr- <dig> and f59d <dig> , results in locomotory defects that could be indicative of specific functions in da motor neurons  <cit> . npr- <dig> is a close relative of npr- <dig>  which has been shown to control social feeding behavior in response to the flp- <dig>  peptide  <cit> . f59d <dig>  is most closely related to melatonin receptors but its in vivo ligand is unknown. neuropeptides are believed to modulate secretion of classical neurotransmitters  <cit> . neuropeptide specific effects on excitatory motor neuron activity in the ascaris ventral nerve cord have been reported  <cit> . genetic evidence in c. elegans indicates that acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction is enhanced by neuropeptide activity  <cit>  and that this pathway depends on the egl- <dig> gqα protein  <cit>  . these neuropeptides may be released from neurons and also as a retrograde signal from muscle cells  <cit> .

other classes of enriched transcripts are discussed in additional file  <dig> .

discussion
we have described mapcel, a microarray-based strategy for fingerprinting specific c. elegans neurons, and provide evidence that this approach can reveal a comprehensive picture of gene expression in these cells in vivo. unc-4::gfp-marked neurons were isolated by facs from primary cultures of embryonic cells and profiled on the c. elegans affymetrix gene chip. because these unc-4::gfp neurons differentiate in vitro, it was important to establish that our microarray data provide an accurate representation of gene expression in the intact animal. this conclusion is supported by three observations:  a majority  of genes with known expression in unc-4::gfp neurons are detected in our microarray data set;  ~80%  of gfp reporters constructed for transcripts enriched in unc- <dig> motor neurons are expressed in these cells in vivo ;  transcripts known to encode proteins with key roles in unc-4::gfp motor neuron differentiation  and function  are highly represented in our data sets. these findings parallel earlier studies showing that cultured c. elegans neurons and muscle cells adopt apparently normal morphological and physiological characteristics  <cit>  and are consistent with evidence favoring a cell autonomous mode of differentiation for c. elegans embryonic cells after an initial phase of inductive signaling events  <cit> . we have now generated comparable microarray profiles of other motor neuron classes and muscle cells that also show strong congruence with known patterns of gene expression . we therefore conclude that our approach of profiling gfp marked neurons isolated from primary culture can now be widely applied to fingerprint specific c. elegans embryonic cells. in some cases, however, differentiation of a given neuron is likely to depend on specific intercellular signals that primary cultures will not provide. thus, in every instance, it will be necessary to confirm microarray data by independent methods as described here.

methods for profiling specific c. elegans cells
previous studies have described other methods for cataloging transcripts from specific c. elegans cells. comparisons of microarray data from mutant animals with either supernumerary or absent sensory neurons in the male tail, have revealed genes that are preferentially expressed in these cells  <cit> . however this approach is limited to cell types that can be manipulated by specific mutants. in addition, this method may be insufficiently sensitive to detect changes in smaller subsets of cells due to high background mrna from cells that are not affected by the mutation . this limitation can be overcome by enriching for mrna from target cells. to this end, zhang et al.  used an approach similar to the strategy outlined in this paper to identify downstream genes of the mec- <dig> transcription factor in c. elegans touch neurons  <cit> . however, this work did not provide a comprehensive cell-specific gene expression profile as we have here perhaps due to the limited enrichment  of gfp-labeled touch neurons. we have now optimized the application of nematode embryonic cell culture and facs technology to obtain ~90% enrichment of gfp-marked neurons and muscle cells  . these methods have now been successfully applied to profile other classes of c. elegans embryonic cells  <cit> .

mapcel cannot be used for postembryonic cells because these apparently do not arise in culture  <cit> . microarray profiles of specific larval cells have been obtained, however, by mrna tagging. in this approach, an epitope-labeled polya binding protein  is expressed transgenically under the control of a cell-specific promoter and mrnas isolated by co-immunoprecipitation with anti-flag. this method has been used for microarray analysis of c. elegans body muscle cells and ciliated sensory neurons  <cit> . we have now successfully used the mrna tagging strategy to profile specific subsets of motor neurons from c. elegans larvae . thus, in principle, it should now be possible to obtain an accurate gene expression profile for virtually any c. elegans cell throughout development.

unc- <dig> motor neurons are sensitive to a wide range of neurotransmitters and peptidergic signals
acetylcholine  release at the da neuromuscular junction is presumptively triggered by excitatory input from command interneurons. the strength of the da cholinergic signal, however, may be strongly modulated by other cells that release neurotransmitters from distal locations. for example, dopamine is produced by  <dig> neurons, none of which are presynaptic to da motor neurons  <cit> . dopamine, however, is a potent regulator of cholinergic secretory activity in the ventral motor circuit. the dopamine effect is mediated in part by dop- <dig>  a g-protein coupled receptor   <cit> . we have confirmed enrichment of the dop- <dig> transcript and also detected elevated levels of transcripts encoding gpcrs for acetylcholine and serotonin, additional neurotransmitters known to modulate cholinergic motor neuron activity via g-protein signaling pathways  <cit> . enrichment of a gaba metabotropic receptor transcript offers yet another mechanism for exogenous adjustment of neurotransmitter vesicular fusion in da motor neurons. indirect evidence indicates that acetylcholine release from ventral cord motor neurons may also be sensitive to neuropeptide signals from other neurons or muscle cells  <cit> . we have established that unc-4::gfp motor neurons express elevated transcript levels for nine different gpcrs with significant homology to insect or mammalian neuropeptide receptors. this signaling complexity is further compounded by the enrichment of transcripts for  <dig> members of the serpentine gpcr-like family in unc-4::gfp neurons . ligands for this outlier group of gpcrs are unknown  <cit> . the picture emerging from these data is of a motor neuron festooned with multiple g-protein linked receptors each responding to a different class of neurotransmitter or peptidergic signal . in effect, these motor neurons are also functioning as a kind of sensory neuron in which disparate inputs are internally assessed to fine-tune output in concert with temporal requirements for locomotory activity.

the microarray data also reveal multiple additional classes of receptors and ion channels through which the differentiation and function of unc-4::gfp motor neurons could be modulated by extracellular signals . finally, we have detected enrichment of transcripts encoding tgf-β, wingless, and several classes of neuropeptides . thus, in addition to responding to a wide range of stimuli, unc-4::gfp motor neurons are also potentially capable of regulating the activities of other cells with a variety of different signals. if an organism as simple as c. elegans builds motor neurons with such sophisticated signaling and response mechanisms, it is tempting to speculate that neurons in other, more advanced species may have evolved even more complex pathways. it is likely, however, that the core signaling systems described here are also conserved. this prediction is underscored by our finding that approximately half of the enriched transcripts  and 2/ <dig> of egs  detected in unc-4::gfp neurons have human homologs  .

in addition to confirming expression of genes with known roles in unc-4::gfp motor neuron differentiation and function, the microarray data also uncovered strong candidates for new genes governing these events. for example, da motor axons grow dorsally in response to a ventrally provided repulsive unc-6/netrin guidance cue  <cit> . recent work has shown that the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase , clr- <dig>  positively enhances this response  <cit> . as expected, we found that the clr- <dig> transcript is enriched in the unc-4::gfp motor neuron data set. we also noted enrichment of abl- <dig>  the c. elegans homolog of abelson tyrosine kinase. by analogy to findings in drosophila in which abelson tyrosine kinase functions in opposition to rptp-dependent axon guidance  <cit> , we propose that abl- <dig> antagonizes clr- <dig> activity . this model predicts that either genetic ablation or rnai of abl- <dig> will suppress the da motor axon guidance defects of clr- <dig> mutants.

another application of this strategy includes the identification of transcription factor target genes. a comparison of expression fingerprints of wildtype cells vs cells that are mutant for a specific transcription factor could reveal downstream genes  <cit> . for example, the unc- <dig> transcription factor regulates axon morphology and synaptic strength in embryonically derived unc-4::gfp neurons  <cit> . unc- <dig> also defines the specificity of synaptic inputs to postembryonically-derived va motor neurons  <cit> . we have now used a combination of mapcel and mrna tagging strategies to identify candidate genes regulated by unc- <dig> in these cells . gene regulatory motifs to which transcription factors bind may also be revealed as common cis-acting sequences in cohorts of co-regulated genes  <cit> .

the c. elegans nervous system is composed of exactly  <dig> neurons. the morphology and connectivity for every neuron has been defined by serial section electron microscopy to generate a detailed wiring diagram for the entire network  <cit> . the c. elegans genome is similarly well defined. all  <dig> chromosomes are completely sequenced and the structure of over  <dig>  genes described  <cit> . unique combinations of these genes are likely to specify different classes of neurons and their differentiated traits. the problem now is to link the gene map with the wiring diagram. we believe that mapcel offers a powerful approach toward achieving this goal.

CONCLUSIONS
we have described a new method, micro-array profiling of c. elegans cells, or mapcel, for generating gene expression fingerprints of subsets of c. elegans neurons. embryonic motor neurons marked with a reporter gene, unc-4::gfp, were isolated by facs from primary cultures and profiled on the c. elegans affymetrix array. we confirmed that microarray data generated by this approach reliably identify genes expressed by these motor neurons in vivo. we propose that mapcel can now be used to generate a gene expression map for the c. elegans nervous system.
