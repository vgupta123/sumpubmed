BACKGROUND
natural antisense transcripts  are endogenous ones that exhibit complementary sequences to transcripts of a known function, or sense transcripts. nats were first described in prokaryotes  <cit> , and they were found to down-regulate the expression of sense transcripts involved in diverse biological functions, such as transposition, plasmid replication and gene expression  <cit> . since the discovery of first nat in human  <cit> , an increasing number of nats in mammalian organisms have been reported to be related to genomic imprinting  <cit> , rna interference  <cit> , alternative splicing  <cit> , x-inactivation  <cit>  and rna editing  <cit> . it has been shown that nats could perform two non-exclusive major functions: template for translation and regulation of sense gene expression, and the latter may occur at the level of transcription, maturation, transport, stability and/or translation  <cit> .

as nats seemed to exist so extensively, independent genome-wide searches for potential nats were performed recently with data from refseq, unigene or some specially constructed est database. due to differences in data sources and/or criteria used in searches, the number of reported human nats  varies greatly, from hundreds  <cit>  to thousands  <cit> .

there are two different types of nats, cis and trans. a cis nat is transcribed from the opposite strand of the same genomic locus as its sense rna, thus the pair displays perfect sequence complementarity. in contrast, a trans nat is transcribed from a genomic locus different from its sense counterpart and the pair may display imperfect complementarity  <cit> . all early works in human, mouse, and drosophila revealed only cis nats  <cit> . although increasing evidence suggests that trans nats might perform more significant and versatile functions than previously expected  <cit> , most of the high-throughput searches were focused on cis nats but overlooked trans ones  <cit> . the bias towards cis type also existed in kiyosawa et al's survey on mouse genome  <cit> . lehner et al.  <cit>  investigated both cis and trans nats based on available mrnas, and found  <dig> human nats including  <dig> putative trans ones. however, we believe that they underestimated the prevalence of hnats since many known antisense rnas are non-protein coding.

in this work, we carried out a thorough in silico analysis of human rna sequences from the refseq database  <cit>  and identified  <dig> hnats, among which  <dig> nats were reported for the first time. out of the  <dig> novel nats that have genomic mapping data available, we determined that  <dig> are trans nats. we also classified the  <dig> nats according to pairing regions and found that 87% cases involved utr sequences of one or both transcripts. we noticed that among a total of  <dig> nat pairs related with splice variants,  <dig> %  have their pairing regions affected or completely eliminated by alternative splicing, suggesting significant relationship of alternative splicing and antisense-directed regulation. we proposed that the one-to-many relationship of sense and antisense transcript pairs, caused by the extensive occurrence of splice variants in hnats and other multiple pairing patterns, may lead to a probable regulatory network. furthermore, using stanford microarray database   <cit> , we found two hnat pairs displaying a significant inverse expression pattern before and after insulin injection.

RESULTS
identification of hnats from refseq with blastn
previous large-scale hnats searches have significantly expanded our knowledge about the prevalence of hnat  <cit> . particularly, chen et al.  <cit>  predicted that about 20% of the human genes formed sense-antisense transcript pairs.

in this work, we studied hnats with refseq  <cit> , which is a manually curated database that collects comprehensive, non-redundant sets of sequences, and identified  <dig> hnats including both cis and trans types . although we found limited hnats compared to previous reports, sequence accession number matching showed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> nat pairs did not appear in any of the published data sets  <cit> , indicating that antisense regulation may be even more widespread in the mammalian genome than appreciated previously.

the reason that previous studies did not find these entries might be due to different starting data and/or the criteria used. most of these studies identified nats based on genomic locus overlapping. as a result, they tend to find cis nats, but overlooked trans ones  <cit> . for example, yelin et al.  <cit>  mainly collected sequences that span intron from human expressed sequences ), and predicted  <dig> % of human transcription clusters formed cis nat pairs. similarly, chen et al.  <cit>  investigated sense-orientation-reliable ests from unigene, and got the largest cis hnats data set reported to date. non-polyadenylated transcripts were not included in their study, which may partly explain why they did not find the novel cis pairs in this work. we did not exclude the possibility that some of the novel cis pairs in this paper were actually included in chen et al.'s results  <cit>  since our comparison was based on accession number only and there are cases that a sequence entry acquires a different primary accession number in following releases due to sequence split or merge. lehner et al.  <cit>  identified both trans and cis hnats, but they only considered mrna, and ignored non-coding rna which occurs in many known functional nat examples. moreover, the newer version of refseq database that we used in this work contains nearly twice as many entries of human mrna  as that in the previous version  used by lehner et al.  <cit> . as a result, we were able to identify more novel hnats, particularly trans type nats. the  <dig> hnats are summarized in table  <dig>  out of the  <dig> entries,  <dig> have genomic mapping data available in the genome database. thus we determined that  <dig> nats are cis type and  <dig> are trans type . one hundred and fifty seven out of the  <dig> trans nats were reported for the first time. the breadth and importance of trans nats-directed gene regulation are coming into focus as more trans encoded nats, particularly small nucleolar rnas  and micro rnas , are discovered  <cit> . to date, underlying mechanisms of trans nats are relatively less understood than cis ones. the identification of more novel trans nats in this work may shed some light on this field.

it is noticeable that lehner et al. concluded that  <dig> out of their  <dig> trans hnats were likely to be chimeric mrna containing sequences from two different chromosomal loci due to artifacts of cdna library construction and chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . however, after carefully checking the trans hnats they reported, we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> refseq trans hnat pairs thought to be involving suspected chimeras can now be mapped to certain loci, thus are true trans nats. among these  <dig> nats, the chromosomal location information of  <dig> entries was modified in the genome database, suggesting that the presence of trans nats did affect the genome assembly and gene localization as people worried about. it seems that the temporal unfinished human genome assembly was a major obstacle in their survey on trans hnats.

our data do not cover all of previously reported ones  <cit> . this is due to our choice of using the refseq database and the stringent criteria for blastn . refseq includes both mrnas and non-mrnas, but it has a bias towards mrna because of the convenience of identifying mrna. there are  <dig> human mrna and  <dig> human non-mrna entries in the release of refseq we used. thus, our choice of using refseq helped to find coding antisense rnas, while underestimated the non-coding antisense rnas. for example, the first reported hnat over the c-myc locus, a non-coding antisense transcript, cannot be found in our result  <cit> .

eighteen out of the  <dig>  hnat pairs we found involved non-coding rnas, which is significantly higher than the expected  <dig> %, assuming no bias for mrna or non-mrna to form nat pairs. the expected value is estimated as 1â€“ <dig> %* <dig> %, where  <dig> % is the percentage of mrna entries in the starting dataset. this indicates that nats tend to be non-coding rnas, supporting chen et al.'s observations  <cit> , while disagreeing with lehner et al.'s assumption  <cit> . as new non-coding rnas are being discovered, we believe that the number of reported nat pairs will rise further.

even though coding transcripts have fewer propensities to form nat pairs in contrast to non-coding ones, they have been recently reported more frequently than before  <cit> . since coding nats function as both template and regulator, they may lead to more complex gene regulation, as the thra  and nr1d <dig>  nat pair example demonstrates below.

classification of hnats based on the pairing region
assuming that the complementarity of sense and antisense rna pair is the major basis of the regulation function of antisense rnas  <cit> , we analyzed the overlapping length and location of these  <dig> hnats. it was found that overlapping lengths varied from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp , similar to previously reported  <cit> . we classified the  <dig> hnat pairs that have cds location data into  <dig> types according to the pairing region: 1) 5'utr vs. 5'utr, 2) 5'utr vs. cds, 3) 5'utr vs. 3'utr, 4) cds vs. cds, 5) cds vs. 3'utr, 6) 3'utr vs. 3'utr . more than 87% of the  <dig> nat pairs involved 5' or 3' utr, that is, types  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  supporting the significance of utr in antisense-mediated regulation  <cit> .

according to our data, the subtype 6-cis, or 3'utr vs. 3'utr-cis, is the most common form of overlapping. while, analysis of adjacent gene sets in s. cerevisiae suggested that there might be evolutionary pressure to select against convergent genes  <cit> , and the overlapping arrangement of convergent genes restricted the elongation of both transcripts, resulting in a severe reduction in mrna accumulation, termed as transcriptional collision  <cit> . this collision effect could be a direct physical impediment to the transcription machinery or an indirect effect caused by supercoiling changes to the dna template during transcription, while seemed unrelated with interference of antisense rnas  <cit> . the precise biological implication of the convergent arrangement of genes in yeast and mammalian genomes remain to be elucidated. the 6-cis dataset including  <dig> hnat pairs might provide basis for future in-depth investigation.

the subtype 1-cis, or 5'utr vs. 5'utr-cis nat pairs, could be involved in bidirectional transcription driven by a divergent promoter, which seems to be a preferred structure in prokaryotes for gene regulation such as transcription coupling  <cit> . transcription coupling is different from the traditional concept of antisense phenomena, and the choice between transcription coupling and antisense transcript-directed inhibition may depend on the overlapping length and involved transcription factor binding sites. since bi-directional transcription in eukaryotes is not as common as in prokaryotes, the precise organization and its significance of the  <dig> members of type 1-cis are intriguing. an in-depth analysis is still in progress.

splice variants involved in hnats
since the wide existence of alternative splicing has been well established  <cit> , and there is evidence for the involvement of nats in alternative splicing  <cit> , we also investigated the splice variants involved in hnats. in the present  <dig> nats pairs,  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> nat pairs have splice variants . forty-nine of the  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> pairs have pairing regions unaffected by alternative splicing; while the other  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> pairs have variable pairing regions due to alternative splicing. as an example for the latter case, the spag <dig> gene has two splice variants, nm_ <dig> and nm_ <dig>  and they may pair with antisense transcript npr <dig> with  <dig> bp overlap of 99% identity, and  <dig> bp overlap of 100% identity, respectively. it is conceivable that alternative splicing can also make the whole pairing region lost. in case of the il18bp gene , it has four splice variants, but only three of them have antisense transcript numa <dig>  to see how frequently this can happen, we checked the rest  <dig> hnat pairs  using aceview  <cit>  and found that additional  <dig> nat pairs involved splicing variants . in these cases, only one of the transcript variants pairs with its countertranscript while the others lose the pairing region because of alternative splicing. therefore these cases were not contained in additional table 2a. among the  <dig> nat pairs  related with splice variants,  <dig> %  have splicing variants sharing the same pairing region,  <dig> %  have their pairing regions affected or completely eliminated by alternative splicing. the remarkably high percentage of the latter suggested significant relationship of alternative splicing and antisense-directed regulation. taking the thra  and nr1d <dig>  pair  as an example, the sense transcript c-erbaÎ± encodes two structurally related proteins r-erbaÎ± <dig> and r-erbaÎ± <dig> by alternative splicing  <cit> . the antisense rev-erbaÎ± transcript is complementary to the last exon of r-erbaÎ± <dig> mrna but not to the r-erbaÎ± <dig> mrna. it was indicated that rev-erbaÎ± messenger prevents sense r-erbaÎ± primary transcript splicing into r-erbaÎ± <dig> mrna by rna masking, thus tilting the balance towards r-erbaÎ± <dig> synthesis and ultimately modulating cellular response to hormone  <cit> . the inhibition of splicing by nat complementary to sequences remote from the splice site is specific and efficient, which might be attributed to blocking of regulatory elements within the exon essential for exon selection and intron removal, disruption of pre-mrna secondary structure important for splicing, or disruption of rnp structure required for assembly of a functional rna-splicing complex  <cit> . as a result, nat dictates the way how a sense transcript is differentially spliced. a further analysis of the  <dig> nats pairs involving splicing variants with different overlaps may help uncover underlying mechanisms.

also in the above example, the antisense transcript encodes protein rev-erbaÎ±  which happens to belong to the thyroid/steroid hormone receptor family, same as products of sense transcripts  <cit> . this example illustrates the dual roles of some nats: template for translation and regulator of sense gene expression. such a gene structure is quite exquisite and economic to organize functionally related genes.

one-to-many relationship in hnats
initially, nat pairs were considered to have one-to-one relationship. however, an antisense transcript might form duplex with more than one splice variants of a sense gene, as the examples given in previous section. in theory, an antisense transcript has also the potential to pair with more than one paralogous sense transcripts. finally, more than one antisense transcripts may pair with one sense transcript at different parts of its sequence. in the  <dig> hnat pairs, besides the  <dig> entries that form one-to-many relationship caused by alternative splicing, additional  <dig> hnat pairs were found to have one-to-many relationship due to different pairing regions. that makes 47% /568) of the total, allowing nats to form complex regulation networks. figure  <dig> is an example of such a network including  <dig> genes involved in  <dig> hnats. interestingly, all hnat pairs with genomic mapping data are trans type. in fact, hnat pairs in this paper formed  <dig> such networks in various sizes . it is worth noting that these networks mainly involve trans nats, same as the example in figure  <dig>  the trans relationship seems more flexible, thus provides greater chance for transcripts to "communicate" with each other. in addition to rna masking mentioned above, there is now strong evidence that the interaction of antisense partners can also affect gene expression via the activation of dsrna-dependent pathways  <cit> . these might include rna interference -dependent gene silencing. it was reported that several different micro rnas could regulate the expression of the same target mrna based on complementarity between micro rna and mrna  <cit> . it seems that the one-to-many relationship, notably in transcriptional regulation, might be common as the list of known one-to-many regulatory interactions becomes more comprehensive. from this perspective, the biological significance of trans nats deserves to be further investigated systematically.

identification of two hnat pairs with inverse expression pattern
there have been reports that sense and antisense transcripts show inverse expression pattern, as well as examples of coordinated regulation of both transcripts  <cit> . it is more intriguing that sense and antisense transcripts are differentially expressed depending on tissue types or development stages  <cit> . all these phenomena illustrated that the underlying mechanism is complicated and confusing. in this work we focused on identifying inverse expression pattern under certain condition for the hnat pairs we found, considering that this pattern is the most common one for sense-antisense expression.

microarray is a high-throughput technology for analyzing gene expression and has been recently applied to study nats  <cit> . in this work, we used data from smd  <cit>  for in silico expression analysis of the hnats we found. rome et al.  <cit> designed a microarray of  <dig> cdna probes to evaluate gene expression pattern of skeletal muscle cells from six independent volunteers before and after insulin injection. we found that  <dig> out of the  <dig> nats reported in this work had representing probes in the array, so we selected the expression data of  <dig> nats with no less than  <dig> repeat samples for analysis. t-test and multiplicity adjustment showed that relative quantity  values of two nat pairs, sarm1/mgc <dig>  and hars/wdr <dig> , varied significantly after insulin injection, showing the two pairs displayed inverse expression pattern. the calculation result is presented in additional table  <dig> 

for the sarm1/mgc <dig> pair, rq value rose after insulin injection, indicating sarm <dig> is relatively up-regulated in contrast to mgc <dig>  sarm <dig> mrna encodes a conserved protein with a sam motif and is highly expressed in liver and kidney  <cit> . it was reported that a  <dig>  kb antisense transcript was coordinately expressed with the sarm <dig> gene, but this is apparently not the same nat as we found  <cit> , suggesting that the sarm <dig> gene has at least two antisense partners. mgc <dig> is an experimentally supported full-length mrna  with a predicted coding sequence. according to the pairing data, sarm <dig> mrna and mgc <dig> mrna possibly form a cds vs. 3'utr cis nat pair.

for the second pair, hars/wdr <dig>  the relative quantity decreased after insulin injection, indicating hars is down-regulated relative to wdr <dig>  hars mrna codes for histidyl-trna synthetase, which is essential for the incorporation of histidine into proteins  <cit> . the wdr <dig> cdna was cloned recently  <cit> , and has not yet been subjected to final review in the latest release of ncbi refseq database. based on the chromosomal location information, the two genes are mapped closely , but do not overlap. they may form a 3' utr vs. 3' utr trans nat pair. this is a novel pair that we reported for the first time.

the apparent inverse expression pattern of the above two hnat pairs suggests their possible regulatory roles in skeletal muscle cells after insulin injection. further experimental studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
through a systematic analysis of hnats using refseq dataset, we identified  <dig> hnats. even though the total number is less than those reported by yelin et al.  <cit>  and chen et al.  <cit> , many novel hnats, particularly trans nats, were discovered in this work. among the nat pairs involving splice variants, a remarkably high percentage  have their pairing regions affected or completely eliminated by alternative splicing, suggesting significant relationship of alternative splicing and antisense-directed regulation. the extensive occurrence of splice variants in hnats and other multiple pairing patterns results in one-to-many relationship, allowing the formation of complex regulation networks. it seemed that trans nats bring more flexibility and complexity to antisense-directed gene regulation. furthermore, out of the  <dig> hnats with expression data available, we found that the expression pattern of two nat pairs in the skeletal muscle cells showed significant inverse relationship before and after insulin injection.

in summary, nats might carry out more extensive and complex functions than previously thought. combined with endogenous micro rnas, hnats could be regarded as a special group of transcripts contributing to the complex regulation networks.
