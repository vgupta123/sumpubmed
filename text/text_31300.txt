BACKGROUND
controlling the alcoholic fermentation rate of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a key issue for various industrial processes such as wine making, brewing and industrial alcohol production. the glycolytic-fermentation pathway is an essential metabolic process that is linked to the availability of enzyme cofactors, such as nadh/nadph  <cit>  or vitamins, especially thiamine pyrophosphate . this vitamin is involved in pyruvate decarboxylation to acetaldehyde.

glycolytic flux can occur at various intensities depending on strains  <cit>  and environmental conditions. in the wine making process, thiamine levels play a critical role in the outcome of fermentation and a lack of thiamine causes sluggish or stuck fermentation  <cit> . grape musts can contain different amounts of thiamine  depending on grape varieties, agricultural practices and grape processing methods  <cit> . as a result, the addition of thiamine to musts is a common practice in many cellars. yeasts actively incorporate this vitamin at the beginning of wine fermentation and no thiamine is left in the medium after six hours  <cit> . however, s. cerevisiae is also able to synthesize thiamine de novo from hydroxy-ethylthiazole  and hydroxy-methylpyrimidine . nine genes are directly involved in thiamine synthesis: thi <dig> , cysteine and glycine), thi5/11/12/ <dig>  and histidine), thi20/ <dig> , thi <dig>  and thi <dig> . the expression of these genes requires a high degree of coordination and regulation so that cells can adapt according to thiamine availability. cellular content of thiamine is sensed by the association of three proteins: thi2p, thi3p and pdc2p, which controls the expression of genes in the thiamine biosynthetic pathway  <cit> . when the intracellular thiamine level is low, the free form of thi3p associates with thi2p and pdc2p, and the resulting complex activates the transcription by binding to the thi gene promoters  <cit> . pdc2p is also known to independently activate the expression of the two pyruvate decarboxylase pdc <dig> and pdc <dig> <cit> . while pdc <dig> expression is reportedly not controlled by thiamine level, pdc <dig> expression is activated during thiamine deficiency by an unknown mechanism  <cit> .

activation of thi genes expression has been reported at the end of the growth phase in fermentation, where a decrease in thiamine concentration allows an activation of the pathway. the thi genes were shown to be highly expressed throughout the stationary phase until the end of the process. this is in accordance with a high requirement for thiamine in yeast metabolism  <cit> . additionally, enzymatic catalysis has been shown to slowly dismantle the thiamine cofactor as demonstrated with the escherichia coli acetohydroxyacid synthase and zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase  <cit> .

there is considerable variation in the ability of yeast to ferment wine as illustrated by the phenotyping of 72 s. cerevisiae strains  <cit> . some of these differences may arise from modifications in glycolytic enzymes/flux and the availability of cofactors such as thiamine. variations in the expression of genes involved in thiamine metabolism were observed between the lab strain s288c and the wine strains derivative 59a, which is a sequenced haploid descendent of the strain ec <dig>  strain 59a demonstrated stronger expression of thi genes and pdc <dig>  but weaker expression of pdc <dig> than the lab strain . uncovering the genetic variations responsible for the different levels of gene expression would enhance our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved.

in yeast, quantitative trait locus  analyses are now widely used to highlight the allelic effects on phenotypes . variation in regulatory networks have been studied by using both transcriptomic analyses and genetic approaches  <cit> . we previously carried out a linkage analysis of yeast genes expression under wine alcoholic fermentation conditions  <cit> . this analysis combined transcriptomic data and phenotype measurements  of a segregating population from the wine derivative strain  and strain s288c. we searched for expression qtls  and identified  <dig> eqtls linkages   <cit> .

in this work, a small eqtl hotspot on chromosome  <dig> was associated with thiamine metabolism without further analysis. here, we explore variation in this regulatory network. seven genes involved in thiamine metabolism have a linkage in the hotspot, which maps to the position of thi <dig>  surprisingly, the expression of the major pyruvate decarboxylase encoding gene, pdc <dig>  is also impacted by this locus. however, variations in the expression of other thi genes were found to be controlled by other factors. we also suspect that variation in expression of the thiamine transporter, thi <dig>  is linked to a mutation in its promoter. for the other thi genes, we observed a strong correlation between expression and fermentation rate.

RESULTS
mapping of expression qtls over thi3location
our previous study concerning the genetic analysis of expression variations during wine fermentation, in synthetic must  <cit>  revealed a hotspot of  <dig> eqtls that mapped to the position  <dig> kbp on chromosome  <dig>  the genes displaying an eqtl at this locus are listed in table  <dig> and the distribution of their expression in the population of segregants is shown in figure 1a. several of these genes are involved in thiamine metabolism including thiamine biosynthesis  and thiamine mitochondrial transport , or regulated by thiamine level and have a putative role in thiamine metabolism   <cit> . the gene tpn <dig>  which also displays an eqtl at this region, encodes a plasma membrane transporter of pyridoxine, a thiamine precursor  <cit> . in addition, two other genes are controlled by this locus: the aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, aad <dig> <cit> , and the major pyruvate decarboxylase, pdc <dig>  the four homologous genes thi <dig>  thi <dig>  thi <dig> and thi <dig> are involved in the synthesis of the thiamine precursor hydroxy-methylpyrimidine . thi <dig> is absent in the wine derivative strain 59a and was not considered here. the other three genes are identical and could not be dissociated in array transcriptomic analysis given their cross-hybridization, thus they must be considered as a single response.table  <dig>

the qtl region contains thi <dig> encoding the thiamine sensor which activates the expression of genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis during thiamine deficiency. the synthetic must provided an excess of thiamine, allowing for cell growth, but it was previously shown that the genes for thiamin synthesis are expressed during the stationary phase of the fermentation  <cit> . examination of 59a thi <dig> sequence compared to s288c revealed several single nucleotide polymorphisms , of which three are non synonymous . we also observed an insertion of one adenosine in a polya chain in the c terminal region, causing a frame-shift that altered the protein from amino-acid  <dig> to the stop codon . the s288c thi3p sequence is  <dig> amino-acids long whereas the 59a version contains  <dig> amino-acids. we compared the thi <dig> sequences of the published genomes from the sanger institute  <cit>  or in genbank. most s. cerevisae strains possess the thi <dig> allele found in strain 59a, whereas strain s288c and other lab strains  possess the  <dig> amino-acids version. s. paradoxus thi <dig> sequence display the same number of adenine as 59a and most of s. cerevisae strain, suggesting that this version corresponds to the ancestral form of the gene . the frame-shift at amino-acid  <dig> in strain s288c may be the cause of the reduced thi3p function. these mutations are located outside of a proposed thiamine fixation domain , however they are in a region that might encompass an interacting domain with one of the two transcription factors thi2p or pdc2p. the alteration of thi3p in strain s288c may therefore explain the change in thi gene expression and the generation of the eqtls hotspot found in our data.

the detection of the thi <dig> eqtl and the impact of the thi <dig> allele on its expression are displayed on figure 1b. this illustrates the positive effect of the 59a allele of thi <dig> on the expression of the genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis. in contrast, pdc <dig> displays an inverse relationship with the thi <dig> allele , its expression being higher in s288c, indicating that the alteration of thi <dig> in this strain has a positive impact on pdc <dig> transcription. the high lod score of the pdc <dig> eqtl  suggests that thi <dig> allelic variation has an important role in the change of pdc <dig> expression. while the thi <dig> allele in s288c reduces thi <dig> expression, it enhances that of pdc <dig>  our data support the notion that thi <dig> negatively impacts pdc <dig> expression and the form of thi3p in s288c is less functional.

expression variation of other thi genes independent of thi3
however, as only some of the thi genes are controlled by thi <dig> allele, we investigated whether the other thiamine biosynthetic genes displayed linkage to other loci. we did not find any instances of linkage, but instead observed that the expression of most of the genes was correlated with the fermentation rate ). in our previous analysis  <cit> , among the  <dig> transcripts positively correlated to r <dig>  four were involved in thiamine metabolism . we found that the secondary pyruvate decarboxylase gene, pdc <dig>  was also one of the genes whose expression strongly correlated with r <dig> . interestingly, this enzyme is highly expressed when there is a deficiency of thiamine  <cit> . therefore, a tight control of this set of genes by fermentation rate/glycolytic flux may have masked putative linkages to the thi <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

we performed a principal component analysis of the population of segregants in order to observe the relationship between expression levels of the genes involved. we used the expression of selected thi genes, of the pyruvate decaboxylase genes  and of other genes involved , as well as the r <dig> as variables. the results, displayed in figure 2b, confirmed that the expression levels are affected by two main factors: fermentation rate and the allelic origin of the thi <dig> 

examination of the eqtls involving other pdc or thi genes revealed two local cis-regulations as illustrated in figure  <dig>  the transcription factor pdc <dig> displays a cis-eqtl  but no other gene controlled by pdc <dig> displays an eqtl mapping over pdc <dig>  meaning that variation in pdc <dig> expression level has no major impact on its targets. the pdc <dig> allele from s288c is more highly expressed than that of the 59a one; it displays three non-synonymous snps in its coding sequence but no snp in its promoter region, which is consistent with self regulation of its expression.figure  <dig>

the expression of the thiamine membrane transporter thi <dig>  also displays a cis-eqtl . expression of the lab allele of thi <dig> is higher that in the wine yeast. we consistently observed six non-synonymous snps in the 59a gene coding sequence and four snps in the promoter region. a second lod peak corresponding to the position of thi <dig>  and the principal component analysis indicate that the thi <dig> allele may also have some influence on thi <dig> expression. there is indeed an additive effect of the allelic versions of thi <dig> and thi <dig> origin .figure  <dig>

functional assessment of the impact of the thi3allelic form on pdc and thi gene expression
to confirm the role of thi <dig> variation in the control of expression variation of pdc <dig> and thi11/12/ <dig>  an allelic switch of thi <dig> was performed in the 59a background, leading to the introduction of the thi <dig> gene from s288c . we also carried out the deletion of thi <dig> in 59a strain, resulting in a 59a thi3Δ strain, which is auxotrophic for thiamine. to assess the impact on expression, we performed fermentation using the three strains  in a synthetic must  medium at 24°c, as previously used for the qtl analysis. the transcription levels at 70% of the fermentation progress were measured by qpcr analysis for three involved genes: thi <dig>  pdc <dig> and pdc <dig> .

the qpcr results are shown in figure  <dig>  the s288c version of thi <dig>  was associated with an approximately  <dig>  log reduction in thi <dig> expression. this is consistent with the s288c form of thi3p having a lower efficiency in thi genes activation. this result confirms that thi <dig> is responsible for the linkage of thi genes observed in the eqtl analysis. the s288c allele of thi <dig> also triggered an increase in pdc <dig> expression of about  <dig> log , suggesting a direct effect of thi3p on its expression. in contrast, pdc <dig> expression was only slightly impacted by the allelic switch.figure  <dig>

the deletion of thi <dig>  amplified the effects observed for both thi <dig> and pdc1: a strong decrease in thi <dig> expression and an increase in pdc <dig> expression. the lower expression of thi <dig> confirms that thi3p is needed for its expression. conversely, the higher level of pdc <dig> expression triggered by thi <dig> deletion supports the idea that thi3p has a negative impact on its expression. the expression of pdc <dig> was also greatly increased by the deletion of thi <dig>  in case of thiamine deficiency, pdc <dig> is expressed at a higher level but the mechanism, not associated with thi3p, is still unknown  <cit> . without thi <dig>  59a is unable to synthesize thiamine de novo and to grow without exogenous thiamine. the increase of pdc <dig> expression in strain 59a thi3Δ is probably an indirect consequence associated with a greater thiamine deficiency. in comparison to the deletion effects, the impacts observed for the allelic switch were consistent with our suggestion that s288c allele of thi <dig> is less functional.

we carried out a second series of fermentations at 20°c and examined the impact on gene expression. reducing the temperature allowed us to artificially decrease the rate of fermentation and the glycolytic flux. the expression levels of pdc <dig> and thi <dig> were lower at 20°c than at 24°c  but pdc <dig> expression remained constant. these results are probably due to the lower fermentation rate at 20°c and are consistent with the correlation found between r <dig> and pdc <dig> and thi gene expressions levels. this suggests that when there is a weaker glycolytic flux, the demand for thiamine is lower and therefore, we can expect reduced expression of thi genes and of pdc <dig>  the same effect of the thi <dig> allele on gene expressions was observed in the 20°c fermentation. therefore our functional analysis was validated in four independent experiments, by testing two genes in two conditions.

impact of thi3allelic change on fermentation properties
we observed only a very small impact of the thi <dig> allelic switch or deletion over fermentation kinetics. in a medium containing thiamine  at 24°c or 20°c, both strain 59a thi3Δ and strain 59a thi3-s288c fermented approximately five hours faster than the wild type strain . in a thiamine depleted media, the fermentation remained very slow  and the maximum cell population was lower  than when thiamine is available  for the strains 59a and 59a thi3-s288c. although s. cerevisiae is able to synthesize thiamine de novo, the capacity for endogenous synthesis is insufficient to support growth and fermentation at an equivalent level. the allele origin of thi <dig> has no impact on the fermentation rate . we also analyzed the growth properties of the two strains  under aerobic conditions in synthetic must medium without thiamine and found no differences in growth rates or total cell population . this indicates that growth capacity and fermentation rate in a thiamine depleted medium is not dependent to the strain ability to activate thi genes.figure  <dig>

discussion
lab yeast evolved on thiamine rich media
a genetic approach allowed us to detect variations in thi gene expression and to link them to mutations in the thi <dig> gene. we propose a model of thi <dig> allelic effect on the transcriptional regulation of thi genes by thiamine in figure  <dig> . in the lab strains, the thi <dig> version has a lower efficiency, reducing activation of thi genes. this modification is probably due to the fact that these strains were usually cultivated in rich laboratory media containing an excess of thiamine and are under relaxed selection. again, the lab strains are not representative of global s. cerevisiae behavior, as suggested by kvitek et al. <cit> . the laboratory allele of thi <dig> is not completely defective, as it does not lead to a thiamine auxotrophy. a similar observation has been made for the reduced function of abz <dig> in lab strains; this gene is involved in para-amino benzoate biosynthesis, which is unnecessary in rich media  <cit> .figure  <dig>

allele. the regulation mechanism of pdc <dig> is still unknown.



the eqtl analysis in wine fermentation conditions allowed us to highlight three other genes controlled by thi3: ydr541c , aad <dig>  and tnp <dig> . the uptake of pyridoxine may be important for thiamine biosynthesis, as the synthesis of hmp requires pyridoxal 5′-phosphate . harbinson et al. <cit>  identified a thi2p binding domain by genome-wide chromatin immuno-precipitation and we observed this sequence in the promoter region of both tnp <dig> and aad <dig> . these observations, and the impact of the thi <dig> allele on their expression, suggest a direct role of thi3p in transcription activation of these genes. aryl-alcohol dehydrogenases are thought to be involved in alcohol synthesis and act downstream of decarboxylating enzymes. its control by thi <dig> is consistent with the theory that the two sequential reaction steps are coordinated.figure  <dig> 
thi2p binding site before several thi gene. the consensus sequence was proposed by harbinson et al. <cit> .



moreover, we observed a negative impact of the ancestral thi <dig> allele on pdc <dig> expression. other studies have exclusively used lab strains carrying the weak allele of thi <dig> <cit> . this may explain why pdc <dig> expression has not previously been associated with thi3p. however, muller et al.  <cit> , working with strain m <dig> using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, reported a diminution of pdc1p abundance when thiamine was absent from the medium. this response is consistent with the regulatory role of thi3p described in our study.

the thiamine transporter thi <dig> was found to display a local eqtl. this could be due, once again, to an adaptation of s. cerevisiae to lab conditions. we studied the promoter sequence of thi <dig> and observed an apparition of a thi2p-binding domain in the sequence of strain s288c due to a snp not present in the 59a or s. paradoxus sequences . this mutation is likely to have a positive effect on thi <dig> expression.

however, this hypothesis needs to be validated by functional studies and confirm if these variations are due to positive adaptation or to relaxation. the variability of promoter sequences of the genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis has already been associated with expression variation  <cit> ; which could provide for flexibility across strains to cope with a thiamine deficiency.

thi3p control of pdc1expression causes a switch from pdc1to pdc5expression during thiamine deficiency
we suggest that thi3p does not act on pdc <dig> as a true repressor. when there is a deficiency of thiamine, thi3p binds thi2p to pdc2p, triggering thi gene expression. nosaka et al. have studied pdc2p structure  <cit>  and propose that the interaction with thi3p triggers a modification in pdc2p configuration, which activates its transactivation function and the recruitment of the thi promoter. as pdc2p also triggers the expression of pdc <dig>  we suggest that the formation of the pdc2p-thi3p-thi2p complex reduces pdc <dig> expression through a titration effect. this hypothetical notion is supported by the fact that thi <dig> deletion in strain 59a leads to higher pdc <dig> expression than observed in strains 59a or 59a thi3-s288c. a lack of complex formation is likely to increase the free form of pdc2p, which induces pdc <dig> expression. in contrast, pdc <dig> is expressed more strongly under thiamine deficiency  <cit>  by an unknown mechanism that is independent from thi3p-thi2p control  <cit> .

during thiamine deficiency, pdc <dig> is expressed strongly but the expression of pdc <dig> is likely to be suppressed by the interaction of pdc2p with thi2-thi3p. the reason for this putative enzyme switch remains unclear. hohmann and meacock  <cit>  suggest that pdc5p might have a higher affinity for thiamine than pdc1p which may help the cell to better cope with thiamine deficiencies. mccourt et al.  <cit>  reported that thiamine was slowly degraded during catalysis reactions by both a bacterial pyruvate decarboxylase and a acetohydroxyacid synthase enzyme. the pdc1p to pdc5p shift could allow us to suspect that pdc5p is better at conserving thiamine whereas pdc1p optimizes the rate of decarboxylation flux. these hypotheses need to be confirmed by further experiments including the protein-protein interaction measurement for thi3p as well as the transcription factor and substrate affinity determination for the two pyruvate decarboxylases.

the reduced ability of thi3p to sense thiamine deficiency in lab strains leads to greater pdc <dig> expression; this may have been an adaptive advantage in rich media containing high thiamine concentrations. under such conditions, de novo synthesis of thiamine by thi genes is not critical but the rate of decarboxylation could be optimized. this is relevant to the small improvement of fermentation rate in the strain carrying the lab allele of thi <dig> in the thiamine-rich medium.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data indicate that the thiamine gene network regulation was significantly impacted by the adaptation of saccharomyces cerevisiae to thiamine rich laboratory media which masked some regulatory mechanisms and target genes in this species. therefore, we proposed a putative model of regulation for the main pyruvate decarboxylase in this species, which is dependent on thiamin availability. our results also suggest that, in conditions of high decarboxylating activity, the impact of catalysis on the thiamine cellular content likely plays a role in the thi genes expression levels.
