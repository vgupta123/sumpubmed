BACKGROUND
melioidosis is an endemic and poorly understood infectious disease in much of the tropical world; it is particularly prevalent in east asia and northern australia. the disease accounts for 20% of community-acquired sepsis in parts of northeast thailand. despite antibiotic treatment, mortality rates approach 40%  <cit> . the causative organism, burkholderia pseudomallei , is a gram-negative environmental saprophyte. aerosol or transcutaneous infection results in an extensive range of disease – from chronic, relapsing illness with abscess formation to fulminant pneumonia and septicemia  <cit> . the lung is the most commonly affected organ. concern about the use of bp as a bioweapon has led to its classification as a cdc category b pathogen. while there are several known predisposing factors to clinical infection, such as diabetes, renal or liver disease, alcoholism, or immunosuppression  <cit> , relatively little is known about mechanisms of host susceptibility.

innate immune signaling mechanisms comprise the front line of host defense against infection. toll-like receptors  are transmembrane receptors in the il- <dig> receptor superfamily that are activated by conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns and result in nuclear transcription factor -κb translocation and induction of a pro-inflammatory response  <cit> . tlr <dig>  in tandem with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  is activated by bacterial cell wall lipopeptides and peptidoglycan. tlr <dig>  in association with proteins cd <dig> and md- <dig>  recognizes the lipid a component of lipopolysaccharide  of most gram-negative organisms. the importance of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in pulmonary host defense has been well established  <cit> .

as a gram-negative bacterium, bp has putative ligands for both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . wiersinga et al. found increased tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> expression and mrna levels in monocytes and granulocytes of humans with melioidosis as well as activation of these tlrs by bp in vitro  <cit> . wiersinga et al. also reported a protective phenotype in tlr2-deficient mice infected intranasally with bp. however, they unexpectedly observed that bp lps activates tlr <dig>  not tlr <dig>  in transfected hek <dig> cells.

in this study, we evaluated the roles of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in melioidosis using tlr transfection constructs as well as bone marrow-derived macrophages from tlr-deficient mice. we report here that heat-killed bp activates tlr <dig> in conjunction with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  as well as tlr <dig>  we also show that cytokine production induced by stimulation of primary cells with heat-killed bp is dependent on tlr <dig> but that cytokine release is augmented in the absence of tlr <dig>  we further demonstrate that bp lps and bp lipid a are ligands for tlr <dig>  not tlr <dig> 

methods
preparation of bacteria
bp bp- <dig>  a clinical isolate cultured from a liver abscess of a vietnamese patient presenting for medical care in washington state, was grown for  <dig> hours at 37°c in lb broth. bacteria were washed twice in sterile pbs and resuspended in pbs. the bacterial slurry was then heat-killed for  <dig> minutes at 65°c. bacterial concentration and confirmation of successful killing was determined by quantitative culture on lb agar of the washed and heat-killed slurries, respectively.

lps and lipid a isolation and purification
large-scale bp- <dig> lps preparations were isolated using a hot phenol/water extraction method after growth of bp- <dig> in lb supplemented with  <dig> mm mgcl <dig> at 37°c  <cit> . subsequently, lps was treated with rnase a, dnase i and proteinase k to ensure purity from contaminating nucleic acids and proteins  <cit> . reference strain bp k <dig> lps was kindly provided by donald woods at the university of calgary. bp- <dig> and k <dig> lps samples were additionally extracted to remove contaminating phospholipids  <cit>  and tlr <dig> contaminating proteins  <cit> . lps preparations were determined to have less than 1% contaminating protein as determined by bca reaction . lipid a was isolated after hydrolysis in 1% sds at ph  <dig>  as described  <cit> . briefly,  <dig> μl of 1% sds in  <dig> mm na-acetate, ph  <dig>  was added to a lyophilized sample. samples were incubated at 100°c for  <dig> hour, frozen, and lyophilized. the dried pellets were resuspended in  <dig> μl of water and  <dig> ml of acidified ethanol . samples were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for five minutes. the lipid a pellet was further washed three times in  <dig> ml of 95% etoh. the entire series of washes was repeated twice. samples were resuspended in  <dig> μl of water, frozen on dry ice and lyophilized. before use, samples were resuspended in sterile water. finally, negative ion matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight  mass spectrometry  experiments were performed for the analysis of lipid a preparations to profile structures present in these preparations. lyophilized lipid a was dissolved with  <dig> μl 5-chloro-2-mercaptobenzothiazole   maldi matrix in chloroform/methanol, 1: <dig> , and then applied  onto the sample plate. all maldi-tof experiments were performed using a bruker autoflex ii maldi-tof mass spectrometer . each spectrum was an average of  <dig> shots. es tuning mix  was used to calibrate the maldi-tof ms.

hek <dig> transfections and stimulations
hek <dig> cells were cultured in a  <dig> well flat-bottomed tissue culture plate at ~ <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well in dmem plus 10% fbs. the following day cells were transiently transfected with  <dig> μl of transfection reagent comprised of a 1: <dig> mix of  <dig>  m cacl <dig> containing  <dig> × bbs  and the following dna: nf-κb-dependent firefly elam luciferase and control β-actin-dependent renilla luciferase; and human or murine cd <dig>  md- <dig> , with either tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  or tlr <dig>  <cit> . two different human tlr <dig> plasmids were transfected in conjunction with tlr <dig>  one with g at base pair  <dig>  and one with t at this position   <cit> . dna was added in the following amounts to each well: hu- or mumd <dig>  <dig>  μg, hu- or mucd- <dig>  <dig>  μg, elam luciferase  <dig>  μg, and renilla luciferase  <dig>  μg. when transfected alone, the following amounts of dna were added: hu- or mutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg, hutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg, or mutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg. when co-transfected with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  hutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg or mutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg was used in addition to hutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg or mutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg; or hutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg or mutlr <dig>  <dig>  μg. all transfections were normalized to  <dig>  μg total dna with the addition of empty vector. transfected cells were washed once after four hours and were stimulated the following day with experimental ligands, non-specific stimulus recombinant human il-1β , control tlr <dig> ligand ultrapure escherichia coli 0111:b <dig> lps , or control tlr <dig> ligand pam3csk <dig> . after four hours, cells were lysed with passive lysis buffer  and nf-κb activation was determined in  <dig> μl of lysate by the ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase light emission using the dual luciferase reporter system .

animals
specific-pathogen-free c57bl/ <dig> mice were obtained from jackson laboratories . tlr2-/-, tlr4-/-, tlr2/4-/-, and myd88-/- mice backcrossed at least six generations to c57bl/ <dig> mice were obtained from dr. chris wilson at university of washington. all animals were housed in laminar flow cages and were permitted ad lib access to sterile food and water. euthanasia was accomplished with intraperitoneal pentobarbital followed by exsanguination from cardiac puncture prior to bone marrow harvest. the institutional animal care and use committee of the university of washington approved all experimental procedures.

bone marrow-derived macrophage stimulations
femurs and tibias were harvested under sterile conditions from wild type, tlr-deficient, and myd88-/- mice. marrow was flushed out using a  <dig> gauge needle through a  <dig>  μm strainer and cultured in petri dishes in rpmi media supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum and 20% l <dig> cell conditioned media at 37°c under 5% co <dig> for 5– <dig> days to allow macrophages to predominate. the monolayer was washed twice with hbss or media, and macrophages resuspended in rpmi media supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 1% hepes, and 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were added to a  <dig> well flat-bottomed tissue culture plate at  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/well, depending on the experiment. the following day, cells were stimulated with experimental ligands, control tlr <dig> ligand ultrapure e. coli 0111:b <dig> lps , or control tlr <dig> ligand pam3csk <dig>  in fresh media added to each well. after stimulation for  <dig> hours, supernatants were removed and stored at -80°c until assayed. tnf-α, mip- <dig>  and il- <dig> were quantified in the supernatants using duoset elisa .

statistical analyses
comparisons between two groups of normally distributed data were performed using the t test. comparisons between three or more groups of normally distributed data were performed with analysis of variance followed by the bonferroni post-test between groups. statistical testing was undertaken using stata v <dig>  . statistical significance was declared for two-tailed p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
in order to identify tlrs that recognize bp, hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with plasmids expressing murine tlr <dig>  tlr2/ <dig>  tlr2/ <dig>  or tlr <dig>  and co-receptors cd <dig> and md- <dig> were stimulated with a heat-killed bp clinical isolate bp- <dig> . using an nf-κb-dependent luciferase reporter assay, strong bp-induced nf-κb activation was detected in tlr2- and tlr4-transfected cells with augmentation of the tlr2-dependent signal in the presence of tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  to determine whether similar signaling is triggered by human receptors in response to bp, hek <dig> cells transfected with plasmids expressing human tlrs were also stimulated with bp . tlr2- and tlr4-mediated nf-κb activation was observed in a largely dose dependent fashion. both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> augmented the tlr2-mediated response. we also transfected a hypo-responsive variant human tlr <dig> plasmid in addition to tlr <dig> in this system and observed little amplification of the tlr2-dependent signal upon stimulation with bp . because md- <dig> is a necessary molecule for tlr <dig> signaling, human tlr <dig> transfection was repeated without co-transfecting md- <dig>  in the absence of md- <dig>  a tlr4-mediated signal in response to bp was not detected  although tlr2-mediated signaling was not altered .

since robust tlr4-dependent nf-κb activation was observed using heat-killed bp, we sought to identify which bp ligand activates tlr <dig> signaling. as bp lps was the most likely candidate, lps was isolated and purified from the bp clinical isolate bp- <dig>  lps from the bp reference strain k <dig> was acquired and also purified. moreover, because lipid a is the specific component of lps that activates tlr <dig>  lipid a was isolated from bp- <dig>  hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with murine or human tlr <dig>  tlr2/ <dig>  tr2/ <dig>  or tlr <dig>  and co-receptors cd <dig> and md- <dig> were stimulated with these ligands . in both murine- and human-transfected cells, robust tlr4-dependent nf-κb activation was identified in response to lps from both bp strains and in response to bp- <dig> lipid a without evidence of tlr <dig> stimulation by these ligands. additionally, identical stimulations with bp lps and bp- <dig> lipid a of cells transfected with human tlr <dig> and cd <dig> in the absence of md- <dig> were performed, and no tlr4-mediated nf-κb activation was observed .

these observations in a transfected cell line prompted us to examine the cytokine response to bp and bp lps in primary cells. therefore, bone marrow-derived macrophages from wild type, tlr2-/-, tlr4-/-, and tlr2/4-/- mice were stimulated with heat-killed bp- <dig>  bp- <dig> lps, k <dig> lps, or bp- <dig> lipid a. pro-inflammatory cytokine tnf-α was quantified in cell supernatants by elisa after  <dig> hours of incubation . compared to wild type cells, tnf-α production by tlr4-/- cells in response to bp- <dig> stimulation was significantly reduced, but was completely eliminated in response to bp- <dig> lps, k <dig> lps, or bp- <dig> lipid a. in tlr2-/- cells, however, tnf-α production after stimulation with bp- <dig> was either the same as or greater than that produced by wild type cells in several different experiments . tlr2-/- cells invariably produced more tnf-α than wild type cells after stimulation with bp- <dig> lps, k <dig> lps, or bp- <dig> lipid a . furthermore, tlr2/4-/- cells demonstrated only partial reduction in tnf-α production compared to tlr4-/- cells stimulated with bp- <dig>  chemokine mip- <dig> was also measured in the supernatants of wild type, tlr2-/-, tlr4-/-, and tlr2/4-/- cells stimulated with the same ligands, and a similar pattern to tnf-α production was observed . a higher concentration of bp lps than control escherichia coli lps was used in these experiments because in a separate dose response experiment stimulating wild type macrophages, both strains of bp lps yielded several fold less tnf-α production than similar concentrations of e. coli lps .

the findings indicating augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the absence of tlr <dig> when cells were stimulated with bp, bp lps, and bp lipid a led us to evaluate whether this was an il-10-mediated phenomenon. il- <dig> is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that may be released by cells upon tlr <dig> stimulation  <cit> . we therefore measured il- <dig> in cell supernatants stimulated with heat-killed bp- <dig>  bp- <dig> lps, k <dig> lps, or bp- <dig> lipid a . however, we did not identify any impairment in il- <dig> production by tlr2-/- cells in response to these ligands. in general, the overall pattern of il- <dig> production was again similar to tnf-α production, with augmentation of bp- <dig> lps-, k <dig> lps-, or bp- <dig> lipid a-induced il- <dig> release in the absence of tlr <dig> 

as the tlr adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation factor  <dig>  mediates both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling, myd88-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages were therefore stimulated with heat-killed bp- <dig> and cytokine production assayed after  <dig> hours . compared to wild type cells, tnf-α production by myd88-/- macrophages was markedly curtailed.

discussion
in this report, we demonstrate that heat-killed bp activates tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  we further show that bp lps and bp lipid a are tlr <dig> ligands and we identify augmented macrophage cytokine production induced by bp, bp lps or bp lipid a in the absence of tlr <dig> 

tlrs are innate immune receptors that recognize conserved pathogen motifs and initiate an inflammatory signaling cascade. we and others have demonstrated the essential roles of tlrs in host defense against a variety of pulmonary pathogens  <cit> . tlr <dig> is a promiscuous receptor that generally recognizes bacterial lipotechoic acid, peptidoglycans, or lipoproteins and functions as a heterodimer with either tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  <cit> . lps is the prototypical bacterial ligand for tlr <dig>  <cit>  and is comprised of a core polysaccharide, polysaccharide side chains  and lipid a , a glucosamine-based phospholipid. lipid a usually interacts with tlr <dig> in addition to proteins cd <dig> and md- <dig> to induce a pro-inflammatory signal  <cit> . md- <dig> is a soluble molecule that is associated with the extracellular domain of tlr <dig> and is generally regarded as essential for lps recognition by tlr <dig>  <cit> . both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> are therefore likely to initiate host defense signaling against bp, a gram-negative pathogen.

as expected, our gain-of-function studies using murine and human constructs confirm a role for tlr <dig>  in conjunction with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  in initiating inflammatory signaling in response to heat-killed bp. as tlr <dig> forms heterodimers with tlr <dig> or tlr <dig>  the signal detected after transfection of tlr <dig> alone is likely explained by low level endogenous expression of tlr <dig> in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . the role of tlr <dig> in facilitating tlr2-mediated nf-κb activation in response to bp is further elucidated by our observation of minimal augmentation of the tlr2-dependent signal when we transfected a known hypo-responding variant human tlr <dig> plasmid  <cit> .

we also show that heat-killed bp reliably signals via tlr <dig> and that bp lps isolated from two separate bacterial strains activates nf-κb in a uniquely tlr4-mediated fashion. we further demonstrate that bp lps subcomponent lipid a is a tlr <dig> ligand in cells transfected with either human or murine tlr constructs. our observations that bp lps and lipid a are tlr <dig> ligands differ from the results of wiersinga et al.  <cit> , who used hek <dig> cells stably transfected with tlr2/cd <dig> or tlr4/cd <dig> to show that bp lps signals through tlr <dig> but not tlr <dig>  these differences may be explained by our co-transfection of md- <dig>  a molecule that is not endogenously expressed by hek <dig> cells  <cit> , but that we demonstrate is essential for tlr4-dependent signaling in response to bp, bp lps, or bp lipid a. while the lps of a several bacteria signal via tlr <dig> rather than tlr <dig>  <cit> , some lps preparations that appear to stimulate tlr <dig> may be contaminated with lipopeptides  <cit> . alternatively, there may be strain-specific differences in bp lps structure that influence recognition by tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  although our results indicating roles for tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in this gain-of-function system used heat-killed bp, they corroborate recent work with live bp by others  <cit> .

our studies using primary murine cells provide additional evidence that bp induces a tlr4-mediated inflammatory cytokine response and that bp lps and lipid a are tlr <dig> ligands. we demonstrate augmented bp-induced tnf-α production in the absence of tlr <dig> alone and in the contemporaneous absence of tlr <dig>  this differs from the tlr2-dependent tnf-α production by alveolar macrophages or whole blood stimulated with bp by wiersinga et al.  <cit>  and may be attributable to the different cell types or bacterial strains used. however, our observations of enhanced cytokine production support their findings of reduced bacterial loads and improved survival in respiratory infection in tlr2-/- mice compared to wild type mice. we also observed consistent augmentation in cytokine production in tlr2-/- macrophages compared to wild type macrophages upon stimulation with bp lps or with ultrapure e. coli lps, the control ligand. we have observed this phenomenon in previous studies of intracellular tnf-α production by primary bone marrow cells stimulated with salmonella minnesota re <dig> lps, including in the absence of differential tlr7-dependent signaling between wild type and tlr2-/- cells  <cit> . others have described a role for tlr <dig> agonists in suppressing tlr4-mediated inflammatory cytokine production  <cit>  and a role for tlr <dig> in contributing to pulmonary inflammation in response to the tlr <dig> ligand lipoteichoic acid  <cit> . there are also other examples of cooperative tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signaling in host defense  <cit> . however, we are not aware of specific descriptions of the absence of tlr <dig> influencing the inflammatory response to tlr4-specific stimulation alone. the mechanisms underlying this amplifying effect of tlr <dig> deficiency upon tlr4-mediated cytokine production by bp lps are unclear. if the presence of tlr <dig> is indeed suppressive, our data using lps suggests that mere expression of the receptor rather than activation may be adequate to modify tlr4-specific signaling. other reports indicate that tlr <dig> stimulation may induce production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il- <dig>  promoting a th2-type response  <cit> . however, our data do not support this mechanism of tlr2-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression. to the contrary, we show that bp lps-induced il- <dig> production is augmented in the absence of tlr <dig>  and, despite some differences largely attributable to experimental variability, generally mirrors the pattern of pro-inflammatory cytokine release observed. it may be that in the absence of tlr <dig>  shared signaling molecules are more available to enhance activation of other tlrs, including tlr <dig>  further investigation will be required to elucidate the interaction of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in mediating recognition of bp.

both tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> signal via the adaptor molecule myd <dig>  although tlr <dig> may also signal in a myd88-independent fashion via adaptor molecule tir-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β   <cit> . our observations that pro-inflammatory cytokine production by heat-killed bp is largely abolished in the absence of myd <dig> whereas tlr2/4-/- cells demonstrate only partial impairment in tnf-α release suggest that other myd88-dependent receptors may be important in host recognition of bp. specifically, tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  receptors that recognize bacterial flagellin and cpg dna, respectively, may account for some of this residual myd88-dependent response. trif-mediated tlr <dig> signaling may also play a role in the innate immune response to bp infection. these additional host defense pathways require further study. importantly, our experiments have used only heat-killed bp and we cannot discount differential signaling induced by live bp. thus, additional investigations with live bacteria are warranted.

our experiments also indicate that bp lps is a weaker inducer of tnf-α production in bone marrow-derived macrophages than e. coli lps. others have shown that bp lps is poorly pyrogenic but more mitogenic compared to salmonella abortus equi  <cit> . bp lps may contribute to bacterial pathogenesis by modulating the host response and inhibiting macrophage killing  <cit> . although bp lps is antigenically indistinguishable from the less virulent organism burkholderia thailandensis  <cit> , we have observed that bp lps may be a stronger inducer of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages than b. thailandensis lps . structural analysis of lps preparations from these burkholderia strains is required.

CONCLUSIONS
bp activates tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  in the presence of md- <dig>  bp lps and lipid a are tlr <dig> ligands. although the macrophage cytokine response to bp lps or lipid a is completely dependent on tlr <dig>  in tlr2-/- macrophages stimulated with bp, bp lps or lipid a, cytokine production is augmented. other myd88-dependent signaling pathways may also be important in the host response to bp infection. these findings provide new insights into critical mechanisms of host defense in melioidosis.
