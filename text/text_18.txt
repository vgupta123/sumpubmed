BACKGROUND
macroautophagy  is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process which degrades and recycles cytoplasmic components through the de novo synthesized membrane system and lysosome  <cit> . the activity of autophagy is important for cellular homeostasis, cell survival, development, and aging  <cit> . deregulated autophagy results in many physiological defects, including liver injury, muscular disorder, neurodegeneration, pathogen infections and cancer  <cit> .

in response to stress conditions, such as starvation, autophagy can be up-regulated. cytoplasmic components are sequestered into an expanding phagophore, which finally encloses to form double membrane vesicles, named autophagosomes. autophagosomes are transported and fused with lysosomes, then the inner membrane and cargo can be digested by multiple enzymes existing in lysosomes. the resulting small molecules are finally transported out of the lysosomes for recycling  <cit> .

in the past  <dig> years, molecular genetic studies in yeast have identified at least  <dig> autophagy-related genes  functioning in different steps of autophagy  <cit> . among them, the ubiquitin-like protein atg <dig> is the only protein that could bind to all autophagic membrane structures, thus it is commonly used as a marker to trace autophagosomes  <cit> . before binding with autophagic membrane structures, newly synthesized atg <dig> protein  is processed by a cysteine protease, atg <dig>  thus the c-terminus is cleaved and the conserved glycine residue is exposed, forming atg8-i molecules  <cit> . then atg8-i protein is covalently conjugated with pe through a ubiquitin-like conjugation system, including e1-like enzyme atg <dig>  <cit> , e2-like enzyme atg <dig>  <cit> , and e3-like enzyme atg12-atg5-atg <dig> complex  <cit> . the pe-modified atg <dig>  is relocated to the autophagic membrane structures and mediates the membrane tethering, expanding, and cargo recognition  <cit> .

in humans, atg <dig> homologs comprise of six members: lc3a, lc3b, lc3c  <cit> , gabarap  <cit> , gabarapl1/atg8l  <cit>  and gabarapl2/gate- <dig>  <cit> . the conserved post-translational modification process on these atg <dig> family proteins is essential for their biological function during the autophagy process  <cit> . to fully explore the family members of human atg <dig> homologs, we analysed their alternative splicing patterns and found new isoforms for lc3b, gabarap, and gabarapl <dig>  designated as lc3b-a, gabarap-a and gabarapl1-a respectively. interestingly, comparing to lc3b, lc3b-a lacks only one amino acid  due to the nagnag alternative splicing  <cit> , and has severely impaired c-terminal cleavage efficiency by atg4b, one of the major members of the human atg <dig> family proteins  <cit> . furthermore, we found that arg <dig> was also an essential residue for the interaction between atg <dig> homologs and atg4b in human. mutation of arg <dig> in human atg <dig> family proteins would severely decrease their c-terminal cleavage efficiency, thus affecting their autophagic localization and autophagic flux. taken together, we report the identification and characterization of an essential residue for the autophagic activity of human atg <dig> family proteins, which provides potential targets to regulate the autophagy activity in human diseases.

RESULTS
identification of new isoforms in human atg <dig> family proteins
alternative mrna splicing generates a diverse range of mature rnas, and potentially expands the cellular protein repertoire  <cit> . thus, one gene can be translated to multiple proteins with distinct biological functions. to fully explore the members in human atg <dig> family proteins, we searched their alternative splicing patterns from the alternative splicing and transcript diversity  database which has been integrated in ensembl   <cit> . as shown in figure 1a, we found new mrna transcripts in lc3b, gabarap, and gabarapl <dig>  we named their alternative transcripts as lc3b-a, gabarap-a, and gabarapl1-a, respectively . specifically, the isoform of gabarap-a or gabarapl1-a adopt different 3’ ends, resulting the missing of the conserved glycine necessary for atg <dig> cleavage and down-stream processing  <cit> . lc3b has two tandem 3’ splice acceptor sites  in intron  <dig> . using the distal splice site  would remove aag as part of the exon  <dig>  thus resulting in the loss of arg <dig> after translation.

to verify the existence of these transcripts, we cloned these transcripts from a hela cdna library. the sequencing result for each transcript is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we also amplified each transcript by allele-specific pcr from multiple human tissue cdna libraries. primer specificity for lc3b and lc3b-a were tested by using lc3b and lc3b-a plasmids as templates. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the primers we designed can distinguish both transcripts specifically. as shown in figure 1b, all three newly identified transcripts exist in human tissues. while lc3b, lc3b-a, and gabarap express ubiquitously in human tissues, gabarap-a and gabarapl1-a have tissue specificities. furthermore, the expressed sequence tags  supporting the existence of each transcript were shown in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

three new isoforms could neither undergo post-translational modification nor be localized to autophagosomes
the removal of aag as part of exon  <dig> results in the loss of arg <dig> in the amino acid sequence of lc3b-a . gabarap-a and gabarapl1-a lack the highly conserved β <dig> strand and gly <dig> , an indispensable amino acid for their c-terminal cleavage by atg <dig>  <cit> . thus, these two isoforms may not be processed by human atg <dig> family proteins. to explore the post-translational modification patterns of these new isoforms, we first fused these proteins with myc-tag at the n termini and his-tag at the c-termini. bands detected by anti-myc antibody show all forms of molecules after modification, including the pro form , the -i form  and the -ii form . bands detected by anti-his antibody show only the pro form . as shown in figure 2a, the c-terminal cleavages of lc3b-a, gabarap-a, and gabarapl1-a are all severely impaired. large amounts of pro-form accumulate in the cell lysates.

next, we fused gfp protein to the n-terminal of these proteins and examined their intracellular localization in hela cells under starvation conditions. as shown in figure 2b, except for the three newly found members, all these proteins form puncta in the cytoplasm and co-localize to autophagosomal marker p <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, none of the new isoforms could be localized to autophagosomes but only ubiquitously disperses in the cytosol, even under starvation conditions.

these results show that the newly found isoforms could hardly be cleaved by human atg <dig> family proteins, thus affecting their following modification process and autophagosomal localization.

conformational changes resulting from the loss of arg <dig> inhibit the cleavage of lc3b-a by atg4
the c-termini of gabarap-a and gabarapl1-a could not be cleaved by human atg <dig> family proteins maybe due to the lack of the conserved gly <dig>  which is indispensable for c-terminal cleavage  <cit> . interestingly, the only difference between the two isoforms of lc3b is the presence  or absence  of arg <dig>  suggesting that arg <dig> may play an important role in the c-terminal cleavage of lc3b. to investigate the reason why the cleavage efficiency of lc3b-a from human atg <dig> family proteins is severely affected, we first compared the interaction between atg4b and these two isoforms. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  both isoforms could be pulled down by atg4b, suggesting that the interactions between atg4b and these two isoforms are intact, and the low cleavage efficiency maybe due to other reasons.

then, we focused on the structure of human atg <dig> family proteins. the structure of atg <dig>  <cit> , rat lc <dig>  <cit> , gabarap  <cit> , gabarapl <dig>  <cit>  have been reported. they all contain  <dig> helices at the n-terminus and a conserved ubiquitin fold at the c-terminus. arg <dig> is a conserved amino acid and located on the α <dig> helix of the ubiquitin fold .as the α <dig> helix is the core of the ubiquitin fold, the deletion of arg <dig> may affect the ubiquitin fold of lc3b-a. taking advantage of the known crystal structures of three lc3b homologs: rat lc <dig>  <cit> , gabarap  <cit> , and gabarapl <dig>  <cit> , we performed molecular modeling to assess the possible structural difference between lc3b and lc3b-a. the c-terminal fragments, including the conserved gly <dig> in all three structures are disordered, and atomic coordinates of certain c-terminal residues are not available. given the significant sequence conservation between lc3b and rat lc <dig>  it was expected that the c-terminal tail of lc3b is also disordered in solution. we performed nanosecond molecular dynamics  simulations to determine the motion states of the c-terminal segments of lc3b and lc3b-a in solution. we constructed the initial structures of both isoforms with the homology modeling method using the crystal structures of lc3b homologs as templates . two protein-water systems for md simulations of lc3b and lc3b-a were then built . next, 13-ns md simulations for each system were carried out. since the protocols for the simulations of the two isoforms are the same, the resultant models of the two proteins can be compared to each other.

the modeling of lc3b showed that its c-terminal segment is quite flexible and disordered in solution, in agreement with those structures reported in the lc3b homologs  <cit>  in the simulations, the c-terminal segment of about ten amino acids  were always projected into the aqueous phase and did not possess any stable conformation. in contrast, the main body of the protein is relatively compacted and conformationally rigid . the simulation of lc3b-a reveals that its c-terminal conformation is far less mobile. it is bound to the main body of the protein in a helical form, as illustrated by simulation snapshots of the backbone conformation .

the absence of arg <dig> disrupts a salt bridge between the side chains of arg <dig> and asp <dig> which is also an important internal interaction in lc <dig>  <cit> . also, the absence of arg <dig> leads to a reduction of one rotation in the α <dig> helix, which is important in stabilizing the interaction between loops l <dig>  and l <dig>   and maintaining the ubiquitin fold structure. the absence of one rotation in the α <dig> helix takes the two loops apart, disrupting the hydrophobic cluster formed by leu <dig>  pro <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  phe <dig>  and tyr <dig> in lc3b, leaving a weaker interaction among only three residues, leu <dig>  phe <dig> and tyr <dig> in lc3b-a . together, these changes significantly weakens the dynamic interaction between loops l <dig> and l <dig>  allowing the exposed hydrophobic groove between them to accommodate the hydrophobic side chain of thr <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  leu <dig> and val <dig> in the c-terminus of lc3b-a. thus, the c-terminal tail of lc3b-a may attach to the main protein body, shielding the hydrophobic chain from solvent and preventing the cleavage by the scissile peptide bond of human atg <dig> family proteins, as shown by the space-filling models of the proteins .

the md simulation revealed that the intramolecular interaction in lc3b-a is weaker than that of lcb. to confirm this, we analysed their far-uv circular dichroism spectra under different temperatures. as shown in figure 3e, the spectra of these two isoforms were similar at room temperature, indicating that the overall structure of lc3b-a did not change significantly from that of lc3b. however, as the temperature increased, lc3b-a lost its characteristic minimum ellipticity of the α helix at  <dig> nm at 45°c. in contrast, this signal of lc3b did not change until the temperature reached 65°c. these results suggest that lc3b-a is thermally less stable than lc3b.

in addition, we also used trypsin digestion of lc3b and lc3b-a to assess their conformational flexibility. as shown in figure 3f, lc3b was cleaved into one main short fragment within the first  <dig> minutes and the second short fragment appeared after  <dig> minutes of trypsin digestion. in contrast, lc3b-a was quickly cleaved to at least five small fragments in the first  <dig> minutes. thus, lc3b’s main body had a more compact and stable structure in solution than lc3b-a, despite its more flexible c-terminus. these results suggest that the intramolecular interactions of lc3b-a is weaker than that of lc3b and the c-terminus of lc3b-a may be accommodated into the exposed hydrophobic groove, which inhibits the cleavage by atg <dig> and inhibits the whole post-translational modification process.

arg <dig> is essential for the interaction between human atg <dig> family proteins and atg4b
three continuously conserved arginines  are located together in the α <dig> helix of lc3b. thus, to determine whether these arginine residues are essential for their autophagic function, we mutated each of them to alanine and analysed their post-translational modification patterns by western blotting. to our surprise, as shown in figure 4a, the r68a mutation had significantly accumulated pro-form of lc3b, while the modification patterns of r69a and r70a mutants were almost the same as the wild type protein , suggesting that arg <dig>  not arg <dig> or arg <dig>  is essential for the c-terminal cleavage of lc3b. this effect of arg <dig> in lc3b is also conserved in other homologs of human atg <dig> proteins. as shown in figure 4b, mutation of the corresponding arg <dig> of lc3b  to alanine also results in the accumulation of the pro-form of each protein, suggesting that the biological function of arg <dig> is conserved among human atg <dig> homologs.

the three continuously conserved arginines  are located together in the α <dig> helix of lc3b, which may form a local positively charged area and serve as a potential protein-protein interaction sites. as mentioned above, only arg <dig> can affect the cleavage of human atg <dig> family proteins. thus, we wondered whether arg <dig> was an essential residue for the interaction with human atg <dig> family proteins. since the crystal structure of the complex between rat lc <dig> and human atg4b has been solved  <cit> , we took advantage of these structures to examine the amino acids likely to be involved in the protein-protein interactions. as shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  the side chain of arg <dig> points to the interface of these two proteins, forming a salt bridge with asp <dig> of atg4b. we then compared the binding affinity of lc3b and lc3b-r68a with atg4b in the presence of 1mm pmsf, which could inhibit the cysteine protease activity of atg4b. as shown in figure 4c and 4d, the interaction between these two proteins was decreased when mutating arg <dig> of lc3b or asp <dig> of atg4b, indicating that the salt bridge between arg <dig> and asp <dig> is important for the lc3b-atg4b interaction. we also performed a time-dependent in vitro cleavage assay using purified gst-atg4b, gst-atg4b-d171a, lc3b, and lc3b-r68a proteins. as shown in figure 4e, wild type atg4b and lc3b could finish their cleavage within  <dig> minutes, leaving only the up-shifted –i form protein. however, when the salt bridge was destroyed, there were still large amounts of pro-lc3b left in the reaction mixture after  <dig> minutes. thus, the mutation of arg <dig> or asp <dig> of atg4b impaired the cleavage efficiency significantly.

arg <dig> is essential for the autophagosome localization and autophagic flux
arg <dig> mutation did not abolish the pe-conjugation , indicating that r68a mutant proteins can go through the post-translational modification. however, the functional importance of arg <dig> in mammalian cells was still unknown. thus, we stably expressed gfp-lc3b or gfp-lc3b-r68a in hela cells, and counted their autophagosomal localization under normal culture condition or starvation condition. as shown in figure 5a, gfp-lc3b-r68a showed a significant decrease of autophagosome puncta number in both conditions. furthermore, after the starvation stimulation, the increase of gfp-lc3b-r68a puncta was much lower than that of gfp-lc3b, indicating that the lc3b-r68a mutant protein has lower autophagic activity in mammalian cells.

we also measured the autophagic flux by monitoring the lc3b turnover. hela cells expressing either myc-lc3b or myc-lc3b-r68a were supplied ammonium chloride , a lysosomotropic reagent which attenuates the acidification of the lysosome and inhibits the degradation of lc3b-ii, resulting in the accumulation of lc3b-ii. thus, the difference of lc3b-ii ratio  between the samples in the presence or absence of nh4cl represents the amount of lc3b delivered and degraded in lysosomes. as shown in figure 5b, the lc3b-ii ratio increase of wild type lc3b is significantly higher than that of lc3b-r68a mutant protein in both normal and starvation conditions, indicating the autophagic flux of lc3b-r68a is lower than that of wild type lc3b.

both the results of autophagosomal localization and autophagic flux suggest that the lc3b-r68a mutant has lower autophagic activity in mammalian cells. as mentioned above, arg <dig> of lc3b or the equivalent arginines in other homologs are key amino acids for protein-protein interaction between human atg <dig> homologs and atg4b. the mutation of arg <dig> may decrease the cleavage efficiency by atg4b, thus affecting its function in the autophagy process.

discussion
the post-translational processing of lc3b play essential roles in autophagy, especially in the formation of autophagosomes. in our previous work, we identified three members of the human lc <dig> family, lc3a, lc3b, and lc3c  <cit> . in that paper, we showed that lc3b could not undergo post-translational modification as lc3a and lc3c. in contrast, tanida et al. reported that the c-terminus of lc3b could be cleaved to expose the conserved gly <dig> for further modification  <cit> . to verify our observations, we sequenced the plasmids used in our previous work and found that some of our lc3b plasmids used in the previous paper were lc3b-a, the new alternative splicing isoform of lc3b reported in this paper. this explained our different result with that reported by tanida et al. about the post-translational modification of lc3b.

alternative splicing is an important mechanism for controlling gene expression and creating the great proteomic complexity from a limited number of genes  <cit> . the nagnag alternative splicing which happens in the human lc3b gene is actually widespread in the human genome, occurring in 30% of human genes  <cit> . the nagnag motif is also conserved in lc3b and lc3c genes in different species, including homo sapiens, pan troglodytes, canis lupus familiaris, bos taurus, as well as the lc3b gene of rattus norvegicus and lc3c gene of gallus gallus. protein isoforms resulting from the nagnag motifs have also been shown to display functional diversity, such as signaling activity  <cit> , cellular localization  <cit> , dna binding activity  <cit> , protein-protein interaction affinity  <cit> . here, we report that lc3b-a has distinct post-translational modification patterns with that of lc3b. since lc3b-a can interact with atgb but cannot be cleaved by atg4b, lc3b-a may have inhibitory effect of human atg <dig> family proteins cleavage by atg4b; this needs further investigation. atg <dig> and its homologs were found to be the only protein associating with all autophagic related structures  <cit> . its functions were largely unknown for a long time until recently nakatogawa et al. reported that atg <dig> is responsible for the autophagic membrane tethering and hemifusion  <cit>  and cargo receptor recognition  <cit> . the structures of atg <dig> homologs are important in understanding their functional mechanisms. amar et al. have identified two sites which are required for autophagy by mutational analyses  <cit> . phe <dig> and phe <dig> of atg <dig>  equivalents of phe <dig> and leu <dig> in lc3b are part of the atg <dig> recognition site, and tyr <dig> and leu <dig> are important for the downstream lipidation steps. through alternative splicing analysis, we have found arg <dig> as a new protein interaction site with atg4b, which is important for the initial post-translational modification process of human atg <dig> family proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
the alternative splicing pattern analysis of human atg <dig> family proteins revealed that the arg <dig> of lc3b and the corresponding arginine in other human atg <dig> family members is an essential residue for the post-translational modification of these ubiquitin-like molecules. in addition to its role in stabilizing the ubiquitin-core structure, arg <dig> also plays an important role in the interaction between atg <dig> family proteins and atg4b proteins.
