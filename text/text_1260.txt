BACKGROUND
italian ryegrass  originated in the mediterranean region and is produced mainly for hay and silage. it is one of the most important forage grasses in the temperate zones of europe and asia because of its high palatability to and digestibility by livestock  <cit> .

blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen magnaporthe oryzae , is the most severe disease of rice. blast may cause devastating production losses in rice in epidemic years. thus, many researchers have studied rice blast disease using genetic, pathological, and biotechnological approaches for controlling outbreaks of the disease by determining many aspects of the resistance mechanisms in rice and the pathogenicity of the disease  <cit> .

ryegrass blast, also called gray leaf spot , has recently become a very serious problem in italian ryegrass in japan  <cit>  and in perennial ryegrass  in the united states  <cit> . the causal fungal pathogen of the disease belongs to the same species as that causing rice blast disease  <cit> . disease symptoms first appear as small brown spots on leaves and stems, and develop into water-soaked spots that further progress into round or oval lesions with gray centers and dark-brown margins. if m. oryzae heavily infects leaves of susceptible genotypes, the infected leaves die, and small seedlings are killed within a matter of days.

a diversity of resistant phenotypes against the gls has been observed in ryegrass species, and some resistant genotypes have been found from cultivars and experimental lines in both perennial ryegrass  <cit>  and italian ryegrass  <cit> . in addition, this resistance may be controlled by a few major gene loci  <cit>  with high levels of heritability  <cit> , suggesting that a breeding program based on recurrent selection should be effective to improve the resistance to gls in ryegrasses  <cit> .

in this context, we have identified a locus for a gls resistance gene, lmpi <dig>  on linkage group   <dig> of italian ryegrass  <cit>  and performed targeted mapping of rice expressed sequence tags  around the locus using a synteny-based comparative genomics approach  <cit> . similarly, curley et al.  <cit>  reported four quantitative trait loci  for gls resistance on lg  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> from a mapping population derived from parental clones of italian × perennial ryegrass hybrids. these achievements are expected to promote breeding programs for gls-resistant cultivars in ryegrasses, because breeders can easily screen gls-resistant genotypes using genetic molecular markers linked tightly to the above-mentioned resistance loci.

however, because the breakdown of resistance controlled by a few major genes is a known phenomenon in rice blast disease  <cit> , the durability of the previously identified resistance gene loci in ryegrasses cannot be assured, and other novel loci for gls resistance should be identified and used for developing durable resistant cultivars against gls in the future.

thus, we attempted to identify a novel genetic locus for gls resistance from an f <dig> population by bulked segregant analysis  <cit>  and a synteny-based comparative genomics approach with rice genome information. a genetic linkage map corresponding to ryegrass lg  <dig> was constructed by bulked segregant analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism  and simple sequence repeat  markers. targeted mapping of rice est-derived markers further enriched the linkage map. qtl analysis with the linkage map and phenotypic data of the f <dig> population detected a resistance gene locus that explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variance that was influenced and fluctuated by age of leaves inoculated. the position of the resistance gene locus was confirmed to be distinguishable from previously identified gls resistance gene locus on ryegrass lg  <dig> reported by curley et al.  <cit> . we designated the resistance gene lmpi <dig> as a novel gene for gls resistance in ryegrasses.

RESULTS
evaluation of gls resistance in the f <dig> population
we conducted two independent inoculations each for the second-youngest leaves still expanding and the third-youngest fully expanded leaves, which are hereafter referred to as young leaves and expanded leaves, respectively, in the f <dig> population . we scored after seven days for each inoculation moment according to the rating scale shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

averaged phenotypic values for each genotype were calculated from each datum of the experiment with young or expanded leaves, and all four experiments. actual phenotypic segregations in the f <dig> population were  <dig> resistant  and  <dig> susceptible  plants in the young leaf experiment,  <dig> resistant and  <dig> susceptible plants in the expanded leaf experiment, and  <dig> resistant and  <dig> susceptible plants as the averages of all four inoculations . the segregation ratios were not different from 1: <dig> in the young leaf experiment  and 3: <dig> in the expanded leaf experiment ; however, the segregation ratio for averages of all four inoculations was statistically different from both 1: <dig> and 3: <dig>  these results indicated that the gls resistance in the f <dig> population was possibly controlled by one or two dominant genes.figure  <dig>

detection of a gls resistance gene
to detect the major gene locus, we employed bulked segregant analysis  <cit>  because we succeeded in detecting a major gene, lmpi <dig>  for gls resistance using the method in a previous study  <cit> . first, we used  <dig> primer combinations for aflp and identified two markers, e38/m <dig> and e32/m <dig>  which showed specific signals in both the resistant parent and the resistant bulk. preliminary genetic linkage analysis and subsequent qtl analysis indicated that the two markers were linked together and were associated with gls resistance . this result encouraged us to further progress the analysis using ssr markers from a ryegrass reference map developed by hirata et al.  <cit>  to identify the lg containing the resistance locus. bulked segregant analyses with  <dig> ssr markers revealed four markers that showed specific signals in the resistant parent and resistant bulk. of these, two markers 08-08b and 9-12a have already been reported to locate on ryegrass lg  <dig> with a relatively close genetic distance between them, whereas the other two markers, 12-01e and 17-01h, have been reported to locate on lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . from these results, we predicted that the resistance gene locus might be in ryegrass lg  <dig>  nevertheless, all four resistant bulk-specific ssr markers were selected for map construction of lg  <dig> 

the two resistant bulk-specific aflp and four ssr markers, and  <dig> other ssr markers that have been reported to locate on ryegrass lg  <dig>  <cit> , were then used to construct a genetic linkage map corresponding to ryegrass lg  <dig> with deoxyribonucleic acid  isolated from individuals from the f <dig> population. segregation types of the banding patterns for the aflp and ssr markers are shown in table  <dig>  as a result, the genotypic data of the f <dig> population obtained from two aflp and  <dig> ssr markers were selected for map construction of lg  <dig> table  <dig>

targeted mapping around the locus for gls resistance
lg  <dig> of ryegrass species are syntenic to rice chromosome   <dig>  <cit> ; therefore, we selected rice est clones from the rice est map of chr  <dig>  <cit>  at a genetic distance of approximately every  <dig> centimorgan  or less, as far as possible. furthermore, grass anchor probes that locate on lg  <dig> of ryegrass  <cit>  were selected. in total,  <dig> rice est clones and seven anchor probes were selected, and primer pairs were designed from these. among the rice est clones,  <dig> primer pairs  successfully amplified clear polymerase chain reaction  products from the female and/or male parent. thirty-seven primer pairs  successfully amplified fragments that were polymorphic in the f <dig> population in single-strand conformation polymorphism  analysis. similarly, two primer pairs  derived from grass anchor probes successfully amplified clear pcr products from the female and/or male parent; both were polymorphic between the parents in sscp analysis. most of the sscp analyses showed multiple bands . however, most banding patterns from the sscp analyses could be categorized into the five segregation types shown in table  <dig>  detailed results of the sscp analysis are also shown in additional file  <dig>  in total,  <dig> rice est-derived markers and two grass anchor probe-derived markers, which were categorized into the five segregation types, were used for the genetic map construction of lg  <dig> 

construction of a genetic linkage map
aflp, ssr, and sscp data were analyzed by joinmap  <dig>  <cit> . the analysis yielded a major group with a logarithm of odds  threshold of  <dig>  with  <dig> markers, and we succeeded in constructing a genetic linkage map covering  <dig>  cm with two aflp-, two grass anchor probe-,  <dig> ssr-, and  <dig> rice est-derived markers .figure  <dig>

of the ssr markers selected by bulked segregant analyses, the two markers 12-01e and 17-01h previously assigned to lg  <dig> and lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig>  respectively  <cit> , were also integrated into the linkage map; however, the order of other ssr markers in the linkage map was identical to other lg  <dig> maps from previous studies  <cit> , indicating that the linkage map of the present study accurately represents lg  <dig> of ryegrasses. significant collinearity  between the ryegrass lg  <dig> and rice chr  <dig> genetic linkage map  <cit>  was also observed using the information of the order of the rice est-derived markers .

identification of a novel locus for gls resistance
qtl analyses with the linkage map and phenotypic data of gls severity revealed a locus for gls resistance in the lg  <dig> . three lod score plots obtained with the phenotypic data of young leaves, expanded leaves, and total data obtained from four inoculation experiments had similar shapes and showed peaks at almost the same genetic position . the highest lod scores for young leaves, expanded leaves, and total data obtained from four inoculation experiments were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. proportions of phenotypic variance explained by the qtl at the highest lod scores for young leaves, expanded leaves, and total data obtained from four inoculation experiments were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> %, respectively. estimated additive effects contributed by the resistant parent at the same genetic positions with those of the highest lod scores for young leaves, expanded leaves, and total data obtained from four inoculation experiments were − <dig> , − <dig> , and − <dig> , respectively. the position of the gls resistance gene locus was predicted by 1-lod and 2-lod support intervals of the lod score plot, based on the total data obtained from four inoculation experiments. the rice est-derived marker c <dig> was found to be the closest marker to the resistance locus . since the proportions of phenotypic variance explained by the qtl were similar to percentages of the above mentioned broad-sense heritability, most of genetic factors for the resistance phenotype against gls in the f <dig> population were thought to be explained by a function of the detected single gene locus nevertheless the segregation ratios of resistance to susceptibility in the f <dig> population suggested that one or two major loci are involved with the resistance. we designated the putative gene for the resistance locus as lmpi <dig>  because this is the second major locus for gls resistance after lmpi <dig>  <cit>  in italian ryegrass.

discussion
the severity of gls is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity  <cit> . accordingly, phenotype evaluations for populations in qtl analysis should be conducted multiple times, and environmental conditions during the phenotype evaluations should be as stable as possible to increase the heritabilities of target traits, because higher heritabilities will lead to more accurate estimations during the analysis. thus, we employed the filter-paper method  <cit> , by which we could evaluate gls severity of an f <dig> population four times under fully controlled inoculation conditions in vitro. this overcame the high lethality of the gls and annuality of the italian ryegrass, because the method does not require whole plants, and only requires detached leaves of young seedlings. a correlation analysis for inoculation experiments showed strong correlations, especially between the results for the same leaf age . repeated-measures anova showed no significant difference between inoculation experiments within the same leaf age , indicating the high repeatability of the filter-paper method.

frequency distribution of the disease severity of the f <dig> population in the present study was skewed toward resistance in the expanded leaves compared with young leaves. that is, segregation ratios of resistance to susceptibility in young leaves and in expanded leaves were not different from 1: <dig> and 3: <dig>  respectively. in gls in ryegrasses, the more severe susceptibility of younger seedlings  <cit> , and mixing of lesion types that tends to be more severe on younger leaves on the same plant  <cit> , have been reported. these reports and the results of the present study suggest that it is important to use the same leaves or leaves at least under the same physiological condition for repeated evaluations of gls severities in each plant.

the segregation ratios of resistance to susceptibility suggested that one or two major loci are associated with resistance in the f <dig> population. we then used a three-step analysis to detect the resistant gene locus:  a genome-wide survey of the target locus by aflp analysis;  identification of the lg containing the target locus using ssr markers; and  targeted mapping of the target locus by synteny-based comparative genomics approach with rice est-derived intron-scanning primers. these processes rapidly detected the resistance gene in the f <dig> population and identified a locus on lg  <dig> comprising the resistance gene by the bulked segregant aflp and ssr analysis, respectively. subsequent synteny-based targeted mapping with rice est-derived primer pairs effectively produced an enhanced map of lg  <dig> covering  <dig>  cm .

in the targeted mapping,  <dig> % of the rice est-derived primer pairs amplified pcr products from the male and/or female parent. the efficiency was almost the same as our previous study, where  <dig> % of intron-scanning primer pairs derived from ests on a rice chr  <dig> syntenic to a ryegrass lg  <dig> amplified clear pcr products  <cit> . although it is not clear how much sequence similarity there is between the rice est-derived primers used in this study and target ryegrass genomic sequences, improvement of the primers using a strategy of conserved three-prime end region  primers, which have perfect similarity to target genomic sequences in eight bases at their 3’ ends and thus can be highly transferable markers among temperate forage grasses  <cit> , might further increase the efficiency.

qtl analysis with phenotypic values for gls resistance in the f <dig> population succeeded in detecting a major lmpi <dig> locus for a gls resistance on the constructed map of lg  <dig> . although the maximum lod scores for gls resistance obtained from phenotypic values of young leaves, expanded leaves, and total data obtained from four inoculation experiments were fluctuated by age of leaves inoculated, those were observed at almost the same position on the lg  <dig> map , suggesting that resistance conferred by the lmpi <dig> locus is functional at various leaf ages.

curley et al.  <cit>  reported high broad-sense heritabilities of gls resistance against an isolate gg <dig> and low percentages of total phenotypic variance explained for three qtls with ranges of  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> – <dig> %, respectively, in their mapping population. they mentioned that the reason why the percentages of total phenotypic variance explained were lower than those expected from the broad-sense heritabilities might result from additional undetected low-effect qtls or distorted segregation around regions of the most significant qtls. by contrast, in this study, percentages of broad-sense heritability and of phenotypic variance explained at the highest lod score of the lmpi <dig> locus, which were calculated with total data obtained from four inoculation experiments, were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. although we only constructed the lg  <dig> map to detect the lmpi <dig> locus, these values are very similar, indicating that most of the genetic factors for the resistance phenotype against gls in the f <dig> population can be explained by a function of the single lmpi <dig> gene.

lmpi <dig> locus is clearly distinguishable from a previously identified resistance gene locus for lmpi <dig>  <cit> , because they each locate on a different lg. conversely, one of the four qtls detected by curley et al.  <cit>  was also reported to locate on the same lg as lmpi <dig> locus. unfortunately, we could not directly distinguish between that qtl and lmpi <dig> locus since most grass anchor probe-derived markers, some of which are located around the qtl of curley et al.  <cit> , could not be added to our map of lg  <dig> because of unsuccessful pcr amplification in this study . thus, substantively, we confirmed the genetic distance between these genetic loci using information from an lg  <dig> map reported by hirata et al.  <cit> . on that map, the closest grass anchor probe, cdo <dig>  linked tightly to the qtl of curley et al.  <cit>  but is genetically over 25 cm distant from ssr markers, 08-08b and 09-12h, both of which are closely linked to lmpi <dig> on our map of lg  <dig> . this means the lmpi <dig> locus is probably different from the qtl detected by curley et al.  <cit>  and thus we suggest it as a novel locus for gls resistance.

plant disease resistance genes and resistance gene analogs  often form clusters in genomes  <cit> . both lmpi <dig> locus and the above-mentioned qtl of curley et al.  <cit>  are on ryegrass lg  <dig>  and one of the isolated ryegrass rgas  <cit>  may be located on a corresponding region between the qtls  <cit> . similarly, as shown in figure  <dig>  rice chr  <dig> is known to include some genes for rice blast resistance around a syntenic region to the ryegrass lg  <dig>  from these, a homeologous cluster for disease resistance might be formed around the syntenic region in both the ryegrass and rice, although disruption of synteny between cereal grasses is often revealed in resistance gene loci  <cit> .

most genetic factors for resistance in the f <dig> population used in this study could be explained by lmpi <dig> locus; therefore, the resistance locus will be useful to develop gls-resistant cultivars in combination with lmpi <dig> locus  <cit>  and the qtls detected by curley et al.  <cit> . one major concern has, however, been revealed by the breeding histories of blast-resistant cultivars in rice: the breakdown of resistance controlled by a few major genes is one of the most important issues in the development of blast-resistant cultivars in rice  <cit> . both gls in ryegrasses and rice blast disease are caused by a common pathogenic species, m. oryzae  <cit> ; therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the same phenomenon might occur in gls-resistant cultivars if their resistance were controlled by a few resistance genes. development of convertible multiple line cultivars composed of exchangeable multiple isogenic lines, each containing one major resistance gene, might be one way to develop durable resistant cultivars against gls, as has been the case for rice  <cit> , although the breeding systems for ryegrasses are quite different from those of rice because of the nature of outcrossing.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified a genetic locus for gls resistance from a single cross-derived f <dig> population of italian ryegrass  by bulked segregant analysis. the resistance locus was detected on ryegrass lg  <dig> of ryegrasses and explained  <dig> – <dig> % of the phenotypic variance that was influenced and fluctuated by age of leaves inoculated. since the phenotypic variance and percentages of broad-sense heritability were similar, most of the genetic factors for the resistance phenotype against gls in the f <dig> population can be explained by a function of the single resistance locus. the resistance locus was confirmed as a novel gls resistance locus, because the genetic position of the locus was different from other known loci for gls resistance. we designated the putative gene for the novel resistance locus as lmpi <dig>
