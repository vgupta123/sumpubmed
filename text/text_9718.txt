BACKGROUND
many biological processes can be better understood in the framework of reliable phylogenetic analyses. this is not only true for our understanding of evolutionary systematics and phylogenetics, including tol, but it will also largely contribute to our understanding of diversification at the subcellular, cellular and organismal levels of integration. one well documented example in this respect is the postulated whole-genome duplication  that occurred during the evolution of some species belonging to the saccharomycotina  <cit> . only using a correctly inferred phylogenetic tol it was possible to distinguish between "pre-wgd" and "post-wgd" species of saccharomycotina. other examples refer to our understanding of evolution of metabolic pathways  <cit> , structure of genomes  <cit> , life styles  <cit> , and pathogenicity  <cit> .

until recently, our understanding of the  tol has been based on two approaches, which basically differ in number of species and genes considered:  few genes and large number of species;  large number of genes and few species. the clear advantage of the first approach is the availability of many sequences, e.g. of the rdna locus, in publicly available databases , and, secondly, it is generally rather easy to generate complete or partial sequences of a few genes for a large number of species. besides, the rdna loci have the clear advantage of being universally present in all branches of tol, universal primers are well known and it has been successfully explored in many branches of tol. the disadvantage of the rdna loci, however, is that the deeper branches are usually less supported  <cit> . as an answer to this, various authors started to include multiple protein coding genes in their phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . unfortunately, the rationale behind the selection of these protein coding genes is not always clear, and discrepancies and incongruences between individual gene trees may result in unresolved phylogenetic trees  <cit> . this may be due to different evolutionary rates, and/or different origins of the genes, e.g. whether nuclearly encoded  or mitochondrial in origin . in the second approach, large numbers of genes have been used for phylogenetic studies as an attempt to contribute to the first approach described above. this was firstly applied in the prokaryotes  <cit>  and, more recently, in eukaryotes as well  <cit> . a large selection of genes and/or proteins are concatenated and used for inferring phylogenetic relationships, thereby increasing the phylogenetic signal considerably  <cit> . however, although this approach resolved the fungal phylogenetic tree  <cit>  it also suffers from some limitations. for instance, it does not take into consideration the evolutionary history of each individual gene and it depends on the availability of complete genome data.

here, we explored the usefulness of comparing the cophenetic correlation coefficients  among distance matrices of individual gene trees in order to make a phylogenetically meaningful selection of orthologs to be considered for further phylogenomics studies as well as large scale tol and barcoding applications. we used the fungal kingdom as an example as it represents one of the major clades of life with approximately  <dig>  million species  <cit> , of which only approximately  <dig>  have been described. moreover, the fungi are morphologically, metabolically and ecologically highly diverse and, importantly, the number of completely sequenced genomes is high among the eukaryotes.

candidate proteins to be considered for tol and/or barcoding studies were assessed from  <dig> fungal proteomes by comparing  distance matrices of each individual orthologous protein  matrix,  to compare these with that of a well supported guide tree  <cit> , and  analyze for their phylogenetic signal. the method presented here may be universally applied for the selection of markers in various tol and barcoding studies.

RESULTS
the  <dig> genomes investigated shared  <dig> kogs from which  <dig> were single copy proteins. the function of these  <dig> kogs was assessed from the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome database  <cit>  . the corresponding systematic name, standard name, description, chromosome number and knock out phenotype are presented in table  <dig> . knock out phenotypes of  <dig> genes were lethal  when deleted in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , thus suggesting that they code for essential proteins. genes coding for the  <dig> kog proteins are distributed on almost all chromosomes of s. cerevisiae, except chromosome vi , thus representing the entire genome.

comparing the ccc values of a  <dig> ×  <dig> distance matrices analyzed before  <cit>  using pearson's correlation, indicated that kog <dig> represents the single copy protein with the highest correlation value of  <dig>  . this kog <dig> protein  corresponds to orf yol124c of s. cerevisiae . the ccc values of the remaining  <dig> single copy kogs were compared with that of kog <dig>  any of the subsequent five single protein kogs present in the list of  <dig> kog proteins  <cit> , namely kog <dig> , kog <dig> , kog <dig>  , kog <dig> , and kog <dig> , could be used as a starting point for this comparison, because the correlation values ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the correlation values between the distance matrix of kog <dig> and that of each of the remaining  <dig> kog proteins ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  , and were statistically significant . the majority of the kogs  gave correlation values higher than  <dig>  . as an example, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on concatenation of these  <dig> kogs , which is in accordance with previously published trees. four kogs gave ccc values below  <dig>  , thus indicating that they have different phylogenetic signals. this is sustained by the resulting phylogenetic tree showing a different topology  if compared with that based on  <dig> kogs . for instance, the pezizomycotina formed a sister clade to the basidiomycetes and, s. pombe occured as a basal lineage to both of them, but without statistical support .

among the kog proteins with ccc values above  <dig> , are many proteins involved in cellular processes and signaling. the other tree kog categories  <cit> , namely information storage and processing, metabolism, and poorly characterized categories seem to be less informative . when the kog proteins are concatenated in increasing numbers  it can be seen that the ccc values remains above  <dig>  until  <dig> proteins have been concatenated . thereafter, the ccc values showed a sharp decline, indicating that the kog proteins 44– <dig> have different phylogenetic signals. interestingly, the topology of the phylogenetic trees stabilizes after the concatenation of  <dig> proteins . after concatenation of only  <dig> and  <dig> proteins the lineages with c. glabrata, s. kluyveri, k. lactis and a. gossypii, and that of c. lusitaniae, d. hansenii, c. guilliermondii and c. albicans, and finally the euascomycete lineage of c. globosum, n. crassa, m. grisea and f. graminearum showed varying topologies . bootstrap values of most branches were high irrespective the number of proteins concatenated . however, for two branches, labeled  <dig> and  <dig> in additional file  <dig>  that received lower bootstrap values, the maximum value  was obtained after concatenation of  <dig> kog proteins. the a. gossypii-k. lactis-sac. kluyveri lineage  received only low support, and this was even true after concatenation of  <dig> orthologues  <cit> . this most likely indicates that further improvement can only be obtained by further species sampling in this lineage. summarizing we estimate that 40– <dig> concatenated single copy protein kogs are needed to fully resolve fungal tol. below this number the tree topology may be different, and above this number the ccc values as well as the support values tend to drop.

reevaluating fungal tol
in all phylogenetic trees using 10– <dig> concatenated single kog proteins, the clades i, ii and iii correspond to the ascomycota, basidiomycota and zygomycota phyla, respectively , thus agreeing with analyses using a supertree method  <cit> , a super alignment using restricted orthology  <cit> , and concatenation of six genes  <cit> , and  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> proteins  <cit> , respectively. not surprisingly, the ascomycota formed a sister clade to the basidiomycota, with the zygomycota forming a basal lineage.

the ascomycota are well represented because of the number of available sequenced genomes, and is subdivided into subphyla pezizomycotina, saccharomycotina and taphrinamycotina . the saccharomycotina  formed a sister group to the pezizomycotina , with taphrinamycotina  forming a basal lineage to both . the resolution of the saccharomycotina and pezizomycotina is in agreement with previous phylogenomic analyses  <cit> .

the phylogenetic structure of the subphylum saccharomycotina in our tree  is similar to that based on a combination of  <dig> protein families  <cit> , but slightly differs from that based on an analysis using six combined genes  <cit> . noticeable differences are the positions of d. hansenii, c. guilliermondii, c. lusitaniae and c. albicans. in our analysis and the study of fitzpatrick et al.  <cit> , these four species formed a single cluster , while in the six-gene analysis  <cit> , c. albicans clusters with c. guilliermondii, and d. hansenii with c. lusitaniae.

within the saccharomycotina, seven species evolved after wgd  <cit> , namely s. cerevisiae, s. bayanus, s. castellii,s. kudriavzevii, s. mikatae, s. paradoxus and c. glabrata. the basal position of c. glabrata among these species agrees with results from fitzpatrick et al.  <cit> , but only after removal of fast evolving site classes in their dataset. the phylogenetic structure of the saccharomyces sensu stricto species, s. cerevisiae, s. paradoxus, s. mikatae, s. kudriavzevii and s. bayanus corroborated with previous results of rokas et al.  <cit>  and kuramae et al.  <cit> , but was found to be somewhat different if compared with data obtained by comparative genomic hybridization   <cit>  and a four-gene analysis  <cit>  . in the cgh study the positions of s. mikatae and s. kudriavzevii differ, whereas in the four-gene analysis s. cerevisiae, s. paradoxus and s. mikatae occupied different positions.

the subphylum pezizomycotina is divided into four clades: sordariomycetes , leotiomycetes , eurotiomycetes  and dothideomycetes  . the phylogenetic positions of the sordariomycetes, leotiomycetes and dothiomycetes have been a matter of controversy. according to our analysis, the sordariomycetes and leotiomycetes are sister clades, which is in agreement with other studies  <cit> , although the tree in the latter study was only weakly supported. all these results are, however, in disagreement with data resulting from a four-gene analysis  <cit> , in which the dothideomycetes occurred as a sister clade to the sordariomycetes. the position of stagonospora nodorum  as a basal lineage in the pezizomycetes is highly supported in our analysis   and corroborates with data from james et al.  <cit>  and robbertse et al.  <cit>  who used maximum parsimony. however, in analyses based on a supertree method, and  <dig> concatenated proteins  <cit>  and a four-gene analysis  <cit> , s. nodorum was found to be positioned next to the eurotiomycetes  <cit>  or closely to the sordariomycetes and leotiomycetes  <cit> .

all analyses using concatenated proteins with ccc values above  <dig>   positioned s. pombe  as a basal lineage within the phylum ascomycota, which is in concordance with many other studies  <cit>  using different sets of genes or orthologous proteins and different methods of analysis  <cit> . however, in another study  <cit> , part of the concatenated orthologues resulted in a different position, which was explained by assuming a different evolutionary origin of these proteins.

the topology of the few basidiomycetous species included, representing only two subphyla agaricomycotina  and ustilaginomycotina   corroborates with previous studies  <cit> .

our method of protein selection using ccc values of individual protein distance matrices seems an useful approach as the resulting phylogenetic trees are largely in agreement with those published elsewhere, and, importantly, most of the branches are well supported. the resulting selection of proteins may also be used to analyze the majority of fungal species for which a full genome is not yet available in order to improve our understanding of fungal tol.

the performance of our method, if compared to the recent aftol study  <cit> , was assessed by comparing ccc values between the protein distance matrix of reference kog <dig> and that based on the combined data set of six aftol genes. the correlation value obtained was  <dig> , thus indicating that our reference protein has a rather similar phylogenetic signal if compared to the aftol genes. however, the inclusion of more genes increases the phylogenetic signal as demonstrated in our analysis , which may contribute to the resolution of discordant branches, such as that of a. gossypii-k. lactis-s. kluyveri clade.

CONCLUSIONS
in short, the set of proteins resulting from our studies presents a good selection to be elaborated in further studies on fungal tol, which may include many non-sequenced species. as the proteins were selected across the fungal kingdom and because they represent single kog proteins, they may also be suitable for the development of molecular barcodes. this proposed method is universal and can be extended easily to bacterial and archaeal tols as well as other eukaryote lineages of tol.
