BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small  noncoding rnas that associate with argonaute proteins in ribonucleoprotein complexes   <cit> . micrornas play diverse regulatory roles in development and physiological cellular functions  <cit> . in addition, mirnas are involved in a wide spectrum of human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular and autoimmune inflammatory conditions  <cit> .

post-transcriptional nuclear processing of primary mirna transcripts  by the rnase iii enzyme drosha and its rna-binding partner, digeorge syndrome critical region gene  <dig> protein   <cit> , generates ~ 65- <dig> nucleotide  hairpin-structured mirna precursors . pre-mirnas are subsequently bound to the ran-gtp protein exportin- <dig> and are transported to the cytoplasm  <cit>  where they undergo processing by the rnase iii enzyme dicer into ~  <dig> nt rna duplexes  <cit> . tar rna binding protein  facilitates dicer processing of pre-mirnas  <cit> . ago proteins act as rna chaperones facilitating unwinding of rna duplexes and loading of single-stranded mirnas into ago complexes  <cit> . the mechanisms involved in mirna strand selection in mammals are poorly understood.

we previously reported that endogenous ago2-pre-mirna  complexes are detected in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of human cells, and that pre-mirnps are enriched in dicer-null cells  <cit> . we showed that recombinant pre-mirnps function as riscs in vitro. this finding complicated our in vitro risc reconstitution studies since recombinant ago <dig> in complex with pre-mirnas cleaves target rnas bypassing the requirement for dicer activity. in this study, we identified rna targets that are not cleaved by ago2:pre-mirna complexes. we demonstrated that dicer and ago <dig> are sufficient for in vitro recapitulation of the cytoplasmic mirnp assembly and that trbp is dispensable. we also showed that select ago2:pre-mirna complexes are active against 5'-as well as 3'-arm rna targets, suggesting that ago <dig> binds primarily to the 5'- and alternatively, to the 3'-end of select pre-mirnas.

RESULTS
recombinant ago2:pre-mir-24- <dig> complex directs cleavage of a 5'- but not of a 3'-arm target
we previously reported that mammalian ago <dig> directly binds to pre-mirnas and forms active, non-canonical, risc  in vitro  <cit> . ago <dig> can only use the hairpin-like pre-mirnas as guides for target cleavage when spontaneous or ago2-mediated dissociation of the hairpin arms permits target annealing to pre-mirnas. interestingly, two recent studies demonstrated rna chaperone activity of human ago proteins against rna duplexes  <cit> .

although the function and biological significance of endogenous pre-mirnps is unclear, non-canonical risc activity of pre-mirnps complicates studies of risc reconstitution. to bypass this alternative in vitro pathway, we first asked whether non-canonical risc is also active against targets complementary to the 3'-arm of pre-mirnas.

to test our hypothesis, we preloaded purified gst-ago <dig> with pre-mir-24- <dig> in near stoichiometric amounts and added a 5'-p32-radiolabeled target complementary to either the 5'- or the 3'-arm of pre-mir-24- <dig>  as expected, efficient 5'-arm target cleavage was detected in the absence of dicer, whereas 3'-arm target cleavage was not observed . this suggests preferential activity of pre-mir-24-1:ago <dig> complex against targets complementary to the proximal end of pre-mir-24- <dig> 

ago <dig> and dicer are sufficient for in vitro recapitulation of cytoplasmic steps of mirna biogenesis
although in vitro reconstitution of mammalian risc with recombinant ago <dig>  dicer and trbp has been previously reported, it is unclear whether in this study risc was formed by ago loaded with a dicer-generated mirna or unprocessed pre-mirna  <cit> . having demonstrated inactivity of ago2-pre-mir-24- <dig> against a 3'-arm target, we were in a position to test risc loading, by circumventing the non-canonical pathway. ago <dig> was incubated with 5'-p-pre-mir-24- <dig> and dicer, but not trbp, then provided with a 5'-radiolabeled 3'-arm rna target . reaction products were analyzed by urea-page. efficient cleavage of the radiolabeled ta- <dig> was observed , indicating trbp-independent loading of the 3'-arm product of pre-mir-24- <dig> into ago <dig>  inclusion of trbp to the reconstitution reactions did not affect risc activity . these results indicate that ago <dig> and dicer alone were sufficient for canonical risc loading in vitro.

in order to demonstrate that the 5'-arm product of pre-mir-24- <dig> was also loaded into ago <dig>  in addition to the 3'-arm product, the same reactions were repeated using 5'-radiolabeled pre-mir-24- <dig> and unlabeled rna target. labeled rnas were analyzed by denaturing and native page . as expected, dicer, but not ago <dig> or trbp, processed pre-mir-24- <dig> to ~ <dig> nucleotide mir-24-1:mir-24-1* duplex, which was then dissociated by ago <dig> and formed canonical risc loaded with either mir-24- <dig> or mir-24-1* . although when these reactions were repeated with labeled pre-mir-24- <dig> and unlabeled target rna, trbp appeared to have a mild inhibitory effect on dicer , such effect was not observed when pre-mir- <dig> was used instead of pre-mir-24- <dig>  or when risc activity was tested . irrespective of regulatory activity, the presence of trbp was also not essential for pre-mir-30a risc loading reconstitution . together, our results indicate that recombinant ago <dig> and dicer are sufficient to recapitulate risc assembly in vitro. we demonstrated unwinding of dicer-generated mirna duplexes in the presence of ago <dig> and risc loading with single-stranded mirnas deriving either from the 3'-arm , or the 5'- arm of pre-mir-24- <dig> . trbp is not essential for pre-mirna processing by dicer, unwinding of the rna duplex or loading of mirna or mirna* into ago <dig> 

risc activity of select pre-mirnps is guided against 5'-and 3'-arm targets
we tested several pre-mirnas to demonstrate that a non-canonical dicer-free ago pre-mirnp is preferentially active against a 5'-arm target. surprisingly, we observed 3'-arm target cleavage by select pre-mirna-guided riscs. pre-mir-24- <dig> and pre-mir-30a consistently demonstrated 5'- but not 3'-arm target cleavage, while pre-mir-138- <dig> and pre-mir-103- <dig> guided cleavage of targets complementary to both arms. in the case of pre-mir-138- <dig>  the 17nt 5'- cleavage product of target tb- <dig> , corresponds, as expected, to cleavage across the nucleotide in position  <dig> from the 5'-end of pre-mir-138- <dig> . the 5'- product of the 3'-arm target tb- <dig>  corresponds to cleavage across the nucleotide in position  <dig> from the 3'-end of pre-mir-138- <dig> . an additional 18nt 5'-product is seen, indicating cleavage across position  <dig> from the 3'-end. these findings suggest that, in vitro, in addition to binding to the 5'-phosphorylated end, recombinant ago <dig> likely binds to the 3'-unphosphorylated end of pre-mir-138- <dig>  imprecise cleavage of the 3'-arm target resulting in two different size products suggests weak ago <dig> binding to the unphosphorylated base of the 3'-end. an alternative explanation of these findings would be that ago <dig> processes pre-mirnas and is then loaded with guide rnas deriving from their 3'- arm. however, we have previously  <cit>  and currently demonstrated that such processing is not detected in vitro  at least with the conditions and pre-mirnas we tested using purified, dicer-free, recombinant ago <dig>  ruling out this alternative scenario.

pre-mir-103- <dig>  like pre-mir-138- <dig>  directed cleavage of targets complementary to its 5'- and 3'- arms . imprecise cleavage of the 3'-arm target was noted again, as with pre-mir-138- <dig>  in pre-mir-103-2-guided cleavage, addition of recombinant trbp was not crucial for the use of the 5'- or 3'- pre-mirna arm by ago <dig> .

when ago <dig> was loaded with a 73-nucleotide single-stranded, unstructured rna, both 5'- and 3'- end targets were cleaved, although 3'-end target cleavage was significantly less efficient . this again suggests that ago <dig> binds primarily, as expected, to the 5'-phosphorylated base of the guide rna and can also bind to a small extent to the 3'- unphosphorylated base of the single-stranded guide rna.

endogenous ago2-pre-mirna complexes are detected in nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of mammalian cells  <cit> . we have previously shown that in dicer-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts , endogenous agos are loaded with unprocessed pre-mirnas  <cit> . to test whether ago <dig> binds to the 3'- end of endogenous pre-mirnas, we immunoprecipitated ago complexes from dicer-/- mefs using the 2a <dig> antibody <cit>  and performed in vitro risc assays. in this inducible cell line a small amount of let-7a is detected  even when dicer is undetectable . however, let-7a*, which normally originates from the 3'-arm of pre-let-7a, is not detected in total rna from dicer +/- or dicer-/- mefs . to test the risc activity of endogenous pre-let7-a rnps, we provided rna targets complementary to the 5'- and 3'-arm of pre-let-7a. in addition to the 5'- arm cleavage, a 3'-arm target cleavage product was observed, likely generated by risc activity of pre-let-7a rnps, rather than by canonical, let-7a* mirnps , suggesting that endogenous pre-let-7a associates to ago <dig> via either its 5'-phosphorylated or its 3'- unphosphorylated end.

discussion
most endogenous pre-mirnas are normally processed by dicer and consequently functional mirnps are more abundant than pre-mirnps  <cit> . we have previously shown that canonical pre-mirnas associate with ago <dig> and that in vitro, dicer-free ago <dig> does not process pre-mirnas into mature mirnas or any intermediate products  <cit> . it was subsequently shown that ago <dig> binds to pre-mir- <dig> and mediates its processing via a non-canonical, dicer-independent pathway  <cit> . unlike most mammalian mirnas, pre-mir- <dig> has a unique stem structure, with a perfect sense:antisense complementarity, resembling a 17nt sirna duplex. our present and previous studies  <cit>  indicate that pre-mirnas with stem bulges are not processed by ago <dig>  but are used as guides for risc activity in vitro. our unexpected findings, also reported by yoda et al  <cit> , complicate in vitro dissection of risc biogenesis and function.

in this study, we identified pre-mirnps inactive against 3'-arm targets and this finding allowed us to demonstrate that dicer and ago <dig> are sufficient to process pre-mirnas, unwind mirna duplexes and load single-stranded mirnas into ago <dig>  trbp was dispensable for all three steps in vitro, arguing against an essential role for this protein in risc reconstitution or mirna strand selection but not excluding a regulatory function. several studies have shown regulation of mirna biogenesis by auxiliary factors . it has been previously shown that trbp regulates pre-mirna processing by dicer  <cit> ; furthermore, it has been proposed that trbp is necessary to recruit ago <dig> to the dicer/substrate complexes  <cit> . earlier reports suggested that trbp in complex with ago and dicer is required for risc loading reconstitution in vitro  <cit> . our studies indicate that trbp is not essential for this process.

apart from clarifying the minimal factors required for mammalian risc loading, our results suggest that pre-mirnas bind to ago <dig> via either their 5'- or 3'- end. crystal structure studies have shown that the 3'-  <cit>  and the 5'- end  <cit>  of mirnas bind to argonaute proteins and that there is a strong preference for u or a as a first 5'- end base  <cit> . it is likely that pre-mirnas are anchored within ago <dig> in a similar fashion. we tested four differently structured pre-mirnas and the size of the 5'-arm target product consistently corresponded to the expected cleavage across the nucleotide in position  <dig> from the 5'-end of the pre-mirna. most of the 3'-arm target products corresponded also to cleavage across the 10th nucleotide from the 3'-end. however, additional products were detected suggesting imprecise cleavage, likely due to weak ago <dig> binding to the 3'-unphosphorylated pre-mirna end. it is unlikely that these rna products represent degradation artifacts, as all the radiolabeled rna oligos were gel-purified.

CONCLUSIONS
our results indicate that ago <dig> and dicer are sufficient for processing and loading of mirnas into risc. furthermore, our studies suggest that ago <dig> binds primarily to the 5'-and alternatively, to the 3'-end of select pre-mirnas. results from our experiments using immunopurified pre-mirnps from dicer-null cells also support this alternative mode of endogenous pre-mirna binding to ago <dig>  endogenous pre-mirnps accumulate in dicer-deficient cells, likely because the secondary structure of pre-mirnas and/or their binding by ago <dig> protects them from degradation; normally, ago <dig> containing pre-mirnps are not abundant  <cit> . since it is unlikely that mirnps and pre-mirnps exert redundant regulatory functions on gene expression, our in vitro findings should be cautiously interpreted, until the function of pre-mirnps and biological significance of their risc activity are elucidated.
