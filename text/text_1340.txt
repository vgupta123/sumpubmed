BACKGROUND
models that describe evolutionary processes must strike a balance between simplicity and detail. at one end of the spectrum are optimality models, which predict phenotypic evolution based on natural selection in the context of ecology, often neglecting genetics except in the form of simple 'trade-offs' between phenotypic alternatives. the appeal of such models is in their apparent generality, enabling prediction across a wide variety of organisms and environments with minimal input about genetic parameters. the weakness of optimality models is argued to lie in their neglect of genetic details, the very matrix on which the evolutionary process rests  <cit> . if these details lead to constraint or unexpected pleiotropic interactions between phenotypes, optimality model predictions may mislead.

there is a long history of disagreement about the importance of genetic details in understanding phenotypic evolution  <cit> . there seems to be little resolution. optimality models are still widely applied with apparent success for some biological systems  <cit> , but studies that account for genetic details seem to gain insight from their incorporation  <cit> . as yet, however, there are few studies that both enlist information about genetic details and conduct quantitative tests of optimality model predictions. such direct comparisons of the two approaches are essential in resolving the merits of genetic details in understanding evolution.

here we use experimental evolution of bacteriophage to test an optimality model for a life history trait, lysis time. environmental conditions are easily controlled when growing bacteriophages, making it simple to parameterize and test quantitative predictions about optimality in reasonably well-understood genetic systems. the lysis time model has been tested on three phages, λ, t <dig>  and t <dig>  <cit> , but the present work extends these tests to a pair of phages with a very different lysis mechanism.

lysis time optimality model
most bacteriophages lyse their hosts to enable progeny to escape into the environment . lysis of the infected cell releases all phage progeny at once and so is the phage equivalent of the age of reproduction. furthermore, this life history trait has major effects on phage fitness. the infected cell typically produces phages indefinitely until lysis, so a long lysis interval increases progeny but extends generation time, and vice versa.

a simple optimality model predicts which lysis interval will maximize fitness simply as a function of the intrinsic growth rate of the phage population  <cit> . the optimality model assumes linear accumulation of phages within the cell and parallels a theory of optimal foraging in patchy environments originally developed by charnov  <cit> . it leads to an approximate lysis time optimum of

  l^-e=1r^ 

 <cit> . the optimal lysis time  minus the eclipse time  should evolve to equal the inverse of r . l^-e is defined here as the lysis interval. all viable phage progeny are produced inside the cell during this interval, at an approximately constant rate . since this equation applies at the evolutionary equilibrium, the optimal lysis interval changes when the environment changes or the phage evolves in response to a change in the environment.

the simple model presented here ignores the effects of non-genetic lysis variation. lysis asynchrony  is important in Φx <dig> -like phages and affects the optimal lysis interval. a more complete model that accounts for this parameter was used for optimality predictions throughout .

this model can be explored with experimental evolution  <cit> . as the genetic basis of lysis is well studied and apparently simple for many phages, lysis time is an ideal system for exploring how optimality interacts with genetic details in a life history trait.

lysis in isometric phages
only two assumptions about lysis mechanisms are required by the optimality model; both are met in Φx <dig> bacteriophage. first, average lysis time is evolvable, i.e. mutations exist that can change it  <cit> . second, phage progeny accumulate linearly within the infected cell until the end of the lysis interval  <cit> . by similarity of genome organizations, we assume st- <dig> also meets these assumptions.

st- <dig> and Φx <dig> are isometric, icosahedral phages of the family microviridae with small single-stranded dna genomes. Φx <dig> has  <dig> genes, while st- <dig> encodes homologs to those  <dig> plus an extra region with putative genes, like certain other isometric phages  <cit> . in both phages, only one gene  is directly implicated in lysis  <cit> , and it overlaps, out of frame, the highly conserved gene d  <cit>  which encodes the external scaffolding protein  <cit> .

the gene e protein, gpe, causes lysis by interfering with cell wall synthesis during cell division  <cit> , a simpler mechanism than that seen in larger phages  <cit> . all mutations in gene e known to affect lysis do so by altering expression or by eliminating lytic activity altogether  <cit> . gpe noncompetitively inhibits mray  <cit> , and without this enzyme the cell expands and eventually lyses rather than dividing  <cit> .

Φx <dig> requires the host factor slyd for lysis  <cit> . mutations in gene e that increase gpe expression can restore lysis  <cit> . in addition, when these mutant alleles were expressed from a λ phage construct they hastened mean lysis time in the presence of slyd  <cit> , suggesting a potential for quantitative variation in Φx <dig> lysis time.

we adapted these two phages across serial flask transfers for hundreds of generations to identify the mechanisms and generality of evolution to an optimal lysis time. the universal outcome for Φx <dig> adaptations was a lysis interval indistinguishable from that of wild-type, despite the predictions of the optimality model that a shorter lysis interval should evolve. in st- <dig>  the lysis interval shortened somewhat but did not reach the predicted optimum.

RESULTS
we adapted phages under a variety of environmental conditions to determine if they evolved to lyse at the predicted optimal time. in every replicate, the lysis interval remained longer than the optimality model predicted. changes in the single known lysis protein occurred only when phages were adapted on hosts that eliminated wild-type phage lysis entirely.

lysis time is the sum of eclipse and lysis interval  and the model assumes that eclipse time is fixed and that the optimal lysis time is achieved by changes in the lysis interval. we thus address primarily the lysis interval.

Φx <dig> phenotypic adaptation to e. coli c: failure to evolve shorter lysis time
we adapted Φx <dig> to e. coli c twice under similar conditions, in which the predicted optimal lysis interval was shorter than the initial lysis interval. thus we expected the lysis interval to shorten over adaptation. one adaptation started with wild-type phage, while the other started with a recombinant population to increase initial variation. through this latter mechanism, Φx174+ was provided with substitutions from two lines preadapted to conditions differing slightly from those used here. higher genetic variance in the population should facilitate adaptation. preliminary analysis showed that total lysis time was broadly similar between the two adaptations, so an isolate from the recombinant population  was chosen for further characterization.

following  <dig> hours of adaptation, Φx174c fitness increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  db/hr, an increase of  <dig>  db/hr . no other phenotypes measured changed significantly, although eclipse time was possibly shorter by ~ <dig> min . the lysis interval  did not evolve to the predicted optimum of  <dig>  min .

*minutes, †minutes <dig>  ‡doublings/hour, §10- <dig> ml/min

£under phase ii conditions; under phase i conditions the optimal lysis interval is  <dig>  min and fitness is  <dig>  db/hr

the failure of the mean lysis interval to adapt closer to the optimum over ~ <dig> generations means that even qualitative predictions of evolution failed for Φx174c. within the framework of our model, selection for earlier lysis did exist; from projections based on measurements of life history traits, the evolved phage was  <dig>  db/hr away from the fitness it might have reached at optimality. this potential fitness advantage is large compared to the fitness difference of  <dig>  db/hr between the initial and evolved phages, although measurements of small differences in absolute fitness may not be reliable  <cit> .

Φx <dig> phenotypic adaptation to hosts blocking lysis: failure to evolve optimally despite evolution
the slyd gene of e. coli is needed for lysis by wild-type Φx <dig>  however, in agreement with previous work  <cit> , Φx <dig> mutants that formed plaques on slyd-defective hosts were easily isolated. by definition, any mutant that lyses this host at all lyses earlier than the wild-type phage. we were interested in the lysis time of these mutant phages and of their descendants that were further adapted to the inhibitory host. a mix of two plaques was used to initiate an extended adaptation. after  <dig>  hours of adaptation, the resultant phage  had a lysis interval of  <dig>  min, similar to that of Φx174c . not only are the lysis intervals indistinguishable between the evolved phages on their respective hosts, but the fitnesses are similar:  <dig>  db/hr for Φx174c versus  <dig>  for Φx174Δslyd . again, the virus failed to reach its predicted optimum  by almost  <dig> min .

the mechanism of adaptation to slyd-deficient hosts is increased expression of the phage lysis gene e, which in a λ phage construct results in earlier lysis even in the presence of slyd  <cit> . by this criterion, a phage adapted to grow on the slyd host should lyse earlier when grown on normal hosts. matching this expectation, Φx174Δslyd grown on normal hosts had a lysis interval of  <dig>  min, shorter than the interval on slyd hosts .

on normal hosts, Φx174Δslyd lysis interval was also somewhat shorter than that of Φx174c, although this difference was only marginally significant . if this difference is real it would suggest that Φx174c lyses later than predicted due to pleiotropic costs, rather than absolute constraint.

selecting for later lysis
if our model was wrong because it calculated an inaccurate optimum rather than an unattainable optimum, then a change in the growth conditions to select for later lysis should result in slower lysis after adaptation, because we know the virus can attain that phenotypic state. this can be tested by growing the phage at a sufficiently lower host density to favor longer lysis interval. the same starting population of phages used for Φx174Δslyd was grown on hosts at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml, which greatly lowered fitness. even after  <dig>  hr of adaptation, the final phage  had a much lower fitness  under these conditions than Φx174Δslyd had when grown at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml . however, lysis interval evolved to a similar endpoint . although the optimal lysis time for Φx174Δslydlow  was considerably later than that of Φx174Δslyd , Φx174Δslydlow still failed to attain its optimum .

st- <dig> phenotypic adaptation: failure to evolve optimally despite evolution
st- <dig> initially had an eclipse time of  <dig>  min and a lysis interval of  <dig>  min. the phage adapted to laboratory conditions  had a significantly earlier eclipse time  and shorter lysis intervals , each by ~ <dig> minutes, resulting in lysis approximately  <dig> min earlier than st-1+ . attachment rate was high throughout and did not change , suggesting this adaptation was not driven by attachment evolution. although the burst size estimate was somewhat smaller after adaptation, this difference was not significant .

the lysis interval of the evolved phage st-1k- <dig>  did not reach the predicted optimum of  <dig>  min . this deviation has a predicted fitness cost of  <dig>  db/hr. thus, st- <dig> lysis interval appears to have evolved qualitatively as expected, but did not reach the optimum despite selection to do so.

molecular evolution in both phages
neither Φx174c nor st-1k- <dig> carried any coding or apparent regulatory changes in gene e, which generates the only protein known to play a role in Φx <dig> lysis. thus there is no obvious genetic cause for the decrease in lysis interval observed in st- <dig>  Φx174c contained seven substitutions relative to Φx174+ , two of which were not present in the preadapted founding population. st-1k- <dig> acquired four substitutions, two during the initial adaptation to purely permissive hosts and two more in phase ii when nonpermissive hosts were also present .

while many of the genetic changes of Φx174c were present in the founding lines, two mutations were new. this shows that there was time for new substitutions to fix, and thus the potential for evolution closer to the optimum that did not rely on changes from the preadaptations. all  <dig> of the Φx174c changes together only increased the fitness of the wild-type phage by  <dig>  db/hr, suggesting that any single change moving lysis time near the optimum was not available.

in the two adaptations to slyd-deficient hosts, however, every change observed was in the lysis gene e . two of these changes have been previously observed to restore lytic capacity on these hosts  <cit> . as the adaptations were started from the same population, no conclusion can be drawn from the similarity of genetic changes between the adaptations. however, they do demonstrate that gene e evolution changes lysis time under some conditions. if Φx174Δslyd does lyse faster on regular hosts than Φx174c does, as seems possible  the lack of these gene e changes in the other lines suggests that there is some cost to the changes that prevent them from spreading under normal conditions despite optimality predictions.

discussion
this study provides an experimental test of a quantitative optimality model in a phage system. although optimality models are widely used to explain nature, there have been few attempts to actually evolve organisms to an optimum. is it possible to predict phenotypic evolution using a simple model based largely on natural selection?

optimality models may fail for a variety of reasons. an evolutionary constraint might prevent any adaptation at all from the starting, non-optimal state. for example, in a study of optimal foraging evolution, comparisons between Φx <dig> and the related phage g <dig> demonstrated that selection would favor indiscriminate foraging under certain conditions, yet an absolute genetic constraint prevented adaptation of g <dig> to infect a new host  <cit> . however, another optimal foraging study using t <dig> showed that adaptation was possible for that phage  <cit> . another form of constraint would be genes with pleiotropic effects on traits not included in the model. in Φ <dig>  expansions in host range were often associated with decreased attachment to the original host  <cit>  while in t <dig> a similar mechanism caused a failure of some optimal foraging predictions  <cit> . there is thus precedence for constraint on adaptation of simple phenotypes in phage genomes, but the extent of constraint is variable.

phage lysis interval, and thus lysis time, is likely to be under strong and fluctuating selection in the wild, thus providing an ecologically important model system for the evolution of a life history trait. the lysis time optimality model is based on a trade-off between progeny number and generation time. it predicts how long a phage should wait after eclipse to lyse its host based on the growth rate of the phage, assuming that phage progeny accumulate linearly within the host after eclipse. the model has been previously tested in three phages: λ, t <dig> and t <dig>  in all of those phages, lysis is thought to require a 2-component lysis mechanism; a lysin that destroys the cell wall and a holin that destroys the cell membrane allowing the lysin to access the cell wall. the holin triggers lysis with great precision in at least some phages  <cit> .

the optimality model was tested in phage λ and t <dig> by competing lysis mutants with wild-type phages. in both cases, as predicted by the model, different environments selected for different mutants.  <cit> . in t <dig>  quantitative optimality predictions were tested by allowing lysis to evolve without previously introduced genetic changes known to affect lysis. adaptation had mixed success; selection for late lysis did not generate the optimal phenotype. model failure was attributed to a violation of the model assumption that phage particles increase linearly inside the cell if the normal lysis mechanism is suppressed  <cit> .

this prior work motivated the work here. how would the model fare in a one-component system such as Φx <dig> and st-1? Φx <dig> satisfies the model assumption of linear accumulation  <cit> . in addition, mutations in the lysis gene  have been found that hasten lysis time under some conditions  <cit> . there was thus no a priori reason that the mean lysis interval for the population could not evolve to the optimum.

under selection for a shorter lysis interval  st- <dig> evolved earlier lysis by  <dig> min , while Φx <dig> did not; no changes in the Φx <dig> lysis gene evolved in any adaptation to normal hosts. in none of the adaptations on either phage did lysis interval reach the predicted optimum. quantitatively optimal evolution is not expected in a single step, because a large change is not likely to carry the phenotype directly to the optimum  <cit> . however, it is surprising how far from the optimum the phages in this study remained after adaptations involving a number of genetic changes.

while precise control of the phenotype appears difficult, it is clear that rapid evolution is possible in a different part of the phenotype space. when Φx174+ is grown on hosts lacking the cofactor slyd, it does not lyse detectably, yet the adapted phage attains an lysis interval on the slyd-defective hosts indistinguishable from that of a virus adapted to normal hosts. this is similar to the pattern seen in t <dig>  which can recover from complete genetic ablation of lysis but cannot reach the predicted optimum  <cit> . interestingly, despite the ability of Φx <dig> to recover lysis on slyd-defective hosts, genetic details are relevant here as well; the coding mutations seen in our adaptations were the same as those previously found in another study  <cit> , demonstrating a limited number of paths to maximal recovery and thus the possibility for constraint.

it could be that the phages would have reached the optimum if allowed to adapt for longer. however, repeated evolution of Φx <dig> to a common phenotypic endpoint and the observation that phenotypic evolution was rapid over other areas of phenotype space suggest that this was not the primary limit on adaptation.

instead, constraint on lysis interval, either absolute or due to pleiotropic effects on other phenotypes, seems the most likely explanation for failure to reach the predicted optimum. this may be caused by the overlap of gene e with gene d, which is highly conserved  <cit> , or by the relatively crude Φx <dig> lysis mechanism  <cit> . if evolution were possible but the quantitative optimality prediction itself was inaccurate, introducing major changes that would alter the optimum would lead to a different results, yet this had no effect.

a large part of the st- <dig> lysis time adaptation was driven by changes in eclipse time. phenotypes that are outside the scope of a model may frequently play a role in evolution. when optimality models are tested in nature, researchers often form conclusions after considering only the life history trait thought to be under selection. however, most life history traits, like lysis time, result from the interplay of a number of factors, which may mask the nature of adaptation.

this complexity is also evident on the genetic level. for example, st- <dig> evolved to lyse closer to the optimum  without changes in gene e, the only gene implicated in the widely accepted 1-component model for lysis in Φx174-like phages  <cit> . other genes  that did evolve in st- <dig> may play some heretofore unsuspected role in mediating lysis. however, it is far more likely that, as previously observed in t <dig> phage, genes with no direct role in cell lysis affect lysis timing by altering timing of lysis gene expression or by indirect effects on other stages of the life cycle rather than lysis mechanisms per se  <cit> . similar interactions may make optimality predictions in other organisms more difficult.

CONCLUSIONS
optimality models can be used in two ways: as a means of producing accurate phenotypic predictions or as null hypotheses. as null hypotheses, optimality models help us detect and explore violations of model assumptions. here, for example, the quantitative optimality model was strictly required in order to identify constraint. however, it may be that even in well studied systems, genetic details make it difficult to use simple models to quantifiably predict the evolution of life history traits across taxa. the constraint we observed, the difference in model success between replicates from different species, and the evolution of traits outside the scope of the model are all consistent with this outlook.
