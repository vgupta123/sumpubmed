BACKGROUND
smad transcription factors are the core members of transforming growth factor β  pathway, which has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and specification of developmental fate  <cit> . smads transmit signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus in response to tgf-β. the general molecular mechanisms of the tgf-β/smad pathway from the cell membrane to the formation of a smad complex in the nucleus are fairly well established. briefly, tgf-β elicits its molecular actions by binding to trans-membrane receptors, tgfbr <dig> and tgfbr <dig>  which form an oligomeric complex and then transmit the signal into the cell via phosphorylation of smad2/ <dig> proteins. phosphorylated smad2/ <dig> forms dimers or trimers with another protein, smad <dig>  and this resultant smad complex is then translocated to the nucleus where it interacts with other dna-binding co-regulators to modulate the transcription of tgf-β/smad target genes  <cit> .

the tgf-β stimulated smad3/ <dig> binds to 5'-gtct-3', or its complement 5'-agac-3', called smad-bindingelement , with very low affinity  <cit> . it was initially thought that the presence of multiple sbes in the target promoters likely enables tight binding, since activated smad complexes consist of smad oligomers. however, known smad target promoters seldom contain sbe concatemers, and those that contain up to four sbes still require cooperating factors for effective dna binding  <cit> . the list of dna-binding smad partners, such as e2f <dig>  <cit> , ap <dig>  <cit> , pbx <dig>  <cit> , oct <dig>  <cit>  and p300/cbp  <cit> , is rapidly growing, and it is now believed that the high-affinity binding of the smad complex occurs through the incorporation of one or more different dna-binding cofactors into the complex. hence, the net effect of smad complex likely depends on transcriptional modules, in which the sbes and partner transcription factor binding sites  are present in specific context. this mode of interaction provides a basis for high affinity and selectivity of target gene recognition and allows for the differential action of tgf-β in different cell types  <cit> . thus understanding the complex nature of tgf-β/smad signaling requires knowing not only the set of genes bound and regulated by smad, but also its interacting transcription factors  and the promoter regions where these interactions occur.

abnormal activation or repression of tgf-β regulated processes is implicated in many diseases including renal, hepatic, and neurodegenerative disorders. epithelial cells have a high turnover and their progenitor cells divide continuously, making them prime targets for genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to cell transformation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . in cancer development and progression, the tgf-β/smad signaling pathway functions as a double-edged sword, acting as a tumor suppressor in early tumorigenesis and as a tumor enhancer in late tumorigenesis  <cit> . while regulation of normal epithelial cell growth and differentiation is contingent upon appropriate up- or down-regulation of tgf-β/smad responsive genes, this homeostasis is disrupted during neoplastic processes, resulting in outgrowth and invasion of transformed cells. it has been reported that neoplastic cells become non-responsive to tgf-β/smad signaling activation, despite the fact that upstream regulators, such as tgfbr <dig>  remain genetically intact  <cit> . it is suggested that other aberrant events, perhaps affecting co-regulators of this growth inhibitory pathway, trigger signaling perturbations in tgf-β/smad downstream targets. although a few loci have been described in the literature, comprehensive identification of these co-regulator factors has yet to be performed  <cit> .

in this study, we systematically identified tgf-β/smad regulated and synchronously coexpressed gene sets  on genome-scale by simultaneously conducting chip-chip  and mrna expression profiling in an immortalized ovarian surface epithelial  cell line. the identified target genes were classified into synexpression groups based on their temporal changes in expression after the tgf-β/smad signaling activation. sequence analyses of target regions in each synexpression group revealed conserved sbes and partner tfbss. we applied the random forest   <cit>  algorithm followed by classification and regression tree   <cit>  analysis to classify different synexpression target groups based on the presence of sbes and binding sites of probable co-regulatory transcription factors. several transcription factor modules were derived from this combined classification analysis, providing for the first time a comprehensive modeling of tgf-β/smad-co-regulator interactions in ovarian surface epithelial cells and important hypotheses for further experimental work.

RESULTS
identification of tgf-β/smad direct target promoters by chip-chip
genome-wide discovery of tgf-β/smad targets was conducted by chip-chip using a promoter microarray of ~ <dig>  annotated promoter regions in the human genome. to probe the arrays, we performed different chip assays by using an antibody against smad <dig> in immortalized ovarian surface epithelial  cells treated with tgf-β  <dig> for  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. the immunoprecipitated dna was hybridized to an agilent 44k promoter array , and the experiments were repeated once  <cit> . we observed high positive correlation between the normalized log ratios  of the biological replicate experiments, which demonstrates the reproducibility of the experiments . a probe with weighted binding ratio at the 3-hr time point above  <dig>  and having at least a 30% increase in relative binding compared to the  <dig> hr time point was considered as bound .

identification of tgf-β/smad responsive genes by geneexpression profiling
in order to identify tgf-β transcriptionally responsive genes, we have used an affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig> microarray to globally assess the gene expression in iose cells treated with tgf-β <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs. the experiments at each time point were repeated once, as described in methods, and the gene expression estimates from the replicate experiments were remarkably similar . we performed analysis of variance to study the effect of time on gene expression and identify those genes that are differentially expressed in at least one time point  as compared to the  <dig> hr control .

identification of synexpression groups of tgf-β/smad direct targets by intersection of chip-chip and gene expression data
this analysis of chip-chip experiments identified  <dig>  smad4-bound genes in iose cells, while expression microarrays identified  <dig>  genes having expression changes following tgf-β treatment. by combining the results from the two microarray platforms, we identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes that were bound by smad <dig> in their promoter regions upon activation by tgf-β . one of the main goals of our study was to identify transcriptional modules containing sbe within the smad target promoters. previous studies have demonstrated the utility of tfbs analyses of co-expressed gene sets to reveal cis-regulatory mechanisms in the target promoters  <cit> . we, therefore, performed hierarchical clustering of the expression data of the  <dig> genes  to determine different synexpression groups of tgf-β/smad direct targets. to identify informative gene clusters that correspond to major synexpression groups, we pruned the hierarchical tree and identified  <dig> branches, including two major  and three minor  groups . we considered a group as major if it contained at least  <dig> genes. the major groups  <dig> and  <dig> respectively correspond to up- and down-regulatory expression patterns. group  <dig> consists of  <dig> genes that showed elevated gene expression in at least one time point and group  <dig> consisted of  <dig> genes that showed decreased expression in comparison to  <dig> hr time point. group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had one, four and three genes, respectively. we, then, focused on the two largest groups, group  <dig> and  <dig> for further analyses to derive the smad modules.

target genes within the up-regulated group were further divided into two major and one minor branch. the expression level of the  <dig> genes in the major branch increased after tgf-β treatment and remained steadily high; we labeled this major branch the "sustained up-regulated group". on the other hand, the expression of the  <dig> genes in the middle branch had significantly increased at  <dig> hrs , and returned to baseline expression over the 12-hr period. the genes in this synexpression group were labeled the "transient up-regulated group". the bottom branch had only one gene, atxn <dig>  with an elevated expression at the  <dig> and  <dig> hr time points and repressed expression at the  <dig> hr time point. overall, we have identified  <dig> major synexpression groups – sustained up-regulated , transient up-regulated  and down-regulated .

experimental validation of tgf-β/smad binding
smad <dig> binding of  <dig> randomly selected loci of the  <dig> targets that were shown to both bind smad <dig> and change gene expression in response to tgf-β, were confirmed in individual chip assays. on average, greater than  <dig>  fold-enrichment was observed in iose cells after  <dig> hrs treatment with tgf-β <dig> . rt-pcr analysis was used to confirm altered expression of five group  <dig>  two group  <dig>  and three group  <dig> genes at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs after tgf-β stimulation . specifically, we observed that the increase in expression of adam <dig>  fbxo <dig>  runx1t <dig>  and ddah  was maintained at the time-course between  <dig> and  <dig> hrs after treatment, while znf <dig>  showed increased expression at the  <dig> hr time point and gradual decrease to base-line level at the  <dig> hr time point. decreased expression of frat and cxxc <dig>  was observed at  <dig> hrs after treatment. expression levels of these two genes tended to increase afterwards, but remained below baseline levels by  <dig> hrs of treatment. on the other hand, expression of ntn <dig>  adpn, and rgs <dig>  continued to decrease at  <dig> hrs or  <dig> hrs after treatment. to summarize, the overall trends of temporal changes of expression and binding by smad <dig> observed in our microarray platforms were recapitulated by the rt-pcr and chip-pcr experiments, respectively.

random forest variable selection followed by cart modeling identified novel co-regulatory modules in tgf-β/smad-responsive genes
in order to infer potential cis-regulatory smad modules and to discriminate target promoters of different synexpression gene groups, we applied classification methods driven by statistical learning approaches. for this classification analysis, we choose three major synexpression groups  as different classes. the tfbss, predicted by match program, using the transfac  position weight matrices , were used as the predictor variables of the classification function. each predictor variable takes binary values  <dig> or  <dig> depending on the presence or absence of corresponding tfbs in the promoter region of interest. an attempt to classify the three synexpression groups  by 3-class classifier resulted in very poor classification models , probably due to insufficient power as a result of the small sample sizes in each group. we, therefore, proceeded with a binary classification approach to build different classifiers for the two datasets – dataset  <dig>  and dataset  <dig> .

we determined the presence of sbes in the  <dig> putative targets using the position weight matrix that we developed on  <dig> experimentally known sbes. the consensus sequence of sbes is highly degenerate with a 5-bp core sequence cagac . we scanned  <dig> kbp region  around all the positive 60-mer probes on the promoter microarray and found that  <dig>  of the aforementioned  <dig> loci contained at least one sbe . the criterion set for searching sbes was based on the upper limit of sonicated dna fragment length  in the chip assay. to confirm the significant enrichment of sbes in the target regions, we scanned for sbes in a randomly selected  <dig>  sequences of length  <dig>  bp from the human genome. we found that 71% of these regions contained at least one sbe at the same cutoff used for scanning the target regions. this suggests that there is a significant enrichment of sbes  in the  <dig> putative targets in comparison to the random set of sequences of similar length.

next, we computationally analyzed the  <dig> loci for the presence of other tfbss. a 440-bp sequence region centered on one sbe was obtained. this window  was used because  <dig> bp is the estimated length of dna in one nucleosome. for sequences with more than one sbe, the one closest to the center of the  <dig>  bp region was chosen. the match program was used to predict the tfbss  <cit> . these binding sites, present in at least 35% of either group , were retained in the data matrix as predictor variables. the 35% cut-off was arbitrarily chosen to keep the number of the predictor variables within a reasonable range. to increase our confidence, we tested and found that variation of this cut-off from 20% to 40% did not influence the outcome of the analyses. the final data-matrices contained a set of  <dig> and  <dig> tfbss as predictor variables for dataset  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

we initially fitted cart and rf models to our data. a direct application of these models did not provide satisfactory prediction accuracies . however, a feature of rf that is especially relevant in the current analyses is the variable importance measure, which estimates the relative importance of the tfbss in discriminating one group from another and helps to select the tfbss that are probably involved in the smad modules. rf provided a rank for each of the prediction variables based on mean decrease in accuracy of classification. we present the top  <dig> ranked variables identified by rf analyses in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  we also collected transcription factors that are known to interact synergistically with smad from published literature and the information is presented in table  <dig>  it is interesting to note that more than one third of the tfs in the rf generated lists  are previously known to interact cooperatively with smad. on the other hand, of the  <dig> known smad co-regulators in table  <dig>  27% and 45% were respectively represented in the top  <dig> tfbss selected by rf from datasets  <dig> and  <dig> . we then fitted the cart model on subsets of these pre-selected variables. using this implementation, the misclassification rates were dramatically improved in all the cases . although some misclassification rates were still high, the classification model and the rf generated lists provided an important first step in the direction of predicting cis-regulatory modules involving smad.

for each dataset, the synexpression group labeling was the dependent variable and the tfbss were the independent variables. cart model was derived by using gini splitting criterion, equal prior setting, unitary cost and a 10-fold cross validation. the best tree was selected by minimum cost. the error rates were the rates on the test sample by cross validation. rf was run with stratified sampling with an equal sample size for both classes, whereas the sample size was set to the one of the class with smaller number of observations. the error rates were the average of out-of-bag error rates of  <dig> runs of rf, each with  <dig> trees. rf + cart was to build a cart model on the top most important variables selected by rf. for both datasets, rf + cart provided the best classification results with lowest misclassification rates.

the binary trees constructed by cart are presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  six tgf-β/smad co-regulators that could influence the expression status of target genes in each synexpression group, lef <dig>  elk <dig>  couptf, e2f, p <dig> and pax <dig>  were identified. the presence or absence of four of these tfbss  distinguished between up- and down-regulated tgf-β/smad targets, and binding of p <dig> and pax <dig> was associated with up-regulated genes . the dr <dig> in the cart tree that discriminates the subgroups of up-regulated targets stands for direct repeat  <dig>  a dna site bound by transcription factors ppar, hnf- <dig>  couptf and rar from the family of thyroid hormone receptor-like factors. table s <dig>  contains the list of modules and their target genes. interestingly, several up-regulated target genes , predicted to have a p <dig> binding site, have been validated experimentally by others, indicating that our prediction approach is correct for these three genes  <cit> . to further validate our model, we performed rnai knock-down experiments for adam <dig>  <cit> , a gene predicted to have smad <dig> and e2f binding sites and whose expression is upregulated in normal ovarian epithelial cells . however, only a slight decrease in adam <dig> expression was observed after knock-down of smad <dig> in tgf-β-treated iose, suggesting that additional factors regulate expression of this smad <dig> target gene  <cit> . in this regard, our future experiments will investigate a role for e2f play in the control of adam <dig> expression.

functional analyses of tgf-β/smad-responsive genes
we performed ingenuity pathway analysis  in order to find significant molecular functional categories in samd-target gene set and transform the target genes into a set of relevant networks by using literature-based records that are maintained in the ingenuity pathway knowledge base. we first performed ipa analyses independently on smad-responsive genes  and smad target genes . the analyses produced  <dig> significant molecular and cellular functions  that are significantly enriched in both gene sets. we found considerable overlap in the predicted pathways from both the data sets, and wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as one of the most significant pathways . further, lef <dig>  an important transcription factor of β-catenin pathway, was predicted as a co-regulator of smad in our predicted smad modules. the cooperation between tgf-β and wnt signaling pathways was also shown by several of earlier studies  <cit> .

only significant signaling pathways are listed. ratio shows the relative overlap between number of molecules per pathway within each dataset over the total number of pathway-specific molecules present in ingenuity knowledge base.

discussion
through the interactions of different co-regulators, specific transcription factors can regulate different cellular processes which sometimes lead to opposite downstream effects  <cit> . smad transcription factors rely on transcription cofactors for appropriate activation or repression of target genes in response to tgf-β. tgf-β/smad signaling pathway is important for growth inhibition in normal ovarian epithelium, thus signaling disruption may lead to ovarian tumorigenesis  <cit> . although primary ovarian cancer retains tgf-β-mediated growth inhibition, studies demonstrated that most ovarian cancer are non-responsive to tgf-β signaling pathway  <cit> . the cell line that we used in this study is responsive to tgf-β thus allowing us to evaluate the disruption of tgf-β signaling pathway in ovarian cancer. while most of the recent studies used expression microarrays to interrogate tgf-β targets in a particular system, those approaches cannot differentiate between direct and in-direct tgf-β/smad <dig> targets  <cit> . in our study, we combined both chip-chip and expression microarray data to identify tgf-β/smad <dig> targets. this approach provides important information regarding the direct tgf-β/smad <dig> targets as they relate to ovarian biology. the regulatory module that we identified may also be important in understanding the disruption of tgf-β signaling in ovarian cancer. only  <dig> out of the  <dig> tgf-β/smad targets were previously known to respond to tgf-β in various systems . thus, more than 90% of the targets identified in this study are novel targets.

to gain further insight into the potential biological relevance of these newly identified tgf-β/smad targets, we classified the  <dig> targets by biological functions. this analysis revealed that the majority of the targets are related to either signaling pathways or play a role in transcriptional regulation . for example, expression of the kit ligand, kitlg, is downregulated after addition of tgf-β, a result consistent with a previous study demonstrating that treatment of rat ovarian surface epithelial cells with tgf-β results in kitlg downregulation  <cit> . interestingly, kitlg is an important regulator of ovarian surface epithelial cell growth, and up-regulation of kitlg expression has been reported in ovarian cancer  <cit> . taken together, these observations suggest that disruption of tgf-β signaling pathway may lead to altered kitlg expression, which in turn could contribute to ovarian cancer carcinogenesis. an exciting extension is the possibility of kitlg activation in ovarian cancer initiating cells , as we recently reported upregulation of the kitlg receptor, c-kit/cd <dig>  in this highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cells in human ovarian adenocarincomas  <cit> .

it is interesting to note that tgfbr <dig> and smad <dig> were among the down-regulated targets, suggesting a possible negative feedback loop in the pathway. since our microarray platform spans only the promoter regions, the number of binding sites in the present study is likely to be an underestimate at the whole genome level as recent finding indicates that the transcription factor binding happens throughout the genome  <cit> . on the other hand, we have identified a total of  <dig> smad <dig> targets by chip-chip, but only  <dig> shows expression changes. the other  <dig> targets, however, may show expression changes after  <dig> hours of tgf-β stimulation but could not be detected in the current setting. alternatively, those targets may require other transcription factor for initiation. although the presence of false positive cannot be excluded, our experimental design, in which the chip-chip data is subtracted from  <dig> hr after addition of tgf-β to  <dig> hr, should have minimized this possibility.

in order to decipher complex gene regulatory networks associated with signaling pathways that play critical roles in normal and aberrant cell behavior, accurate prediction of transcription factor co-regulatory modules is essential  <cit> . computational analyses that rely solely on motifs derived from position weight matrix scanning are considered far from perfect and known to produce both false-positive and false-negative results  <cit> . phylogenetic footprinting, can be used to identify conserved sequences between distantly related species thereby improving module discovery  <cit> . however, this comparative genomics approach can only partially improve prediction accuracy due to the lack of conserved binding sites among species and the unavailability of human gene counterparts in other organisms for comparative genomic analysis. with the advance of chip-chip technologies, we can now computationally interrogate the interactions between cis-acting elements and transcription factors using experimental data  <cit> . recently, computational approaches that combine seemingly disparate experimental data have been successful in developing concise pathway models and transcriptional modules  <cit> . rfs have been receiving increased attention in the data-mining field as a means of variable selection in many classification tasks in computational biology, including the selection of a subset of genetic markers and genes in microarray data analysis relevant for the prediction of a certain disease  <cit> . here, we have used an integrative modeling approach that combines cart and rf to classify different smad target promoters with reasonably good classification accuracy and reduced instability. other popular classification methods, such as naïve bayes tree, logistic model tree, bagging and logitboost  or combination of these algorithms with rf may give different performance results and derive different smad modules, which needs a systematic testing. although the main goal in classification is to build a model with minimal mis-classification error in cross-validation , in this application we are equally interested in identifying tfbss as highly important discriminating variables. one of the main goals of our analyses is to select potential smad interacting transcription factors from a large feature space  in order to build smad modules. rf algorithm generates internal estimates of the decrease in the classifier's overall accuracy if that particular variable was not used in building the classifier. thus, variables  with larger importance measures can be deemed to have more power in discriminating different groups. a notable fact about our rf feature selection procedure is that more than one third of the transcription factors in the top ranking variables  are previously known to synergistically interact with smad in regulating the target promoter . conversely, a substantial number of the known smad co-regulators appeared as the most important variables . this demonstrates the power of rf feature selection procedure and indicates that other top ranking transcription factors could be novel partners of smad, resulting in different transcriptional outcomes.

we first built a large number of rfs to identify and rank tfbss of importance; and then supplied the resultant tfbss as a relatively smaller set of predictor variables to cart for classification, using step-wise forward selection procedure. based on our original microarray data, this process dramatically improved the misclassification error rate compared to using cart or rf analysis alone. by running a large number of rfs, we obtained a stable rank for the most important variables, which could not be achieved with a single rf run. when fitting the cart model, a series of models were built, starting with the most important tfbs as the predictor variable, followed by systematically adding more tfbss from the variable reservoir. as expected, the overall misclassification error rate  first decreased and then increased again . the one at the bottom of the decreasing trend is the best model, overcoming the limitation of using pre-set arbitrary cutoff values for variable selection in other cart models  <cit> .

by computational prediction, 83% of the target promoters contained smad <dig> consensus sequences, a significant enrichment compared to a random set of sequences. the consensus sequence of the sbe, nevertheless, contains only a weak signal. to ensure the binding of the smad complex, the presence of the binding sites of the co-regulators is equally important. based on the chip-chip data, the combined classification tree analysis accurately predicted previously known tgf-β/smad co-regulators, including lef <dig>  <cit> , elk <dig>  <cit> , couptf  <cit> , e2f  <cit> , and p <dig>  <cit> . the transcription factors that recognize the dr <dig> site, ppar, hnf- <dig>  couptf and rar are all known smad partners  <cit> . the combined rf and cart analysis also uncovered a novel co-regulator, pax <dig>  a paired-homeodomain transcription factor and important regulator of pancreas development  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated regulation of pax <dig> expression by activin a, a tgf-β superfamily member, and transcriptional regulation via interactions between paired domain transcription factors pax <dig> and pax <dig> and smad  <cit> . therefore, it seems reasonable to suggest that our computational prediction of a pax4-smad interaction and subsequent target gene co-binding could contribute to gene up-regulation . furthermore, as a potential tumor suppressive function for pax <dig> has recently been reported  <cit> , we speculate that disruption of pax <dig> could compromise tgf-β-mediated growth inhibition and contribute to ovarian carcinogenesis.

our integrative computational modeling and ingenuity pathway analysis suggests that smad and lef <dig> co-regulate some of the up-regulated smad responsive genes. it was shown that the activation of msx <dig> gene was mediated via the cooperative binding of smad <dig> at two sbes and of lef <dig> at two lef1/tcf binding sites  <cit> . however, these predicted smad regulatory modules need to be confirmed by biological experiments. first, quantitative chip-pcr with the antibody against a tf can corroborate the recruitment of the tf to the promoter region of the target gene. second, a promoter of a target gene with a tfbs deleted can be compared to a wild-type promoter to see if the tfbs confers any biological activity in a promoter-reporter assay setting. third, comparison of target gene expression levels in cells transfected with sirnas against specific smad proteins, or against a tf predicted to be a smad co-regulator, or against both, can reveal if there is any synergistic action between the two interacting partners.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have identified  <dig> tgf-β/smad targets by microarray experiments coupled with bioinformatics. further computational analysis using cart and rf modeling has identified several transcription factor modules and provided important information in the transcriptional control of tgf-β/smad signaling. guided by this computational information, experiments are underway to verify these co-regulator modules in normal and aberrant conditions such as ovarian cancer, a disease in which dysregulation of tgf-β/smad signaling has recently been demonstrated  <cit> .
