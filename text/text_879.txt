BACKGROUND
mitochondria have evolved from eubacterial endosymbionts related to the Î±-proteobacteria  <cit> . the primitive state for the mitochondrial genome probably resembled that found in the protozoan reclinomonas americana, which has a  <dig>  bp genome which still retains eubacterial features of genome organisation such as operons  <cit> . during their evolutionary history, many mitochondrial genomes have been reduced in size, having lost many genes, some of which have been transferred to the nucleus. as a result, mitochondrial genomes vary widely in size and structure amongst animals, plants, fungi and protists. within the metazoa, however, mitochondrial genomes show surprising conservation of size and composition  <cit> , almost invariably containing  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> ribosomal genes and  <dig> trnas, necessary for the transcription of the mitochondrially encoded genes. the order of those genes on the mitochondrial genome differs widely among the metazoan phyla, but can also show surprising conservation in organisation within specific metazoan clades, such as the vertebrata  <cit>  and the ecdysozoa  <cit> . this striking conservation in gene order and composition observed between certain animal phyla is considered too complex to have arisen in any way other than by common ancestry and can be a powerful tool for resolving animal relationships. breakpoint and maximum parsimony analyses have revealed phylogenetic signal derived from the mitochondrial gene order allowing inference of evolutionary relationships among the metazoan phyla, and support aspects of the new animal phylogeny   <cit> .

the deuterostomes are a monophyletic group of animals comprised of the chordates , the echinoderms, the hemichordates and the recently included xenoturbellids  <cit> . previous morphological studies suggest alternative placements for xenoturbella, as a basal bilaterian  <cit> , a turbellarian flatworm  <cit> , a sister group to the echinoderms or hemichordates  <cit>  or a bivalve mollusc  <cit> . recent molecular studies based primarily on nuclear genes seem to favour a placement as a sister group to the ambulacraria   <cit> . conversely, mitochondrial sequences support a basal deuterostome position  <cit> , but when amino acids with a different genetic code are excluded, xenoturbella was recovered as basal ambulacrarian  <cit> .

traditional evolutionary morphological hypotheses united the deuterostome phyla  on the basis of radial cleavage of the embryo and of deuterostomy, in which the anus rather than the mouth develops from the blastopore during early embryonic development. this grouping has largely remained robust to molecular phylogenetic analyses , as opposed to the protostomes in which many groupings based on morphological similarities have not been supported by molecular data. current molecular phylogenetic analyses place the echinoderms and the hemichordates together in a group called the ambulacraria, and the chordates  as their monophyletic sister group  <cit> .

phylogenetic studies of 18s rrna sequences, expressed sequence tags  and mitochondrial genome data have all suggested that the benthic marine worm xenoturbella is placed in its own phylum, at the base of the ambulacraria  <cit> . this is somewhat surprising in morphological terms, as xenoturbella has no coelomic cavities, nor a through gut as in all the other members of the deuterostomes. it also has no other organs, no visible gonads nor centralized nervous system  <cit> . the most obvious explanation for this apparent simplicity might be that this animal is highly derived, and secondarily simplified. other members of the deuterostome group, such as the echinoderms, can also be described as highly morphologically derived: they have a unique five-fold symmetry while all other deuterostomes are bilaterally symmetrical. all extant echinoderms also lack gill slits  <cit> . in addition to their highly derived morphology, the mitochondrial genomes of echinoderms are fast evolving and their gene order and genetic code varies both within and between echinoderm classes  <cit> . in contrast, and rather strikingly, the mitochondrial genomes of the vertebrates, hemichordates and xenoturbella bocki are very similar in their gene order  <cit> . this conserved mitochondrial arrangement in  <dig> out of  <dig> deuterostome phyla is an indication that it is likely to represent the ancestral state of the deuterostome mitochondrial gene arrangement. amongst the protostomes and diploblasts, mitochondrial gene orders appear to be significantly more variable  <cit> . another study of xenoturbella's mitochondrial genome suggested that this conserved gene arrangement supports a basal position for xenoturbella within the deuterostomes, and possibly among the bilateria  <cit> . but until suitably conserved outgroups are found at the base of the bilateria, it will be difficult to infer the ancestral bilaterian mitochondrial gene order. recent advances in metazoan phylogenomics  <cit> , will no doubt help in finding suitable outgroups at the base of the bilateria for comparison. the full mitochondrial genomes of acoels and nemertodermatids, two phyla thought to be the most basal bilateria, will be of particular interest in determining the composition of the ancestral bilaterian mitochondrial gene order. partial mitochondrial genome sequences for the nemertodermatid nemertoderma westbladi and the acoel paratomella rubra already indicate that the gene order in these groups is quite divergent from the ancestral deuterostome arrangement, and bears no similarity to that of other metazoan groups  <cit> .

an interesting feature of mitochondrial dna  is the control region, which is involved in transcription and replication of the heavy  strand and mayform a stable stem-loop structure  <cit> . the control region is called the d-loop region in vertebrates and its name comes from the nascent heavy  strand that displaces the parental h strand and forms a typical d shaped structure  <cit> . conserved structural features in the control region of mtdna have been used in evolutionary studies  <cit>  and have been extensively characterised in vertebrates  <cit> , providing a useful comparison point to the non-vertebrate deuterostome groups including xenoturbella.

mitochondrial dna primary sequences have also been extensively used for the inference of metazoan phylogeny, in particular in mammals and other deuterostome groups  <cit> . however, phylogenetic inference from mitochondrial sequences may be complicated by a number of misleading factors such as compositional heterogeneity  <cit> , strand asymmetry  <cit>  and accelerated substitution rates, which violate the assumptions of the commonly used models of evolution. a useful approach to overcome these problems is to improve the models of evolution used to infer phylogeny from these sequences. in particular more reliable empirical replacement matrices  <cit> , and models that account for heterogeneities across sites  <cit>  and among lineages  <cit>  may significantly improve the fit of data to the model and therefore provide more reliable phylogenetic estimates.

in this study, we describe the gene order, composition and non-coding regions of the mitochondrial genome of xenoturbella bocki. we infer the ancestral state of the mitochondrial gene order in the deuterostome common ancestor. using breakpoint and inversion analysis, we test conflicting hypotheses of xenoturbella's phylogenetic position in a tree of the metazoa and finally we use more sophisticated models of amino acid substitution to infer the phylogenetic position of xenoturbella using mitochondrial amino acid sequence data.

RESULTS
mitochondrial genome structure
the mitochondrial genome of xenoturbella bocki is a  <dig>  bp circular dna molecule, and has an a+t content of  <dig> %. as in most other bilaterian mitochondrial genomes, there are  <dig> protein coding genes,  <dig> transfer rnas and  <dig> ribosomal rnas . atg is used as a start codon for all of the protein coding genes, except cox <dig>  which starts with gtg. atp <dig>  cox <dig>  nd <dig> and nd <dig> end on ta and cox <dig> on t, while all other genes end on the usual taa. these attenuated stop codons are presumably completed by polyadenylation  <cit>  .

the gene order of the xenoturbella bocki mitochondrial genome is shown in figure  <dig>  within the deuterostome group, the gene order of xenoturbella bocki is most similar to that of the conserved vertebrate gene order as well as the hemichordate balanoglossus carnosus, which has virtually the same gene order as the vertebrates  <cit> . in xenoturbella, balanoglossus and the vertebrates all protein coding genes follow the same order on the plus strand except for the control region and -nd <dig>  the only protein coding gene on the minus strand. in the remaining deuterostome phyla, the echinoderms and the urochordates, the gene orders are very different, and vary extensively even amongst the echinoderm classes  <cit>  . given that the echinoderm lineage is very derived, and considering the phylogenetic position of xenoturbella as a separate phylum at the base of ambulacraria  <cit> , it is likely that the vertebrate/hemichordate/xenoturbella arrangement represents the ancestral gene order for the deuterostome clade.

there are few gaps between the genes, except for a  <dig> bp gap between trne and nd <dig> and a  <dig> bp gap between trnl and -nd <dig>  which is likely to correspond to the control region for the heavy  strand and presumably forms a hairpin loop . there are a number of gene overlaps, the most significant being a  <dig> bp overlap between the end of atp <dig> and the start of atp <dig> on the same strand but translated in different reading frames . atp <dig> and atp <dig> also overlap in other metazoans, and are probably transcribed together. another  <dig> bp overlap is present between the end of nd4l and the start of nd <dig>  this overlap is also present in the vertebrate, hagfish, and saccoglossus kowalevskii mitochondrial genomes. even though these genes are adjacent in the cephalochordates branchiostoma sp. and epigonichthys sp., and in the hemichordate balanoglossus carnosus, there is no overlap. in the more derived echinoderm and urochordate mitochondrial genomes, these genes are not adjacent. the proximity of these genes in xenoturbella, hemichordata, vertebrata and cephalochordata indicates that these genes may have been adjacent in the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrion although it does not allow us to know whether they overlapped or not. the presence of this  <dig> bp overlap between the end of nd4l and the start of nd <dig> in other phyla outside the deuterostomes  indicates that this is likely to be an ancestral feature of bilterian genomes.

there are a number of overlaps in the genes coding for trnas: trnh overlaps with trns <dig> by  <dig> bp and trns <dig> overlaps with nd <dig> by  <dig> bp. other trna genes which appear to be overlapping by  <dig> to  <dig> bp at the 3' end with another gene or trna may in fact be lacking these bases. the overlapping base is in all cases an a and could be later added to the trna by polyadenylation  <cit> .

genetic code changes
shared mitochondrial genetic codes changes between phyla are rare and complex events and can be used to infer common ancestry  <cit> .xenoturbella bocki has the standard invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code. it does not share the ata codon change from methionine  to isoleucine  found in echinoderms and hemichordates. there is one further genetic code change found in echinoderms: aaa codes for asparagine  instead of lysine   <cit> . in the hemichordate balanoglossus carnosus, the codon aaa is absent however aaa codes for lysine in saccoglossus and this is therefore an echinoderm specific change  <cit> . in xenoturbella bocki, the aaa codon codes for lysine as in most other invertebrates . the genetic coding of ata = i shared by echinoderms and hemichordates is an ambulacrarian synapomorphy that is lacking in xenoturbella and suggests that xenoturbellida represents an independent lineage outside of the ambulacraria.

reconstructing the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrial gene order
by comparing the gene boundaries found in the mitochondrial genomes of xenoturbella bocki, hemichordata , vertebrata , cephalochordata  and echinodermata , we inferred the ancestral deuterostome mitochondrial gene order .

we find that in xenoturbella and the two hemichordates, saccoglossus kowalevskii and balanoglossus carnosus, nd <dig> and cob are adjacent. while the nd <dig>  cob gene boundary is common to xenoturbella and the hemichordates, the final location of nd6/trne  is different in the two clades suggesting this could be a parallel change. alternatively, there could have been an additional translocation event in the lineage leading to xenoturbella. if the nd <dig>  -nd <dig>  trne, cob gene order found in non-avian vertebrates is to represent the ancestral state, the nd <dig>  -nd <dig>  cob gene arrangement found in  <dig> out of  <dig> of the sequenced echinoderm mitochondrial genomes could represent an intermediate step in the lineage leading to the xenoturbella and hemichordate gene order . more mitochondrial genomes within the hemichordates and especially from the basal pterobranch hemichordates will allow us to establish whether the nd <dig>  -nd <dig>  cob arrangement or nd <dig>  cob represents the ancestral state.

gene rearrangements have been shown to be more prevalent around the control region, indicating that certain constraints operate on mitochondrial rearrangements, and the proximity of nd <dig>  nd <dig> and cob to the control region may have resulted in convergent gene translocations. interestingly, the nd <dig>  cob gene order is also found in birds  <cit> , probably through a convergent change.

to reconstruct the gene order of the deuterostome common ancestor , we used parsimony reconstruction, based on comparisons of the genomes of xenoturbella bocki, balanoglossus carnosus, saccoglossus kowalevskii, branchiostoma floridae, the conserved non avian-vertebrate gene order, and the crinoid gymnocrinus richeri, a basal echinoderm  <cit> . where a consensus could not be reached, the primitive state was determined by looking at mitochondrial genomes within the protostomes. minimum breakpoint reconstruction of the mitochondrial gene order for the ancestor of all bilaterians shows that this gene order is virtually identical to that inferred by us for the deuterostome ancestor, with a few differences in the position of trnas  <cit> . it has previously been argued that this ancestral gene order might be uninformative in terms of making assumptions about deuterostome monophyly, or even about xenoturbella deuterostome affinities  <cit> . to test this assertion, we compared the relative scores obtained by breakpoint and inversion analysis of alternative positions of xenoturbella among the bilateria by using a large set of metazoan mitochondrial genomes including a large number of deuterostomes.

inversion and breakpoint analysis
to test alternative hypotheses of xenoturbella's phylogenetic position using gene order data, we used constrained trees based on  <dig> mitochondrial genomes including  <dig> echinoderms,  <dig> hemichordates,  <dig> urochordates,  <dig> ecdysozoans and  <dig> lophotrochozoans  and calculated breakpoint scores  and inversion scores  for  <dig> alternative placements of xenoturbella bocki .

based on gene order alone, the most parsimonious position for xenoturbella is as a basal hemichordate . placing xenoturbella in this position results in an inversion median score of  <dig>  and a breakpoint score of  <dig> . it is of note that another placement of xenoturbella  receives the same inversion score. however, the inversion score is calculated under the assumption that inversions are the only process underlying mitochondrial genome rearrangements, which is unlikely to be true. given that the breakpoint score does not rely on this assumption, it is likely to represent a slightly better estimate of distances between mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . it seems sensible therefore to place more weight on the breakpoint than on the inversion score. on this basis, we conclude that gene order evidence favours the phylogenetic placement of xenoturbella as sister group of the hemichordates.

lower scores are better. best scores are shown in bold.

analysis of non-coding regions and transcription initiation sites
in vertebrates, each mitochondrial dna strand  has its own control region, which forms a stable stem-loop structure  <cit> . the main portion of mitochondrial dna involved in transcription and replication of the heavy  strand in vertebrates is called the d-loop region and has been well characterised  <cit> . the vertebrate d-loop region typically lies between trnp and trnf and is divided into three main domains: extended termination-associated sequences , central domain  and conserved sequence block , each of them carrying particular conserved functional motifs and often repeats. the etas region may contain a number of repeats containing termination associated sequences , tacat elements, associated with premature termination of the replication cycle  <cit> .

the origin of replication of the light strand  is normally between trnn and trnc in vertebrates and it also forms a typical stem loop structure. in the stem region of the ol, the trinucleotide 5'-cgg-3' is considered the initiation site for light strand replication in the mouse  <cit> . the loop is usually c/t-rich as it seems that pyrimidine stretches are required for the initiation of l-strand replication by an rna primase  <cit> .

the putative xenoturbella bocki control region is a  <dig> bp stretch between trnl and -nd <dig>  the xenoturbella control region is noticeably a+t rich . as a way of comparison, 3rd codon positions of the protein coding genes, which have low structural constraints due to the redundancy of the genetic code and tend to reflect the mutational pressure acting on the genome, are clearly less a+t rich . this implies a weak structural constraint acting on the control region, even lower than that acting on the 3rd codon position or even a positive selection for a+t. this may suggest that only a small fraction of the control region  is under stabilising selective positive pressure.

another intriguing aspect is that the xenoturbella control region is not strand asymmetric with respect to g and c  while the rest of the genome is clearly gc skewed . mitochondrial genomes usually tend to become asymmetric towards g and c because one strand remains single stranded for longer compared to the other  <cit> . the lack of asymmetry in the control region of xenoturbella may suggest that this region is permanently maintained in a double stranded condition. vertebrates, hemichordates and crinoids show a significant gc asymmetry in their control region  <cit> , while basal chordates such as cephalochordates and most of the ambulacraria, groups that have shorter control regions than in xenoturbella, have a very low gc asymmetry . the xenoturbella control region contains a number of other interesting features.

the 5' end  and the central part of the control region are particularly at enriched and characterised by a very low complexity. however, between positions  <dig> to  <dig> we could identify two  <dig> nucleotide tandem repeat sequences . interestingly, these sequences contain putative tas elements. the similarity with vertebrate tas elements is rather convincing if we consider that these elements are generally found in repeated sequences and are only located at one extremity of the d-loop region in vertebrates . we have looked for the same tas elements in other putative ambulacrarian control regions, but we could not find any. a portion of this repeat is palindromic and capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure , which may help in the termination of replication  <cit> .

we were also able to detect a putative binding site for mttfa, the main mitochondrial transcription factor in vertebrates. the binding site consists of a pair of palindromic sequences that are located between positions  <dig>  and  <dig>  the consensus for the  <dig> xenoturbella binding sites can be seen in figure 2c and is almost identical to the consensus found in xenopus  <cit> . it is also possible to identify another pair of putative binding sites at position  <dig> which partially overlap, rather than being separated by a 0â <dig> nucleotide gap, as expected in a binding site for multimeric dna binding factors. however these putative binding sites have to be considered highly significant, as considering the xenoturbella d-loop region nucleotide frequencies, we expect to find one every  <dig>  nucleotides by chance.

perhaps the most striking feature of the putative xenoturbella d-loop is the presence of two  <dig> nucleotide long palindromic repeats . these repeats are almost identical and are able to form a very stable  stem loop structure, characterised by a short t-rich internal loop . we were unable to find stem loops of this size in other ambulacrarian or chordate d-loop regions. however, a portion of this stem has a striking similarity with the stem region of the light strand origin of replication  of vertebrates. in figure 2d we have aligned the ol for different vertebrate species from human to an actinopterigyan fish . as can be seen, a portion of xenoturbella stem is clearly alignable with the ol stem of vertebrates, although we have had to reverse the sequence of the stems before alignment. statistically, the consensus sequence for the vertebrate ol stem is expected to be found once in every million base pairs in the xenoturbella genome; consequently it is unlikely that this similarity is a coincidence. we have looked for the consensus of this alignment in other ambulacrarians, urochordates and cephalochordates but could not find any similar sequence.

we were unable to identify any conserved sequence blocks  in the xenoturbella non-coding region. these have been found in basal cephalochordates  <cit>  but not in urochordates  <cit> . we also could not find any significant g stretches followed by at dinucleotides as reported to be present in some echinoderms and in hemichordates  <cit> .

we have detected features that are typical of vertebrate mitochondrial control regions, such as two putative termination associated sequences , binding sites for mttfa and a significant similarity between the stem of the major stem loop structure of xenoturbella and the stem of the vertebrates ol. these findings imply that the replication and transcription system of xenoturbella may be more similar to the one found in chordates than to that of ambulacraria, suggesting that commonalities of xenoturbella and vertebrates may represent the ancestral state.

phylogenetic analyses
we have performed various phylogenetic analyses using the  <dig> concatenated mitochondrial proteins from  <dig> deuterostome species plus  <dig> outgroups. perseke and colleagues reported that under certain analytical conditions xenoturbella unexpectedly groups with the acoelomorph paratomella rubra  <cit>  among basal bilaterians and suggested that this may be correlated with the long branch leading to the acoelomorph. in order to evaluate this, and to test further any possible affinity of xenoturbella with basal bilaterians we have analyzed the affinities of the acoelomorph in the presence and absence of the urochordates, which are characterised by accelerated substitution rates and therefore useful for the diagnosis of long branch artefacts . our results show that in the absence of the long branched urochordates, the acoelomorph is basal to all other bilaterians , while xenoturbella is recovered within the deuterostomes . in the presence of the urochordates, the acoelomorph is strongly associated with the urochordates  in a deuterostome clade, but not with xenoturbella. these findings suggest that the acoelomorph is genuinely subject to lba and consequently the reported relationship with xenoturbella in a basal bilaterian position is likely to be the effect of an artefact. in the light of this, we have excluded the acoelomorph from subsequent analyses, but kept the problematic urochordates as an internal diagnostic of the ability of different models to fit the dataset accurately and avoid long branch artefacts.

we have run subsequent analyses of the mitochondrial dataset using optimal models of amino acid evolution. using mrbayes and the mechanistic gtr model we analysed amino acids recoded into  <dig> functional categories, as this has been shown to be a helpful approach when dealing with problematic phylogenies . we have also analyzed standard  <dig> character state amino acid sequences using two new empirical models of evolution, mtzoa and mthydro, which we have implemented ourselves in mrbayes. the two models, in particular mthydro, fit many mitochondrial datasets and in particular deuterostome datasets, better than mtrev ,  <cit>  . we have also used the cat model, implemented in phylobayes  <cit> , which accounts for across site heterogeneities in the amino-acid replacement process and cat-bp, implemented in nhphylobayes  <cit> . these two models, in particular cat-bp, have been shown to give an invaluable improvement in the case of compositionally heterogeneous datasets such as the mitogenomic one  <cit> .

our results show that trees obtained using mrbayes consistently support a basal deuterostome position for xenoturbella  in accordance with perseke and colleagues  <cit> . this hypothesis is strongly supported by using the  <dig> amino acid functional recoding , while, interestingly, using mtzoa  and mthydro  the support decreases. in all the tree analyses the urochordates branch with the long branched outgroups, but support for this decreases from using the  <dig> functional categories  to mtzoa  and mthydro . we suggest that urochordates may be used here as an internal diagnostic of how the models fit the dataset. we suggest that as the model tends to escape a "wrong" urochordate position , the better the model fits the dataset and reduces the amount of false phylogenetic signal. interestingly the decrease in support for urochordates+outgroup in the three models  is proportional to the decrease in support for a basal deuterostome position for xenoturbella .

using phylobayes and modelling protein evolution with the cat model  <cit> , xenoturbella is still recovered as a basal deuterostome, but with low support  and the urochordates are recovered as deuterostomes with high support , even if within paraphyletic echinoderms, rather than with the chordates. using cat-bp  <cit> , which accounts for compositional heterogeneity within lineages, the urochordates are finally recovered as basal chordates, even if with tepid support  . interestingly, using cat-bp the position of xenoturbella is unresolved, implying that signal supporting a basal deuterostome position for xenoturbella finally decreases to below 50%.

the ability of a model to handle problematic taxa, such as the urochordates, is a clear indication that this model fits the dataset well. the overall scenario of our tree searches suggests that the better the model is able to cope with the problematic urochordates, the weaker the support for xenoturbella as basal deuterostome. our tentative conclusion is that more adequate models recognise the apparent signal placing xenoturbella in a basal deuterostome position as false, leaving the tree topology unresolved by mitochondrial gene sequences. we finally compared three competing tree topologies using the au test and implementing the mtzoa model. results indicate that the favoured tree topology is that of xenoturbella as basal deuterostome . however, a position as a basal ambulacrarian  is not rejected and has a p value of  <dig> , much higher than the threshold for rejection that is  <dig> . as a way of comparison, a basal chordate position for xenoturbella is rejected at a level of  <dig> .

previous phylogenetic analyses based on the small ribosomal subunit  <cit>  and large est datasets  <cit>  support a position of xenoturbella as a basal ambulacrarian. the basal deuterostome position obtained with the mitochondrial dataset using different models possibly reflects the compositional bias coming from mitochondrial genetic code changes in the lineage leading to ambulacraria. when these amino acids  with a different genetic code in ambulacrarian mitochondrial genomes are excluded from the analyses, xenoturbella is recovered as a basal ambulacrarian  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
comparative analyses of the mitochondrial genome structure of xenoturbella bocki with those of other deuterostomes and bilaterians have revealed a number of characteristics linking it to the deuterostome clade. although the xenoturbella mitochondrial gene order is very conserved and resembles the gene order found in the deuterostome ancestor , breakpoint and inversion scores have revealed a closer similarity to the hemichordates. additionally, analyses of transcription and replication initiation sites in the control region show a number of domains typical of vertebrate mitochondrial control regions. together these results suggest that even though xenoturbella seems morphologically derived within the deuterostomes , many structural and organisational aspects of its mitochondrial genome appear to be ancestral for the deuterostome group.

finally, while standard phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences support a basal deuterostome placement, the use of more sophisticated models of sequence evolution, specifically designed to counteract obvious systematic biases such as the known changes in genetic code amongst the deuterostomes, show decreasing support for this placement. we conclude that the mitochondrial genome sequence cannot be used to contradict the results derived from the much more comprehensive datasets of nuclear proteins and ribosomal rnas which consistently show that xenoturbella is the sister group of the ambulacraria.
