BACKGROUND
the parasitic lifestyle has evolved repeatedly in nearly every major lineage of life, and in the broad sense includes brood parasitism, social parasitism, genomic parasitism, and nutritional parasitism  <cit> . among plants, nutritional parasites obtain water and nutrients directly from their photosynthetic host plant through a specialized feeding structure, the haustorium, which is attached to either host shoots or roots  <cit> . these plants include both hemiparasites  and holoparasites   <cit> . while both hemi- and some holoparasites grow largely exterior to the host, certain holoparasites grow nearly completely embedded within the host plant tissues as endoparasites, emerging only during sexual reproduction  <cit> . though most parasites can be classified according to their photosynthetic status and the nature of their interactions with their hosts, insight into the evolution of parasitic traits has been hampered by the lack of a broad phylogenetic perspective.

the parasitic lifestyle is thought to have evolved  <dig>  <cit>  to  <dig>  <cit>  times in flowering plants, but comprehensive phylogenetic analyses have never been performed to investigate the evolutionary frequency and pattern of the shift to heterotrophy in angiosperms. the lack of a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for parasitic angiosperms has also hampered studies of genome evolution  <cit>  and the inference of ancestral conditions that may have promoted the evolution of the haustorial parasitic lifestyle. furthermore, although considerable progress has been made towards the molecular systematics of many parasitic plants  <cit> , several parasites have obscure positions within angiosperm phylogeny, accounting for  <dig> of  <dig> unplaced taxa in the recent molecularly-based ordinal classification of flowering plants  <cit> .

classifying parasitic plants using morphological characters has long been difficult because of the extreme reduction or alteration of vegetative and floral morphology that occurs in holoparasitic lineages  <cit> . the primary challenge associated with inferring the phylogenetic placement of many parasites using molecular data in a global angiosperm context is spurious long-branch attraction  <cit>  caused by their highly divergent dna sequences  <cit> . furthermore, the apparent loss of photosynthetic and other genes that have been commonly used to study flowering plant phylogeny  <cit>  has prevented the inclusion of many parasites in otherwise comprehensive studies  <cit> . a possible solution to these phylogenetic problems is through the study of plant mtdna, which is retained regardless of photosynthetic ability and has proven useful for determining the phylogenetic affinities of some parasitic plants  <cit> . to infer the number of origins and distribution of parasitism in a global angiosperm phylogenetic context we used three mtdna genes:atp <dig>  coxi, and matr.

while mtdna may offer several advantages for the study of parasitic plants, its use necessitates careful consideration of the possibility of horizontal gene transfer   <cit> . of particular relevance to our study are reports that mitochondrial genes may be horizontally transferred between hosts and parasites  <cit> . also, the invasive mitochondrial coxi group i intron  has been independently, horizontally acquired from unknown vectors in various flowering plants  <cit> . one consequence of such transfers is that parasites may appear closely related to their hosts, thereby obscuring their true phylogenies; however, if such occurrences are relatively uncommon, the majority of loci should correctly predict the phylogenetic positions of most parasites. our multigene approach coupled with broad angiosperm ordinal sampling will allow us to estimate the number of parasitic plant origins in flowering plant phylogeny, interpret potential horizontal transfers of foreign mtdna into parasitic plant genomes and discern whether parasites are more likely to horizontally acquire dna than non-parasites.

RESULTS
phylogenetic placement of parasites
analyses of combined atp <dig>  coxi, and matr sequence data  were undertaken because initial single gene analyses showed that there were no strongly supported conflicting nodes between trees estimated from separate datasets . maximum likelihood analyses of the  <dig> gene combined dataset resulted in a single best tree  that represents the first molecular phylogenetic placement of all parasitic lineages within a global angiosperm context . this mtdna phylogenetic tree shows largely congruent relationships among non-parasitic angiosperms compared to independent analyses of chloroplast and nuclear sequence data  <cit> . highly supported placements were obtained for nine parasite lineages that corroborate earlier focussed studies: hydnoraceae with piperales   <cit> , cassytha with laurales   <cit> , cuscuta with solanales   <cit> , orobanchaceae with lamiales   <cit> , lennoaceae with boraginaceae   <cit> , mitrastemonaceae with ericales   <cit> , cytinaceae with malvales   <cit> , krameriaceae with zygophyllaceae   <cit> , and rafflesiaceae with malpighiales   <cit>  . lesser support was obtained for balanophoraceae with santalales   and apodanthaceae with cucurbitales , although an apodanthaceae + cucurbitales relationship is further supported by a unique shared  <dig> bp  insertion at bp  <dig> in matr . combined analyses were entirely unclear about the placement of cynomorium; however, sequence data of matr-alone suggest this parasite is related to saxifragales , in agreement with previous analyses  <cit> . in contrast, combined atp <dig> and coxi analyses support a placement of cynomorium with sapindales .

within this phylogenetic framework, it appears that haustorial parasitism has arisen at least  <dig> independent times as indicated by the orange  and red  branches . it is not clear whether parasitism arose once in the ancestor of balanophoraceae + santalales or if the parasitic lifestyle independently evolved in the two lineages because the earliest diverging branches of santalales are not parasitic and it is unlikely that parasitism is a reversible trait  <cit> . thus, it is possible that there are actually  <dig> origins of parasitism implied by this tree . because some parasite phylogenetic positions did not receive high bootstrap support, we attempted to discern whether a hypothesis of fewer than  <dig> origins of parasitism could be rejected. trees that constrained apodanthaceae + cynomoriaceae + santalales + balanophoraceae to be monophyletic in any of the three positions shown in fig.  <dig> were rejected by the s-h test as significantly worse than the unconstrained tree of fig.  <dig> . trees that constrained the position of apodanthaceae as sister to cynomoriaceae or santalales were significantly worse than the optimal tree of fig.  <dig> . trees constraining the position of santalales + balanophoraceae with apodanthaceae were significantly worse than the optimal tree  while a position sister to cynomoriaceae could not be rejected. finally, trees that constrained the position of cynomoriaceae-only to be sister to either apodanthaceae or santalales + balanophoraceae were not significantly different from the optimal tree shown in fig.  <dig>  thus, these data suggest that there were as few as  <dig>  or as many as  <dig>  origins of parasitism in angiosperm evolutionary history.

the phylogenetic tree shown in fig.  <dig> also reveals a surprising feature of parasite evolution: endoparasitism has arisen in four independent lineages. these four lineages, marked by an "e" in figure  <dig>  include apodanthaceae, rafflesiaceae, cytinaceae, and mitrastemonaceae . because these four endoparasite families have traditionally been included in rafflesiaceae it was previously assumed that endoparasitism was uniquely derived  <cit> , although several recent studies have shown that these families are not closely related  <cit> . figure  <dig> clearly indicates that the endoparasites are not monophyletic. in fact, trees that constrained the endoparasite clade to be monophyletic in any of the four positions shown in fig.  <dig> were rejected by the s-h test as significantly worse than the unconstrained tree of fig.  <dig> .

putative horizontal transfer of atp1
because of unexpected phylogenetic relationships noted in preliminary analyses of atp <dig> , single gene studies using one representative for each rosid and asterid order, together with the four endoparasites, were performed. figure  <dig> shows that analyses of atp1-alone suggest all four endoparasite lineages are closely related to their primary host lineages: pilostyles  with pisum + psorothamnus , rafflesia + rhizanthes with vitis + tetrastigma , cytinus with helianthemum , and mitrastema + quercus  with fagus  . although node-specific support for these parasite + host plant sister relationships is not high in most cases, it is extremely unlikely that they would all independently be related to their hosts by chance alone. in all of these parasites, atp <dig> has an intact open-reading frame and we have never found any evidence for additional copies of the gene using pcr. these results could indicate that all of these endoparasites are closely related to their primary host lineages; however, the matr and coxi single gene analyses , the combined three gene analyses , as well as recent studies  <cit>  suggest otherwise for pilostyles, rafflesia + rhizanthes, and mitrastema. in contrast, cytinus does indeed appear to be related to malvales with all three genes analyzed here . host plant contamination cannot explain the results for atp <dig> because, in all cases, replication of our methods produced identical results and comparisons of sequences from the parasites to the host individuals from which they were collected, revealed numerous differences . rather, these results suggest a different history for atp <dig> as compared to coxi and matr in pilostyles, rafflesia + rhizanthes, and mitrastema, most likely caused by historical horizontal gene transfer  from their hosts. conflicting histories for atp <dig> relative to matr + coxi in these parasites are also inferred from statistically significant s-h test results that compared the unconstrained tree in fig 3a to one which constrained the positions of the endoparasites to those of fig.  <dig> . however, when each parasite was analyzed singly, only the position of mitrastema was statistically significant . furthermore, corrected pairwise divergences  and estimated branch lengths indicate substantial disparities in the level of divergence of atp <dig> compared to coxi and matr in these parasites relative to non-parasites . specifically, levels of sequence divergence and branch lengths for coxi and matr in pilostyles are ca. 4– <dig> times higher than in non-parasitic plants. however, in stark contrast, the level of sequence divergence for atp <dig> is indistinguishable between pilostyles and non-parasites. this disparate pattern is also detectable to a lesser extent in rafflesia, rhizanthes, and mitrastema. this observation is consistent with the expectation that recently transferred xenologous atp <dig> genes should be less divergent than native sequences that have resided for longer periods of time in the rapidly evolving parasitic plant genomes.

to investigate whether the putatively horizontally transferred sequences are expressed and rna edited in any of the endoparasites, we performed rt-pcr from rafflesia cantleyi floral rna and compared the atp <dig> cdna sequence to the dna sequence from the same individual. figure  <dig> shows that not only was cdna obtained from the rafflesia rna, suggesting that atp <dig> is expressed, it appears that the rna undergoes editing because of the observed t at position  <dig> in the cdna relative to c in the same position of the dna sequence. this result is consistent with a c to u edit at this site in the transcript. the fact that the atp <dig> transcript is edited suggests that it is transcribed in the mitochondrion of this species. this edit site is at a nonsynonymous, first codon position that results in the encoding of serine rather than proline. this rna edit site has not been reported for other species  <cit> .

when comparing the atp <dig> sequences of two accessions of pilostyles thurberi , we noted that the two sequences differed at ten sites. this is a surprisingly large number of differences considering these are accessions of the same species and that the mutation rate of mitochondrial dna in plants is typically very low  <cit>  . eight of the differences were restricted to the central region of the gene. in contrast, comparisons of atp <dig> from pilostyles  to the host psorothamnus individual it was collected from, revealed that the two species were identical for  <dig> bp in the central region of the gene, but have a disproportionate  <dig> differences at the 5' and 3' ends. because the pilostyles  sequence was obtained in multiple pcr amplifications from independent samples, the result is not likely explained by pcr-mediated recombination. instead, we hypothesized that pilostyles  atp <dig> may represent a chimeric xenolog that is the result of multiple historical horizontal gene transfer events from its hosts. to investigate this possibility, we performed gene conversion analyses that detected an  <dig> bp region of pilostyles   that appears to have been converted by its current host sequence . separate phylogenetic analyses of the two regions including multiple members of fabales reinforced the hypothesis of a different history for these two regions as well. regions i of atp <dig> show that the two pilostyles sequences are nested within fabales and are most closely related to the caesalpinioid legume, gleditsia , whereas the putatively, recently converted region ii shows that pilostyles  is most closely related to its current faboid host, psorothamnus . interestingly, the region ii tree also suggests that pilostyles  may have independently horizontally acquired atp <dig> multiple times as well, perhaps recently from its modern host, a species of dalea . an s-h test suggested that the tree estimated from the putatively converted region  is statistically incongruent with the data of the adjacent 5' and 3' regions   and vice versa .

coxi intron acquisition in parasitic plants
a final striking and unexpected observation of mtdna sequence variation is that the mt coxi gene in nearly every parasitic lineage has been invaded by a group i intron . the only sampled parasitic plants lacking introns are krameria and schoepfia, both hemiparasites; all other sampled hemiparasites and all holoparasites possess the intron. multiple independent invasions and rampant horizontal transfer of this intron in angiosperms has been previously reported  <cit> ; however, no correlation to life history, biogeography or phylogeny was found. yet, it appears that there is a correlation between the evolution of parasitism and the presence of the coxi intron. the probability of observing  <dig> gains and  <dig> losses of parasitism on branches with the coxi intron as reconstructed on the tree shown in fig.  <dig> is very low . however, to avoid potential bias due to our exhaustive sampling of parasite lineages, we investigated this question further at the ordinal level. based on our data shown in fig.  <dig> and literature reports  <cit> , more than  <dig> species of plants from all monophyletic orders of flowering plants  have been surveyed for the intron. using this innformation, we assigned intron presence or absence to every order, as well as  <dig> families that are not currently placed in an order  . out of the  <dig> orders that we have scored as intron negative,  <dig> have had at least half of the included families sampled for the coxi intron . assuming this tree representing relationships among all orders of angiosperms, the probability of observing  <dig> gains and  <dig> losses of parasitism is <  <dig> . however, because we have sampled less than half of the included families from oxalidales, brassicales, myrtales, asterales, liliales, asparagales, poales, and pandanales, we investigated the effect of re-scoring these orders as intron positive on the observed correlation. even in this case, the probability of observing  <dig> gains and  <dig> losses of parasitism is <  <dig> . the results are quantitatively similar regardless if we use acctran or deltran to resolve equivocal ancestral states or if we resolve the polytomous relationships presented in  <cit>  differently from what is shown.

one hypothesis for the apparent association of parasitism and the coxi intron is that the parasites have horizontally acquired the intron from their current hosts. this hypothesis is not supported by our data because in cases where the parasite is highly host-specific, the host lineages do not have an intron. for example, rafflesia and rhizanthes only parasitize tetrastigma , yet this genus  does not have an intron, and there is no evidence that it ever had one, as indicated by the lack of intron co-conversion sites  <cit> . in other cases, such as cuscuta and orobanchaceae, the parasite introns are closely related to intron sequences of close non-parasitic relatives and thus appear to have been transmitted vertically from non-parasitic ancestors . overall, the intron phylogeny is highly discordant with angiosperm phylogeny as indicated by a significant s-h test comparing the optimal tree to one that constrains asterids rosids, orders, and families of plants to be monophyletic . this results corroborates earlier findings  <cit>  of widespread hgt of this mobile sequence .

discussion
phylogenetic aspects of parasitism
the pattern of evolution of haustorial parasitism in angiosperms is striking in several regards. first, it appears that parasitism has evolved repeatedly in many major groups of flowering plants from magnoliids to derived eudicot lineages, and most of these lineages  now consist entirely of nonphotosynthetic parasites. however, monocots, campanulids, and caryophyllids  have never evolved parasitism or else retain no extant parasitic representatives. in contrast, within lamiids alone , parasitism has independently evolved  <dig> times including both shoot  and root  parasites, although this may not be statistically different from zero. why some lineages have a propensity to become parasitic is not clear; however, the strong correlation of the distribution of the coxi intron  with the independent origins of parasitism  is tantalizing and will be discussed below. second, the highly specialized trait of endoparasitism  <cit> , in which most of the vegetative portion of the parasite lives inside of its host with emergence occurring during sexual reproduction, has evolved independently in at least  <dig> lineages, mitrastemonaceae, cytinaceae, rafflesiaceae, and apodanthaceae. furthermore, although not studied here, arceuthobium  is endoparasitic  <cit> . evolutionary convergence of the endoparasitic lifestyle in one-third of the parasitic angiosperm lineages and only in the most derived species of santalales suggests this may be a common adaptive peak of parasite-host relationships. as in animals, a selective advantage of the endoparasitic mode for plants may be to avoid predators  and live in a homeostatic environment  <cit> . third, this ordinal level-placement of all parasitic angiosperms , corroborates other recent studies and together resolve many long-standing taxonomic questions. thus, revisions of existing classifications are needed to include many of these parasites in orders they have not been placed in previously. this is particularly true of rafflesiaceae, mitrastemonaceae, cytinaceae, and apodanthaceae. further work is required to refine the positions of most parasitic plants within their orders. however, use of mtdna will require cognizance of the possibilities of hgt from host-to-parasite  <cit>  and also from parasite-to-host  <cit> . surprisingly, in spite of the conflicting nature of atp <dig> relative to coxi and matr in the endoparasites rafflesiaceae and mitrastemonaceae, confident placements were obtained in the combined analyses. in contrast, the position of cynomorium is obscured by the conflicting phylogenetic positions implied by matr  and coxi + atp <dig> . this conflict could suggest possible horizontal transfer  of matr or both coxi and atp <dig> in cynomorium; however, neither sapindalean nor saxifragalean hosts have been described in the literature to our knowledge. a placement of cynomorium with saxifragales has been suggested by 18s as well as matr  <cit> .

multiple horizontal gene transfers of atp1
one of the major predicted consequences of long-term parasitic interactions is that genetic transfer will occur between host and parasite  <cit> . although evidence to support this hypothesis has been scarce in eukaryotes, the phylogenetic evidence we present from atp <dig> of endoparasitic plants is consistent with this prediction. while hgt is plausible from host-to-parasite, it is not clear that such transfers should be advantageous to recipients. one possibility in parasites is that if their native mt loci were degenerate but could have been replaced by a highly conserved copy, then transfer should be strongly selected for because it would help ensure efficient metabolism in these extreme holoparasites. yet, there is no statistical evidence for this hypothesis in the chimeric atp <dig> sequences of pilostyles because the retained portions of the presumably older caesalpiniod xenolog  are not divergent at nonsynonymous sites relative to photosynthetic plants. regardless of any potential selective advantage of hgt, it appears that atp <dig> is mobile because of the multiple transfers that we and others have reported  <cit> . because atp <dig> appears to be located near sites of recombination in some plants  <cit> , its mobility may be facilitated. further support for hgt in parasitic plants may come from surveys of other genes, particularly from the nuclear genome of these parasites.

the close phylogenetic relationships of atp <dig> between endoparasites and their hosts, the statistically significant phylogenetic conflict of atp <dig> relative to matr + coxi, and the differential evolutionary dynamics of atp <dig> relative to coxi and matr, suggest that atp <dig> has been acquired horizontally in rafflesia + rhizanthes, pilostyles, and mitrastema from their respective host lineages. the possibility of hgt of plant mtdna, including atp <dig>  has been raised in other angiosperms  <cit>  and seems a likely explanation for our results for several reasons. first, the horizontal transfer of macromolecules, including rna, from host plant to parasitic plant has been shown to occur experimentally  <cit> . second, these parasites  are wholly endoparasitic angiosperms; they vegetatively grow completely embedded within their hosts to enhance the acquisition of water, nutrients, and complex macromolecules. third, because reproductive tissues arise from the endophytic vegetative tissue in these species, cells that carry horizontally acquired host dna are likely to give rise to reproductive meristems and transmit the new dna to future generations of the parasitic plant. future studies should aim to determine if a native copy of atp <dig> still exists in these parasites and characterize the genomic location and flanking sequence of putatively transferred sequences.

coxi intron invasion and genomic chimerism
although there have been multiple horizontal acquisitions of the homing coxi intron throughout angiosperm history  <cit> , it is clear that this invasive sequence is more prone to invade some angiosperm lineages than others . while the source of the intron is unclear in the parasites , the acquisition of foreign dna has been predicted to be a key event in the evolution of parasitic angiosperms  <cit> , and this intron could represent a marker of a genomically more widespread historical transformation. this is a particularly interesting possibility because the coxi intron in angiosperms is most closely related to those known from fungi and the evolution of haustorial parasitism has been hypothesized to have occurred via a mycoheterotrophic antecedent relationship  <cit> . recently, genomic comparisons have revealed that the shift to parasitism in nematodes may have been facilitated by the recent acquisition of foreign dna from bacteria  <cit> . whether the acquisition of foreign dna was a key step in the evolution of parasitism in plants awaits genomic studies of these parasites.

CONCLUSIONS
genomic chimerism among angiosperms is probable given that there have been multiple origins of parasitism throughout flowering plant history and that hgt is possible from host to parasite  <cit>  and vice versa  <cit> . although some parasitic lineages are highly host specific, many others have a broad range of potential host species , and host shifting is to be expected through the history of individual parasite lineages  <cit> . therefore, even if hgt between plant parasites and their hosts is very rare, through time this could result in plant genomes that are complex chimeras of horizontally as well as vertically acquired sequences.
