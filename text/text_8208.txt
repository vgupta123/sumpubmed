BACKGROUND
epitope tagging has been widely used for the analysis of protein localization, interaction, and function . it is extremely useful in studying the proteins of the ciliated protozoan tetrahymena thermophila because epitope tags can be introduced efficiently into endogenous chromosomal loci by homologous recombination in this organism  <cit> .

in many cases, a protein of interest is tagged by introducing a tag at its c-terminus  <cit>  because a drug-resistance marker, which must be introduced in proximity to the tag for the establishment of transgenic strains, rarely disturbs the gene promoter if it is inserted downstream of a target gene; thus, the tagged protein can be expressed at its endogenous levels. we previously established a set of convenient modules designed for pcr- and plasmid-based c-terminal tagging . however, sometimes a c-terminal tag renders the protein dysfunctional, disturbs the localization of the protein, or interferes with the protein's interaction with other molecules. in these cases, tagging the protein at its n-terminus might be advised.

there is a drawback to the n-terminal epitope tagging strategy in general: an insertion of a drug-resistance marker into the upstream region of a gene could disturb its promoter activity. this possibility is especially an issue in the tetrahymena system because intergenic sequences are relatively short in this organism  <cit> . to avoid this problem, in previous experiments, n-terminally tagged proteins were expressed from ectopic genome locations, such as rdna or β-tubulin  <dig>  loci, and/or by ectopic promoters at their endogenous loci  <cit> . however, expression levels and patterns of these ectopically expressed n-terminally tagged proteins could differ from those of their endogenous counterparts and thus might cause mislocalization of proteins or artificial interaction with other molecules. alternatively, a drug-resistance marker can be inserted into the downstream region of a gene for n-terminal tagging. however, in this case, the entire coding sequence and both the upstream and the downstream flanking sequences of the gene have to be cloned as a single construct, which is sometimes not easy for large genes. in addition, if homologous recombination occurs within the coding sequence, an epitope tag at the n-terminus in the construct would be lost. moreover, the inserted selectable marker could disturb the expression of the downstream gene.

we intended to use the cre/loxp recombination system to solve these problems. cre is a recombinase from the bacteriophage p <dig> that mediates intramolecular and intermolecular site-specific recombination between two loxp sites  <cit> . a loxp site consists of two  <dig> bp inverted repeats separated by an  <dig> bp asymmetric spacer region. two loxp sites in direct orientation dictate excision of the intervening dna between the sites leaving one loxp site behind. this precise excision of dna can remove a loxp-flanked drug-resistance marker from the n-terminal tagging construct after it is integrated into the macronucleus, and thus allows us to introduce epitope tags to the n-terminus of a gene of interest without disturbing its promoter. here, we describe the establishment of a cre/loxp recombination system in tetrahymena and demonstrate its usefulness for the n-terminal tagging of tetrahymena genes.

RESULTS
cre-recombinase localizes to the macronucleus in tetrahymena
to test if cre-recombinase can be expressed in tetrahymena, we designed an inducible expression system for cre. first, we constructed an expression cassette  by which we can replace the endogenous mtt <dig> coding sequence with any gene of interest. in this cassette, genes can be expressed under the control of the mtt <dig> promoter, which is induced by the presence of heavy metals such as cadmium  <cit> . we synthesized a cre-encoding gene, cre <dig>  in which the codon-usage was optimized for tetrahymena. an ha-tag was added to the n-terminus of cre <dig> and the construct was inserted into pmnmm <dig> to produce pmnmm3-ha-cre <dig> . finally, the expression construct was excised from the vector backbone of pmnmm3-ha-cre <dig> and introduced into the macronucleus of the tetrahymena b <dig> strain by homologous recombination . cells possessing the cre-expression construct were selected by their resistance against paromomycin because the construct contains a neo <dig> cassette, which confers resistance to this drug in tetrahymena cells. the neo <dig> cassette has a similar structure as neo <dig>  but has a codon-optimized neomycin-resistance gene  instead of the bacteriophage-derived neo gene.

the macronucleus is polyploid and its chromosomes randomly segregate to the daughter nuclei. by stepwise selection with increasing amounts of paromomycin, we intended to obtain strains in which the majority of the endogenous mtt <dig> loci were replaced by the cre-expression construct. we realized that some strains became resistant to a much higher concentration of paromomycin  than other strains . pcr analysis revealed that the former strains did not receive the cre gene, probably because homologous recombination had occurred at "mtt1-5'-1" and "mtt1-5'-2" . in contrast, the latter strains contained both neo <dig> and the ha-cre <dig> gene, indicating that homologous recombination had occurred at "mtt1-5'-1" and "mtt1-3'". the reason for the limited growth of ha-cre1p-expressing cells is probably due to weak mtt <dig> promoter activity caused by a paromomycin-induced stress. ha-cre1p expression suppresses cell growth , which might be the reason for the limited resistance of the ha-cre1p-expressing strain to higher concentrations of paromomycin. we used one of the latter ha-cre <dig> possessing strains, cre <dig>  for further study. in this strain, most of the endogenous mtt <dig> loci were replaced with the ha-cre <dig> expression construct .

to ask if ha-cre1p can be expressed in tetrahymena cells, the cre <dig> strain was cultured either in a nutrient-rich ) medium with or without  <dig> μg/ml cdcl <dig> or in  <dig> mm tris  with or without  <dig> ng/ml cdcl <dig> and ha-cre1p expression was detected by western blotting using an anti-ha antibody. as shown in fig. 2a, a ~ <dig> kda band, which corresponds to the predicted molecular weight of ha-cre1p , was detected only when the cre <dig> strain was treated with cdcl <dig>  therefore, the cre <dig> strain can express ha-cre1p in a cdcl2-dependent manner.  <dig> μg/ml cdcl <dig> in spp medium and  <dig> ng/ml cdcl <dig> in  <dig> mm tris induced a similar expression level of ha-cre1p. this is consistent with the fact that the mtt <dig> promoter is activated at lower concentration in cells starved in  <dig> mm tris than in those growing in spp medium  <cit> .

immunofluorescence staining using an anti-ha antibody indicated that ha-cre1p localized to the macronucleus both in the vegetative cells and conjugating cells  after its induction by cdcl <dig>  importantly, when the cre <dig> strain was crossed with a wild-type strain, ha-cre1p protein was detected in both cells of a pair . this result indicates that either ha-cre1p protein or ha-cre1p mrna can be transferred from the cre <dig> strain to the partner cell during conjugation. this is not surprising because it is known that rna and protein is exchanged between mating pairs  <cit> . therefore, the cre <dig> strain could be used to induce homologous recombination at loxp sites introduced into the macronucleus of any cell that can mate with this strain.

expression of cre-recombinase suppresses the growth of tetrahymena
because cre is a nuclease, its expression might be genotoxic to tetrahymena cells. we tested this possibility by analyzing the growth of the cre <dig> strain with and without induction of ha-cre1p expression. indeed, growth of the cre <dig> strain was significantly suppressed when the cells were cultured in the presence of  <dig> μg/ml cdcl <dig>  whereas the same amount of cdcl <dig> had little effect on the growth of the wild-type strain . the growth defect in the cre <dig> strain is not due to a reduced copy number of the mtt <dig> gene as expression of ha-cre <dig> from the btu <dig> locus  caused similar growth suppression in the presence of cdcl <dig> . these results indicate that the expression of ha-cre1p has a negative, possibly genotoxic effect on the growth of tetrahymena cells. therefore, it is necessary to minimize the exposure of cells to cre1p when it is used for tetrahymena transgenesis. the inducible cre expression system aids in minimizing this toxic effect.

cre-recombinase can induce precise recombination at loxp sites
to test if expression of the cre-recombinase can induce homologous recombination at two loxp sites, we constructed a strain, loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig>  in which the neo <dig> cassette was flanked by two loxp sequences in the twi <dig> locus . cre <dig> cells starved in  <dig> mm tris  were pre-treated with  <dig> ng/ml cdcl <dig> for  <dig>  hr to induce the expression of ha-cre1p and mated with a loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> strain in  <dig> mm tris . then, excision of the neo <dig> cassette was observed by pcr using the primers indicated in fig. 3a. as shown in fig. 3b, in addition to a ~ <dig> kb product that corresponds to the intact loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus, a ~ <dig> kb pcr product that corresponds to the locus lacking neo <dig> was detected from  <dig> hr post-mixing  onwards. this neo4-excised locus will be referred to as loxp-egfp-twi <dig>  dna sequencing of the shorter pcr product confirmed that this product resulted from the precise excision of neo <dig> by homologous recombination of two loxp sites .

the cre/loxp system can be used for n-terminal epitope tagging
in the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus, the loxp-neo4-loxp sequence is inserted directly before the first methionine-coding codon of the egfp-twi <dig> fusion gene. therefore, egfp-twi <dig> can be expressed only after the excision of the neo <dig> cassette by ha-cre1p. this system allows us to express n-terminal egfp-tagged twi1p from the endogenous twi <dig> promoter. because the parental macronucleus is eventually destroyed at the end of conjugation, the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus or the neo4-excised loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus is lost in the sexual progeny. therefore, to use the loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus for analyses of egfp-twi1p, parental cells must be recovered after the induction of conjugation between the cre <dig> and the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> strains. around a quarter of mating wild-type tetrahymena cells aborts conjugation before producing zygotic nuclei and haploid meiotic micronuclear products are endoreplicated to regenerate a diploid micronucleus. parental macronuclei are preserved in this process  <cit> .

we established a method to efficiently recover cells after aborting conjugation and to distinguish the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig>  strain from cre <dig>  the method is schematically shown in fig. 4a. first, individual mating pairs were isolated into drops of 1× spp at  <dig> hpm and cells aborting conjugation in these drops by  <dig> hpm were isolated into drops of fresh 1× spp. because mating continues until ~ <dig> hpm if the zygotic nuclei are successfully produced, cells separated by  <dig> hpm most probably maintain the parental macronuclei. out of  <dig> pairs isolated we retrieved  <dig> sets of clones in which both sides of the separated cells continued to grow. they were then cultured in 1× spp containing  <dig> μg/ml cdcl <dig>  because the expression of ha-cre1p severely inhibits the growth of tetrahymena, one side of the clones in each set was expected to grow slowly in the presence of cdcl <dig>  indeed, in  <dig> out of the  <dig> sets of the clones studied, severe growth suppression was detected in one side of the clones. in the other  <dig> sets, both sides of cells grew at equal speed. these are likely to represent progeny cells and were not analyzed further.

we expected that the clones growing poorly in the presence of cdcl <dig> were derived from the cre <dig> strain, while the normally growing clones originated from the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> strain. genomic dna was extracted from the latter clones and excision of the neo <dig> cassette was observed by pcr. as shown in fig. 4b, the pcr product corresponding to the neo4-excised loxp-egfp-twi <dig> locus was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> clones studied. this result indicated that they indeed were derived from the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> strain and cre-recombinase expressed in the cre <dig> side of the pair was transported to the loxp-neo4-loxp-egfp-twi <dig> side and efficiently induced neo <dig> excision. only one clone failed to produce any pcr products. this clone could be either derived from the cre <dig> strain or from progeny cells that we could not correctly identify by the growth assay in the presence of cdcl <dig>  therefore, the method we established here can efficiently identify parental cells derived from a loxp-possessing strain.

to assess the correct excision of the neo <dig> cassette in these clones, they were crossed with the wild-type strain cu <dig> and egfp-twi1p expression was observed. in all  <dig> clones  analyzed, egfp-twi1p was exclusively expressed during conjugation and was localized to the macronucleus. egfp-twi1p localization of clone # <dig> is shown in fig.  <dig>  the expression of egfp indicated that neo <dig> was most likely excised precisely at the two loxp sites because imprecise excision might cause a frame-shift that abolishes egfp-twi1p expression. the conjugation-specific expression and the macronuclear localization of egfp-twi1p mirror the properties of twi1p in wild-type cells  <cit> , strongly suggesting that the endogenous twi <dig> promoter correctly drives the downstream egfp-twi <dig> expression.

discussion
in this study, we have established a cre/loxp recombination system in tetrahymena and have demonstrated that this system is useful for n-terminal egfp tagging of the twi <dig> gene. although we have tested only n-terminal egfp tagging here, we expect that this system can be applied to any type of epitope tag. however, because one loxp sequence remains after the cre-mediated recombination event in this system, functionalities  of each epitope tag could be disturbed by the presence of the short peptides  encoded by the loxp sequence. therefore, validity of this system must be carefully examined for each epitope tag.

we also believe that the system established in this study can be used for internal epitope tagging. in addition, it may be safer to use this system for c-terminal epitope tagging because intergenic sequences are relatively short in tetrahymena  and the presence of a drug-resistance marker at the 3'-flanking region of some genes could disturb the promoter function of a neighboring gene. moreover, similar to the "brainbow" mouse  <cit> , combinatory use of multiple loxp mutant sequences may allow us to produce tetrahymena cells expressing a protein tagged with several different epitope tags by a single transformation experiment followed by cre-mediated recombination.

cre/loxp recombination systems have also been used for conditional gene knockouts  <cit>  and recycling drug-resistance markers for multiple transformations  <cit>  in other model organisms. we expect that the system described here can be used for these applications in tetrahymena as well. however, because tetrahymena has a polyploid  macronucleus and because the loxp excision did not occur in all of the macronuclear copies in the condition we tested , it will be necessary to improve the recombination efficiency to use the cre/loxp system for these applications in tetrahymena. nonetheless, the existing technique is already applicable to recycle a drug-resistance marker. the macronuclear chromosomes segregate randomly to daughter nuclei, and thus we can obtain cells in which all copies of a locus have a loxp-excised form by phenotypic assortment  <cit> .

we chose a relatively complex procedure to introduce cre1p into cells: ha-cre <dig> expressing cells were mated with cells possessing the loxp target locus. because of the following two reasons, we believe this strategy has great advantage over other possible methods such as introducing the ha-cre <dig> gene and a loxp target locus into the same cell. first, as shown in fig. 2c, expression of ha-cre1p suppresses cell growth, suggesting that ha-cre1p is probably toxic to tetrahymena. therefore, it is necessary to minimize the exposure of cells to ha-cre1p. although the mtt <dig> promoter, which is driving the ha-cre1p expression, is inducible by the presence of cadmium, it is known that in the absence of cadmium leaky expression occurs  <cit> . in our strategy the exposure of cells to ha-cre1p can be tightly controlled and thus potential cell damages are avoided. second, if we introduce ha-cre <dig> and a loxp-flanked marker locus into the same cell, leaky expression of ha-cre1p from the mtt <dig> promoter may eliminate the marker. this possibly makes phenotypic assortment difficult. our strategy is free from this problem because strains containing ha-cre <dig> and the loxp-flanked marker are prepared separately.

CONCLUSIONS
cre-recombinase can be expressed in tetrahymena and localizes to the macronucleus. it can induce precise recombination at two loxp sequences in direct orientation in the macronuclear chromosome. the successful construction of a strain expressing n-terminal egfp-tagged twi <dig> from the endogenous twi <dig> locus let us conclude that the cre/loxp recombination system established in this study is a useful tool for n-terminal epitope tagging of tetrahymena genes.
