BACKGROUND
spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  is an autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual problems due to a progressive loss of neurons within the cerebellum, retina and brainstem  <cit> . expansion of an unstable cag repeat in the first coding exon of the sca <dig> gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine domain in the n-terminal of the ataxin- <dig>  protein causes the disease  <cit> . the atxn <dig> protein is widely expressed in the nervous system  <cit>  and is a subunit of the staga 31-gcn5l acetylase) complex  <cit> .

to date, nine disorders including huntington’s disease , dentatorubral and pallidoluysian atrophy , spinobulbar muscular atrophy  and six forms of spinocerebellar ataxias  caused by expanded polyglutamine domains have been identified, for review see  <cit> . these disorders are commonly known as polyglutamine  diseases and are characterized by the aggregation of the expanded polyq protein. mutant atxn <dig> has been shown to aggregate and form inclusions in both patients and cell models  <cit> . a correlation between the ability of polyglutamine proteins to aggregate and toxicity has been shown, however, whether misfolded monomers, oligomers or large inclusions formed during the aggregation process are the major toxic species is still unclear  <cit> .

oxidative stress arise when the levels of free radicals exceed the capacity of the cell’s endogenous anti-oxidant systems and result in damage to cellular components like dna, lipids and proteins  <cit> . prolonged oxidative stress can lead to cell death and this pathway has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases including alzheimer’s disease , parkinson’s disease  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , for review see  <cit> . oxidative stress has also been implicated in polyglutamine diseases, for instance huntington’s disease, drpla and sca <dig>  <cit> . ros  is a major type of free radicals in cells and is normally produced during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria  <cit> . up to 2% of the electrons passing the electron transport chain escape and reacts with molecular oxygen to yield ros. due to their high metabolic rate neurons are exposed to high levels of ros  <cit> . other sources of ros is nadph oxidase  complexes and enzymes like xanthine oxidase, lipooxygenase and cyclooxygenase  <cit> . nox complexes produce superoxide anions and are present in neurons as well as astrocytes and microglia  <cit> . to prevent damage from excess ros, neurons and other cells have an extensive anti-oxidant defense system made up of several enzymes and small molecules  <cit> . enzymes with anti-oxidant function include glutathione transferases , super oxide dismutases , superoxide reductase, catalase , peroxiredoxins  and glutathione peroxidases . glutathione  an important small anti-oxidant molecule protects cells against oxidative stress by conjugating with ros in a reaction catalyzed by gst  <cit> . during the conjugation reaction gsh become oxidized into glutathione disulfide  and is thus depleted. gsh depletion have been shown to occur in neurodegenerative disorders like parkinson’s disease  <cit> . in mammals, there are at least three forms of sod: a cytosolic , a mitochondrial  and an extracellular  form. sod enzymes catalyze the dismutation of superoxide, a primary ros, into hydrogen peroxide  <cit> . the hydrogen peroxide is then further converted to water and oxygen by cat, prxs or gpxs  <cit> .

in this study, we show that oxidative stress plays a major role in atxn7-induced toxicity using a new stable inducible pc <dig> cell model. we found that induction of mutant atxn7q65-gfp expression led to a concomitant increase in ros levels and aggregation of the disease protein followed by decreased cell viability a few days later. analysis of some key anti-oxidant defense enzymes revealed decreased levels of catalase, which could contribute to decreased clearance of ros. furthermore, inhibition of nox complexes prevented the increase in ros and ameliorated aggregation suggesting that mutant atxn <dig> increase the ros levels by activating this complex. moreover, supporting the cells through application of exogenous anti-oxidants or inhibition of nox complexes ameliorated axtn7q <dig> induced toxicity.

RESULTS
expression of mutant atxn <dig> leads to oxidative stress followed by toxicity in an inducible sca <dig> pc <dig> cell model
to study the impact of mutant atxn <dig> on cellular functions we used two recently generated stable inducible pc <dig> cell lines expressing n-terminal flag- and c-terminal gfp-tagged atxn <dig> with  <dig>  or  <dig>  glutamines  <cit> . in these cell lines the expression of the corresponding transgenic proteins named atxn7q10-gfp and atxn7q65-gfp is controlled by the tet-off expression system and induced by removal of doxycycline from the cell culture media. the induction timing, expression levels and sub-cellular localization of the transgenic atxn7-gfp proteins have previously been extensively characterized and showed not to differ in these two cell lines  <cit> . immunoblotting with an atxn <dig> antibody revealed weak expression after three days of induction, but clear expression of both constructs from day  <dig> onwards .

analysis of cell viability/toxicity revealed a progressive decrease in viability and increased toxicity as expression of atxn7q65-gfp was induced, see figure 1c-d. a significant decrease in viability was observed from day  <dig> after induction using the wst- <dig> viability assay . in accordance with this a statistical increase in toxicity, measured as membrane leakage, could also be observed on day  <dig> after induction . in contrast, expression of the atxnq10-gfp protein did not result in any significant change in cell viability or toxicity on any day . to establish whether induction of oxidative stress by atxn7q65-gfp could play a role in the decreased cell viability, we measured total cellular ros levels at various time points after induction of atxn7q65-gfp expression. we found that the ros levels increased in a time dependent manner after induction of atxn7q65-gfp expression . a significant increase in ros was first observed at day  <dig>  prior to the decrease in viability of the atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells. in contrast, expression of atxnq10-gfp protein did not result in any significant change in total cellular ros levels . as a positive control increased levels of ros could be observed in both flq <dig> and flq <dig> cells after treatment with hydrogen peroxide .

to further confirm that expression of atxn7q65-gfp resulted in an oxidative environment, we measured the gsh level in flq <dig> cells induced to express atxn7q65-gfp for nine days. a significant reduction in the gsh level was observed . taken together, these observations suggest that expression of atxn7q65-gfp results in increased ros levels and oxidative stress prior to any observable toxicity.

anti-oxidant treatment rescues atxn7q65-gfp toxicity
to confirm that the oxidative stress conditions induced by atxn7q65-gfp played a role in the decreased cell viability, flq <dig> cells induced to express atxn7q65-gfp for nine days while growing in media supplemented or not supplemented with the anti-oxidants α-tocopherol  or nac were analyzed. treatment with either anti-oxidant rescued the viability of atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells and there was no longer any difference in viability between non-induced and induced flq <dig> cells expressing atxn7q65-gfp . the positive effects of the anti-oxidant treatments were not due to changes in atxn <dig> expression, as neither treatment did alter the expression level of soluble atxn7q65-gfp . this result suggests that oxidative stress is contributing to the toxicity in sca <dig> and this effect can be counteracted by application of an anti-oxidant.

oxidative stress affects aggregation of mutant atxn7
to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and atxn <dig> aggregation, we analyzed whether anti-oxidant treatment of our stable flq <dig> cells induced to express atxn7q65-gfp also had an effect on the level of atxn <dig> aggregation. results showed that both α-tocopherol and nac treatment during the induction of atxn7q65-gfp expression in the stable pc <dig> cell model lowered the level of aggregated atxn <dig> material with circa 40–80% . to further confirm the connection between oxidative stress and atxn <dig> aggregation and make sure that the effect seen in figure  <dig> was not influenced by the gfp-tag on atxn <dig> or specific to pc <dig> cells, we did further experiments in hek 293 t cells transfected to express myc-tagged atxn <dig> with  <dig>  or  <dig>  glutamines. we first investigated whether support of the anti-oxidant system could also ameliorate the aggregation of atxn7q65-myc, by co-transfecting the hek 293 t cells with atxn7q65-myc and rorα or sod <dig>  over-expression of rorα, a transcription factor known to activate anti-oxidant genes  <cit> , ameliorated the aggregation of atxn7q65-myc . so did over-expression of wild-type sod <dig> with full dismutase activity, whereas co-expression of mutant forms of sod <dig> with reduced   <cit>  or no enzymatic activity   <cit>  showed reduced or no ability, respectively, to reduce atxn7q65-myc aggregation . neither rorα nor sod <dig> co-expression affected the expression of soluble atxn7q65-myc . we next investigated whether promotion of an oxidative environment could aggravate the aggregation of atxn7q65-myc by treating transfected hek 293 t cells with increasing concentrations of h2o <dig>  or bso  an inhibitor of gsh biosynthesis  <cit> . no trace of aggregated material could be detected in atxn7q10-myc expressing cells under control or treated conditions . however, aggregated atxn <dig> material was detected in atxn7q65-myc cells and both h2o <dig> and bso treatment led to an increase in aggregated material without affecting the expression of soluble atxn7q65-myc . taken together, these data suggest that there is a clear connection between oxidative stress and aggregation of mutant atxn <dig> 

expression of atxn7q65-gfp results in changed expression levels of some key anti-oxidant enzymes
mutant atxn <dig> could induce oxidative stress by interfering with the anti-oxidant defense system or by causing an increase in free radical production. to investigate the status of the anti-oxidant defense system, we analyzed the expression levels of some key anti-oxidant enzymes; glutathione transferase a <dig> , sod <dig> and cat in our stable pc <dig> model. after induction of atxn7q65-gfp, the expression levels of gsta <dig> and sod <dig> showed a progressively increasing trend with statistical differences in expression at day  <dig> and/or  <dig> after induction . in contrast, the expression level of cat showed a decreasing trend after induction of atxn7q65-gfp . we also investigated whether anti-oxidant treatment could prevent the change in expression of these enzymes. indeed, in induced flq <dig> cells grown in nac supplemented media for 9 days, the increase in gsta <dig> and sod <dig> expression was reduced or completely gone . however, the decreased expression of cat was not restored . our results suggest that the cell is trying to cope with the oxidative environment by up-regulating at least some key anti-oxidant enzymes.

increased ros production from nox complexes in atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells
mitochondria are a major source of ros and damage to mitochondria resulting in increased mitochondrial superoxide anion production has been implicated in neurodegeneration. to investigate whether this mechanism plays a role in the elevation of the ros levels in our atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells, we measure the level of mitochondrial superoxide anions at various time points after induction of atxn7q65-gfp expression. no increase in mitochondrial superoxide production could be observed at any time point after atxn7q65-gfp induction . antimycin a treatment was used as a positive control and elevated the levels of mitochondrial ros as expected .

we then went on to investigate whether an increased ros production by nox complexes contributes to the oxidative stress environment induced by atxn7q65-gfp. the level of ros, gsh and atxn <dig> aggregation, as well as viability, was measured in flq <dig> cells induced to express atxn7q65-gfp for nine days while growing in media supplemented or not supplemented with a nox complex inhibitor apocynin . the apocynin treatment completely blocked the increase in ros, led to a small increase in the level of gsh, reduced atxn <dig> aggregation and ameliorated the toxicity in atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells . similarly treatment of the atxn7q65-gfp expressing cells with the cell-permeable gp91ds-tat peptide, a specific nox complex inhibitor  <cit> , also decreased ros levels and ameliorated the toxicity . in contrast, treatment with the control peptide scramble-tat had no effect on ros levels or viability . these results suggest that mutant atxn <dig> either directly or indirectly leads to activation of nox complexes resulting in increased ros production and oxidative stress in our cell model.

discussion
oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases. in this study we show that oxidative stress is a major contributor to aggregation and toxicity of the sca <dig> disease protein atxn <dig>  furthermore, our results suggest that mutant atxn <dig> could cause oxidative stress by directly or indirectly reducing the levels of the anti-oxidant enzyme cat and increasing the ros production through nox complexes. most importantly we show that anti-oxidant treatment or inhibition of ros production from nox complexes ameliorates atxn <dig> toxicity.

to study the role of oxidative stress in sca <dig>  we used a new stable inducible cell model  in which the expression of gfp-tagged atxn <dig> with an expanded glutamine domain  is controlled by the tet-off system. in this model, clear expression and aggregation of atxn7q65-gfp was detected six days after induction , ros levels was increased from day  <dig> and the cell viability decreased from day  <dig> onwards. the increase in ros levels hence preceded cell toxicity in our model and anti-oxidant treatment not only reduced ros levels but also completely rescued the viability of our cells. this suggests that mutant atxn <dig> cause toxicity by inducing oxidative stress. other polyglutamine proteins have also been shown to cause elevated ros levels and oxidative damage to dna and lipids have been reported in both hd patients and animal models, for review see  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which expanded polyglutamine proteins alter the redox-homeostasis is unclear. increased ros production either due to aggregating structures functioning as centers for oxidative reactions  <cit>  or polyglutamine proteins causing damage to the mitochondria electron transport chain  <cit>  has been suggested. in our study we saw no evidence for increased ros production from mitochondria. however, we found that inhibition of nox complexes prevented the atxn7q65-gfp induced elevation of ros and ameliorated the atxn <dig> toxicity. this is in agreement with a recent study by bertoni et al.  <cit> , suggesting that expression of an expanded polyq stretch can lead to nox activation. nox complexes have been mostly studied in immune cells where their production of large burst of superoxide participates in the killing of invading microorganisms. however, nox complexes are also present in neurons and pc <dig> cells, and have been suggested to regulate neurite outgrowth and neuronal activity  <cit> . sod <dig> is a key enzyme for clearing away superoxide anions and convert the radical into molecular oxygen and h2o <dig> <cit> . following this dismutase reaction, the h2o <dig>  which is also reactive, is cleared away by catalase or other enzymes like glutathione peroxidases  <cit> . in our study we observed an increased expression of sod <dig>  which is most likely an adaptive response to increased superoxide levels. similarly we could observe increased level of gsta <dig>  an enzymes that detoxify oxidatively damaged molecules for instance lipid peroxidation products  <cit> . however, we could also observe a decrease in the expression of catalase which could compromise the clearance of h2o <dig> and contribute to the generation of an oxidative environment. in agreement with our finding, decreased catalase activity have been reported in fibroblast cultures of hd patients  <cit>  and decreased catalase expression was also observed in a hd cell model by reijonen et al  <cit> . however, in the reijonen study they also in contradiction to our results observed a decrease in several other anti-oxidant enzymes including sod <dig> and sod <dig>  <cit> . the contradictory results between our study and reijonen et al could reflect differences between mutant huntingtin and atxn <dig> or differences in expression length and levels in our stable model and their transient transfection model. in fact, increased levels of several antioxidants including sod <dig>  peroxiredoxins and glutathione peroxidases have also been reported in hd patients by sorolla et al  <cit> . however, comparing our results with the data from the study by sorolla et al also shows differences, as sorolla et al identified increased levels of catalase in hd brain  <cit> . again the difference between the sorolla study and our data could reflect differences between huntingtin and atxn <dig>  it is possible that mutant atxn <dig> as a subunit in the co-activator complex staga might specifically effect the regulation of catalase gene expression. interestingly, we could see that the decrease in catalase levels in our mutant atxn <dig> cells could not be reversed by anti-oxidant treatment even though this prevented the increase in ros and reversed the changes in sod <dig> and gsta <dig> levels. this suggests that the mechanism by which mutant atxn <dig> effect catalase levels could be different than the mechanism altering sod <dig> and gsta <dig>  taken together, it seems clear that mutant atxn <dig> as many other polyglutamine proteins induce oxidative stress and changes in the anti-oxidant defense system. however, which components of the anti-oxidant system are altered and how these alterations contributes to reduce or worsen the oxidative stress and toxicity induced by the different polyglutamine proteins is still more unclear and requires more investigation.

providing anti-oxidant support have been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for polyglutamine disease, for review see  <cit> . consistent with this idea treatment with a general anti-oxidant or counteracting the increased ros production by inhibition of nox complexes not only ameliorated the toxicity of mutant atxn <dig>  but also reduced the level of aggregated atxn <dig> in our sca <dig> model. in contrast, treatment with oxidative stress inducers  elevated atxn <dig> aggregation. hence there is a strong correlation between oxidative stress and atxn <dig> aggregation. misfolding and aggregation of polyq-expanded protein is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of polyq-diseases  <cit> . however, whether misfolded monomers, oligomers or large inclusions formed during the aggregation process are the major toxic species is still unclear  <cit> . furthermore, proteolytic cleavage of several polyglutamine proteins generating more aggregate prone and toxic fragments has been reported  <cit> . in sca <dig>  cleavage of atxn <dig> by caspase- <dig> at amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> has been reported  <cit> . in our model we could observe n-terminal atxn <dig> fragments  <cit>  and these, as well as the full-length protein and aggregated material is present at the time when we observe increase in ros levels. furthermore, we have seen that full-length atxn <dig> is predominately localized to the nucleus, whereas these n-terminal fragments show a more cytoplasmic localization  <cit> . since nox complexes are mostly localized in cytoplasmic vesicles or in the plasma membrane  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that if atxn <dig> activates nox complexes through a direct interaction, then it is possibly the n-terminal mutant atxn <dig> fragments which do so either in a soluble or aggregated form. this would be in line with the observation by young et al. showing higher cellular toxicity by n-terminal atxn <dig> fragments  <cit> . clearly future studies are needed to determine the exact mechanism and which form of mutant atxn <dig> that induces the nox activity.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our work suggests that mutant atxn <dig> induce oxidative stress by reducing the level of the anti-oxidant enzyme cat and increasing the ros production from nox complexes. we show that there is a clear correlation between ros levels, mutant atxn <dig> aggregation and decreased viability. moreover, inhibition of nox complexes or treatment with an anti-oxidant can ameliorate the mutant atxn <dig> toxicity.
