BACKGROUND
circadian clocks allow most eukaryotes and some prokaryotes to anticipate the environmental day/night cycle, through rhythmic modulation of multiple physiological processes  <cit> . circadian clocks are characterised by free running rhythms with a period of ~24 h even in the absence of any environmental cues, such as in constant light conditions. their timing is synchronised with the environmental day-night cycle principally by responses to light and temperature, but clock circuits also respond to many additional stimuli. the signalling pathways from such stimuli are often found to be rhythmically controlled by the clock, forming nested feedback loops that modify the circadian oscillator. the gene circuit of the higher plant clock consists of interlocked morning and evening loops operating through negative feedback mechanisms  <cit> . toc <dig> is an important component of the plant clock since its mutation or overexpression dramatically change the properties of the central oscillator  <cit> .

although the importance of toc <dig> in the plant circadian clock has long being recognized, the precise role of toc <dig> in the clock has been a matter of debate  <cit> . based on indirect genetic evidence it was first proposed that toc <dig> activated the expression of the key transcription factors lhy and cca <dig> <cit> , although several observations on clock mutants remained paradoxical. recent experimental and computational data  <cit>  have demonstrated that toc <dig> functions as a repressor rather than an activator. the studies also show that toc <dig> repression is not limited to cca <dig> and lhy but to nearly all of the genes at the core of the oscillator  <cit> . the observed reduction in the expression of multiple clock genes by up-regulation of toc <dig> could not be described by our previous model, where only lhy and cca <dig> were affected by toc <dig>  <cit> . here, we extend our previous model by including the repression of multiple clock genes by toc <dig> and explore toc <dig> effect on the clock. in particular, we analysed clock dynamics in various toc1-misexpressed lines and addressed the long-standing paradox of simultaneous reduction of lhy and cca <dig> amplitudes in both toc <dig> mutant and toc1-overexpressed  plants  <cit> .

the recently discovered pervasive negative effect of toc <dig> on gene expression  <cit> , the overlap between microarrays of the toc1- and aba-regulated genes and the gated induction of toc <dig> by the stress hormone abscisic acid aba  <cit>  suggests that toc <dig> might integrate environmental and circadian information to regulate downstream physiology at specific time of the day  <cit> . here we combined the clock model with key processes regulated by aba and explored mutual interactions between clock and aba pathways. the model describes the regulation of stomatal aperture, one of the most important outputs of aba signalling, which is gated by the clock  <cit> . being a sensor of water availability in plants, aba level increases under dry conditions, which accelerates closing of stomata in the afternoon  <cit> . in agreement with the microarray studies, toc <dig> mis-expressing plants were shown to have altered aba-dependent stomata closure and affected responses to drought conditions  <cit> . to model the observed gating of stomatal opening by the clock, we included the interaction of aba with the abar protein  – a key component of the aba signalling pathway, arguably postulated as aba receptor  <cit> . besides being one of the downstream targets of toc <dig>  abar was shown to be a key component in the gating of aba signalling by the clock  <cit> . we used the model to explore the dynamics of the opening of stomatal pore under various genetic and environmental perturbations, such as mutations of clock genes and by changing the light and water conditions, and showed that the model provides good match to existing experimental data. our results show how the dual roles of toc <dig> are integrated, combining timing and environmental information to modulate downstream physiology.

RESULTS
model description
the latest plant clock model  <cit> , herein called p <dig>  was revised by adding the recently discovered negative regulation of the oscillator genes by toc <dig>  as described in the section  <dig> below. additionally, we have included a simplified version of the main steps leading to the induction of toc <dig> by aba and the regulation of stomata aperture , described in the section  <dig> below.

 <dig>  extending the clock model by inhibition of gene expression by toc1

the latest model of the arabidopsis oscillator  <cit>  was extended based on our recent data on the inhibition of expression of multiple clock genes by toc <dig> and induction of toc <dig> through aba signalling. the model is described by a system of  <dig> odes. the basic structure of the plant clock was kept from our previous p <dig> model  <cit> . briefly, the key components of the clock are the lhy and cca <dig> morning genes and the evening complex  genes. lhy and cca <dig> are similarly expressed around dawn and act together to regulate multiple targets. they are described by single variable lhy/cca <dig> as before. ec  genes lux, elf <dig>  and elf <dig> are expressed around dusk and form the ec protein complex, which suppresses expression of multiple genes at night . lhy/cca <dig> expression is suppressed by the prr proteins in a morning loop, while the ec is negatively regulated by the ubiquitin e <dig> ligase cop <dig> , which targets elf <dig> protein to degradation by proteasome and by gi protein, in the evening loop. the morning and evening loops are further interlocked through the suppression of evening gene expression by lhy/cca <dig> and suppression of prr <dig> and toc <dig>  expression by the ec. the model also includes the f box protein ztl , which negatively regulates the level of toc <dig> protein. light entrains the clock similarly to the p <dig> model through several mechanisms, which are supported by experimental data  <cit> . the main mechanisms include acute activation of lhy/cca <dig>  prr <dig> and gi transcription  immediately after dawn; stabilization of prr proteins in presence of light  and light-dependent regulation of the ec by cop <dig> and gi proteins .

the toc1-related reactions were substantially extended. firstly, we added multiple reactions of inhibition of clock gene expression by toc <dig>  this includes direct inhibition of expression of lhy/cca <dig> as in the p <dig> model , and also prr <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig>  lux, elf <dig> and gi , which is based on our data  <cit>  . the details of toc <dig> interactions with other regulators  to modulate gene expression are largely unknown, so we assumed that toc <dig> acts as a non-competitive inhibitor of gene expression secondly, we added physiologically relevant activation of toc <dig> expression by the aba signalling pathway , described in section  <dig> below. this provided an additional level of input to the clock through aba, which is induced by stress. thirdly, we added regulation of stomata aperture as a clock output, which is directly related to both aba and toc <dig> signalling , as presented in section  <dig> below.

symbol “s” corresponds to stomata aperture in relative units . a <dig> is the total aba level in relative units. aba level for most of calculations was set to  <dig>  unless it is stated otherwise .

the quasi-steady state approximation for the nuclear complexes elf3-gi, elf3-elf <dig> and nuclear gi protein, which reduces the number of equations, was taken from the p <dig> model. cop <dig> nuclear activity was described by two forms of cop <dig> . the parameters nj represent the rate constants of transcription and stomata opening, mj are the rate constants of degradation; pj are constants of translation, protein modification and protein complex formation; gj are michaelis-menten constants and a, b, c, d, e,f, g, h, i, j are hill coefficients; qj are the rate constants of acute  light activation of transcription. the acute light response in activation of prr <dig>  lhy/cca <dig>  gi, transcription  was modelled using a light-sensitive activator – protein p , which is accumulated in darkness and was degraded in light similarly to the p <dig> model . l =  <dig> when light is present,  <dig> otherwise; d = 1-l. thel function was used to simulate smooth transitions between l and d analogous to the p <dig> model:

 lt= <dig> ·−dawn)/t))−/t))+−24)/t))) 

where dawn and dusk are the phases of dawn and dusk ; t is the duration of twilight ; tanh and floor – standard functions of hyperbolic tangent and rounding operation. this representation of periodic input corresponds to the input signal step function, which now has convenient software support in sbml  <cit> . mutations of the clock genes were simulated by decreasing the rate of transcription of the corresponding gene to zero. toc1-ox plants were modelled by adding the background activation of toc <dig> translation .

the equations for cop <dig> e <dig> ligase activities , which were developed in p <dig>  are independent of the clock and their parameters were constrained from the data on the kinetics of cop <dig> substrates hfr <dig> and hy <dig> proteins upon dark/light transitions similarly to p <dig>  <cit> . the equations for hy <dig> and hfr <dig> proteins, which were used only for the optimization of cop <dig> parameters, are taken from p2011:

 <dig>  modelling of aba signalling and its relation with the clock

to model the mutual connections between the clock and aba signalling, we extended the clock model by including aba-induced reactions.

the first group of reactions of aba signalling is related with the inactivation of protein phosphatase pp2c  by the aba complex . based on the data showing relatively small diurnal changes in aba concentration in plants  <cit> , we assumed that aba level is constant in our model and treated it as a parameter aba <dig>  next we included the potential aba receptor abar, which is a necessary component of the regulation of both toc <dig> expression and stomatal aperture by aba  <cit> . abar expression has a strong circadian pattern, peaking in the morning  <cit> . our analysis of the abar promoter in arabidopsis revealed  <dig> cca <dig> binding sites  aaatct  <cit> , in addition to the known toc1-binding sites  <cit> , suggesting a possible mechanism for the regulation of abar transcription by the clock. this was described in our model through activation of abar expression by lhy/cca <dig> and its inhibition by toc <dig> . to simplify the model and reduce the number of equations, we used a quasi-steady state approximation for the aba complex with abar, assuming that abar protein level follows the cognate mrna. pp2c activity was described through its inhibition by this aba complex .

the second important group of reactions of aba signalling is related with the activation of snf <dig> -related protein kinase snrk <dig> by aba  <cit> . this activation happens through double-negative interactions: the aba complex inactivates pp2c and pp2c inactivates snrk <dig>  so we included in the model an equation for snrk <dig> activity, which is inhibited by pp2c . after activation by aba, snrk <dig> mediates multiple reactions of the aba pathway, including induction of transcription of multiple target genes which possess abre elements  in their promoters  <cit> . as toc <dig> was reported to be induced by aba  <cit> , we analysed the toc <dig> promoter and identified  <dig> abre elements. this suggested that a mechanism of toc <dig> induction by aba is similar to other genes and mediated by snrk <dig> . therefore we included in the model the activation of toc <dig> expression by snrk <dig>  assuming that this activation competes with inhibition of toc <dig> by lhy/cca <dig> protein . an analogous mechanism of aba signalling through the aba/pp2c/snrk <dig> pathway is involved in the acceleration of stomatal closing by aba  <cit> , which we included into the model. the equation for stomatal aperture describes stomatal opening in a phenomenological way, which allowed us qualitatively compare the model behaviour with physiological data. additionally to the inhibition of stomatal opening by aba signalling through active snrk <dig>  we included the known activation of stomatal opening in the presence of light .

so finally the clock model was extended by including eqs. - for abar, pp2c, snrk <dig> and stomata aperture . thus we connected the clock with a simple version of aba signalling, which enabled us to simulate toc <dig> and stomatal regulation by aba. the effective parameters of the aba-related reactions were optimized together with other parameters the clock model against multiple perturbations as described below.

additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows simulated diurnal kinetics of the main components of aba signalling under the optimal parameters, which are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the peak of abar transcription soon after dawn corresponds to the publicly available microarray data , which agrees with rt-q-pcr analysis  <cit> . the accumulation of aba-abar complex in the day time leads to inactivation of pp2c and activation of snrk <dig>  with the peak of snrk <dig> activity in the afternoon . snrk <dig> then induces toc <dig> expression and stimulates the closing of stomata as described above.

 <dig>  solving the system of odes

the extension of p <dig> by adding newly discovered processes of the inhibition of the prr <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig>  lux, elf <dig> and gi clock genes by toc <dig>  resulted in the addition of  <dig> new parameters to p <dig>  our model was also extended compared to p <dig> by adding reactions describing aba-related processes , which introduced  <dig> more new parameters. finally, the model describes the dynamics of stomatal opening, which was absent from p <dig>  resulting in  <dig> more new parameters. therefore, the higher level of biological complexity of the model and its extension to hormonal signalling through aba inevitably increased the parameter space, adding  <dig> parameters compared to p <dig>  this allowed our model to describe experimental data that were not described by p <dig>  such as the inhibition of multiple clock genes by toc <dig>  stimulation of toc <dig> expression by aba signalling, changing the clock period by aba and the dynamics of stomata presented in the results below. in addition, the new structure of the clock, which now incorporates aba signalling to the clock through toc <dig>  allowed us to improve the description of the data on the clock kinetics compared to p <dig>  as shown in the results below.

parameter values were either constrained based on experimental data or fitted to multiple time-series data sets, similarly to the p <dig> model.  <dig> out of the total  <dig> parameters were constrained based on the available experimental data. most of these parameters have the same values as in p <dig> because they were constrained by the same data. other parameters were fitted to multiple datasets similarly to p <dig>  but their values may be different from p <dig> because the structures of the models are different. the optimal set of parameters is presented in additional file 2: table s <dig>  the new model, under the optimal parameter values, retains most of its properties from p <dig>  keeping the good fit to data from various conditions, such as diurnal cycles of the wild type and lhy/cca <dig>  lhy/cca1/gi and elf <dig> mutants, as well as continuous light or darkness in the wild type and multiple mutants. for example, the period values for the simulated free-running clock in wild type and mutant plants were  <dig>  h for wild type under constant light conditions,  <dig>  h for wild type under constant darkness and  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h,  <dig>  h for lhy/cca <dig>  toc <dig>  ztl, prr <dig> and gi mutants in constant light, which match the experimental observations  <cit> . additionally lhy/cca1/gi, elf <dig>  elf <dig> and lux mutants were arrhythmic in constant light, in agreement with the data  <cit> . we also tested the sensitivity of the model to the variations of the newly introduced parameters of the inhibition of target genes by toc <dig> and aba signalling. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the relative changes in the amplitude of lhy expression and the clock period in constant light conditions under 10% changes of each parameter. we observed less than 3% changes in the period and less than 12% change in the amplitude of lhy mrna under variations of these parameters, which shows that the extended model retains its robustness to parameter perturbations from p <dig> . thus, the optimal set of parameters demonstrated good correspondence to multiple datasets and provides robust behaviour in the model. however, given the significant complexity of the model, which is related to the complexity of the biological processes involved, and the number of unknown parameters, we cannot exclude the existence of other parameter sets that might equally describe the data. the detailed study of this large parameter space lies outside the scope of this paper. the model with the current parameter set matches well enough to the data to make it a useful instrument for the exploration of the possible mechanisms of the observed biological phenomenon.

aba modulates expression of the clock genes through the induction of toc <dig> expression followed by suppression of toc <dig> target genes. additional file 1: figure s <dig> shows the dependence of the peak mrna values of all clock genes on the aba levels, demonstrating that elf <dig>  lux, gi, prr <dig> and prr <dig> are the most sensitive to aba in our model.

modulation of circadian dynamics via clock gene repression by toc1
the extension of our previous p <dig> model with the parallel suppressive effects of toc <dig> on the oscillator genes  allowed us to improve the description of data from several clock mutants compared to p <dig>  without affecting the good fit of the p <dig> model to the data of other mutants. figure  <dig> shows the profiles of clock gene expression in the simulated toc1-mis-expressing plants and explains the mechanisms involved. the observed decrease in the peak level of lhy/cca <dig> expression in the toc <dig> mutant suggested that toc <dig> was an activator of lhy and cca <dig> <cit> . although toc <dig> is a repressor of lhy/cca <dig> in the model, removing toc <dig> also reduces lhy/cca <dig> expression . the simulated toc <dig> mutation increases the levels of the remaining lhy/cca <dig> inhibitors, the prr  proteins , by relieving the negative regulation of prr transcription by toc <dig> . in the model, this results in instant down-regulation of lhy/cca <dig> mrna after switching from a simulated light/dark cycle to constant light  conditions. figure 2a demonstrates that the simulated toc <dig> mutant has lhy/cca <dig> at  <dig> -fold the peak level in wild type after two days in ll, which is close to the experimentally observed  <dig> -fold for lhy mrna . in contrast, the toc <dig> mutant simulated in the p <dig> model initially contradicts the data, as it first shows an increase of lhy/cca <dig> levels followed by only a slight decrease , and through a more indirect mechanism  <cit> .

over-expression of toc <dig> also resulted in a lower level of lhy/cca <dig> expression, which is due to the direct suppression of lhy/cca <dig> expression by the increased level of the repressor, toc <dig> . this effect of toc <dig> was present already in the p <dig> model. however, the p <dig> model failed to describe the longer period of the toc1-overexpressor line  under constant light, which was observed in the data  <cit> . the discrepancy in the earlier model was caused by increased levels of the prr inhibitors as well as toc <dig>  which resulted in a reduction of the lhy/cca <dig> level. this led to a shortening of the period in the simulated toc1-ox lines in p <dig> rather than a longer period. the current model describes the experimentally observed prolongation of the period due to delay in lhy/cca <dig> in toc1-ox compared to the wild type because repression by toc <dig> reduces the level of the other prrs . the simulated toc1-ox in figure 2a has a  <dig>  h longer period than the wild type. the period difference between the toc1-ox and wild type increases with the increase in the level of toc <dig> expression in our model, in agreement with the data  <cit> . for example, 3-fold increase of the toc <dig> overexpression level compared to the level shown in figure 2a results in 5 h longer period of the toc1-ox compared the wild type . the large prolongation of the toc1-ox period  corresponds to the experimental observations for the toc1-ox lines with high overexpression levels of toc <dig> <cit> . the oscillations are damping in toc1-ox in our model simulations  similarly to the data  <cit> , to the point of the loss of rhythmicity of the simulated toc1-ox at very high levels of toc1-overexpression, which also agrees with the data  <cit> . the model suggests that the period increase is due to the simultaneous up-regulation of toc <dig> and down-regulation of the other prr expression in the toc1-ox lines, which allows a longer interval of lhy/cca <dig> expression than in the wild type.

figure 2c shows schematically the mechanisms of regulation of lhy/cca <dig> expression by the wave of prr inhibitors in lines with different levels of toc1: in the toc <dig> mutant, increased prr levels reduce lhy/cca <dig> levels, while the absence of toc <dig>  the last inhibitor, shortens the period. in toc1-ox, lhy/cca <dig> expression is repressed mainly by toc <dig> protein, which declines when lhy is raising  and thus allowing oscillations to occur but with longer period than in wild type . thus the model offers an explanation of the low lhy and cca <dig> levels in the toc <dig> mutant  <cit>  that is consistent with the biochemical data showing that toc <dig> is a repressor  <cit> . the mechanism depends upon the inhibition of multiple clock genes by toc <dig>  particularly the prrs .

additionally to affecting the expression of the morning genes lhy/cca <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig>  prr <dig>  toc <dig> negatively regulates the evening genes lux , elf <dig>  and gi  in the experimental data  <cit>  and in our model. this is in clear contrast with the p <dig> model, where toc <dig> affected only lhy/cca <dig> expression directly. the new model suggests that increased levels of evening gene expression result in the arrhythmia of the lhy/cca1/toc <dig> triple mutant under constant light conditions, as opposed to the damped oscillation of the lhy/cca <dig> double mutant. this agrees with experimental observations  <cit> .

toc1-mediated effects of aba on circadian timing
figure 3a shows simulated diurnal profiles of toc <dig> expression under increasing aba levels, which might correspond to increasing levels of stress, such as drought  <cit> . in agreement with the data  <cit> , aba accelerates toc <dig> expression in the afternoon. the up-regulation of toc <dig> under higher aba levels resulted in the suppression of expression of toc <dig> target genes in our simulations , which agrees with the data  <cit> . the model also suggests that the up-regulation of toc <dig> by aba should lengthen the circadian period  under free-running conditions , similar to the toc1-ox line . this agrees with the experimental observations, showing periods about  <dig>  h longer than wt in the expression of the clock output gene cab <dig> in plants treated with high exogenous aba concentrations  <cit> .

altogether, the extension of the p <dig> model including the widespread repression of core components by toc <dig>  and the inclusion of the regulatory function of aba on toc <dig> expression allowed us to improve the description of multiple datasets on the clock kinetics in wild type and mutant plants, and suggest mechanisms to explain previously paradoxical data.

gating of aba signalling by the clock
we next examined the biological relevance of the interactions between aba and the circadian clock. to that end, we extended the model to the regulation of an important physiological process downstream of the clock - stomatal aperture. the equation for stomatal aperture describes the regulation of stomatal dynamics by light and by aba signals  <cit> . the simulated diel kinetics of stomatal aperture are shown on figure  <dig>  together with data from wild-type arabidopsis plants in the same conditions  <cit> . light activation results in a more open state of stomata during the day than in the night, in agreement with the experimental data  <cit> . stomatal dynamics also have a pronounced diurnal pattern related to aba signalling as discussed below. figure 5a shows simulated stomatal dynamics under different aba levels. increased aba levels correspond to drought conditions, which lead to a more closed state of stomata, in agreement with the data  <cit> . the closing of stomata by aba is a well-known physiological response in plants, which is important for the reduction of transpiration under drought  <cit> . additionally to the modulation of the average daily size of the stomatal pore, aba regulates the peak and trough phases of stomatal aperture. in the model, aba signal is gated by the clock through abar transcription in the morning and the following gradual increase of snrk <dig>  activity during the day . the snrk <dig> kinase in turn regulates multiple downstream processes including the dynamics of stomatal aperture  <cit> , as described in the methods. figure 5a demonstrates that the resulting diurnal timecourse of stomata aperture is characterized by a morning peak with some decline towards dusk –“dusk anticipation”, resulting from higher sensitivity of stomata to aba in the afternoon. similarly, stomata are less sensitive to aba before dawn, which results in an increased stomatal aperture before dawn – “dawn anticipation”. both dawn and dusk anticipations agree with the data  <cit>  and are important for closing stomata in the heat of the afternoon to reduce a water loss and opening of stomata in the cool of the morning to prepare plants for photosynthesis after dawn  <cit> . the modelling here allowed us to describe the data on stomatal dynamics and showed that circadian regulation of abar transcription was consistent with the gating of the aba signalling by the circadian clock and the resulting rhythmic stomatal dynamics.

the circadian regulation resulted in distinctive, free-running rhythms of stomatal opening under constant light conditions for simulated wild type and mutant plants , similar to those observed experimentally  <cit> . the period of this rhythmic clock output corresponded to the one of the clock itself in our simulations, in agreement with data  <cit> . figure 5b demonstrates this for the short- and long-period mutants toc <dig> and prr7/prr <dig>  additionally to the change in period length, the simulated toc <dig> mutant had smaller stomatal aperture compared to wild type . to explore the effect of toc <dig> on stomata in more detail, we compared the dynamics of stomata in wild type, toc <dig> mutant and toc1-ox lines. figure 6a demonstrates that the simulated stomata were more open in the toc1-ox and more closed in the toc <dig> compared to wild type, which fully agree with the experimental observations  <cit> . this effect was due to the direct inhibition of abar expression by toc <dig>  simulation of the model showed that this effect was especially pronounced under high aba levels . additionally, the model suggests that toc <dig> regulation will alter the diurnal gating of the stomatal response to aba, because both simulated toc1-ox and toc <dig> mutant lines had less pronounced anticipation of dawn and dusk .

CONCLUSIONS
the revised clock model explains clock gene profiles of mutants with altered toc <dig> expression, resulting from the pervasive transcriptional repression by toc <dig>  the model was extended to explore the mutual connections between toc <dig> targets and aba signalling, resulting in downregulation of clock gene expression and lengthening of the free running period under high aba conditions. moreover, toc1’s participation in the rhythmic gating of aba signalling can explain well-characterised rhythms in physiological processes downstream of aba, such as the regulation of stomata aperture. the clock effects on stress signalling are significant at the whole-plant level, as plant survival under dry conditions was reduced in toc1-ox plants and increased in toc <dig> mutants  <cit> . moreover, the close overlap between toc1- and aba-regulated genes in transcriptome profiles  <cit>  suggests that other aba-mediated stress responses are similarly responsive to toc <dig>  integrating such physiological response pathways, even if they are represented in a simplified way, with the clock model will allow to expand our knowledge on the temporal regulation of plant physiology in its normal context, the unavoidable day-night cycle.
