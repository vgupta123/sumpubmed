BACKGROUND
for a pathogen to successfully infect a host plant, the pathogen must overcome several layers of innate immunity and reprogram the plant cells; this reprogramming allows the pathogen to evade host defences and colonise the plant. plant defence responses can act in two waves. first, perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors at the plant cell surface causes activation of basal defence responses  <cit> . pathogens suppress these basal defence responses by secreting an array of effector proteins from specialized feeding structures, called haustoria in filamentous pathogens  <cit> . effector proteins remodel the plant cell’s circuitry for the benefit of the pathogen. second, in resistant plant genotypes, plant immune receptors  recognize these effector proteins and activate a second wave of defence responses. this second wave includes localised cell death, known as the hypersensitive response.

recent studies have characterised changes in gene expression in plant pathogens during infection. for instance, studies on fusarium oxysporum  <cit> , melampsora larici-populina  <cit> , phytophthora infestans  <cit> , and magnaporthe oryzae  <cit>  have addressed how genes, particularly those involved in immunity, are regulated at the host-pathogen interface. however, few studies have focused on the pucciniaceae, a family of fungal pathogens that constitutes the largest group of plant pathogens characterised to date, as most transcriptomic studies on this family have focused on effector identification and characterisation  <cit> .

the pucciniaceae infect an array of food crops and pose a substantial threat to global food security. for instance, yellow rust disease, caused by the fungus puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , endangers wheat production worldwide, leading to complete crop loss when left untreated  <cit> . as an obligate biotroph, the pst pathogen is dependent on its host for survival and propagation. yellow rust disease begins when aerial spores land on a leaf and/or other green tissues of a susceptible wheat variety in environmental conditions favorable for the establishment of disease. the pathogen enters its host through stomata and proliferates by generation of invasive hyphae in the mesophyll layer. these hyphae produce haustoria, which form intimate connections with plant cells through invagination of the host cell membranes  <cit> . in a susceptible host, the pathogen can evade the plant’s innate immune system and manipulate the plant cells to acquire nutrients and enable colonization. the pst asexual reproduction cycle is then completed by the production of urediniospores, which burst through the leaf surface  <cit> . although the asexual infection cycle of yellow rust on wheat has been well documented morphologically, we know very little about the cellular processes that occur in the pathogen and host during infection.

in this study, we used a transcriptome-based approach to characterise the rust-wheat interaction and uncover pivotal events that may lead to parasitism. we used rna-seq  <cit> , which provides a method for unbiased quantification of expression levels. since rna-seq does not require a genome sequence, it allows simultaneous analysis of host and pathogen transcriptomes, thus enabling us to assess how pathogens regulate the expression of their molecular components for disease progression and how they influence the host plant’s circuitry during a susceptible reaction  <cit> .

we defined the global gene expression profiles for pst and its wheat host, identifying clusters of differentially expressed host and pathogen genes to reveal significant enrichment of genes associated with the defence response, signaling, and metabolism of protein and fatty acids. we were able to visualise the activation of these defence components and the downstream host immune receptors upon infection with pst. our data showed that the expression of these defence components persisted in an incompatible interaction, but was rapidly suppressed in a compatible interaction. numerous studies have reported the suppression of individual immune components during pathogen invasion and our results establish that pathogen invasion also involves sequentially and temporally coordinated activation and suppression of a suite of immune response regulators. our work thus describes the global expression levels and patterns for these key defence components in compatible and incompatible interactions, and provides insight into pathogen suppression of host gene expression to enable colonization of a susceptible host.

RESULTS
gene expression profiling of the host-pathogen interface
to characterise gene expression profiles in wheat and pst during infection, we performed an rna-seq time-course. we inoculated a highly susceptible wheat variety  with pst strain 87/ <dig> and harvested leaf samples at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 11 days post-inoculation . germinating pst spores were also collected as a control. for each time point, three biological replicates were used to generate a total of  <dig> poly enriched cdna libraries, which were sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. following quality filtering and data trimming, high-quality reads were aligned to both the wheat and pst- <dig> reference genomes  <cit> . the percentage of reads that aligned to the wheat reference decreased from a maximum of  <dig>  %  at  <dig> dpi to  <dig>  %  at  <dig> dpi . less than 1 % of reads mapped to the pst- <dig> reference genome at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, similar to the results observed in the uninoculated plant control . therefore, these time points were not included in downstream analysis of the pathogen. at later time points, the proportion of reads aligning to the pst- <dig> reference increased from  <dig>  %  at  <dig> dpi to  <dig>  % at  <dig> dpi .fig.  <dig> an initial depression in the percentage of reads mapping to the wheat genome early in infection could be restored by supplementing the wheat genome with plant-derived de novo assembled transcripts. a alignment of rna-seq data from the various time points during infection to both the wheat host and pst- <dig> pathogen reference genomes revealed a notable drop in the percentage of reads mapping to the wheat reference genome specifically at 3 days post inoculation . b the wheat reference genome, generated by the international wheat genome sequencing consortium , was supplemented with plant transcripts from a de novo assembly of the unmapped rna-seq reads. alignment of the rna-seq data to this combined reference  restored the previous depression at  <dig> dpi



improving the pst gene models
when using the previously published pst- <dig> gene models  <cit>  we found that a high percentage of reads  that mapped to the pst- <dig> genome did not align to predicted exons . therefore, we used our transcriptome data to generate an updated set of transcript annotations using the software cufflinks  <cit>  and the reference annotation based transcript  assembly pipeline  <cit> , which generated a minimal set of predicted transcripts that best explained the observed spliced rna-seq alignments. this significantly reduced the number of reads mapping to intergenic regions . rna-seq alignments with short intergenic lengths indicate the presence of overlapping genes incorrectly characterised as distinct loci  <cit> . in accordance, our updated pst transcripts have intergenic regions that are  <dig>  times longer than those in the original gene models and consist of multiple domains that were previously defined as separate genes .

coding and untranslated regions  were then identified in the new set of pst transcripts using transdecoder and a predicted proteome was generated  <cit> . we identified a total of  <dig>  distinct genomic loci that encoded  <dig>  expressed transcripts with significant orfs. this new proteome was then annotated using the ebi interproscan tool  <cit> . this approach led to the annotation of  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  putative protein-coding genes .

identifying wheat transcripts expressed during infection
for the wheat host, the proteome was defined from a set of  <dig>  previously identified gene models  <cit>  and interproscan annotated a total of  <dig>  genes  <cit> . predicted proteins were assigned to orthologous groups in the kegg database using the ghostkoala mapping tool  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  % of host proteins were assigned, with  <dig>  % of these showing similarity to proteins from monocots .

we observed a drop in the percentage of reads mapping to the wheat reference genome specifically at  <dig> dpi . as the wheat genome is currently incomplete, we examined the unmapped reads to determine whether this drop was due to the expression of transcripts currently not represented in the wheat genome assembly. we undertook a de novo assembly of the unmapped reads and used sequence similarity searches against the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant  protein database to annotate the newly assembled transcripts. of the  <dig> , <dig> total transcripts generated,  <dig> , <dig>  could be annotated using this method. among these blast-annotated transcripts, we selected transcripts for which hits matched a plant-related protein , including sequences from  <dig> different species with  <dig>  % being monocots. to avoid redundancy, we removed ambiguous sequences using the cd-hit-est programme  <cit>  and combined the wheat genome with these  <dig>  new, non-redundant transcripts. aligning our rna-seq data to the combined wheat reference removed the decrease at  <dig> dpi in the percentage of reads that mapped to the genome .

comparison of rna-seq quantification methods
the next step was to quantify the expression of pst and wheat transcripts during infection. properly accounting for the sampling process and inherent biases in rna-seq approaches requires sophisticated statistical inference techniques  <cit> . raw read counts or simplistic normalization such as counts per million  mapped reads are insufficient, particularly when considering alternative splicing and reads that map to multiple locations. to evaluate the performance of these statistical inference techniques and select the most appropriate method for our data, we first generated two test datasets that consisted of triplets of homoeologous genes from each of the a, b, and d genomes. these datasets included  <dig>  triplets mined from the ensembl plants triticum aestivum portal, and a subset of  <dig> triplets identified as core eukaryotic genes . as a metric for comparison of the methods, we considered both the mean pairwise cosine similarity, which measures the similarity in shape of the temporal expression pattern independent of the magnitude, and the mean pairwise euclidean distance between sets of homoeoloci, which depends on the magnitude of expression. although recent results have suggested that sets of homoeologues have significantly biased expression levels between genomes in hexaploid bread wheat  <cit> , we hypothesise that the normalised temporal expression profiles of homoeologous genes should be comparable , particularly for triplets of core eukaryotic genes. furthermore, similar profiles of expression have been reported for the rht-a <dig>  rht-b <dig>  and rht-d <dig> homoeologous dwarfing genes in tissues of different regions of the developing wheat stem  <cit>  and in wheat homoeologues of the defence-related wrky transcription factors  <cit> .

we selected the programs cufflinks  <cit> , rsem  <cit> , salmon  <cit> , and kallisto  <cit>  for comparison, with the first two as examples of widely used programs and the latter two being newly developed ultra-fast algorithms. cufflinks gave the overall highest similarity  between homoeologues for both datasets . by contrast, rsem, salmon, and kallisto consistently gave lower levels of similarity . strikingly, the quantification methods produced contradictory results when tested on individual genes. by defining the relative difference between genes as the magnitude of their difference divided by their mean  <cit> , we found that the average of the pairwise median relative differences for the same gene between the different programs was  <dig>  and the mean correlation of the expression vectors was  <dig>  . this result is consistent with a previous study, which reported that orthologous genes between nematode species with cosine similarities >  <dig>  had matching expression profiles during development  <cit> . based on this analysis, we decided to use cufflinks to determine the expression profiles of pst and wheat in all downstream analyses.fig.  <dig> cufflinks gave the overall highest similarity between homoeologues for test datasets of triplets of homoeologous genes. the programs cufflinks, rsem, salmon, and kallisto were compared, using two datasets that consisted of:   <dig>  triplets mined from the ensembl plants triticum aestivum portal , and  a subset of  <dig> triplets identified as core eukaryotic genes 



dynamic progression of pst infection in wheat
to understand the modulation of biological processes and pathways throughout the infection process, we investigated the gene expression profiles for the host and the pathogen. first, following the cufflinks pipeline, cdna libraries were normalized to generate transcripts per million  expression values and the significance of differential expression was tested using the cuffdiff companion software with the  <dig> dpi or pst germinating spores used as controls in the analysis. a total of  <dig>  host genes and  <dig>  pathogen genes were identified as differentially expressed  between at least one pair of time points . tpm expression data for significantly differentially expressed genes were normalized and clustered into sets of genes with qualitatively similar expression profiles using the mini batch k-means algorithm  <cit> , resulting in seven clusters for the host and eight for the pathogen .

to elucidate the biological function for each cluster, manually curated groups of related annotation accessions, go term annotations, and kegg pathway memberships were tested for significant enrichment in each cluster relative to the entire proteome . for the wheat host, we identified  cluster vii, which peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi during initial penetration and was enriched for genes annotated as peptidase inhibitors, glycosyl hydrolases, and peroxidases,  cluster v, which peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi during haustorium proliferation and was enriched for genes annotated as part of photosystem ii, and genes coding for cytochromes, atp synthases, and rna polymerases, and  cluster iii, which peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi during sporulation and was enriched for genes involved in membrane transport and genes for abc transporters and chitinases. the biosynthetic and downstream response pathways for the plant stress-induced hormones salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , ethylene  and abscisic acid  were highly represented in clusters i, iii, and vii, which all had peaks of expression at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. mapk signalling was enriched in clusters i, iv, and vi, and ca2+ signalling and apoptosis were enriched in cluster i.fig.  <dig> clusters of genes with qualitatively similar expression profiles were specifically enriched in particular go term annotations and kegg pathway memberships for both the host  and pathogen . heat maps display the selection of clusters where related annotation accessions, go term annotations, and kegg pathway memberships showed significant enrichment in the cluster relative to the entire proteome. dpi, days post inoculation



for the pathogen  we also identified several clusters. cluster i, which contained genes that peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi, was enriched for genes involved in fatty acid synthesis go terms and transmembrane proteins. cluster iii, which peaked in expression at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi, was enriched for genes encoding catalase enzymes and oxidoreductase go terms. cluster ii, which was upregulated from  <dig> dpi onwards, was enriched for carbohydrate catabolism, including go terms related to glucan, glycogen, and polysaccharides. cluster iv, which peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi, was enriched in genes related to nucleic acid metabolism, ubiquitination processes, and peptidase activity go terms. cluster iv was also enriched in histone transcripts. cluster v peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi and was enriched in putative transcription factors containing the zn2cys <dig>  domain, which has only been identified in fungal proteins to date  <cit> . cluster vi peaked in expression at  <dig> dpi and was enriched in hsp <dig> proteins, which are induced during the development of infection in other fungal organisms  <cit> . clusters iii, v, vii, and viii were also enriched in transcripts for proteins that contained a secretion signal but were annotated with no particular go term .

suppression of expression of host defence genes by pst is alleviated in a resistant host
on average 25 %  of the reads at each time point did not align to the wheat or pst reference genomes . therefore, we investigated the de novo assembled transcripts from these unmapped reads by annotating their potential biological functions. we focused on identifying transcripts involved in the defence response, as the modular nature of immune receptors may have limited their assembly in the current wheat genome. we annotated the assembled transcripts that likely encode nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat proteins  using the nlr-parser tool  <cit> . we supplemented this set of nlr-encoding genes with additional genes that encode proteins with similarity to known or predicted disease resistance proteins, as identified through blast searches, and combined these two datasets . through this analysis, we revealed a peak in the number of defence-related genes expressed at  <dig> dpi in the susceptible host, when compared to other time points. this peak in expression of defence-related genes at  <dig> dpi dropped sharply by  <dig> dpi; we hypothesize that this could be due to active suppression of the expression of these host genes by pst in the susceptible host.fig.  <dig> the number of host defence-related genes expressed during infection was specifically suppressed in a susceptible interaction with pst by 3 days post inoculation . a de novo assembly of the reads that did not align to the host or pathogen genomes from both a susceptible  and resistant  interaction was interrogated for defence-related genes. we highlighted transcripts that likely encode nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat proteins  using the nlr-parser tool  and genes that encode proteins with similarity to known or predicted disease resistance proteins through blast searches 



to test this hypothesis, we generated a second rna-seq time-course by infecting a wheat variety resistant to the pst 87/ <dig> strain. for the resistant variety, we selected an avocet introgression line containing the resistance gene yr <dig> and harvested leaf samples at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi. for each time point, three biological replicates were used to generate a total of  <dig> poly-enriched cdna libraries, which were again sequenced on the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. following quality filtering and data trimming, high-quality reads were aligned to both the wheat and pst- <dig> reference genomes  <cit>  . we carried out de novo assembly of the unmapped reads and annotated the assembled transcripts using the nlr-parser tool  <cit>  and similarity searches as above. when we assessed the expression of host defence-related genes during the resistant interaction, we determined that the number of expressed genes increased steadily throughout the time-course, without the suppression at  <dig> dpi that we observed in the susceptible host . this is consistent with the hypothesis that the pathogen suppresses defence-related gene expression in a compatible interaction to enable successful colonization.

wheat homologs of the rice defensome complex show coordinate expression
to further explore the regulatory networks involved in the plant innate defence response, we integrated transcriptomic data with sequence similarity and protein functional domain searches to identify likely orthologs of interactors and complex partners of osrac <dig>  a central regulator of defence responses in rice . osrac <dig> is a highly connected core component of the innate immune response, connecting with chitin perception though oscerk1/oscebip, reactive oxygen species generation through rboh, phosphate signalling through mapk <dig>  and hormone signalling through rack <dig>  <cit> . of the ten genes we identified in fig.  <dig>  at least five have already been cloned in wheat and the interactions verified in wheat, rice, or barley . we found that the expression dynamics of all the genes in the predicted defensome were significantly correlated compared to monte carlo simulations drawn from the null model of uniformly distributed gene vectors, strongly suggesting that they are functionally linked . we were unable to confidently identify homologs of two other defence-related osrac1-interacting proteins, osccr <dig> and osmt <dig>  which are involved in cell wall lignification and h2o <dig> scavenging, respectively  <cit> .fig.  <dig> suppression in expression of components belonging to the predicted defensome in a susceptible interaction with pst was rapidly alleviated in a resistant interaction. ten genes were identified that are likely homologs of interactors and complex partners of the rice central defence regulator osrac <dig>  expression was rapidly suppressed for the genes involved in chitin perception ) and defensome activation  in a susceptible interaction, but this suppression was quickly alleviated in the resistant interaction. yellow shading illustrates comparable time points between resistant and susceptible responses



we identified two groups  of three homologues of rboh, the nadph oxidase required for immune-related accumulation of reactive oxygen species ; each group contains two genes from the b genome and one from the d or a genome . for both groups, one of the b genes had lower sequence similarity to other group members  compared with the similarity observed between the other genes . the group from chromosome  <dig> was strongly induced at  <dig> dpi and the group from chromosome  <dig> was strongly induced at  <dig> dpi .

tacerk <dig> and tacebip  encode components of the chitin perception system and were strongly induced at  <dig> dpi. also, the expression of genes for the other downstream proteins peaked at  <dig> dpi. this was followed by a sharp decrease in expression of many components that then steadily increased in expression over the time course, with the exception of tarac <dig>  which returned to its basal level from  <dig> dpi onwards. tarac <dig>  despite being a central regulator of immunity, was expressed at low levels . of the three hsp <dig> variants, hsp <dig>  had the highest expression , then hsp <dig>  , and finally hsp <dig>  had the lowest expression level , which agrees with other studies concluding that hsp <dig>  is less involved in disease resistance to the yellow rust fungus compared with the other hsp <dig> genes  <cit> .

the apparent rapid suppression in expression of genes involved in chitin perception  and the defensome activation  was similar to the nlr suppression noted above. this prompted us to investigate the defensome further in the wheat variety resistant to pst 87/ <dig>  overall, we found higher expression of many components, including the receptor genes tacerk <dig> and tacebip, hop, genes for the sgt1/rar1/hsp <dig> complex, and tarac <dig> and tarack <dig> . for the downstream gene tarboh, the homologs from chromosome  <dig> and one homolog from chromosome  <dig> were strongly induced at  <dig> dpi, whereas the other  <dig> homologs from chromosome  <dig> peaked at day  <dig>  in addition, in the resistant host, mpk <dig> continued to rise above basal levels after recovering from a small dip in expression at  <dig> dpi, whereas in the susceptible host it failed to recover from this suppression and only marginally increased in expression until  <dig> dpi fig. 5). furthermore, although an initial suppression of expression levels was observed, in particular for tacerk <dig> and tacebip at  <dig> dpi, this was rapidly alleviated by  <dig> dpi in the resistant host, but this alleviation did not occur in the susceptible host.

expression of pst genes related to vesicle trafficking increases during germination and later during pathogen proliferation
transcriptional responses in the pathogen also showed changes in gene induction over time. for instance, we identified homologs of genes for fundamental vesiculotubular carrier components that are central to membrane trafficking and cargo delivery, including snare proteins, gtpases, and clathrins . these components function in all five stages of vesicle trafficking: sorting, uncoating, motility, tethering, and fusion . once we identified the sequences of these components, we combined homologs with similar expression profiles to create a minimal representative set of each with at least one representative gene. the genes were then grouped depending on their expression profile. this revealed two separate modes of expression, namely during the germination stage at  <dig> dpi and during proliferation of the pathogen at  <dig> dpi onwards .fig.  <dig> components central to membrane trafficking showed changes in gene induction over time in the pathogen. genes related to clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking  were highly expressed in pst during the germination stage  and during proliferation of the pathogen from  <dig> dpi onwards . parenthesis, indicate number of genes. the illustration in panel a, is loosely based on  <cit> 



homologs of all vesicle trafficking components followed the two modes of expression, with the exception of sec, which was unique to the late expression mode. rab gtpase proteins cycle between activation, inactivation, and cytosol-membrane translocation, regulating all five stages in vesicle trafficking  <cit> . their importance is highlighted by their consistently high expression during the active periods of both modes. the exocyst, which includes several sec proteins, is also involved in targeting vesicles to the receptor membrane  <cit> . sec transcripts were the most abundant component at all stages with a mean expression of  <dig> tpm and a peak at  <dig> dpi of  <dig> tpm . on average, the constituents shared between both modes were more highly expressed in the late mode due to a combination of more homologs per gene and higher average expression per homolog, particularly arf and clathrin with  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher expression in the late mode compared to the early mode . the identification of genes for a clathrin-coated vesicle trafficking mechanism as highly expressed during the germination stage  and during proliferation of the pathogen  indicates that this trafficking likely plays a key role during pst nutrient acquisition early in infection and during effector delivery at later stages during infection.

discussion
global gene expression profiles at the plant-pathogen interface
exploring the plant host-pathogen interface is key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that regulate disease progression. here, we used rna-seq analysis to assess the global expression profiles of wheat yellow rust and its host at various time points during infection to identify changes in gene expression that could be linked to key aspects of the infection process. the first step was to identify differential gene expression profiles across time points for both wheat and yellow rust and cluster these transcripts into sets of genes with qualitatively similar expression profiles. within the seven clusters identified for the host, we found overrepresentation of components for biosynthesis and response pathways related to the plant stress hormones sa, ja, ethylene, and aba , whose balance is fine-tuned to regulate plant innate immunity  <cit> . we also found enrichment of genes encoding proteins with antimicrobial properties, like pathogenesis-related proteins, chitinases, and cysteine-rich repeat proteins . moreover, the enrichment in membrane proteins in all four of these clusters and the expression of proteins related to vesicle trafficking in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> indicates a potential increase of uptake cargo vesicles in the host plant cell as the fungus colonizes the plant cells.

in the pathogen, we identified specific enrichment of genes encoding transcription factors containing zn2cys <dig> , peaking at  <dig> dpi . these transcription factors, which are unique to fungi, are related to the pathogenicity of the rice blast fungus m. oryaze, affecting conidial germination and appressorium formation  <cit> . we also found enrichment of transcripts related to fatty acid biosynthesis, transmembrane proteins, catalases, carbohydrate catabolism, and nucleotide metabolism, peaking specifically at  <dig> dpi . finally, we identified a notable peak in expression at  <dig> dpi for hsp <dig> proteins . in ustilago maydis, hsp <dig> is upregulated at  <dig> dpi in infected maize leaves and plays a key role in pathogenesis  <cit> . for instance, maize plants infected with a u. maydis strain devoid of hsp <dig> have reduced disease symptoms compared to the wild-type strain  <cit> . the conservation of such vital pathogenesis-related elements among distantly related fungi and, in some cases, their exclusivity to fungi, highlights these elements as candidate targets for inhibition to restrain pathogen colonization.

modulation of the host defence response by pst
in this study, we observed sequential, temporally coordinated activation and suppression of a suite of immune response regulators. this suppression occurred regardless of the susceptibility of the host, but was alleviated specifically in the resistant interaction. this provides important insight into how pathogens modulate expression of host defence components to enable successful colonization. this correlation in expression patterns of defence components with host susceptibility is consistent with observations made on infections of susceptible and resistant potato lines carrying the resistance gene rb  with p. infestans  <cit> . although the p. infestans infection induced the same suites of genes, the temporal regulation patterns of these genes significantly diverged, depending on the susceptibility of the host plant. in that case, the suite of affected genes included two specific hypersensitive response-associated genes that were expressed only in the + rb line  <cit> . furthermore, when m. oryzae was used to inoculate susceptible and resistant rice varieties, after 24 hours the early increase in expression of defence components clearly differed between the two hosts, with very few defence response genes detectable in the susceptible host  <cit> . the inclusion of further time-points would determine whether this is also consistent with coordinated temporal expression of defence response genes linked to host susceptibility to m. oryzae.

plants rely on complex surveillance systems to perceive pathogens. for instance, receptors on the plant cell surface can detect pathogen-derived molecules as signatures of imminent invasion, as in the case of the wheat receptor tacerk1/tacebip and the fungal molecule chitin  <cit> . in addition, plant chitinases, which are part of the plant defence response during infection, degrade fungal chitin and release chitin oligomers  <cit> . in wheat, specific chitinase activity is induced in compatible and incompatible interactions with pst  <cit> . in accordance, we detected an increase in expression of wheat chitinase genes during infection . however, following the rise in chitinase gene expression during pst infection in our study, we observed a strong induction of tacerk1/tacebip receptors at  <dig> dpi in both susceptible and resistant wheat varieties. furthermore, by  <dig> dpi many genes for components of the ros signal transduction pathway downstream of the tacerk1/tacebip receptors were upregulated irrespective of the host wheat variety. the proteins involved in ros signal transduction include hop, rac <dig>  and the components of the molecular chaperone complex rar1/sgt1/hsp <dig>  previous studies showed that many of the corresponding genes  were upregulated in barley at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi when the susceptible variety morex was infected with the pst isolate cy <dig>  <cit> . notably in our study, we observed that the boost in transcript levels of these defence components was subsequently suppressed from  <dig> dpi onwards in the susceptible host. in the resistant host, the expression of these defence components was also suppressed at  <dig> dpi, but the suppression was rapidly alleviated and their expression levels steadily increased after  <dig> dpi.

overall, at  <dig> dpi both resistant and susceptible wheat varieties likely perceived the fungus through the tacerk/tacebip receptors and triggered the signaling pathway required for ros accumulation. however, even though the expression of the corresponding transcripts after  <dig> dpi was detectable in the susceptible variety, only the high levels achieved in the resistant variety appear sufficient to provide an effective immune response. this could be due to a minimum expression threshold required to adequately stabilize the host immune receptors  <cit> . in accordance, the steady-state levels of the barley mla <dig> and mla <dig> resistance proteins, which are effective against the powdery mildew fungus blumeria graminis, correlate with their requirement for rar <dig>  revealing that triggering an effective resistance response requires a threshold level of rar <dig>  <cit> .

to investigate this further, we characterised the expression pattern of wheat immune receptors. we used the nlr-protein parser tool  <cit>  and similarity searches to identify transcripts that likely encode intracellular immune receptors among the transcripts that could not be mapped to the wheat reference genome. we discovered a peak in immune receptor gene expression at  <dig> dpi, compared to the other time points during infection. however, the susceptible host showed a subsequent sharp drop in immune receptor expression levels at  <dig> dpi, which was not observed in the resistant host where immune receptor gene expression continued to increase. this likely reflects active suppression or modulation of upstream signaling resulting in suppression of immune receptor expression by pst to inhibit the immune response and promote proliferation of the pathogen.

the role of vesicle transport in pst invasion
among the differentially expressed genes in the pst transcriptome, our study identified many homologs of genes that encode proteins with fundamental roles in vesicle trafficking, including snare proteins, gtpases, clathrins, and the exocyst complex. fungi use vesicular transport for hyphal and septa growth  <cit>  and likely also for nutrient uptake and pathogenesis, although this remains unclear. for instance, the p. sojae psykt <dig> snare protein is important in virulence  <cit> , and the u. maydis yup <dig> endosomal t-snare is crucial for spore formation and germination  <cit> . moreover, in the rice blast fungus m. oryzae, the t-snare proteins and the exocyst components define a distinct effector secretion system located in the fungal biotrophic interfacial complex  <cit> . this newly described secretion system seems to work independently of the endoplasmic reticulum-golgi secretion pathway for apoplastic effectors  <cit> . the recent discovery, using endosome-defective strains of u. maydis, that endosome motility is essential and required for virulence during early but not later plant infection stages, could explain the two different modes of expression of the vesicle trafficking complex that we identified, one expressed at a very early stage  and the other at later stages . the first mode may be a determinant of pathogenesis and the second could have a role in nutrient uptake and effector delivery.

CONCLUSIONS
numerous studies have reported the suppression of expression of individual immune components during pathogen invasion; here, we report sequential temporally coordinated activation and suppression of a suite of immune response regulators. this comprehensive study, which included an array of time points throughout the infection process, enabled us to document a peak in expression of wheat cell surface immune receptors at  <dig> dpi, which was immediately followed by a peak in expression of highly connected core component of the innate immune response  at  <dig> dpi. finally, a peak of expression in immune receptors was detected at  <dig> dpi. in all cases, these peaks in expression were suppressed in the following time point , a suppression that was specifically and rapidly alleviated in the resistant interaction. the inclusion of an array of early time points in our study enabled us to thoroughly document the oscillation in expression of these defence regulators, which was not possible in previous studies. the distinct expression levels and patterns of expression of these key defence components in compatible and incompatible interactions provides novel insight into how pathogens may suppress nlr expression and upstream signaling pathways to enable successful colonization in a susceptible host.

this study provides the framework for developing a better understanding of how pst causes disease. it will now be important to extend these results by examining a wider range of pst-wheat interactions. for instance, how the same host genotype responds to different pst isolates that induce compatible or incompatible responses and how isogenic wheat lines with nlr and adult-plant resistance based mechanisms differ in this response are just two of these questions. likewise, as similar rna-seq studies are undertaken for other members of the pucciniaceae family, it will also be interesting to see if related pathosystems show similar sequential temporally coordinated activation and suppression of immune response regulators. future comparative studies could reveal conserved regulatory elements that would be useful targets for inhibition to limit pathogen colonization and improve the management of rust diseases.
