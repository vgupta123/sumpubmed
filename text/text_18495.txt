BACKGROUND
oomycetes include devastating pathogens of plants and animals that can be found in almost all ecosystems and show a variety of different lifestyles . they often cause serious infections on their hosts and are responsible for huge economic losses  <cit> . understanding the evolution of these pathogens and their virulence mechanisms is key to developing strategies towards the sustainable control of the diseases that they cause.

the oomycete plasmopara halstedii is an obligate biotroph that causes the economically important downy mildew disease of sunflower  <cit> . the life cycle of pl. halstedii, described in earlier studies  <cit> , is typical for a downy mildew pathogen. disease symptoms include stunting and chlorosis, alteration of the secondary metabolism of the infected plant, reduced biomass production, damping off, and reduced seed yield, leading to reduced oil yield  <cit> . considering the devastating effects on the sunflower crop, it is crucial to develop genomic resources for pl. halstedii to achieve a better understanding of its infection biology and reveal new strategies for avoiding the loss of sunflower crop to this pathogen.

like all downy mildews, pl. halstedii is an obligate biotrophic pathogen and thus cannot be grown apart from its living host. other sequenced obligate biotrophic oomycetes include the downy mildew hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit>  and the white rusts albugo candida  <cit>  and albugo laibachii  <cit> , which are all pathogens of brassicaceae, including arabidopsis thaliana. apart from downy mildews the order peronosporales also includes cultivable pathogens, such as the well-studied hemibiotrophic pathogen phytophthora infestans, the causative agent of potato late blight, which triggered the irish potato famine in the mid-19th century . genome sequences have been published for several phytophthora species, e.g. ph. ramorum  <cit> , ph. sojae  <cit> , ph. infestans  <cit> , ph. lateralis  <cit>  and ph. capsici  <cit> . in addition, the necrotrophic phytopathogen pythium ultimum  <cit>  and the fish pathogen saprolegnia parasitica  <cit>  have been sequenced. these genome sequences have provided interesting insights into the evolution of oomycete pathogens with reference to their lifestyles, particularly the loss or gain of pathways or genes responsible for a certain lifestyle  <cit> , e.g. in the evolution of biotrophy  <cit> . in this study, the assembled genome sequence of pl. halstedii was analysed and compared to eight deeply sequenced oomycete genomes . the genome of pseudoperonospora cubensis, which causes downy mildew of cucurbit, has also been reported in the past  <cit> , but the quality of its assembly, while sufficient for general aspects regarding cucurbit downy mildew pathogenicity, does not allow for in-depth comparative analyses, leaving only one downy mildew genome, from hy. arabidopsidis, available for such studies.

the obligate biotrophic downy mildews constitute the most species-rich group within the oomycetes  <cit> , and are derived from phytophthora-like ancestors . so far, their monophyly could not be ascertained, even though runge et al.  <cit>  obtained high support for a grouping of the two major lineages of the downy mildews included in their study. based on phylogenomic investigations with limited taxon sampling, downy mildews were inferred to be the sister-group to phytophthora  <cit> , contradicting earlier reports in which downy mildews were proposed to be nested within phytophthora  <cit> .

a hallmark of downy mildews, phytophthora species, and other oomycetes is the presence of a distinct core set of around  <dig> phospholipid modifying and signalling enzymes , which might be important for pathogenic interaction . with the exception of sa. parasitica, the previously sequenced oomycetes lack the classical phospholipase c . the role of the psme in plant pathogenicity has not been fully explored, and currently, most plant-pathogen interaction studies in oomycetes focus on effector proteins .

during infection, plant pathogenic oomycetes secrete an arsenal of effector proteins that target intracellular or extracellular host processes and enable sustained colonisation  <cit> . a range of nep1-like proteins  was identified, which seem to be typical for the peronosporales, and are either inducing cell death during the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy, or, in case of downy mildews are thought to be involved in other processes  <cit> . protease inhibitors are secreted in the extracellular space  where they interact with and inhibit plant proteases to repress or induce defence reactions  <cit> . the production of protease inhibitors in oomycetes was first described in the potato late blight pathogen ph. infestans with two major structural classes:  kazal-like serine protease inhibitors   <cit>  and  cystatin-like cysteine protease inhibitors   <cit> . further transcriptome sequencing revealed the presence of both structural classes in other oomycetes  <cit> . preliminary transcriptome analysis in pl. halstedii reported one kazal-like epi effector and one cystatin-like epic effector  <cit> .

a common feature of both the downy mildews and phytophthora is the presence of rxlr effector proteins  <cit> . studies on the evolution of oomycetes revealed a high degree of positive selection in putative secreted effector proteins  <cit> . of the rxlr effectors identified in oomycetes, 44 % contain a conserved 3d structural motif based on the wy-fold  <cit> . the wy-fold is reported to be restricted to the proteomes of peronosporalean oomycetes  <cit> .

a few studies have reported pathogenicity related genes in the genome of other downy mildew pathogens apart from hy. arabidopsidis and ps. cubensis, e.g. in grape downy mildew, plasmopara viticola  <cit>  and sunflower downy mildew, plasmopara halstedii  <cit> . thus, more genomic resources for downy mildews are required for performing comparative genomic analyses with the aim to elucidate the evolution of this group of pathogens, especially in terms of pathogenicity effectors. but also some other aspects of oomycete genomics, such as secondary metabolism and hormone synthesis, have previously been neglected, despite their potential roles in pathogenicity. to contribute towards filling this knowledge gap, the genome and transcriptome of pl. halstedii were sequenced and analysed.

the aims of this study include:  conducting comparative genomic analyses with deeply-sequenced oomycete genomes for elucidating evolutionary patterns of these pathogens,  in-silico prediction and annotation of the gene space and promoters of pl. halstedii, with a focus on pathogenicity-related genes, and those involved in secondary metabolism and hormone production,  expression-profiling of the candidate pathogenicity related genes with respect to certain stages of infection,  elucidation of effector evolution, in particular the evolution of rxlr-like effectors and their canonical motifs in downy mildews and phytophthora species.

RESULTS
general genome features
the genome assembly of pl. halstedii was performed using small-insert libraries with insert sizes of 300 bp and 800 bp and large-insert mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of  <dig> kbp and  <dig> kbp. illumina sequencing of the four libraries with insert sizes of 300 bp, 800 bp,  <dig> kbp, and  <dig> kbp generated  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  millions of paired-end reads, respectively. illumina standard adapter and primer sequences were removed from these reads and further quality control  trimming was performed using an average phred quality score cut-off of  <dig> and a minimum length threshold of 72 bp. using these filters,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % paired-end reads were retained for the libraries with insert sizes of 300 bp, 800 bp, 8kbp and  <dig> kbp, respectively. all reads were assembled using the velvet  <cit>  genome assembler v <dig> . <dig> and the resulting scaffolds were compared to the ncbi nt  database using blast to check for bacterial and host plant contamination . a local database of genomes of possible contaminants was created and a mapping of the qc filtered reads on this database was performed. contamination filters filtered around one per cent of the raw reads, which mapped mostly to bacterial genomes and the genome of the host plant, sunflower. all reads which mapped to the contaminant genomes were not used in the genome assembly.

filtered reads were used to generate the final genome assembly, with a total length of  <dig>  mb, with an n <dig> scaffold length of  <dig>  mb. this assembly consisted of  <dig> scaffolds, comprising  <dig> contigs in total. the longest contig was  <dig>  kb and the n <dig> contig length was  <dig>  kb. to assess the quality of this genome assembly, the number of scaffolds and the length of the shortest scaffold of the respective class from n <dig> to n <dig> were plotted . 95 % of the nuclear genome was assembled in only  <dig> scaffolds, indicating a highly contiguous genome assembly.fig.  <dig> genome assembly quality assessment in terms of length of the shortest scaffold in each n-class and the number of scaffolds. the quality of the genome assembly was assessed by first sorting all  <dig> nuclear scaffolds length-wise from the largest to the smallest scaffold. then n-classes were defined, where n represents the percentage of genome covered by considering the assembled genome size. the length given for each n-class represents the length of the smallest scaffold present in that particular n-class. the number of scaffolds represents the number of scaffolds present in the respective n-class. the sharp rise after n <dig> represents the unresolved small contigs, the majority of which are repeat elements



the completeness of the genome assembly was assessed using the cegma pipeline  <cit> . this confirmed the presence of  <dig>  % of the core conserved genes by partial mapping and  <dig>  % by complete mapping. similar analyses on other sequenced oomycete genomes  revealed that the assembled genome of pl. halstedii is slightly more complete than those of al. laibachii and hy. arabidopsidis, while it is similar in completeness to the assembled genomes of phytophthora spp., py. ultimum and sa. parasitica . in addition, genome comparisons revealed that the genomes of the obligate biotrophic oomycetes  are more at-rich than the other species .table  <dig> genetic features of oomycete genomes

heterozygosity
the rate of heterozygosity in the sequenced isolate of pl. halstedii is very low, which is consistent with multiple generations of inbreeding  through homothallism  <cit> . only  <dig> sites per mb have a major allele frequency between  <dig>  and  <dig>  . although the global rate of heterozygosity is very low for the whole genome, we found two regions with apparently high rates of heterozygosity that correspond to predicted gene models, namely phals_ <dig> on “scaffold_2386”   and phals_ <dig> on “scaffold_350”  . each aligned sequence read-pair supports one of two apparent haplotypes . however, it is possible that these loci represent paralogs sharing almost identical sequences that erroneously assembled into single gene models. this may also explain the increased depth of coverage in this region. the extremely low levels of heterozygosity precluded an assessment of ploidy levels throughout the genome.

phylogenetic analyses
the sequences of core housekeeping genes identified by the cegma pipeline were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among these sequenced oomycete genomes. a total of  <dig> such core genes were found in the nine oomycete genomes. a phylogenetic tree, generated using raxml , revealed that pl. halstedii is nested within the phytophthora spp. with maximum bootstrap support, while hy. arabidopsidis was placed as a sister-group of phytophthora and pl. halstedii, thus refuting monophyly of the downy mildews. it should be noted, however, that the sparse taxon sampling renders it possible that the phylogenetic position of the different species is an artefact resulting from highly divergent mutation rates. the nexus file containing the tree and alignment has been submitted to dryad digital repository  and a local server .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic relationship of deeply sequenced oomycetes. the phylogenetic analysis was done by considering the core orthologous genes predicted by the cegma pipeline. multiple sequence alignments were performed using mafft and phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the maximum likelihood algorithm as implemented in raxml. number on branches correspond to support values from  <dig> bootstrap replicates



repeat elements and microsatellite markers
both ab-initio and reference-based repeat element prediction approaches were used to reveal that repeat elements make up  <dig>  % of the genome of pl. halstedii. further characterization using computational methods resulted in the prediction of  <dig> gypsy elements,  <dig> ty1_copia elements and  <dig> line elements. a total of  <dig> simple sequence repeat  markers  of potential use in population genetic studies were identified . dinucleotide motifs were the most abundant type of repeats , followed by tri- , penta- , and tetra-nucleotide motifs  . none of the most frequent nucleotide motifs represented more than 1 % of the total ssrs .

orthology
orthology analysis was performed using the protein sequences of two obligate biotrophic members of the peronosporaceae  and three hemibiotrophic phytophthora species. a total of  <dig> orthologs were detected in the five genomes. out of these  <dig> were 1: <dig> orthologs . a similar analysis was performed considering the nine deeply sequenced oomycete genomes. these analyses revealed  <dig> shared orthologs, of which  <dig> were 1: <dig> orthologs.fig.  <dig> number of ortholog groups within oomycete genomes. the number of ortholog groups among the genomes of hy. arabidopsidis, ph. capsici, ph. infestans, ph. sojae, and pl. halstedii. a number of ortholog groups found within the five genomes considering all protein-coding genes. b number of ortholog groups within the five genomes considering all psep-encoding genes. numbers in brackets represent the total number of genes tested in the analyses. asterisks denote 1: <dig> orthologs among the five genomes



a total of  <dig> putative secreted effector protein -encoding genes were predicted in the genome of pl. halstedii. by applying these methods to the other available downy mildew genome, we could predict  <dig> psep-encoding genes in hy. arabidopsidis. this suggests that both of these downy mildew pathogens require an almost identical amount of psep-encoding genes for biotrophic colonization of their phylogenetically divergent hosts. orthology analyses revealed that the nine deeply sequenced oomycete genomes share five orthologs of psep-encoding genes . orthology searches considering the pseps in the plant parasitic peronosporaceae  resulted in  <dig> psep orthologs  shared by the five genomes . our analyses suggest that there are in total  <dig>  orthologs of psep-encoding genes among the four phytophthora spp. and two downy mildew pathogen genomes. these orthologs code for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> proteins classified as serine protease, nep1-like proteins , proteinase inhibitors and rxlr-like, respectively . no secreted crn was found conserved among the peronosporaceae. however, orthology analyses of  <dig> crns of pl. halstedii derived from protein encoding genes supported by gene predictions revealed the presence of orthologs of  <dig> crns of pl. halstedii not predicted to be secreted in at least one of the eight other deeply sequenced oomycetes. out of these  <dig> orthologs, six were present in pl. halstedii and the four phytophthora genomes and four were shared by pl. halstedii and hy. arabidopsidis. only two orthologs were found among the two downy mildews and four phytophthora genomes.

notably,  <dig> psep-encoding gene orthologs were found in three deeply sequenced phytophthora genomes but in none of the downy mildew genomes . only  <dig> pseps were unique for the downy mildews and absent from the phytophthora genomes .

genome architecture
the lengths of gene flanking regions were calculated to estimate gene density in the pl. halstedii genome. this revealed that the overall means of 5′ and 3′ flanking distances are  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively . the core ortholog genes of pl. halstedii had mean 5′ and 3′ flanking distances of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb . similar analyses were specifically performed for all genes that encode psep, rxlr-like, and crinkler -like protein encoding genes . the majority of such genes are localized in regions sparser in genes  in comparison to non-effector protein-encoding genes.fig.  <dig> heat maps illustrating gene density of the pl. halstedii genome. gene density as estimated by calculating the 5′ and 3′ flanking distances of  all protein encoding genes,  core genes  non-secreted protein encoding genes  secreted protein encoding genes,  candidate rxlr-like protein encoding genes,  crn-like protein encoding genes. grey shading highlights the area with both 5′ and 3′ distances below 3 kb



promoters
the intergenic regions upstream of pl. halstedii start codons span a wide size range, which is consistent with organization of the genome into gene dense region  and gene-sparse region . about 51 % of such regions are < 2 kb, with a median size of 418 nt , suggesting that the typical pl. halstedii promoter is compact. this value is based on scaffolds containing at least  <dig> genes,  <dig>  genes in total, to avoid bias due to gaps in the assembly. the fraction of closely spaced  genes in pl. halstedii is smaller than that of ph. infestans , despite the much larger genome of the latter  <cit> .

both coding and promoter regions in pl. halstedii are more at-rich than those of most other sequenced oomycetes . the a + t content within promoters peaks at nearly 60 % about 75 nt upstream of the translation start, the region in which the transcription start site would be expected.fig.  <dig> features of promoters. a a + t content of coding regions and 50-nt intervals within promoters from pl. halstedii, ph. infestans, and hy. arabidopsidis.

prior studies of phytophthora spp. identified core promoter elements  <cit>  with a fair degree of conservation in other oomycetes  <cit> . these include the 7-nt initiator , 7-nt fpr, and 7-nt dpep elements. frequently, the inr and fpr elements  <cit>  co-occur in a 16-nt inr + fpr supra-motif. all of these elements were present in pl. halstedii . however, the motifs were less frequently detected in pl. halstedii compared to ph. infestans. for instance, the inr + fpr supra-motif was detected two times less in the downy mildew. a similar reduction in the frequency of this element was observed in hy. arabidopsidis.

about 2/ <dig> of pl. halstedii promoters lacked any recognizable core promoter motif. attempts to identify additional core promoter motifs using maximum expectation methods , using motif sizes between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides, were unsuccessful.

few of the regulatory sites identified in phytophthora were found conserved in pl. halstedii. two recent studies predicted general and stage-specific transcription factor binding sites  in ph. infestans, with a total of  <dig> motifs identified with high confidence  <cit> . approximately  <dig> of the motifs appeared to be over-represented in pl. halstedii promoters compared to shuffled promoter sequences . furthermore, most of the hits in pl. halstedii lacked the positional or orientational biases seen for most tfbss in ph. infestans. most of such motifs may not be functionally conserved in ph. infestans and pl. halstedii, however, since  <dig> also appeared to be over-represented in promoters from drosophila.

one tfbs that did appear to be conserved between the species was the ccaat box. this binds an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor that influences initiation and core motif recognition  <cit> . on average, the ccaat motif in pl. halstedii resides slightly upstream of motifs such as inr + fpr  or the inr alone. even though attempts to identify additional pl. halstedii tfbss using meme with total promoters were unsuccessful, it may be possible to identify such motifs in future studies by evaluating the promoters of co-regulated genes.

pathways related to phospholipid signalling
screening the genome for homologs of genes encoding phospholipid modifying and signaling enzymes  showed that nearly all pmse genes as identified from other oomycetes have an ortholog in pl. halstedii  with the exception of two phosphatidylinositol kinase  genes  that are absent. in addition, there is a significant reduction in the number of phospholipase d  genes compared to ph. infestans,  <dig> versus  <dig>  <cit> . also, pl. halstedii is the first oomycete to be sequenced in which the oomycete-specific trans-membrane domains-pld  class is absent. the second largest group of pmses is made up by the g-protein coupled receptor -phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases , known as gpcr-pipks , with  <dig> members in most oomycetes. this group is highly conserved as illustrated in additional file 2: figure s <dig> for gk <dig>  as in most oomycetes, there are no gene predictions supporting the presence of a phospholipase c .

secondary metabolites
an antismash  <cit>  analysis of genes and gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites detected the presence of four loci encoding nonribosomal peptide synthetases   <cit> . phalnrps_ <dig> and phalnrps_ <dig> show a two-domain structure with an adenylation  domain with unknown amino or 2-ketocarboxylic acid specificity and a thiolation  domain . blastp searches revealed that nrps_ <dig> and nrps_ <dig> are widespread in fungi and oomycetes. the phalnrps_ <dig> operon encodes an a-t didomain nrps and has a flanking gene encoding a pqq binding protein, which might be involved in the reductive release of the t domain-bound thioester   <cit> .

phalnrps_ <dig> is an unusual monomodular nrps with a four-domain composition: an n-terminal thioesterase  domain followed by an a and a t domain and a c-terminal reductase  domain potentially involved in reductive release of the bound thioester   <cit> . the coexistence here of the te and red domains is uncommon as both usually act on the c-terminus of the nrps-build peptide chain. interestingly, nrps_ <dig> homologs are also present in other oomycete genomes including ph. infestans and ph. sojae. although the function of the n-terminal te domain is unknown it might be involved in precursor supply for the a domain.

phytohormones
phytohormones are a group of metabolites that are also potential virulence determinants. the close coevolution of downy mildews with their hosts renders it possible that the former have acquired the ability to produce hormones to manipulate their host plants in addition to secreting effector proteins. thus pathways leading to the production of plant hormones were investigated in detail. one of the crucial pathways that can lead to the production of salicylate and auxin originates from the shikimate pathway that catalyses the stepwise conversion of erythrose-4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate to chorismate. comparable to other oomycetes and plants, in pl. halstedii all steps are catalysed by the pentafunctional arom complex. examination of genes involved in the salicylate biosynthesis pathway that branches from chorismate via isochorismate to salicylate neither identified an isochorismate synthase nor an isochorismate pyruvate lyase, rendering it unlikely that salicylate is synthesized by pl. halstedii. even though all enzymes are present in the genome to enable synthesis of l-tryptophan from chorismate, an important precursor of auxin production , none of the enzymes involved in indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis was found. it thus seems highly unlikely that auxin derivatives are synthesized by pl. halstedii.

we could further identify all enzymes needed for the biosynthesis of geranyl-gernayl-pp from acetyl-coa but no key enzymes for diterpenoid biosynthesis . therefore the biosynthesis of gibberellins by pl. halstedii is unlikely. the pathogen has the potential to synthesize phytoene from geranyl-geranyl-pp via phytoene synthase but none of the genes encoding the downstream enzymes such as phytoene desaturase was identified. it is therefore unlikely that pl. halstedii is able to synthesize complex carotenoids, abscisic acid derivatives or strigolactones .

despite the absence of most genes encoding proteins involved in the production of phytohormones, candidates encoding all key steps of cytokinin production were present in the genome of pl. halstedii . we can therefore speculate that pl. halstedii produces cytokinins. in addition, all the enzymes required to produce brassinolide from campesterol  seem to be present. based on the identification of two potential cholesterol transporters we hypothesize that sterols are obtained from the plant and converted into campesterol. brassinolide together with cytokinins might be important virulence factors and contribute to the dwarfing and stunting of infected sunflower plants. the potential capacity of plant hormone biosynthesis in pl. halstedii has been summarised in additional file  <dig> 

necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide  <dig> -like proteins 
plasmopara halstedii has  <dig> nlp genes  and one nlp pseudogene . of these  <dig> genes, there are two type  <dig> nlps and  <dig> type 1a nlps, which are distinguished based on substitutions in the cation binding pocket that is required for induction of necrosis by cytotoxic nlps  <cit> . features of these nlps have been listed in additional file  <dig>  remarkably, one of its type  <dig> nlps  is very closely related to the non-cytotoxic hy. arabidopsidis hanlp <dig> protein  <cit> , including the presence of the n-terminal q-rich region and a second disulphide bridge . multiple sequence alignments and sequence features of all nlps are given in additional file 2: figure s <dig> 

plasmopara halstedii-specific expansion of type 1a nlps, similar to that observed in hy. arabidopsidis  <cit> , is depicted in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  which shows two expanded groups of pl. halstedii nlps. group  <dig> clusters with phytophthora nlps, while group  <dig> clusters with several nlps of bremia lactucae  <cit> , the lettuce downy mildew pathogen, representing a potential apomorphy of the group of downy mildews with pyriform haustoria. three nlps  group together with hanlp <dig> and type 1a nlps of other peronosporaceae. phals_ <dig> is most closely related to br. lactucae nlp <dig> . while the expanded hanlps group in one clade, the phalnlps display two divergent species–specific expansions .

the low number of phalnlp pseudogenes is remarkable compared to the situation in the hy. arabidopsidis genome where  <dig> hanlp genes and  <dig> hanlp pseudogenes were identified  <cit> , and in the phytophthora sojae genome where  <dig> psnlp genes and  <dig> psnlp pseudogenes were identified  <cit> . in pl. halstedii  <dig> phalnlp genes were identified, yet only one phalnlp pseudogene ; the latter has a premature stop codon when compared to its most closely related phalnlp gene phals_ <dig> .

in total,  <dig> phalnlps showed induced expression during infection. in particular, members of group  <dig> are up-regulated during infection, compared to their expression in spores, suggesting the identified phalnlp proteins in pl. halstedii play a role during the infection process .

protease inhibitors
protease-inhibiting proteins are virulence factors that impair the function of plant proteinases targeted against pathogenicity effectors. the genome of pl. halstedii has a total of  <dig> genes encoding putative kazal-like epi effectors and  <dig> putative cystatin-like epic effectors . sequence alignments of the pl. halstedii kazal-like inhibitor domains and  <dig> kazal-like domains from six other oomycete pathogens show that these sequences contain the six conserved cysteines with the consensus pattern c-x <dig> -c-x7-c-x6-y-x3-c-x6-c-x <dig> , <dig> -c . some of the serine-like inhibitor effectors in ph. infestans exhibit atypical kazal-like domains that lack cysteines c <dig> and c <dig>  we identified an independent deletion of cysteines c <dig> and c <dig> in serine-like inhibitor effectors from pl. halstedii that also results in atypical kazal-like domains .table  <dig> summary of protease inhibitor effectors from seven pathogenic oomycete species

crinkler -like proteins
the genome of pl. halstedii was searched for crn protein-coding genes. for predicting crns, both regular expression and hidden markov model  methods were used  <cit> . a total of  <dig> crns were predicted from the protein-coding genes . out of these  <dig> crns,  <dig> had both the canonical lflak and hvlvvvp motifs.

in a second approach a total of  <dig> and  <dig> sequences were derived from open reading frames  using full length and lflak hmms, respectively, which were similar by blast and hmm alignments to previously known crns. a total of  <dig> crn-like proteins matched both hmms . manual curation based on high-confidence motifs known from previous studies reduced this number to  <dig>  in total,  <dig> crn motifs encoded in orfs  and were not predicted as protein-coding genes . a total of  <dig> putative crns were identified in the genome of pl. halstedii by merging the outputs from both translated orfs containing high-confidence crn signatures and iterative hmm predictions from translated predicted genes . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , only a handful of putative crns were predicted to be secreted. out of the  <dig> putative crns, only  <dig> bore classical secretion signals based on our secretome prediction pipeline . however, in total  <dig> crns were having a signal peptide probability  greater than  <dig> . all  <dig> crns of pl. halstedii reported in a previous study  <cit>  were also present in this set of  <dig> crns.

candidate secreted proteins with rxlr-deer-like domains were predicted using both regular expression and hmm-based methods . a total of  <dig> candidate rxlr-like proteins were predicted from psep-en coding genes . out of these  <dig> rxlr-like proteins,  <dig> sequences had the exact rxlr-deer motif. features and occurrences of the rxlr-deer like proteins were further analysed  and revealed an overrepresentation of some rxlr-deer variants, e.g. kxlr-deer and rxlk-deer .fig.  <dig> features of rxlr-deer-like effectors and frequency of the rxlr and rxlr-deer-like proteins in the genome of pl. halstedii: a sequence features of the rxlr-deer-like proteins were calculated from predicted putative rxlr-like proteins. numbers in brackets represent the minimum and maximum values of distances and number in italics represents the corresponding mean value. multiple sequence alignments were performed by using mafft and sequence logos were generated using jalview. b bar plot representing the number of rxlr-like and rxlr-deer-like proteins in the predicted secretome of pl. halstedii




fourteen rxlr-like proteins  were found in orfs that were not predicted as protein coding genes, as these resided in highly repetitive regions. these  <dig> putative rxlr-like effectors represent high conservation of rxlr-deer motifs . out of these  <dig>   <dig> were masked as repeat elements by the repeat element masking pipeline. the other  <dig> rxlr-like protein-coding orfs were surrounded by repeat-rich regions and their start codon positions were not well supported. by combining both predictions from protein sequences and translated orfs from repetitive regions, a total of  <dig> rxlr-like proteins were predicted. out of these  <dig>   <dig> had both the canonical rxlr and deer motifs.

to determine whether the pl. halstedii genome encodes rxlr-like proteins with wy-folds, hmmer was used to search the predicted proteome using the wy-fold hmm. in total  <dig> proteins out of the  <dig>  protein sequences were predicted to have at least one wy-fold . among these,  <dig> proteins were predicted to be secreted, of which  <dig> contained rxlr-like motifs. the number of wy-folds present in each protein ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  in the predicted secretome, all wy-fold containing proteins had no known functional annotations except phals_ <dig>  which was annotated as similar to a reverse transcriptase.

conservation of rxlr-like effectors within phytophthora species and downy mildew pathogens
to look for orthologs of rxlr-like proteins among oomycete genomes, a subset of high-confidence rxlr-like proteins  was generated for pl. halstedii as for the four phytophthora spp. and hy. arabidopsidis. orthology predictions generated  <dig> orthologs  of rxlr-like proteins that were found in the four phytophthora spp. genomes . multiple sequence alignments of these  <dig> orthologs revealed high sequence conservation . however, only six such orthologs  were found in hy. arabidopsidis and pl. halstedii . interestingly, only three high confidence rxlr-like proteins had orthologs in each of the six genomes . their multiple sequence alignments revealed a high degree of conservation , and all were predicted to be targeted to the cytoplasm after secretion and signal peptide cleavage. interproscan searches revealed that pl. halstedii protein sequences of ortholog <dig> , ortholog <dig>  and ortholog <dig>   contain a tetratricopeptide-like helical domain , a pectate lyase catalytic domain  and a dnaj domain , respectively. only one of the three orthologous genes  had previously been annotated as a putative rxlr-effector .table  <dig>  <dig> orthologs of putative rxlr-like secreted proteins in four phytophthora spp.

expression profiling of genes encoding rxlr and crn-like proteins
in order to obtain insight into effector expression during infection, rna-seq analysis of samples corresponding to newly formed spores, and early and late stages of infection on cotyledons was performed. genes encoding crns and rxlr effectors were expressed at all three stages. some genes were up-regulated during the early stage of infection , while others were up-regulated in spores and late stages . taken together, these results suggest that stage-specific sets of crn and rxlr effector candidates are expressed during the infection of sunflower by pl. halstedii.

discussion
genome features
the assembled genome pl. halstedii has a size of  <dig>  mb. this size is similar to that of the other sequenced downy mildew pathogen, hy. arabidopsidis, which has an assembled genome size of  <dig>  mb. according to a recent study  <cit> , the estimated genome size of pl. halstedii is 100 mb, which is comparable to that of hy. arabidopsidis  <cit> . phytophthora spp. assemblies range from 64 mb for ph. capsici to more than 200 mb for ph. infestans and other clade 1c species  <cit> . the significantly bigger genome of ph. infestans compared to other oomycetes is due to repeat-driven genome expansion, with a repeat element content of 74 %  <cit> . in contrast only 39 % of the pl. halstedii genome was comprised of repeat elements, comparable to the 43 % reported for hy. arabidopsidis  <cit> . the n <dig> scaffold size for the genome assembly of pl. halstedii is  <dig>  mb, which reflects its high quality of genome. genome completeness with respect to  <dig> core eukaryotic genes is similar in the eight deeply sequenced oomycete genomes, reflecting an adequate coverage of the gene space.

to study the genome architecture of pl. halstedii, 5′ and 3′ flanking distances of all genes were calculated. these studies revealed that crn, rxlr and other psep-encoding genes were localized in more gene-sparse regions than non-psep-encoding genes, particularly than the core housekeeping genes. this situation is similar to other genomes of other oomycete pathogens  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses
unexpectedly, the two downy mildew species included in the analysis, pl. halstedii and hy. arabidopsidis, did not show a sister group relationship . while hy. arabidopsidis was placed outside of the clade containing phytophthora species, as inferred by some earlier studies  <cit> , pl. halstedii was found to be nested within phytophthora, rendering the genus paraphyletic. reasons for the disjunction of the downy mildew species could be either that downy mildews are a polyphyletic assemblage or that the limited taxon sampling, in conjunction with the comparatively high mutation rates in downy mildews, leads to an incorrect estimate of phylogenetic relationships. both multigene analyses with a larger taxon sampling  <cit>  and morphological data  <cit>  suggest the nesting of a potentially monophyletic downy mildew clade within a paraphyletic genus phytophthora. it seems likely that the question of downy mildew monophyly cannot be resolved until representatives from all major clades of downy mildews and phytophthora, especially of phytophthora clades inferred to be closely related to downy mildews  <cit> , have been sequenced.

heterozygosity
within both downy mildews and phytophthora spp., homothalism has evolved several times  <cit> , and might be an adaptation towards ensuring sexual reproduction and the formation of durable resting spores even when hosts plants are sparsely distributed. as a consequence of homothalism of pl. halstedii  <cit> , rates of sexual recombination between two independent strains are expected to be very low, resulting in pathogen strains with extremely low heterozygosity, similar to the situation in ph. lateralis  <cit> . this is supported by the present study, which reports only  <dig>  % of sites with a major allele frequency of  <dig>  to  <dig> . as only a few sunflower genotypes are grown commercially, selfing after rare events of outcrossing or parasexual recombination  <cit>  might lead to abundant pathogen genotypes adapted to a variety of sunflower genotypes lacking the r-genes that would match their effector complement  <cit> .

promoter analyses
how effectors and other genes are regulated in oomycetes is still very unclear and motif identification apart from a few basic patterns proved to be difficult. some motifs have been described with respect to general oomycete promoter structure  <cit> , and only a few stage-specific transcription factor binding sites have been identified  <cit> , so far.

phospholipid signaling
pl. halstedii harbours a set of pmses that is well conserved in respect to the ones identified in other oomycetes. a slight reduction in numbers is observed in piks whereas a large reduction is found in the number of plds. the latter resulted in the absence of one class of oomycete specific plds, the tm-pld. among the strongly conserved pmse are the gks. in phytophthora spp. twelve gks are encoded, suggestive of a unique signaling pathway that bypasses g-protein mediated signaling by direct pipk activation  <cit> . so far it is unclear, which role these receptors play in pathogenicity, but it has been speculated that they are important for sensing the host environment  <cit> . however, experimental support is necessary for testing this hypothesis.

secondary metabolites and phytohormones
secondary metabolites, and phytohormones in particular, are important virulence determinants in several bacterial and fungal pathogens, e.g. in xenorhabdus spp.  <cit> , ustilago maydis  <cit>  and fusarium oxysporum  <cit> . however, while some studies have examined the primary metabolites of oomycetes, in particular fatty acids  <cit> , little is currently known about the capability of oomycetes to produce secondary metabolites. the identification of few nrps and pks genes in pl. halstedii and other oomycetes is suggestive of the production of only few secondary metabolites; however, it has been reported that some fungal pks can produce a variety of different compounds  <cit> . monomodular nrps composed of a-t-te or a-t-red domains are responsible for the biosynthesis of quinone  <cit>  or pyrazine structures  <cit>  composed of two amino or 2-ketocarboxylic acids. as these compounds often show biological activity  <cit> , compounds derived from these enzymes in pl. halstedii might act as virulence factors or protect the host environment against competitors and might thus be promising targets for future research.

plasmopara halstedii seems to lack the capacity to produce most phytohormone classes, with the exception of cytokines and brassinolides. even though these two classes of phytohormones might contribute to the disease phenotype, it has been shown in previous studies that the stunting effects in systemically-infected sunflowers are likely to be mostly auxin-mediated  <cit>  depletion of iaa by iaa oxidase activity  <cit>  is a hallmark of this process, but it remains unclear how the pathogen interferes with the host to incite this remarkable disturbance of phytohormone signaling.

candidate effectors
all pathogenic and endosymbiotic oomycete and fungal species secrete a plethora of proteins into their hosts to manipulate host defence reactions and to enable the formation of an interface for plant-microbe interaction in  biotrophic species. most genes encoding secreted effectors are fast-evolving and show limited sequence conservation, even though some effectors have been reported to be conserved among species within a certain pathogen group  <cit> . positive selection studies in both oomycete and fungal plant pathogens have shown that effector-encoding genes are under higher selection pressure than non-effector genes  <cit> .

nlps
high numbers of nlp genes have been found in the genomes of phytophthora species  <cit> . the members of this family that induce host cell death have been suggested to function during their switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy  <cit> . it was thus unexpected that while most branches of the nlp family were not present one clade of nlps was expanded in hy. arabidopsidis  <cit> . however, no evidence could be found with respect to an induction of necrosis by any downy mildew nlp tested, suggesting an alternative role during disease development  <cit> . similar to the genome of hy. arabidopsidis, most branches of the nlp family were absent in pl. halstedii, but twice as many branches of nlps were retained. two of these have expanded into small protein subfamilies independent from hy. arabidopsidis. several of these nlps were found upregulated during infection as compared to spores, highlighting their potential importance for pathogenicity in this biotrophic pathogen.

crinkler-like proteins
crn proteins are an ancient class of proteins that has been reported to contain effectors targeted to the nucleus of the host cell  <cit> . genes encoding crns have been found in the genomes of all sequenced oomycete plant pathogens and are especially abundant in phytophthora species  <cit> . in the genome of pl. halstedii  <dig> crn-like proteins were predicted, an amount similar to hy. arabidopsidis. surprisingly,  <dig> out of  <dig> proteins with a crn signature in pl. halstedii were not predicted to contain a classical secretion signal, and the function of these proteins remains enigmatic. it is also noteworthy that while a few other pathogenicity-related genes, such as three proteases, an nlp, two proteinase inhibitors, and  <dig> rxlr-like proteins had orthologs in all peronosporaceae, no universally conserved secreted crn-like gene was identified. however, orthology of  <dig> crns of pl. halstedii with at least one oomycete species was revealed. the function of these conserved crns in pathogenicity or cellular processes within the pathogen remains to be tested.

rxlr-like proteins
a hallmark of a large fraction of cytoplasmic effectors in downy mildew and phytophthora species is the presence of a n-terminal rxlr-deer motif . while these effectors seem to be abundant in the crown lineages of peronosporaceae, canonical rxlr effectors are apparently absent in the genomes of two necrotrophic pathogens, py. ultimum of the pythiaceae and the oomycete fish pathogen sa. parasitica of the saprolegniaceae. however, the presence of possibly convergently evolved rxlr-like effectors in the genome of sa. parasitica and their translocation into the fish cells has been demonstrated  <cit> . even though albugo species seem to contain a few secreted proteins with rxlr-like motifs  <cit> , their function is currently unclear. it seems possible that they have evolved independently in the albuginaceae, which represent an ancient biotrophic lineage  <cit> . in the genome of pl. halstedii a total of  <dig> rxlr-like proteins coding genes were predicted, out of which only  <dig> were having the rxlr-deer motif typical for phytophthora species. interestingly, the genome of pl. halstedii also encodes many variants of rxlr-like effectors , including putative kxlr-deer and rxlk-deer effectors. a few proteins with a qxlr motif, previously reported from pseudoperonospora cubensis  <cit> , were also observed, but none of these had a predicted deer motif. this highlights that while in phytophthora species the majority of cytoplasmic effectors of the rxlr-type seem to have a highly conserved rxlr-motif, conservation is much lower in downy mildews, which seem to have evolved a huge variety of motifs, rendering their identification less straightforward. however, the deer motif seems to be of much higher conservation. in pl. halstedii a significant number of secreted, deer-motif containing proteins were predicted, which showed variant rxlr motifs, or which, similar to the effector atr <dig> from hy. arabidopsidis  <cit>  did not show any recognisable rxlr-motif. this raises doubts regarding the importance of the biochemical features of the rxlr-motif for protein translocation into host cells, in line with recent findings of yaeno and shirasu  <cit> , and might be suggestive of a combined action of rxlr-like and deer-like motif, either host-independent  <cit>  or involving additional proteins.

conservation of pseps within downy mildews and phytophthora species
orthology analyses were conducted for the pseps of phytophthora and downy mildew pathogens. in total there were  <dig> orthologs predicted among phytophthora and downy mildew genomes, in terms of psep-encoding genes. functional annotations of these orthologs suggest that they contain peptide bond-degrading enzymes, nlps, proteinase inhibitors and rxlr-like proteins. these genes might represent a core set of effectors which is required for infection. no secreted crn was found in the set of  <dig> psep orthologs, which was expected, as these analyses were conducted only on the psep-encoding genes. however, we could identify six orthologs of high confidence rxlr-like protein encoding genes shared by the downy mildew pathogens hy. arabidopsidis and pl. halstedii. similarly,  <dig> orthologs of such candidate rxlr-like proteins were predicted among the four phytophthora species. this suggests the presence of a conserved core set of candidate rxlr-like effectors, which potentially target basic hubs in plant defence pathways, similar to the pep <dig> effector, which remained conserved in smut genomes  <cit>  and acts as an inhibitor of conserved plant peroxidases. it is notable that only the rxl part of the rxlr seems to be highly conserved within potential core effectors of phytophthora and downy mildews, similar to the situation in plasmodium  <cit> , in which the same residues seem to play a vital role for delivering its effectors to the host cytoplasm .

CONCLUSIONS
overall it was found that the assembled genome of pl. halstedii is extremely low in heterozygosity, presumably due to its homothallism, and shows a similar amount of genome completeness in terms of cegma genes like other deeply-sequenced oomycete genomes. it is noteworthy that the genomes of obligate biotrophic oomycetes are apparently more at-rich than those of related species with other lifestyles. interestingly, phylogenomic analyses seem to refute downy mildew monophyly, although it cannot be ruled out at present that this is an artefact from low taxon sampling. however, the high degree of distinctiveness and independent evolution is supported by orthology analyses, which revealed a higher degree of gene conservation among phytophthora species than downy mildews. core promoter structures in oomycetes remain obscure, as apart from the ccaat-box, no additional conserved motifs could be identified. notably pl. halstedii seems to have the capacity to produce phytohormones of the classes brassinolids and cytokines. however, it remains to be tested in future studies, whether the production of phytohormones by pl. halstedii is important for its pathogenicity. its genome codes for some secondary metabolite clusters, including an unusual nrps with both te and red domains, but their products and their role in pathogenicity have yet to be identified. conservation of candidate effector protein encoding genes in the genome of phytophthora and downy mildew pathogens was observed, suggesting a core set of effector proteins that might play a key role in the pathogenicity of these pathogens. however, while  <dig> psep-encoding orthologs were present in phytophthora spp. genomes but absent from downy mildews, only  <dig> pseps were present in downy mildews but absent from phytophthora. functional annotations of the predicted gene models revealed several variants of the rxlr motif, while the rxl part of rxlr motif within phytophthora and downy mildew pathogen genomes was mostly conserved. in addition, several proteins in which only the deer motif is conserved were identified. taking into consideration the additional variation of the rxlr-motif found in this study, this is suggestive of a major role of the deer motif in the function of the rxlr-deer-like effectors.
