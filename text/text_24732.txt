BACKGROUND
campylobacter jejuni , a microaerophilic, spiral-shaped, flagellated gram-negative bacterium, is the most frequent cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide  <cit> . c. jejuni infections are often caused by consumption of undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk or contaminated water  <cit> . adhesion of c. jejuni to host cells plays an important role in colonisation of chickens and in human infection  <cit> . campylobacter binding to host cell receptors is not mediated by fimbria or pili, like in e. coli and salmonella <cit> . as noted in a recent review, other bacterial cell structures may contribute to interaction of campylobacter with host cells  <cit> .

in some cases, bacterial adhesion can be mediated by oligosaccharides present on the surface of host cells  <cit> . in other cases, it is a pathogen oligosaccharide that is responsible for binding to specific, lectin-like, host cell structures. for example, a pathogenic gram-positive bacterial species nocardia rubra binds to a human lectin  expressed by cells in different organs including intestine  <cit> . there is a possibility of similar lectin-glycan interactions between host cells and campylobacter. for example, c. jejuni adhesion to caco- <dig> cell receptors was inhibited by certain lectins  <cit> .

campylobacter is capable of producing a variety of glycoproteins, some of which are cell-surface located  <cit> . inactivation of the n-linked glycosylation system reduces bacterial ability to adhere to epithelial cells and thereby colonise the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . these findings suggest a possible role of some bacterial cell surface surface-located bacterial n-linked glycoproteins in interaction with host cell receptors. van sorge and colleagues  <cit>  demonstrated interaction of n-linked glycoproteins of c. jejuni with c-type lectins of macrophage galactose-type lectins . in similarity with other pathogens, the production of cell surface structures interacting with c-type lectins may assist c. jejuni in the evasion of the host immune response  <cit> .

another cell surface structure that may affect bacterial interaction with host cell receptors is a capsular polysaccharide   <cit> . inactivation of the capsule production machinery in strain 81– <dig> led to a two-fold decrease in adhesion to int <dig> cells  <cit> . similar findings were observed in another capsule deficient mutant, 81116/kpse <cit> . however, these data were not supported by complementation studies. moreover, they are in disagreement with other studies where the absence of capsule showed increased adhesion of c. jejuni strain 11168h to caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . the contradictory results may be a consequence of differences in assay conditions, bacterial strains and tissue cell lines.

in general, the capsules may play different roles in bacterial attachment. this depends on the nature of a bacterial pathogen, and on the structural features of the capsules and adhesins. for example, f <dig> capsule of a yersinia pestis prevents fimbrial adhesins from interaction with host cell receptors  <cit> , while production of a capsule by neisseria meningitidis does not affect pilc <dig> adhesin-mediated bacterial attachment  <cit> .

in this study we developed and evaluated an in vitro elisa-like assay for the investigation of c. jejuni interaction with host cell receptors. the assay was successfully used to study a role of capsule in attachment using sba  lectin as an analogue of a host cell receptor. in addition, using targeted mutagenesis  we investigated a role of peb <dig> and jlpa adhesins in this interaction. furthermore, using real time pcr, we found that peb <dig> and a capsule-related gene are differentially expressed. the results of these experiments suggest an interplay between bacterial capsule and adhesins in interaction with host cells.

RESULTS
dose-dependent specific binding of c. jejuni cells to immobilised sba lectin
in order to investigate the mechanisms and factors involved in c. jejuni interaction with host cells, we developed an elisa-like assay based on monitoring bacterial binding to immobilised analogues of host cell receptors. in this model we explored the idea that some n-link glycosylated proteins may be expressed on the bacterial cell surface, and may potentially play a role of adhesins. as glycan moieties in these glycoproteins contain terminal galnac residues recognised by sba, we used the latter as an analogue of a host cell receptor.

incubation of a suspension of c. jejuni 11168h cells with immobilised sba resulted in bacterial attachment . this binding was found to be specific as demonstrated by inhibitory effects by both galnac and a soluble form of sba in a dose-dependent manner. the inhibitory effect was detectable with as low concentration of sba lectin as  <dig>  μm . galnac also showed an inhibitory effect at concentrations over 10 μm . moreover, the bound cells could be detached in the presence of a soluble form of lectin or galnac . further confirmation of specific binding was obtained by treatment of bacterial cells with an exoglycosidase. removal of a terminal galnac resulted in a remarkable reduction of the ability of bacterial cells to attach .
c. jejuni 
11168h in the presence of 5 mm and 10 mm of soluble lectin , or 5 mm and 10 mm of galnac .

in order to further confirm that the developed model of attachment is specific and is based on the surface-located galnac moieties, we repeated the binding experiments using e. coli cells carrying the entire n-linked protein glycosylation apparatus  of c. jejuni <cit> . due to the absence of glycosylation acceptor proteins in strain e. coli xl2/ppgl <dig>  the pgl system was found to be able to glycosylate the bacterial lipo-polysaccharide, resulting in exposure of galnac residues on the cell surface  <cit>  . the results confirmed that e. coli xl2/ppgl <dig> cells are capable of binding to immobilized sba lectin in a galnac dependent fashion .

expression of peb <dig> is required for binding of c. jejuni cells to immobilised sba lectin
previous studies suggested a possible location of peb <dig> protein on a bacterial cell surface  <cit> . the purified peb <dig> protein was able to bind sba lectin due to the presence of a galnac-containing glycan moiety  <cit> . in order to confirm that attachment of c. jejuni cells to immobilised sba in our experiments is mediated by peb <dig>  we constructed and investigated the binding properties of the respective mutant. the results demonstrated significant reduction of attachment of 11168h/peb3::kan
r
, which was restored after complementation .

the results of this experiment also showed that peb <dig> mutation did not completely eliminate binding, suggesting that other glycoprotein may be involved in specific interactions with this analogue of a host cell receptor. this hypothesis was supported by reduction of the residual binding of 11168h/peb3::kanr mutant in the presence of soluble lectin .

one of the other cell surface-located proteins of c. jejuni is jlpa, which was found to be an adhesin specifically binding to heat shock protein  <dig>  <cit> . as jlpa was also predicted to be an n-link glycosylated protein  <cit> , there was a possibility that it might be responsible for residual binding of 11168h/peb3::kanr mutant. to verify this hypothesis, we constructed a jlpa mutant and tested the effect of this mutation on attachment. surprisingly, none of the three independent clonal isolates showed any difference when compared with the control recipient strain 11168h  suggesting the presence of other galnac-containing adhesins.

production of capsule has a negative effect on binding
the results shown in figure  <dig> also have demonstrated a significantly higher efficiency of binding of the non-capsular mutant of strain 11168h. these results, confirmed by analysis of three independent clonal isolates of this mutant , revealed significant increase in binding upon inactivation of bacterial ability to produce capsule, suggesting an interfering effect of the later on the bacterial interaction with host cell receptors.

peb <dig> and capsule-related genes are differentially expressed
due to antagonistic effects of capsule and peb <dig> adhesin on bacterial attachment, we hypothesized that these structures might be differentially expressed. to test this hypothesis we conducted a comparative analysis of the dynamics of kpsm and peb <dig> gene expression at different growth stages in a liquid culture using real time pcr . the results showed a dramatic increase in the level of peb <dig> gene expression at 48 hrs , whilst there was a reduction in kpsm gene expression after 24 hrs .

discussion
in this study, a model of bacterial attachment was developed. this model is based on monitoring bacterial binding to immobilized analogues of host cell receptor. although we only tested attachment of campylobacter jejuni to sba lectin, the method may have wider application for investigation of interaction of other bacteria with other host cell receptors and their analogues.

the system was successfully tested by using c. jejuni strain 11168h and its isogenic mutant 11168h/peb <dig>  using the assay, we investigated interaction of bacteria carrying cell surface located galnac residues with immobilised sba lectin. the binding was found to be specific and dependent on the presence of soluble lectin and galnac molecules, and was abolished by bacterial deglycosylation. the study suggests the ability of c. jejuni to produce various cell surface galnac-containing cell surface structures.

the sba lectin used in this study shares binding specificity with c-type lectins  produced by host cells. according to a recent study, campylobacter has the ability to interact with mgl receptors expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells , which may modulate host immune response  <cit> . human mgl receptors specifically recognise terminal galnac residues  <cit> . together with other c-type lectins, the mgl receptors may be recognised by viruses, e.g. a filovirus  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that mgl recognizes a galnac containing antigen of a helminth parasite shistosoma mansoni <cit> . despite some data suggesting a role of mgl receptors as a host defence factor, the role of these molecules in c. jejuni infection is not clear. however, there is a possibility that, via interaction with mgl expressing macrophages and dcs this pathogen may subvert host immune response. it was suggested that c. jejuni with functional mgl ligand  may decrease il- <dig> production by dcs  <cit> .

campylobacter have been known to produce a number of n-glycoproteins, including peb <dig>  <cit> . however, it was still unclear which glycoprotein is reactive with mgl. our results demonstrated that peb <dig> mutation reduces but does not completely eliminate binging, suggesting the presence of other cell surface structures responsible for attachment. surprisingly, mutation in jlpa gene, encoding another cell surface glycoproptein, had no effect on the ability of c. jejuni to bind to the immobilized sba lectin. according to other studies, jlpa mutation also had no effect on invasion of host cells  <cit> .

an isogenic non-capsulated mutant 11168h/kpsm showed an increase in binding indicating a negative effect of capsule on bacterial attachment. in addition, results of rt-pcr showed an increase of peb <dig> and a decrease of kpsm gene expression over time, suggesting that a shielding effect of capsule may be essential at the initial stages of infection, hiding bacterial cell surface structures. subsequent down regulation of cps production during colonisation may lead to exposure of other bacterial cell surface structures required for the attachment and/or evasion of host immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of this study demonstrated a complex interplay of campylobacter capsule and glycoprotein adhesins in pathogen-host interaction. the developed assay will assist in more detailed investigation of such interaction and in the development of inhibitors of attachment as novel antibacterials.
