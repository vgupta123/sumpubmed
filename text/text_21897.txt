BACKGROUND
high-throughput sequencing techniques have enabled researchers to construct dense genetic linkage maps for various agricultural crops . these high-density maps not only give detailed resolution of genomes but also provide excellent platforms to identify molecular markers for qualitative and quantitative loci associated with trait of interest. genome-wide comparative analyses allow the elucidation of chromosomal rearrangements resulting from speciation, genome evolution, and adaptation as well as the identification of novel alleles for genetic improvement within and among crop species  <cit> . a number of genetic linkage maps of species in the brassicaceae family have been generated over the past 20 years, largely focusing on commercially important brassica species. these genetic linkage maps were based on traditional dna markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphism , amplified fragment length polymorphism  and simple sequence repeats  , and high-throughput rna and dna sequence markers detected by single nucleotide polymorphism  arrays, re-sequencing or genotyping-by-sequencing technologies .

comparative mapping studies with the well-characterized relative arabidopsis thaliana revealed a common hexaploid ancestor in the lineage of the brassicas. these mapping studies also identified 21– <dig> conserved ancestral blocks of the brassicaceae . these blocks have been used extensively in comparative genomic analyses among brassica species. genome-wide analyses between the allotetraploid b. napus and its diploid progenitors b. rapa and b. oleracea have shown significant genomic co-linearity  <cit> , and functional conservation of genetic loci governing important traits has also been revealed between different a subgenomes  <cit> ; however, changes in the subgenome resulting from events such as genome duplication, inversion and homoeologous exchange have been documented in b. napus  <cit> .

in the u’s triangle of brassica  <cit> , there are three basic genomes , i.e. ar in b. rapa, bni in b. nigra, co in b. olereaca, and three sets of corresponding subgenomes in the cultivated allotetraploid oilseedbrassica species, i.e. ajbj of b. juncea , ancn of b. napus , and bccc of b. carinata . genome differentiation, due to translocation, inversion, deletion, duplication, and transposon activation would be expected to have occurred among the different subgenomes in these polyploid brassica species as a result of genomic shock during interspecific hybridization, and long-term domestication and cultivation . the extensive genetic diversity occurring within these agriculturally important oilseed species has been exploited to create novel germplasm resources in pre-breeding programs . understanding the genetic basis of the subgenomic variation among the three sets of brassica subgenomes may provide insights for genomics-based rapeseed breeding programs involving favorable allele introgression from allied species.

in the present study, we focus on b. juncea, an ancient oilseed crop which is acknowledged for its suitability for cultivation under moisture-limited  and hot conditions. b. juncea also harbors loci for resistance to blackleg disease, which is caused by the fungus leptosphaeria maculans  <cit> . b. juncea has been grown widely for oil and protein in asia, especially india and china, and other parts of the world for approximately 6000 years  <cit> . however, genetic and genomic resources for b. juncea are scarce compared with the resources for the major rapeseed crop, b. napus. the first genetic linkage map of b. juncea was constructed with  <dig> rflp markers using a mapping population derived from two canadian cultivars  <cit> . subsequently, several genetic linkage maps have been constructed using mapping populations originating from canada, india and europe by ssr and aflp markers  <cit> . recently, a high-density genetic linkage map of b. juncea was developed using rna-based snp markers  <cit> .

the availability of the linkage and comparative maps of bi-parental populations of b. juncea , and the reference sequences of the ar genome of b. rapa, and the an genome of b. napus  <cit> , has made it possible to analyze the subgenomic variation among different a genomes of b. juncea, b. napus andb. rapa. here, we report the construction of a dense genetic linkage map of b. juncea generated using an f <dig> population, derived from sichuan yellow  and purple mustard   <cit>  designated as sy-pm population, with high-throughput markers based on the genotyping-by-sequencing approach, dart-seq  <cit> . we also investigated allelic diversity and population structure among  <dig> genotypes of three brassica species carrying a genomes  that represent different geographic origins. we compared the genome-wide arrangement of sequences and the constitution of the  <dig> ancestral genomic blocks  of brassicaceae in b. juncea, b. rapa and b. napus. these results would provide valuable resources for brassica genomic studies, especially for understanding and exploring subgenomic variation among different brassica species.

RESULTS
construction of a dense genetic linkage map of b. juncea
we used a set of  <dig> representative markers, selected from  <dig> identified dart-seq polymorphic markers with less than 10 % missing rate, to construct the genetic map for sy-pm population. a total of  <dig> of the markers could be assigned into  <dig> large linkage groups, while the remaining  <dig> markers which could not be linked to any of the large groups were discarded. the  <dig> linked markers detected  <dig> discrete genetic loci on  <dig> linkage groups and covered 1579 cm  with an average density of two markers per cm. seventy-two percent  of the loci were detected by single markers, while  <dig> were defined by multiple markers and were therefore defined as genetic “bin loci” .table  <dig> characteristics of linkage groups of an intercross sy-pm population of b. juncea




the  <dig> mapped markers were used for comparative genomic analysis. in total,  <dig> marker sequences representing  <dig> genetic loci could be aligned with the genome sequence of a. thaliana , which were used to discriminate the constitution of the conserved ancestral brassicaceae blocks in the genome of b. juncea. a total of  <dig> block-units were identified in the dense genetic map of the sy-pm population . five blocks , each of which had an average of  <dig> copies, often covered large genetic regions spanning 20 cm or more  in the sy-pm map.fig.  <dig> the genetic linkage map of the sy-pm population of b. juncea. genetic loci are shown with purple bars  and longer black bars  with code number. the genetic distance for a locus is indicated for the first and last bars on each linkage group, in addition to the red scale bars. the conserved ancestral blocks of brassicaceae are labeled as a to x and are shown on the body of each linkage group except the small blocks  which are shown on the left side of each chromosome



co-linearity analysis between the a-subgenomes of different brassica species
conserved brassica blocks that were identified in the aj subgenome of b. juncea through genetic mapping  were used for co-linearity analysis with the two sequenced a genomes, i.e. ar and an subgenome  <cit> . blocks a, b and i  were the most prevalent blocks in the aj subgenome, while the blocks b  and t  were the two most abundant blocks in the ar and an subgenomes .

strong co-linearity was found among the three a subgenomes, while a few conserved ancestral blocks were apparently subjected to inversions, deletions, and shuffling  . comparing the ar and an genomes, for example, there was an inversion between blocks o and p in chromosome a <dig> companied by deletion of block m on chromosome an <dig>  but deletion of block v in ar <dig>  and a duplication of block t and b was observed in ar <dig> compared to an <dig>  the restricted alignment of the marker sequences to the ancestral blocks and the limitations of genetic mapping make it difficult to confirm the absence of blocks in sy-pm genetic map. however, several small insertions in the ancestral blocks of b. juncea could be observed, e.g. a small segment from block c was inserted in block j on aj <dig> fig.  <dig> block arrangement and ancestral karyotypes in three a subgenomes of brassica species. comparison were made among the ar subgenome in b. rapa, an in b. napus, and aj in b. juncea. the constitution of the ancestral blocks in each subgenome is arranged correspondingly. the blocks in the brackets indicate blocks or small insertion that varied among different genetic maps for the species



the three a subgenomes were compared pairwise by mapping the linkage groups a <dig> to a <dig> of b. juncea to the genome sequences of the ar and an subgenomes. as expected, good co-linearity was observed across all the compared chromosomes ; however, potential genome-wide chromosomal rearrangement events, both inversions and translocations, were detected among the three subgenomes . a total of  <dig> potential inversion events across large segments and  <dig> potential translocation events were observed for the three comparisons.fig.  <dig> chromosomal structural variations among the aj, ar and an subgenomes in brassica. the scales indicate the physical distance for the genome sequences  of ar and an subgenomes and the genetic distance for aj subgenome. a inversion events detected among the aj, ar, and an subgenomes. the a <dig> chromosomes from the three subgenomes are shown. inversion events that occurred in the other chromosomes are given in additional file  <dig>  the grey lines between the chromosomes indicate consistent alignment, and inversion events are indicated with blue lines. the letters in the body of the chromosomes indicate the large ancestral blocks. b translocation events detected among the aj, ar, and an. the translocation events involving the aj subgenome are shown with blue lines and the other translocation events are indicated with grey lines inside the circle

evolutionary analysis among brassica species with an a subgenome
to further investigate the phylogenetic relationship and population structure between b. juncea and the other brassica species with an a subgenome, a set of  <dig>  high quality dart-seq markers was used to genotype  <dig> accessions selected from b. juncea, b. rapa, and b. napus . the level of detected marker polymorphism was  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, in the two allotetraploid species b. napus and b. juncea, respectively, and  <dig>  % in the diploid b. rapa. the markers were aligned to the published genome sequence of b. rapa, b. napus, and to the unpublished draft genome sequence of b. juncea . the  <dig>  polymorphic markers were aligned with strict parameters  to the genome sequences, 43 % of the markers aligned to multiple regions, but more than half  were found to align uniquely to the a , b  and c  genomes, respectively, and were referred to as the abc-markers.table  <dig> the diverse lines of three brassica species carrying a subgenomes analyzed in this study

phylogenetic analysis of the three a-genome containing species was studied with the abc-markers. it was shown that b. juncea species was clearly divergent from the other two species, b. rapa and b. napus, which shared a closer genetic relationship . when the subset of a genome specific markers  was used to construct the phylogenetic tree, however, b. juncea showed a closer genetic relationship with the a genome species-b. rapa, and b. napus was separated from its two related a genome-carrying species . similar results were also found when the two sets of a genome markers  were used to estimate genetic distance for the three species. the a genome in brassica seems differentiated into two clades, aj-ar clade and an clade .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the three a genome contained species b. rapa, b. juncea and b. napus.
a evaluated with a set of markers  which was aligned to unique positions of a, b and c genomes , respectively; the figure shown b. juncea being separated from other two species. b evaluated with a subset of markers  which were uniquely aligned to a genome; the figure shown a close relationship between b. juncea and b. rapa, and together separated from b. napus.  <dig> accessions of the three brassica species, i.e., b. rapa, b. juncea and b. napus, were used



population structure analysis  <cit>  constructed with all the abc-markers also revealed clear genetic differentiation among the  <dig> accessions of the three brassica species . at k =  <dig>  b. rapa and b. napus shared close membership and obviously diverged from b. juncea, suggesting a unique gene pool for b. juncea, which would be mainly attributed to the b genome composition of b. juncea. at k =  <dig>  the three species were separated, however, the b. juncea cultivar silayangka  from russia and a breeding accession vige dh <dig>  of b. napus from sweden shared part membership with b. rapa, suggesting gene flow or introgression from subgenome ar to aj and ar to an may have occurred. when we evaluated the genetic structure using the a genome specific markers, the highest ∆k value was observed at k =  <dig> , and the two clades, aj-ar clade and an clade, appeared again as in the phylogenetic analysis . however, gene flow between the aj-ar clade and the an clade was also suggested, in particular from an to ar. gene flow among different a subgenomes was more obvious at k = <dig>  where a strong gene flow of aj > ar was suggested, while the b. juncea cultivar silayangka, contrarily, seems to have received introgressions from two subgenomes, ar and an .fig.  <dig> graphical representation of population genetic structure of the  <dig> brassica accessions generated using the program structure. a population structures were evaluated with a set of markers  which was aligned to unique positions of a, b and c genomes . the ∆k values were > <dig> and > <dig> at k =  <dig>  and k =  <dig> , respectively . b population structures were evaluated with a genome specific markers. the ∆k values were > <dig> and ≈  <dig> at k =  <dig>  and k =  <dig> , respectively 



discussion
high-density accurate genetic maps are essential for quantitative trait locus  analyses, ordering of sequences on physical maps , map-based cloning of genes, and comparative mapping across populations within and between species. population size, missing data, and segregation distortion of markers can affect the accuracy of a genetic linkage map  <cit> . although the original set of polymorphic markers detected with relatively high quality was as high as  <dig> , only 70 % of the markers  with high confidence  were selected to construct the linkage genetic map of b. juncea, to ensure the quality of the genetic map. to retain the sequence information associated with as many of the  <dig> mapped loci as possible, the concept of “bin loci” was used  <cit>  allowing a total of  <dig> markers to be anchored on the map .

of the  <dig> ancient karyotype blocks,  <dig> were detected in the sy-pm genetic map. the g block was not found perhaps because of the limited genetic diversity on the g blocks between the parents of the sy-pm mapping population and/or the short physical length of the g blocks in the a. thaliana, b. rapa, and b. napus genomes. we calculated that, compared with the other ancestral blocks, the g block was small in the a. thaliana  and much smaller in b. napus  genomes. only a very few markers identified among the  <dig> accessions of the three species could be aligned to the ancestral block g of brassicaceae, and also only a few g blocks have been identified in brassica genomes previously  . these findings suggested that the genetic diversity of the g blocks might be limited in brassica species, or a feature of the g block is evolutionarily conserved, which leads to few informative markers available for comparative analysis.

it is interesting and important to understand the evolutionary processes and genomic variation that occurred in the a, b, and c genome of brassica species that were domesticated by our neolithic ancestors. since the sequence information of ajbj, bni and bccc genomes is currently not yet available in public domain, we concentrated on genetic comparisons among a genome containing brassica species. in this study, the comparative analysis based on the macro-constitution of the  <dig> conserved ancestral blocks suggested that these ancestral blocks may have undergone different evolutionary processes which apparently lost or increased certain blocks in the three a genome-carrying brassica species relative to the common ancestor . from the three pair-wise comparisons between the three a genome-carrying species, assisted with a comparative genetic map and genome sequence analysis, we found considerable inversion and translocation events among the three a subgenomes . greater genomic differentiation and more inversion and translocation-like events were observed here in comparisons between ar and an than that between aj and ar, or between aj and an. it is to note that the resolution is greater when estimating divergence between ar and an based on their genome sequence assemblies than with the aj genome based on the genetic map. however, we may have over-estimated or under-estimated some of the structural variation, since it could also result from mistakes during the genome sequence assembly. despite this, the observed variation of ancestral blocks and chromosome structure among the three a genomes suggests that the three a subgenomes are differentiated by considerable genomic variation even though they share strong co-linearity. these data provide insights into the evolutionary processes that differentiate the diploid brassica sub-genomes, which will be more comprehensively analyzed and understood when the genome sequence of b. juncea, b. nigra, b. carinata will be available.

increasing evidence has shown that the b genome diverged from the a/c genome about 6– <dig> million years ago , while the a genome of b. rapa and c genome of b. oleracea may have diverged about  <dig>  mya, as determined by co-linearity and ks analyses across the genomes . the population genetic analysis of  <dig> accessions of the three a genome-carrying brassica species with a common set of abc-markers showed three clear sub-populations representing the three species, indicating b. juncea was divergent from b. rapa and b. napus, which is likely mainly attributed to the b genome composition in b. juncea and the c genome composition in b. napus . these results also supported previous hypothesis that the b genome diverged earlier from the a/c genome into an independent lineage. interestingly, when the accessions of the three species were evaluated with a-genome-specific markers, two major clades, aj-ar clade and an clade, were observed, which was quite different from the result evaluated using the abc-markers . these results were consistent with the hypothesis that both species of b. rapa and b. juncea originated from a close geographical region or the same center of origin, asia, and have closer a subgenomes, whereas b. napus originated from europe as a result of spontaneous hybridization between b. rapa and b. oleracea  <cit> . more accessions of b. rapa originating from europe should be examined in the future. herein, we used old cultivars and landraces of asian origin , which might have been less frequently involved in gene introgression. additionally, the gene flow observed between the aj-ar clade and the an clade as shown in fig.  <dig> suggested the introgression of ar to aj or an during the breeding process of the development of cultivars.

subgenomic differentiation in brassica may be significant in creating novel types in brassica species that could help broaden the genetic diversity or increase heterosis. considerable effort has focused on exploring introgression from the a genome of b. rapa or b. napus, c genome of b. oleracea or b. carinata into b. napus or b. juncea . our results support the idea that b. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different a genome progenitor than b. napus. we suggest that variation in the aj subgenome of b. juncea could be applied to the genetic improvement of b. napus. additionally, the possible divergence between the a genome progenitor of b. napus and asian b. rapa accessions would suggest that these lines would be very useful to broaden the genomic diversity of b. napus.

the dense genetic linkage map and the comparative analysis of three a subgenomes described here, will contribute to a better understanding of brassica subgenomics. this will also help in a comprehensive understanding of variation in the a, b and c genomes and efforts towards genome sequencing of b. juncea, b. carinata and b. nigra.

CONCLUSIONS
here, we described the construction of a dense genetic linkage map of b. juncea based on a dart-seq approach and compared the genome constitution of the  <dig> ancestral blocks of brassicaceae and the chromosome rearrangement events among three a-genome carrying brassica species . the genetic map of b. juncea was constructed using an f <dig> population derived from two chinese cultivars sy and pm, and contained  <dig> dart-seq markers at  <dig> genetic loci. we identified  <dig> linkage groups that covered a genetic distance of 1579 cm and detected  <dig> of the  <dig> conserved ancestral blocks of brassicaceae in the sy-pm genetic map. the chromosome rearrangements among the three a subgenomes revealed by genetic mapping and genome sequence comparative analysis, and the population genetic analysis of diverse lines of the three a-genome carrying brassica species, showed that the aj subgenome of b. juncea had a close relationship with ar subgenome, and was quite different from the an subgenome. our results support the idea that b. juncea has distinct genomic diversity, and/or evolved from a different a genome progenitor than b. napus, which could be exploited for genetic improvement of b. napus. the dense genetic map presented here will help in generating reference sequences of the different u’ triangle  <cit>  genomes and subgenomes and would further facilitate the  elucidation of genomic differentiation as a result of speciation, evolution, and adaptation of different brassica species, and  the transfer of favorable alleles between species to develop improved varieties to meet the global demand for vegetable oils.
