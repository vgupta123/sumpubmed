BACKGROUND
zinc peptidases such as matrix metalloproteinases  
 <cit>  angiotensin converting enzyme  
 <cit>  and neutral endopeptidase  
 <cit>  are involved in peptide metabolism. the peptide metabolism is activated by degradation of a wide range of bioactive peptides and therefore specific inhibitors of them have therapeutic values 
 <cit> . one of the important classes of m <dig> family  
 <cit>  is “gluzincins” which is defined by a hexxh motif including two histidines and a glutamic acid as zinc-coordinating ligands. zinc peptidases of neprilysin family are gluzincins that include several enzymes for instance, neutral endopeptidase  
 <cit> , nep <dig> 
 <cit> /soluble secreted endopeptidase  
 <cit> /neprilysin-like enzyme  <dig>  
 <cit> /membrane metalloendopeptidase-like  <dig>  
 <cit> , endothelin-converting enzymes ece- <dig> and ece- <dig> 
 <cit> , the kell blood group protein 
 <cit> , the phosphate-regulating neutral endopeptidase on the x chromosome  
 <cit> , and x-converting enzyme  
 <cit> /endothelin-converting enzyme-like  <dig>  
 <cit>  /rodent homologue damaged-induced neuronal endopeptidase  
 <cit> .

xce  is expressed in the nervous system, particularly in the medulla oblongata and in the spinal cord, presumably by cholinergic neurons such as motor neurons or striatum interneurons. the physiological function of xce was first reported from the inactivation of the corresponding gene in mice, which described the enzyme as to play a vital role in the nervous control of respiration 
 <cit> . benoit et al. found that xce is mostly located in the cellular endoplasmic reticulum  consistent with the high mol. wt smears observed on sds-page, while only less than 10% portion of the enzyme reaches the cell surface. they also suggested the enzyme’s function in both compartments i.e., er and the cell surface 
 <cit> . er is considered as a target organelle for xce to suppress stress due to responding of the enzyme to nerve injury 
 <cit> . the presence of xce at the cell surface refers one of the enzyme’s functions to the regulation of the activity of extracellular peptides like other family members such as ece- <dig> and nep performed. several candidate neuropeptides such as endothelin, galanin, calcitonin, bradykinin, met- and leu-enkephalins, and somatostatin were considered as potential substrates for xce activity. particularly, galanin was supposed to be the most probable one because of its presence and degradation in spinal cord/cerebrospinal fluid. inhibition of the galanin degradation was reported to be done only by phosphoramidon 
 <cit> , but none other inhibitors were found active against xce 
 <cit> . the enzyme was found active only against a synthetic tripeptide substrate 
 <cit> , but so far, no obvious reason of the inactivity of xce against potential neuropeptides has been reported in the literature inspite of they linked its subcellular localization with the lack of success in the identification of extracellular substrate. more work is therefore needed to identify its extracellular substrates to answer questions concerning the enzyme’s precise function.

contrary to xce, its well studied homologue ece- <dig> can efficiently cleaves variety of substrates. ece- <dig> exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer invivo and cleaves the w21-v <dig> bond in big endothelin- <dig> , a potent vasoconstrictor 
 <cit> . the monomeric c412s mutant of rat ece- <dig>  has been shown to have much lower efficiency for the cleavage of big et- <dig> as compare to the wild type showing dimerization of ece- <dig> which is preferred for effective conversion of big et- <dig> into et- <dig> 
 <cit> . furthermore, m. v. hoang and a. j. turner established that ece- <dig> also cleaves the unrelated bradykinins  at a significant rate, in addition to its in-vivo substrate big et- <dig> , thereby acting as a peptidyl dipeptidase. the lack of sequence similarity in the bk peptides and the peptidyl dipeptidase revealed broad specificity and additional physiological roles for ece- <dig> possibly linked to its subcellular location 
 <cit> . moreover, recombinant ece- <dig> was found to have minimal activity against small substrates , such as leu-enkephalin. however, large peptides such as neurotensin, substance p, bradykinin, and the oxidized insulin b chain were also observed to be hydrolyzed by the enzyme as efficiently as the big et- <dig> 
 <cit>  was. in spite of various natural substrates known upto date, the detailed mechanism of the cleavage of the substrates for such a variable length and unrelated sequences is still lacking for ece- <dig>  hence, the understanding of extracellular substrate activities of ece- <dig> and xce remain challenging despite of their several activity profiling experiments because of the lack of appropriate structural knowledge.

because of the difficulties encountered in the crystallization of proteins specially of the membrane proteins, homology modeling is being served as a valuable tool since last two decades to solve the three-dimensional structures of proteins having at least one x-ray crystal structure of homologous protein 
 <cit> . for neprilysin family, initially crystal structure knowledge of thermolysin, a bacterial protein, was used to model the structural features of these proteins. crystal structure of neutral endopeptidase , the only well characterized member opened new door to acquire structural knowledge of several members of this class of the protein 
 <cit> . the three-dimensional structure of ece- <dig> was also solved with the co-crystallized metalloprotease inhibitor phosphoramidon  
 <cit> . xce shared much identity with ece- <dig> and was also identified as ece-like protein, therefore the crystal structure coordinates of ece- <dig> was utilized to rationalize the structural facts of xce. here, the three-dimensional structures of xce with and without the metalloprotease inhibitor i.e., phosphoramidon were modelled. however, a molecular-level understanding of the function of a biological macromolecule requires knowledge of both its structural and dynamical properties. the dynamical flexibility of both proteins in their inhibitor bound and unbound forms were explored by molecular dynamics  simulations. our aim is to identify the structural differences between the modeled xce and ece- <dig> by elucidating conformational flexibility of both the enzymes. the characterization of structure and dynamics of both proteins and in particular their subsites with respect to phosphoramidon would be significant to understand the structural differences responsible for their different substrate specificities and to design specific inhibitors against both zinc peptidases.

RESULTS
homology modeling
in the absence of experimental structures, computational methods are used to predict 3d protein models to provide insight into the structure and function of proteins. there are several successfull examples where homology modeling has aided in the prediction of protein function 
 <cit> . however, the choice of template, inaccurate alignments and inefficient refinement methods are still the main sources of errors in homology modeling 
 <cit> . we therefore critically checked the modeling of xce at every step from template alignment to refinement before validating the final model from external sources.

sequence conservation between both proteins
primary sequence alignment showed that amino acid residues 1– <dig> in xce could not be modeled due to lack of equivalent residues in ece- <dig> structure. therefore, r <dig> is considered as the first amino acid of the ectodomain of xce model which is aligned with s <dig> of ece- <dig> as depicted from figure 
 <dig>  final alignment comprised of  <dig> gaps in xce sequence, and these gaps are not longer than  <dig> amino acids. three characteristic motifs, 565vnayy <dig>  607helth <dig>  and 667eniad <dig> of ece- <dig>  hallmarks of the m <dig> family of zinc peptidases, are conserved and correspond to 570lnayy <dig>  612helth <dig>  and 672eniad <dig> motifs in xce respectively. the presence of vnayy motif in ece- <dig> is responsible for the specificity towards big endothelins binding whereas semi-conserved lnayy motif in xce may have influence on the binding of substrate 
 <cit> . two histidines h <dig> and h <dig> in the helth motif and one glutamate e <dig> in the eniad motif coordinate to the catalytic zinc  in xce. corresponding to e <dig> of ece- <dig>  e <dig> of xce is believed to act as a nucleophile which promotes the attack of zinc-bound water molecule on the scissile peptide. the resulting transition state formed during hydrolysis of substrate gets stabilized by h <dig> in xce corresponding to h <dig> of ece- <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> of ece- <dig> form asp-his-zinc triad to place zinc atom appropriately for catalysis and identical role can also be predicted for the conserved d <dig> and d <dig> in xce. finally, the evaluation of stereochemical properties is presented by the ramachandran plot provided as additional file 
1: figure s <dig> 

comparison between protein-inhibitor complexes
the docked conformation of phosphoramidon in the modelled xce is compared in terms of its interaction with the x-ray bound conformation of ece- <dig>  figure 
2a represents the docked conformation of phosphoramidon in complex with xce whereas the x-ray bound conformation of phosphoramidon with ece- <dig> is shown in figure 
2b. the plausibility of the enzyme inhibitor complex in zinc peptidases is primarily strengthened by the backbone hydrogen bond contributors from “nayy” motif. the carbonyl oxygen of a <dig> in xce created a weak hydrogen bond with the p1’ amide nitrogen of phosphoramidon in a similar manner as formed by a <dig> in ece- <dig>  two hydrogen bonds were found for n <dig> of ece- <dig> with the p2’ amide nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the terminal carboxylate while its equivalent n <dig> of xce maintained only one h-bond with the p2’ amide nitrogen. in xce, however, v <dig> of ece- <dig> was replaced with l <dig> amino acid, but hydrogen bonds between the p2’ indole moiety of phosphoramidon and their carbonyl oxygen atoms are conserved in both proteins. r <dig> of xce was also involved in the hydrogen bond with the p1’ carbonyl oxygen of the inhibitor as observed for r <dig> of ece- <dig>  hence, all hydrogen bonding interactions are also found in the xce-bound docked conformation of the inhibitor.

the specificity of all metalloproteases depends on the interactions of the p1’ and p2’ moieties of their substrates/inhibitors with the corresponding s1’ and s2’ subsites of the enzyme. we used the well characterized subsite specificity information of ece- <dig> to understand the structural difference in xce present at the subsite level. the amino acid residues i <dig>  l <dig>  i <dig>  t <dig>  i <dig>  f <dig>  n <dig> and w <dig> constitute the s1’ subsite in xce corresponding to the large pocket of ece- <dig> comprising i <dig>  f <dig>  i <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  f <dig>  v <dig> and w <dig> residues as illustrated from figures 
2c and 
2d, respectively. the p1’ group with large hydrophobic side-chains indicates the specificity of ece- <dig> due to the large hydrophobic s1’ subsite. the presence of non-conserved hydrophilic t <dig> in xce corresponding to v <dig> of ece- <dig> did not change the overall hydrophobic environment of the s1’ recognition pocket because of the formation of strong hydrogen bond with g <dig> located outside the binding pocket. replacement of v <dig> with i <dig> in xce provided more hydrophobic environment than that of ece- <dig>  thus resulting in a favorable interaction with the p1’ hydrophobic side-chain of the inhibitor. n <dig> in xce occupied more space which increases the depth and flexibility of the s1’ subsite in xce as compared to ece- <dig> with small v <dig> 

the s2’ subsites of xce and ece- <dig> contain all non-conserved amino acids except one arginine as shown in figures 
2e and 
2f, respectively. the side-chain of r <dig>  s <dig>  and w <dig> in ece- <dig> occupied more space and volume than their counterpart t <dig>  a <dig>  and g <dig> residues in xce. schulz et al. <cit>  suggested that the sidechains of the s2’ subsite residues in ece- <dig> were disordered and did not establish any hydrogen bond due to which, indole moiety of phosphoramidon was not appropriately anchored into the s2’ pocket of ece- <dig>  on the other hand, all residues of the s2’ subsite in xce are found very close, thus leading to very narrow binding pocket responsible for strong binding of phosphoramidon at this region. r <dig> of ece- <dig> formed water mediated hydrogen bonds with the terminal carboxylate of phosphoramidon, which are lacking in xce due to the non-conserved t <dig> residue. table 
 <dig> summarizes the effect of non-conserved subsite residues of both enzymes and their possible consequences on the inhibitor binding. the binding pattern of phosphoramidon and its relative stability into the active site of both proteins are further explored with the help of md simulations.

molecular dynamics simulations
molecular dynamics simulations permit characterization of biomolecular processes such as the conformational transitions associated with the functions of protein at molecular and atomic level. nowadays, this technique is being extensively used to study the conformational flexibility of biological macromolecules because of the advances in computer hardware, software, and md algorithms 
 <cit> . we calculated fluctuations in protein structure for all four systems axce, cxce, aece- <dig>  cece- <dig> by means of nanosecond timescale md simulations which are proved to be a complementary technique for experiments. modern computer architectures provide means to perform md simulations of varying time length that can range from nanoseconds to microsecond-timescale or even at millisecond timescale. however, long timescale md simulations based on all-atom force fields are still not so convincing to be employed. since most of the force fields were parameterized previously and are therefore not extensively applied in this time regime. as an illustration of the problems related to unrealistic and irreversible structural changes, the dna simulation of the timescale beyond 20– <dig> ns time could be exemplified 
 <cit> . such long timescale md simulations of biological macromolecules utilizing enhanced sampling methods and/or coarse-graining methods were frequently reported. on the other hand short timescale md simulations such as of few nanoseconds have serious concerns about dealing the process of relaxation and the proper sampling of the equilibrium dynamics. these two significant factors must be kept in mind when presenting results based on the short md run. therefore, to ensure about sufficient amount of sampling which is a hard task, the use of replicate simulations could be helpful to address this issue. in the absence of replicate simulations the situation becomes worse to test proper sampling as well as the reproducibility of the results obtained from the simulations could be challenged. could be an alternative of the replicate simulations, the use of better analysis of the equilibration process would be significant. plotting root mean square deviation  from the time-averaged structure  calculated from the simulation trajectories of all systems would also adequately answer other relevant questions about sampling time as opposed to rmsdinit.

root mean square deviation  of the protein backbone
an initial evaluation involves analysis of the protein structure via root mean square deviations  of backbone atoms with respect to the equilibrated structure  to perform sampling of trajectories and to evaluate the stability of proteins throughout the simulation time as illustrated in figure 
3a. the rmsdinit for apo xce  fluctuated between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å with an average value of  <dig>  Å whereas rmsdinit of the inhibitor bound xce  appeared from the same starting point as in axce but after  <dig> ns it exhibited a large deviation up to  <dig>  Å, which indicates changes in the protein structure due to protein-inhibitor complex formation. the template protein ece- <dig> in their apo  and complexed form  showed an increased rmsdinit value due to more flexibility compared to its homologue xce in their corresponding forms . the complex formation in ece  resulted in rmsdinit difference of ~ <dig>  Å from the average rmsdinit value calculated for its apo form . the difference in rmsdinit values for axce and cxce resembles to ece- <dig> proteins which indicates the similar conformational changes in both proteins from the binding of phosphoramidon which will be described in latter sections. figure 
3b illustrates the root mean square deviation with respect to the x-ray structure of all heavy atoms of ece- <dig> which exhibited a fluctuation between ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  Å with an average value of  <dig>  Å. the identical approach was used to analyze the structural deviation in terms of rmsd with respect to the initial homology model of xce , which varied between ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  Å, thus showing a significant structural deviation from the homologue structure. besides these two rmsd plots such as rmsdinit and rmsd with respect to x-ray structure which are considered poor metrics to observe equilibration process, the rmsdtime−averaged plots of all proteins forming v-shape could therefore be a fair substitute to observe the under-sampled simulations. the smallest rmsd values in the plots shown in figure 
3c are concentrated around the center of the simulations of  <dig> ns showing that the equilibration is in progress. u-shaped rmsdtime−averaged plots were obtained but not v-shaped that show that the equilibration is in progress along with some contaminations of relaxation processes. nevertheless, the behavior shown by the simulations having both equilibration and a small amount relaxation processes can still be regarded as providing biologically significant information. a question can also arisen that why the short md run could provide a conformation close to that of the native state of the protein as determined via x-ray structure  
 <cit> . this issue was addressed by ramachandran plots  developed for all the equilibrated structures that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. this validates the simulation approach which was used to yield the nearly native conformation of the protein as all simulations adopted the near crystal structure distributions with some variation in the secondary structure elements. the approach is therefore, applicable to analyze other properties of the given size of protein.

b-factor and secondary structure calculations
the fluctuations in the local structure of xce and ece- <dig> protein in their apo and complexed forms were further investigated employing the b-factors  calculation for αc atom of each residue. figure 
4a and 
4b depict calculated b-factors of  xce and ece- <dig>  respectively reflecting significant fluctuations in the loop regions. the calculated average b-factor of cece- <dig>  was lower than average crystallographic b-factors for αc atom  resulting from a higher degree of hydration in the simulation compared to the crystal structure. considering the information obtained from comparison between theoretical and experimental b-factors of cece- <dig> protein, the similar approach was used to calculate average b-factors of each xce amino acids. the average cxce b-factors was calculated as  <dig>  Å <dig> which is comparable to the average b-factor of cece- <dig> indicating a bit lower dynamic flexibility of cxce compared to cece- <dig>  secondary structure calculations were also performed to correlate fluctuations of residues with the corresponding changes in the secondary structure elements for axce and cxce, as shown in figures 
5a and 
5b, respectively. amino acid residues 137– <dig> of axce located in the region l <dig> comprised mostly of loops along with a turn which underwent antiparallel β sheet conformation due to complexation with the inhibitor . in axce, residues 145– <dig> were folded into β strand after a period of  <dig> ns whereas β strand of 143– <dig> residues in cxce was degraded into loops during the simulation observed via visual inspection. furthermore, amino acid residues 151– <dig> of the s2’ subsite passed from α-helix to 3– <dig> helix, which in turn affects the region l <dig> of xce because it is found at the immediate vicinity of the s2’ subsite. loop area l <dig> in cxce was more fluctuated than that of axce, which indicates conformational modifications of this region after the inhibitor binding . the region l <dig>  of both xce comprised of a loop  and an α-helix , respectively. secondary structure plots of xce proteins  suggest that the unfolding of the α-helix  results in an increased fluctuation of the region l <dig> in axce which is reduced upon binding with the inhibitor. moreover, regions l <dig>  and l <dig>  are situated at far bottom of the active site and exhibited high level of fluctuations in the secondary structure from α-helix to 3-helix/turn and from 3– <dig> helix to loop/turn, respectively . at the front of the binding site, most significant regions l <dig> , l <dig>  and l <dig>  are comprised of loops only and therefore, are expected to show high flexibility. these regions exhibited more fluctuations in cxce compared to axce indicating the direct influence of the inhibitor binding . major deviations in the secondary structure of the residues 330– <dig> of l <dig>  378– <dig> of l <dig>  and 424– <dig> of l <dig> are observed as they are folded into α-helix in axce whereas they showed random transitions from 3– <dig> helix/turns to unstructured loops in cxce . figure 
4b illustrates b-factors of each amino acid residue of apo and complexed ece- <dig> correlating the extent of structural modifications produced by the inhibitor. during simulation, the region l <dig>  including residues of the s2’ subsite experiences changes in its secondary structure elements for both forms of ece- <dig> as shown in figures 
5c and 
5d. amino acid residues 143– <dig> are present as turn in aece- <dig> whereas as parallel β-sheet in cece- <dig>  r <dig> belonging to the s2’ subsite was folded into antiparallel β-sheet at initial stage of the simulation in both forms of ece- <dig>  it is suggested that the folding of r <dig> is necessary for its strong interaction with the terminal carboxylate. the conformation adopted by amino acid residues 150– <dig> in aece- <dig> was a compact α-helix but during simulation this α-helix was transformed into a turn due to its drifting from the active site , however, it is found as a compact α-helix throughout the simulation in cece- <dig> . amino acid residues 274– <dig> close to the active site constitute a loop  which showed large fluctuations in both forms of ece- <dig>  in cece- <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig>  get stabilized after the inhibitor binding attributed by their low fluctuations in b-factors while l <dig>  and l <dig>  showed higher fluctuations compared to those of aece- <dig> . secondary structure calculations revealed conformational transformations into turns/β sheet/α-helix in the l <dig> region only whereas l <dig>  l <dig>  and l <dig> regions remain unstructured as turns/loops in both forms of ece- <dig> . thus, inhibitor binding accounts for high fluctuations of the loop regions and affects overall secondary structure elements surrounding the active site of both xce and ece- <dig> proteins.

conformational changes in the active site amino acids of xce
the conformational changes induced by the inhibitor on the active site of zinc peptidases have not been understood yet in detail due to the nonavailability of their 3d apo structures. the separate sampling of the bound and unbound states is the key to describe conformational differences upon binding. figure 
6a shows the superimposed axce structures before and averaged over  <dig> ns simulation whereas similar coordinates for cxce are displayed in figure 
6b. significant conformational changes in the side-chains of i <dig>  l <dig>  n <dig> and r <dig> are observed in both forms as a result of simulation. during simulation, the side-chain of i <dig> acquired cis conformation in cxce, being close to the p1’ leucyl moiety of the inhibitor, whereas its trans conformation is stable in axce. n <dig> rotated its side-chain towards the p2’ carbonyl oxygen in cxce during simulation. the inside bending of n <dig> is found initially in both forms of xce while its outside bending is only observed during the simulation in cxce which results in the formation of hydrogen bond . inside and outside transition of n <dig> drastically affects the hydrogen bonding interaction of l <dig> with the p2’ indole moiety of the inhibitor. all residues of the s1’ and s2’ subsites are stable in their initial position, however, w <dig> approached more close to the p1’ leucyl moiety of the inhibitor during simulation. the positively charged r <dig> in cxce acquired extended conformation and attracted towards the negatively charged carboxylate of the inhibitor as the simulation proceed. dssp calculations also revealed the folding of r <dig> into antiparallel β-sheet during simulation.

conformational changes in the active site amino acids of ece-1
figure 
7a depicts the active site residues of the superimposed aece- <dig> structures before and averaged over  <dig> ns simulation while similar coordinates for cece- <dig> are shown in figure 
7b. in cece- <dig>  the side-chain of r <dig> approached very close to the carboxylate group of the inhibitor during simulation, however, it was found far apart before simulation. dssp calculations also illustrated the folding of r <dig> into antiparallel β-sheet during simulation. side-chain nitrogen atom of n <dig> rotated towards the p1’ amidic nh group of the inhibitor in cece- <dig> during simulation causes loss of its interaction which was found in the crystal structure . before simulation, f <dig>  f <dig>  and w <dig> are perpendicularly inclined towards the p1’ leucyl moiety of the inhibitor and known to form an aromatic wall which can block its deeper approach into the s1’ pocket. during simulation, w <dig> folded into 3– <dig> helix and approached more closer to the p1’ group of the inhibitor in cece- <dig> as compared to the crystal structure. all residues of the s1’ subsite are stable in their initial position but i <dig> changes trans conformation in cece- <dig>  in aece- <dig>  remarkable conformational drift in the s2’ residues  from the active site is observed , however, in cece- <dig> this drifting is not found due to the presence of the inhibitor which can hold them towards itself. it is not identified yet that in order to fit into the interior of the enzyme whether big endothelins, the in-vivo substrates of ece- <dig>  forces an opening of the enzyme wall or requires a folded conformation of their c-terminal part 
 <cit> . hence, the conformational drift in the s2’ residues identified in our simulation study correlates well with the activity of aece- <dig> towards the large c-terminals containing natural substrates.

stability of enzyme-inhibitor interactions
both enzymes contain tetrahedral zinc ion  coordinated with h607/h <dig>  h611/h <dig>  e667/e <dig> and the po <dig> atom of phosphoramidon in ece-1/xce, respectively. table 
 <dig> summarizes the average coordinate bond distances whereas average hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions evaluated over stable period of 2– <dig> ns for the enzyme-inhibitor complexes are given in table 
 <dig>  the stability of the hydrogen bonds between the inhibitor and protein are probed by their percent occupancy. backbone hydrogen bonding residues of xce are l <dig>  n <dig>  and a <dig>  which are equivalent to v <dig>  n <dig>  and a <dig> of ece- <dig>  the p1’ amidic nitrogen, the p2’ amidic nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of phosphoramidon strongly bound to the carbonyl oxygen of a <dig>  the carbonyl oxygen and amidic nitrogen of n <dig> in xce, also attributed by their high percent occupancy, whereas the sustainability of these interactions from a <dig> and n <dig> of ece- <dig> is low . during simulation, non-conserved residues l <dig> of xce and v <dig> of ece- <dig> got changes in their backbone dihedral angles which led to the loss of their interaction with the nh group of the indole moiety of phosphoramidon. thus, it was analyzed that not even a single backbone residue of ece- <dig> maintain its vital hydrogen bonding, which is also corroborated by the inhibitory potency of phosphoramidon in μm range against ece- <dig>  an hydrogen bond from r <dig> of xce with the p1’ carbonyl oxygen showed very low occupancy compared to the corresponding bond from r <dig> of ece- <dig> which comparatively attained higher stability . i <dig> and v <dig> of ece- <dig> remained close to the p1’ group during simulation, however, equivalent residues i <dig> and i <dig> of xce were found far apart before simulation and only i <dig> established hydrophobic interaction during simulation . f <dig> of ece- <dig> formed van der waal contact and π-π stacking to the p2’ indole moiety while i <dig> of xce did not interact with the p2’ group but prefered hydrophobic interaction with the p1’ moiety due to its cis conformation . before simulation, r <dig> of ece- <dig> was involved in water mediated hydrogen bonds with the terminal carboxylate but after  <dig> ps these interactions are converted into strong salt bridge. johnson et al. determined carboxydipeptidase activity of ece- <dig> during the cleavage of bradykinin and substance p revealing that these substrates with cooh-terminal carboxylates are highly preferred over their cognate amides and esters 
 <cit> . interestingly, formation of salt bridge from r <dig> coorelate with the carboxydipeptidase activity of ece- <dig>  however, johnson et al. did not find any significant decrease in activity when measured against r133l mutant enzyme 
 <cit> . the responsibility of the terminal carboxylate binding in xce is taken by r <dig>  and in doing so, n <dig> and r <dig> of xce behave like the terminal carboxylate binding residues n <dig> and r <dig> of neutral endopeptidase  
 <cit> . during simulation, the binding mode of phosphoramidon in xce is found similar to its binding in nep and it can be speculated that phosphoramidon binds firmly with xce just like its strong binding to nep. the different binding conformation of phosphoramidon in xce and ece- <dig> strengthens our hypothesis that although xce is more close to ece- <dig> but still minor differences in the behavior of their equivalent residues of the active site and its surrounding affect their tendency towards natural substrates.

CONCLUSIONS
the great interest in members of the m <dig> family of zinc peptidases as putative therapeutic targets and the discovery of new members of this family lead us to investigate the three-dimensional structure and dynamic flexibility of xce  and enable us to compare it with already well established member ece- <dig>  homology modeling of xce and docking of phosphoramidon into the modeled structure provided the primary information about its structural similarities and differences with ece- <dig>  simulation of apo and phosphoramidon bound forms of xce and ece- <dig> revealed that the inhibitor induced distinct conformational changes surrounding the active site of both enzymes. the stability of i <dig>  i <dig> and w <dig> of xce and i <dig>  v <dig> and w <dig> of ece- <dig> suggest that these residues behave as the central determinant in the hydrophobic lock of their s1’ pockets. w714/w <dig> maintains 3– <dig> helical structure whereas r145/r <dig> and f149/t <dig> of ece-1/xce acquire antiparallel β-sheet structure for their strong binding to the inhibitor. secondary structure changes of the s2’ residues  from α-helix to turn in aece- <dig> explain the accomodation of large c-terminals of natural substrates into this region  while their compactness in helical form clarify the difference in specificity of axce at this region. the carboxydipeptidase activity of ece- <dig> is also justified by the folding of r <dig> into antiparallel β-sheet and similar role can be speculated for its structural counterpart r <dig> of xce. hence, larger variations and greater fluctuations in the s2’ subsite of both enzymes would be instrumental in determining their different substrate specificities. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study of ece- <dig> and xce in context of their comparison. the structural features of both proteins and their dynamical behavior with phosphoramidon obtained from this study provide valuable information that can be used in the rational design of specific inhibitors for ece-like proteins. however, molecular mechanism of substrate specificity in xce needs to be ascertained carefully with the help of detailed experiments in the light of our preliminary theoretical study.
