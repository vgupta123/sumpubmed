BACKGROUND
clostridium thermocellum is a gram-positive thermophilic anaerobe capable of degrading cellulose and producing ethanol and hydrogen. these qualities render c. thermocellum potentially useful for the production of biofuel from biomass. the cellulytic activities of this organism were well studied, the corresponding enzymes were found to organize into a cell surfaced bound multienzyme complex, termed cellulosome  <cit> . the arrangement of the enzymatic subunits in the cellulosome complex, made possible by a scaffoldin subunit, promotes enhanced substrate binding and degradation. however, other parts of its cellular functions are not well understood. recently, a genome scale metabolic model was constructed  <cit> , which provides a good basis for the overall understanding of its metabolism. since membrane is where many important physiological functions, such as energy generation, protein trafficking, and small molecule transport  <cit> , take place, we focused on membrane protein complexes as a start point to identify unique features of c. thermocellum. identification of protein complexes in c. thermocellum is an important step toward understanding cellular behavior at an integrative level.

blue native-page  is a charge shift method first developed by schägger and von jagow  <cit>  to separate membrane protein complexes. it has been used successfully to characterize respiratory complexes in yeast mitochondria and paracoccus denitrificans  <cit> , photosynthetic complexes in plants and synechocystis  <cit> , and cell envelope protein complexes in e. coli  <cit> . it differs from other native gel electrophoresis mainly because the electrophoretic mobility of a protein is determined by the negative charge of the bound coomassie blue dye, while separation of proteins is achieved by the molecular sieve effect provided by the polyacrylamide gradient of descending pore size similar to other page methods. bn-page, when coupled with a second dimensional sds-page and mass spectrometry offers an attractive proteomic solution for analysis of membrane protein complexes and for basic expression profiling. it can complement traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis proteomic method by providing a platform to separate membrane proteins.

in this work, we developed a bn-page protocol for the analysis of membrane protein complexes of c. thermocellum.

RESULTS
preparation of membrane protein samples
purification of protein complexes in an intact form  is largely dependent on the solubilization conditions used and can differ for various complexes. by testing four commonly used detergents at different concentrations , we were able to select a protocol using the detergent n-dodecyl-d-maltoside . this protocol detected a number of complexes in the molecular mass range from  <dig> to over  <dig>  kda. the molecular mass of protein complexes was calculated by plotting the mws of marker proteins against their migration distances.

to identify the individual proteins in each complex, the one-dimensional bn gel strips were analyzed in the second dimension by sds-page, figure  <dig>  putative complexes were consequently resolved into vertical "channels" enabling visualization of the individual constituents. proteins that had formed a complex in the bn gel were tentatively recognized by their locations on a vertical line on the sds gel, and also by their similar shapes on the sds gel .

protein identification
thirty six spots were picked from the sds gel for maldi-tof/tof identification. thirty proteins were identified in  <dig> spots , and they represent  <dig> different proteins . among them,  <dig> proteins were predicted by tmhmm  <cit>   to be membrane protein containing α-helical transmembrane segments. the rest maybe membrane-associated proteins . many atypical membrane proteins are tethered to the membranes through lipid moieties, hydrophobic patches, charge interactions or by their association with a membrane protein complexes. the identified proteins were organized into functional groups based on cog using cognitor tool available at ncbi  <cit>  and transporter related proteins were organized in membrane transporter complexes. putative protein complexes and their estimated sizes observed on the bn-page were summarized in table  <dig>  the false positive rate of protein identification was calculated by reverse database search to be lower than  <dig> %.

complexes in energy production and conversion
in prokaryotes, three evolutionarily related sub types of atpases/synthases were found, categorized as f- , v-  and a-  type atpases on the basis of their function and taxonomic origins. although eukaryotes contain both f- and v-atpases, each highly specialized in its physiological functions; archaea and eubacteria typically contain only one subtype of atpase  <cit> . most eubacteria contain f-atpases, but some eubacteria contain both f- and v-atpases, whereas all known archaea contain complexes that are evolutionarily closer to v-atpases and are referred to as a-atpases due to their archael origin.

generally, the f1-f0-atp synthase contains eight subunits arranged in two subcomplexes: f <dig>  and f <dig>   <cit> . the v1-v0-atp synthase contains nine subunits arranged in two subcomplexes: v <dig>  and v <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, in the genome of c. thermocellum, there are two atpase gene clusters: a f1-f0-atp synthase  and v1-v0-atp synthase , both with a complete set of subunits.

we detected two subunits of f1-f0-atpase, f <dig> subunit α  and f <dig> subunit β , with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda and two subunits of v1-v0-atpase, v <dig> subunit a  and v <dig> subunit b , with an estimated molecular mass of  <dig> kda. these may represent a subcomplex of α3β <dig> and a3b <dig> in f <dig> and v <dig>  respectively. we conducted a large scale search of atpase in published genomes of eubacteria from ncbi,  <dig> genomes were found to contain genes encoding f-type atpases,  <dig> genomes contain genes encoding v-type atpases, and only  <dig> genomes contain both f-type and v-type atpases . the co-presence of both atpases in a bacterium is limited to a few genera, which include several streptococcus, clostridium, anaeromyxobacter strains, two cyanothece species, an enterococcus faecalis and a nitrosococcus oceani. we deduce these may reflect unusual atp generating mechanisms in these bacteria. in this work, we found that both the f- and v-type atpases are expressed c. themocellum. co-presence of v- and f-type atpases in a bacterium is uncommon. previously, only enterococcus hirae was reported to utilize both types of atpases  <cit> . the e. hirae v-type atpase differs from typical v-type atpase in preferentially transporting na+  <cit>  instead of h+. in the thermophilic clostridium fervidus, a second example of na+-pumping v-type atpase was reported  <cit> . it is reasonable to speculate that the v-type atpase in c. thermocellum is a na+-pumping atpase. most bacteria contain either f-type or v-type atpase, among those that contain both types of atpases, new functional variants of atpases could be identified and their roles in bacterial physiology could be investigated.

bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase  was detected at over  <dig> kda. adhs could be classified into  <dig> classes based on their length: short chain adh  and medium chain adh  exist in a homotetramer form  <cit> , but a structure of long chain adh  was not reported. the aldh-adh of c. thermocellum appears to be a long chain adh and forms a homo-multimer like the adh in entamoeba histolytica  <cit> . alcohol dehydrogenases were reported to be membrane-bound protein complexes  <cit> , it is reasonable to observe adh in c. thermocellum membrane fraction.

complexes in lipid transport and metabolism
carboxyl transferase  was identified at ~ <dig> kda. in eubacteria, ct is part of acetyl coenzyme a carboxylase  complex, which normally consists of biotin carboxylase , biotin carboxyl carrier protein , and ct. typically, ct contains two subunits in a stable α2β <dig> form  <cit> . but, in streptomyces coelicolor, the acc enzyme has a subunit  with fused bc and bccp domains, and another subunit  that contains the fused ct domains  <cit> . in archaea, acc is a multi-subunit enzyme, with bc, bccp and ct subunits. the archael ct subunit is also a single protein  in a ct <dig> form, rather than two separate subunits, which is similar to the β subunit  of the acc from streptomyces  <cit> . in c. thermocellum, ct is a  <dig> kda protein, which contains two domains of carboxyl transferase, and we did not detect other acc subunits on bn/sds-page. so the ct appears to be a sub complex of ct <dig> not associated with bc and bccp. ct was also detected at over  <dig> kda, which maybe due to precipitation during electrophoresis or ct formed a large complex with other subunits of acc. previous studies also suggested acc may form a membrane-associated protein complex  <cit> .

complexes in amino acid transport and metabolism
serine-acetyl-transferase , a subunit of cysteine synthase , was detected at ~ <dig> kda corresponding to the size of intact cs complex. typical cs complex is composed of one sat and two o-acetyl-serine--lyases   <cit> , but we did not detect oas-tl. it is likely that oas-tl was masked by the very abundant protein, cthe_ <dig>  detection of cs in the membrane fractions has been reported in other studies  <cit> .

ornithine carbamoyltransferase  was identified at ~ <dig> kda, probably in a typical homo-trimer form  <cit> . some studies suggest that otcase is a cell surface protein  <cit>  whereas shi et al.  <cit>  reported that otcase maybe a membrane-associated protein based on sequence analyses. our results support the membrane location of otcase.

atp-dependent metalloprotease ftsh  was detected at over  <dig> kda. ftsh is a cytoplasmic membrane-integrated protein that functions to processively degrade both cytoplasmic and membrane proteins in concert with protein unfolding and is known to form a large membrane-spanning holoenzyme of more than  <dig> kda with the prohibitin-like proteins hflk and hflc  <cit>  or in a hexameric ring structure  <cit> . although hflk and hflc homologues were not detected from the gel, our results indicate that ftsh forms a large complex on the membrane.

complexes in translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis
polyribonucleotide phosphorylase  was identified at ~ <dig> kda in the gel at a size of a dimer. it was reported to form a homo-trimer in eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea  <cit>  and was found in membrane fractions  <cit> .

complexes in inorganic ion transport and metabolism
we detected ferritin  at ~ <dig> kda, indicating that it is intact in a typical  <dig> mer form on bn-page  <cit> . but ferritin was also detected at over  <dig> kda on sds-page, maybe due to incomplete denaturation. ferritin is a well known membrane-bound protein.

membrane transport complexes
three solute binding proteins , two atp binding cassette proteins , one integral membrane component , and an abc transporter  with fused abc and im domains were identified from the sds gel.

abc transporter diverged into three main classes: class  <dig> is comprised of fused abc and im domains; class  <dig> is comprised of two tandem repeated abc domains with no im domains, this class likely does not function as transporters; class  <dig> contains independent im and abc domains, that correspond to most bp-dependent importers <cit> . a typical class  <dig> abc transporter complex consists of one bp, two abcs and two ims, but the interactions of bp with the complex are weak, so most often only abc and im were isolated in a transporter complex  <cit> . in gram-positive bacteria, bp is either tethered to the cell surface via an n-terminal cys residue covalently attached to the lipid membrane or by interaction with the im component of a transporter complex  <cit> .

an abc transporter  was detected at ~ <dig> kda, it is a class  <dig> abc transporter with fused abc and im domains. the estimated size of cthe_ <dig> indicates that it was isolated in an intact dimeric form.

the solute binding protein , the integral membrane protein  and the atp binding cassette protein  were identified on a vertical line at ~ <dig> kda. in the genome of c. thermocellum, no atp binding cassette proteins are found near cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig>  and cthe_ <dig> is not adjacent to other bp or im proteins. the identification of these proteins on a vertical line strongly suggests that they form a transporter complex. cthe_ <dig> is an abundantly expressed protein under our culture condition, it was detected at ~ <dig> kda to over  <dig> kda, and the high molecular weight spots maybe result of protein precipitation during electrophoresis.

cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig> form an abc transporter gene cluster in the genome. the atp binding cassette protein  was detected at an estimated molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda. but the integral membrane protein cthe_ <dig>  and solute binding protein cthe_ <dig>  were not detected. the estimated size of this abc transporter complex suggests it contains two subunits of cthe_ <dig>  two subunits cthe_ <dig> and one subunit of cthe_ <dig> as an intact complex. cthe_ <dig> was detected at ~ <dig> kda on a horizontal line with cthe_ <dig>  which could be due to dissociation of the transporter complex during electrophoresis.

cthe_ <dig>  cthe_ <dig> and cthe_ <dig> form an abc transporter gene cluster in the genome. the solute binding protein  was detected at ~ <dig> kda. but the integral membrane protein cthe_ <dig>  and atp binding cassette protein cthe_ <dig>  was not detected. the size of abc transporter complex estimated by bn-page, suggests it contains two subunits cthe_ <dig>  two subunits cthe_ <dig> and one subunit of cthe_ <dig> 

in this study, we did not detect the proteins in other abc transporter gene clusters studied in vitro by nataf  <cit>  except cthe_ <dig> 

other protein complexes
in gram-positive bacteria, s-layer proteins are known to non-covalently attach to the pyruvylated negatively-charged secondary cell wall polymers  by the surface layer homology  domains  <cit> . we detected s-layer protein  at ~ <dig> kda, probably in a monomeric form, and there maybe a fragment of scwp tethered with s-layer protein.

prepilin  was identified from  <dig> kda to  <dig> kda in the sds gel, this may reflect that the prepilins were in a process of pilin assembly  <cit> .

hypothetical proteins
three hypothetical proteins  were detected in our membrane sample. although cthe_ <dig> showed weak similarity to domains designated prk  <dig>  pfam  <dig> and cog <dig>  the functions of these domains or their corresponding proteins are not known.

discussions on the method
previously, a bicine-dsds-page method was developed to separate membrane proteins  <cit> , it employs strong solubilization conditions in both dimensions of sds-page. the method is suitable for membrane proteomics study, and was used to identify  <dig> membrane proteins from c. thermocellum  <cit> . in this work, bn/sds-page was applied in the analysis of membrane protein complexes of c. thermocellum for the first time. although the first dimensional bn-page was carefully optimized, the second dimensional sds-page proved difficult to perform probably because the solubilization factors were altered during sds electrophoresis. so technically, it is still a huge challenge to isolate and solubilize membrane protein complexes as well as to separate these complexes on bn/sds-page. to isolate intact protein complexes, gentle cell disruption method must be considered. we used sonication conditions , that sufficiently protected complex stability. after repeat optimization of various conditions, we were able to solubilize and separate a sub-fraction of membrane protein complexes and to identify  <dig> membranes proteins representing  <dig> intact or sub protein complexes. most of the proteins identified were previously reported to be membrane proteins, thus validating our sample preparation protocol. many protein complexes we reported were identified for the first time in c. thermocellum, thus our findings and protocol paved the way for future detailed characterization of these complexes. bn/sds-page is a suitable approach for large scale protein-protein interaction investigation, and it is probably the only method of choice to analyze membrane protein complexes on proteomic scale. this method allowed us to detect the simultaneous expression of two sets of atp synthases  in c. thermocellum, and this finding provides strong bases for the future investigation into the distinct roles of these atpases in this bacterium.

CONCLUSIONS
two dimensional blue native/sds-page was used to detect membrane protein complexes in c. thermocellum and revealed the simultaneous expression of two sets of atp synthases. the protocol developed in this work paves the way for further functional characterization of membrane protein complexes in this bacterium.
