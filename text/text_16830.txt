BACKGROUND
acupuncture is a component of traditional chinese medicine  most often characterized by stimulation of specific body sites with sharp 'insertive' needles. however, blunt 'non-insertive' needles  may also be used to apply rapid percussive pressure, specifically tapping, without penetrating the skin, akin to 'acupressure'. modern insertive acupuncture frequently involves electrical stimulation applied directly to inserted needles . in a typical clinical acupuncture session, a patient may be stimulated manually or electrically at one or more body sites for >  <dig> minutes. during this time the patient is often left alone to 'relax' without additional sensory stimuli and there is no requirement for focused attention. recently, acupuncture has been gaining popularity in the west as a complementary therapy and much research is aimed at elucidating its neural correlates.

currently, fmri data show that insertive acupuncture activates subcortical brain areas which are implicated in endogenous anti-nociception . numerous animal studies show that acupuncture analgesia is mediated by opiodergic and/or monoaminergic neurotransmission involving the brainstem, thalamus and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis  <cit> . this has also been evidenced in humans using pet  <cit> . in the case of painful needling, afferent spinal gating and diffuse noxious inhibitory control  may provide short-term analgesia  <cit> .

however, these are not the only ways acupuncture may exert effects on the body. interestingly, even though fmri investigations have found greater subcortical responses for insertive acupuncture vs. non-insertive acupressure-like tapping they have shown stronger s <dig> response to the latter  <cit> . recent neuroimaging data also suggest that the regular afferent stimulation provided by acupuncture may affect neuroplasticity in s <dig> cortex  <cit> . thus, further investigation of the cortical signatures for electroacupuncture  as well as acupressure stimulation would be useful. since s <dig> neural activity occurs on a millisecond timescale, magnetoencephalography  may be used to non-invasively study these cortical responses.

in the present study, we used meg to spatiotemporally map somatosensory cortical response to different types of acupuncture, electroacupuncture  and acupressure . forearm acupoints were chosen based on ease of access and because meg is biased towards superficial brain activity  <cit>  making them easier to localize than leg acupoints. importantly, we sought to mimic clinical acupuncture intervention procedures as much as possible. to do this we intentionally lacked control for attention and did not utilize concurrent sensory  stimuli. furthermore, both ea and ap were given with clinically relevant parameters, i.e.  <dig> hz stimulus rate and >  <dig> min. duration. finally, since acupoint specificity remains debatable  <cit>  and may be exemplified predominantly as differences in somatotopic localization, we tested ea and ap at the same forearm acupoints.

RESULTS
in the present study  <dig> healthy, right handed, subjects were given ea and non-invasive ap each at a low frequency  for  <dig> minutes while meg was recorded.

si sources and evoked timecourse modulation
for both ea and ap, the primary sources of meg activity in each subject, localized to the contralateral primary somatosensory  cortex, roughly area 3b . ea/ap sources neighbored one another with ap sources mapping slightly dorsal to ea in most subjects. the average response for  <dig> minutes of ea stimulation  first peaked at  <dig>  ms post-stimulus and then at  <dig>  ms . the spatiotemporal characteristics of these responses were similar to the m <dig> and m <dig> components evoked by median nerve stimulation  <cit> . for ap, initial peaks  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms shown  were similar in orientation but delayed compared to ea. both conditions also demonstrated peaks at ~ <dig> ms and ~ <dig> ms, with those for ap again slightly delayed. wide, long-latency, peaks occurred for both stimuli; at  <dig>  ms for ea and  <dig>  ms for ap. to determine if/how evoked si responses were modulated during both  <dig> minute runs of ea and ap stimulation, individual data were divided into three,  <dig> minute sub-averages . these sub-averages showed attenuation of peak-to-peak amplitude for progressively later trials. significant decreases in peak amplitude  following  <dig> minutes of stimulation  paired t-tests, df, p <  <dig> ) were found for ea at  <dig> and  <dig> ms and for ap at  <dig> and  <dig> ms.

oscillatory responses during ea and ap stimulation
time frequency response  analysis demonstrated early and late modulation of oscillatory activity in s <dig> . early response included low gamma  ers from ~20- <dig> ms post-stimulus and theta  ers at ~50- <dig> ms. this was followed by a prolonged decrease in mu frequency power, centered at alpha  and beta  at ~100- <dig> ms post-stimulus. no significant differences were found between ea and ap in any of these ranges .

to determine how/if oscillatory response changed over time, ea and ap data were segmented into fifteen separate averages, each  <dig> minute in length. the relative power between 100- <dig> ms post-stimulus for each minute and frequency band was assessed. interestingly, over the course of ea the magnitude of beta erd appeared to decrease . a regression and goodness of fit test was performed, demonstrating a linear trend for ea . however for ap, no significant linear trend was found . these same calculations were performed for the alpha, theta and gamma band  but no trends at the same significance level were seen. however, when comparing only the first and last minute, there appears to be some decrease in beta erd for ap also , p <  <dig> ). this reduction appears qualitatively as rapid reduction in induced response during the first 3- <dig> minutes of stimulation with no significant trend during later minutes. for ea, this same comparison was just under significance , p <  <dig> ).

discussion
in the present experiment we sought to spatiotemporally map somatosensory response to different types of acupuncture, ea and ap.

basic response to ea and ap
ea and ap responses most consistently mapped to contralateral si . however, ap produced a smaller/broader m <dig> and slightly delayed m <dig> like responses . thus, with ea, underlying skin receptors/afferents were recruited simultaneously, while gradual skin indentation during ap likely produced temporal dispersion of afferent sensory signals. eeg studies have found that early seps   <cit>  and sefs  <cit>  to mechanical stimulation are often delayed and less pronounced than those from electrical stimulation. furthermore, ap evoked stronger brain response than ea, particularly at long latencies . this may be explained by differences in the number and/or type of somatosensory fibers recruited. although, both stimuli were carried at least in part by fast aÎ² sensory fibers, it is possible that the relatively larger surface area of the blunt acupressure needle tip activated more superficial sensory fibers than did ea. differences in the magnitude of brain response to acupuncture vs. non-invasive control stimulation have also been noted in fmri studies  <cit> .

time frequency response for ea  demonstrated early onset ers at ~20- <dig> ms in the gamma range . previous work utilizing visual tasks suggests that early gamma activity may reflect "stimulus selection" or local "binding" of attributes related to initial stimulus perception  <cit> . similarly, the early latency of gamma activity in this study, suggests it may support stimulus selection in si cortex. theta erd which began early  but continued into longer latencies  may support general aspects of stimulus prediction  <cit> . prolonged mu erd ~100- <dig> ms, as in other tactile meg studies, is consistent with the presence of afferent somatosensory input  <cit> . to understand if/how brain activity is modulated during the course of acupuncture and acupressure we assessed changes in the ea and ap response over the course of  <dig> minutes.

changes si activity during ea and ap
cortical activity is thought to be in a constant state of use dependant fluctuation which may exist with or without higher order processes such as attention  <cit> . in our experiment, brain activity to ea and ap changed over many minutes, indicating habituation or conditioning of response.. although, the first cortical response  maintained a consistent amplitude, evoked responses at >  <dig> ms post-stimulus were significantly attenuated after  <dig> minutes of ea . this was accompanied by a gradual decrease in beta erd at ~100- <dig> ms post-stimulus  but not in the theta, alpha or gamma frequency bands . suggesting that in the domain of sensory conditioning, local beta band activity may be most important.

furthermore, the earliest s <dig> evoked response  represents bottom-up signals propagating from layer  <dig>  to layers 2/ <dig> in cortex  <cit> . the post-stimulus latency of repetition induced decreases  suggests they may be linked to top-down cortical mechanisms including decreased attention  <cit> . it should be noted that, in the present experiment we aimed to mimic a clinical acupuncture setting by maintaining continuous  acupoint stimulation and not actively engaging subjects in a concurrent distractor task. similarly, mu erd is also attenuated when subjects are less attentive to stimulus events  <cit> . here, repetition induced decreases similar to those seen in somatosensory attentional paradigms likely reflects stimulus recognition and possibly, modification of somatosensory memories.

recent data suggest acupuncture stimulation may induce beneficial cortical plasticity  <cit>  in neuropathic states. for example, following five-weeks of acupuncture treatment on the affected arm, carpal tunnel syndrome patients demonstrated clinical improvement  and less s <dig> fmri hyperactivation compared with pretreatment baseline  <cit> . specifically it is hypothesized that the regular afferent input provided by acupuncture acts as a conditioning stimulus to counteract local symptoms of spontaneous activity occurring with parasthesias. it is well known that peripheral nerve lesions induce cortical reorganization  <cit>  which may correlate with symptoms of hyperalgesia and pain  <cit> . however, such maladaptive plasticity may be reduced  with therapy involving sensorimotor and/or visual feedback  <cit> . however, even in the absence of injury, somatosensory conditioning in the form of electrotherapy may help counteract normal age related sensorimotor decline  <cit> .

in the electrophysiological domain, somatosensory conditioning may be marked not only by decreased erf response but by changes in s <dig> beta activity over time. however, this is highly speculative and data from clinical populations is required. although exposure related changes are also seen for ap the timing of evoked responses and the lack of change in the spectral domain suggests that a more regulated and sharper stimulus  compared to a temporally diffuse mechanical stimulus . thus, although both may prove useful somatosensory conditioning stimuli, it is possible that ea may prove to be a better conditioning stimulus for neuropathic conditions where maladaptive central plasticity may be maintained by diffuse unregulated  afference - i.e. paresthesias in cts. however, this is again speculative and requires testing in clinical populations.

CONCLUSIONS
we used meg to map somatosensory brain response during  <dig> minutes of electroacupuncture and acupressure. erf's to ea and ap most consistently localized to contralateral si. however, ap differed in its temporal dynamics showing delayed response peaks, consistent with mechanical stimulation. both ea and ap demonstrated significantly decreased response amplitudes, following five minutes of stimulation. however, the latency of these decreases occurred much earlier in ea  than ap . time-frequency responses demonstrated early onset, event related synchronization , within the gamma band at ~70- <dig> ms and the theta band at ~50- <dig> ms post-stimulus. a prolonged event related desynchronization  of alpha and beta power occurred at ~100- <dig> ms post-stimulus. there was decreased beta erd at ~100- <dig> ms over the course of ea, but not with ap. the precise timing provided by ea stimulation supports its role as a conditioning stimulus which may be used to affect maladaptive neuroplasticity.
