BACKGROUND
though campylobacter spp., especially c. jejuni, have been recognized as the most frequent cause of bacterial enteric infection in many countries  <cit> , there is a great deal yet to learn about the ecology and pathogenesis of these organisms. several campylobacter genomes have now been fully or partially sequenced  <cit>  and a number of microarray experiments have explored the genetic variability within the genus  <cit> . however, to identify novel genes within campylobacter isolates of interest it will be necessary to either sequence more genomes or explore the roles of mobile genetic elements such as transposons, plasmids, and bacteriophages.

lysogenic, or temperate, bacteriophages were first recovered from campylobacter fetus  in  <dig> after induction with mitomycin c, induction in aging cultures, or induction using co-cultivation methods  <cit> . transduction of streptomycin resistance by phage induced with uv light was demonstrated shortly thereafter  <cit> , indicating that campylobacter temperate bacteriophages are capable of horizontal dna transfer. using co-cultivation techniques, bryner and colleagues  <cit>  induced, isolated, and characterized temperate bacteriophages from  <dig> of  <dig> strains of vibrio fetus . four groups of bacteriophage from lysogenic strains were defined on the basis of differential lysis of a panel of test isolates  <cit> , suggesting considerable heterogeneity in the temperate phage population. early investigations into the role of c. jejuni in enteric disease of children demonstrated the presence of temperate bacteriophages that mediated resistance to typing phages and were capable of lysing a stock strain of c. jejuni  <cit> . these phages caused spontaneous plaque formation of the host bacterium. spontaneous release of temperate bacteriophage was found to have a role in autoagglutination of campylobacter isolates  <cit> .

autoagglutinated bacteria appeared to be "leaky", and phage tail-sheaths were associated with bacterial cells.

after this initial work there was a period in which temperate or lysogenic bacteriophages were not demonstrated in campylobacter spp. several investigators attempted unsuccessfully to isolate and propagate temperate bacteriophages from c. jejuni  <cit> . however, dna sequences homologous to mu and other bacteriophages were detected in the genome of c. hyoilei  <cit> . the very recent demonstration of three distinct bacteriophage integrated into the genome of chicken isolate rm  <dig> suggests that such prophages may be common and important for the biology of c. jejuni  <cit> . at least one of these three campylobacter jejuni integrated elements   <cit>  is a mu-like phage inducible with mitomycin c designated either cjie  <dig> or campylobacter mu-like phage  <dig> . elements similar to these cjies were found quite frequently when a large panel of isolates was tested using a dna microarray, and cmlp  <dig> appeared to integrate essentially randomly in the genome  <cit> . results from southern blotting using cmlp 1-homolog genes as probes also showed that this phage appears to be capable of loss and insertion or re-insertion into different parts of the c. jejuni genome, producing changes in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  patterns  <cit> . genome rearrangements in c. jejuni were found to result from inter-genomic inversions between mu-like prophages; activation of dormant mu-like prophages subsequent to predation by virulent bacteriophage was also noted  <cit> . it appears that the prophages of at least some isolates were therefore functional and capable of lytic growth.

at the time this study was begun, there were no data available on the distribution or variability within c. jejuni of prophages homologous to cjie  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of rm  <dig>  one of the questions we wanted to answer was whether these campylobacter mu-like prophages were similar in their heterogeneity to lambdoid prophages found, for instance, in many of the enterobacteraceae. in this study we have therefore investigated the sequence diversity in approximately  <dig> –  <dig> kb regions of twelve bacteriophages homologous to cmlp  <dig> of c. jejuni strain rm  <dig>  sequence variability due to apparent insertions and deletions was detected, and results supported the concept that these bacteriophages are modular in nature, with mosaic genomes. there was no evidence for the presence of lambdoid prophages similar to those found in the enterobacteriaceae.

RESULTS
distribution of campylobacter cjie orfs
orfs for the three cjies were distributed differentially through the campylobacter population tested . cmlp  <dig> homologs were detected for all genes tested in  <dig> isolates, and the corresponding prophages were presumed to be intact, though not necessarily functional. southern blots of  <dig> isolates showed no cmlp  <dig> gene probe hybridization, suggesting the prophages were completely absent. one to six of the cmlp  <dig> genes tested were missing in the remaining  <dig> isolates; some of these may be mosaic prophages while others, especially those with hybridization to only one or two probes, could be homologous genes from a source other than a cmlp 1-like prophage.

nd = not determined; nt = not typeable; na = results not available

there did not appear to be a strong association of cmlp  <dig> carriage with the source, the hs serotype, or the phylogenetic background of the isolate. cjie  <dig> was found somewhat less frequently, as it was detected in 14/ <dig> isolates. one of the two cjie  <dig> genes tested, cje <dig>  was also found in  <dig> isolates; however, the second orf  was detected in only  <dig> isolates. no sequences with homology to λ phage were found in any of the isolates tested in southern blotting experiments.

all cmlp  <dig> gene homologs used for southern blot experiments were found in two isolates from bovine stools, but were completely absent from other bovine isolates. the single isolate from a chicken that carried a cmlp  <dig> homolog was either missing some of the genes found in the rm  <dig> prophage or had genes that were divergent in at least two regions of its sequence. both ovine isolates did not appear to carry the phage, though one had a single phage gene homolog.

sequence analysis of cmlp  <dig> homologs
on the basis of the results of the southern blot experiments described above,  <dig> isolates were chosen for sequence analysis of putative prophages homologous to cmlp  <dig>  our intent was to determine whether there was any sequence variability among these prophages and characterize the nature and extent of the changes present. if warranted, a subset of the prophages would then be completely sequenced at a later date. since virulence genes are often inserted among the late genes of bacteriophage λ  <cit> , we decided to sequence the region of the prophage containing genes for the prophage tail components, tail tape measure protein and virion morphogenesis protein.

approximately  <dig> –  <dig> kb  of each prophage, equivalent to a region from about cje <dig> to cje <dig> of the rm  <dig> genome, was sequenced by pcr amplification of approximately  <dig> –  <dig> kb fragments of the integrated phage genomes followed by chromosomal walking to fill in the complete sequence. in the case of isolate nc  <dig> an amplicon was not obtained for the region adjacent to the cje <dig> homolog, so that the sequenced region is shorter than those of the other cmlp  <dig> homologs. different primer sets were used to obtain pcr amplicons from this region for the two main groups of isolates. primer sets phs <dig> and phs <dig> proved capable of amplifying dna from the group containing nc  <dig>  nc  <dig>  and other isolates, while the pcc <dig> primer set was used to amplify product from members of the group containing the walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates. the % g+c of the sequenced regions of the  <dig> prophages and the homologous region of rm  <dig> cmlp  <dig> ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> .

the phylogenetic relationships among the cmlp  <dig> homologs are shown in figure  <dig>  the figure shows the relationships of the untrimmed sequences of all  <dig> prophages; a figure using all sequences  trimmed to the same length was indistinguishable except for the lack of nc  <dig> . three separate groupings were detected. one group contained the sequences of cmlp  <dig> homologs from the three walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig>  which were indistinguishable over the entire length of the sequence tested. one of the mlst reference isolates, nc  <dig>  was also included in this group, as was isolate 00– <dig>  these latter two isolates had quite different sts, flaa svr sequence types, and hs serotypes from the other isolates in this group. a second group of related prophage sequences included all other isolates except nc  <dig>  which constituted a group of its own.

the major structural features of the cmlp  <dig> homologs from all  <dig> isolates are compared with cmlp  <dig> in figure  <dig>  isolate nc  <dig> showed the strongest homology with cmlp  <dig> over its entire length. all other isolates had a  <dig> nucleotide region of divergent sequence in homologs to cje <dig>  which encodes the phage tail fiber protein h. the % g+c of the  <dig> bp insert was  <dig> , much higher than the % g+c of the sequenced part of these prophages or of the campylobacter chromosome as a whole. isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig> had identical sequences in this insert. other isolates had slightly less identity for this  <dig> bp insert: 98% in 00– <dig>  nc  <dig>  and nc 13266; 97% identity in 99– <dig>  00– <dig>  and nc13255; and 96% identity in isolates 00– <dig> and 00– <dig>  there were no other sequences closely related to this insert sequence found in blast  searches of the nr/nt database. the next most closely related oligonucleotide was a  <dig> bp sequence from the mus musculis chromosome  that had 88% identity with the campylobacter sequence.

the group of sequences that included the three walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates had a common  <dig> nucleotide region of divergent sequence within cje <dig> . the % g+c of the insertion in isolate 00– <dig> was  <dig> , higher than the  <dig>  % g+c of the entire sequenced part of this putative prophage. this insertion had an identical sequence over its entire length in isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and nc  <dig>  and was 99% identical over its entire length with isolate 00– <dig>  these isolates were the only ones that had such a high degree of homology in blast  searches of the nr/nt database; the next most closely related sequence was a  <dig> nt fragment from a  <dig> bp phage-related tail gene of a wolbachia endosymbiont of drosophila melanogaster .

isolate nc  <dig> had a different region of divergent sequence  with a % g+c of  <dig>  that incorporated one end of cje <dig> and adjacent genes. while the first  <dig> bp of this showed moderate homology with the homologous region in the other prophages, including rm  <dig>  the final  <dig> bp had no homology to any sequences in the nr/nt database and had a  <dig> % g+c. finally, all sequences in the group containing walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates, plus nc  <dig>  had a common divergent sequence of  <dig> nucleotides after the orf homologous to cje <dig>  this short sequence had no homology to the consensus sequence of the other strains and only low homology to any other sequences in the nr/nt database.

insertions of different sizes and at different locations were detected in nc  <dig> , in nc <dig> , and 00– <dig> . deletions were also found. a common deletion of  <dig> nucleotides was found in cmlp  <dig> homologs from 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  nc  <dig> and nc  <dig>  isolate 00– <dig> had a  <dig> nucleotide deletion within cje <dig> and nc  <dig> had an  <dig> nucleotide deletion near cje <dig>  in addition to the  <dig> nucleotide deletion described above, the cmlp  <dig> homolog of isolate nc  <dig> had a  <dig> nucleotide deletion at the end of cje <dig>  it should be noted that, in addition to the insertions and deletions, all cmlp  <dig> homolog sequences contained single nucleotide changes not apparent on the schematic diagram shown in figure  <dig> 

consistent with these major structural features, split decomposition analysis of the  <dig> partial prophage genomes exhibited a reticulate structure suggestive of extensive recombination among this population .

presence of promoter elements upstream of open reading frames  homologous to orfs from isolate rm 1221
cmlp  <dig> from rm  <dig> appeared to produce functional lytic phage particles  <cit>  suggesting that the genes required for both the lysogenic and lytic life cycle were functional. however, we were unable to successfully induce and propagate any of the putative prophages in our isolates; these prophages may or may not be functional, and may represent remnant phage dna present in the bacterial chromosome. since there appeared to be a fair bit of dna sequence diversity within our cmlp  <dig> homologs, we were interested in determining whether the predicted orfs within the partial sequences of these prophage homologs included known campylobacter promoter elements.

most of the orfs encoding genes with putative bacteriophage functions were preceded by the consensus ribosome binding sequence  for c. jejuni  <cit>  in all isolates. prophage orfs with this sequence at the appropriate position in the promoter included cje <dig>  cje <dig> , cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  and cje <dig> 

for the orfs encoding the putative cje <dig> homolog the situation was a little more complicated. in isolates 99– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  nc  <dig>  and nc  <dig> this orf had four possible alternative start sites with the start codons ttg , gtg , and atg . only the gtg and latter atg start codons were preceded by the consensus ribosome binding sequence. in the cje <dig> homolog of isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  nc <dig>  and nc  <dig> there were two predicted start sites; the first producing a peptide beginning with "mark..." and the second producing the rm 1221-like peptide beginning with "mknnt...". both start sites were preceded by appropriate ribosome binding sequences, though their placement relative to the start codon differed.

for some other orfs the consensus ribosome binding sequence was not present adjacent to the putative start codon, and possible ribosome binding sites containing a suitable combination of "a"s and "g"s – preferably containing a gg dinucleotide – were sought. the cje <dig> homolog in each putative prophage was preceded by a sequence consisting of gggagag, while each cje <dig> homolog was preceded by gggca, cje <dig> by agagg, cje <dig> by aaaggg in all isolates except nc  <dig>  and cje <dig> by atgga. only the promoter regions of cje <dig> homologs were devoid of a sequence resembling the consensus ribosome binding site or one of the potential ribosome binding sites proposed here.

the - <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> regions of campylobacter promoters are quite heterogeneous in both sequence and placement  <cit> . for this reason, only sequences identical to one of these  <dig> experimentally determined - <dig> sequences were sought within  <dig> nucleotides of the  start codon. cje <dig> homologs in all isolates were preceded by the c. jejuni sodb - <dig> sequence, taatatt. a 2a <dig>  proa-like - <dig> sequence was found preceding cje <dig>  cje <dig>  and only the atg start codon encoding the "mknnt..." start site of cje <dig>  the other two potential start sites for this orf were not preceded by any of the known - <dig> promoter sequences.

cje <dig> from all isolates except nc  <dig> carried the orf1-like - <dig> promoter sequence, tatcttt. isolate nc  <dig> had three different - <dig> sequences in its promoter region; these were identical to the sequences determined for sodb , iles , and glya . all cje <dig> orfs were preceded by the lyss - <dig> oligonucleotide , while cje <dig> was preceded by the 23es-like sequence  and cje <dig> by the 1g9-like sequence . a large proportion of the orfs identified may therefore be expressed though, once again, there is no evidence yet that these putative prophages are capable of being induced. orfs corresponding to cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  and cje <dig> did not have any of the experimentally determined - <dig> promoter sequences upstream of the start codon. it is possible that many of these orfs carry alternative - <dig> sequences.

variability of protein sequences and evidence for a modular structure of cmlp  <dig> homologs
translations were obtained using dna sequences for each orf corresponding to a cmlp  <dig> gene, and the resulting peptides were compared. results of phylogenetic analysis of these proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  translation products from cmlp  <dig> in isolate rm  <dig> were included in the analysis, as were proteins from isolates  <dig>  and cf93- <dig> that were identified in blast searches using the translated peptides from each cmlp  <dig> homolog, in each of the  <dig> isolates, as query sequences.

most of the available prophage sequence was occupied with open reading frames corresponding to the cmlp  <dig> genes identified previously  <cit> . as noted in the previous section many, but not all, of the proteins homologous to those from cmlp  <dig> had readily identified consensus ribosome binding sequences  <cit> ; fewer had clearly identifiable - <dig> consensus sequences. full-length proteins were present in all cases but one , indicating that there were no major errors in sequencing that resulted in abnormally truncated proteins. it should be noted that, because of the lack of variation in dna sequences, the protein sequences of cmlp  <dig> homologs from isolates 00– <dig> and 00– <dig> are represented here by the sequence from 00– <dig>  to which they were identical.

differences noted in the dna sequence were apparent as differences in the translated protein products. the largest possible open reading frame present in cje <dig> of isolate 00– <dig> was  <dig> amino acids longer at the n-terminus than any of the cje <dig> proteins from other isolates.

interesting variations were found in cje <dig>  which produces a protein with homology to a dna adenine methylase. the dna insertion within this gene in nc  <dig> produced a region of peptide homology with cje <dig> of strain  <dig> , which was quite different from all other cje <dig> peptides. only a partial protein sequence was obtained for the cje <dig> homolog in nc  <dig>  the 120-nucleotide deletion within cje <dig> of 00– <dig> resulted in an in-frame deletion within the c-terminal third of the protein. four possible start sites were evident in cje <dig> proteins from isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  nc  <dig>  and nc  <dig>  especially when the alternative start codons , known to be functional in both c. jejuni and in mu phages  <cit> , were used. the first site would produce proteins beginning with a leucine, while the second would produce proteins beginning at the same site as in strain cf93- <dig>  but beginning with a valine. the third putative start site would produce proteins beginning with a methionine  that were  <dig> amino acids shorter than the first site, while the fourth start site would result in proteins beginning with a methionine at the same start site as cje <dig> in rm  <dig>  an additional  <dig> amino acids shorter than proteins beginning at the second putative start site. isolates other than those noted above had only the third and fourth putative start sites. it is not clear whether all these putative start sites are actually functional, but they do suggest the potential for additional variability based on fine sequence variation.

variability was also evident in the protein sequences of cje <dig>  which was homologous to phage tail tape measure proteins. the c-terminal third of the protein was highly conserved in all sequences. in isolate nc  <dig> the remaining sequence was very similar to that of strain  <dig>  , consistent with the dna sequence divergence noted previously and shown in figure  <dig>  the dna sequence divergence identified in the group of isolates related to the walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates was apparent as a region of  <dig> amino acids that was conserved among these isolates and different from proteins in other strains. interestingly, this  <dig> amino acid region had frequent, regular, periodic stretches of sequence identity with all the other proteins, perhaps necessary to maintain the overall structure and conserve the function of the protein.

most peptide sequences of cje <dig> were very similar, except that isolates 00– <dig> , 00– <dig>  nc  <dig>  and strain rm  <dig> replaced the consensus c terminal peptide of kykkm with ntkvkk. interestingly, the  <dig> nucleotide insertion into cje <dig> of nc  <dig> translated into a c-terminal peptide extension of qkiqkiqkiqkiqkiqkm, a change one might expect would have some effect on protein function. cje <dig> of nc  <dig> also had a c-terminal extension different from all the other proteins, which were quite conserved overall. the cje <dig> peptide sequence was conserved except for the  <dig> amino acid deletion in nc  <dig> corresponding to the  <dig> nucleotide in-frame deletion in the dna of this isolate. the c-terminal third of cje <dig> from rm  <dig> and nc  <dig> was different from the corresponding protein in all other isolates, which were very similar.

homologs of proteins cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  cje <dig>  and cje <dig> were remarkably well conserved overall, suggesting that the complete peptide sequence was required for the proper function of at least some of these proteins.

phylogenetic comparisons for each protein  suggest that the cmlp 1-homologous prophages are mosaics of proteins/genes from different sources. further evidence for the modularity of the cmlp  <dig> orf homologs characterized in this study was demonstrated by performing blastp searches with each protein from each cmlp  <dig> homolog. the closest match was determined by the smallest e value. the phages appear to be mosaics, with different putative proteins similar to those from rm  <dig>  strain 93- <dig>  and strain  <dig>  .

it should be noted that a number of additional potential orfs producing translation products between  <dig>  and  <dig>  daltons were detected, especially when alternative start codons were included in the analyses. for the most part these overlapped the previously characterized proteins on the opposite strand and lacked clearly identifiable ribosome binding sites, and so are not discussed in detail here. examples include two orfs that were found in most or all prophage sequences, encoded in the 00– <dig> prophage by nucleotides  <dig> to <dig> and by nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  if expressed, these orfs would produce proteins with molecular masses of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, that have no homology with any known peptide sequences. in contrast, an orf encoded by nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig> of isolate 00– <dig> appeared to be present only in 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and nc  <dig>  this orf, if expressed and functional, could contribute to differences in biology among the two groups of isolates.

discussion
the finding of cjies  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in a number of campylobacter isolates confirms the observation of parker et al.  <cit>  that these elements appear to be quite widespread in the population. these elements also appeared to be present in similar proportions of the population in the present work and that of parker et al.  <cit> .

prophages homologous to cmlp  <dig> from strain rm  <dig> were found in 4/ <dig> isolates of walkerton outbreak strain  <dig>  suggesting that the rate of loss or gain of this bacteriophage may be quite high, as previously suggested  <cit> . the fact that two of the walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates lacked prophage could mean that the prophage had no effect on virulence of the isolates. however, it is not know whether the prophage was lost from these isolates before infecting humans or upon culture and subculture in the laboratory; no firm conclusions on the association of the presence of the prophage and the virulence of isolates can be drawn. the prophage was also not found in the single human isolate of walkerton outbreak strain  <dig>  tested, and was not present in a number of other isolates obtained from human stools. however, too few animal isolates were tested to draw any conclusions about the association of cmlp  <dig> and its homologs with particular hosts.

it was interesting that no lysogenic phage dna homologous to phage λ was found in the genome of any isolate, as this phage family plays the predominant role in the pathogenesis of many members of the enterobacteraceae. c. jejuni and c. coli share environmental niches, including the human intestinal environment, with salmonella and e. coli isolates carrying lambdoid prophages partially responsible for the virulence of these organisms. the complete absence of lambdoid prophages from campylobacter, if proven true in the long term, could indicate that these bacteria lack receptors for infection by lambdoid phages, that there are effective barriers to lysogeny by these phages, or that the genes carried by these phages do not provide a sufficient selective advantage to the organism to be stably maintained in the population.

if one assumes that the presence of genes from the beginning, middle, and end of cjie  <dig> indicates the presence of the whole element, it can be seen that this element is present in a number of isolates from which cmlp  <dig>  is absent. this in turn indicates that these elements can be inherited independently, though the data do not allow a distinction between the existence of cjie  <dig> as a mobile element versus the differential carriage of the two elements through gain or loss of cjie  <dig>  results from southern blots using probes to cjie  <dig> are somewhat more difficult to interpret due to the fact that the two genes tested are present in different frequencies in the population. future work will concentrate on this element alone.

phages homologous to cmlp  <dig> were found in  <dig> of  <dig> reference isolates from the uk that represent much of the variability within c. jejuni found by mlst  <cit> . the isolates carrying these genes were from different geographic sources than either strain rm  <dig> or the isolates analyzed in this work, suggesting that variants of this bacteriophage are widely distributed in c. jejuni populations and that the phage may have been acquired early in the evolution of this organism. it was considered somewhat surprising, therefore, that only three major groups of cmlp  <dig> homologs were found when dna sequences were analyzed phylogenetically. sequence comparisons indicated that the cmlp  <dig> homolog carried by isolate nc  <dig> showed evidence of recombination with the other two groups of phage as well as the acquisition and incorporation of novel dna sequences. this was supported by our inability to obtain sequence further upstream of the cje <dig> gene with primers that produced pcr amplicons from other isolates, a finding that suggests that this region contains unique dna sequences in nc  <dig>  the nc  <dig> cmlp  <dig> homolog appeared to be highly related to strain  <dig>  in all proteins for which sequence was available from genbank. future work will involve cloning and sequencing further regions of nc  <dig> using strain  <dig>  sequences for developing pcr primers.

cmlp  <dig> homologs from isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and nc  <dig> had similar structural features, including a  <dig> bp deletion and a  <dig> bp sequence quite distinct from the analogous sequence in cmlp  <dig>  this  <dig> bp sequence, as well as a  <dig> bp sequence replacement common to most prophages analyzed in this study, had a somewhat higher % g+c than the overall prophage sequence and the c. jejuni genome as a whole, suggesting that these sequences were acquired from an organism other than c. jejuni. recombination appeared to have a major role in the diversification of the prophages under study. because the  <dig> bp replacement sequence was found in all prophages except nc  <dig> and rm  <dig>  we would speculate that this event may have occurred first in the evolution of the prophages studied here. the  <dig> bp replacement was present in only a subset of these prophages, and would appear to have been acquired later. finally, the  <dig> bp replacement was found in only a small subgroup containing the three walkerton outbreak isolates, suggesting that it was acquired last. most of the insertions and deletions appear to be strain-specific, and suggest fairly frequent changes in the prophage dna sequence. the finding of the  <dig> bp deletion in both nc  <dig>  and in the group containing the walkerton isolates  suggests that at least some of the prophage sequence changes could be modified by additional recombination events. this makes the construction of a tidy evolutionary tree difficult for these integrated bacteriophages.

the 100% sequence identity of isolates 00– <dig>  00– <dig>  and 00– <dig> supports the classification of these isolates as clones of the walkerton outbreak strain  <dig>  <cit> . the other canadian isolate from this group, 00– <dig>  was recovered in ontario but, in typing studies, had different genetic and phenotypic characteristics from the walkerton outbreak strain  <dig> isolates. the final isolate  with a dna sequence similar to this group was recovered in the uk in  <dig>  and so represents an isolate from quite a different geographic location and time. it seems as though the different prophage families characterized in this work have become geographically widespread. though the sampling of putative prophages included here is very small and only part of the phage genome was sequenced in each case, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a global distribution of campylobacter temperate phages with similar sequences. it is also possible that there are more families of sequence variants yet to be discovered.

it was interesting that the start codons preceding orfs in most prophage genes, including those of cmlp  <dig> in rm  <dig>  were identical to consensus start codons for campylobacter. since cmlp  <dig> was previously induced from rm  <dig>  <cit> , this observation suggests that at least some of the prophage homologs found in other isolates may also be competent for induction and the subsequent production of infectious phages. it also suggests that these mu-like prophages are well adapted to campylobacter and that campylobacter may be the preferred or unique host of these phages, an hypothesis supported by the fact that the % g + c of the sequenced part of the prophages is very close to that of previously sequenced c. jejuni genomes . at this time, however, we have no experimental evidence to support this possibility, and the prophage dna in these isolates may be part of inactive prophage remnants. induction of prophages and infection of campylobacter spp. and other genera with the resulting infectious bacteriophage particles will be the subject of future work.

the effect of variations in phage dna sequence on the resulting protein sequence was readily apparent. some proteins had amino acid sequences quite different from the corresponding rm  <dig> sequence, so much so that one would expect the function of the protein to be highly modified or abrogated. most insertions and deletions were in-frame, so that a full-length protein was made. in these cases, it is possible that the expressed proteins might have modified function. several proteins appeared to have potential n-terminal extensions compared with the rm  <dig> homolog, though it is not clear whether these would be included in the final protein product. alternate start codons were responsible for the possible presence of some of these n-terminal peptide extensions. these data confirm observations previously submitted by others to genbank for isolate cf93- <dig>  further proteomics and functional studies will be necessary to answer some of the questions raised by the sequence analysis presented here and elsewhere.

bacteriophages have critically important roles in genome diversification and the evolution of virulence and host adaptation of other enteric bacteria  <cit> . genes encoding shiga toxins   <dig> and  <dig> are found on lambdoid phages in shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, while similar gifsy and fels phages encode a number of virulence factors in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  <cit> . some of these prophage-encoded s. typhimurium proteins are effectors translocated into eucaryotic cells by type three secretion systems encoded at other locations in the chromosome  <cit> . in addition to carrying genes encoding virulence factors, integrated prophage can affect gene expression of the host bacterium  <cit> . while much less is known about the role of mu phages than lambdoid phages in enteric bacteria, it is possible that mu phages also affect the biology and virulence of their host in similar ways. this work shows that the putative campylobacter prophages exhibit at least some of the properties, including a modular or mosaic structure, in common with prophages from other enteric bacteria, thereby supporting the possibility that they may also have similar functions in virulence and the biology of the bacteria. no morons that could be novel virulence genes were found during the partial sequencing of the cmlp  <dig> prophage homologs in c. jejuni isolates. to address whether additional novel genes might be present in other parts of the prophage, future work will involve completion of the dna sequences of a subset of the prophages discussed here. it would also be of interest to determine, using expression dna microarrays, quantitative rt-pcr, and 2d-dige, whether prophage genes are expressed and whether the presence of integrated mu-like prophages affects the expression of campylobacter chromosomal genes. initial work can be done using a naturally occurring strain pair with and without the prophage  <cit> , though ideally isogenic strains would be created by phage transduction of a prophage-negative isolate. the fact that these prophages appear to be fairly common suggests that they confer biological properties that can be advantageous to the bacterial host under some circumstances. determining what those circumstances are may provide valuable insight into the biology and virulence of human-pathogenic campylobacter.

CONCLUSIONS
cmlp  <dig> and its homologs appear to represent a temperate bacteriophage family that is widely distributed and frequently carried within the campylobacter jejuni population. phages in this family appear to have undergone some differentiation, and may be continuing to evolve. future studies are required to understand how these bacteriophages interact with their host bacteria, and what implications this has for the pathogenesis, ecology, survival, and growth of these bacteria.
