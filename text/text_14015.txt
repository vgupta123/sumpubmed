BACKGROUND
boar taint is defined as an unpleasant flavour and odour of porcine meat. it is mainly two compounds that contribute to boar taint. 3-methylindole, also called skatole, is a metabolite of tryptophan metabolism and is produced by intestinal bacteria in the hindgut of the pigs  <cit> . when cooking, skatole released from fat, gives the meat a faecal-like smell. androstenone, a more urine smelling compound is also accumulated in adipose tissue. it is biosynthesised from cholesterol in boar testes . it was previously found that levels of both compounds are linked to sexual maturity of male pigs  <cit>  and that there is a relationship between their metabolisms  <cit> . it has been shown that androstenone, at least in vitro, can inhibit metabolism of skatole by cyp2e <dig>  <cit> . the heritability of levels of both compounds is substantially ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for skatole and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for androstenone in the landrace and duroc breeds  <cit>  but the level of accumulated compound varies between breeds  <cit> .

in most pig-producing countries castration is used to avoid boar taint. however, castration of male pigs also results in reduced feed conversion efficiency as well as in a reduction in carcass trait values . ongoing research in the area of dietary composition in relation to biosynthesis of skatole shows that certain carbohydrates influences the micro-flora and hence skatole production. an increase in faecal wet and dry weight is observed when the diet comprises unsaturated carbohydrates  <cit>  and the consequent decrease in the transit time in the intestine has an influence on the level of absorbed skatole  <cit> . however, dietary composition does not affect the level of androstenone. immunocastration by improvac™ in relation to levels of both androstenone and indolic compounds has shown promising results  <cit> . the sexual development is inhibited by disrupting the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis. as a result, the development of testes and hormone synthesis is hindered thereby suppressing androstenone synthesis. furthermore, lower levels of testicular steroids in immunocastrates accelerate the metabolic clearance of indolic compounds  <cit> . however, as the second vaccination has to be applied to rather large animals a need for a more practical procedure is recommended  <cit> . the cost of vaccinating the boars and the loss of their preferred carcass traits and feed consumption is still an issue.

enzymes and regulatory proteins relating to both androstenone and skatole concentrations have been reviewed in several papers  <cit>  and  <cit> . androstenone along with other steroid hormones are synthesized from pregnenolone or progesterone through the formation of  <dig> -androstadien-3β-ol or  <dig> -androstadien-3-one, respectively. in the first process two genes, cyb17a <dig> and cyb <dig>  are involved in this synthesis  <cit> . it is controlled by the neuroendocrine system which also regulates other testicular steroids. in the second process the gene cyp <dig> is involved  <cit> . both skatole and androstenone accumulates in fat and the degradation takes place in the liver through both phase i and phase ii metabolism before excretion. the hepatic metabolism in phase i degradation of androstenone is mediated by 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes  <cit>  and influenced by the presence of nadh and nadph as cofactors  <cit>  whereas skatole is controlled by cyp2e <dig>  <cit> , cyp2a  <cit>  and aldehyde oxidase  <cit> . phase ii of the hepatic metabolism involves sulfotransferases  <cit>  and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase enzymes  <cit> . in addition, nuclear receptors are believed to play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in androstenone and skatole metabolism  <cit> .

different approaches have been made to link candidate genes to boar taint. one approach is to locate a genomic region associated with the trait and hence use the candidate gene approach to identify the gene or genes in question. a number of quantitative trait loci  and association studies involving both purebred and crossbred pedigrees have been conducted and genes have been located within some of these qtl regions  <cit> . another method is to use gene expression analysis where differentially expressed genes in different tissues have revealed new candidate genes  <cit> . some of the candidate genes that are likely to have an impact on the level of boar taint have been summarised by moe et al.   <cit>  who performed an association study of single nucleotide polymorphisms  located in the candidate genes. recently, grindflek et al.   <cit>  analysed differential expression of  <dig> selected candidate genes found in testes of animals from the norwegian duroc and landrace with high and low levels of androstenone. their investigation revealed that  <dig> of the genes were differentially expressed. among these only cyb5a was cis-regulated.

using snps genotyped in three different danish pig breeds using the porcinesnp <dig> beadchip we aim to identify genomic regions associated with skatole, androstenone, indole as well as the s/i index, which is a skatole equivalent measured by the slaughterhouse containing both skatole and indole. a comparison of the qtl identified within and between breeds in relation to the different traits will be conducted. by implementing a new definition of qtl haplotypes, where snps are included if they are highly associated, we aim to increase the probability of discovering markers linked to qtl. the ultimate objective is to identify haplotypes that can be used directly in a marker assisted selection  strategy to breed for preferred levels of the boar taint traits. finally, candidate genes associated to the qtl regions will be discussed.

RESULTS
genotyping and data validation
a total of  <dig> animals were genotyped on the illumina porcinesnp <dig> beadchip resulting in  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  segregating snps in duroc , danish landrace  and yorkshire , respectively. all samples had a call rate above  <dig>  and all snps selected for further analysis had a call frequency above  <dig> . all snps were validated with regard to hardy-weinberg proportions  and minor allele frequency . a total of  <dig>  snps in d,  <dig>  snps in l and  <dig> snps in y were discarded due to low hwp p-values . in addition, a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps in d, l and y, respectively, were removed due to low maf. the number of tag snps  <cit>  for each of the three breeds were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for d, l and y, respectively. the genome-wide bonferroni significance levels  for the three breeds were found to be p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and p =  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  respectively. chromosome-wide bonferroni significance levels  were calculated from the amount of tag snps representing the different chromosomes. the levels varied between p =  <dig> × 10- <dig> and p =  <dig> × 10- <dig> depending on the number of segregating markers in the breed and the size of the chromosome. as expected from previous findings the traits showed great variation between the breeds . the phenotypic traits were adjusted using log base  <dig> to obtain a gaussian distribution. compared to previous studies  <cit> , the skatole level within the l population is significantly higher in the present study.

quantitative trait loci  analysis
the porcine genome was scanned by a simple approach to identify regions for further analysis. by using a simplified analysis it is expected to detect a number of spurious qtl in addition to the true qtl. the qtl identified by this scan should be seen as suggestive candidate regions. a total of  <dig> suggestive qtl were identified within the three porcine breeds. in total,  <dig> showed associations to androstenone,  <dig> to skatole, eight to the combined trait of both skatole and indole  and nine to indole. initially, four qtl were identified to be significant at the 5% genome-wide bonferroni level, and two at the 1% level. however, only  <dig> were confirmed by the haplotype and single marker analysis .

haplotype analysis and qtl effect
the phased haplotype analysis for each of the suggestive qtl was conducted on snp-sets containing between four and  <dig> snps identified within a single breed . the haplotype analysis identified between two and  <dig> haplotypes with a frequency of more than  <dig> % accounting for  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the data. the most frequent haplotype identified by the haplotype algorithm was analysed for an additive fixed effect by a mixed model taking into account the sire, dam, season, herd and pen random effects. in  <dig> out of  <dig> cases the most frequent haplotype had a significant fixed effect on the level of the trait. in one case the second most frequent haplotype was analysed as well. this was done as mean value represented by the second most frequent haplotype showed a larger deviation from the total mean than the most frequent. in addition, the number of animals carrying the two haplotypes was similar. the frequencies of the tested haplotypes were between  <dig> % and  <dig> %. in seven qtl the fixed effect of the haplotype had a negative value. this was true when the analysed haplotype would increase the boar taint level.

in three cases the identified qtl was explained by a single snp. in these cases the genotype was analysed by the same additive mixed model as haplotypes were. when analysing the effects of being a carrier of the most frequent allele within the snps, the snp in l affecting indole on ssc  <dig> showed a fixed effect of  <dig>  μg/g , whereas, the fixed effect of the two snps affecting androstenone on ssc  <dig> in l and on ssc  <dig> in y were identified to be  <dig>  μg/g  and  <dig>  μg/g , respectively.

body trait analysis
since meat content and slaughter weight could potentially be affected by some of the genes that affect boar taint compounds it was decided not to include these two traits in the mixed model. instead, we examined the derived haplotypes with respect to both meat content and slaughter weight. for six out of the  <dig> haplotypes, a significant effect between slaughter weights and the haplotype was also found. in one of these cases the meat content was also affected by the haplotype differentiation . the six haplotypes affected by the slaughter weight were further analysed to see the effect of the weight on the trait. this was done by the mixed model including the slaughter weight and in one case also the meat content as covariates. as expected the fixed effect of the haplotype was reduced for all haplotypes investigated . none of the single markers were affected by the body traits.

discussion
this gwas identified  <dig> chromosomal regions affecting the four analysed boar taint traits. the highly associated snps around the qtl peak were used to identify haplotypes describing the genetic variation affecting the qtl. the snp-sets were analysed by use of a probability based phasing algorithm implemented to infer haplotypes. of the  <dig> suggestive qtl,  <dig> were confirmed using a haplotype analysis by contrasting the most abundant haplotype to the rest of the haplotypes with an additive effects model. the qtl and haplotype analysis was performed in the three danish breeds duroc, landrace, and yorkshire, separately. a total of  <dig> haplotypes were found to significantly affect androstenone, two to affect pure skatole, six to affect pure indole and seven to affect a skatole equivalent  containing both skatole and indole. in addition, slaughter weight and meat content were analysed and sometimes found to be significantly affected by the qtl haplotype. by including slaughter weight and meat content as covariates in the mixed model the fixed effects for the haplotypes were adjusted. the sample size of each breed was limited . therefore qtl discovered here should be validated using larger samples of the same populations. however, the number of half sib families analysed resembles the number found in a previous study  <cit> . also as at most two offspring from each nucleus family were included, we are convinced that a large part of the genetic variation within each breed was represented in the data. in addition, by introducing haplotypes capturing the total genetic variance within the qtl region, and not only within haplotype blocks split by the four gamete rule as is a more conventional approach  <cit> , it was possible to select and combine information from markers likely to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with whatever regulates the trait. these two things in combination might explain the relatively large effects found in this study.

qtl analysis
previous studies of qtl affecting androstenone in fat identified genomic regions on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, a substantial number of genome regions affecting fat androstenone were identified in the three purebred populations analysed. the affected chromosomal regions that were confirmed by the haplotype analysis were located on the following chromosomes:  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

few studies have been conducted to identify genome regions affecting skatole in fat. however, the two most recent studies by grindflek et al.   <cit>  detected qtl regions affecting both skatole and indole on nine different chromosomes. in total, ten chromosomes have been identified to harbour qtl affecting skatole and the ssc locations are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in the current study, regions affecting skatole were identified on ssc  <dig> and  <dig>  in relation to indole, the current study identified seven chromosomal regions to be affected. these were located on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, segmental regions identified to be affected by the s/i index were found on ssc  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

analysis within and between breeds
the qtl affecting the indole and s/i index trait, identified on ssc  <dig> in l, was the only qtl found to overlap within a breed. as indole is part of the s/i index an overlap in qtl region between these two traits is not surprising. overlaps were also observed between breeds, however, mostly within the same trait. the qtl on ssc  <dig>  found to affect androstenone, was segregating in all breeds, but it was only explained by a single snp in l. an overlap could also be observed between the qtl for androstenone in d and the qtl for the s/i-index in y on ssc  <dig>  in addition, the qtl on ssc  <dig> previously described in l also overlap a qtl within the same region in y. the relatively small overlap in qtl could be expected based on the knowledge of the different distribution of the boar taint traits observed within the three breeds and in relation to possible fixed alleles.

haplotype analysis in relation to androstenone
a suggestive qtl reducing the level of androstenone was observed in d on ssc  <dig>  it was confirmed by the haplotype analysis. the most frequent haplotype showed a fixed effect of  <dig>  μg/g, which is relatively small compared to other effects identified in the present study. however, as the frequency of the haplotype is around 34%, it is possible to increase the population frequency by selection. one of the genes previously identified as being involved in androstenone biosynthesis was located within the qtl region, i.e., the gene st5ar <dig>  also called srd5a <dig>  a number of steroids are catabolised by this enzyme along with srd5a <dig> into their 5α-reduced metabolites  <cit> . in addition, srd5a <dig> is also involved in androstenone formation by catabolising the final step from  <dig> -androstadien-3-ene  <cit> . variation of snps within the srd5a2-3'utr has previously been shown to be associated to plasma levels of androstenone in a norwegian landrace population by a haplotype analysis  <cit> . as low androstenone level was associated with low level of estrone sulphate, they concluded that this haplotype is less desirable for selection purposes because of potentially reduced reproduction.

on ssc  <dig> the qtl identified to affect androstenone in duroc overlap the one identified in a norwegian duroc population  <cit> . in order to keep the level of fertility in the population they also investigated how the qtl would affect the level of testosterone and estrogens. they found that most of the qtl shown to affect androsterone also affected one or more of the other hormones except the one identified on ssc  <dig>  in the current study, the fixed effect was found to be  <dig>  μg/g and highly significant, and the frequency of the haplotype was rather abundant . an analysis to find the proportion of explained phenotypic variance for the haplotype was conducted. here it was found that the haplotype explained around  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance. high levels of variance explained for snps in a number of different genes have previously been described in a norwegian duroc population  <cit> . as  <dig> % of the animals were included in the test and only four haplotypes were identified within this qtl the haplotype appears as a possible candidate for use in breeding efforts.

the qtl identified on ssc  <dig> between d and androstenone was also confirmed by the haplotype analysis. the haplotype showed a relatively large fixed effect  that explained around  <dig> % of the total variance. a qtl analysis conducted in a meishan × large white population revealed a genome-wide significant peak within the same area  <cit> . in the current study the peak snp was found to be located within an intron of the gene loc <dig> . previously, nat <dig>  involved in phase ii metabolism in the liver has been shown to be differentially expressed when analysing extreme high vs. extreme low androstenone duroc and norwegian landrace animals  <cit> .

the qtl identified in d on ssc  <dig> that regulates the level of androstenone was also identified in y and by a single snp in l. all suggestive qtl were confirmed by the haplotype analysis. in d the most abundant haplotype  showed a fixed effect , which was the highest effect on androstenone in the entire study. further investigation revealed that this particular haplotype explained about  <dig> % of the total variance. the fixed effect in y and l was not as high,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, and no significant result on the variance could be achieved for these haplotypes.

in l, four additional qtl regions affecting the level of androstenone were confirmed by the haplotype analysis. on ssc  <dig> a very broad region spanning  <dig>  kb was identified. in the study by grindflek et al.  <cit> , three qtl regions were identified on this chromosome. one of these qtl, referred to as 7a in their paper, overlaps the region found here. however, the region identified in this study also overlaps another qtl previously detected. the cyp <dig> gene was selected as a candidate gene and further analysed, however, they found that no snp in the coding part of the cyp <dig> gene could explain the association  <cit> . the cyp <dig> gene is involved in formation of  <dig> -androstadien-3-ene from progesterone  <cit> . in this study we found that the snp umb <dig>  which was located within an intron of the cyp21a <dig>  gene, was associated with the qtl . the gene cyp <dig> has previously been shown to be down regulated in high androstenone norwegian landrace boars  <cit> .

on ssc  <dig> in l we identified another suggestive qtl. in this case the analysis of the most common haplotype within the qtl did not show a significant association between the haplotype and trait. however, the second most frequent haplotype seemed to deviate more from the total mean and hence was analysed instead. in this case the haplotype showed a large effect  and it was found that this haplotype explained about  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance. a candidate gene located within the region is the gene cyb5a . pregnenolone is converted to  <dig> -androstadien-3β-ol by the andien-β synthase. the andien-β synthase activity is catalyzed by cytochrome p450c <dig> and depends on adequate levels of cyb5a  <cit> . the level of cyb5a in testis hence has an indirect impact on the amount of produced androstenone. a snp  at base - <dig> upstream of atg in the 5'untranslated region of cyb5a was studied in relation to plasma and back fat traits related to boar taint in swedish landrace × yorkshire crossbred pigs  <cit> . the analysis showed weight dependent positive effect of having the t allele in both plasma androstenone and back fat skatole. however, they concluded that it should not be implemented due to the lack of change in back fat androstenone that might be due to the low allele frequency of the t allele in the population.

one of the qtl identified on ssc  <dig> to affect androstenone was found to overlap a region affecting skatole reported by grindflek et al.   <cit> . further investigations of the area will be needed before including this qtl in a breeding scheme.

haplotype analysis in relation to the indolic compounds
a total of five qtl verified by the haplotype analysis in relation to indole and the s/i index seemed to be influenced by the slaughter weight as well as the trait. hence, the haplotype were re-analysed to account for the effects of the slaughter weight. for the three s/i index qtl on ssc  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> identified in y, y and l the fixed effect dropped by  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  μg/g, respectively, when including the slaughter weight as a covariate. the amount of variance explained by the haplotype was analysed to see how it was affected by including the slaughter weight in the model. surprisingly, the values were still high;  <dig> % in y on ssc 6a,  <dig> % in y on ssc  <dig> and  <dig> % in l on ssc <dig>  were only the one on ssc  <dig> had changed markedly . even though the fixed effect decreased in these cases, the explained variance only changed marginally. the fixed effect of the haplotype identified from the chromosome 10b qtl in d also showed a decrease . this qtl overlap a qtl for both skatole and indole previously identified in the landrace population  <cit> .

only two qtl identified to affect skatole were confirmed by the haplotype analysis, namely, the one on ssc  <dig> in y and the one in d on ssc  <dig>  the qtl identified in d on ssc  <dig> overlap a qtl identified to affect both testosterone and esterone sulphate in a norwegian landrace population  <cit> . besides, they identified a qtl affecting both skatole and androstenone in a norwegian duroc population to be located closer to the centromere region than the one identified in this study. in the current study, a suggestive qtl for androstenone was also detected . a candidate gene for the qtl on ssc  <dig> is the sult1a <dig>  gene. this gene has not yet been aligned to the porcine assembly, but comparative mapping of human genes within the area of sult1a <dig> suggests that the gene is likely to be located around  <dig> - <dig>  mb on ssc  <dig> sscrofa <dig>  in addition, the peak snp  was found to be located within the xpo <dig> gene situated only  <dig>  mb from sult1a <dig> in humans. furthermore, the gene has been mapped by linkage analysis to ssc  <dig>  <cit> . this gene is known to be involved in phase ii metabolism of skatole  <cit> . in addition, a suggestive qtl on ssc  <dig> identified to affect skatole in the y breed that could almost be distinguished by the haplotype analysis  overlap the region reported in a norwegian landrace population  <cit> . this region was also reported by quintanilla et al.  to affect back fat androstenone  <cit> .

the qtl identified and confirmed by the haplotype analysis on ssc  <dig> in both l and y affecting indole, and in l also the s/i index, could be regulated by the candidate gene cyp2e <dig> . this gene is a phase i liver metaboliser of skatole . in addition, the cyp2e <dig> gene has previously been shown to be a major metaboliser of indole in rats  <cit> . the umb <dig> snp situated within an intron of the gene was found to be significantly associated with the qtl  in l for both traits. however, this snp was not segregating in the y population; instead, another snp was identified in relation to the gene. the siri <dig> flanked the cyp2e <dig> at the 5' side of the gene  and was found to be significantly association to the qtl . for both of the haplotypes identified in relation to indole the fixed effects seemed small . the negative values indicate that for the most frequent haplotype in these qtl the average level of indole was higher. by analysing the explained variance for the haplotypes it was found that the level was similar to previously identified values  <cit> . the variance explained by the haplotype regulating indole in l was  <dig> %, but the level identified in y was much higher:  <dig> %. the variance explained by the s/i index in l was  <dig> %.

none of the breeds showed any association to the pure skatole measure within the chromosome region on ssc  <dig>  one of the issues that have been discussed during the past decade is the inability to detect a skatole qtl in relation to cyp2e <dig>  <cit> . the difference in bacterial load in the animals and hence the synthesis of the compounds might explain the lack of qtl. indole is produced in a single step by a large variety of bacteria whereas the two-step formation of skatole is specific and dependent on certain bacteria strains. the first step from tryptophan to indole-3-acetic acid is done by escherichia coli and clostridium  <cit> . the second step converts the indole-3-acetic acid into skatole. this is done by the genera clostridium and a lactobacillus strain  <cit> . the genetic composition of an animal does not depend on whether the skatole is produced or not. if a proportion of the animals have less skatole due to a low bacterial load their genetic ability to metabolise the compound can still be rather poor but give a "false" low trait value in relation to their genetics. in addition, indole and skatole are both broken down by cyp2e <dig> in the liver as described above but as the level of indole is not affected by the composition of bacteria we see a perfect association to the genetics in the area around the gene. the same applies for the skatole equivalent trait. as indole is part of the trait we get a more balanced trait in relation to the genetics. in a study by lanthier et al.   <cit>  intestinal skatole were measured to distinguish high and low producers. they found that only the high producers showed a strong correlation between fat skatole and the level of sult1a <dig>  this might be due to the same principle as described above. however, the more recent studies on norwegian pure bred animals showed association of skatole and indole to affect the genomic region in both landrace and duroc  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we conducted qtl analysis of four traits related to boar taint in three different danish breeds. more than half of the suggestive qtl that were identified were confirmed by the haplotype analysis and many of them also by previous findings. a number of candidate genes were identified. in relation to androstenone the genes srd5a <dig>  loc <dig>  cyb5a and cyp21a <dig> were located within qtl in either duroc or landrace. in addition, the genes that might influence the level of skatole and indole within the identified qtl were sult1a <dig>  and cyp2e <dig>  identification of causal variation within the candidate genes will further advance attempts to apply genetic markers to select for reduced boar taint.
