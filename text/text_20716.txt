BACKGROUND
fertilization is a critical event at the onset of mammalian development. the widespread use of artificial insemination has revealed great variation in fertility among sires  <cit> . some males display reduced fertility that can be overcome with higher semen volume for insemination, called compensable infertility, while others show an uncompensable infertility  <cit> .

uncompensable infertility defects may result from molecular defects caused by abnormalities in spermatozoal dna, rna, or proteins, which impair the ability of spermatozoa to interact with oocytes and induce embryonic development  <cit> . the quality of nuclear vacuoles, dna integrity, and chromatin structure have been proposed as potential causes of uncompensable fertility defects  <cit> . however, most causes of bull subfertility are still unknown and are likely multigenic.

recent advances in animal genome sequencing and associated technologies are providing new insights into the genomics study of gametes and embryos  <cit> . for instance, high-throughput technologies, including massively parallel expression and protein quantification, have revealed numerous differences between the spermatozoa of subinfertile and fertile males  <cit> . these phenotypes reflect, among other things, the genetic differences among the various sires. single nucleotide polymorphisms  which represent the most abundant genomic variation, have proved useful in studies of genes associated with human diseases   <cit>  and economically important traits in livestock   <cit> . the previous use of snps for fertility studies has been limited to a few markers, and their implication in male infertility has not yet been fully demonstrated  <cit> .

the objective of the present study was to use a high-throughput and a high-density snp array to conduct a near-genome-wide association study of bull fertility. spermatozoa dna were isolated from well-characterized low fertility  and high fertility  bulls  and examined for approximately  <dig>  snps, followed by the screening of the four most significant snps in a larger population .

methods
bull selection
pure holstein bulls were selected based on their fertility as previously described by peddinti et al.  <cit> . briefly, the progeny test program from alta genetics inc.  involving approximately  <dig> farms milking an average of  <dig> cows each was used to select the bulls . this program provides certain benefits, including dna verification of the paternity of offspring and pregnancy diagnoses by veterinary palpation, instead of relying solely on non-return rates 60– <dig> days after breeding. this depth of data allows an accurate determination of both male and female fertility traits. in addition, this program provides unique research materials to identify molecular markers associated with fertility.

definition of low- and high-fertility bulls
the fertility of bulls , drawn from a total population of  <dig> bulls, is based on an average of  <dig> breeding, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . we used the model described by zwald et al.  <cit> , which takes in account the breeding event, environmental factors and herd management factors that influence fertility performance of sires . all these factors were adjusted using threshold models similar to the previously published models  <cit> . the fertility prediction of each bull was obtained using the probit.f <dig> software  <cit>  and expressed as the percent deviation  of its conception from the average conception of all bulls. for the qtl analysis, the fertility was converted to a z-score.

isolation of pure sperm cells and dna extraction
alta genetics inc.  provided frozen semen straws of selected bulls. thawed spermatozoa were then purified through a percoll gradient, washed, counted, and pelleted for dna isolation  <cit> . dna was extracted from a pool of three different ejaculates of spermatozoa using the puregene dna isolation kit , with minor modifications. spermatozoa were homogenized in the lysis buffer , incubated for  <dig> minutes at 55°c, and treated with rnase a . proteins were sedimented and dna was subsequently precipitated using isopropanol. dna was washed in ethanol, dissolved in te buffer , and quantified using the nanodrop nd- <dig> spectrophotometer . dna integrity was verified on an electrophoresis gel stained-agarose. dna samples with high purity  and no degradation were used for the phase i and phase ii studies.

snp genotyping 
the  <dig> k snp bovine gene chip  was used to genotype dna samples  of  <dig> low-fertility and  <dig> high-fertility bulls. the experiment was carried out at baylor college of medicine , and assays utilized molecular inversion probe  technology, allowing the multiplex detection of single base variants using a 4-color array hybridization assay  <cit> . the hybridization, washing, staining, and chip scanning procedures were performed using the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer  of  <dig>  snps analyzed in all dna samples, the pass and completeness rates were  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively.

allelic discrimination analysis 
the allelic discrimination technique, based on the taqman technology  was performed by scientists at seqwright, inc. seqwright.com on dna samples  of  <dig> low-fertility and  <dig> high-fertility bulls to validate the phase i association study. primer and probe sets were designed on a sequence of  <dig> nucleotides containing the snp  using the primer express software . the probes were designed and labeled with fam  or vic fluorescent dyes  to match perfectly either one of the alleles .

pcr reactions were carried out in a total volume of  <dig> μl as recommended by the manufacturer. each reaction consisted of  <dig> μl of sperm dna in  <dig> μl master mix solution  containing primers  and probes . dna samples were amplified by  <dig> times . for each pcr run, negative  and positive  controls were added, and each run was preceded or followed by 1-minute incubation at 60°c to determine the background, or final levels of fluorescence, in each reaction. the base calls were made by examining all samples on the allelic discrimination graph, and the sequence detection software  was used to determine the homozygosis or heterozygosis of alleles. all samples were run in triplicates for each snp allele.

bioinformatics
the major repository of snp data in the national center for biotechnology information  database , combined with entrez genome  as well as the ensembl automatic analysis pipeline, were used to characterize and annotate the markers  based on the cattle genome assembly version  <dig> . for each snp, a sequence of  <dig> nucleotides consisting of the  <dig> nucleotides immediately upstream and downstream of the snp allele, were extracted and the best hit in the bovine  <dig>  genome identified using blastn. we considered only the hits  found on the same chromosome as the query,  with e-values equal or close to  <dig>  and  presenting at least 94% alignment with the full length of the query sequence. furthermore, the same query sequences were used to search for putative transcription factor binding sites through the transfac-blastx .

sperm preparation and treatment
thawed spermatozoa were purified through a percoll gradient as previously reported  <cit> . motile spermatozoa were resuspended in the fertilization medium containing heparin and phe. the sperm concentration was adjusted to  <dig> × 106/ml and incubated with or without the integrin beta  <dig> antibody . as a control for structural effects of the antibody, spermatozoa  were also incubated with a nonmammalian protein  antibody . after a 2-hour incubation at 38°c under 5% co <dig> in air, spermatozoa were washed twice in fertilization medium and used to fertilize the oocytes. the motility of spermatozoa was comparable before and after the incubation period.

oocyte maturation and in vitro fertilization
bovine oocytes were purchased from bomed inc. , and maturation took place during the transportation. these oocytes were washed and fertilized with treated and untreated spermatozoa at a final concentration of  <dig> spermatozoa/ml. after  <dig> hours of co-incubation, oocytes were collected, denuded, washed, fixed, and placed on slides for staining with  <dig> % aceto-orcein on slides. the nuclear status of oocytes was observed under a microscope, and the fertilized oocytes  were counted to assess the fertilization rates.

statistical analysis
in the phase i study, the  <dig> bulls of varied fertility were typed for  <dig>  snp using affymetrix  <dig> k xba  <dig>  <dig>  array. a total of  <dig>  markers fixed for a single genotype in this sample were excluded from further analysis. markers were tested for hardy-weinberg equilibrium using a  <dig> degree of freedom chi-square test. markers with a p value <  <dig>  were flagged as potentially out of hwe, but were used for association analysis.

the fertility of the bulls was converted to z-scores and used as the quantitative trait for the association analysis. analysis was conducted only at the markers' positions; no attempt at interval mapping was made. at each marker, the mean fertility, scored as a z-score, was compared between genotypes using single marker regression. if the n for a genotype was  <dig>  the samples were collapsed into the heterozygote. benjamini- hochberg fdr was calculated at each marker, adjusting  <dig>  tests. a p-value less than  <dig>  was set as the threshold of a significant association between the snp marker and bull fertility; this corresponds to an fdr of 84%. similar analyses were conducted in phase ii data.

RESULTS
the lack of methods to accurately predict sire fertility obliges the artificial insemination  industry to keep and test hundreds of bulls. the selection of such bulls, whose fertility has been evaluated with progeny tests prior to their use in large-scale breeding programs, is costly and can take several years. recent advances in cattle genome projects and molecular genetic technologies have increased the likelihood of identifying uncompensatory defects impairing the functions of spermatozoa. high-throughput technologies may help pinpoint relationships between a single dna marker  and economically important traits in dairy cattle. information about specific snps can enhance the efficiency of genetic selection, especially for traits that are  too difficult or expensive to measure in all animals and/or  expressed after a long field trial .

determination of bulls with uncompensatory infertility
the most fertile and the least fertile pure holstein bulls were selected from a pool of  <dig> available bulls with at least  <dig> breeding records. these were defined as the representative outliers for their corresponding groups and the scaling of fertility as the deviation from the population average fertility. the average breeding and fertility rates of the  <dig> low- and  <dig> high-fertility bulls used in the phase i association study were  <dig>  and - <dig> % versus  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. in the phase ii study, these values were  <dig> and - <dig> % for low-fertility , and  <dig> and  <dig> %, for high  fertility bulls . the average differences in fertility rates between low and high fertile groups were  <dig> % and  <dig> % in phase i and phase ii studies, respectively. these differences were considered significant by amann and hammersted,  <dig>  <cit> .

identification of snps associated with fertility using dna microarrays 
the recent progress in genomics and automation has rendered the snp genotyping a promising technology for genetic studies of the cow genome, which contains approximately one snp every  <dig> base pairs  <cit> . using bovine snp genechip microarrays , we successfully genotyped  <dig>  snp markers using bull spermatozoa genomic dna isolated from  <dig> low-fertility and  <dig> high-fertility holstein bulls . approximately 50%  of snps were physically located to chromosomes using the bovine genome assembly btau- <dig>  .

no significant difference was found between the average of snp call rates in both groups . the hwe test revealed an fdr of 61% corresponding to  <dig> snp markers that failed the test , but were used for qtl analysis as mentioned above . a total of  <dig>  snp markers were excluded from analysis because they were not polymorphic. in the phase i samples, the fertility  of bulls was used as the quantitative trait for the association analysis of the remaining  <dig>  markers. the p-value distribution of the  <dig>  markers' test showed a slight deviation from the uniform to left end  of the distribution, indicating the presence of more putative fertility-associated snp markers in the data  than expected at random. additional file  <dig> shows the z-score data obtained from the four snp markers with the highest association , and additional file  <dig> shows the  <dig> significant markers p < 10- <dig>  these most significant markers were selected to test in the phase ii samples.

high-throughput snp arrays are powerful tools commonly used in humans to track population history and genes associated with diseases  <cit>  or fertility  <cit> . the application of a such high-throughput technology has been limited in livestock  <cit> . the  <dig> k snp bovine gene chip commercialized by affymetrix inc. ensures a limited coverage of the cow genome , with one snp every  <dig> to  <dig> kb. however, the snp location on the array seems evenly distributed across the genome   <cit> .

the extent of linkage disequilibrium  around the snps in the holstein population is not clear yet, but we believe the ld may extend a good distance  around the markers due to the extensive inbreeding in the population  <cit> . for example, one specific bull not in this study was found to be an ancestor  <dig> times, often several times in a single bull's ancestors, within  <dig> generations of the bulls in our study. as a result, there may be some founding effects within this study and large stretches of ld, but it is doubtful we were able to fully cover the genome as close to the maximal fisher's information given the marker density and coupled with the low power of this study. this suggests there are additional fertility loci to be found in the genome. the need of higher density snp arrays  has been suggested for power association and fine mapping studies in cattle  <cit> .

genotyping of large numbers of bulls for the most significant snp markers 
large population sizes, often too large to be easily collected, are generally required for defining association between a given snp and a trait with reasonable power. thus, the use of several stages of analysis with progressively fewer markers typed in each replication population has become typical in human genome-wide association studies. the key reliability of a significant association result is replication in a second  population. for example, a genome-wide-association  study of macular degeneration was successfully replicated when the initial study contained only  <dig> cases and  <dig> controls  <cit> . here, we selected the four most significant snps from the genotyping  study  for replication in a larger cohort of  <dig> low- and  <dig> high-fertility bulls . interestingly, the marker rs <dig> out of hwe in the phase i study became in hwe in phase ii, as well as three other markers . the fertility  analysis confirmed the significant association of two of the four snps , while the rs <dig> tended to be significant . our calculated fdr rate for these markers  in the phase i data is very close to our observed replication rate of 50%, which is known as very high for a genome wide association study  <cit> .

bioinformatics on the four highly associated snps
bioinformatics were restricted on the four highest significantly associated snps . only three snps gave valuable information . the snp rs <dig> appeared as a positional marker for the collagen i alpha  <dig> gene, located at  <dig>  base pairs of the 5' side of the snp. the snp rs <dig> had a single hit corresponding to a sequence similar to rab3a-interacting molecule, which might be a potential gene candidate for fertility. the snp rs <dig> is a synonymous polymorphism located in the exon  <dig> of integrin beta  <dig> gene . each of these snps was located in a region  with low density . using similar snp genechip array, daetwyler et al., have reported a snp frequency  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  on bos taurus autosome  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively   <cit> . this observation makes the four snp as strong positional candidate gene markers.

putative binding sites for transcription factors with roles in embryogenesis were found within the nucleotide sequences flanking the snps rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . hence, our findings suggest potential roles of the snp mutations on regulation of gene expressions as already suggested in other studies  <cit> .

taken together, our results provide novel loci candidates whose associations with the bull fertility have not previously been reported. because of the great interest of the non-synonymous snp rs <dig> associated with the itgb <dig>  we performed a six frame translation of itgb <dig> mrna reference sequence reported on ncbi  using the baylor college of medicine's hgsc search launcher to find the reading frame leading to the amino acid change. we found that the complete itgb <dig> protein could be obtained from two different reading frames  when using the whole length of rna sequence or the length from the start codon , respectively. contrary to the ncbi report, we found that the snp mutation site  induced a synonymous amino acid change of a proline  to another proline  at the position  <dig> . the same snp  inducing a synonymous amino acid change  is also reported on the ensembl database.

the interest of integrin beta  <dig> in our study resided in the role played by the integrin family members during fertilization and embryogenesis. integrins are known to be expressed in a variety of tissues, including reproductive tissues of mice, humans, pigs and cattle  <cit> .

functional analysis of integrin beta 5
the biological function of the integrin beta  <dig> subunit is not clearly defined. we tested the potential involvement of itgb <dig> isoform on sperm-egg interaction, and the results showed that the percentages of matured oocytes  undergoing a successful fertilization  with spermatozoa pre-exposed to anti-integrin beta  <dig> antibody were decreased:  <dig>   <dig>  and 47% normally fertilized oocytes in the presence of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μg itgb5/ml, respectively. this dose-dependent inhibition was not attributed to the antibody itself since the pre-exposure of spermatozoa to the non-mammalian protein  antibody had no effect on the ability of spermatozoa to fertilize the oocytes .

we ruled out the likelihood of non-specific interactions of the anti-itgb <dig> antibody and other integrin beta subunits. indeed, the antibody is raised against a specific n-terminal epitope, which amino acid sequence is not found in other subunits of integrin beta protein. therefore, our results contribute to the growing body of reports supporting the presence of αvβ integrins on sperm membranes  <cit> . their putative differential expression in subfertile and fertile bulls could be used as markers for fertility, as already suggested for the αv6β <dig> integrin in humans  <cit> . furthermore, our results contrast with the main body of literature reporting the presence of integrins mainly on the oocyte membrane while their ligands, adam family proteins, are on the sperm membrane  <cit> . in addition to this structural receptor function of integrins at fertilization , integrin beta  <dig> might serve as a signaling receptor that induces serial events  in the sperm, affecting fertilization and early embryo development.

CONCLUSIONS
we have employed a high-density snp genome association study to identify loci that may play a role in fertility in dairy cattle and significant results in two of four loci were replicated in a second population. functional studies, including one for genes harboring a replicated locus, the itgb <dig> gene, suggest that it may play a role in sperm-egg interaction. these results provide a foundation for more hypothesis-driven research in genome biology, evolution, qtl mapping, and discovering genes and genomic regions for selectable traits.
