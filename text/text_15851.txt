BACKGROUND
x chromosome dosage compensation in drosophila melanogaster is achieved by doubling the transcription of most genes on the single x chromosome in male flies  <cit> . this dosage compensation is mediated by the male-specific lethal  complex containing both protein and non-coding rna components  <cit> . the genes encoding the msl proteins were identified through mutagenesis screens, in which the mutant phenotype is male lethality   <cit> . five proteins form the core of the msl complex: msl <dig>  msl <dig>  msl <dig>  mle and the histone acetyl transferase mof, which acetylates histone h <dig> at lysine  <dig>   <cit> . the acetylase activity of mof is essential for male viability  <cit> . there is considerable evidence that these proteins associate in a complex that localises specifically to the male x chromosome  <cit> . the male specificity of the complex is due to msl <dig>  which is negatively regulated at the translational level by the female-specific protein sxl  <cit> .

msl <dig> and msl <dig> are essential and sufficient for binding of a partial complex to ~ <dig> high affinity sites along the x chromosome  <cit> . two of these sites correspond to the genes encoding the non-coding rnas, rox <dig> and rox <dig> , which are part of the msl complex  <cit> . these rnas are redundant, but essential for dosage compensation, although approximately 5% of male rox <dig> rox <dig> double mutants survive as adults  <cit> . it has been proposed that the high affinity binding regions constitute chromatin entry sites, at which the msl complex assembles prior to spreading into flanking regions of chromatin  <cit> . however, chromatin entry sites are not essential for targeting of the msl complex  <cit> . an alternative model proposes that the msl complex is targeted to individual x-linked genes by uncharacterised sequence motifs that are absent from autosomal genes  <cit> . this model is supported by recent high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation studies , which found that msl binding is gene specific  <cit> . however, autosomal genes inserted on the x chromosome can be dosage compensated  <cit> , indicating that bound msl complex may be able to regulate the expression of nearby genes in the chromatin domain.

the x-linked gene larval serum protein  <dig> alpha  appears to escape dosage compensation by the msl complex  <cit> . lsp1α is an abundant protein expressed in the fat body of third instar larvae  <cit> , which forms a complex with autosomal lsp <dig> proteins to act as nutrient reservoir for pupal development  <cit> . lsp1α is not essential for survival, as flies carrying mutations in all of the lsp <dig> genes are viable  <cit> . lsp1α could escape regulation by the msl complex by one of two distinct possibilities. either, it is flanked by boundary elements that block access of the msl complex or it lacks characteristics required to attract the msl complex, such as dna sequences or chromatin composition. both of these models are supported by the observation that the lsp1α gene is either partially or fully dosage compensated when relocated to two other locations on the male x chromosome  <cit> .

in this study we examine possible explanations for why lsp1α is not dosage compensated.

RESULTS
lsp1α is flanked by dosage compensated genes
in order to determine whether lsp1α is the only gene within its chromosomal region to escape dosage compensation, the dosage compensation status of the genes flanking lsp1α was examined. previous work indicated that the gene 5' of lsp1α, cg <dig>  is dosage compensated  <cit> . several other genes in the region near lsp1α were identified after publication of the drosophila genome sequence.

five putative genes exist in the region immediately surrounding lsp1α as predicted by cdna evidence from the drosophila genome project  <cit> : cg <dig>  cg <dig> , cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> . since cg <dig> is separated from lsp1α by two intervening genes, it was not examined in this study. the developmental stage in which lsp1α, cg <dig>  cg <dig> and cg <dig> are expressed was determined by northern rna hybridisation analysis . as expected lsp1α is very highly expressed and easily detected in total rna from third instar larvae . cg <dig> is expressed in all larval stages, as previously reported. four transcripts were detected for cg <dig>  which is downstream of lsp1α . these transcripts are expressed differentially throughout development but importantly are present in third instar larvae. thus, genes 5' and 3' of lsp1α are expressed at the same stage of development. transcripts from cg <dig>  the gene immediately 3' of lsp1α, were not detected at any of the developmental stages analysed using  <dig> μg of poly+ mrna, or in adults using rt-pcr . it is possible that this intron-less gene may be expressed in only a few cells, or may require stimuli not present under standard conditions. since expression could not be detected, it was not examined further in this study. cg <dig> transcripts are present in ~2-fold higher levels in hemisected  adult males compared to females as shown by rnase protection , thus the dosage compensation status of this gene could not be determined. there were slightly higher transcript levels of the rp <dig> loading control in whole adult females than males  as shown previously  <cit> , possibly due to strong ovarian expression. for this reason, hemisected adults or sexed larvae were used in this study for determining a gene's dosage compensation status.

multi-probe quantitative rnase protection analysis was used to determine the dosage compensation status of cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes in first and third instar larvae respectively. control probes detected transcripts from the x-linked dosage compensated 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase   <cit>  and constitutive autosomal ribosomal protein  <dig>   <cit>  genes. first instar larvae were sexed using a stock in which only the male larvae express gfp. female to male cg <dig> and pgd transcript ratios were normalised to rp <dig>  as the  <dig> probes were analysed simultaneously. a female to male transcript ratio of one indicates that a gene is compensated, whereas a female to male ratio of two suggests that a gene is not compensated. cg <dig> and pgd have female to male transcript ratios of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively  indicating that these genes are both dosage compensated. this concurs with the cg <dig> transcript ratios obtained in second instar larvae using an alternative method  <cit> . single probe rnase protection of cg <dig> and lsp1α was conducted in male and female y w staged-third instar larvae relative to pgd and rp <dig>  as both transcripts are present at this developmental stage . female to male cg <dig>  lsp1α and pgd transcript ratios were not normalised to rp <dig>  as the  <dig> probes were analysed separately due to the similar size of the protected rnas. rp <dig> and pgd have female to male transcript ratios of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively , demonstrating equivalent rna levels are present in both sexes. cg <dig> and lsp1α have female to male transcript ratios of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  respectively , indicating that cg <dig> is dosage compensated but lsp1α is not. these results show that two of the genes flanking lsp1α are dosage compensated, and suggest that lsp1α is unique within its chromosomal domain in escaping regulation by the msl complex.

the regions flanking lsp1α do not contain elements able to block dosage compensation of an x-linked transgene
the genes flanking lsp1α are dosage compensated, but lsp1α is not. one possible explanation for why lsp1α escapes dosage compensation is that flanking sequence elements somehow block access of the msl complex to the gene. to test this possibility, the genomic regions between lsp1α and cg <dig>  and between lsp1α and cg <dig>  were inserted either side of an arm-lacz reporter construct . we have previously shown that x-linked arm-lacz transgenes are fully dosage compensated  <cit> , although it is not known if this is due to local spreading of the msl complex or to direct recruitment of the complex. if the lsp1α flanking regions contain elements able to block access of the msl complex, it follows that x-linked i-arm-lacz-i <dig> transgenic lines will not be dosage compensated, and will exhibit female to male reporter activity ratios of two. due to the presence of promoter sequences within the  region, female to male reporter activity ratios were analysed in adult flies, in which only the armadillo promoter is active, rather than in third instar larvae in which both the armadillo and lsp1α promoter sequences are active. all autosomal and x-linked arm-lacz lines had female to male β-galactosidase activity ratios of ~ <dig> . both autosomal i-arm-lacz-i <dig> lines also had female to male β-galactosidase activity ratios of ~ <dig>  the x-linked i-arm-lacz-i <dig> line exhibited a female to male β-galactosidase activity ratio of ~ <dig>  indicating that the  and  regions do not contain elements able to prevent the msl complex from binding to and dosage compensating arm-lacz on the x chromosome.

the precise chromosomal location of these x-linked transgenes was determined by inverse pcr. the i-arm-lacz-i2:19c <dig> transgene has inserted between the x-linked cg <dig> and cg <dig> genes that are uncharacterised with respect to expression and are part of an approx.  <dig> kb gene poor region of the chromosome . the nearest genes that showed significant binding of msl <dig> and msl <dig> in embryos are rab <dig>  and lg <dig>  that are approximately  <dig> kb upstream and 45kb downstream respectively from the site of insertion of the i-arm-lacz-i <dig> transgene  <cit>  . the arm-lacz:10d <dig> transgene has inserted in the first intron of the x-linked inaf  gene, which encodes a protein with calcium channel regulator activity involved in rhodopsin mediated signalling that is expressed in the head and eye of adult flies  <cit> . although, it has not been reported if inaf is dosage compensated, significant binding of msl <dig> is detected at the 3' end of this gene in embryos  <cit> .

lsp1α is not enriched for histone h <dig> acetylated at lysine  <dig> in male larval fat body nuclei
there was no binding of msl <dig> or msl <dig> to lsp1α in embryos or of msl <dig> to lsp1α in sl <dig> cells  <cit>  . this would be the expected result since lsp1α is not dosage compensated. in sl <dig> cells, ~90% of msl <dig> binding clusters were within expressed genes, with an enrichment in the middle and 3' end  <cit> . since lsp1α is not actively expressed in sl <dig> cells it was possible that msl complex could be binding to lsp1α in the tissue in which the gene is expressed, namely third instar larval fat body. as acetylation of h <dig> at lysine  <dig> is dependent on the mof component of the msl complex, we measured the relative level of h4k16ac on lsp1α in larval fat body nuclei by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. chromatin from hand-dissected male y w larval fat body was immunoprecipitated with antibody against h4k16ac. the x-linked, fat body-expressed lipid storage droplet- <dig>  and pgd genes showed  <dig> –  <dig> fold enrichments after immunoprecipitation compared to the autosomal gene, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , which had a relative enrichment of one . the differential levels of enrichment within pgd have been observed previously  <cit> . lsp1α exhibited no enrichment for h4k16ac, confirming the prediction that actively expressed lsp1α would not be acetylated by mof as it is not dosage compensated.

lsp1α promoter-lacz x-linked transgenes are enriched for h4k16ac in larval fat body
since the majority of msl target genes are widely expressed  <cit> , we next investigated if the lsp1α gene was not enriched for h4k16ac because of the high activity and tissue specificity of its promoter. the lsp1α gene promoter was fused to the lacz reporter gene and two x-linked lines containing this gene construct were obtained. chromatin from male lsp1α -lacz:9b <dig> and lsp1α -lacz:19e <dig> third instar larval fat bodies was immunoprecipitated with antibody against h4k16ac . as for the y w strain, the x-linked lsd- <dig> and pgd genes were enriched for h4k16ac. the two x-linked lsp1α -lacz transgenes also showed 3-fold enrichments within lacz. thus the lack of enrichment of h4k16ac within lsp1α is not because of the tissue-specificity of the gene promoter.

there are two possible explanations for why x-linked lsp1α-lacz transgenes were enriched for h4k16ac in larval fat body. either the transgenes have inserted near msl complex target genes or alternatively msl complex is directly recruited to the lacz gene. the latter would seem less likely as the gene is of bacterial origin and msl complex is not recruited to autosomally integrated lacz transgenes  <cit> . the lsp1α -lacz:9b <dig> transgene has inserted in the first intron of the cg <dig> gene. while there are no msl <dig> or msl <dig> binding sites within cg <dig>  there are clusters of sites within the closely adjacent lg <dig> gene in embryos, sl <dig> and clone  <dig> cells . the lsp1α -lacz:19e <dig> transgene has inserted between the cg <dig> and ntf- <dig>  genes. there are clusters of msl <dig> and msl <dig> binding sites within both the cg <dig> and ntf- <dig> genes in embryos, sl <dig> and clone  <dig> cells  <cit>  . while it is not known if cg <dig>  cg <dig> or ntf- <dig> gene are actively expressed and targeted by the msl complex in third instar larval fat body, ntf- <dig> is likely to be expressed in this tissue based on mutant phenotypes  <cit> . that msl complex distribution appears to remain largely stable across development  <cit>  would suggest that msl complex would be bound to the cg <dig>  cg <dig> and ntf- <dig> genes in larval fat body.

cg <dig> is expressed in larval fat body but shows only a moderate enrichment for h4k16ac at the 3' end
if x-linked lsp1α-lacz transgenes are enriched for h4k16ac because they have inserted near msl target genes then why is lsp1α not enriched for h4k16ac as the flanking genes are dosage compensated? since there is a strong correlation between msl complex binding and gene transcription  <cit> , one possibility is that the flanking genes are not transcribed in third instar larval fat body. both cg <dig> and cg <dig> are expressed in third instar larvae , but their tissue distribution is unknown. in order to determine whether cg <dig> and cg <dig> are expressed in the fat body, real-time rt-pcr of cdna from male fat body and whole larvae was conducted on cg <dig> and cg <dig> relative to the fat body specific genes lsp1α  <cit>  and lsd- <dig>  <cit> , and the constitutively expressed genes gpdh and rp <dig>  lsp1α and lsd- <dig> show  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold enrichments respectively in fat body cdna compared to whole third instar larval cdna, while gpdh and rp <dig> show  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold enrichments respectively . cg <dig> demonstrates  <dig> -fold enrichment in fat body cdna compared to whole third instar larval cdna, indicating that it is not expressed in fat body tissue. this is consistent with its proposed function as a structural component of the larval cuticle  <cit>  and specific expression in dorsal and ventral epidermis in late embryos  <cit> . cg <dig> shows  <dig> -fold enrichment in fat body cdna compared to whole third instar larval cdna, indicating that it is expressed in both this tissue and other parts of the larvae. transcripts for the gene immediately 3' of lsp1α, cg <dig>  were not detected in third instar larvae hence it is unlikely that the msl complex is targeted to this gene in fat body tissue.

since cg <dig> is also expressed in fat body we performed chip experiments with isolated fat body nuclei and anti-h4k16ac antibody. there was no enrichment with a 5' utr fragment . further, the 3' utr of cg <dig> is only moderately enriched for this histone modification , suggesting msl complex is not present in high levels in this region of the chromosome in third instar larval fat body, although the gene is clearly dosage compensated. the moderate enrichment of h4k16ac at the 3' end of cg <dig> is consistent with the high-density chip-chip profiles that found that the msl complex binds to intragenic regions, particularly the 3' end of x-linked genes  <cit> .

lsp1α has most likely evolved recently within the melanogaster subgroup of drosophila species
it had been suggested that lsp1α has arisen from a duplication and translocation of an autosomal lsp1β gene  <cit> . the sequencing of the genomes of twelve drosophila species  <cit>  allowed us to address when lsp1α evolved. as expected homologues of lsp1β and lsp1γ were found in all drosophila species examined. lsp1α homologues, however, are only present in the melanogaster subgroup of species, which are thought to have descended from a common ancestor  <dig> –  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  . in these species lsp1α lies between homologues of cg <dig> and cg <dig>  while in the remainder of the species these genes are immediately adjacent . thus it would appear that lsp1α arose relatively recently within the melanogaster subgroup of species and so may not have yet evolved msl binding sites. however, a tree based on maximum likelihood analysis of lsp <dig> sequences  suggests that lsp1α arose before the divergence of drosophila species . if so, then lsp1α has been precisely lost on at least four separate occasions . more likely some residues within lsp1α proteins may not be under the same functional constraints as in lsp1β proteins leading to the observed divergence. the lsp1β gene seems to be particularly prone to duplication events as duplicated lsp1β genes were found in d. ananassae, d. grimshawi and d. willistoni genome sequences . the two lsp1β genes are immediately adjacent to each other in these three species. the maximum likelihood analysis suggests the duplication events have occurred recently within each of the three species.

discussion
lsp1α is a well characterised example of a non-dosage compensated gene  <cit> . in contrast, two genes situated less than  <dig> kb either side of it, are expressed equivalently in male and female larvae. that lsp1α escapes regulation by the msl complex was shown by the lack of enrichment for h4k16ac in the tissue in which it is expressed. these results are consistent with high-resolution chip-chip studies that found that msl complex binding was gene-specific  <cit> . further, the complex bound predominantly to constitutively expressed genes. lsp1α is certainly not a housekeeping gene, but rather is a gene that is very highly expressed in a specific cell type and a specific stage of development. since lsp1α is not an essential gene  <cit>  there would have been little evolutionary pressure to acquire msl binding sites since it evolved, which appears to have been relatively recently in the melanogaster subgroup of species. the only gene in the lsp1α gene region that is bound to msl <dig> and msl <dig> in embryos is rab <dig>  <cit>  , which is approx.  <dig> kb upstream of lsp1α. thus lsp1α appears to have arisen within a region of the x chromosome that has few strong msl binding sites in whole embryos.

in the two-step model for msl complex targeting to x chromosome genes, the complex is initially bound to sequences of higher affinity and then spreads locally to nearby expressed genes  <cit> . such a mechanism would explain why autosomal genes inserted onto the x chromosome can be dosage compensated  <cit> . according to this model, it would be anticipated that the msl complex could spread locally from flanking dosage compensated genes that are active in third instar larval fat cells to lsp1α. of the two flanking dosage compensated genes, only the downstream cg <dig> gene is transcribed in third instar larval fat cells. however, we could not detect any enrichment for h4k16ac at the 5' end and only a modest enrichment for h4k16ac at the 3' end, which is ~ <dig> kb from lsp1α. thus it appears that msl complex does not spread to the lsp1α gene in its normal chromatin location because the level of complex bound to nearby active genes in fat body nuclei is low. the chip-chip studies identified several examples of neighbouring genes that have differential msl binding profiles. it remains to be determined if, like lsp1α, the unbound genes are not enriched for h4k16ac in the cells in which they are actively transcribed. if so, it would be of interest to know if these genes, like lsp1α  <cit> , can respond to the msl complex when relocated to other locations on the x chromosome.

we found no evidence for boundary elements flanking the lsp1α gene that could prevent access of the msl complex to an active gene. an arm-lacz reporter gene bracketed by sequences that flank the lsp1α gene was fully dosage compensated when inserted onto the x chromosome. the msl complex could reach the i-arm-lacz-i <dig> transgene by spreading from a nearby gene with bound complex or could bind directly to the transgene. the i-arm-lacz-i <dig> transgene inserted into a very gene poor region that is largely devoid of bound msl complex in embryos and sl <dig> cells  <cit> . the nearest gene with significant levels of bound complex in embryos is approx.  <dig> kb from the transgene insertion site. the msl complex can spread hundreds of kilobases from an autosomally integrated rox gene  <cit> , so it is possible that the msl complex could spread 45kb along the male x chromosome. it is also possible that msl complex may be bound to more genes in this region in adults, the stage we measured β-galactosidase activity. however, while msl complex binding pattern is not invariant, it is largely similar in distinct cell types  <cit> . thus, while it is clear that lsp1α is not flanked by sequences that prevent access of the msl complex, we cannot conclude if this is because they fail to block local spreading of the complex. if msl complex does not spread locally to the integrated arm-lacz reporter gene, then the transgene must independently recruit msl complex. this may simply be because the msl complex preferentially binds to expressed genes  <cit> . however, transcription is not sufficient to recruit complex. legube et al   <cit>  found that the promoter regions of some msl <dig> target genes are enriched in dref binding sites. the arm promoter has several possible dref binding sites . armadillo is an x-linked constitutively expressed gene  <cit> . the  <dig>  kb arm fragment in the arm-lacz construct contains 5' flanking sequence, the two major start sites of transcription, the first intron and start of second exon  <cit> . there is significant binding of msl <dig> and msl <dig> to this fragment of the arm gene in embryos and sl <dig> cells respectively  <cit> . thus the arm promoter may contribute to recruitment of msl complex to an actively expressed arm-lacz transgene. while arm-lacz transgenes are fully dosage compensated at several locations on the x chromosome  <cit> , there is no binding of the msl complex to autosomally integrated arm-lacz transgenes, which are equally expressed in males and females  <cit> . thus if the arm-lacz transgene can independently recruit msl complex, it can only do so in an x chromosomal environment. clearly additional studies are needed to identify what features of the arm-lacz transgene are important for recruitment of the msl complex. the development of site-specific integration systems for drosophila  <cit>  should greatly facilitate such studies as various gene constructs could all be tested at the same locations on the x chromosome.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we have examined possible explanations for why the x-lined lsp1α gene is not dosage compensated. lsp1α is not enriched for h4k16ac in third instar larval fat body, the tissue in which the gene is actively expressed. thus lsp1α is not compensated because the chromatin is not modified by the msl complex at the gene's normal location on the x chromosome. lsp1α is in a region of the x chromosome that is subject to regulation by the msl complex, as genes flanking and within  <dig> kb of lsp1α are dosage compensated. lsp1α does not appear to be surrounded by sequence elements that prevent access of the msl complex as these flanking regions did not prevent a reporter gene from being dosage compensated when inserted on the x chromosome. the stage-specificity or high activity of the lsp1α promoter does not prevent dosage compensation because x-linked lacz transgenes under the control of the lsp1α promoter were enriched for h4k16ac in larval fat body. only one of the genes flanking lsp1α is expressed in the same tissue as lsp1α and this gene showed no enrichment for h4k16ac at its 5' end  and showed only a modest enrichment at its 3' end in larval fat body. homologues of lsp1α were found only in the melanogaster subgroup of species. the most likely explanation for why lsp1α is not dosage compensated is that the gene has not evolved a mechanism to independently recruit the msl complex, possibly because of its recent evolutionary origin, and because there appears to be a low level of bound msl complex in a nearby gene that is active in the same tissue.

recent chip-chip analyses have identified several expressed x-linked genes that are not bound by the msl complex. the significance of this study is that we have addressed possible mechanisms by which one such gene escapes regulation by the msl complex.
