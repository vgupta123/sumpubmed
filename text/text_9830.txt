BACKGROUND
linkage disequilibrium  is the non-random association between allele frequencies at two loci. recombination rate variation is the main determinant of ld  <cit> . it has been shown that recombination is extremely heterogeneous along the genome, even at short distances, which creates intricate ld patterns. ld is also shaped by demographic forces and natural selection, and has become a tool used to infer population history  <cit>  and selection  <cit> . genome- and population-related factors, then, explain why linkage disequilibrium levels vary dramatically across the genome and among some populations. the extent of ld in non-africans is higher than in africans  <cit> , reflecting the origin and spread of modern humans from africa, although the difference in ld between africans and non-africans varies greatly across loci, with examples in which it is similar or even more pronounced in africans  <cit> .

linkage disequilibrium implies correlation between loci, which means that information for untyped variants can be inferred from genotyped loci in ld with them. in recent years, ld has been exploited to the extent that it has become the cornerstone concept for research in genetic epidemiology of complex diseases, since it allows indirect association mapping, as implemented in the recent flurry of genomewide association studies  <cit> . it is also the main justification for the hapmap project, in which single nucleotide polymorphisms  were initially validated and genotyped at high density in four human populations  <cit> . the international hapmap project created a genome-wide map of ld and common haplotypes in four populations of african, european and asian ancestry, which has been extended to eleven populations . within each population, sets of reference markers tagging common haplotypes  can be estimated, thus providing a powerful shortcut to carry out ld-based association studies. variation in ld amount and ld patterns across human populations, though, may contribute to the notoriously poor record in replicability of association studies conducted with few snps  <cit> .

it has often been suggested that genetically isolated populations would offer increased statistical power to detect association because of the impact of their particular past demography on their genomic structure  <cit> . ld in isolates would be higher than in other populations because of reduced effective population size, which limits the opportunity for recombination to erode ld. while many populations have been proposed as isolated and ideal for association studies, empirical data that verify the assumptions mentioned above are scarce. some studies using microsatellites in the x chromosome found increased ld in the saami from northern scandinavia  <cit> , which was later confirmed with snps  <cit> . in another study, service et al.  <cit>  compared ld levels in various genetic isolates and with an outbred european-derived sample; against that reference, most but not all isolates showed increased ld. in the latter study, while a very recent isolate created by a few founders, the kuusamo in finland, showed noticeably increased ld, this was not the case for other populations traditionally regarded as isolates such as the azorean  <cit> . the most comprehensive snp-based study of ld and genetic heterogeneity on an isolated population was performed on the micronesian kosrae, where indeed heterogeneity had decreased and ld decayed more slowly with physical distance  <cit> .

here we present data for  <dig>  <dig> snps distributed across  <dig> gene regions in  <dig> worldwide populations representing human diversity . gene regions were selected because they contained one or more genes of interest mostly related to complex disease. we are interested in ld in relation to genetic association studies, in which the redundancy of information implied by ld can be used to optimize genotyping. thus, we generally did not approach ld in the genome, but in and around genes, where most variation related to disease presumably lies. note that larger data sets of worldwide snp variation exist  <cit> , but they consist of snp sets in commercial arrays that were selected because of their tagsnp status in specific populations  <cit>  and, therefore, cannot be used to describe unbiased ld patterns or to detect population differences in ld.

within each gene region and for each population we have quantified the extent of ld between all pairs of snps by means of r <dig>  <cit>  and determined the decay of ld with physical distance. given their potential as efficient tagsnps, we have also tallied the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> larger than  <dig>  in different physical distance classes and the overall per gene region. our gene-centered approach provides an empirical view of the amount and pattern of ld decay with physical distance across worldwide human populations, including some considered as genetic isolates.

RESULTS
the mean r <dig> between all possible snp pairs within each gene region and with minor allele frequencies greater than  <dig>  was computed for each population and continental region and plotted against physical distance . populations included in each continental region are listed in the legend of figure  <dig>  the amount of ld was found to be much smaller in sub-saharan africa than in any other continental region; and, in accordance with their demographic histories, oceania and america displayed greater ld at longer distances. in order to test for the effects of continental region and population affiliation within each continental group on r <dig> variation we performed a nested ancova model . results of the ancova test show that the model and all of its components  are highly significant . the amount of variation explained by the whole model was 14%; physical distance explains most of this ; while the continent and population within continent variables account for the remaining  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. all mean r <dig> pairwise comparisons between continental regions were significant , which means that significance could not be attributed to a single continent. when we compared average ld within continental regions, the proportion of pairwise population comparisons with significant differences  varies greatly among regions. in europe only  <dig> out of  <dig>  pairwise comparisons were significant and all of these six pairs contained the orcadian population. in central south asia, the number of statistically significant comparisons was  <dig> out of  <dig>  corresponding to the brahui and kalash populations. for the remaining continental groups, most comparisons  were significant:  <dig> out of  <dig> pairwise comparisons between sub-saharan african populations,  <dig> out of  <dig> in the middle east – north africa,  <dig> out of  <dig> in east asia, and  <dig> out of  <dig> in the americas. a similar pattern of significance was observed when comparing each continental and populational mean r <dig> value against the mean r <dig> across continents and across populations within each continent, respectively .

the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> greater than  <dig>  was counted for each population and continental region and plotted against physical distance . the average proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  per gene region varied from ~3% in sub-saharan africans to ~17% in americans, which illustrates the differences in ld among continental groups and the different efficiencies of tagging snp strategies across continents. in general, the proportion of snps with r <dig> >  <dig>  was found to be significantly different across continental regions for all physical distance classes . in contrast, comparisons within continents are generally not significant, with a few exceptions. sub-saharan africans  were significantly different  in their proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  for only two distance classes , which were not significant after bonferroni correction. the middle east was significant in the first four distance classes ; this was also the case for seven distance classes in central asia . european populations were heterogeneous for the 10– <dig>  30– <dig>  and 300– <dig> kb distance classes, albeit none of these comparisons would be significant after bonferroni correction. the number of heterogeneous distance classes in east asia was five and two  before and after bonferroni correction, respectively. finally, americans were heterogeneous at all distance bins, and this effect cannot be attributed to any single population: dropping the apparently more differentiated population, the surui, still results in  <dig> significant tests in  <dig> distance bins.

several populations of the hgdp-ceph panel are cultural, linguistic, or demographic isolates . to test whether such isolation has a significant impact in practical terms on ld, we counted the number of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  per gene region. in sub-saharan african populations, we compared the two pygmy samples against the non-isolated mandenka, bantu, and yoruba. in the pygmy samples, the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  per gene region was only slightly lower than in non-pygmies:  <dig> % vs.  <dig> % . in the middle east and north africa the only non-isolated population are the palestinians; however, the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  per gene region was not significantly different between palestinians and the three isolated populations . in the central south asian samples we compared the kalash with all other pakistani populations pooled together. we found significantly higher proportions of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  in the kalash . in europe, after dividing the populations in isolates  vs. non isolates  high-ld snp pairs were  <dig> % in isolates vs.  <dig> % in non-isolates . in east asia, we compared the yakut against all other populations and found a slightly higher increase . finally, in the americas we compared the surui vs. the rest and found the largest difference . in summary, we found that the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  was significantly higher in population isolates as compared to non-isolates in some but not all continental regions. moreover, when analyzing the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  by physical distance classes between isolated and non-isolated populations within each continent, only the kalash and the surui displayed statistically significant larger proportions consistently for several distance bins after bonferroni correction. it may be argued that removing snps with maf <  <dig>  populationwise would bias the results by dropping more snps in isolated populations; however, the proportion of polymorphic snps removed in african isolates  was just slightly higher than in non-isolates , as was also the case in east asia , while in europe, the middle east/north africa, and central south asia, the difference was negligible .

discussion
the amount of ld and the proportion of snps with r <dig> >  <dig>  showed similar patterns: heterogeneity among continental regions and higher homogeneity among populations within each geographical region, with the exception of the americas. although correlated, these two measures of overall ld capture different aspects: mean r <dig> offers a broad picture of ld, while the proportion of r <dig> values >  <dig>  focuses on the higher end of the ld spectrum, where information redundancy between snps is higher to the point that it is the usual threshold where tagsnps are designed. we have confirmed the previously observed trend of an ld decline from sub-saharan africa  to successively increasing amounts of ld in middle east-north africa, central south asia, europe, east asia, oceania and america   <cit> . previous observations were based either on a few genes and a similar geographical range of samples  <cit>  or, on the contrary, on a higher number of markers limited to a small number of populations, such as the three hapmap or perlegen populations  <cit> . a basic description of ld decline with distance has been published for a subset of the hgdp-ceph panel for >  <dig>  <dig> snps  <cit> , outlining the general trends that we have analyzed in detail. we have explored the ld patterns in  <dig> worldwide populations by means of the r <dig> measure of ld between  <dig>  <dig> snps pairs covering  <dig> autosomal gene regions. moreover, we have specifically focused on those snp pairs with high ld  in a relevant subset of genes, as most of them may be implicated in common diseases. note that our results may not be applied to the whole genome, but they are highly relevant to candidate-gene association studies. in this context, we have extended the previous observation that more tagsnps are needed in the yoruba than in europeans or asians  <cit>  to a wider range of african populations that show similarly low levels of ld. on average,  <dig> % of the snp pairs in our study showed r <dig> >  <dig>  in sub-saharan africans vs.  <dig> % in europeans; that is,  <dig>  times as many snp pairs showed high levels of information redundancy in europeans than in africans. we found a general pattern of greater ld differences between continents than within them, which would imply that genetic association studies should be more easily replicated within than between continents, as previously indicated in a set of dopamine and serotonin pathway genes  <cit> . similarly, our results point to a high transferability of tagsnps within continents  <cit> , with the exception of america. this pattern reflects the extremely heterogeneous nature of the american populations as reflected, for instance, in their str allele frequencies  <cit> . apparently, after the bottleneck associated with the first colonization of the americas, which increased ld, genetic drift has acted extensively to differentiate american populations in their allele and haplotype frequencies as well as in their levels of ld.

a role has been suggested for genetically isolated populations in genetic epidemiology because of their predicted high levels of ld, which would facilitate the detection of genes involved in complex diseases by indirect association  <cit> . in the hgdp-ceph panel, several populations can be considered as cultural and genetic isolates . such populations showed moderate increases in the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> >  <dig>  per gene region when compared with the non-isolates in their respective continents. conversely, if we take the proportion of snp pairs with r <dig> <  <dig>  as a rough indication of the minimum proportion of snps that are needed to capture the haplotype variation in a gene region, then the difference in the number of the snps that need to be typed in isolated populations compared to their non-isolate continental counterparts would be of  <dig> % in the european isolates,  <dig> % in the yakut,  <dig> % in the kalash, and  <dig> % in the surui. thus, genotyping costs may be slightly more economical in isolated than in outbred populations. however, association studies designed in the latter may have two practical advantatges: i) possibly larger sample sizes can be obtained in general populations, and ii) allele frequencies may be closer to those in reference hapmap populations, which allows more precise a priori statistical power calculations and prevents genotyping snps that can result monomorphic.

it follows, then, that being labelled a population isolate by genetic, linguistic or cultural evidence is not sufficient to harbor increased ld to a point that would justify a significant reprieve in the genotyping burden for genetic association studies. this result agrees with a separate analysis  <cit>  in the ceph-hgdp panel, in which the microsatellite-based estimates of the θ = 4neμ paramater were not significantly lower in isolated than in mainstream populations within each continent. considering mutation rates  as equal across populations, it follows that effective population sizes are not detectably lower in population isolates. a presumably reduced effective population size is indeed the condition that would increase ld in isolated populations. the levels of isolation required to decrease ne significantly and subsequently increase ld appear to have been rare in the human demographic history, at least in the populations sampled for the ceph-hgdp panel. examples of isolated populations with significantly increased ld are the kuusamo finns  <cit>  and the micronesian kosrae  <cit> ; in the ceph-hgdp panel, the only isolated populations with consistently increased ld in all distance classes with respect to their continent are the kalash  and the surui . the kalash were noticed as an outlier for their allele frequencies in  <dig> strs  <cit> , although a more recent survey of  <dig>  <dig> snps failed to replicate this finding  <cit> ; the surui, even though all presumed related individuals have been dropped from the analysis, may share many recent common ancestors  <cit> .

the present study was designed to mimic the conditions under which most genomewide association studies are performed, namely: i) focus on gene regions; ii) common snps, usually defined through a maf threshold in a reference population, and iii) use of tagsnps, often defined with a r <dig> >  <dig>  threshold. we have shown that, under these conditions, the snps that would be needed to be typed are just slightly less in isolates. it is increasingly being recognized, and we provide empirical results to that effect, that the value of isolated populations in genetic epidemiology lies not in their higher ld brought about by a presumably reduced ne, but due to other characteristics such as large and accessible families, deep genealogical records or a low environmental variance.

CONCLUSIONS
we have explored both the levels and decay of ld with physical distance along  <dig> gene regions mostly related to complex disease across  <dig> worldwide human populations. when focusing on the populations considered to be isolates, the main result of our gene-centered approach is that these isolates do not usually show increased levels of ld as measured by the proportion of snps with r <dig> greater than  <dig> . these results led us to conclude that the "isolated population" label by itself does not guarantee a greater genotyping efficiency in association studies, and that properties other than increased ld may make these populations interesting in genetic epidemiology.
