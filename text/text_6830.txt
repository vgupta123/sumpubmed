BACKGROUND
powdery mildew  is a major fungal disease for thousands of plant species  <cit> , including cultivated rosaceae such as apple , apricot , peach , and strawberry . powdery mildew occurs in all major growing regions of rosaceous crops, leading to severe losses  <cit> 
. the major pm causal agents are podosphaera leucotricha in apple  <cit> , sphaerotheca pannosa var. persicae in peach  <cit> , podosphaera tridactyla in apricot  <cit>  and podosphaera aphanis  in strawberry  <cit> . powdery mildew shows similar symptoms in the four species: white spots appear on young green tissues, particularly leaves in the first days after opening, whereas mature leaves show some resistance. infected leaves crinkle, curl, and prematurely drop. blossoms and fruits are not the primary targets of pm fungi, but infections of these tissues are possible  <cit> . in peach, apricot and apple, pm spores overwinter in buds and then in spring, with the reprise of vegetative growth, the spores start a new infection  <cit> .

cultivars resistant to pm are fundamental in order to reduce the use of pesticides in agricultural practices. the usual strategy in breeding focuses on dominant plant resistance genes , however these genes often originate from wild-relatives of the cultivated species, and thus interspecific crossability barriers could prevent their introgression  <cit> . moreover, in case of a successful cross, several undesirable traits are incorporated with the r-gene, making extensive backcrossing necessary, which is time-consuming in woody species. finally, the durability of r-genes is generally limited due to the appearance of virulent strains of the pathogen, which can overcome resistance in a few years  <cit> . two examples are venturia inaequalis race  <dig>  which is able to overcome rvi <dig> resistance to scab in apple  <cit> , and p. leucotricha strains able to breakdown pl- <dig> and pl- <dig>  two major pm r-genes of apple  <cit> .

an alternative to the use of r-genes is based on plant susceptibility genes , defined as genes whose loss-of-function results in recessively inherited resistance  <cit> . barley mlo pm resistance, first characterized in  <dig>  is a remarkable example of immunity due to the absence of an s-gene, as it derives from a loss-of-function mutation in the mlo  gene, encoding for a protein with seven transmembrane domains  <cit> . mlo resistance has long been considered as a unique form of immunity, characterized by durability, broad-spectrum effectiveness and recessive inheritance  <cit> . however, the characterization of the sources of resistance in other plant species, such as arabidopsis
 <cit> , pea  <cit>  and tomato  <cit> , has revealed that resistance resulting from loss-of-function mutations in mlo functional orthologs is more common than previously thought. therefore, it has been suggested that the inactivation of mlo susceptibility genes could represent a valid strategy to introduce pm resistance across a broad range of cultivated species  <cit> .

histological characterization of mlo resistance revealed that it is based on a pre-penetration defense system, associated with the formation of cell-wall appositions  <cit>  and at least partially dependent on the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . it has been suggested that functional mlo proteins negatively regulate vesicle-associated and actin-dependent defense pathways at the site of attempted pm penetration  <cit> . mlo proteins are therefore targeted by pm fungi as a strategy to induce pathogenesis. the early stages of pm infection are associated with an increase in transcript abundance of mlo susceptibility genes, showing a peak at six hours after inoculation. this has been shown to occur in tomato  <cit> , barley  <cit> , pepper  <cit>  and grape  <cit> .

mlo susceptibility genes are members of a gene family which shows tissue specific expression patterns and are involved in a variety of physiological processes, besides the response to pm fungi: one of the  <dig> mlo genes of arabidopsis, atmlo <dig>  is involved in pollen tube reception by the embryo sac and its mutation results in reduced fertility  <cit> . two other arabidopsis genes, named atmlo <dig> and atmlo <dig>  are involved in the control of root architecture, as mutants with null alleles of these two genes display asymmetrical root growth and exaggerated curvature  <cit> .

previous phylogenetic analysis of the mlo protein family identified six clades  <cit> . currently, all mlo proteins functionally related to pm susceptibility in dicot species appear in a single clade, namely clade v  <cit> . similarly, clade iv harbours all characterized pm susceptibility proteins from monocots  <cit> .

mlo genes have been intensively studied in many monocots and dicots, but very little has been performed in rosaceae. in this investigation, we characterized the mlo gene family in a number of rosaceous species, with respect to their structural, genomic and evolutionary features. moreover, we monitored the transcript abundances of apple mlo homologs following p. leucotricha inoculation in three apple cultivars.

RESULTS
in silicoand in vitrocharacterization of rosaceae mlohomologs
a database search for rosaceae mlo homologs produced  <dig> significant matches in peach,  <dig> in strawberry and  <dig> in apple. of these, six  showed a very limited alignment region with other mlo genes, whereas eight  were characterized by markedly different length with respect to mlo homologs reported in the genomes of arabidopsis and grapevine  <cit> , i.e. less than  <dig> amino acids  or more than  <dig> aa. details on genomic localization amino acid number, putative transmembrane domains and predicted exon/intron structure of the remaining homologs, together with information about the mlo homologs nomenclature chosen in this study is provided in tablesÂ  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> table  <dig>

peach and apricot are evolutionary very close to each other, and show a high degree of homology in dna sequence. phylogenetic analysis  indicated peach homologs ppmlo <dig>  ppmlo <dig> and ppmlo <dig> as candidates for being required for pm susceptibility. therefore, we used the sequences of these genes to design primers to identify full-length apricot mlo genes. this approach resulted in the amplification and the successive characterization of three mlo sequences, which were by analogy named pamlo <dig>  pamlo <dig>  and pamlo <dig> .

phylogenetic relations and inference of orthology
we performed a phylogenetic study on the newly identified rosaceae mlo proteins. the dataset was completed with four homologs recently characterized in rosa hybrida   <cit>  , the complete arabidopsis thaliana atmlo protein family  <cit> , a series of mlo homologs which have been functionally associated with pm susceptibility, namely tomato  slmlo <dig>  <cit> , pea  psmlo <dig>  <cit> , pepper  camlo <dig>  <cit> , lotus  ljmlo <dig>  <cit> , barrel clover  mtmlo <dig>  <cit> , barley  hvmlo  <cit> , rice  osmlo <dig>  <cit> , wheat  tamlo_b <dig> and tamlo_a1b  <cit> , and grapevine  vvmlo <dig>  the only dicot mlo homolog known to belong to clade iv  <cit> . clustering analysis using the upgma algorithm resulted in a total of eight distinct clades and no divergent lineage . clade numbers from i to vi were assigned based on the position of arabidopsis atmlo homologs and barley hvmlo, according to the previous study of feechan et al.
 <cit> . the two additional clades  were found to include rosaceae mlo homologs only, both having one homolog from p. persica, one from f. vesca and one from m. domestica. further clustering analysis with a neighbour-joining algorithm resulted in merging clade vii and viii .figure  <dig>

four apple mlo homologs  and three mlo homologs from peach , apricot  and woodland strawberrry  were found to cluster together in the phylogenetic clade v, containing all the dicot mlo proteins experimentally shown to be required for pm susceptibility  and one from peach  were found to group, together with grapevine vvmlo <dig>  in clade iv, which contains all monocot mlo proteins acting as pm susceptibility factors .

we used the gbrowse-syn tool to detect syntenic blocks encompassing p. persica, f. vesca and m. domestica mlo genes. as syntenic blocks derive from the evolution of the same chromosomal region after speciation, orthology between mlo genes could be inferred. in total, twelve orthologous relationships were predicted between p. persica and f. vesca, nine between p. persica and m. domestica and eight between f. vesca and m. domestica .table  <dig>

transcription of putative apple mlogenes in response to podosphaera leucotrichainoculation
to identify mlo genes that respond to the pm fungus p. leucotricha, we measured the transcript abundance of  <dig> out of  <dig> apple mlo genes in leaves  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 24Â hours after artificial inoculation with the pathogen, and compared these data with the ones of non-inoculated leaves. three cultivars, golden delicious, braeburn and gala, were analysed in order to investigate whether up-regulation was comparable among them and results could therefore be generalized for all apple cultivars. three genes, namely mdmlo <dig>  mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  were found to be significantly up-regulated after inoculation with the pathogen . up-regulation of these genes was about 2-fold compared to non-inoculated plants, with peaks of 4-fold up-regulation at very early time points . mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig> were up-regulated in all cultivars, while mdmlo <dig> was only up-regulated in âbraeburnâ and âgolden deliciousâ.figure  <dig>

two of the genes, mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig> belong to clade v, while mdmlo <dig> belongs to the newly identified clade vii .

discussion
genomic organization and phylogenetic relations between rosaceae mlohomologs
we report here the identification, through an in silico approach, of  <dig> mlo homologs in the genome of peach and  <dig> in the genome of strawberry. this is consistent with the results of previous genome-wide studies carried out on dicotyledonous species, indicating the presence of  <dig> mlo homologs in arabidopsis,  <dig> in grapevine and  <dig> in tomato  <cit> ; appiano et al., unpublished results;  <cit> . conversely, the number of mlo homologs detected in apple  is lower than expected, considering that a relatively recent genome-wide duplication event has occurred in the pyreae tribe  <cit> .

most ppmlo, fvmlo and mdmlo homologs appeared to be widely distributed within the respective genomes , indicating segmental duplication as the prevailing evolutionary mechanism for the rosaceae mlo gene family. however, we also found cases of clusters of adjacent homologs , which are likely the result of tandem duplication events.

inference of phylogenetic relationships between mlo proteins revealed the presence of apple, strawberry, peach and apricot homologs in the clade v, containing all dicot mlo homologs shown so far to be involved in pm susceptibility, thus making them candidates to act as susceptibility factors. although the simple clustering in clade v is not enough to recognize a gene as a susceptibility factor, it does provide the first evidence for functionality and allows for the reduction in the number of candidates for further functional analysis. clade iv, that contains functional mlo susceptibility homologs from monocots, was found to include one homolog from f. vesca  and one from p. persica . in accordance with this finding, a mlo homolog from the dicot species v. vinifera also clusters in clade iv  <cit> . figureÂ 1). interestingly, phylogenetic analyses carried out in this study also revealed the presence of one or two additional clades, depending on the type of phylogenetic reconstruction , which were not reported to occur in earlier investigations. moreover, they appear to be characteristic of rosaceae, since they contain only homologs from this family. clearly, the exclusivity for rosaceae of these clade needs to be confirmed by further studies containing a larger dataset of mlo proteins. additional studies could be also addressed to the functional characterization of rosaceae mlo homologs grouped in clade vii. indeed, this appears to be basal to both clade iv and clade v , and thus might have contained ancestral proteins which later on evolved into pm susceptibility factors.

synteny between apple, peach and woodland strawberry mlogenes
we took advantage of recent developments in rosaceae genomics in order to detect synteny between p. persica, f. vesca and m. domestica chromosomal regions containing mlo homologs. this permitted the inference of ortholgous relationships between mlo genes in these species. notably, all predicted mlo orthologs from different rosaceae species, fell in the same phylogenetic clade . this is to be expected, since orthologs generally share the same function and thus are characterized by a high level of sequence conservation. it is noteworthy that the chromosomal localization of predicted mlo orthologs between p. persica, m. domestica and f. vesca is in accordance with the results of the synteny study performed after the release of the three genomes  <cit> . in particular, genes situated on peach scaffold  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were predicted to have orthologs on strawberry chromosome  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, whereas genes on peach scaffold  <dig> were predicted to have orthologs on strawberry chromosomes  <dig> or  <dig> . fvmlo <dig> was predicted to be orthologous to two peach mlo genes, ppmlo <dig> and ppmlo <dig>  which are localised in close proximity to each other on peach scaffold  <dig> and grouped together in clade vi. in this case, we hypothesize a relation of co-orthology due to the occurrence of a recent tandem duplication event in the peach genome. similarly, ppmlo <dig> and fvmlo <dig> were predicted to be orthologs of two apple mlo genes, mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  this is consistent with indications of duplications of large segments of these two chromosomes during the evolution of the apple genome  <cit> .

transcription of apple putative mlogenes in response to p. leucotrichainoculation
in barley, pea and tomato, only one of the clade v mlo homologs seems to be involved in powdery mildew susceptibility, whereas in a. thaliana three mlo genes in clade v are required to be inactivated in order to achieve a fully resistant phenotype  <cit> . this implies that, within clade v mlo genes, a further selection might be required to identify pm susceptibility genes. accumulating evidence indicates that mlo susceptibility genes are up-regulated upon challenge with powdery mildew fungi  <cit> . therefore, we analysed the expression level of apple mlo genes identified in this study in response to the interaction with p. leucotricha. three pathogen-dependent gene up-regulations were detected. two up-regulated mlo homologs, mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  encode for proteins falling in clade v, thus making them likely candidates to act as pm susceptibility genes in apple. mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig> are located on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and are therefore both generated from a duplication event in the 9-chromosome ancestor of apple  <cit> . a third pathogen-dependent up-regulated gene, mdmlo <dig>  was found, which encodes a protein grouping in the newly identified clade vii . the presence of a pm upregulated gene outside clade v is consistent with transcriptome analyses recently performed in tomato . apple clade v also contains two genes, mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  which show no significant changes in expression following inoculation. accordingly, the lack of up-regulation of some clade v mlo genes has been observed in grapevine and tomato  <cit> ; appiano et al., unpublished results). the possible role of these genes as susceptibility factors has not yet been highlighted.

ppmlo <dig>  pamlo <dig> and fvmlo <dig> are likely to represent true orthologs of mdmlo <dig> . since orthologs often maintain the same function during evolution, we conjecture that the expression of these genes might also be responsive to pm fungi attacking corresponding species. moreover, fvmlo <dig> and ppmlo <dig> are likely orthologs of mdmlo <dig>  so they should also be considered as putative transcriptionally responsive genes to pm fungi attack. further studies aimed at the functional characterization of these genes , in apple but also in peach and strawberry, might lead to the identification of resistant phenotypes, which could be used for the development of pm resistant cultivars. particularly, studies on mdmlo <dig> could lead to the characterization of a possible role for clade vii in the interaction with pm fungi.

CONCLUSIONS
our work led to the identification of  <dig> mlo homologs in peach,  <dig> in strawberry and  <dig> in apple. three, three and four homologs, respectively, belong to clade v and therefore are candidates for being s-genes. due to the high similarity between peach and apricot, we were able to amplify and characterize three clade v apricot mlo genes.

the phylogenetic analysis revealed two new rosaceae specific clades for the mlo family, although this needs to be confirmed by the use of a larger mlo proteins dataset.

through inoculation of apple with p. leucotrica, we identified three up-regulated genes, i.e. mdmlo <dig>  mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  mdmlo <dig> and mdmlo <dig>  that belong to clade v, are positioned in duplicated regions and have high sequence identity, therefore they are likely to be recent paralogs. mdmlo <dig> belongs to the newly identified clade vii.
