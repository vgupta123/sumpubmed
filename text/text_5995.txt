BACKGROUND
cells in complex multicellular organisms acquire their structural and functional attributes by differentiation, a genetic program specific for a given environment of the cells. in many higher organisms, differentiation is a unidirectional and irreversible process. in higher plants, however, most differentiated cells are able to transdifferentiate, i.e. start a new differentiation pathway. somatic embryogenesis  may be considered as the ultimate form of this plant cell totipotency in that fully differentiated somatic cells are induced to regenerate new plants via a developmental pathway that resembles zygotic embryogenesis  <cit> . despite considerable efforts, the processes underlying the transition from a somatic to embryogenic cell, i.e. induction, dedifferentiation, and redifferentiation, are still poorly understood  <cit> .

for twenty years, processes related to the induction of se in chicory are being studied in our laboratory at the cytological, physiological, and molecular level using the interspecific hybrid '474' . in contrast to many agronomical important varieties of chicory, somatic embryos are readily and rapidly formed in large numbers in different explants from the hybrid '474' when cultured under constant agitation in the dark at 35Â°c in a murashige and skoog culture medium containing low concentrations of auxin and cytokinin  <cit> . se is direct under these conditions, i.e. without the development of a callus, and embryos are formed from single cells  <cit> .

using the chicory hybrid '474' se model system, different methods have been applied to clone genes that might be involved in the early phases of se, or that at least could serve as markers of se induction. the genes corresponding to the cloned cdnas were differentially expressed in explants of the hybrid '474' during se and not or only weakly expressed in explants of non-embryogenic c. intybus l. varieties cultured under the same conditions, suggesting that the expression of these genes was related to se and not to the stress due to the culture conditions  <cit> . however, determination of causal relationships between the differentially expressed genes and se is hampered due to the interspecific status of hybrid '474', and its complete sterility.

more recently, genetic variability with respect to the formation of somatic embryos was found present in a hungarian landrace of c. intybus l., called 'koospol', from which also the c. intybus l. parent of the hybrid '474' originated . upon screening plants from this landrace, embryogenic and non-embryogenic genotypes were identified, offering the possibility to introduce genetics as a tool to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of se in chicory. the plant k <dig> was selected as a highly embryogenic  genotype, and a few seeds were obtained after repeated selfing of this normally self-incompatible, and highly heterozygous, genotype. amongst the plants grown from these seeds, the plant c <dig> was found to represent a non-embryogenic  genotype, incapable of forming somatic embryos under our se-inducing conditions. sharing a similar genetic background, the genotypes k <dig> and its descendant c <dig> thus seemed an obvious choice as starting material for detailed analysis of differential gene expression during the early stages of se in chicory.

in this study, we report the generation of an embryogenic  and a non-embryogenic  cdna library by applying suppression subtractive hybridization   <cit>  using mrnas isolated from leaf explants of genotypes k <dig> and c <dig>  cultured for  <dig> days under se-inducing conditions. from the libraries  <dig>  cdna-clones were selected, sequenced, and subjected to database searches to annotate the putative functions of the representing genes. differentially expressed genes were identified by in silico subtraction analysis and real-time rt-pcr. several genes preferentially expressed in k <dig> seem to encode proteins involved in protein synthesis and cell division, whereas proteins encoded by genes preferentially expressed in c <dig> may be involved in defence. the results are discussed with respect to the quality of the libraries, and their use for future research on differential gene expression during se in chicory.

RESULTS
cellular events during the induction of somatic embryogenesis in k <dig> and c15
when leaf explants from the genotypes k <dig> and c <dig> were cultivated under se-inducing conditions as developed for the hybrid '474'  <cit> , somatic embryos were formed in the explants from k <dig>  but not in those from c <dig> . following the cellular events in explants from both genotypes during se culture by microscopic examination of semi-thin sections, revealed that se development in k <dig> was similar as described previously for the hybrid '474'  <cit> . the first visible response in the explants, starting after one day of culture, was cell reactivation; reactivating cells being characterized by enlarged nuclei and clearly distinguishable nucleoli. at this stage the nucleus is still oppressed against the cell wall, situated between the plasmalemma and the tonoplast of the central vacuole, and is surrounded by chloroplasts. one day later, the first reactivated cells with their nuclei positioned in the middle of the cell and surrounded by a fragmented vacuole, were observed. at day  <dig> of se culture, in explants of k <dig> reactivating and reactivated cells were observed, as well as some first cell divisions preceding somatic embryo formation . in contrast, in explants from c <dig> only cells that seemed to have started reactivation were observed , albeit in lower numbers as compared to k <dig>  observations at day  <dig> of the culture showed the presence of many proembryos in the explants of k <dig> , whereas in the explants from c <dig> there was still no development of reactivated or dividing cells . from these results it was concluded that differences in mrna levels in explants from k <dig> and c <dig> collected at day  <dig> of se culture are likely to reflect differential gene expression related to processes accompanying the early stages of se in k <dig> 

generation of ssh from an embryogenic and a non-embryogenic genotype
messenger rnas isolated from leaf explants of k <dig> and c <dig>  collected at day  <dig> of culture under se inducing conditions, were used to construct two subtractive cdna-libraries by applying ssh. the e library, a library supposed to be enriched in cdnas representing genes preferentially expressed during se, was obtained by using cdnas from k <dig> mrnas as 'tester' and cdnas from c <dig> mrnas as 'driver'. the ne library was obtained by reversing 'tester' and 'driver' mrna.

sequencing was carried out for about  <dig>  cdnas clones randomly selected from both libraries:  <dig>  from the e library and  <dig>  from the ne library. after removing bad quality sequences, a total of  <dig>  ests from the e library and  <dig>  from the ne library were conserved for further analyses. the average length of the  <dig>  ests was  <dig> bp, and the gc content was equal to 45% .

a database named e/ne db was generated from all ests from the e and ne library. to generate ocs  two successive criteria were applied. first, all  <dig>  sequences from the e/ne db were submitted to a blastn search  against this database. the sorted sequences were grouped in  <dig>  primary ocs . next, sequences in primary ocs containing more than one est were aligned and their mutual sequence identity determined. ocs containing ests that all shared at least 95% identity over a contiguous sequence of  <dig> bp retained their primary code. ocs that contained two or more groups of ests by this criterion were split in  <dig> or more ocs, respectively, each identified by the primary code followed by a letter . this analysis revealed a total of  <dig>  ocs, of which  <dig>  were singletons, and  <dig> contained between  <dig> and  <dig> ests.

contig/oc: contig or oc  number. putative functions were determined by a blastx search  against the non redundant genbank database. e and ne: number of ests from the e and the ne library, respectively; p: probability related to the in silico prediction calculated according to audic and claverie  <cit> . pred  indicates in which genotype  the gene was found preferentially expressed. er: expression ratios  between the embryogenic and the non-embryogenic genotype at day  <dig> of se culture estimated by real-time rt-pcr. er <dig> and er <dig> designate the expression ratios obtained from  <dig> independent first strand cdna synthesis reactions . the asterisk indicates genes that were found to be differentially expressed according the thresholds applied .

comparison of chicory ests with sequences of other species allowing the formation of contigs
direct determination of the number of genes represented by the  <dig>  ocs identified was not possible since the digestion of cdna with rsai during the ssh procedure left no overlapping sequences, and thus prevented the construction of contigs. to identify ocs that potentially represented the same gene, sequential blastn searches  were performed against assembled ests from lettuce , sunflower , and zinnia elegans l.  . the hierarchy of the searches was determined by the botanical proximity of the species; chicory and lettuce belonging to the tribe lactuaceae of the subfamily cichorioideae of the asteraceae, whereas sunflower and z. elegans belong to the subfamily asteroideae  <cit> . in parallel, blastx searches were performed using the non-redundant  genebank database  <cit> , and the arabidopsis translated coding sequences  <cit> .

*the  <dig> ests of chicory were sequentially submitted to blastn searches against assembled ests from lettuce, sunflower and zinnia.

the results of the blastn searches in the asteraceae databases showed a high proportion of 'no hits found', i.e.  <dig> ests of chicory  were not represented in asteraceae databases. in comparison, only 13â17% of the chicory ests did not match to any sequence in the arabidopsis and genebank nr databases . furthermore, the results quite often suggested that ocs that were clearly distinguished by our oc-criteria, as well as by the results of the blastx searches, matched to the same asteraceae contig. taken together, this clearly indicated that the cgpd and pgdb databases were not yet sufficiently exhaustive to represent the asteraceae transcriptomes.

it was therefore decided to use the results of the blastx searches to assemble the chicory ocs into contigs. in a first attempt, ocs and singletons with the same best hit  in the atgdb were considered to represent the same gene. however, ests grouped in different oc, because they had less than 95% sequence identity, were sometimes found to match with the same arabidopsis coding sequence. in these cases very often each oc matched with a different sequence in the nr genebank database . this may be indicative for a higher number of duplicated genes in chicory than in arabidopsis. these analyses led to the formation of  <dig> contigs by the regrouping of  <dig> ocs with at least  <dig> ests, and  <dig> singletons. together with the remaining  <dig>  ocs, we estimated that the  <dig>  ests selected from the e and ne library represent at maximum  <dig>  genes . from these  <dig>  annotated genes,  <dig>  genes  were composed of ests exclusively originating from the e library,  <dig> genes  of ests exclusively originating from the ne library, and  <dig> genes  of ests present in both libraries.

the total number of genes is probably overestimated, since part of the ocs and contigs containing ests without significant matches may correspond to genes already accounted for, because they represent untranslated mrna regions. if we consider ocs composed of non-matching ests to be part of genes already accounted for, and when we omit the criterion of 95% identity over a contiguous sequence of  <dig> bp to divine an oc, a minimum of  <dig>  genes was obtained.

annotation and functional classification of ests
annotation of the ests using blastx searches against sequences in nr genebank database, revealed that 55% of the ests had a high similarity with the best match , and 32% a moderate similarity . the 13% remaining with an e-value â¥ e- <dig>  or with no match found, was classified as 'no hits found'. the lack of sequence homology may be related to the average length of  <dig> bp for these ests, about  <dig> bp less than the average sequence length of  <dig> bp for annotated ests   <cit> .

the distribution of the putative functions of the annotated genes was similar for both libraries , the major classes being 'function unknown'  , 'metabolism' , 'protein synthesis' , 'cellular transport, transport facilitation and transport routes' , 'protein fate'  and 'cell rescue, defence and virulence' .

from the  <dig> ests representing genes related to protein synthesis,  <dig>  represent genes encoding ribosomal proteins:  <dig> and  <dig> ests from the e and the ne library, respectively. in comparison, only  <dig> % of  <dig>  ests for arabidopsis were found to represent genes encoding ribosomal proteins  <cit> .

the most represented genes in our libraries are a metallothionein  with  <dig> ests  of the  <dig> ones related to 'cell rescue, defence and virulence' and a gene encoding a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a reductase  related to 'metabolism' and represented by  <dig> ests in the e library and  <dig> in the ne library.

the distributions of the putative functions of the annotated genes, except for those encoding ribosomal proteins, resembled those reported for genes or cdnas in arabidopsis and other plant species  <cit> , including the about 25% sequences with undetermined functions. apparently the ssh procedure had not effected an enrichment of ests representing genes implemented in particular functions in one of the genotypes, at least not at this level of functional assignment.

in silico screening and real time rt-pcr
the large proportion of the annotated genes represented by single ests   seems to indicate an efficient normalisation of the libraries; only 3% of the genes were represented by more than  <dig> ests. furthermore, only 14% of the annotated genes in the different functional groups were represented by ests from both libraries , as could be expected for an ad random selection of the ests from libraries that were effectively normalised.

to verify further the efficiency of the normalisation realised by the ssh procedure, we performed an in silico subtraction, or 'digital northern', on all the ests from our libraries. this analysis is based on the relation between the abundance of ests in a cdna library and the differential expression of the corresponding genes  <cit> , and is ordinarily performed on ests in cdna libraries that are not normalized  <cit> . inversely, applying this analysis may provide a measure for the normalisation achieved, and as normalization is nearly always imperfect, in particular for very abundant transcripts  <cit> , it may also reveal ests representing genes preferentially expressed in the e or ne genotype.

using the significance test of audic and claverie  <cit> , it was found that from the  <dig>  annotated genes, only  <dig>  were expected to be differentially expressed;  <dig> genes preferentially expressed in the e genotype, and  <dig> in the ne genotype . for  <dig> of the  <dig> predicted genes the abundance of transcripts was measured by real-time rt-pcr . the results confirmed the differentially expression of  <dig> genes, i.e.  <dig> preferentially expressed in explants from the e genotype, and  <dig> in explants from the ne genotype. for  <dig> genes that were predicted to be preferentially expressed in the ne genotype, it was found that they were actually preferentially expressed in the e genotype. the remaining  <dig> genes were found to be not differentially expressed.

the relative low number of differentially expressed genes predicted by in silico subtraction suggested a high efficiency of the normalisation realised by ssh. it was reported that normalisation and enrichment by ssh is ineffective for abundant transcripts in tester or driver samples  <cit> , leading to an elevated number of background clones. indeed, the real-time rt-pcr experiments showed that in comparison to the level of transcripts for actin- <dig>  transcripts of some genes were abundant  in explants of both k <dig> and c <dig>  where as for other genes the level of transcripts was considerably lower  than for actin- <dig> . these results indicated that there was no relation between transcript level and est representation in the libraries.

for another set of  <dig> genes, some of them selected because they have been reported to play key roles during early stages of somatic embryogenesis or during plant development , others because they were represented by several ests in the libraries , the abundance of transcripts was also measured by real-time rt-pcr . this led to the identification of an additional  <dig> differentially expressed genes;  <dig> in the e genotype, and  <dig> in the ne genotype .

discussion
an e and a ne cdna-library were generated by ssh using mrnas isolated from leaf explants from two chicory genotypes differing in se capacity cultured for  <dig> days under se-inducing conditions, and a total of  <dig>  ests from both libraries turned out to represent a maximum of  <dig>  genes. real time rt-pcr analyses of the expression of  <dig> annotated genes revealed that after  <dig> days of culture under se-inducing conditions,  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in the e genotype, and  <dig> genes in the ne genotype . this indicated that the e and ne library contain ests representing genes differentially expressed in k <dig> or c <dig>  even though ests found present in one library not necessarily represented a gene exclusively expressed in the corresponding genotype. in addition, some of the differences in gene expression between the two lines might be the result of genetic differences that have nothing to do with se capacity. as we intend to use ests from both libraries for future studies on gene expression during se, the most important contribution of ssh in the construction of the libraries was probably the normalisation achieved, heightening the possibility to find ests representing feebly expressed genes.

we chose to construct the e and ne library using mrnas isolated from explants of k <dig> and c <dig> cultured for  <dig> days under se conditions on the basis of cytological observations, in particular the occurrence of the first cell divisions in explants of k <dig>  seven genes encoding ribosomal proteins were tested by real-time rt-pcr, and were all found to be preferentially expressed in explants of k <dig>  the embryogenic genotype . this probably reflects ribosome biogenesis required for the preparation of cells in the explants to enter the se transdifferentiation pathway, and in particular to reinitiate cell divisions. the relation between augmented expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and cell divisions has been documented in several studies . in z. elegans, many genes encoding ribosomal proteins were found to be preferentially expressed during the transdifferentiation of mesophyll cells into xylem cells  <cit> , and in aspen relative high numbers of ests representing ribosomal protein genes were reported for cdna libraries from meristematic tissues  <cit> . in addition to the ribosomal protein-encoding genes, preferential expression in k <dig> was detected for  <dig> genes implicated in cell cycling: a gene encoding a cdc48-like protein   <cit>  and a g protein beta subunit-like protein   <cit>  .

the above results indicated that the preferential expression of genes implicated in cell division in k <dig> concurs with the cytological observations. cells in the explants of k <dig> that enter the cell division cycle have lost their original identity, and most of them seem to enter the se pathway thereafter. a gene  encoding a protein having a high homology with the protein argonaute  <dig>  was found to be expressed preferentially in the explants of k <dig> at day  <dig> of se culture. in arabidopsis, ago <dig> mutants present loss of stem cell maintenance and failure of axillary meristem formation  <cit> , and it was shown that ago <dig>  together with zwille/pinhead, regulates stem cell maintenance via shoot meristemless   <cit> . a gene homologous to stm has been identified in chicory and was shown to be differentially expressed early during se . furthermore,  <dig> ests from the e library  were found to represent a gene homologous to zwille/pinhead in arabidopsis. the early expression during se of genes regulating stem cell maintenance may indicate that they also play a role in the transdifferentiation process accompanying se .

another interesting result may be the preferentially expression in k <dig> of a gene  putatively encoding an arabinogalactan protein  similar to dcagp <dig> from carrot. dcagp <dig> encodes a non-classical agp with strong similarity to a family of basic proline-rich proteins  <cit> . agps are supposed to be involved in many signaling pathways  <cit> , and were reported to be essential for the formation of somatic embryos in chicory  <cit> .

the cytological studies indicated that in c <dig> cells reacted differently to the se-inducing culture conditions, possibly by failing to progress in cell reactivation . the differences in gene expression between c <dig> and k <dig> observed at day  <dig> of se culture suggests that in contrast to the opportunistic response as observed for k <dig>  cells in the explants from c <dig> reacted to the stresses applied by a defensive response. this was illustrated by the preferential expression in c <dig> of genes involved in the ethylene signalling pathway: two genes encode acc oxidases , and a gene encodes an ethylene response element binding protein . some other genes preferentially expressed in c <dig>  also related to defence, encode a metallothionein , a glutathione transferase , and a leaf senescence-related protein   <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the e and ne cdna libraries described in this paper will be important new tools in our ongoing efforts to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of direct somatic embryogenesis in chicory. none of the genes identified in this study has been identified as such previously in our laboratory  <cit> . this is probably due to the limited number of clones from our libraries that were sequenced, to the differences in the timing and way of selection, and/or differences between the e and ne genotypes used for screening. the results of the real-time pcr analysis showed that our libraries contain ests representing genes differentially expressed in the e genotype k <dig> and the ne genotype c <dig>  it remains to be established, however, which of these genes are implicated in the different responses of the explants from both genotypes upon se culture conditions, and in particular in the early stages of se. a transcriptional analysis by cdna microarray is currently performed for explants of k <dig> and c <dig> during the first  <dig> days of se culture. this should lead to the identification of genes differentially expressed during se, and their expression patterns may provide clues on their roles in this process. furthermore, preliminary experiments indicate that the number of se formed in explants from plants in progenies obtained after crossing k <dig> with a compatible low embryogenic genotype shows a continuous quantitative distribution, i.e. behaves as a quantitative trait. these plants are polymorphic for a large number of molecular markers, and a molecular genetic map for this progeny has been realized in our laboratory. this will serve to identify quantitative trait loci  for se, as well as to map genes differentially expressed during se. co-localization of genes differentially expressed during se with qtl for this process may help to identify those genes of which the expression is causally implicated in direct se in chicory.

this report also presents a medium scale sequencing of cdnas representing genes in chicory. in fact, of the  <dig>  ests selected from the e and ne library , only  <dig> showed homologies to  <dig> chicory sequences of the total  <dig> entries for chicory already present in the genebank nr database. though modest in comparison to databases for some other asteraceae, like lettuce, sunflower, and z. elegans, our database for chicory may serve as a source for comparative studies in this important plant family.
