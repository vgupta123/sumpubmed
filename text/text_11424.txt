BACKGROUND
the  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine  cap structure was first found at the 5'-end of low-molecular-weight nuclear rnas, such as u <dig> small nuclear rnas , u <dig> snrna, u <dig> snrna and u <dig> small nucleolar rnas  from novikoff hepatoma cells . in nematodes and some other metazoans, 5'-end tmg caps have been extensively characterized for trans-spliced mrnas and functional non-coding rnas , such as u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas, and for some of the snornas and spliced leader  rnas  <cit> . all tmg-capped snrnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii.

in mammals, hypermethylation of the m7g cap of the u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas to a tmg cap occurs in the cytoplasm, and depends on some of the sm core proteins  <cit> . unlike the assembly of the spliceosomal snrnps, which take place in the cytoplasm, biogenesis of the vertebrate snornps takes place in the nucleolar compartment, and hypermethylation of the tmg-capped snornas is not associated with sm proteins  <cit> . in yeast, u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  and u <dig> snrnas also have a tmg cap structure  <cit>  and hypermethylation of the cap structure is dependent on the sm proteins  <cit> , and a conserved methyltransferase, which is essential for hypermethylation of the m7g caps of snrnas and snornas <cit> . although the cellular function of the tmg cap is not clear, it is believed that the trimethylguanosine caps are necessary for the snrnas to fulfill their cellular functions  <cit> . the tmg cap is an important component of the nuclear localization signal of u snrnps, and there is evidence that core u-snrnps without a tmg structure cannot be imported into the nucleus  <cit> .

biochemical determination of a tmg cap structure has traditionally required several experimental steps  <cit> , and antibodies that recognize specific structures has therefore greatly facilitated screening for ncrnas with tmg caps. capped ncrnas have been purified from total cellular rna of vegetative microplasmodia by preparative immunoprecipitation with anti-tmg antibodies  <cit> . these antibodies specifically react with tmg-capped rnas such as u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas. this can also be used to isolate snrnps in one step from nuclear extracts of eukaryotic cells by affinity chromatography on a preparative scale  <cit> .

several strategies have been endeavored to detect or discover novel ncrnas, including both experimental and computational screening  <cit> . results from the recent tiling microarray studies also indicate that far larger portions of the eukaryote transcriptome than formerly believed are actually transcribed in the form of non-coding transcripts  <cit> . systemic examination of the 5'-end tmg cap structures at the novel ncrnas would be useful contribution towards decoding the cellular functions of these transcripts. here we combined immunoprecipitation and an ncrna microarray  <cit>  to identify 5'-end tmg cap structures in most of the presently characterized ncrnas in c. elegans  <cit> , and analyzed important characters associated tmg-capped ncrnas, such as function, biogenesis and expression.

RESULTS
ncrnas precipitated by the anti-tmg antibodies
we first filtered and immunoprecipitated worm total rna with the k <dig> anti-tmg antibody. however, after having been made aware that this antibody may have a reduced specificity for tmg caps and has shown some cross-reactivity with mono-methylated cap structures  <cit> , we repeated all subsequent experiments with the r <dig> antibody  <cit> . rnas in both precipitate and supernatant obtained with both antibodies were extracted and reversely transcribed. the cdna from precipitate and supernatant was labeled with cy <dig> or cy <dig>  respectively, and hybridized to a microarray with probes for  <dig> ncrnas  <cit> . for each of the  <dig> ncrnas, the intensities of precipitation sample and supernatant sample were examined. most of the ncrnas had a clear tendency to occur either in the precipitation or in the supernatant sample. with a few exceptions, the two tmg antibodies precipitated the same ncrnas, suggesting that both are able to effectively distinguish tmg capped ncrnas from ncrnas with other 5'-end structures . however, the data also indicated somewhat different specificities. for the snrna u <dig>  which have a simple γ-methylguanosine cap, a larger partition of this rna was precipitated by k <dig> antibody  than by r <dig> antibody . there was also a tendency towards precipitate and supernatant obtained with r <dig> showing higher and lower intensity ratios, respectively, compared to those obtained with k <dig> .

to get an estimate of the baseline expression, the cy <dig>  intensity data from  <dig> repeats of mixed-stage worms were examined. overall, the probability of the intensity of an ncrna in a single repeat deviating 50% from the average was estimated to be 10%. we therefore used an intensity ratio  of  <dig>  as a threshold for identifying tmg-capped rnas, as at this threshold the false positive rate would be only 10%, and no more than two of the  <dig> ncrnas studied would be falsely assigned tmg capped . at this threshold, the k <dig> antibody precipitated  <dig> ncrnas whereas r <dig> precipitated  <dig> of these . as the r <dig> antibody is known to have higher specificity for the tmg cap structure, the  <dig> ncrnas that were precipitated by this antibody were assigned as tmg-capped for further analysis .

detailed studies the 5'-end structures of c. elegans ncrna have apparently not been carried out, but all snrnas known to be tmg-capped in other organisms  <cit>  were assigned as tmg-capped in our analysis. similarly, u <dig> snrna, known to have a γ-methylated cap structure  <cit>  was assigned to the non-tmg-capped group. transcripts in ncrna families known or assumed to be related to splicing, such as the sl rnas and the recent identified sm y rnas  in c. elegans  <cit> , were assigned to the tmg-capped group. there were also  <dig> c/d box snornas in tmg-capped group, including u <dig> snorna, which has been shown to have a tmg cap in other organisms  <cit> . there were also  <dig> functionally non-annotated ncrnas in the tmg-capped group. none of h/aca box snornas were detected in tmg-capped group.

most ncrnas with an sm binding site element are tmg-capped
the snrnas are critical components of the splicesome, whose role is to remove introns from exons of immature mrnas. in eukaryotes, sm binding site elements  have been found in most snrnas, such as u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig>  <cit>  and in yeast, maturation of the u <dig> snorna is dependent on some of the lsm-proteins  <cit> . in nematodes, spliced leader  rnas, which participate in the processing of operonic genes, also have sm binding site elements  <cit> . binding of sm proteins is thought to be a prerequisite for hypermethylation of the m7g cap to  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine by the tgs <dig> methyltransferase  <cit> . the tmg cap and the associated sm proteins provide the nuclear localization signal for the cytoplasmic core snrnp  <cit> , suggesting that a tmg cap structure is always linked to the presence of an sm binding site element. in our results, there were  <dig> ncrnas that had a potential sm binding site element,  <dig> of which were in the tmg-capped group. other ncrna families possibly related to splicing, such as the sm y rnas, were also found in tmg-capped group. the potential sm binding site elements found in these worm ncrnas  were slightly different from the consensus sequence established for other organisms   <cit> . the sm binding site sequence differed somewhat among the u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> snrnas, whereas u <dig> snrna, u <dig> snorna and the sl rnas and the sm y rnas had very similar potential sm binding site elements .

there were also two tmg-capped c/d box snorna  that contained potential sm binding site elements. of the remaining  <dig> ncrnas, only two  contain a similar pattern, and cen <dig> was precipitated by k <dig> anti-tmg antibody with intensity ratios  above the threshold. there were also  <dig> ncrnas without sm binding site element that were enriched in the tmg-antibody precipitated fraction, indicating that hypermethylation of the m7g cap to  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine may occur independently of the sm proteins.

tmg cap status and transcription
primary transcripts synthesized by rna polymerase ii are modified by addition of a 7-methylguanosine residue to their triphosphate 5'-end shortly after emergence from the polymerase. the 7-methylguanosine "caps" of small nuclear and small nucleolar rnas are subsequently hypermethylated to a  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine cap. we therefore analyzed the relationship between tmg cap structure and the predicted mode of biogenesis for ncrnas in c. elegans. based on upstream motifs and other characteristics, ncrnas in c. elegans have been divided into four groups  <cit> , of which the first two were assumed to be transcribed by rna polymerase ii or iii, respectively. the third group comprised ncrnas processed from spliced introns with no evident upstream motif, and the fourth group was composed of other ncrnas for which no predictions could be made. twenty-eight of the  <dig> ncrnas predicted to be transcribed by polymerase ii  <cit> , have a tmg-cap structure, the exceptions being four c/d box snornas , two of which were precipitated by k <dig> antibody. on the other hand, only one of  <dig> ncrnas predicted to be transcribed by rna polymerase iii were assigned to the tmg-capped group. all the  <dig> intronic snorna without upstream motifs were also in the non-tmg-capped group. eight of  <dig> intergenic ncrna loci with no distinct upstream motif were in tmg-capped group, whereas one  had intensity ratios  around  <dig>  and the last one was assigned to the non-tmg group .

expression patterns of ncrnas in tmg-capped group
we next reanalyzed previous microarray expression data for the c. elegans ncrnas  <cit>  with respect to cap structure. the tmg-capped ncrnas were on average more highly expressed than non-tmg-capped ones. there were  <dig> c/d box snornas with a tmg-cap structure, including snorna u <dig>  and these tmg-capped c/d box snornas had much higher expression levels than other snornas .

the expression patterns of the tmg-capped ncrnas mainly fall into two groups, one containing splicing related ncrnas  and the other containing box c/d snornas and functionally unannotated ncrnas . splicing related ncrnas had relatively lower expression levels than those in the other groups, but displayed greater fluctuations in expression levels over the developmental stages and stimulated conditions. the two c/d snornas containing an sm site element had very similar expression patterns, and showed significantly low expression at the earlier development stages and significantly high expression in dauer . the other  <dig> c/d snornas in tmg-capped group had relative low expression levels, and most displayed little variation in expression during development   <cit> .

there were also  <dig> non-annotated ncrnas in the tmg-capped group. none of these ncrnas have an sm site element, however, their expression patterns are very similar to those of the two c/d snornas in the tmg-capped group containing sm binding site elements .

discussion
the  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine cap structure is conserved in eukaryotes, and was first found at 5'-end of some snrnas  <cit> . antibodies against  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine can react with intact tmg-capped snrnps in various organisms  <cit> . here, our results showed that antibodies against  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine works well in c. elegans, and can be used to screen for tmg-capped rnas.

previous studies have shown that the r <dig> antibody has a higher specificity for the tmg cap structure than the k <dig> antibody, and that the latter has shown some cross-reactivity with mono-methylated cap structures  <cit> . in our results, the r <dig> antibody showed high affinity than the k <dig> antibody. there were more ncrnas with intensity ratios  around  <dig>  for the k <dig> antibody than those for r <dig>  indicating a lower efficiency for k <dig> in precipitation of tmg-capped ncrnas than r <dig> antibody. in general, precipitate and supernatant obtained with r <dig> showed higher and lower intensity ratios, respectively, compared to those obtained with k <dig>  this also possibly indicated that the r <dig> has a higher affinity for tmg cap structures than the k <dig> at equal antibody concentrations.

in our previous work, the library construction procedure included a step to distinguish between 5'-end capped and non-capped rnas. the probability of an ncrna being 5'-end capped or not was determined  <cit> . the statistical model only partially detected the 5'-end capped ncrnas, and could not distinguish between different kinds of 5'-end caps. immunoprecipitation used here identified all ncrnas previously found to be tmg-capped in other eukaryotes. using immunoprecipitation and ncrna chip strategies, of total  <dig> examined ncrnas, we reassigned or refined the cap structure status previously assigned  <cit>  for  <dig> ncrnas.

with the exception of snrna u <dig>  which have a simple γ-methylguanosine cap in other studied organisms, all the spliceosomal snrnas have a tmg cap structure  <cit> . in organisms where snrna transcription has been investigated, u <dig> snrna is always transcribed by rna polymerase iii  <cit> , while the other snrnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> . it is believed that the tmg cap hypermethylation of snrnas is essential for the mature snrnas return to nucleus  <cit> . our results were consistent with the hypothesis that tmg capped ncrnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii in the sense that almost all ncrnas detected to have a tmg cap structure had previously been predicted to be transcribed by rna polymerase ii  <cit> .

all previously characterized tmg capped snrnas, sl rnas or snornas have a potential sm binding site elements suggesting that binding to sm proteins may be a prerequisite for hypermethylation of the m7g cap to  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine by the tgs <dig> methyltransferase  <cit> . another conserved sequence element, the box c/d motif, has also been shown to direct snorna 5'-end m7g hypermethylation  <cit> . our results further showed that also ncrnas lacking both distinct sm binding sites and box c/d elements had an tmg-cap structure suggesting that there may exist other pathways for hypermethylation of the m7g cap to  <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine.

CONCLUSIONS
combining immunoprecipitation and ncrna microarray strategies, we found that  <dig> ncrnas in c. elegans were specifically precipitated by anti- <dig> ,7-trimethylguanosine antibodies. as anticipated, ncrnas enriched by anti-tmg antibody mainly fall into certain functional categories and certain biogenesis group. almost all ncrnas containing an sm binding site also had a tmg cap. our results also showed that  <dig> ncrnas in tmg-capped group did not have an sm binding site element. almost all ncrnas in the tmg-capped group had been predicted to be transcribed by rna polymerase ii, whereas most ncrnas in the non-tmg-capped group were assumed to be transcribed by rna polymerase iii or spliced from introns. six functionally non-annotated ncrnas were also found in the tmg-cap group, which suggests that these ncrnas might also be transcribed by rna polymerase ii.
