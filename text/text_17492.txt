BACKGROUND
the cell nucleus is a highly complex organelle that organizes the comprehensive assembly of our genes and their corresponding regulatory factors. accordingly, the cell nucleus reflects the intricate regulation of various biological activities. although protein complexes disperse throughout the entire organelle, it is known that many nuclear proteins participating in related pathways tend to concentrate into specific areas  <cit> . for example, the rdna processing and ribosome biogenesis often occur within the nucleolus and the proteins responsible for pre-splicing appear to concentrate into multiple nuclear speckles, even while they are migrating in the nucleus. the confinement of biomolecules within specific compartments is crucial for the formation and function of the cell nucleus; in contrast, the mis-localization of proteins can lead to both human genetic disease and cancer  <cit> .

accordingly, information on protein subnuclear localization is essential for a full understanding of genomic regulation and function. advances in experimental technology have enabled the large-scale identification of nuclear proteins. however, at the same time, the sequencing of both the human and mouse genomes has generated an enormous inventory of primary sequences with unknown functions. a faster and cheaper bioinformatics tool is required for the annotation of these exponentially accumulating sequences. a computational prediction of protein subnuclear compartments from primary protein sequences can provide important clues to the function of novel proteins.

a host of systems for the prediction of protein subcellular localizations has emerged over the last two decades  <cit> . this list includes several web-based predictors that have a broad coverage of subcellular localizations at the genomic level, such as psort  <cit> , subloc  <cit> , proteome analyst  <cit> , cello  <cit> , psortb v. <dig>   <cit> , and loctree  <cit> . the development led to the ability to predict the particular subcellular compartment, in which a given protein resides within a cell, with a steadily increasing accuracy. the predictions for eukaryotic organisms, however, have certain limitations. they can provide information on whether a protein localizes in the nuclear compartment, but they can not discriminate among the sub-compartments in which it functions.

the prediction of protein localization at the subnuclear level is challenging compared with that at the subcellular level. three facts contribute to the difficulty:  proteins within the cell nucleus face no apparent physical barrier like a membrane  <cit> ;  the nucleus is far more compact and complicated in comparison with other compartments in a cell  <cit> ; and  protein complexes within the cell nucleus are not static  <cit> . recent developments in live-cell imaging have revealed that nuclear processes may rely on a constant flow of molecules between dynamic compartments created by relatively immobile binding or assembly sites. as proteins diffuse through the nuclear space, they appear to alter their compartments during different phases of the cell cycle or accompanying differentiation  <cit> . for instance, some nucleolar proteins are continually exchanging between the nucleoplasm and the nucleolus. proteomic studies have also highlighted the dynamic nature of the nucleolar proteome  <cit> .

employing the database nuclear protein database  developed by dellaire, farrall and bickmore  <cit> , bickmore and sutherland  <cit>  recently addressed the characteristics of the primary sequences of nuclear proteins, such as the molecular weight, isoelectric point, and amino acid composition for proteins in different subnuclear compartments. they also found that motifs and domains are often shared by proteins co-localized within the same subnuclear compartment. furthermore, certain generally abundant motifs/domains are lacking from the proteins concentrated in some specific areas of the nucleus. based on these findings, it should be possible to combine totality of this information in a manner that will enhance the prediction of compartmental-specific nuclear localizations of the protein constituents listed in genome databases.

encouraged by our previous success in the design of a metric for the biological similarity of protein sequences  <cit> , a prediction system is developed based on support vector machines , one of the most advanced machine learning methods  <cit> . the principal feature of our mode of analysis is the introduction of new kernel functions which are effective in capturing the subtle difference between sequences originated from two distinct nuclear compartments.

RESULTS
normally, conventional k-peptide encoding vectors  are used for the description of a protein sequence. successful applications include  the protein fold recognition  <cit> , and  the prediction of subcellular localization  <cit> . the basic concept of the new kernels proposed in our previous work  <cit>  is the measurement of biological similarity for k-peptides, having either none or a few shared residues, with the incorporation of evolutionary information. our finding indicates that the mapping of conventional k-peptide encoding vectors by a matrix formed with high-scored pairs of k-peptides can facilitate the construction of a suitable metric. the score of a pair of k-peptides is calculated by the blosum scores of residues and, therefore, the evolutionary information of the residues is embedded into the sequence description. a related concept that links two k-peptides with a small number of mutated residues has been presented by leslie et al.  <cit>  for protein homology detection.

this study presents the performance of conventional k-peptide encoding methods and the new proposed kernels for the prediction of protein subnuclear compartments. furthermore, with the use of the jury voting scheme developed in  <cit> , an integrated system was built by combining binary prediction outcomes obtained from different sequence encoding schemes. the results demonstrate that the integrated system enhances the overall performance of the system.

the dataset used in this study was extracted from the nuclear protein database   <cit>  using a perl script. the npd is a curated database that stores information on more than  <dig> vertebrate proteins, chiefly from human and mouse, which are reported in the literature to be localized in the cell nucleus. since certain proteins associate with more than one compartment, a test dataset consisting of proteins with multiple localizations was first extracted out. these proteins have the same swissprot id or entrez protein id though localized in different compartments. this preparative procedure resulted in  <dig> proteins that are localized within the six compartments described below. the majority is localized in  <dig> compartments and the remaining portion is localized in  <dig> or  <dig> compartments.

after excluding the multi-localization proteins, a non-redundant dataset was further constructed by proset  <cit>  to ensure low sequence identity . in order to have sufficient number of proteins for training and testing, only six localizations were selected for evaluation. these are pml body , nuclear lamina , nuclear splicing speckles , chromatin , nucleoplasm , and nucleolus . each of these proteins has a single localization and the total number is  <dig> 

it should be noted that the multi-localization proteins are not included in the set of  <dig> single-localization proteins for the leave-one-out cross-validation . therefore, the multi-localization dataset is essentially an independent testing set. the summary of the datasets is presented in table  <dig>

d1x <dig> – amino acid composition encoding vector transformed with d1;

d2x <dig> – di-peptide encoding vector transformed with d2;

d3x <dig> – tri-peptide encoding vector transformed with d <dig> 

the evaluations of the predictive power of the methods were performed on the datasets. since there are  <dig> localizations in the dataset, the one-versus-one multi-class classification system led to 6*/ <dig> =  <dig> svm models for one single encoding method . three encoding techniques corresponding to the conventional k-peptide composition and three encoding methods based on the new kernels were used for k =  <dig> , <dig>  svmlight  <cit>  was used as the svm solver.

the overall accuracy for the multi-class classification proposed by rost and sander  <cit>  was used for the evaluation of our system. suppose there are m = m <dig> + m <dig> + ... + mn test proteins, where mi is the number of proteins belonging to class i. suppose further that out of the proteins considered, pi proteins are correctly predicted to belong to class i. then p = p <dig> + p <dig> + ... + pn is the total number of correctly predicted proteins. the accuracy for class i is

where pi is the number of correctly predicted proteins of the location i, si is the number of correctly predicted proteins not in the location i, ui is the number of under-predicted proteins, and oi the number of over-predicted proteins.

in order to evaluate the performance of the system for multi-localization proteins, the criterion proposed in gardy et al. was used  <cit> . more specifically, for a protein with multi-localization, if the system validly predicts one of the locations, then the entire prediction is considered correct. it should be noted that this criterion overestimates the performance. since our method can only predict one localization for a given protein, other evaluation methods for multi-localization proteins such as the one proposed by chou and cai  <cit>  can not be applied.

the performances for each encoding method and the combined encoding methods are shown in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  respectively. the results for the single-localization proteins were obtained from the loocv procedure; and the results for the multi-localization proteins were obtained from the final prediction system. overall, the single encoding methods gave an accuracy of prediction qacc that ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for single-localization proteins and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for multi-localization proteins. the corresponding average mccs ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for single-localization proteins and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  for multi-localization proteins. the combination of the new encoding methods d1x <dig>  d2x <dig>  and d3x <dig> with the use of jury voting yielded an improved performance for mcc. for example, the average mcc was elevated from  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig>  for single-localization proteins and from  <dig> – <dig>  to  <dig>  for multi-localization proteins. the change in qacc was not uniform: it decreased from the highest value  <dig> % to  <dig> % for single-localization protein and increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for multi-localization proteins. the combination of the conventional k-peptide compositions aa, di, and tri did not demonstrate significant improvement. further optimization of the parameter for the determination of sparsity of matrix d <dig> is likely to enhance the performance of the prediction system.

aa – amino acid composition encoding method;

di – di-peptide encoding method;

tri – tri-peptide encoding method;

d1x <dig> – amino acid composition encoding vector transformed with d1;

d2x <dig> – di-peptide encoding vector transformed with d2;

d3x <dig> – tri-peptide encoding vector transformed with d <dig> 

the final models for the prediction system are the combination of the new encoding methods d1x <dig>  d2x <dig>  and d3x <dig>  since adding any conventional k-peptide encoding method does not improve the performance of the system. the predictions for all the  <dig> multi-localization testing proteins are detailed in table s <dig> in the supplementary file .

CONCLUSIONS
an svm-based multi-class classification system has been developed for the prediction of protein subnuclear localizations. this is the first system designed specifically for this task. this system, which integrates predictions from three new encoding methods, achieves encouraging levels of accuracy for six specific subnuclear localizations. however, compared to the prediction of protein localizations at the subcellular level, the corresponding prediction at the subnuclear level is far more challenging. this difficulty arises mainly from the biological fact that each compartment within the cell nucleus contains no apparent physical barrier like a membrane. furthermore, the nucleus is a considerably more compact and complex organelle in comparison to other organelles in the cell. finally, the dynamic nature of the nucleolar proteome adds an additional level of complexity to the task of prediction.
