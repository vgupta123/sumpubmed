BACKGROUND
the chinese hamster ovary  cell line is the workhorse of the bioprocessing industry for the production of biopharmaceuticals. the high productivity of the cell line in bioreactors can be said to be dependent on having a high viable cell density of rapidly dividing cells over an extended period of time. the relatively high cell numbers achieved over more than two decades of process optimization strategies utilising media and fed batch cultivation improvements  <cit>  resulted in product titres of more than  <dig> g/l.

in biopharmaceutical production systems, optimisation of cell culture processes is an evolving field as the more we understand of the complex dynamics involved in regulating cell survival, growth and productivity, the better we can apply this knowledge to improve titre. cell engineering strategies to improve maximal cell number would be a major step towards reaching the goal of increased product titre. the use of c-myc has been recently put forward as a possible means of achieving this goal  <cit> , but a more thorough understanding is needed to explain the role of c-myc in the cho-k <dig> immortalised continuous cell line. particularly, as a key regulator of the cell cycle and to provide a rationale for the experimental observation that the cell size seems to play an important role in establishing an increased cell number, before it can be incorporated into cell lines that are used for the production of therapeutic protein at industrial scale.

the product of c-myc is a nuclear phosphoprotein that has been implicated in cell cycle progression and apoptosis, although it is still unclear on how the protein carries out its functions and is regulated  <cit> . it belongs to a family of myc genes which was discovered as a cellular homologue to the viral oncogene  of the avian myelocytomatosis mc <dig> retrovirus  <cit> . the nuclear phosphoprotein has a short life of about 20- <dig> minutes  <cit> . its physiological role is based on the fact that its expression strongly correlates with cellular proliferation and thus it has been broadly expressed during embryogenesis and in tissue compartments that contain high proliferative capacity such as the mammalian gut and skin epidermis.

as a transcription factor, c-myc binds to the promoters of a large number of genes to regulate their expression, in turn, controlling, the cell cycle, metabolic processes, macromolecular synthesis and apoptosis <cit> . in quiescent g <dig> cells, c-myc expression is almost undetectable until there is some serum or mitogenic stimulation, which causes rapid induction of cell transition into g <dig>  after this transition, c-myc levels decline to a low but detectable level, while removal of serum or mitogenic stimuli will again put c-myc into undetectable level and thus cellular arrest occurs. some known targets of c-myc are cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig> , and eif <dig> and eif <dig> which are important in cell growth <cit> .

in the past few years it has become apparent that c-myc regulation is related somewhat to apoptotic pathways. pro-apoptotic pathways have been identified which converges on the central mitochondrial induced apoptotic pathway. this is due to the fact that c-myc over-expression also affects the arf/mdm- <dig> pathway  by promoting expression of arf and thus up-regulating p <dig> expression leading to apoptosis  <cit> .

in immortalised continuous cell lines, such as cho cell line, net expansion of a clone is not only achieved by an increased rate of proliferation but a decrease in the apoptotic rate as well. the most widely held opinion on this is that since the cell cycle and apoptotic pathways are coupled through several sub-networked pathways, the induction of the cell cycle can sensitize the cell to apoptosis but the apoptotic pathway is suppressed as long as the appropriate survival factors are available to the cell  <cit> . earlier findings have established a role for c-myc in apoptosis in diverse settings through separate 'death priming' and 'death triggering' mechanisms in which 'death priming' and mitogenic signals are coordinated  <cit> .

the objective of this study is to provide data for further understanding cho cells with an increased proliferation capacity. this work will focus on the cell cycle and metabolic aspects of having a cell line reach higher viable cell densities with increased proliferation under the same supplemented media conditions. since the variability of clones would not give further information related to this objective, the original transfected population is used. for the investigation into productivity clonal selection was used to ensure a stable producer of hseap fusion protein. over-expression of c-myc has resulted in a reduced duration of the g <dig> phase of cell cycle thus leading to a reduced growth rate and increased maximum cell number. this change was associated with reduced glucose and amino acid consumption rate and decreased cell size. the results showed that the total volumetric biomass was negligibly affected by c-myc over-expression and that without nutrient addition any increase in cell number would be compensated by a comparable decrease in cell volume.

methods
all chemicals in the materials and methods section were obtained from sigma aldrich unless stated otherwise.

cell transfection and maintenance
the cmyccho cell line resulted from calcium-mediated stable transfection of cho-k <dig> with the dorclag <dig> . the plasmid was kindly donated by dr. t. littlewood . the surviving cells were pooled separately for each transfection and were maintained in ham's f <dig> supplemented with 5% fcs. using dilution cloning a stable cmyccho clone was selected and used in subsequent experiments. a detailed transfection and selection procedure is described in a previous publication  <cit> . selection pressure was maintained by incubation in dmem/f <dig>   <dig> mm l-glutamine, 5% fbs  and  <dig> mg/ml geneticin g <dig> every 10th generation and cell samples were taken before and after incubation to ensure stable overexpression of the c-myc protein. selection pressure was removed  <dig> passages before an experimental run to negate the effects of the presence of antibiotic.

static batch culture and cell size of cho-k <dig> and cmyccho
cho-k <dig> and cmyccho were maintained in dmem/f <dig> with 5% fbs  and  <dig> mm l-glutamine at 37°c vented at 5% co <dig>  static cultures from each cell line were plated in  <dig> well plates,  <dig>  cells/cm <dig>  with an initial density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml allowing triplicate cultures to be sacrificed at regular intervals for each cell line. a duplicate culture was plated from the experimental seeding inoculum for mid-exponential phase harvesting to carry out the western analysis. when harvesting cells, floating cells were collected by centrifugation of the aspirated medium, and adherent cells were detached by accutase™ and collected by centrifugation, these were pooled together in a media volume equal to the original culture volume before cell counts. viable cell concentration and viability were monitored using the trypan blue exclusion method  <cit> . all cell volume measurements were done using the coulter principle of electronic volume on a quanta sc  flow cytometer which has forward scatter replaced by electronic volume.

static spent media cultures
the spent media was obtained from each respective culture to replicate conditions of supplement depletion. each cell line was seeded in t- <dig> flasks with  <dig> ml of the spent media at  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml at 37°c vented at 5% co <dig>  cells were derived from a mid-exponential phase culture. samples were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours for analysis of apoptosis.

transfection with the hseap-hfc gene
the plasmid, pfuse-seap-hfc <dig>   was used to transfect cmyccho and cho-k <dig> cell lines using fugene®  <dig> transfection reagent . transfected cells were incubated in fresh dmem/f <dig>  with 5% heat inactivated fbs  and  <dig> mm l-glutamine or  <dig> mm l-alanine-l-glutamine  at a temperature of 37°c vented at 5% co <dig>  the culture medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing  <dig> ug/ml zeocin™ and incubated at 37°c. after  <dig> days the transfected cells were selected in fresh medium containing  <dig> ug/ml zeocin™ and  <dig> mg/ml g <dig> followed by isolating the population of cells by limiting dilution. selection of stable clones was done by assessing for the highest seap activity for each cell line over a period of  <dig> weeks. to ensure that expression remained stable the cultures were cultured in the presence of g <dig> and zeocin™ every 10th generation.

western analysis
total cellular protein was prepared from cells washed in  <dig>  m sucrose and resuspended in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer : 2%  chaps,  <dig>  m urea,  <dig> %  pharmalyte ph 3- <dig>  1%  dtt  and  <dig> protease inhibitor tablet per  <dig> ml  for  <dig> minutes before subsequent 4°c centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> minutes. sample was stored at -80°c for minimum of  <dig> hours before concentration determination using a modified bradford assay  <cit> .  <dig> μg/well underwent electrophoresis on a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  mini gel  after dilution in 1× laemli buffer prior to denaturation at 95°c for  <dig> minutes. the gel was stained with instantblue™  for visual verification of loading before de-staining for electrotransfer. the protein was then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane . then, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody, anti-myc 9e <dig> antibody , and then incubated with a hrp conjugated anti-mouse whole igg from goat as the secondary antibody. bands were developed by chemiluminescent detection  according to the manufacturer's instructions. the membrane was stained with ponceau s to re-verify loading and uniformity of the electrotransfer.

static cell cycle data
flow cytometry was used to determine the percentage of cells in various phases of the cell cycle. every  <dig> hours both cho-k <dig> and cmyccho were dissociated from the wells using accutase™, centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes and were resuspended in  <dig> μl of nuclear isolation media -dapi staining solution  at a density of  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml for  <dig> minute at room temperature. the suspension was then filtered through a  <dig> μm filter tip . nim-dapi stained samples were run on a beckman coulter quanta sc flow cytometer fitted with a mercury arc lamp, a 357/ <dig> nm exciter and a 465/ <dig> nm emission filter. the g <dig> peak was fixed at a specific channel number and a minimum of  <dig>  nuclear signals was collected. the distribution of cells in the g <dig>  s, and g2/m phases was analyzed with the multicycle software program .

analysis of apoptosis
cho-k <dig> and cmyccho cells removed at different times during the batch cultures and cells incubated in spent media were analysed for the percentage of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. dual staining for both annexin-v binding to phosphatidylserine  surface proteins by annexin-v- fluorescein isothiocyanate   and cellular dna using propidium iodide  was performed as follows :  <dig> ×  <dig> cells/ml were washed in ice cold pbs  and centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c for resuspension in 1× binding buffer  ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm nacl, and  <dig>  mm cacl2).  <dig> μl of annexin-v fitc was added to  <dig> μl of cell suspension and incubated for  <dig> minutes at 20-25°c before adding  <dig> ul of 1× binding buffer and  <dig> μl of pi  which was incubated for  <dig> minute before analysis. the sample was analysed with a beckman flow cytometer equipped with a  <dig> nm diode laser. a  <dig> band pass detection filter was used to obtain fitc fluorescence and a  <dig> nm long pass filter is used to collect the maximal emission of pi fluorescence  <cit> . fluorescence compensation was carried out before taking final readings.

cell cycle kinetics labelling
a brdu  pulse labelling and staining procedure for kinetic analysis of the cell cycle was initiated the 2nd day after initial seeding of the cultures in flasks.  <dig> μm of brdu  was added to the exponentially growing cells. after a labelling pulse of  <dig> hour at 37°c, cells were washed with fresh medium and then incubated in the corresponding medium for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hours with samples taken from triplicate wells. after the indicated brdu-free chase time, cells were harvested and washed twice in ice-cold pbs and centrifuged at  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes. the cells were then resuspended in  <dig> μl ice-cold pbs and  <dig> ml 70% ethanol was added drop-wise before leaving the suspension on ice for  <dig> minutes. the samples were stored in a -20°c for  <dig> week after fixation. the staining procedure to determine the dna and brdu content was a modified procedure from istfan n.w et al.  <cit> . briefly, the fixed samples were centrifuged for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> g and then washed twice with cold pbs. to this  <dig> ml of 2n hcl was added and left at room temperature in the dark on a shaker for  <dig> minutes before washing with pbs and then adding  <dig> ml of  <dig>  m borax to neutralize the acid at room temperature for 2- <dig> minutes.  <dig> ml of  <dig> % triton x- <dig> was added and left for  <dig> minutes at room temperature on a shaker after a pbs wash. afterwards, the pellet was resuspended in  <dig>  ml of pbs and  <dig> μl of anti-brdu fitc  was added directly before incubation for  <dig> minutes at room temperature in the dark. the sample was then washed with pbs and the pellet resuspended in  <dig> - <dig> ml of pbs before adding  <dig> μl of rnase a solution per tube and incubated for  <dig> minutes at 37°c. from a  <dig> mg/ml stock,  <dig> μl of pi stain solution was added per tube and left on ice for  <dig> minutes before bivariate dna-brdu analysis was carried out on the flow cytometer.

cell cycle kinetic analysis
dual stained samples were analysed with a beckman flow cytometer equipped with a  <dig> nm diode laser, a  <dig> band pass detection filter was used to obtain green fluorescence from fitc-labeled anti-brdu and a  <dig> nm long pass filter is used to collect the maximal emission of pi red fluorescence. the red fluorescence was calibrated by setting the g <dig> peak to a fixed channel number and green fluorescence was calibrated using an unlabeled control. the cell size was also taken simultaneously at  <dig> and  <dig> hours  with these samples to determine the relative cell size in each phase. cell lab quanta sc software  and the computer program winmdi v <dig>   was used to analysis the cytometric histograms. calculations was carried out using the equations previously described  <cit> . briefly, the bivariate brdu-dna contour plot obtained with winmdi v <dig>  had the cells separated on the x-axis according to dna content and the y-axis according to brdu incorporation. gating was established for g <dig>  g2/m, labeled undivided  cells, and labeled divided  cells. first, the relative movement  at each pulse time point of the cells during the s-phase to g <dig> and g <dig> was calculated using the following equation:

   

where fl is the mean red fluorescence at time  while fg <dig> and fg2+m are the mean red fluorescence of cells in each respective phase. this can be related to the following linear relationship:

   

second, the function v  <cit>  a quantity  represented by the following equations is obtained:

   

&

   

equation 3a is used when the times are less than the time for the g2+m phase  and equation 3b otherwise <cit> . here the fraction of labeled undivided , labeled undivided in g2+m phase , and labeled divided  are obtained from the bivariate brdu-dna contour plot.

the potential cell cycle time  <cit>  can be calculated using the value for v and ts in the following equation:

   

to determine the calculated time for the cell spent in g <dig> and m phase an analytical procedure described in white et al,  <dig> was used. this relies on the calculation of the solution to a cubic equation where the cell production rate  is obtained through a relation between rm, v, and flu <cit> :

   

where

   

after determining the cell production rate the following equation is used to determine tg2+m:

   

after determining tg2+m and ts the time spent in g <dig> could be calculated by subtraction of both calculated times from tpot.

determination of extracellular glucose, lactate, ammonia and amino acid concentrations
glucose was measured with an ascencia contour  glucose meter with the provided pre-calibrated microfill test strips . lactate was measured using the accutrend lactate meter together with bm-lactate strips . briefly, the bm-lactate calibration strip was used to calibrate the instrument to the accompanied bm-lactate strips. lactate was determined by reflectance photometry at a wave length of  <dig> nm via a colorimetric-oxidase mediator reaction. l-glutamine and ammonia were measured with a megazyme kit k-asnam  using supernatant from each day of the culture. the amino acids samples were taken at the end of exponential phase by centrifuging  <dig>  ml of culture for  <dig> minutes at  <dig> g and storing the supernatant at -20°c for  <dig> week before analyses. amino acids were analysed by alphalyse  and performed on a biochrom™ amino acid analyzer.

reporter assay
the hseap-hfc reporter constructs containing the seap gene were analyzed using the quanti™-blue™ seap reporter system , which detects seap enzyme activity. instead of a single reading after a determined period of time, multiple reads were taken at  <dig> min intervals for  <dig> minutes, after  <dig> minutes of incubation at 37°c, and used to express seap activity as absorbance units per second . the seap activity was normalized for integral cell area to generate relative specific productivity <cit> .

RESULTS
growth kinetics
the constitutive over-expression of c-myc, has clearly resulted in an overall increase in proliferation rate but also an increased maximal cell number under batch conditions. increased proliferation would mean that cell division has increased or apoptosis has decreased or both. the fact that c-myc has been shown to be a potent inducer of apoptotic cell death in mammalian cells  <cit>  in contrast to the viability data obtained in this work warrants further studies to explore the control mechanism of cell growth/death kinetics.

in addition, in order to confirm that the over-expression of the c-myc protein was still present after thawing the cell line a western blot was done from duplicate cultures derived from the experimental seeding inoculum and grown to mid-exponential phase to obtain the supernatant for analysis shown in figure 1b.

cell cycle
the cell cycle distribution of cmyccho cells in figure  <dig> clearly shows a consistent increased proportion of post g <dig> phases over the control . however, at the end of the batch cultures both cultures showed an increase in g <dig> cells indicating a decline in proliferation rate presumably due to increasing environmental stress resulting from nutrient deprivation and accumulation of toxic metabolites. previously, it was shown in cho cultures that the proportion of s phase cells enables prediction of changes in cell number and reflects the proliferation dynamics of cell culture  <cit> . it may be reasonable to suggest that the increased growth rate of cmyccho is a consequence of increased proportion of s phase cells.

cell size
throughout the exponential phase of the cell culture the cell size of cmyccho is shown to be smaller than the control. quantifying the relative cell size difference for each phase of the cell cycle it is shown that the exponential growth occurs with cmyccho having a smaller size throughout . with an average cell diameter of  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm respectively , while this represents a 36% decrease in cell volume, it indicates a difference in the mean volumetric biomass  of 1: <dig>  nm <dig> cells ml- <dig> for cmyccho:cho-k <dig>  a rather minor difference in comparison to the >70% difference in cell number.

beier et al.  suggested that c-myc over-expression may control cell size  <cit> . however, trumpp et al.  argued that c-myc controls cell number and not the cell size. indeed, fibroblasts have shown no need for c-myc activity for increasing cell size but such activity was necessary for g1-s transition  <cit> . other studies have reported varied results for the relationship between c-myc and cell size. for example, hepatocytes with c-myc overexpression have shown an increased cell size in one study  <cit>  and reduced cell size in another study  <cit> . an increase in cell size may well depend on the stoichiometric molar concentrations of c-myc leading to the cell size increase through the simulation of mtor via inhibition of tsc <dig>  <cit> , which might be the case in some cancers. while cho cells have many similarities to cancerous cells the contrasting results of decreasing cell size may not find explanation in mtor pathway and protein synthesis. however, it is not unreasonable to suggest that such a significant change in size would involve a major change in the metabolic consumption and secretion state of the cells, since the cell's ability to either get substances from the outside, or eliminate waste, is related to the surface area. since the increased cell number of cmyccho was independent of nutrient availability the concentration of necessary nutrients and energy required for maintenance and proliferation should be reduced if apoptosis is not enhanced; a suggestion is investigated below. it may be interesting to note that when a cell enters the cell cycle it has to reach a critical mass before proceeding to s phase. this work shows that c-myc can cause a reduction in the required critical mass for the transition into s phase by decreasing protein content  in addition to cell size. this suggests a decoupling of cell size from cell division, a phenomenon that has been also observed in stem cells and neurons, and in addition, elevated g <dig> cyclin levels in fibroblast cells can cause elimination of restriction point control resulting in smaller small cell size  <cit> .

metabolites
* consumed metabolite

individual amino acid consumption rates, shown in figure  <dig>  display an overall reduction in amino acid uptake at the end of exponential phase of cmyccho culture. the highest decrease in amino acid consumption rate is seen for glutamate, with 65% decrease in consumption. the difference in total amino acid consumption rate is approximately  <dig>  fold apart from glutamate  and alanine . the lower fold change for alanine and increased fold change in glutamate may be related to a difference in alanine transaminase reaction between the two cell lines, where cmyccho has an increase in the amount of nitrogen being incorporated into alanine  <cit> . the by-product of this reaction is pyruvate which can be used in glycolysis to lower glucose consumption and lactate production  <cit> ; an explanation supported by the current metabolic data . moreover, the lowered metabolic burden of a smaller cell size may also offer an explanation to the reduced metabolic requirements of the cmyccho cells. it may also possible that the decreased cell volume could mean that the energy requirements to sustain other protein synthetic machinery, not essential for cell survival, have also decreased.

additionally, since the mtor pathway and c-myc protein are affected upstream by akt  <cit> , over-expression of c-myc protein will bypass this pathway and partly decouple the simultaneous effect on both growth and proliferation. thus, since c-myc initiates entrance into s-phase, by acting as a transcription factor for several cell cycle genes such as cyclin d <dig> and cdk <dig>  <cit> , and since the mtor pathway suggests the same akt activation from the external environment as the control, cell size would not increase with increased proliferation thus decreasing the overall cell size distribution.

these studies together with the current data suggest that the decreased influx of amino acid is a consequence of the decreased critical mass required to enter s-phase. in limited cellular resources c-myc forces the cell to progress prematurely into s phase.

apoptosis
the data in figure  <dig> demonstrates that apoptosis plays a minimal part in determining the cell number during the growth phase. contrary to previous results the cmyccho cell line showed a slight decrease in apoptosis during the growth and decline phase of cell culture in comparison to the control. the data demonstrated that c-myc did not sensitised the cells to apoptosis stressors. the data are consistent with the control and c-myc over-expressed cells being equally killed by apoptosis at the later stage of cultures. quantification of apoptosis in spent media cultures  gave similar results to the batch culture where a minimal difference was observed between the two cell lines. after  <dig> hours in spent media both cell lines had 38% of late apoptotic cells in culture. thus, it is most unlikely that c-myc plays any role in cho apoptosis which triggers in cell culture by nutrient depletion and environmental chemical stresses  <cit> .

cell growth and hseap-hfc production
to understand if a transfected and selected stable population of cmyccho cells can affect the general production of a fusion seap compared to the cho-k <dig> population, the cells were analysed for production capability. upon transfection with a hseap-hfc construct and selection of the cmyccho cell line population, the procedure produced a cell line with an increased maximal cell density  compared to the control cho <dig> as can be seen from the resultant growth curves . the transfected cho-k1-hseap-hfc  remained at a lower maximal cell number of  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml compared to the  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells/ml reached by cho <dig>  the growth rate between the cell lines has a difference of  <dig>  hours in the doubling times with cho <dig> obtaining the fastest doubling time of  <dig> hours with high confidence of p <  <dig>  using the student's t-test. this result shows that in the two stably selected cells, the c-myc gene bestows greater proliferation even with the extra metabolic burden of recombinant protein production.

the hseap-fc activity was measured to be greatest throughout the culture supernatant for cho <dig> , thus the secretion of properly functioning hseap-hfc was higher in this cell line. the assay used the kinetics of hseap-hfc to determine activity rate via linear regression analysis obtaining an indirect measurement of productivity. as can be seen only on day  <dig> of the culture, when cho <dig> has entered the death phase, and cho <dig> is in stationary phase, the amount of hseap-hfc activity for each population is within  <dig> % of each other while the relative specific productivity of cho <dig> is  <dig> % of cho <dig>  this indicates that the cho <dig> cell line with c-myc over-expression has lower hseap-hfc productivity. there appears to be a consequence to the increased growth profile of c-myc expressing cho cells which is a reduction in the rate of active hseap-hfc production.

CONCLUSIONS
while over-expression of c-myc reduces the transition time of g <dig> phase to s, the resultant reduction in the critical mass required for this earlier transition to occur negatively affects the maximal volumetric biomass achieved in culture. in addition, the overall metabolic energy pathways are modified to decrease glucose and glutamine consumption rate which might explain the resultant increase in maximal cell density in the absence of nutrient supplementation. the shortening of the g <dig> phase by c-myc over-expression allowed the cells to have higher growth rate while reducing cell size allowing cells to achieve higher cell numbers. apoptosis was shown to be unaffected by c-myc, in contrast to previous reported results but production of hseap-hfc from a constitutive c-myc over-expressing cell line did not increase with the increase in cell number.

this report clearly demonstrated that by manipulation of the cell cycle kinetics, and indirectly its metabolic pathways, it is possible to reach higher cell densities in batch cultures with limited nutrients. however, the effect on recombinant protein production due to the smaller cell size and reduced metabolite consumption will need to be further investigated to establish c-myc usefulness in biologics production.
