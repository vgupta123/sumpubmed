BACKGROUND
botrytis cinerea is a pathogen ascomycete, which causes gray mold on a large number of economically important agricultural and horticultural crops  <cit> . this ubiquitous fungal pathogen is present often as latent infection. latency is generally defined as the period between infection and the appearance of visible symptoms and can in the case of b. cinerea be long and variable  <cit> . consequently, an apparently healthy fruit can deteriorate suddenly due to the development of this latent infection  <cit> .

many synthetic fungicides are used as the principal mean of controlling this important postharvest disease  <cit> . however, the growing public concern over the health and environmental hazards associated with fungicide use in orchards, the development of fungicide resistant strains of b. cinerea  <cit> , and the deregistration of some of the most effective fungicides  <cit> , have generated a great interest in the development of alternative methods to control the postharvest disease caused by this fungal pathogen.

to prevent the indiscriminate use of fungicides, a sensitive and reliable method to early determination of the fungus in fruit tissues becomes crucial. the ability to detect latent infections in fruit tissues should prove useful not only for early disease management but also for identifying infected fruit in postharvest. in addition, the quantification of the pathogen is necessary for the application of alternative methods of control, such as biological control using antagonist microorganisms because the success of this method depend of the ratio antagonist/pathogen  <cit> .

the detection of fungus in fruit includes classical methods such as isolation on selective media, which is useful but subject to limitations  <cit>  due to many pathogens can be masked by overgrowth of faster growing fungi. other methods, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  represent new tools for the detection of the pathogens by determination of their dna/rna  <cit> . unfortunately these methods are expensive and not easy to perform routinely, because they require highly qualified personnel and need sophisticated instrumentation  <cit> . in addition, to methods mentioned previously, some direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays  using microtiter plates have been developed for the detection of b. cinerea in pear steam, grape juice, and plants  <cit> , but at present has not been reported any validated method based in an indirect competitive immunoassay for detection and quantification of the mentioned fungus in tissues of fruits.

the aim of this study was the development and corroboration of a sensitive and specific elisa for b. cinerea quantification in fruit post-harvest tissues such as apple , table grape , and pear . the determination of b. cinerea was based in an indirect competitive immunoassay that used purified b. cinerea antigens, which were immobilized on the surface of the microtiter plates by a crosslinking agent. the b. cinerea specific monoclonal antibodies  were allowed to react immunologically with immobilized antigens and with b. cinerea antigens present in the fruit sample. these antigens compete for the binding site of antibodies. those antibodies whose binding site reacted with the immobilized antigens were detected by a horseradish peroxidase  enzyme-labeled second antibodies specific to mouse igg, using a substrate solution. the response colour obtained from the product of enzymatic reaction  was measured by an elisa microplate reader at  <dig> nm and the colour signal was inversely proportional to the amount of b. cinerea antigens present in the fruit sample. the method was validated considering parameters such as selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and sensibility. the results obtained were correlated with the damage produced in the infected fruits by the pathogen and with the dna of b. cinerea that was recovered from the lesions.

RESULTS
preparation of antigens and samples
the preparation of purified antigen and samples included a treatment with liquid nitrogen with the aim of exposing the antigenic sites. in preliminary tests this step was not taken into account, and the resulting signal was very low. according meyer et al, the monoclonal antibody, bc- <dig> ca <dig> recognizes an antigen, possibly a glycoprotein, with the antigenic binding site on l-rhamnose and the treatment with liquid nitrogen help to expose these sites in high quantities  <cit> .

purified antigens were immobilized on the surface of the microtiter plates by a crosslinking agent and were stable for at least  <dig> months.

quantitative test for the determination of b. cinerea
the fruit samples consisted in apples , table grape , and pear  without any postharvest treatment and were purchased from a local fruit market in san luis city, argentina

the method was applied for the determination of b. cinerea in  <dig> commercial fruit samples. all fruits were selected as much as possible homogeneous in maturity and size.

because the developed method was based in a competition between b. cinerea purified antigens immobilized onto the surface of the microtiter plates, and b. cinerea antigens present in fruit tissues, the absorbance at  <dig> nm was inversely proportional to the amount of the b. cinerea antigen present in the fruit sample.

a standard curve for the immunoassay procedure was carried out following our protocol with a series of purified antigens that covered a relevant range of concentration  . the linear regression equation was a =  <dig>  -  <dig>  * cb. cinerea, with the linear regression coefficient r =  <dig>  and a detection limit  of  <dig>  μg ml- <dig>  the dl was considered to be the concentration that gives a signal three times the standard deviation  of the blank.

the coefficient of variation  for the determination of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> b. cinerea was below 4% .

the precision of the elisa assay was checked with control solutions of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> b. cinerea purified antigens concentrations. the within-assay precision was tested with  <dig> measurements in the same run for each sample. these series of analyses were repeated for three consecutive days in order to estimate the between-assay precision. the results obtained are presented in table  <dig>  the b. cinerea immunoassay showed good precision; the cv within-assay values were below 4% and the between-assay values were below 7%.

a μg ml- <dig> b. cinerea antigen

the correlations between the lesion diameters of the fruit samples and the amount of b. cinerea antigen detected by the proposed method from infected fruit extracts samples obtained at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> d of incubation , respectively, are presented in table  <dig>  these results showed a correlation between the damage level and the amount of fungus present in the fruit samples. b. cinerea was detected even when the fruit rot was not visible yet but perhaps it had begun to germinate . tests in which the fruit samples were infected using different conidia suspensions of b. cinerea were also made:  <dig> ×  <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig>  and  <dig> ×  <dig> conidia ml- <dig>  respectively. absorbance measured after  <dig> d of incubation  did not show significant differences , because the method only detect germ tubes in the precise moment they appear, and the quantity of germinated conidia does not always depend of the quantity of inoculated conidia.

the accuracy was tested with dilution and recovery tests. a dilution test was performed with a control solution of  <dig> μg ml- <dig> b. cinerea purified antigens concentration in  <dig>  m pbs, ph  <dig>  .

the results obtained showed that the method developed had a lower detection limit and a shorter total assay time, than the non-competitive elisa previously reported, and provided a wider dynamic range  <cit> . in addition, this method elisa was developed for the quantification of b. cinerea in a complex matrix such as fruit tissues .

cross-reactivity studies with fungi isolated from fruits
the cross reactivity test of the monoclonal antibody for b. cinerea with the fungi frequently isolated from fruits  resulted in no cross-reactions, indicating that the antibody was specific to b. cinerea. the phytopathogens assayed were penicillium expansum ceremic 151- <dig>  aspergillus niger nrrl  <dig>  aspergillus ochraceus nrrl  <dig>  alternaria sp. nrrl  <dig>  rhizopus sp. nrrl  <dig>  in all cases absorbance read at  <dig> nm corresponded to maximum value indicating that the sample did not contain competitive antigens. we confirmed findings obtained by meyer et al.  <cit> , that bc- <dig> ca <dig> is highly selective to b. cinerea.

comparison of the proposed method with a dna quantification method
the method developed was compared with a dna quantification method  <cit>  for b. cinerea in  <dig> fruit samples . concentrations of dna were detected spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance changes at  <dig> nm showed good integrity by the high molecular weight bands on electrophoresis . the analysis was carried out with the extracts of fruits at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> d of incubation , simultaneously with elisa assay. the results obtained indicate a good correspondence between the two methods . these results suggest that the sensitivity reached for this procedure allow determining very low level of b. cinerea antigens in apparently healthy fruit that can deteriorate suddenly due to the development of latent or quiescent infection into visible disease. also, the dna quantified by the method developed by gonzález et al.  <cit>  from uninfected and infected fruit extracts samples was amplified by pcr, with the purpose of verify if the same correspond to specific dna of b. cinerea  <cit> .

the figure 3a shows the dna-b. cinerea from infected fruit extracts samples . the bands observed in the lane  <dig> correspond to a standard of molecular weight marker ; in the lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to a molecular marker  for each fruit extracts; in the lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the boty transposable element for each fruit extract and in the lanes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> correspond to the flipper transposable element for each fruit extract. the figure 3b shows control extracts made from uninfected fruits. there, only were observed bands in the lane  <dig> which correspond to a standard of molecular weight marker  indicating clearly the absence of b. cinerea.

the presence of both transposable elements  indicates that b. cinerea can be molecularly characterized as subpoblation transposa-type  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, a specific and sensitive indirect competitive elisa for the quantification of b. cinerea in commercial apple, table grape and pear samples was developed and validated. this inexpensive and simplified method can be applied for  <dig> fruit samples, per each microtiter plate with a total time for the assay of  <dig> min. preparations of immobilized antigen on surface microtiter plates were perfectly stable for at least  <dig> months assuring the reproducibility of the assay. this is one important advantage for the possible commercialization of the developed elisa.

the results obtained suggest that the sensitivity reached for this procedure allows determining very low levels of b. cinerea antigens in apparently healthy fruits. also, the validation procedures showed that the method developed was reliable and accurate and that was possible to correlate the quantities of b. cinerea antigens with dna of b. cinerea present in fruit tissues. in addition, the immunological reaction between monoclonal antibodies for b. cinerea and antigens from others fungi, frequently isolated from fruits resulted in no cross-reactions.

in conclusion, this method promises to be particularly useful in the analysis of symptomless fruits, either to locate latent infections, avoiding thus, conventional culturing techniques, which are not only time-consuming, but also are not able to give a quantitative result.
