BACKGROUND
the malaria mosquitoes within the anopheles gambiae complex vary considerably in their host preference. africa’s main malaria vector an. gambiae s.s. is highly anthropophilic, whereas the zoophilic an. quadriannulatus rarely if ever attacks humans  <cit> . this preference of an. gambiae for human hosts is a major factor in its high vectorial capacity for human malaria parasites. conversely, although the zoophilic an. quadriannulatus is a competent malaria vector  <cit> , this species does not contribute to malaria transmission because it rarely feeds on human hosts in the field, although it does so readily in the lab  <cit> .

mosquitoes’ host attraction is primarily modulated by the olfaction system and an. gambiae females are strongly attracted to emanations from human sweat. volatiles produced by microflora on the surface of human skin are believed to be responsible for the uniqueness of human odor  <cit> . over  <dig> volatiles are found in human sweat  <cit> , and while not all of these play a role in allowing an. gambiae to differentiate human hosts from others, it is likely that a blend of human volatiles is involved. for example, an. gambiae females are attracted to a mixture of ammonia, lactic acid, as well as a synergistic blend of ammonia, lactic acid and carboxylic acids . anopheles gambiae and an. quadriannulatus also show different sensitivities to various compounds found in human and animal sweat and/or breath. therefore, the relative quantities of the constituents of host odor blends, rather than the presence or absence of specific volatiles, could be important in determining attractiveness to various species  <cit> .

the antennae and the maxillary palps, the two main olfactory appendages of an. gambiae
 <cit> , are lined with sensilla that house the olfactory sensory neurons that express olfactory receptors   <cit>  or ionotropic receptors   <cit> . the binding of odorants to the ors and irs triggers the transduction cascade that sends a signal to the olfactory lobes in the cerebral ganglion of the insects  <cit> . because of this direct interaction between the receptors and the odorants, differences in host preference between species may be reflected in differences in the expression or molecular structure of the receptors.

currently,  <dig> ors . ors are heteromeric ligand-gated ion channels encoded by the highly conserved co-receptor orco and a specific or. ors differ in their tuning breadth and some ors respond to either a single or small number of odorants, while others respond to a variety of volatiles . irs are also heteromeric ligand-gated ion channels, but these can contain up to three different subunits that include one or two of the broadly expressed co-receptors ir25a and ir8a
 <cit> .

in addition to the ors and irs, odorant binding proteins  play a role in odorant recognition and interact directly with odorants. obps are small, water-soluble transport molecules abundant in the lymph of the sensilla. they transport hydrophobic odorants through the haemolymph to the receptors . currently,  <dig> putative obps have been identified , but only  <dig> obps are expressed in female antennae  <cit> . some obps almost certainly play a role in the transport of molecules outside the olfaction system, as two obps are known to be expressed only in female heads  <cit> .

differences in the expression level of olfaction genes have been observed between closely related species feeding on different hosts. expression levels of as many as 53% of the ors and 55% of the obps in the antennae differed between the generalists d. melanogaster, d. simulans, and their specialist sister-species d. sechellia which feeds on the toxic morinda citrifolia pairs. this is a significantly higher number than observed in other genes  <cit> . although some of these changes may be due to neutral evolution, several genes have undergone a major change in expression level along the d. sechellia branch, and are thought to be associated with host shifts  <cit> . for example, or22a is strongly up-regulated in d. sechellia. this receptor is sensitive to a compound emitted by the fruit of d. sechellia’s host plant morinda citrifolia
 <cit> . additionally, d. sechellia lost six or genes since its split from its generalist sister-species d. simulans, which lost none  <cit> . furthermore, an increase in olfactory receptor loss was also associated with host specialization in d. erecta
 <cit> 
. recently, a comparison between the day-time transcriptome of an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus antennae identified differences in olfaction gene expression that may be related to the difference in host preference between these sibling species  <cit> . it has been shown however that olfactory gene expression fluctuates across the circadian cycle  <cit> . here, we compare the transcriptome of both the female antennae and palps of the anthropophilic an. gambiae and the zoophilic an. quadriannulatus, during the early dark cycle, when both species are actively seeking hosts  <cit> . these comparisons further show the divergence of the olfactory organs of these two species, and allows us to identify species-specific chemosensory genes in an. gambiae that may be responsible for human host preference.

RESULTS
host choice assay
the attraction of an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus laboratory strains to human odor vs cow odor was examined in a dual choice olfactometer. consistent with the host preference of these species in the field and with recent work on laboratory colonies  <cit> , an. gambiae was significantly attracted to human odor , whereas an. quadriannulatus significantly prefers cow odor . therefore, the natural host preference of these species is largely preserved in strains kept in laboratory conditions for many generations.

gene expression analyses
three replicate female antennae rnaseq data sets and two replicate maxillary palps rnaseq data sets were obtained for both an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus. after quality control screening,  <dig> % of antennal reads from an. gambiae and  <dig> % of antennal reads from an. quadriannulatus mapped to the an. gambiae reference genome. for palps,  <dig> % of the an. gambiae reads and  <dig> % of the an. quadriannulatus reads mapped back to the genome. a higher percentage of total reads obtained for the antennae mapped to a single location in an. gambiae vs an. quadriannulatus , whereas fewer reads from the palps mapped to only one location for this species . additionally, the mapping software reported that no an. quadriannulatus reads remained unmapped due to mismatches with the reference genome, hence the difference in read mapping is not due to a divergence between the genomes of the two species.

we obtained  <dig>  to  <dig>  million mapped reads for each of the six antennal samples, for a total of  <dig>  million mapped reads. between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million mapped reads were obtained for each of the four maxillary palp samples, for a total of  <dig>  million. clustering of the variance-stabilized transformed counts shows that for both antennae and maxillary palp samples there was relatively little variation among biological replicates relative to differences among tissues and species .

a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  annotated genes were detected in the antennae of an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus respectively. of these,  <dig>   are significantly higher expressed  in antennae of an. gambiae and  <dig>   in the antennae of an. quadriannulatus . in the maxillary palps,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes are expressed in an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus, respectively. of these,  <dig>   genes are significantly up-regulated in an. gambiae and  <dig>   in an. quadriannulatus respectively .figure  <dig>

a gene ontology analysis  was conducted to recover descriptions of molecular and biological function. for this analysis only significantly enhanced genes that were more than 2-fold expressed were considered. this resulted in  <dig> antennal genes in an. gambiae and  <dig> antennal genes in an. quadriannulatus . for the maxillary palps,  <dig> and  <dig> genes met these criteria in the two respective species . of these,  <dig> genes are shared between the antenna and palps of an. gambiae, and  <dig> of these genes are shared between tissues in an. quadriannulatus . not surprisingly, some of the gene ontology  terms recovered in the significantly enhanced genes are connected to olfaction  and signal transduction . additionally, we found strong representation of terms connected to enzymatic activity. for example, “transferase activity” represents 7% of the up-regulated genes in the antennae of an. gambiae and 5% of those in the maxillary palps of this species .figure  <dig>

olfactory receptors
out of the  <dig> annotated olfactory receptors ,  <dig> were detected above the threshold in the antennae of at least one species . as expected, the co-receptor orco is highly expressed in both an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus female antennae , but is significantly higher in an. quadriannulatus  . consistent with this observation, the total expression of the specific ors is higher in this species as well , which is also reflected in the regression slope  for or expression between species.

a total of  <dig> ors are expressed at a significantly higher level in an. gambiae female antennae  and substantially up-regulated  in an. gambiae. two expressed ors  were not expressed in the antennae of an. quadriannulatus, but these were among the least abundant ors in an. gambiae as well .table  <dig>

in contrast to an. gambiae, twenty-eight specific ors are expressed at a significantly higher level in the female antennae of an. quadriannulatus. in this species or <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> stand out by being both highly expressed  and substantially enhanced . four ors  are expressed only in the antennae of an. quadriannulatus, although at low levels .

although no abundant ors are uniquely expressed in the antennae of either species, our analysis identifies a set of ors that show clear species-specific enhancement of their antennal expression. despite these specific differences, a linear regression analysis shows that overall antennal or expression is highly correlated between the two species with .

strikingly, the overall expression of ors is much higher in the palps of an. quadriannulatus compared to an. gambiae. for example, orco is expressed at  <dig>  and  <dig>  rpkm in an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus respectively, and the regression slope for or expression between the two species is  <dig>  . this  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold enhancement of olfactory receptors expression implies a relatively larger importance of the maxillary palps in the olfaction system of an. quadriannulatus.figure  <dig>

that being said, ors are expressed at much lower level in the palps than in the antennae for both an. gambiae  and an. quadriannulatus . the number of detected ors is also substantially less in the maxillary palps. only  <dig> specific ors were detected in the palps of an. gambiae, whereas  <dig> are present in the an. quadriannulatus female palps . interestingly, one olfactory receptor, or <dig>  is unique to the maxillary palps of an. gambiae. this gene is among the seven most abundant ors in this species , but did not reach our detection threshold in an. quadriannulatus . furthermore, this gene is all but undetectable in the antennae of either species .figure  <dig>

or expression in the antennae and palps is highly correlated in an. gambiae , but considerably less so in an. quadriannulatus . of the  <dig> ors significantly enhanced in an. gambiae antennae, most are enhanced in the palps of this species compared to an. quadriannulatus as well. however, there are two notable exceptions; or <dig>  which shows  <dig> -fold up-regulation in the an. gambiae antennae, is expressed  <dig> -fold higher in the palps of an. quadriannulatus. it is also one of most abundant ors in the palps of this latter species. similarly, or <dig> is significantly  <dig> -fold enhanced in an. gambiae antennae, but  <dig> -fold enhanced in the palps of an. quadriannulatus where it is the second most highly expressed specific or.

not surprisingly, given the  <dig> -fold higher overall level of or expression,  <dig> specific ors are significantly enhanced in the palps of an. quadriannulatus vs. an. gambiae. with the exception of or <dig> and or <dig>  these are also enhanced in the antennae of this species, or are not expressed in either . overall, the correlation between or expression in the palps  of the two species is less than for the antennae .

ionotropic receptors
the total antennal expression of irs is similar between species , with a regression slope of  <dig>  . of the  <dig> annotated irs,  <dig> are expressed in the female antennae of an. gambiae and  <dig> are expressed in an. quadriannulatus . ir25a, one of the co-receptors, is by far the most highly expressed ir in both species. however, both species also express ir76b at very high levels. this gene has been considered a putative co-receptor  <cit> , but which was more recently proposed to encode a na+ leak channel which in drosophila also plays a role in salt detection  <cit> . a total of  <dig> irs are significantly up-regulated in an. gambiae antennae, with nine  standing out by being both considerably enhanced , as well as among the more abundant irs . twelve irs are significantly enhanced in the female antennae of an. quadriannulatus. only two specific ionotropic receptors, ir75d and 75h. <dig>  are considerably up-regulated  and abundant  in this species. similarly to or expression, ir expression is highly correlated between species .

the total ir expression is much lower in the palps than the antennae , but like the ors is much higher in an. quadriannulatus . twenty-four irs are expressed in the palps of an. gambiae, of which only ir <dig> is significantly  <dig> -fold enhanced in this species, but it is expressed at very low levels in the palps  of both species . none of the  <dig> significantly enhanced irs in an. gambiae antennae are significantly enhanced in its palps. the expression of eight irs is significantly enhanced in the palps of an. quadriannulatus. six of these are also significantly enhanced in the antennae of this species. ir expression in the palps is highly correlated between the two species , as well as between the antennae and palps of the two species, with r2 =  <dig>  for an. gambiae and r2 =  <dig>  an. quadriannulatus  .table  <dig>

summary of olfaction/gustation genes whose expression is significantly different between
an. gambiae
and
an. quadriannulatus
, and those who are also > 2-fold expressed


an. gambiae
an. quadriannulatus


odorant binding proteins
as expected based on obp function, obp expression in the antennae is considerably higher than that of the ors and irs . in fact, obp <dig> is by far the most highly expressed gene in the antennae of both species, and nine of the top  <dig> most highly expressed genes are obps . that being said, only  <dig> and  <dig> of the  <dig> putative obps were detected in an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus female antennae.

the overall level of antennal obp expression is similar in an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus . expression of eleven obps is significantly enhanced in an. gambiae female antennae, and three abundant odorant binding proteins, obp <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are more than  <dig> -fold enhanced in this species . the expression of five obps was significantly higher in an. quadriannulatus, but of the three that were considerably up-regulated , only obp <dig> was expressed at any appreciable level . similarly to or and ir expression, antennal obp expression was highly correlated between species .

also consistent with or and ir expression, the obp abundance in the palps is considerably lower than in the antennae . again similar to or and ir expression, the overall obp expression is several folds higher in the palps of an. quadriannulatus as compared to an. gambiae . furthermore, obp <dig>  the most abundant gene in the antennae of both species, ranks 8th in an. gambiae maxillary palps in abundance, whereas it is also the most highly expressed of all genes in an. quadriannulatus.

one relatively abundant odorant binding protein, obp <dig> , is expressed at significantly higher levels in an. gambiae palps , and is also significantly up-regulated in the antennae of an. gambiae. not surprisingly given the  <dig> -fold higher level of overall obp expression in an. quadriannulatus palps,  <dig> obps are significantly enhanced in this species, including obp <dig> . however, the correlation between obp expression in the palps of the two species is high , and there is also a strong correlation between obp expression in the antennae and palps for both species .

gustatory receptors
the gustatory receptors  are expressed at very low levels in the antennae of both species, with total rpkm values of  <dig> and  <dig> in an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus respectively . none-the-less, the expression of seven aggrs is significantly enhanced in an. gambiae, and the same number is significantly up-regulated in an. quadriannulatus. interestingly, five aggrs that are significantly enhanced in an. gambiae  are not expressed in an. quadriannulatus, although the expression of these genes in an. gambiae is low as well, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  rpkm. to compare, ranking these with the ors in level of abundance would place aggr <dig> in 44th position. two aggrs, aggr <dig> and aggr <dig>  stand out in the an. quadriannulatus antennal dataset. they are relatively abundant in this species  and significantly up-regulated . in contrast to the olfaction gene families, little correlation exists between aggr expression in the antennae of the two species .

only  <dig> out of  <dig> annotated aggrs are expressed in the palps of an. gambiae, and  <dig> are expressed in an. quadriannulatus palps . the three aggrs responsible for co <dig> detection in mosquito palps  are by far the most highly expressed aggrs in an. quadriannulatus. interestingly, the expression level of these co <dig> receptor genes is between  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold higher in this species, but is on par with the expression of other aggrs, such as aggr <dig> and  <dig>  in an. gambiae. overall the regression slope between the two species for the palps is  <dig>  , indicating a much higher expression in an. quadriannulatus, but this is entirely due to the co <dig> receptors.

probably the most striking result from the palp data set is a set of species-specific aggrs in an. gambiae. the five up-regulated gustatory receptors from the an. gambiae antennae  are in fact highly abundant in the palps of this species . interestingly, they are all but absent from the palps of an. quadriannulatus .

similarly, four aggrs  are abundant and up-regulated in an. quadriannulatus palps . these genes are all at very low levels in an. gambiae palps, with aggr <dig> being unique to an. quadriannulatus. interestingly, this gene is also expressed at high levels in the antennae of an. quadriannulatus .

discussion
because of an. gambiae’s odor-mediated host seeking behavior  <cit> , it is expected that its preference for human hosts has a strong genetic basis in its olfactory system. this system is primarily housed in the antennae, but the maxillary palps are also involved  <cit> . in this study a comparison of the olfactory organ transcriptomes of the anthropophilic an. gambiae and its zoophilic sibling species an. quadriannulatus identified species-specific patterns of olfaction gene expression. even though the expression profiles of olfaction genes are highly correlated between species, clear differences were observed which identify olfaction genes that may play an important role in differential host preference.

the olfactory system of anopheles mosquitoes plays a role in at least two other aspects of their biology; finding a sugar source, most often nectar, and identifying oviposition sites. no data is available on how often or from what source an. quadriannulatus females obtain sugar meals. however, an. gambiae starts ignoring honey volatiles five days after emergence and responds almost exclusively to human odor at that point  <cit> . our experience in the laboratory indicates that an. quadriannulatus also switches to host seeking around this time. the larval ecology of both species appears to be similar, with both breeding in shallow, open, sunlit fresh water pools  <cit> , and in any case oviposition-site searching does not commence until 48 hours post-blood feeding. therefore, although we cannot rule out that the differences in olfaction gene expression between the two species are due to biological differences other than host-seeking, there is no data to suggest that such differences are substantial. in addition, the use of 6-day old females in our study optimizes our ability to detect differences in olfaction gene expression that are related to host-seeking  <cit> .

in the antennal transcriptome, seven ors  and nine irs  stand out by being among the more highly expressed receptor genes, while also being considerably up-regulated in an. gambiae . we speculate that the enhanced expression of some of these genes in an. gambiae contributes to an increased sensitivity to human odor. divergence in olfaction gene expression associated with host specialization has been observed between closely related drosophila species that feed on different host plants. antennal expression of ors differed markedly between the generalists d. melanogaster, d. simulans, and their specialist sister-species d. sechellia, and as many as 53% of the ors were differentially expressed between species pairs  <cit> .

previous studies have examined the response of  <dig> agors to a wide range of odorants  <cit> . these included  <dig> of the  <dig> ors enhanced in an. gambiae in the present study. only four receptors showed a positive response to any of the tested odorants. the exposure of or <dig> to eight human volatiles led to a small to moderate increase in the firing rate of the neuron  <cit> . or <dig> has a very narrow tuning curve and responded strongly to only two of the tested odorants, however neither of which are of human origin  <cit> . or <dig> responded mildly to one human odorant , as well as to several other chemicals  <cit> . finally, or <dig> on the other hand responded strongly to two known human odorants, 1-octen-3-ol and 1-hepten-3-ol  <cit> . however, for many of these human volatiles it is not known if they are unique to humans. for example 1-octen-3-ol is exhaled by bovids as well, and is a common compound produced by mushrooms  <cit> . finally, it should be kept in mind that  <dig> volatiles have been identified in human sweat  <cit> , and only a small subset of these volatiles were tested on these ors.

expression differences in obps may also play a role in the human host preference of an. gambiae. several highly expressed obps  are enhanced  in the antennae of an. gambiae, whereas no abundant obps are substantially higher expressed in an. quadriannulatus. the presence of specific odorant-binding proteins is well-known to impact behavior in drosophila. flies carrying lush, a mutant obp, are defective in detecting an aggregation pheromone  <cit> , and obp57d and obp57e are involved in differences in oviposition behavior between drosophila species  <cit> .

importantly, our data shed new light on the role of the maxillary palps in odor detection in these species. lu et al.  <cit>  concluded that a relatively small repertoire of ors is responsible for olfaction coding in the maxillary palps, although it was found that in culex quinquefasciatus the maxillary palps are broad spectrum odorant detectors  <cit> . a previous analysis of the transcriptome of an. gambiae maxillary palps indicated the expression of relatively small or repertoire  <cit> , with only four ors expressed at > <dig> rpkm. those data contrast with our results, in which  <dig> ors were detected in the palps of this species. although it is not clear at what level the expression of receptors is biologically relevant,  <dig> of these ors are expressed at >  <dig> rpkm, suggesting the palps may be able to detect a suite of odors. possible reasons for these contrasting results between the two studies may be that we conducted our dissections during the early dark cycle, and included replicates, which is recommended for obtaining reliable rnaseq data  <cit> .

another interesting feature of our data is the several fold higher overall expression of the three olfaction gene families in the maxillary palps of an. quadriannulatus compared to an. gambiae. clearly, the maxillary palps of an. quadriannulatus are considerably more important component of this species’ olfactory olfaction system than is the case for an. gambiae.

while no an. gambiae specific olfaction genes were identified in the antennae, an analysis of the maxillary palp transcriptome revealed several an. gambiae specific chemosensory genes. or <dig>  the seventh most abundant or in the an. gambiae palps, is not expressed in an. quadriannulatus. interestingly, this gene is also absent from the antennae of an. gambiae. this indicates that this maxillary palp receptor could play a species-specific role in an. gambiae’s biology, and thus may possibly be involved in human host preference. unfortunately, this or was not including in the odorant affinity studies discussed above  <cit> .

additionally, the expression pattern of several aggrs indicates that they play a species-specific role in olfaction. aggr48- <dig> are specific to an. gambiae, and these five aggrs are expressed at relatively high levels in the maxillary palps, indicating a functional role of the receptors encoded by these genes. with the exception of aggr22- <dig>  which together encode the heteromeric co <dig> receptor  <cit> , gustatory receptors are generally considered to be primarily involved in gustation. however, the fact that aggr48- <dig> are expressed in both the antennae and maxillary palps of an. gambiae suggests a role in olfaction for these genes. these genes are located in tandem on the chromosome 2r and each pair is separated by only  <dig> to 326 bp. therefore, the expression of these genes is likely controlled by the same regulatory elements. additionally, aggr <dig> is specific to an. quadriannulatus. it is expressed at high levels only in the maxillary palps and the antennae of this species, suggesting a species-specific role. therefore, these gustatory receptors may play a significant role in the behavioral differentiation between an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus.

the several fold higher expression of olfaction genes in the palps of an. quadriannulatus dominates the comparison between the palps of the two species. nevertheless, obp <dig> and obp <dig> are more than 2-fold enhanced in the maxillary palps of an. gambiae. interestingly, both are enhanced in the antennae of this species as well, although obp <dig> is expressed at very low levels in this organ.

several other noteworthy observations result from these data. the expression of orco and the ors is 18% to 26% higher in the antennae of an. quadriannulatus. although the antennal sensilla of an. quadriannulatus were found to outnumber those of an. gambiae, their density is actually similar in both species  <cit> , indicating that this difference is not explained by differences in the antennal morphology. furthermore, the overall level of ir and obp expression is actually slightly higher in an. gambiae antennae. this implies that the overall sensitivity to the odorants detected by ors is higher in an. quadriannulatus antennae.

the expression of the co <dig> receptor genes aggr22- <dig> in the maxillary palps of both species differs markedly. these genes are expressed between  <dig> - <dig>  fold higher in an. quadriannulatus, which greatly exceeds the overall higher level of expression of olfaction genes in the palps of this species. by itself, co <dig> is a poor attractant to an. gambiae. it does activate and guide it towards a human odor source, but at this point other semiochemicals become important  <cit> . in contrast, co <dig> is highly attractive to an. quadriannulatus, which has a more catholic host preference  <cit> . our data suggest that the lesser attraction of an. gambiae to co <dig> is accompanied by a lower sensitivity to co <dig>  it has been suggested that anthropophilic mosquitoes primarily use co <dig> to detect hosts as a long distance cue  <cit> . given the smaller amount of co <dig> produced by a human vs. the preferred host of an. quadriannulatus; a bovid, and the relatively low expression level of the co <dig> receptor genes in an. gambiae, this species either relies little on co <dig> for its long range attraction, or is incapable of detecting hosts from the same distances as an. quadriannulatus.

although the an. quadriannulatus strain examined in this study showed a preference for bovine hosts, this species did not distinguish between human and cow sweat in an olfactometer in a previous study  <cit> . furthermore, when offered a choice of a human or equal sized calf, it blood fed equally on both  <cit> . this suggests that an. quadriannulatus has a wider host preference and is more of a generalist than an. gambiae. this is consistent with its much higher level of expression of the co <dig> receptor genes. however, the large number of olfaction genes with enhanced expression in an. quadriannulatus indicates that it, like an. gambiae, likely responds to a complex blend during host seeking, similar to an. gambiae
 <cit> .

rinker et al.  <cit>  recently compared the daytime transcriptomes of the antennae of an. gambiae and an. quadriannulatus. their results correspond roughly with ours. a linear regression analyses of the day-time olfaction gene expression with the early dark phase reported here, resulted in r <dig> values of  <dig> - <dig>  for the three olfaction gene families in an. gambiae, and  <dig> - <dig>  in an. quadriannulatus. that being said, a few notable exceptions were observed. for example, the expression differences for or <dig>   <dig> and obp <dig> was much less pronounced during the daytime. for a few genes, e.g. ir75k, 7t and 75g the expression pattern was even reversed. similarly, several olfaction genes showed differential expression during the day-time, but not during dark cycle . the expression of orco and a variety female antennae obps in female anopheles gambiae fluctuates throughout the circadian cycle. expression of these olfaction genes was generally found to be highest during the early stage of the dark phase, and therefore seems to be correlated with the female’s host seeking activity  <cit> . however, a comparison between light and dark cycle transcriptomes, suggests that the expression pattern of olfaction genes do not all follow the same diel expression cycle.

ionotropic receptors have been divided into “antennal” and “divergent” irs depending on whether they are expressed in the antennae of drosophila
 <cit> . it was suggested that this distinction held across a wide range of insects and that divergent irs play a predominant role in gustation rather than olfaction. additionally, it was found that antennal irs tend to be more conserved than the divergent irs. however, this classification has limited relevance to the expression pattern observed in the antennae of an. gambiae. of the expressed irs,  <dig> were classified as antennal, and  <dig> as divergent irs, although of the  <dig> irs not expressed in the antennae,  <dig> are divergent irs.

CONCLUSIONS
our data identifies potential human host preference genes in the malaria vector an. gambiae, but also provides new insight into the importance of the maxillary palps in the olfactory system. the palps are where the most dramatic difference in chemosensory gene expression is observed between the anthropophilic an. gambiae and the zoophilic an. quadriannulatus, with several highly expressed receptor genes that are specific to either species. finally, the expression patterns of several aggrs strongly suggest a species-specific role for them in the olfaction system of an. gambiae.

ethics statement
colonies of anopheles mosquitoes were kept following the arthropod containment guidelines established by the american committee of medical entomology of the american society of tropical medicine and hygiene. the behavioral experiments were conducted in the laboratory of entomology at wageningen university in the netherlands. approval to obtain an odor sample from a cow was obtained from the animal use committee of wageningen university.
