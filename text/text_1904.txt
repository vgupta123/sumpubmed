BACKGROUND
ptsd is an unique psychiatric disorder in that it is the result of a traumatic life event, and characterized by four clusters of symptoms: re-experiencing of fear memories, avoidance of trauma reminders, hyperarousal symptoms and negative alterations in cognition and mood  <cit> , which may appear after a few days or months, even last several years  <cit> . over the past several years, neuroimaging studies of ptsd have reported less activation or even deactivation in the medial prefrontal cortex  regions during traumatic script-driven imagery in ptsd  <cit> , and emerging studies showed that ptsd patients had a smaller mpfc  <cit> . and all these reports have been implicated that less activation of mpfc is associated with the pathogenesis of ptsd, and has played a key role in this disorder.

in the past several years, our research team have made great efforts on the dysfunction of the mpfc in the study of ptsd, and found there were apoptosis morphological changes by transmission electron microscopy  in the mpfc neurons of single prolonged stress -model rats  <cit> , which is a reliable animal model of ptsd, exhibiting behavioral abnormalities of ptsd and inducing enhanced inhibition of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal  axis  <cit> , as is a putative neuroendocrinological hallmark of ptsd  <cit> . however, the exact apoptosis mechanisms in the mpfc neurons remain poorly understood and require a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular responses to sps in order to reveal the pathophysiology changes of ptsd.

apoptosis is also called programmed cell death. in recent years, endoplasmic reticulum stress  pathway is discovered as another important pathway of apoptosis  <cit> . er is an essential intracellular organelle which is responsible for the synthesis and maturation of cell surface and secretion proteins, and maintenance of ca2+ homeostasis. disruption of these physiological functions leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins and induces er stress. at the beginning, er stress triggers the adaptative pathway, unfolding protein response   <cit> , which is essentially carried out by utilizing three types of er stress sensor proteins, perk   <cit> , ire1α   <cit> , and atf6α   <cit> , and results in the upregulation of er-derived chaperones and protein-folding enzymes leading the misfolded proteins undergoing the process of degeneration, such as an increase of glucose-related protein  family, such as grp78/bip, and the protein disulfide isomerase  family, such as erp57/grp <dig>  <cit> .

under normal conditions, er chaperone grp <dig> directly interacts with all three er stress sensors, perk, atf <dig> and ire <dig>  and maintains them in inactive forms in non-stressed cells  <cit> , and erp <dig> plays a key role as folding catalysts  <cit> . and when er stress occurs, grp <dig> is released and allows the activation and transduction of the unfolded protein signals across the er membrane to the cytosol and the nucleus  <cit> , and erp <dig> acts as a thiol oxidoreductase to catalyze the disulfide bond formations of the loaded glycoproteins  <cit> . and among this process, the glycosylation and disulphide bond status of the luminal domain of atf <dig> can be utilized as novel sensing mechanisms for the activation of the upr, and the cleavage to generate the active nuclear form of atf <dig>  and transported from er to golgi and then to the nucleus, to up-regulate the expression of grp <dig> and erp <dig> and reduce the unfolded protein load  <cit> .

however, when er homeostasis cannot be restored, the pro-apoptotic process is irreversibly induced  <cit> , executed by er resident caspase  <dig>  <cit> , which is a key signal involved in er stress-induced apoptosis, localized on the cytoplasmic side of the er, and nakagawa et al. have been found that has been cells from caspase  <dig> deficient mice are resistant to apoptosis triggered by the known er stress agents  <cit> . caspase  <dig> is specifically activated when er stress is induced, and the activated caspase  <dig> will enter cytoplasm from er, gradually activate caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  and eventually induce er stress-induced apoptosis. as during er stress, activation of atf <dig> is known to specifically up regulate chaperones, pdis, as well as caspase  <dig>  and consequently lead to apoptosis  <cit> , thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether endoplasmic reticulum -related pathway is involved in sps induces apoptosis in the mpfc of ptsd rats by examining the expression levels of atf <dig> alpha , two important downstream molecular chaperone: grp <dig> and erp <dig>  and apoptotic factors caspase  <dig>  caspase  <dig>  and caspase  <dig>

experimental animals
a total of  <dig> male wistar rats, weighing 150-180 g, about 6 - 7 weeks old, were purchased from the department of laboratory animals, china medical university, and were pair-housed in a room with temperature of 22 ± 2°c and humidity of 55 ± 5%. all rats were housed under a reversed 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle  and given standard food pellets and water.

groups and establishment of sps model
after lab adaptation and handling, the rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups of twenty. one group served as a normal control , while others were sps groups. the control group remained in their home cages with no handling until them were killed for test, and at the same time other rats were sacrificed at  <dig>   <dig> and 7 days after sps, respectively called sps1d group, sps4d group and sps7d group. the sps model was created as described previously  <cit> , which was described in “advances in basic and clinical research” international conference launched by japanese ministry of education in  <dig>  briefly, rats were restrained for 2 h and immediately forced to swim for 20 min in water . after a 15-min rest, they were anaesthetized by ether and then laid in their cages without disturbance until the experimental manipulations.

behavioral testing- morris water maze  test
to measure learning and spatial memory performance, rats were tested in the morris water maze  which based on the classic morris protocol. keep the water temperature °c, and surrounding environment was quiet and with constant light source. a 6-day testing study was performed as previously described in detail spatial reference and working memory deficits assessed in the water maze fixation and sections making  <cit> . briefly, rats were initially brought into a quadrant , facing the wall of the pool, to find the submerged platform within 120s. they were then allowed to stay on the platform for 20s. for learning performance, rats had four 120s learning trials daily each starting one of four quadrants in a random manner, with a 20s interval between trials. the escape latency to find the platform, calculated by averaging four trial values, was used to represent learning performance. each rat was tested  <dig> consecutive days for learning performance. spatial memory was evaluated at day  <dig> using the probe test, i.e., the platform was removed and animals were placed at a novel position. average time spent in the target quadrant  was calculated as an index for spatial memory.

brain tissue preparation and immunoflourescence assay for atf6α
five rats of each group were deep anesthetized with nembutal , and then infused with 200–300 ml of pre-cold saline through the ascending aorta, followed by 300 ml of 4% pre-cold paraformaldehyde  in  <dig>  m pbs. the whole brain was rapidly removed and dissected on ice, followed by 6–10 h of post-fixation in 4% pfa at 4°c. then the brains were embedded in paraffin. samples were cut into 7 um thick and mounted on glass slides until to the morphological studies. dewaxed sections were incubated with mouse polyclonal antibody against atf6α  overnight at 4°c. after three times washing, the sections were incubated with cy <dig> anti-mouse igg  for  <dig>  h at room temperature. after being washed in pbs and mounted. confocal laser scanning microscope was applied for localization observation, and five slides were randomly selected from each group, each slide was randomly selected five visual fields in mpfc, and eventually we recorded the optical density  of positive cells in each field to evaluate the average of od, andanalyzed using the metamorph/dpio/bx <dig> morphology image analysis system.

atf6α was activated in response to sps
atf <dig> is an er-membrane-bound transcription factor, a typical er stress transducer and is localized to er membranes  <cit> . it is activated by er stress by cleavage from the membrane, moved to the nucleus and activated transcription  <cit> . in the current study, we hypothesized that sps would result in the activation of atf6α. to address this hypothesis, the effect of sps on the expression of atf6α was examined by immunoflourescence analysis. as shown on figure 2a, atf6α was present in the normal control rats and showed diffused cytoplasmic localization, whereas obvious increases of atf6α were detected in response to sps , started at the early stage and persistently increased till 7 days. and all these results suggested that atf6α was activated in response to sps.figure  <dig>

upregulation of grp <dig> in the mpfc neurons after sps exposure in immunohistochemical experiment
grp <dig> is a key regulator of er stress transducer-atf6α, and plays critical cytoprotective roles in neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . to address the contribution of atf6α activation, grp <dig> was detected with immunohistochemistry assays in the current study. as shown in figure 3a, grp <dig>  was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of the mpfc neurons in the control group. all sps groups showed higher immunoreactivity than the control groups , and at sps7d after sps, the grp78-ir positive cells reached a peak , which revealing an upregulation of grp <dig> in the mpfc neurons in response to sps.figure  <dig>

increase of erp <dig> in the mpfc neurons after sps exposure in immunohistochemical assay
during er stress, activation of atf6α is also known to specifically up regulate pdis, such as erp <dig>  <cit> , thus we determined to detect the protein expression of erp <dig> after sps exposure by immunohistochemistry assays. as 1 day after sps, increased expression of erp <dig> was observed from figure 4b and 4e, then gradually climbing, and peaked at 7 days after sps , indicative of an increase of erp <dig> in the mpfc neurons in response to sps.figure  <dig>

sps triggered increases in the protein levels of grp <dig> and erp57
western blotting was also used to detect the protein expressions of grp <dig> and erp <dig> in mpfc of ptsd rats. molecular weights of grp <dig>  erp <dig> and gadph were  <dig> kd,  <dig> kd and  <dig> kd, respectively, and the clear representative bands were shown in figure 5a. the protein expression of grp <dig> and erp <dig> in the sps groups showed a marked increase compared to that of the control group, and peaked at 7 days after sps stimulation . these results were consistent with them of immunohistochemical staining analysis, and suggested sps triggered inductions of grp <dig> and erp <dig> figure  <dig>

sps induced persistently upregulations in the transcripts levels of grp <dig> and erp57
furthermore, we also examined an increase in total transcripts levels of grp <dig> and erp <dig> in the mpfc by rt-pcr. in control rats, very low level of grp <dig> and erp <dig> mrna were detected , however, the mrna expression of grp <dig> and erp <dig> both had a persistently significant increase in sps rats , expecially at 4 days and 7 days after sps . these results revealed sps induced persistently upregulations in the transcripts levels of grp <dig> and erp <dig> figure  <dig>

sps induced cell death through er stress and activation of caspases
just as shown as the figure  <dig>  brown particles presented in the nucleus under microscopy were apoptosis-positive cells detected by tunel staining. the control group showed a small amount of apoptosis-positive cells and has a lighter colour. however, 7 days after exposed to sps, the amount of apoptosis-positive cells increased obviously and the color of brown particles became deeper, and there was a significant difference in the number of apoptosis-positive cells compared with that of the control group , which further suggested the existence of the mpfc apoptosis. and to see the changes in cellular agents related to er stress and apoptosis, then tissue extracted from the mpfc were detected by rt-pcr, and the results showed that the mrna level of the executor of er apoptosis, caspase  <dig>  was persistently increased till 7 days after sps , which suggested caspase  <dig> was activated by sps, revealing signs of er stress-induced apoptosis. meanwhile, the mrna amounts of caspase  <dig> was gradually up regulated till 7 days after sps exposure  at 7 days after sps exposure, and the mrna level of caspase  <dig> had no significant difference compared to the control group at the early stage of sps, however, there was dramatically increase at 7 days after sps exposure . the up-regulation of the mrna level of caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig> suggested caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig> were activated after sps, and all those results indicate that er stress and caspase activation contribute to sps and sps-induced apoptosis.figure  <dig>

discussion
ptsd is a stress-related mental disorder that can develop in individuals who have been exposed to an event or events that involved the threat of death or serious injury and reacted with intense fear, helplessness or horror  <cit> . although enormous progress has been made over the past decade in understanding on the molecular mechanism of ptsd, the exact pathogenesis remains obscured. several magnetic resonance imaging  studies have reported decreased frontal cortex volume in ptsd  <cit>  and decreased volume in medial prefrontal regions  <cit> , some functional neuroimaging studies have typically reported less activation or even deactivation in ventral mpfc regions during traumatic script-driven imagery in ptsd  <cit> ; and animal data also have demonstrated the vmpfc is critically involved in the extinction of the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear  <cit> , particularly in the recall of extinction after a long delay  <cit> . these reports above have suggested that mpfc has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ptsd, and thus in this paper, we focused on this structure in order to understand further the pathological mechanism of ptsd.

sps is a model for pstd employed extensively  <cit> , which determined at the international ptsd scientific meeting held by japanese ministry of education in  <dig>  animal experimental researches verify that rats after sps exposure have dysfunction in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrena  axle, changes in ethology, activity habits, memory abilities and environmental adaptability reduces, in conformity with clinical manifestation of human ptsd. and sps could also mimic the specific neuroendocrinological abnormalities observed in ptsd patients, by conducting in three stages: restraint for 2 h, forced swim for 20 min, and ether anesthesia, which correspond to psychological, physiological, and endocrinological stress, respectively. in current experiment, we set up sps model and carried out mwm test to confirm whether the model succeeded. from figure 1a and b, we could observed that the escape latency was prolonged in sps rats at day  <dig> through day  <dig>  and when the platform was removed from the pool at day  <dig> for spatial memory testing, sps rats had much less time spent in target quadrant compared to the control rats. all these results revealed that sps model in this study was successfully copied, which had provided guarantee for subsequent studies.

given in our previous studies, our research teammate wen et al.  <cit>  have proved that there were abnormal expression of ca2+-cam-camkiiα pathway in the mpfc neurons, and dysfunction of cytosolic ca2+ concentration was taken as one of inducement of er stress, we deduced that er stress would be induced by dysfunction of ca2+-cam-camkiiα pathway in the mpfc neurons. and at the same time, our teammate yana et al. have found that there were expression changes of bcl- <dig> and bax in the mpfc neurons of sps-model rats  <cit> ; zhao et al.  <cit>  also have examined the apoptosis morphological changes by transmission electron microscopy  and demonstrated the existence of apoptosis in the mpfc neurons of rats after sps. as er stress would induce apoptosis, thus in this paper we hypothesized that er stress and er-related apoptosis would be involved in the molecular mechanisms of sps-induced apoptosis in the mpfc neurons of ptsd-like rats.

and as we all know, atf6α is a typical er stress transducer  <cit> , and to elucidate its potential alterations in the mpfc neurons after sps exposure, firstly we evaluated the levels of atf6α by the use of immunofluorescence assay. as shown in figure 2b-d and 2e, obvious increases of atf6α were detected in response to sps, started at the early stage and persistently increased till 7 days, which indicated that sps activated er stress transducer atf6α. and as at the beginning of er stress atf6α pathway triggers and results in the upregulation of er-derived chaperones to rescue cells from er stress  <cit> , next we detected the expression of a key regulator of er stress grp <dig> by immunohistochemistry, western blotting and rt-pcr. our results showed that the protein expression of grp <dig> increased  <dig>  4 days, peaked on 7 days after sps stimulation, and the mrna expression changes of grp <dig> were similar to the trend of its protein changes, which revealed that there was accumulation of grp <dig> in the mpfc neurons in response to sps. the accumulation of grp <dig> are beneficial because on one hand, as a chaperone, grp <dig> recognizes and binds to the proteins with hydrophobic residues in the unfolded regions to assist with the correct folding of the unfolded proteins  <cit> ; and on the other hand, grp <dig> also can form in a large multi-protein complex with a set of er molecular chaperones, grp <dig>  pdi, erp <dig>  and so on, which forms an er chaperoning network processing the unfolded protein substrates  <cit> .

given the atf6α pathway also can trigger and result in the upregulation of protein-folding enzymes erp <dig>  <cit> , we also observed the protein and mrna expression of erp <dig>  and our results showed that there were increased expressions in the protein level and the mrna level of erp <dig>  erp <dig> is a 58-kda protein with significant homology to protein disulfide isomerase and has two thioredoxin-like domains and is suspected to function as thiol-dependent oxidoreductase  <cit> . erp <dig> can interact with glycoproteins such as calnexin and calreticulin, playing an important role as a molecular chaperone during glycoprotein biosynthesis and folding  <cit> , and also can promote the formation of intra- or intermolecular disulfide bonds during glycoprotein folding  <cit>  to cope with excessive protein folding load and re-establish cellular homeostasis, and it has reported that erp <dig> has shown clinical applications to endoplasmic reticulum stress associated diseases and cancer  <cit> , disruption of erp <dig> in mouse is lethal. and during er stress, when the atf6α pathway is activated, the active nuclear form of atf6α is transported in the nuclear and then induces the upregulation of erp <dig> to copy with the er stress, which just as we saw from our results that the expression of erp <dig> was up-regulated in the neurons of the mpfc in response to sps, and comprehensive the above results of grp <dig>  we can draw a conclusion that sps triggered not only the induction of grp <dig>  but also the induction of erp <dig>  which both are the downstream of the atf6α pathway and indicators of er stress, and that is, atf6α pathway er stress was induced in the mpfc neurons in response to sps.

as when er stress is prolonged or severe, apoptotic pathways can be activated  <cit> , next we evaluated apoptosis using the tunel assay and performed rt-pcr analysis of the total transcripts levels of caspase  <dig>  which is a key signal involved in er stress-induced apoptosis  <cit> , and we observed the number of apoptosis-positive cells increased obviously 7 days after exposed to sps , and the mrna of caspase  <dig> also was persistently increased till 7 days after sps, revealing signs of er stress-induced apoptosis. and furthermore, as the activated caspase  <dig> will enter cytoplasm from er, and gradually activate caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  then we also observed the mrna expression changes of caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  and found that there were dramatically increase in the mrna level of them at 7 days after sps exposure , which suggested caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig> were also activated after sps. taken together, we could draw a conclusion that sps induced cell death through er stress and activation of caspases, er stress-induced apoptosis contributed to sps. however, as the activation of caspase  <dig> and  <dig> also can occur by mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, therefore, it is necessary to identify whether the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway also play key roles in inducing apotosis of the mpfc after sps, which is one of the limitations in this experiment. and furthermore, it is still required to elucidate the precise mechanism underlying sps-induced er stress and er stress-related apoptosis.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our studies demonstrated that sps triggered the activation of atf6α and the increase of grp <dig> and erp <dig>  and also up regulated the transcripts levels of caspase  <dig>  caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  our results indicated that sps induced atf6α-dependent er stress and er stress-related apoptosis in the mpfc neurons, which indicated that the endoplasmic reticulum pathway may be involved in ptsd-induced apoptosis and may provide important information for the pathogenesis and treatment of ptsd.
