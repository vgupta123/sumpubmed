BACKGROUND
the inflorescences of gerbera hybrida  are composed of three different types of flowers  that are tightly packed into a condensed, radially organized flower head . the presence of morphologically different flower types within a single genotype makes gerbera a unique target for reproductive developmental studies, since the traditional eudicot model plants  bear only single flower forms in their inflorescences. in gerbera, the first stages of development are morphologically similar in all flower types, with only the position of individual flower primordia in the developing capitulum conferring their developmental fate. however, later in development many morphological differences emerge. the most prominent difference between the flower types is in their sex expression. gerbera is a gynomonoecious species bearing both female and hermaphroditic flowers in the same inflorescence. in the outer female ray and trans flowers, stamen development arrests to form rudimentary staminodes  <cit> , whereas in the central disc flowers, anthers develop fully, produce pollen, and form a postgenitally fused structure that covers the carpel. furthermore, the corollas  of ray flowers are long and zygomorphic , whereas those of disc flowers vary from short-petalled and less asymmetrical to actinomorphic  at the very center of the capitulum. corolla size and color can vary continuosly in different gerbera varieties  <cit> .

admixtures of different types of flowers are common in species that bear capitula or otherwise dense inflorescences  <cit>  and probably reflect a selective advantage of this type of organization. the gerbera capitulum apparently mimics a large single flower, with the brigthly colored, elongate ray flowers attracting pollinators to the center of the inflorescence where bisexual flowers are located. flower head form within asteraceae can vary from radiate to discoid, bearing at least ray and disc flowers, or cycles of disc flowers only  <cit> . the prevalence of different flower head forms varies among the different subfamilies and tribes of the asteraceae  <cit> . the presence or absence of ray flowers seems to be under control of one or two major genes, but several modifier genes are also involved . perhaps the best studied system in this aspect has been senecio, where flower head type is principally controlled by the ray locus, with the radiate phenotype dominant over discoid  <cit> . gross phenotypic resemblance to the centroradialis  mutant of antirrhinum, which has a radially symmetrical terminal flower surrounded by zygomorphic axillary flowers in peripheral region around the inflorescence apex, has prompted research to test the hypothesis  <cit>  that the ray locus encodes a homolog of the floral symmetry gene cycloidea  <cit> . however, recent microarray comparisons of senecio taxa differing primarily in flower morphology revealed only few genes – and not cycloidea – potentially involved in observed differences in floral development  <cit> .

progress in the genetics of plant reproductive development over the last two decades has shown that the most important genes specifying flower development encode transcription factors, many of them mads domain proteins  <cit> . there are several examples in which homologous genes have evolved different functions in different species as the result of sub- or neofunctionalization  <cit> . furthermore, relatively simple regulatory changes in transcription factors can be responsible for the evolution of new morphologies . in this study we have morphologically characterized very early stages of ray and disc flower development in gerbera hybrida. we compared gene expression profiles among three different stages of disc and ray flower development using a gerbera cdna microarray that includes  <dig> probes representing ests from different tissues and treatments  <cit> . our goal was to gather an overall picture of the processes involved in early gerbera flower development by identifying genes that may function disparately in the differentiation pathways of ray versus disc flowers. surprisingly, we found that mads-box genes otherwise controlling floral organ determination were differentially expressed in the divergent flower types.

RESULTS
early stages of flower development in gerbera hybrida
during early stages of reproductive development, individual flower primordia arise in an acropetal spiral from the inflorescence meristem. undifferentiated ray flower primordia are the first to arise in inflorescences of less than  <dig> mm in diameter, whereas the first disc flower primordia are detected in inflorescences of approximately 6– <dig> mm in diameter . we divided early flower development into six different stages that were characterized using scanning electron microscopy  and histological staining . figure  <dig> demonstrates the first five stages of perfect  disc flower development. at stage  <dig>  flower primordia are small, undifferentiated bumps, whereas at stage  <dig>  ring-shaped petal primordia begin to form. at stage  <dig>  pappus , petal  and stamen  primordia can be clearly distinguished. until this point in development, both ray and disc flowers still appear morphologically similar and can only be identified based on their position in the inflorescence . at stage  <dig>  petals begin to elongate, covering the developing stamen and carpel primordia. flower organ elongation continues during stages  <dig> and  <dig> . as with sem, histological analysis reveals no morphological differences between ray and disc flowers at stage  <dig> . however, at stage  <dig>  stamens lag behind and are shorter in the female ray flowers compared to the perfect disc flowers . furthermore, at stage  <dig>  the ray flower petals have already fused together, and the shapes of the bilabiate ray flowers with their three highly extended lower lobes plus two minute upper lobes can be distinguished. conversely, in disc flowers, the developing petals are separated from each other. at stage  <dig>  the differences in petal elongation are even more pronounced. at this stage, pappus bristles are much longer in both flower types, nearly covering the developing primordia . in earlier work, we defined the stages of capitulum development based on ray flower petal development  <cit> . developmental stage  <dig> in ray flowers and disc flowers as described here corresponds to developmental stages  <dig> and  <dig> of the capitulum, respectively  <cit> .

microarray analysis of gene expression during ray and disc flower development
cdna microarray analysis comparing ray and disc flower primordia was performed separately for developmental stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the gerbera cdna microarray contains approximately  <dig> probes representing all distinct unigenes from the gerbera est collection  <cit> . most of the probes  printed on the microarray represent transcripts from floral cdna libraries and genes expressed during inflorescence development  <cit> . microdissected material for rna isolation was collected and pooled together from a single clone over a year's time from hundreds of flower primordia across tens of inflorescences. in circumstances such as with gerbera flower primordia sampling, where true biological replicates are not possible due to limited amounts of plant material, pooling is a means to minimize biological variation. for our experiments we also pooled several independent rna isolations and amplified them prior to dye labelling. each experiment included four technical replicates each with two dye-swaps. we have verified the present microarray results with real-time reverse transcriptase pcr for  <dig> random transcripts and for  <dig> gerbera mads-box genes .

following non-linear lowess normalization of the microarray data, a statistical analysis  was performed to discover genes that show significant differences in their expression. the analysis was done separately for each developmental stage. to minimize the number of false positives a benjamin-hochberg false discovery rate  was used to control the type i family-wise error. transcripts with p-value <  <dig>  were selected as statistically significant. with this analysis, the total numbers of differentially expressed genes were  <dig> at stage  <dig>   <dig> at stage  <dig>  and  <dig> at stage  <dig>  distributions of these genes within and between the flower types are visualized with the venn-diagram shown in figure  <dig>  only few expressed genes were shared between stages, demonstrating the rapid transcriptional changes occurring during very early stages of gerbera flower development. the raw data for the experiments presented here have been lodged at the arrayexpress under accession number e-mexp- <dig> 

genes differentially expressed during ray and disc flower development
at the earliest developmental stage included in the comparison , the disc and ray flowers were morphologically similar. this was reflected at the gene expression level, where few changes are detected. only  <dig> transcripts showed significant differences in expression with p-value <  <dig>  and fold change more than  <dig>  . from these,  <dig> showed greater expression in disc flowers and  <dig> in ray flowers. in disc flowers most of the genes were related to basic metabolic processes. one of the most abundant transcript upregulated in disc flowers is the gerbera homolog of vegetative storage protein  gene. vsps principally accumulate in vacuoles and have a putative role in nitrogen storage and in biotic and abiotic stress responses. in arabidopsis, vsp mrnas are highly abundant in flowers, where they may have distinct roles during reproductive development  <cit> . the gerbera vsp homolog also showed significantly greater expression in stage  <dig> disc flowers. in ray flowers at stage  <dig>  most of the upregulated genes encoded unknown proteins. however, one gerbera mads-box gene, grcd <dig>  showed greater upregulation. grcd <dig> has previously been suggested to be required for defining stamen identity in gerbera  <cit> .

the number of differentially expressed genes was found to increase with developmental time, in concordance with increasing morphological differences between the flower types. in disc flowers, the number of genes showing statistically significant changes in expression was  <dig> at stage  <dig> and  <dig> at stage  <dig>  and in ray flowers,  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. below, we limit further discussion to the group of genes showing flower-type specific upregulation during both stages  <dig> and  <dig> . in disc flowers,  <dig> transcripts were upregulated in both stages  <dig> and  <dig> . twenty  of these gave a blast hit while the rest have unknown function.

one of the most significantly upregulated gene had a match to gdsl-lipase. these enzymes are highly abundant in arabidopsis flowers and are postulated to have specific functions during anther morphogenesis  <cit> . gdsl-motif lipase genes are also highly expressed throughout tepal development in iris hollandica  <cit> . another upregulated gene encoded alpha-expansin, known to be involved in growth and development  <cit> . the most prominent group of genes, however, were those encoding lipid-transfer proteins, which form a large gene family in gerbera  <cit> . the gerbera c-class mads-box gene gaga <dig> was also more abundantly expressed in disc flowers in comparison to ray flowers at both stages  <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig> genes were more strongly expressed in ray flowers than in disc flowers at both stages  <dig> and  <dig> . of these,  <dig> % , had unknown functions, and many others encoded ribosomal proteins. most of the identified genes  were also upregulated during early petal development  in our previous microarray analyses  <cit>  reflecting differences in petal development that occur during early stages of flower-type differentiation.

g0000600014b <dig> , a member of the gasa protein family , was previously detected in elongating flower scapes in addition to being expressed during early petal development  <cit> . g0000700014e <dig>  annotated as a polyphenol oxidase precursor, was more than 5-fold upregulated in ray flower primordia in comparison to disc flowers. polyphenol oxidases  are ubiquitous in higher plants and are the major cause for tissue browning due to oxidization of phenolic substrates. ppos have been suggested to have a role in defense against insects and plant pathogens, but they may also be activated by mechanical stress. a ppo homolog encoded by aureusidin synthase has been shown to function in flower coloration  <cit> .

transcription factor genes showing differential expression at stages  <dig> and 6
since transcription factors widely regulate many aspects of development, we examined these genes more closely. in addition to the statistical criteria  we used a fold change threshold of >  <dig>  for differentially expressed transcripts. as described earlier, at stage  <dig>  only the mads-box gene grcd <dig> was detected to have greater expression in ray flowers as compared with the corresponding stage in disc flowers. in both flower types, most of the differentially expressed transcription related genes were expressed during stages  <dig> and  <dig>  and moreover, they showed stage-specific expression . especially prominent was the upregulation of several homeotic mads-box genes that are known to regulate flower development .

in addition to mads-box genes, we identified one gene differentially expressed in disc flowers at stage  <dig> encoding a putative ring zinc finger protein. ring and variant-ring domain proteins are widespread in plants, and as parts of multiprotein complexes they are involved in diverse cellular functions, e.g., ubiquitination pathways  <cit> . two gerbera homeobox hd-zip factor genes upregulated in disc flowers shared high sequence similarity with a xylem-specific zinnia elegans gene  <cit>  as well as with arabidopsis revoluta  and corona  genes, both members of the hd-zip iii gene family  <cit> . hd-zip iii genes play numerous roles in development, including embryo patterning, vascular development, leaf development  as well as meristem initiation  <cit> . the gerbera est database currently includes four clusters of genes that are homologous with squamosa promoter binding proteins  and squamosa promoter binding like  proteins. two of these were upregulated in disc flowers at stage  <dig>  in arabidopsis, spl <dig> has been shown to be involved in floral transition  <cit>  and spl <dig> in pollen sac development  <cit>  but functions for the other  <dig> spl genes remain largely unknown. we also identified two genes encoding yabby transcription factors . together with kanadi genes, the yabby gene family promotes abaxial identity of organs  <cit> . in addition, several transcription factors related to regulation of transcription initiation, chromatin assembly, and mrna processing were upregulated in disc flowers.

in ray flower primordia,  <dig> genes were differentially upregulated . many of the transcription factors therein belong to different classes of zinc-finger proteins  <cit> . blast searches indicated that g0000100020b <dig> and g0000600011g <dig> are homologous with putative flowering-time genes identified in maize  and arabidopsis . the functional role for the gata <dig> zinc-finger-like protein g0000500013b <dig> is not known as yet. we also identified a lim domain protein homolog upregulated in ray flowers at stage  <dig>  we have previously observed that plim <dig>  <cit>  was more than 8-fold upregulated during late stages of stamen development. nevertheless, multiple functions have been shown for lim domain proteins in plants, including transcriptional regulation in the nucleus  <cit> . finally, at stage  <dig>  we detected upregulation of the bhlh factor encoded by g0000600012d <dig>  previously isolated as gmyc <dig> and involved in anthocyanin regulation in gerbera  <cit> .

several mads-box genes show differential expression during ray and disc flower development
several previously characterized gerbera mads-box genes  showed differential expression during the early stages of ray and disc flower differentiation . gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> are c-function genes known to be involved in regulation of stamen and carpel identity in gerbera  <cit> . gdef <dig> shares high sequence similarity with gdef <dig>  another b-function gene in gerbera, but it groups phylogenetically with tm6-like genes of the b-class lineage  <cit> . its function during gerbera flower development has not yet been established  <cit> . grcd <dig> is required for carpel identity, but the gene also controls maintenance of flower meristem identity as well as inflorescence determinacy  <cit> . all of the aforementioned genes are upregulated in bisexual disc flowers in comparison to female ray flowers. phep7f <dig> encodes the squamosa-like gene gsqua <dig>  <cit> , and g0000800002c <dig>  also upregulated in disc flowers, encodes a mads-box gene homologous to chrysanthemum cdm <dig>  which belongs to the fruitfull clade  <cit> .

in ray flowers, grcd <dig>  which was more expressed already at stage  <dig>  was similarly upregulated at stage  <dig>  in addition to grcd <dig>  another mads-box gene, g0000100021a <dig>  showed greater expression in ray flowers at stage  <dig>  g0000100021a <dig>  is a tm3-like mads-box gene that showed late petal-specific expression in our previous microarray analyses  <cit> . g0000700003a <dig> , which was significantly more expressed in ray flowers, groups phylogenetically close to the previously identified gerbera gene grcd <dig> as well as arabidopsis sepallata <dig> . grcd <dig> shares highest sequence similarity with the cdm <dig> mads-box gene from chrysanthemum and fbp <dig> of petunia  <cit> . in fact, grcd <dig> appears to be orthologous to cdm <dig> in phylogenetic analysis . according to the same phylogenetic analysis , g0000200014a <dig> , which is transcriptionally abundant in ray flowers, lies in the agl <dig> clade  <cit> , grouping close together with agl <dig>  mdmads <dig>  and zag <dig> and zag <dig> . g0000200001c <dig> shows sequence similarity to the chrysanthemum cdm <dig> and gerbera g0000500017f <dig> mads-box genes, the latter of which has a leaf specific expression pattern  <cit>  similar to arabidopsis agamous-like mads-box protein agl <dig>  we observed similar expression patterns for the gerbera mads-box genes using real time reverse transcriptase pcr .

co-expression of mads-box genes during flower development in gerbera
mads domain proteins form specific homo- and heterodimers and even higher order complexes to conduct their function  <cit> . specific interactions among mads domain proteins require that they are present in the same cells and tissues under the same developmental stages, and correspondingly, it has been shown that transcripts with overlapping expression patterns are preferred as protein interaction partners  <cit> . in order to strengthen our observations above and to reveal coordinated expression patterns for gerbera mads-box genes, we combined our present observations with our previous analyses  <cit> . in an independent analysis we looked for genes that were differentially regulated along with gaga <dig> and grcd <dig>  gaga <dig> was chosen because it was differentially expressed in disc flowers at both stages  <dig> and  <dig>  and grcd <dig> due to its early upregulation in ray flowers at stage  <dig> . previously  <cit> , we used the gerbera cdna microarray to identify inflorescence-specific genes in comparison to leaf tissue as well as genes specific for individual reproductive organs and stages . the samples represented relatively late stages of flower organ development in contrast to the early stages of flower primordium development analyzed here. standard correlation was used to find transcription factors whose expression correlated  with gaga <dig> or grcd <dig> across all nine conditions . table  <dig> summarizes the identified genes.

the first set of genes represents those that are co-expressed with the c-class gene gaga <dig>  which was the only mads-box gene showing significant change in expression in both stages  <dig> and  <dig> . across all nine conditions included in the analysis,  <dig> genes showed an expression pattern similar to gaga <dig>  the highest correlation  was observed for grcd <dig>  the product of which was previously demonstrated to interact with gaga <dig> using yeast two hybrid analysis  <cit> . furthermore, the second gerbera c-function gene, gaga <dig>  as well as the b-function genes gglo <dig> and gdef <dig>  were co-expressed with gaga <dig>  gglo <dig>  a b-function gene orthologous to arabidopsis pistillata required for petal and stamen identity  <cit> . also showed disc-flower specific expression at stages  <dig> and  <dig> in microarray . this result was verified using real time rt-pcr  and northern blotting . the functionally unknown tm6-like gene gdef <dig>  the sepallata-like gene grcd <dig>  and gsqua <dig> were also included among the gaga1-coexpressed group of genes. in addition to mads-box genes, several other co-expressed transcription factor genes were identified including those encoding squamosa binding protein like homolog  <dig>  two zinc finger proteins and an myb domain factor similar to antirrhinum myb <dig>  an early regulator of the phenylpropanoid pathway.

grcd <dig>  which is already strongly upregulated in ray flowers at stage  <dig>  continuing to stage  <dig>  is co-expressed with the tm3-like mads-box gene g0000100021a <dig> in all nine conditions . two sepallata-like genes also showed a highly correlated expression pattern. furthermore, we identified a co-expressed gene encoding a myb domain transcription factor similar to pisum myb <dig>  <cit>  a pollen specific lim domain and a nam-like protein.

discussion
nearly nothing is known about genetic mechanisms involved in flower-type specification, neither in asteraceae nor in any other plant bearing heteromorphic flowers within a single genotype. we have defined the early stages of ray and disc flower development in gerbera hybrida and have shown that although flower development initiates similarly in both flower types, differences in petal and stamen development can be identified at relatively young stages of inflorescence development. the large size of gerbera inflorescences as well as the presence of hundreds of coordinately developing flowers permitted us to microdissect individual flower primordia for rna isolation and to compare gene expression during early stages of development. in general, we did not identify genes constitutively expressed throughout the chosen developmental stages, indicating that rapid transcriptional changes occur during very early stages of gerbera ray and disc flower development. the number of differentially expressed genes in our microarray comparisons increased dramatically with developmental time, which correlates with morphological differentiation as shown with sem and histological analyses.

in our experiments we focused particularly on transcription factors that were differentially expressed in ray and disc flower primordia. typical for disc flowers was the high number of genes putatively involved in mrna processing and transcriptional regulation. we also identified several squamosa promoter binding protein homologs, the functions of which are still largely unknown even in arabidopsis. hd-zip iii type transcription factor genes similar to revoluta were also upregulated in disc flowers. there are five genes encoding hd-zip iii factors in arabidopsis, revoluta, phavoluta, phabulosa, corona, and athb <dig>  during embryogenesis, arabidopsis hd-zip iii triple mutants fail to distinguish the central domain from the peripheral domain of the developing embryo, which leads to formation of a single, radially symmetric cotyledon  <cit> . given this potential role in normally occurring asymmetry, it is tempting to speculate that the identified gerbera hd-zip iii factors could function in regulation of symmetry at the inflorescence level. in ray flowers the most prominent group of upregulated transcription factor genes encode mads-box regulatory proteins.

differences in stamen and petal development
clear morphological differences between the flower types in stamen and petal development  that begin at stage  <dig> probably reflect differences in cell division and elongation as well as in organ fusion. the most prominent difference is the arrest of stamen development in ray flowers. as also observed in gerbera, a common mechanism for generating unisexual flowers is the selective developmental arrest of either female or male organ primordia, which may occur at different stages of development in different species  <cit> . the most fundamental genes discriminating the sexes in flowering plants are the homeotic b- and c-class genes, which distinguish between carpel and stamen development  <cit> . based on the abc model of flower development, stamen identity is determined by activity of both b- and c-class mads-box genes, while the activity of c-class genes alone controls carpel development  <cit> . however, several studies in eudicot species have failed to provide unambiguous support for a hypothesis that development of unisexual flowers would involve alterations in the expression patterns of the b- or c-function genes, which indicates that the genetic mechanisms in sex determination must act downstream of organ identity  <cit> . in gerbera as well, alterations in b- and c-class mads-box gene expression are not likely the cause of arrested stamen development in ray flowers. our results suggest that the role of the sep-like gene grcd <dig>  highly upregulated in ray flowers, could be related to the flower-type specific arrest of stamen development. in ray flowers of transgenic plants in which grcd <dig> expression was downregulated, sterile staminodes were converted into anthocyanin pigmented petals. however, stamen development was only slightly affected in bisexual disc flowers, where fertile pollen was produced although not released  <cit> . altogether, these results suggest that the arrest of stamen development is connected to organ identity that is differentially established in ray versus disc flowers. we propose that whorl  <dig> organ identity establishment involves grcd <dig> function, but only in ray flowers.

differential expression of genes encoding mads domain transcription factors – flower-type specific regulatory complexes
the microarray data, as supported by real time rt-pcr, suggest that mads-box proteins may be involved in specific complexes required for the differentiation of individual flower types during inflorescence development in asteraceae. differential gene expression of several gerbera mads-box genes  had earlier been detected with northern blots representing the same floral developmental stages used in this study . the quantitative differences we observed at the gene expression level may reflect later qualitative protein-protein interaction differences and thereby the composition of specific protein complexes involved in regulation of organ identity in different flower types. because our expression data revealed genes whose expression is correlated both spatially and temporally in various gerbera tissues, we are able to hypothesize specific protein-protein interactions, some of which have already been confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays or are supported by transgenic phenotypes. a comprehensive interaction analysis of arabidopsis mads-box factors has shown that almost 100% of the interacting proteins have an overlap in expression pattern  <cit> . coexpression can be taken as an indication for possible in planta interaction  <cit> . furthermore, we have identified differential expression of new sep-like genes, which in gerbera and other plants show a diversity of functions beyond those described for arabidopsis  <cit> . figure  <dig> summarizes our current view of gerbera organ-identity genes, indicating  specific factors that have shown flower-type specific effects in transgenic plants  <cit> .

upregulation of b- and c-class mads-box genes as well as the sep-like gene grcd <dig> in central disc flowers probably reflects the major role these genes play in determining normal stamen and carpel identity . in transgenic plants, suppression of b , c  or grcd <dig> function caused similar phenotypes in both flower types  <cit> . interestingly, the expression of gsqua <dig> and the sep-like gene grcd <dig> correlated with b- and c-class gene expression. despite its sequence similarity to arabidopsis apetala <dig>  gsqua <dig> is probably not involved in establishing the a function since its expression was detected at the base of developing flowers, in petals, and in developing vascular bundles of the capitulum  <cit> . however, grcd <dig> was also upregulated during late petal development in our previous microarray studies  <cit> , suggesting that it, together with b and c function genes, may encode a petal-specific sep gene in gerbera. the function of gdef <dig>  a tm6-like b-class gene upregulated in disc flowers, is less clear. unlike gdef <dig>  which is strongly expressed in both petals and stamens, gdef <dig> is most highly expressed in stamens  indicating function in stamen development. a highly similar gene in petunia  also showed stamen expression and strong protein-protein interaction with the petunia phglo <dig> polypeptide  <cit> . in gerbera, yeast two-hybrid results show that both gdef <dig> and gdef <dig> form heterodimers with the b function protein gglo <dig> , whereas neither protein interacts with grcd <dig>  the function of which is carpel-specific  <cit> . grcd <dig> and the tm3-like gene g0000100021a <dig> are both highly upregulated in ray flowers. this suggests that these two genes may encode interacting proteins involved in the arrest of stamen development. moreover, the expression of grcd <dig> and g0000100021a <dig> correlated at the flower organ level across all nine conditions analyzed, suggesting that they may have additional functional roles, e.g., during petal development. specific upregulation phenomena in disc versus ray flowers are summarized in figure  <dig> below the arrow, the direction of which follows the capitulum radius.

mads protein complexes and a radial morphogenetic gradient
the capitulum of the asteraceae has been used historically as a model to study inflorescence meristem development. inflorescence determination and phyllotaxis have been investigated through wounding experiments, and flower-type specific organ development has been analyzed genetically. both lines of research have suggested the action of a radial morphogenetic gradient in capitulum development. cylindrical wounding of early sunflower inflorescences to produce isolated plugs of capitulum receptacle tissue resulted in the development of complete, miniature capitula embedded within larger capitula  <cit> . thus, the radially organized sunflower receptacle can be reset into further radially patterned zones via disruption of cell-cell communication. genetic studies of reproductive characters in microseris also suggest cell-cell communication radially. the hairy and yellow achene  traits both show concentric localization in microseris capitula, although they are independently regulated  <cit> . in the strains examined, hairy achenes  are always peripheral to smooth achenes, and there is a region of overlap  in which individual cells appear to respond specifically to a defining gradient. the yellow-achenes trait also shows radial zonation, the extent of which differs among microseris strains segregating for two yellow-achenes alleles. bachmann and colleagues  <cit>  have hypothesized that the genes responsible for peripheral hairy achenes are participants in the establishment of a radial morphogenetic gradient, and that the alleles of yellow-achenes have different response thresholds for this gradient.

morphogenetic gradients with distinct patterning effects, such as production of ray and trans versus disc flowers in gerbera, can be set up by simple threshold models of short range activation and long range inhibition, so long as the feedback loops are non-linear  <cit> . an example of a non-linear relationship is an inhibited activator protein that must function as a dimer. mads domain proteins form specific homo- and heterodimers and even higher-order complexes to conduct their function  <cit> . the long range  inhibitor could be a diffusible small molecular weight compound, but it has also been demonstrated that plant transcription factor proteins, including the antirrhinum mads domain factors def and glo themselves, can move through plasmodesmata and act non-cell-autonomously  <cit> . production of mads multimers would add significantly to the possible responses to a morphogenetic gradient. in summary, the mads protein system can provide a simple numerical scaffold  upon which to generate great cell, tissue, and organ diversity through differential regulation along a radius. this is well presented in development of the whorled structure of single floral meristems, but by extension, the same general radial gradient mechanisms might operate at the inflorescence level, as suggested by previous work on sunflower and microseris. since we have discovered that different mads domain proteins are differentially expressed in ray versus disc flowers of gerbera , we hypothesize that developmental control of the asteraceae capitulum may be more than a simple analog of the single flower that it resembles. comparative flower/inflorescence research on mads-box gene transcriptional responses to candidate gradient-establishing molecules, as well as studies of in vivo protein-protein interactions, could help test this hypothesis. if corroborated, it will remain to be demonstrated whether gerbera capitula may have acquired flower-like developmental regulation secondarily, or whether their condensed structure makes a more general pattern easier to detect.

CONCLUSIONS
very little is known about the genetic mechanisms involved in flower type differentiation in asteraceae. we have taken advantage of the large size of gerbera inflorescences to morphologicaly characterize developing ray and disc flower primordia. although the development of individual flower types initiates similarly, differences in petal and stamen development are observed at relatively early stages. global gene expression analyses using the gerbera cdna microarray indicate that rapid transcriptional changes correlate with morphological differentiation of dividual flower types. most interestingly, we identified several genes encoding mads domain transcription factors that are differentially expressed in developing ray and disc flower primordia. we hypothesize that the quantitative and qualitative expression differences discovered reflect control by a radial morphogenetic gradient across the capitulum that may lead to formation of specific mads protein complexes that regulate the differentiation of individual flower types. based on coexpression, we propose functional hypotheses for several mads-box transcription factors that will be further tested in protein-protein interaction studies and using transgenic gerbera plants.
