BACKGROUND
the phylum porifera  is currently divided into three extant classes – the hexactinellida, demospongiae, and calcarea – and one fossil class – the archaeocyatha  <cit> . hexactinellids differ from the canonical sponge body plan in lacking discrete motile cells . the tissue of hexactinellids forms a continuous multinucleate syncytium. cellular components exist, but all "cells" are connected by cytoplasmic bridges to one-another and to the syncytium. choanocytes are branched; collar-flagella units  form as enucleate buds, several arising from a single nucleated choanoblast  <cit> . the distinct tissue organization was considered important enough to warrant separation of hexactinellids from other porifera at the subphylum level – symplasma for the hexactinellida and cellularia for the demospongiae and calcarea  <cit> . in no other animal is the tissue so inclusively connected in a giant syncytium, making the hexactinellid body construction unique among porifera, as well as all metazoa.

the porifera has long been considered the earliest branching group of the metazoan crown, based on both morphological and molecular evidence, although the precise relationships of the lower metazoan phyla remains uncertain  <cit> . one on-going approach to resolve the overall metazoan phylogeny, as well as the problematic class-level relationships among the sponges, has been comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes . to date, this effort has seen the sequencing and description of five complete demosponge mtdnas , and most recently, that of two partial hexactinellid sponge mtdnas . phylogenetic estimations based on concatenated mitochondrial protein sequences have been sensitive to taxon sampling, outgroup choice and algorithm implementation. these trees reveal artifacts likely due to variable rates of molecular evolution, such that placozoans, cnidarians, and demosponges are recovered as a monophyletic clade, with hexactinellids the sister group of bilaterians  <cit> . the tree topologies may become more stable, and consistent with plausible hypotheses of the evolution of morphological traits, as the mtdna of additional taxa are added to the data set.

while sequence-based mtdna comparisons of the lower metazoa have not been phylogenetically definitive, the efforts have dispelled some commonly held myths and revealed some general characteristics of animal mtdna. placozoan mtdna, for example, is twice as large as most animal molecules, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kilobases, and retains various traits of the non-metazoan outgroups such as substantial intergenic space, introns and large open reading frames less commonly found in other animal mtdna  <cit> . on the other hand, demosponge mtdna is more typical of other animals – compact molecules, between  <dig> and  <dig> kb, with few or no introns, little intergenic space, and coding for twelve to fourteen respiratory chain proteins and two ribosomal rnas  <cit> . two partial hexactinellid mitochondrial genomes, those of sympagella nux  and iphiteon panicea , have recently been reported  <cit> . these genomes were found to have similar protein-coding gene content as the published demosponges, but had several features such as trna structure and content more similar to that of bilaterians  <cit> . the current paper reports on the complete mtdna sequence of the hexactinellid sponge aphrocallistes vastus , compares it to previously published poriferan mtdnas, and highlights two translational frameshifts, a phenomenon that is unique to the hexactinellids among reported lower metazoan mitochondrial genomes.

RESULTS
gene content
the complete mitochondrial genome of aphrocallistes vastus was sequenced and shown to be a  <dig>  base pair circular molecule encoding  <dig> proteins,  <dig> ribosomal rna subunits, and  <dig> trnas  . all genes were found to be coded on the same strand. the protein coding genes included  <dig> of the respiratory genes  common to most animal mtdna, as well as the atp synthase f <dig> subunit <dig>  found in all published sponge mitochondrial genomes except for amphimedon  <cit> . a  <dig> bp open reading frame  of unknown identity and function was located adjacent to the largest,  <dig> bp, intergenic space , just downstream of the nad <dig> + trnh + nad <dig> + trng genes . orf <dig> does not display significant nucleotide or amino acid similarity to either of the unknown orfs in the i. panicea mtdna. is <dig> contains numerous direct repeats and may comprise a control region that includes the origin of replication. a putative control region was inferred in the mitochondrial genome of amphimedon as well  <cit> .

t uses the tag stop codon, while those without notation all use taa.

# the predicted trnf gene lies entirely within the nad <dig> orf.

*the gene length includes both reading frames inferred to constitute the protein.

**the start and stop positions of the ribosomal rnas were predicted based on conserved multiple alignment positions and the borders with neighboring genes.

the beginnings and ends of the small and large rrna subunits,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively, were approximated from alignment data as these genes retained little sequence similarity to the rrnas from sequenced demosponge mtdnas, or with those in the non-redundant blast database. thus the complete rrna sequences remain to be confirmed experimentally. the a. vastus rrnas were similar to the predicted rrnas of i. panicea and s. nux, and the rnl sequence was highly similar to the partial 16s rrna from the hexactinellid heterochone calyx , indicating that these genes are similar within the hexactinellids but divergent from those of other sponge classes. whereas the first three published sponge mtdnas, all of closely related demosponges, presented a picture of highly similar, conserved molecules  <cit> , additional demosponge and hexactinellid mtdnas have since revealed that some sponge mtdnas have unknown orfs, genes on the complement strand , and divergent gene sequences  <cit> .

the trna complement of a. vastus,  <dig> genes predicted by trnascan-se and confirmed by blast similarity searches  <cit> , was much reduced compared to that of demosponges, and even sparser than the other reported hexactinellids, which had  <dig> and  <dig> trnas  <cit> . it included  <dig> isoacceptors for serine, trnser and trnser, while three trnas are missing entirely: trnd, trne, and trnt . a reduction in mitochondrial encoded trnas, therefore, represents a polyphyletic characteristic between lower metazoan groups, found most extremely among cnidarians which have lost nearly all of their mtdna encoded trnas  <cit> . the structure of the a. vastus trns <dig>  predicted by trnascan-se, reveals a dhu arm with a uniquely truncated d-loop, a feature distinct from the novel trns genes in i. panicea and s. nux, which have a loop in place of a dhu arm, reminiscent of bilaterian trnas . the remaining a. vastus trnas display traits similar to those of the other hexactinellids – namely polymorphic dhu and tψc arms, and loss of the canonical guanine bases in the dhu loop. numerous trnas  have mismatches in their acceptor arm, as well as in their anticodon arm  and t-arm  , a common feature in higher animal mitochondrial trnas that is corrected through rna editing  <cit> .

genome organization, nucleotide composition and codon usage
the organization of the a. vastus mtdna was quite compact, typical of sponges and most other animals. nearly 72% of the mtdna was predicted to encode proteins , 22% to encode ribosomal and transfer rnas, while only 6% was non-coding intergenic space. almost 52% of the intergenic space was comprised of the predicted control region, is <dig> . furthermore, there were eight examples of overlapping genes, including one remarkable instance in which the trnf gene was found entirely contained within the nad <dig> open reading frame . four of the eight gene overlaps involve the nad2-nad <dig> gene block, indicating that this region has experienced a higher rate of compaction than other parts of the mtdna.

nucleotide composition of a. vastus was found to be similar to that of the reported hexactinellids in terms of a-t richness and nucleotide skew, as was its codon usage. the a. vastus mtdna was calculated to be  <dig> % a+t, nearly identical to that of s. nux . the at skew /) and gc skew /) for the coding strand of a. vastus were  <dig>  and - <dig> , again nearly identical to those of s. nux . while the skew metrics were quite similar among the hexactinellids, they ran counter to the compositional preferences of the demosponges, which display negative at and positive gc skews. all three known hexactinellids share a reassignment of agr codons from ariginine to serine . this change is not seen in the demosponges or in other lower metazoan taxa, but rather is known only from select bilaterian groups. the mtdna of a. vastus, like the other glass sponges, encodes only a trni but heavily favors the aua codon to code for isoleucine . it should be noted that the a. vastus mtdna was found to lack several trnas, specifically for the amino acids aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and threonine, and thus must import some nuclear-derived trnas to complete translation.

for each sponge species with a published mtdna, the number of occurrences in protein coding sequence is given of codons with exceptional usage . the hexactinellid sponges strongly favor ile despite coding for a trna with  specificity. agr codons  are reassigned from arginine to serine in the glass sponges. the hexactinellids rarely if ever employ the trp codon for translation, but rather seem to use it as a signal for programmed frameshifting.

regions of synteny and unique transpositions among the hexactinellids
the largest block of genes shared between a. vastus and the previously published hexactinellid sponge mtdnas consisted of atp6-cox3-nad2-nad5-trnf-trnc-nad1-trn-cob. aphrocallistes contained trni, n, and y between nad <dig> and cob, while i. panicea had trnl and trny, and s. nux retained the entire complement trnl, i, n, and y. this region of synteny spanned  <dig>  bp of the a. vastus mtdna, or 41% of the genome . aphrocallistes and i. panicea shared the cox2-rnl gene border, while in s. nux these genes were shuffled to rnl-cox <dig>  with respect to hexactinellids, nad <dig> has transposed in the a. vastus mtdna, adjacent to cox <dig>  whereas it is adjacent to trnas and nad4l in i. panicea and s. nux. in a. vastus and i. panicea, nad <dig> and nad <dig> are adjacent but found in the opposite order. while nad <dig> has not been found in the sequenced portion of the s. nux mtdna, the gap in the genome lies upstream of nad <dig>  if nad <dig> is found in this gap upon completion of the s. nux mtdna sequence, s. nux would share the nad4-nad <dig> boundary with a. vastus .

the mtdna gene segment cox2-atp8-atp6-cox <dig> is a highly conserved syntenic region found in arthropods, echinoderms, chordates, and other higher animal groups  <cit> . in the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis the order of these four genes relative to one another is conserved, though the genes are not found as a contiguous block  <cit> . placozoan mtdna does not contain this synteny  <cit> , but it is present in all known demosponges except o. carmela   <cit> . the synteny is also found in several described mtdnas of octocorallians  <cit> . demosponges appear to be the most basal animal group to retain this plesiomorphy, as the hexactinellids have lost atp <dig> and translocated cox <dig> . all sponge mtdnas sequenced to date revealed a highly conserved synteny between the nad2-nad <dig> gene block. meanwhile, the cox1-trna-nad <dig> region shared among the demosponges, including o. carmela, was not found in any of the hexactinellid mtdnas . recall that nad <dig> was part of the large hexactinellid-specific synteny described above.

translational frameshifting in cox <dig> and nad6
aphrocallistes cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes were found to contain a + <dig> translational frameshift at amino acid position  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in both cases, the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by the cox <dig> and nad <dig> open reading frames prior to this frameshift was highly similar to the n-terminal portion of diverse metazoan homologs. coincident with the + <dig> frameshift in these genes, the predicted amino acid sequence in frame  <dig> encoded the remaining c-terminal portion of these proteins based on multiple alignments to poriferan, diploblast and bilaterian homologs . the frameshift occurred precisely at the codon ugg  for both genes. the ugg codon has been suggested to play a role in translational frameshifting in the other reported hexactinellids, albeit in different genes than in a. vastus  <cit> . the amino acid tryptophan was found in  <dig> other positions in the predicted a. vastus mtdna proteome, each time coded for by uga . the only two instances of the ugg codon appeared precisely at the frameshifts in cox <dig> and nad <dig>  moreover, the frame  <dig> tryptophan is replaced by a highly conserved frame  <dig> glycine that is found in all taxa in the alignment. numerous other widely shared residues followed the glycine in frame  <dig> .

one possibility is that the frameshift goes uncorrected and that functional proteins are encoded by nuclear copies of the genes. if this were the case, one would expect these mitochondrial genes to have diverged under relaxed selective pressure. the multiple alignment shows, however, that the amino acid sequences on both sides of the frameshift have retained strong similarity to closely and distantly related homologs . a second possibility is the frameshifts were corrected by rna editing, as is commonly seen in the mtdna of plants, fungi, and protists  <cit> . to test this possibility, a randomly primed cdna pool was screened by pcr with cox <dig> and nad <dig> gene specific primers flanking the ugg codon. the amplified cdna fragments from several independent pcr reactions were sequenced. the results  showed that all cdna products contained the frameshift,  demonstrating that the mitochondrial genes are expressed, and  ruling out the possibility of an rna editing mechanism to restore the cox <dig> and nad <dig> reading frames.

yet another possibility is that the frameshift was corrected by translational frameshifting. a mechanism for + <dig> programmed translational frameshifting has been described in saccharomyces cerevisaie  <cit>  and reported in disparate bilaterian animal groups  <cit> . the phenomenon occurs in three steps: first, the ribosomal p site-bound peptidyl-trna forms a "weak wobble interaction" with the gene transcript; second, translation halts because the next required trna is so rare that its codon is not readily recognized; and lastly, an abundant aminoacyl-trna of the + <dig> codon forces the ribosomal complex to shift frames  <cit> . this scenario can be readily applied to the a. vastus cox <dig> and nad <dig> genes. we hypothesize that translation pauses due to poor recognition of the highly unusual ugg tryptophan codon, allowing an abundant trnagly to induce the + <dig> frameshift. this hypothesis begs many questions. for example: how efficient is the mechanism of frameshift correction? if the frameshift lowers the translation efficiency of the affected genes, why has selection allowed a frameshift to persist? has this mechanism evolved convergently in each disparate taxa, or is it a shared but rarely employed tool available to any animal whenever a frameshift becomes fixed in the mitochondrial genome?

CONCLUSIONS
the few sequenced hexactinellid sponge mtdnas contain a suite of shared traits, including the loss of the gene atp <dig>  retention of the gene atp <dig>  highly divergent ribosomal rnas, and reduction of their trna complements. hexactinellid nucleotide composition is distinct from that of demosponges, favoring adenine over thymine and cytosine over guanine on the coding strand. the hexactinellid mtdnas share a large region of synteny spanning the atp <dig> to cob genes, but a syntenty putatively ancestral to the metazoa, cox2-atp8-atp6-cox <dig>  is not retained. perhaps the most unique feature of hexactinellid mitochondrial genomes is the predicted + <dig> programmed translational frameshifting initiated by ribosomal pausing at the extremely rare ugg  codon. future mtdna sampling will reveal whether this phenomenon is common to yet more glass sponges or the other sponge classes.
