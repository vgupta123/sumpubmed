BACKGROUND
the synaptic actions of dopamine  in the striatal complex, the principal target of da neurons in the cns, may best be described as heterogeneous. in the striatal complex, da neurons synapse on and in proximity to medium-spiny gaba neurons  <cit> . medium-spiny neurons  constitute 95% of the neurons in the area  <cit> , receive feed-forward gabaergic inhibition from fast spiking interneurons  <cit> , and extensive excitatory input from cortex and thalamus, and in the case of msns in the ventral striatal complex, or nucleus accumbens , also from the amygdala and hippocampus  <cit> . msns give rise to a profusion of local axon collaterals that ramify within the dendritic fields of the parent cell  <cit> , as well as to all the efferent projections from the striatal complex  <cit> . since evoked gabaergic inputs are dominated by the small population of fast-spiking interneurons  <cit> , discerning the function of msn-to-msn synapses proved challenging  <cit> . recently, dual intracellular recordings in striatal slices  <cit>  and paired whole-cell recordings both in explant cultures  <cit>  and slices  <cit>  have shown that msn-to-msn synapses function. although the synapses appear to be weak, in numbers they account for two thirds of the gabaergic inputs to a given msn neuron  <cit> , so on a network level their function is likely to be quite significant  <cit> . the argument can be made that these synapses are a major target of da action. indeed, they show potent da modulation via presynaptic d1-like receptors mediating facilitation and d2-like receptors mediating inhibition  <cit> .

the cellular and subcellular distribution of da receptors on individual msns – a critical determinant of da action – has been the subject of considerable debate  <cit> . part of the controversy devolves to making the distinction between the molecular biology and the pharmacology. pharmacologically identified d1-like receptors comprise d <dig> and d <dig> receptors; d2-like receptors comprise d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig> receptors  <cit> . initial in situ hybridization studies reported the segregation of d <dig> and d <dig> receptors to different populations of msns  <cit> , and this was amply confirmed in single cell rt-pcr studies  <cit> , and in expression patterns revealed in d <dig> and d <dig> bac transgenics  <cit> . d <dig> receptor expressing msns contain substancep and project to the ventral midbrain  where they show robust d1-mediated presynaptic facilitation  <cit> . d <dig> receptor expressing msns contain enkephalin and project to the ventral pallidum  where they show d2-mediated presynaptic inhibition  <cit> .

while single-cell rt-pcr studies confirmed the lack of d1/d <dig> receptor colocalization in msns, they also showed about a 50% colocalization of d1-like and d2-like receptors  <cit> . this was confirmed in double-label fluoroprobe studies of msns in culture  <cit> , where receptors were identified pharmacologically. other studies stand in further counterpoint to these results. in acutely dissociated striatal neurons, biochemical measures of da modulation indicated near complete d1/d <dig> overlap  <cit> . confocal immunocytochemical studies with d <dig> and d <dig> receptor-selective antisera reported near complete d1/d <dig> colocalization on msns identified by darpp- <dig> expression  <cit> . while d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are differentially distributed on the two classes of msns, accounting for the segregation seen in the in situ studies, expression of the other da receptors, together with lower levels of receptor expression that may be functionally significant, argue against a strict segregationist view at the functional, i.e. pharmacological level.

the strict segregationist view has been further confounded by single-cell, axon-tracing studies that have shown that there are no direct axonal projections from the striatum to the ventral midbrain. rather, all msns project to the pallidum, with about a third terminating there, and the remaining two thirds going on to the entopeduncular nucleus and the ventral midbrain  <cit> . this anatomy is consistent with physiological studies, in which msn-to-msn connections were activated by antidromic activation from the ventral pallidum. this showed that substance p-containing neurons are subject to d <dig> modulation at their projection synapses and d <dig> modulation at their local synapses , while enkephalin-containing neurons are subject to d <dig> modulation at their projection synapses and d <dig> modulation at their local synapses  <cit> .

while the consensus is that there is about a 50% overlap in d1- and d2-like da receptor expression at the cell body level, the projection synapses of msns show either d <dig> or d <dig> pharmacology. surmeier et al.  <cit> , in a prescient review, suggested the possibility that da receptors might be trafficked differentially into the axons of individual msns, accounting for the differences seen between local da actions reported in the striatum  and distal actions on msn projection synapses. to examine da modulation of individual msn-to-msn synapses, and to address the hypothesis that da receptors show differential trafficking, we used postnatal cell culture to gain access to individual, identified msn synapses. we have found that there is significant presynaptic da modulation. moreover it is heterogeneous, consistent with differential trafficking of da receptors to different presynaptic varicosities in single neurons. part of this work has appeared previously in abstract form  <cit> .

RESULTS
gabaergic connections of medium-spiny neurons in vitro
in postnatal cultures made from the nucleus accumbens, the ventral component of the striatal complex, 95% of the neurons are medium-sized, gabaergic  <cit> , and bear dendritic spines  <cit> , serving to identify them as the predominant msn population. the gabaa antagonists bicuculline  or gabazine   <cit>  invariably inhibited the synaptic actions of these neurons, confirming their identification as msns. we present data from  <dig> msns , in which cells remained healthy throughout the experiment, with small, stable leak currents, and in which there was satisfactory drug perfusion . input resistances measured  <dig> ±  <dig> mΩ .

stimulating cells with a brief depolarizing command  evoked unclamped axon spikes that produced autaptic ipscs with a rise time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  msec and amplitude of  <dig> ±  <dig> na  . stimulation of neighboring medium-sized cell bodies with a loose patch electrode evoked ipscs with a rise time of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  msec and amplitude  <dig> ±  <dig> na  . both the rise times  and the amplitudes  were significantly different. this would suggest that the faster, stronger synaptic inputs were more proximally distributed than the slower, weaker autaptic inputs. autaptic ipscs typically ran down over the course of 10– <dig> minutes and then stabilized at a plateau of reduced amplitude, while synaptic responses did not run down . this would argue that washout affected mainly presynaptic mechanisms . nonetheless, we focused on autaptic responses, because they provided access to single identified msn-to-msn synapses. we never saw failures, even when responses had diminished, so the recorded ipscs reflect the activation of multiple release sites.

da modulation
da modulated msn-to-msn connections, both autaptic and synaptic responses . we measured da modulation as the fraction of the preceding control response, to normalize for the decrease in ipsc amplitude over the course of experiments. however, even when the response had plateaued at a diminished level, da modulation persisted. da inhibited autaptic responses in the majority of experiments; in the others, it had no effect or facilitated responses . the d <dig> agonist skf <dig> and the d <dig> agonist quinpirole both showed a similar picture, with inhibition predominating. d <dig> activation produced slightly more facilitation. while the agonists mimicked da action, they generally did not produce as robust modulation, even when applied together at equimolar concentrations to da.

tests for pharmacological specificity were confounded by the fact that the antagonists at higher concentrations inhibited autaptic responses. to obtain larger and more stable responses for these experiments, we used a high-chloride intracellular solution, which flipped the ipscs, but did not appreciably alter the da modulation. we found that sch <dig> at  <dig> μm produced a complete blockade , probably due to a direct inhibition of ca2+ currents  <cit> . sch <dig> at  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm had a slight  inhibitory effect on autaptic responses, but completely blocked da actions . similarly, the d <dig> antagonist sulpiride inhibited  autaptic responses at  <dig> μm; at  <dig> μm it had only a modest or no effect on autaptic responses . applied together , however, these concentrations of sch <dig> and sulpiride completely blocked da modulation of autaptic responses , arguing that the modulatory effects were mediated by da receptors. da in the presence of the d <dig> receptor antagonist sch <dig> had a similar incidence and efficacy as quinpirole ; similarly, da in the presence of the d <dig> antagonist sulpiride  resembled skf <dig> . overall, about 85% of cells that responded to da showed both d1- and d2-mediated modulation, consistent with extensive colocalization of da receptors on msn presynaptic varicosities, or at least arguing that d1- and d2-like receptors are both present on the varicosities of single neurons .

we showed previously that the gabab agonist baclofen  produced robust presynaptic inhibition, blocking autaptic responses  <cit> . autaptic responses were inhibited by the other monoamines norepinephrine  or serotonin . these modulatory actions were apparently independent of da receptors, as there were instances  where the autaptic response was sensitive to the other transmitters but insensitive to da . so, a single synaptic connection may be subject to modulation via a multiplicity of presynaptic receptors – both autoreceptors and heteroreceptors.

modulation is presynaptic
paired-pulse electrophysiology
to examine the locus of modulation, we did paired-pulse experiments ; an increase in paired pulse ratio  argues for presynaptic action  <cit> . in the dramatic experiment shown , da reduced the size of the ipsc to 17% of control and converted paired-pulse depression to facilitation, producing a  <dig>  fold increase in the ppr. overall, da produced a  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fold increase in the ppr . the magnitude of the increase correlated with the magnitude of da modulation .

fm1- <dig> destaining
to show presynaptic modulation directly, we used the method of fm1- <dig> destaining . fm1- <dig>  was loaded into vesicles by field stimulation , and then free fm1- <dig> was washed away. after initial images were acquired to establish the baseline, vesicles were unloaded with  <dig> hz stimulation, during which drugs were applied by local perfusion. the intensity of staining at several synaptic sites was measured in ccd images acquired every  <dig>  sec . as would be expected from its ability to completely inhibit gabaergic ipscs  <cit> , the gabab agonist baclofen  completely arrested destaining . the d <dig> agonist skf <dig>  or the d <dig> agonist quinpirole  each slowed or arrested destaining at about half of synapses in every experiment. the majority of experiments showed inhibition and in those experiments about half of the varicosities imaged showed inhibition . we never saw an increased rate of destaining with skf <dig>  as might be anticipated from the electrophysiological data. since da agonists produced at most a reduction to 50% inhibition of control gabaergic ipscs , while some varicosities showed arrest of fm1- <dig> destaining , this suggests that a subset of msn varicosities express da receptors that may shut down release. as a control, we examined destaining in ventral tegmental area cultures, which lack d <dig> receptors, and confirmed that skf <dig> was ineffectual . so, both d1- and d2-like receptors appear to be present presynaptically and are thus positioned to modulate msn synapses.

da receptor visualization by immunostaining
we showed previously by fluoroprobe labeling that d <dig> and d <dig> receptors are present on fm1-43-labeled presynaptic varicosities  <cit> . to gain higher resolution images of the distribution of da receptors, we immunostained nacc cultures with either d1-or d2-selective antisera . while the fluoroprobes revealed variations in postsynaptic membrane labeling, immunostaining showed patches of somatodendritic da receptors and what appeared to be presynaptic labeling. contrary to the fluoroprobe data where intravaricose axons were apparently unlabeled, immunostaining revealed not only varicosities but in places wisps of receptor labeling on connecting axonal segments, which by their thin, constant diameter confirmed axonal localization. results shown were obtained with antipeptide antisera to rat d1a receptor  and rat d <dig> receptor . similar results were obtained with antisera to human d <dig> receptor  and the rat d <dig> receptor .

da differentially modulates two-component nacc autaptic connections
in a few experiments , stimulated action currents reliably evoked an initial autaptic response, which we called component <dig> , and after a fixed latency a second, smaller ipsc , riding on top of the initial response ; in one of these experiments, there was another, still further delayed, small ipsc . all the components were gabaa mediated. the fixed delay was most likely due to conduction time in a recurrent axon branch that traveled away from the cell for some distance and then returned to make autaptic contacts. it could be argued that comp <dig> was due to activation of a neighboring cell via depolarizing gaba action  <cit>  or electrical coupling  <cit> ; however, the latency was too short to accommodate an intervening synaptic connection, and did not show the variation that would be introduced by the firing of an intervening cell. moreover, electrical coupling amongst msns tends to be too weak to drive postsynaptic cells to fire  <cit>  under normal conditions  <cit> . another explanation might be multivesicular release  <cit> , but the latency of comp <dig> was too long for this to be the mechanism.

da differentially modulated the different autaptic components . in the majority of the experiments da modulation of comp <dig> was the largest, but in no experiment was the modulation or the multiple components the same. the effects of selective agonists were tested successfully in experiment number  <dig> . exponential extrapolation of the decay of comp <dig> and subtraction to isolate comp <dig>  revealed that da markedly attenuated comp <dig>  with little effect on comp2' . in contrast, the d <dig> agonist skf <dig> facilitated comp <dig> with no effect on comp2' . the d <dig> agonist quinpirole significantly attenuated comp <dig> while modestly facilitating comp2' . since the two components must be regarded as being part of a single synaptic connection – just separated temporally by the conduction time due to an intervening length of axon – da is apparently able to modulate release sites making up a single synaptic connection differentially.

in experiment  <dig>  in which there was the greatest temporal separation of the components, we were able to compare the decay of the control responses and their rise time. as plotted in figure 2b, comp <dig> decayed over about  <dig> min to a relative plateau at about 25% of the initial value, presumably due to washout; in contrast, comp <dig> was stable throughout most of the experiment , presumably because the intervening axonal segment retarded washout. the rise time of comp <dig>   <dig>  msec, was slightly faster than that of comp2',  <dig>  msec. the smaller amplitude and slower rise time of comp <dig> would be expected if it was mediated by synaptic varicosities that impinged on more distal dendrites than those that mediated comp <dig> 

discussion
in postnatal nacc cultures, we examined msn-to-msn synaptic connections and their modulation by da. we focused on autaptic responses because they provided access to single, identified synaptic connections. autaptic responses were subject to presynaptic da modulation, with d2-like receptors predominantly mediating inhibition, and d1-like receptors more often mediating facilitation. the majority of connections showed both d <dig> and d <dig> modulation, consistent with significant receptor co-expression. in some cells, the autaptic responses had two or three components that were differentially modulated by da, consistent with differential trafficking of da receptors to different presynaptic varicosities of the same cell.

medium-spiny neuron connections in vitro
in postnatal culture, most msn neurons show a single autaptic gabaa mediated, ca2+-dependent after-hyperpolarization  <cit> . some connections had a delayed component, with fixed latency, that we would argue was a second autaptic connection made after the msn axon had traveled for some distance, introducing a conduction delay. msn autapses have not been reported in the intact circuitry of the brain, and so they presumably arise in culture because of the artificial conditions, which include the immaturity of the cells, the lack of afferentation, the lack of normal projection targets, and the two-dimensionality of the cultures, any or all of which presumably contribute to the propensity of the cells to form autaptic connections. that being stated, msn autapses do provide a powerful window on the synaptic capabilities of the cells, and serve to frame hypotheses that may be tested in the intact circuitry of the striatal complex, which we have now done  <cit> .

stimulating adjacent msns evoked a synaptic response of larger amplitude and faster rise time that was resistant to washout. synaptic connections might impinge on more proximal somatodendritic membranes, consistent with recent observations suggesting that different populations of gabaergic inputs can be differentially distributed over the dendritic arbor  <cit> . the stability of the synaptic response confirmed that postsynaptic gabaa receptor sensitivity was maintained with the standard intracellular solution we used  <cit> . the single autaptic response, or the first component of the multicomponent autaptic response, showed a progressive decrease in amplitude over the course of about  <dig> min, which would be expected if the release sites mediating the response were close to the recording electrode in the cell soma and so subject to washout. the second component of the multicomponent autaptic response was typically smaller in amplitude and slower in rise time arguing that the recurrent axon made a more distal and thus weaker autaptic connection. consistent with this, the second component was resistant to washout, presumably due to the functional diffusion limitation of the more distal axon. interestingly, while the single autaptic component decreased to a fraction of its initial amplitude, the magnitude of da modulation did not decrease.

the argument could be made that the single autaptic response – or the first component of the multicomponent response – was mediated by an autoreceptor current mechanism, as described by pouzat and marty in cerebellar interneurons  <cit> . indeed, we observed strikingly similar washout kinetics. however, washout of key elements of the presynaptic machinery does not distinguish between an autoreceptor current  and an autaptic  response, but amplitude does. a comparison of the flipped ipsc elicited with similar high chloride-intracellular solutions used revealed that the autaptic responses we recorded were an order of magnitude larger. given the two-dimensional neuropil of the cultures, which should limit the numbers of proximal presynaptic varicosities, we should have obtained the opposite result. a further comparison with their data revealed that second autaptic component they measured, which they deemed to be axodendritic, was in fact larger, rather than smaller, as we observed. the lack of evidence for gabaa receptors at presynaptic sites, either in the intact striatum  <cit>  or in nacc culture  <cit> , argues further against the autoreceptor current mechanism. in our fm1- <dig> experiments, field stimulation that activated most synapses in the culture did not evoke sufficient gaba release to activate presynaptic gabab receptors and arrest destaining. so there would not have been sufficient gaba release to activate presynaptic gabaa receptors, even if they were present, arguing further against the autoreceptor current mechanism. therefore, the autaptic responses reported here, and in our previous study  <cit> , are mediated by bone fide axodendritic autaptic connections.

dopamine modulation
da was the most effective da agonist, producing on average about a 50% inhibition of autaptic responses. in rare experiments, da produced near complete inhibition. however, da was not as robust as the gabab agonist baclofen, which consistently shut down the autapses  <cit> . da and a combination of d <dig> and d <dig> agonists produced a similar incidence of modulation, but equimolar da concentrations produced more robust inhibition . receptor family-selective modulation with da and a single antagonist was also more robust that the corresponding single agonist. this was not due to da acting via other monoaminergic receptors , as there were clear instances where norepinephrine and serotonin modulated msn synaptic connections that showed modest da modulation. moreover, the magnitude of the monoamine inhibition was no greater than the magnitude of da inhibition, so it would be unlikely that da, a poor serotonin or noradrenergic agonist, would have that much effect via the heterologous receptors. more likely, da and the selective agonists activated different da receptor confirmations with differing potencies, as has been described for both d <dig> and d <dig> receptors  <cit> .

most msn connections showed both d <dig> and d <dig> modulation, consistent with near complete overlap in the expression of d1- and d2-like receptors on individual msns. reports of a lesser incidence of colocalization  may be ascribed in part to detection issues with the different methodologies employed. it may be argued that physiological data, reflecting the actual function of the receptors, provide the most sensitive validation  <cit> . the apparent contradictions in the results could also be explained by differential trafficking of da receptors .

presynaptic da modulation
slice studies indicate that most da modulation of msns arises through modulation of synaptic inputs onto the cells with only a minor postsynaptic contribution  <cit> . da depresses gabaa responses via postsynaptic action, but the magnitude was on the order of 20%  <cit> , whereas we observed a modulation on the order of 50%, arguing for an additional presynaptic action. guzman et al.  <cit>  provided the first evidence for presynaptic da modulation in the striatal slice. our paired-pulse experiments provide evidence for presynaptic modulation of msn-to-msn connections in culture. direct imaging of da modulation via inhibition of fm1- <dig> destaining showed that both d <dig> and d <dig> agonists arrested destaining. although we cannot be certain that the varicosities we imaged all belonged to msns, the sheer numbers argue that we were. moreover, msns show presynaptic modulation of their projection synapses  <cit> , so the neurons are clearly capable of mounting presynaptic da receptors.

presynaptic actions of da in the striatal complex have been called into question by the dearth of morphological evidence for presynaptic da receptors  <cit> . however, there is extensive physiological evidence for presynaptic da receptors on three classes of synapses in the striatal complex. presynaptic d <dig> autoreceptors on da neuron terminals inhibit da release  <cit> , d <dig> heteroreceptors on corticostriatal terminals inhibit glutamatergic inputs  <cit> , and presynaptic d <dig> and d <dig> heteroreceptors on msn terminals modulate gabaergic ipscs . da receptors can be visualized using fluoroprobe antagonists on fm1- <dig> labeled presynaptic varicosities of both nacc and striatal msns in postnatal culture  <cit> . when exogenous da receptors tagged with yellow fluorescent protein  are chemically transfected into nacc cultures, they take up presynaptic positions  <cit> . antipeptide antisera directed against d <dig> and d <dig> receptor epitopes mainly visualize receptors on axonal segments and presynaptic varicosities, cell bodies, but not dendrites. possibly, presynaptic receptors are more easily solubilized  with the usual concentrations of detergent used in preparing tissue for immunostaining, and so could account for an artifactual underestimate of the incidence of presynaptic da receptors. indeed, we have found that eliminating detergent from the immunostaining protocol dramatically enhanced presynaptic immnolabeling. in culture, the use of detergent is unnecessary presumably because the fixation process adequately permeabilizes cells. consistent with this supposition, we obtained similar staining patterns using antipeptide antisera directed to extracellular and to intracellular epitopes .

presynaptic modulation is heterogeneous
as suggested by surmeier et al.  <cit> , much of the controversy regarding the distribution of da receptors on msns in the striatal complex would be resolved if msns traffic da receptors to their presynaptic varicosities differentially. otherwise it is difficult to integrate anatomical studies indicating that msns project sequentially rather than in parallel to their major target areas  <cit> , with physiological studies showing d <dig> inhibition of msn projections to pallidal neurons  <cit>  and d <dig> facilitation on projections to the ventral midbrain  <cit> , and data showing extensive co-expression of d <dig> and d2-like receptors in msns  <cit> .

to show differential trafficking directly requires studies at the level of single cells. we have fortuitously found that some msns in postnatal culture show multicomponent autaptic responses. since both responses share the same presynaptic and postsynaptic elements, they should be considered to be components of the same synaptic connection. and, given that they are connections between msns, they then represent the majority of intrinsic synapses in the striatal complex. we cannot rule out the possibility that the autaptic connections arise aberrantly in the absence of their projection targets, given the lack of documented autaptic connections in the intact circuitry. however, this does not detract from the fact that we have access to two separate populations of presynaptic varicosities that together make up a single msn synaptic connection.

given this fortuitous situation, we were able, in the experiments with two-component autaptic responses, to test the differential effect of da agonists. if da receptors were distributed homogeneously on all the presynaptic receptors of a given msn, we would expect that both components of the autaptic response should show the same modulation. if the magnitude of the modulation differed, one could argue that the distribution was relatively homogenous, with variation in the level of expression at different varicosities. however, we found that d <dig> or d <dig> modulation might be lacking on one connection or have opposite effects, consistent with true differential trafficking of the receptors. the discrepancy between our fm1- <dig> experiments, which showed that varicosities were inhibited on an all-or-none basis, and the electrophysiology, which showed about a 50% inhibition, argues that a mix of unaffected and strongly modulated presynaptic varicosities accounts for the modulation we observed electrophysiologically. the immunocytochemical results that showed d <dig> or d <dig> receptors on only a subset of msn varicosities argue against differential coupling to postreceptor mechanisms and for differential trafficking. in recent nacc slice studies, we have shown that da modulates ca2+ influx into the varicosities of single msns heterogeneously, providing further evidence for differential trafficking  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our present culture results, building on several lines of evidence and supported by recent slice studies, make the strong argument that individual msns differentially traffic da receptors to their presynaptic varicosities. definitive support for this argument will require imaging the distribution of da receptors in single msns directly. we cannot exclude the possibility that the presence of aberrant projection synapses in the intrinsic population in our cultures accounts for the differential distribution of da receptors we have observed. gaining insight into the distribution of da receptors on the local synapses of individual msns holds considerable import. da is arguably the major modulator of information processing in the area. if da receptors are differentially trafficked to msn intrinsic synapses, and moreover if trafficking is plastic, then the distribution of presynaptic receptors would play a crucial role in the dynamic regulation of information processing in the striatal complex.
