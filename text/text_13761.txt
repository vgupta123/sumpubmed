BACKGROUND
duchenne muscular dystrophy  is a lethal x-linked genetic disease characterized by progressive skeletal muscle degeneration, occuring in one in  <dig> male live births  <cit> . dmd results from mutation in the dystrophin gene, leading to the absence of a functional dystrophin protein and loss of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex , which together render the sarcolemmal membrane susceptible to mechanical injury  <cit> . these deficiencies in turn lead to chonic muscle fiber necrosis and diffuse wasting, with muscle weakness appearing in childhood, followed by severe parallesis in adolescence, and death in the  <dig> s  <cit> . in spite of the progress made in orthopedic, respiratory, and cardiac management of patients, there remains no effective treatment for this disease.

replacing and/or repairing the mutated dystrophin gene by full-length or truncated versions of dystrophin is an attractive approach that may offer a treatment for dmd. gene transfer of dystrophin into skeletal muscle has been accomplished by intramuscular or intravenous/arterial injection of a therapeutic plasmid  <cit>  or viral vector  <cit> . due to the potential for immune responses, the limited carrying capacity of viral vectors and the difficulty in specifically targeting muscles bodywide, viral vector-mediated dmd gene therapy needs more improvements before demonstrating clinical utility  <cit> . the simplest form of gene therapy is the direct injection plasmid dna into skeletal muscle. direct injection of plasmid dna into mdx mice though intramuscular or intravenous/arterial injection can result in expression of dystrophin in up to 10% of the muscle fibers, leading to a decrease in the percentage of myofibers displaying central nucleation  <cit> . in a phase i clinical trial, nine patients were injected intramuscularly with a plasmid-vector encoding a dystrophin cdna, and dystrophin expression was detected in six patients without any adverse effects  <cit> . these results are encouraging for the further development of this method, however, the poor transfection efficiency for plasmid-mediated gene therapy is still a problem, especially with a systemic muscle disease such as dmd. thus, enhanced expression and increased production and distribution of dystrophin are likely to be important developments for plasmid-mediated gene therapy for dmd.

recently, a class of proteins known as cell-penetrating peptides were reported that had the capacity to deliver their cargo molecules across plasma membrane bilayers and translocate into neighboring cells, thereby increasing intracellular delivery of various cargoes with molecular masses several times greater than their own. these proteins may enhance the low transduction efficiency typically obtained with plasmid-mediated gene therapy, and they include the tat  protein of human immunodeficiency virus  <cit> , the antennapedia homeodomain proteins  of drosophila melanogaster and other species  <cit> , and vp <dig> of herpes simplex virus   <cit> . many experiments have demonstrated that vp <dig> can enhance intercellular trafficking of proteins fused to its n- or c-terminus in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . moreover, vp22-fusion proteins retained both vp22-mediated transport properties and the biophysiological functions of the linked passenger proteins, enhancing the therapeutic effects of transduced genes and proteins. this property has been observed with vp22-linked p <dig>  p <dig>  cd and e <dig> for delivery to tumors  <cit> , vp22-gfp following adenovirus-mediated transgene delivery to cns neurons  <cit> , and vp22-mediated intercellular protein delivery was useful in enhancing the efficacy of myocardial gene therapy  <cit> . vp22-lacz transfection resulted in higher amounts of protein expression compared with lacz transfection. preclinical evaluation using the tk-vp <dig> fusion revealed an enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo using mixed populations of wild-type and expressing cells  <cit> . however, there have been no reports about the application of protein transduction to duchenne muscular dystrophy therapy. here, we studied the translocation properties of the vp <dig> protein fused to a microdystrophin cdna for potential therapy of dmd. we demonstrated that the hsv-1-derived vp <dig> protein enhanced microdystrophin protein accumulation in vitro and in vivo. therefore, vp <dig> may be a potent and versatile tool to enhance the effectiveness of somatic gene therapy for dmd.

RESULTS
vp <dig> mediated intercellular trafficking of microdystrophin fusion proteins in vitro
to determine whether the vp22-microdystrophin fusion proteins were able to spread from a primary expressing cell into neighboring cells, nih 3t <dig> cells were transfected with  <dig>  μg of the expression plasmids pavp <dig>  pamicdys, or pavp22-micdys.  <dig> h post-transfection, indirect immunofluorescen -ce was performed. as shown in fig.  <dig>  in the wells transfected with pamicdys approximately 10% of cells were microdystrophin-positive after  <dig> h transfected; however, 47% of cells transfected with pavp22-micdys were microdystrophin-positive, representing a 370% increase in the number of cells that contained microdystrophin protein. following collection with the media supernatant and transfer onto the c2c <dig> myotubes to analyze whether hsv-vp <dig> is able to carry microdystrophin into c2c <dig> cells, indirect immunofluorescence was performed to detect the expression of microdystrophin after  <dig> min transfection . as shown in fig. 1d, some microdystrophin proteins were detected in c2c <dig> cells transfected by supernatant with pavp22-micdys, the results clearly demonstrated that vp <dig> could transport the vp22-microdystrophin fusions from the primary infected cells  into the c2c <dig> cells.

vp <dig> enhanced microdystrophin gene expression and distribution in ta of mdx mice
to determine whether vp <dig> could enhance microdystrophin protein expression and whether the vp22-microdystrophin fusion proteins were able to spread in muscles of mdx mice, the plasmids pamicdys and pavp22-micdys were injected intramuscularly into the ta muscles, and the expression of microdystrophin were tested by immunocytochemistry  <dig> weeks and  <dig> weeks post-injection and western-blotting  <dig> weeks post-injection. as shown in fig. 2a, microdystrophin-positive fibers per cross-section injected with pavp22-micdys were markedly greater than that injected with pamicdys, moreover, there was no evidence of inflammation in the ta. however, there was a slight decline of microdystrophin-positive fibers in the ta from  <dig> weeks to  <dig> weeks after plasmids injection . western-blotting analysis of microdystrophin gene expression was performed after  <dig> weeks following injection with equal dosage either pamcidys or pavp22-micdys . semiquantitative analysis of band intensity demonstrated that the expression of vp22-linked microdystrophin following pavp22-micdys transfection was  <dig> -fold greater than that of microdystrophin following pamicdys transfection. the number of microdystrophin-positive fibers per cross-section injected with pavp22-micdys were significantly increased when compared to muscle of injected with pamcidys. the average number of microdystrophin-positive fibers in each ta injected with pavp22-micdys was about  <dig> -times higher than that of ta injected with pamcidys after  <dig> weeks . thus, vp <dig> fusion proteins increased the area containing dystrophin-positive muscle fibers to span almost all the left ta muscles and more than tripled the total number of ta myofibers transduced following a single microdystrophin injection.

vp22-mediated microdystrophin gene expression is more efficient in correcting central nucleation in mdx muscle
muscles of mdx mice are characterized by the presence of abundant central nuclei in myofibers, and previous studies have demonstrated that transgenic expression of the microdystrophin in mdx mice remarkably ameliorated mdx mouse skeletal muscle pathology and the percentage of central nucleation was reduced to less than 1% in both limb muscle and the diaphragm, aav-mediated microdystrophin expression also reduced central nucleation from 70% to 14% in 7-week-old mdx mice  <cit> . to further investigate whether fusion with vp <dig> can enhance microdystrophin spread, the degree of central nucleation in myofibers was monitored following injection of plasmid expressing vp22-microdystrophin or vp <dig> alone. he staining evaluated the amelioration of muscle pathology . compared with contralateral muscles of mdx mice treated by pbs, the extent of central nucleation of mdx ta muscles injected with pamicdys was reduced from  <dig> ± 5% to  <dig> ± 3%  and  <dig> ± 4% to  <dig> ± 4% . however, compared with contralateral muscles of mdx mice treated by pbs, the number of centrally-located nuclei in pavp22-micdys transduced ta muscles were significantly reduced from  <dig> ± 5% to  <dig> ± 2%  and  <dig> ± 4% to  <dig> ± 3%  . these results indicated that spread of the microdystrophin fusion protein could retard significantly the degeneration of muscle in young mdx mice. furthermore, vp <dig> enhanced the spread of microdystrophin and was more effective in reducing the number of centrally nucleated myofibers.

vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein improved the distribution in the abdominal cavity and the contractile function of the diaphragm muscle with mdx mouse
it has been reported that the protein transduction domain  of the tat-protein could mediate delivery of the biologically active fusion protein to all tissues in mice following intraperitoneal injection, portal vein injection, tail vein injection and after oral administration  <cit> . to observe whether vp22-mediated microdystrophin fusion protein also could spread in vivo and ameliorate the functional deficiencies of the diaphragm of mdx mice, the plasmids pavp <dig>  pavp22-micdys or pamicdys were injected intraperitoneally in 6– <dig> week old mdx mice. two weeks after injection, the expression of microdystrophin proteins was detected in myocardium, quadriceps and diaphragm muscles by immunohistochemistry. there were almost no microdystrophin-positive fibers in myocardium, quadriceps and diaphragm muscles after injection of pavp <dig> or pamicdys, there were also no microdystrophin-positive fibers in quadriceps after injection of pavp22-micdys. however, some microdystrophin-positive fibers were easily detected in diaphragm muscles  and heart muscles  after injection of pavp22-micdys. to demonstrate if a functional recovery could be measured in the diaphragm muscle, the isometric contractile properties of diaphragm muscles were tested in vitro. compared with muscles that were transfected with pavp <dig>  pamicdys or treated by pbs, vp22-microdystrophin expression led to better protection against eccentric contraction-induced injury .

discussion
presently, gene therapy research for dmd focus mostly on viral or plasmid-mediated gene transfer methods. although viral vectors have a higher transduction efficiency, they display several drawbacks, such as the limited carrying capacity of adeno-associated viral vectors, and the propensity of adenoviral, retroviral and herpes simplex viral vectors to elicit a strong immune response against either vector or transgene encoded proteins. thus, all viral vectors are biological agents that carry at least some risk to patient safety. compared to viral vectors, plasmid-mediated gene transfer has several advantages due to its simplicity, safety and reliability. plasmid-mediated dna transfer has no significant side effects and the highly purified, large-scale plasmid dna can be easily obtained and the quality of plasmid dna can be easily controlled  <cit> . furthermore, dna is much more stable than viral vectors and can be refrigerated for long periods of time. exceptionally, it seems that skeletal muscles internalize plasmid dna much more efficiently than other tissues do  <cit> . therefore, plasmid dna therapy may be more suitable for treatment of muscular dystrophy than viral vector mediated gene therapy. unfortunately, the transfection efficiency of plasmid dna by intramuscular injection is relatively low and transgene expression only occurs within a few centimeters from the injection site.

in this study, the hsv- <dig> vp <dig> protein was capable of mediating intercellular protein transport, significantly enhancing the transduction efficiency of plasmid expressing microdystrophin. to assess the feasiblity of application of vp <dig> in gene therapy of dmd, we first evaluated the vp <dig> shuttle effect in 3t <dig> cells and c2c <dig> cells in vitro. in imunofluorescence study, the vp <dig> fusion increased microdystrophin accumulation in 3t <dig> cells and transported microdystrophin into c2c <dig> cells. following intramuscularly injection of the vp22-microdystrophin plasmid into the ta muscles of mdx mice, the vp <dig> fusion increased both expression and distribution of the vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein. interestingly, microdystrophin mrna was detected in some consecutive muscles adjacent to injected ta such as gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. one explanation is that the vp <dig> ptds may carry the micelles of plasmid pavp22-micdys into neighboring cells. alternatively, ptds may directly carry dna into the neighboring cells. as a result, carried plasmid pavp22-micdys transcript microdystrophin mrna. however, naked plasmid dna renders very low level of gene delivery by direct i.m, electroporation should be applied with i.m to enhance greatly the efficiency of vp22-mediated gene therapy.

due to the absence of dystrophin, dmd patients develop progressive muscle degeneration in the diaphragm, which often leads to respiratory failure and death. therefore, gene transfer into the diaphragm is important for the treatment of dmd patients. microdystrophin has been shown to restore expression of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and improve sarcolemma integrity in the mdx mouse heart  <cit>  and diaphragm  <cit> . however, delivery of the functional microdystrophin gene to diaphragm is a formidable problem. although gene transfer into the diaphragm is readily obtained by either direct injection or pressure-mediated approach in experimental mdx mice  <cit> , it is not feasible to apply those methods to patients. protein transduction domains  can mediate efficient transduction of all tissues in mice, even the brain and skeletal muscle cells when administered by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection  <cit> . for example, intraperitoneal injection of a fusion protein encoding the 116-kda β-galactosidase fused to the tat ptd resulted in delivery of the biologically active fusion protein to all tissues in mice, including the diaphragm and the brain  <cit> . in the present study, expression of microdystrophin, along with a partial functional recovery of the diaphragm contractile properties was observed in diaphragm and heart muscle after intraperitioneal injection of fusion protein plasmid. we found fusion with vp <dig> could expand the distribution of the microdystrophin protein in the abdominal cavity and improved the contractile function with diaphragm. moreover, the vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein could transport into heart muscle through diaphragm. we did not detect fusion protein in the brain or other skeletal muscles, suggesting that vp <dig> has only little capability to cross the barrier of blood vessel. this deficit of vp <dig> may also be improved by using a new type of ptd of vp <dig> with altered amino acid sequence, or by using a different ptd as the carrying vector. alternatively, the purified fusion protein can be injected directly into the body though by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection.

in the present study, microdystrophin gene was used as the functional gene to correct the dystrophic phenotype in muscles of mdx mice caused by the absence of full-length dystrophin. however, the microdystrophin product is less effective functionally at complementing dystrophin deficiency than is the full-length cdna, which is also a shortcoming of aav-vector-mediated gene delivery for dmd. nevertheless, our results suggest that vp <dig> mediated plasmid gene transfer is a feasible gene therapy for dmd. however, careful investigation of vp <dig> transport mechanisms should be conducted before its application with gene therapy since there is little know about the in vivo distribution and transport properties of vp <dig> 

although controversy remains about the trafficking potential of vp <dig>  we demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of vp22-mediated intercellular microdystrophin protein delivery following in vitro and in vivo gene transfection, suggesting that the vp22-mediated protein delivery system can be a useful tool to enhance the efficacy of dmd gene therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results clearly demonstrate that the vp22-microdystrophin fusion protein enhanced the expression of microdystrophin in transfected 3t <dig> cells and transported into myoblast  cells from 3t <dig> cells. moreover, vp <dig> could carry microdystrophin to translocate into neighboring muscle cells in dystrophin-deficient  mice. these results document the efficiency of the vp22-mediated intercellular protein delivery for potential therapy of dmd and suggest that protein transduction may be a potential and versatile tool to enhance the effects of gene delivery for somatic gene therapy of dmd.
