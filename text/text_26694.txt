BACKGROUND
serine peptidase inhibitors represent a constantly expanding group of structurally related proteins. amongst them, the most important family is undoubtedly the serpins, an acronym for serine proteinase inhibitors  <cit>  which describes the functional properties of the superfamily. the name serpin was originally coined in recognition of the fact that most serpins are inhibitors of serine proteinases. however, it is now clearly inappropriate because few members of this superfamily lacked any proteinase inhibitory properties  <cit> . approximately  <dig> serpins have been identified to date and can be found in all superkingdoms including animals, plants, bacteria as well as some viruses  <cit> . both extracellular and intracellular serpins have been identified  <cit> . most of them are glycoproteins  composed of a single polypeptide chain and variable number of oligosaccharide moieties  <cit> . the protein structure of serpins is characterized by  <dig> β-sheets and  <dig> or  <dig> α-helices  <cit> . serpins present a conserved domain, the reactive-centre-loop domain  which connects β-sheets a and c and often acts as "bait" for the target serine protease  <cit> . phylogenetic relationships between orthologous and paralogous serpins have been studied. irving et al.  <cit>  compared several hundred serpin proteins and proposed an arbitrary classification into eight major and eight minor sub-families from a  to p , based on clade recognitions and supports. in vertebrates, serpins are involved in many extracellular processes dependent on serine proteinases such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, cell migration, complement activation and inflammation  <cit> . serpin dysfunction can have pathological consequences and contributes to diseases such as thrombosis, cancer  <cit>  and serpinopathies including cirrhosis and emphysema  <cit> . serpins are subdivided into the nine first groups a to i. the two largest groups so far, in all of the serpins, are the antitrypsin-like and the ovalbumin-like serpins which are designated "serpina" and "serpinb" respectively and composed of  <dig> functional members each. in the "serpina" clade, some of them are involved in a diversity of biological functions. for example, human serpina <dig>  is found and identified as a major component of the fibrillary amyloid plaques of brains from patients with alzheimer's disease, one of the most common forms of dementia  <cit> .

according to the structure of their respective genes , the vertebrate serpin superfamily was subdivided into at least six groups  <cit> . most known serpin genes, including the α1-antichymotrypsin which belongs to group  <dig>  contain a non-coding first exon and a partly non-coding last exon.

clustering of serpin genes occurs in the genome of human and other species. they present similarities in gene structure: the serpina genes characteristically consist of four exons with identical positioning and phasing of the intron-exon boundaries. serpina <dig> , serpina <dig> , serpina <dig> , serpina <dig> , serpina <dig>  as well as serpina <dig> are mapped together in the same cluster on human chromosome 14q <dig>  <cit> . more recently, the gene encoding the serpina <dig>  was also mapped within this cluster. this close proximity in the same cluster suggests that these genes might have arisen by tandem duplications from a common gene ancestor  <cit> . however, in spite of their close physical proximity, the corresponding proteins have disparate functions, raising interesting questions about the evolution of gene function and expression. for example, the serpina <dig> is likely to function in vivo in the germinal centre b-cells  <cit> ; the serpina <dig>  in addition to its activities within the blood clotting and fibrinolytic cascades, seems to participate in several biological processes including reproduction and tumor growth  <cit>  and serpina <dig> produces a rapid inhibition of the coagulation factor xa in the presence of protein z , procoagulant phospholipids and ca2+  <cit> . an approximate protein similarity of 40–45% between the human serpinas  <cit>  could explain these diverse physiological functions.

in mouse, the genomic organization of the serpin family shows significant differences. the cluster of genes corresponding to human chromosome 14q <dig> is mapped on the chromosome 12f <dig>  <cit> . both α1-protease inhibitor and contrapsin genes had undergone considerable expansion in this genome. the mouse α1-protease inhibitor  cluster comprises  <dig> members. the multigenic cluster corresponding to contrapsin  is termed the spi- <dig> locus  <cit>  and, until recently, was thought to encompass  <dig> members  <cit>  with a degree of overall sequence similarity of  <dig> to 80%, despite markedly divergent rcl domains. some of these genes present a significant degree of sequence homology with the single-copy human serpina <dig> gene  <cit> . however, the rcl was substantially different. in mouse genome, these two clusters represent the result of multiple gene duplication events.

in the pig, four serine protease inhibitors were detected at the protein level: pi <dig> , pi <dig> , pi <dig> and pi <dig>   <cit> . pi <dig> and pi <dig> corresponding genes were mapped by radioactive in situ hybridization  to the distal end of chromosome 7q23- <dig>  <cit> . a complete cdna, named serpina3- <dig>  corresponding to pi <dig> and a gene, named serpina3- <dig>  were sequenced  <cit>  and clearly affiliated to the porcine α1-antichymotrypsin  family. porcine pi <dig> and serpina3- <dig> only showed 76% amino acid identity, with the largest difference near the c-terminus containing the deduced reactive site p1-p' <dig> 

the knowledge on bovine serpin genes is much more restricted. hwang et al.  <cit>  identified a serpin, previously named endopin <dig>  at the cdna level, in bovine endocrine chromaffin cells. the same serpin was then purified from bovine skeletal muscle  <cit> . this serpin  was found to be essentially intracellular and widely distributed in bovine tissues suggesting that this protein might have central biological role in a large set of tissues  <cit> . more recently, a second endopin, named mendopin1b, was purified from bovine diaphragm and the genes encoding mendopin1a and mendopin1b were characterized  <cit> .

in order to clarify the complexity surrounding the bovine serpina <dig> genes, we describe here the isolation, the complete sequence and the genomic organization of the bovine α1-antichymotrypsin  multigenic cluster. this cluster was assigned to chromosome  <dig> using a radiation hybrid panel. in addition, we provide preliminary expression data on the bovine serpina <dig> genes. characterization of these new genes and phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding proteins provide new insights on the evolution of serpina <dig> gene cluster. we also propose a nomenclature to designate all the members of this clade.

RESULTS
southern blot analyses of serpina <dig> genes
genomic dna extracted from bovine blood cells was digested to completion with ncii, ncoi and saci endonucleases. after transfer on a hybond-n+ membrane, dna was hybridized with a radiolabelled probe corresponding to a part of exon  <dig> of mendopin 1a gene . after washing under high stringency conditions, several fragments of variable intensity were detected for each endonuclease digest as showed in figure 1a. a minimum of four hybridizing bands was observed for each dna digestion. in particular, five bands with variable intensity were obtained using saci. several fragments were also observed with an additional experiment performed on isolated bac dna  treated in the same conditions . these southern blot patterns are consistent with the existence of more than the two genes mendopin1a and mendopin1b previously described  <cit> . it suggests a complex organization in the bovine genome with more than a round of duplication during evolution from one ancestral serpina <dig> gene.

molecular cloning of bovine serpina <dig> genes
a bovine genomic bac library was screened by pcr with the set of primers described in methods section. four positive bac clones, named bi0123b <dig>  bi0511d <dig>  bi0311e <dig> and bi0382c <dig>  were identified. only bi0123b <dig> and bi0511d <dig> bac dnas were then subjected to long-range pcr with two sets of primers .

after cloning of the pcr products, several positive clones with inserts ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kb were identified with a first set of primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' ends of the mendopin1a cdna sequence. restriction mapping using different endonucleases revealed six different profiles. two of them were first analyzed and assigned to mendopin1a and mendopin1b proteins, which were already found and purified from bovine skeletal muscle  <cit> . in our new proposal of nomenclature, the corresponding genes are named serpina3- <dig>  and serpina3- <dig> , respectively. the four other fragments were also analyzed, sequenced on both strands using several sense and anti-sense primers as previously described  <cit>  and assigned to four new genes: serpina3- <dig> , serpina3- <dig> , serpina3- <dig>  and serpina3- <dig> .

three clones with different restriction profiles were obtained with a second set of primers corresponding to the 5' end of the serpina <dig> est  and the 3' end of the endopin2b cdna sequence  published by hwang and collaborators  <cit> . the clones were sequenced on both strands and assigned to serpina3- <dig> , serpina3- <dig>  and serpina3p . comparison of these genomic dna sequences, using the online software spidey  <cit> , with the serpina3- <dig> cdna allowed us to deduce the gene structures. sizes of exons and introns, as well as exon/intron junctions, were determined. genes are split into five exons  and four introns , as presented in figure 2a. figure 2b shows the sizes of exons and introns for the first eight bovine serpina <dig> genes. these genes have a good conservation of the introns and exons size, except for the intron  <dig> of serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig>  which is due to the insertion of a bov-b line. finally, for all these genes, the translation initiation codon atg is located in exon  <dig>  few base pairs downstream intron 1/exon  <dig> boundary and the stop codon tag is found in exon  <dig>  due to the conserved gene organization of class  <dig> serpins , a potential pseudogene  was also identified. compared to the other serpina <dig> cdnas, serpina3p gene is partially truncated at the end of the exon  <dig> and the beginning of the exon  <dig>  in addition a  <dig> bp deletion in exon  <dig> induces a frame shift which generates a premature stop codon tga at position  <dig> in exon  <dig>  figure 2b indicates also the size of isolated mrnas for serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig>  and of deduced mrnas for serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig> 

localization and genomic organization of bovine serpina <dig> genes
serpina <dig> genes localization within the bovine genome was performed using a radiation hybrid  panel. the roslin 3000-rad rh panel  <cit>  was screened by pcr using primers able to amplify a specific dna fragment of  <dig> bp in exon  <dig>  results revealed a single localization on bovine chromosome  <dig> between ilsts <dig>  and idvga <dig>  markers. the use of a first generation bovine bac-based physical map  <cit>  showed that the four bac clones previously isolated were contained in the single bac contig  <dig>  <cit>  and covered approximately  <dig> kb . using the publicly available 6× bovine genomic sequence assembly   <cit> , we confirmed the rh localization and assigned the bovine serpina <dig> genes to the region 21q <dig>  comparisons of dna sequences allocate some of our sequenced genes to predicted genes in btau_ <dig> , like serpina3- <dig> to serpina <dig>  serpina3- <dig> to loc <dig>  serpina3- <dig> to loc <dig>  serpina3- <dig> to loc <dig>  serpina3- <dig> to loc <dig> and serpina3p to loc <dig>  the genomic organization of the nine bovine serpina <dig> genes was deduced from these results and the bac southern blot analysis . allocated genes are localized on two distinct sequence contigs in bovine build  <dig>  genome  and covered up to  <dig>  mb. the relative positions of serpina3-1/serpina3- <dig> and serpina3-3/serpina3- <dig> were not yet elucidated. moreover, we only succeeded in localizing the serpina <dig> gene upstream serpina3- <dig> in bi0123b <dig> bac clone using the marc_10319- <dig> sts .

analysis of deduced serpina <dig> protein sequences
the deduced amino-acid primary sequences of these eight bovine serpina <dig> genes indicated that protein sizes range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. different numbers of potential n-glycosylation sites  were present . the bovserpins a3-1/a3-2/a3-3/a3- <dig> and a3- <dig> have very similar sequences with 95% of identity and separate from bovserpina3- <dig> and a3- <dig>  only sharing 74% of identity with them. based on protein alignment, a sub-group of bovserpina <dig> could be distinguished. it is composed of bovserpina3- <dig>  bovserpina3- <dig>  bovserpina3- <dig>  bovserpina3- <dig> and bovserpina3- <dig>  the membership of the bovserpina3- <dig> is much more ambiguous. as seen in figure  <dig>  this protein shares more resemblance with that sub-group in its c-terminal part, but its n-terminal part is closer to bovserpina3- <dig> and bovserpina3- <dig> 

preliminary rt-pcr analysis of bovine serpina <dig> genes
rt-pcr was used to determine the presence of serpina <dig> mrnas in bovine skeletal muscles  and also in liver and kidney. because of the high homology between the eight serpina <dig> genes only three primer pairs were used .

rt-pcr, with the primer set serpina3-1/f, serpina3-1/r, amplified  <dig> bp fragments in all tested tissues . two different sequences were obtained. the first sequence is present in all tested tissues and would correspond to serpina3- <dig> and/or serpina3- <dig> transcripts, which could not be discriminated by this portion of sequence. the second sequence is only present in the liver. it would correspond to serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig> and/or serpina3- <dig> transcripts, which could not be discriminated by this portion of sequence.

primers serpina3-6/f, serpina3-6/r and primers serpina3-5/f, serpina3-5/r allowed to amplify a dna fragment only in the liver. surprisingly, with the primer pair serpina3-6/f, serpina3-6/r, after sub-cloning, amplifying and sequencing, a single sequence corresponding to the serpina3- <dig> mrna was obtained. this rt-pcr was supposed to generate a specific amplification of serpina3- <dig> transcript. however, if serpina3- <dig> cdna is one of the minor isoforms of bovine serpina <dig> in liver, it may not be detected by rt-pcr. with the primers serpina3-5/f and serpina3-5/r, several sequences were obtained. they are related to serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig> cdnas but are different from the other cdnas of the serpina <dig> family.

proteomic analysis of muscular bovine serpina3
according to the western blot carried out after 2d-gel electrophoresis of the sephadex g <dig> f <dig> fraction , the antibody revealed series of spots with at least three different molecular weights and ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kda. the calculated relative mass  of the eight deduced proteins is  <dig> kda. the difference of electrophoretic profile could be explained by different levels of glycosylation. each initial spot with different mr spreads out on the ph gradient indicating a large variation in the extent of phosphorylations of different isoforms. their pi values vary from  <dig> to  <dig> . for each mr, the spots probably correspond to a set of bovserpina <dig> isoforms which are not resolved in the present conditions. for information, the position of the two purified isoforms including bovserpina3- <dig>  and bovserpina3- <dig>  are indicated in figure  <dig>  the present results clearly demonstrate that a relatively large set of bovserpina <dig> are expressed in skeletal muscle.

phylogenetic analyses of serpinas
analyses were performed on the deduced amino acid sequences. bovserpina <dig> phylogeny based on maximum likelihood  illustrates a complex situation among this sub-family. three pairs of sequences  are recognized with high bootstrap proportions , ranging from 84% to 100%. they would be the result of very recent gene duplications in the bos taurus genome, which would be supported by their proximity on the chromosome  <dig>  a dichotomy is seen, which separates the endo <dig> group  including bovserpina3- <dig> to a3- <dig>  from the endo <dig> group  including bovserpina3- <dig>  a3- <dig>  endopin2b and 2c. relative orders of emerging within endo <dig> group are not resolved , but bovserpina3- <dig> is very likely to be part of this group even if the n-terminal part of its amino acid sequence showed more similarities with bovserpina3- <dig> and a3- <dig>  finally, the degree of sequence divergence within the endo <dig> group is lower than in the endo <dig> one.

serpina <dig> amino acid sequences were also analysed in the context of a larger phylogeny  including the closest serpina families based on blast  <cit>  similarities and recognized as a part of its sub-group  <dig> by van gent et al.  <cit> . all clades of serpina used in this study are supported by high bootstrap values , except for serpina <dig> clade due to the highly divergent sequence of ornithorhynchus anatinus serpina <dig>  phylogenetic relationships between all clades remain unsolved. however, one exception with serpina <dig>  and serpina <dig>  which are clearly sister-groups with bp of 100%. in addition to serpina <dig>  serpina <dig>  <cit>  and serpina <dig>  <cit>  are found in the bos taurus genome. however, only for serpina <dig> several genes are found especially in mouse.

discussion
two bovine serpins named mendopin1a  and mendopin1b  were recently purified from diaphragma and characterized  <cit> . although the sequence identity between both muscle endopins is close to 93%, the major differences were found within the rcl. these two proteins are homologous to the unique human serpina <dig> and share with it a high identity . the genes encoding these two proteins were shown to be expressed notably in muscle. in this study, we show that bovserpina3- <dig> and bovserpina3- <dig> are members of a family comprising at least six other deduced proteins. the genes encoding these proteins are mapped to the presently named serpina <dig> cluster localized on chromosome 21q <dig>  our results indicate that the locus spans over ~ <dig> kb and contains at least eight serpina <dig> genes with a local order of serpina3-1/serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig>  serpina3-3/serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig>  and the pseudogene serpina3p localized at the 3'end of the cluster. we also mapped another serpina gene, serpina <dig> at the 5' end of serpina3-1/serpina3- <dig>  this mapping is not in agreement with the publicly available btau_ <dig>  genomic sequence assembly. to correlate with our proposed genomic organization based on the physical map  <cit> , it was necessary to invert the relative positions of the two contigs  on chromosome  <dig>  however, all the genes identified in this work had not been listed in btau  <dig>  assembly. to date, the serpina3- <dig>  serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig> genes are not identified in the whole genome shotgun sequence data. this absence is probably caused by the high degree of similarity between bovine serpina <dig> genes. the current btau  <dig>   <cit>  doesn't clarify the situation. indeed, the allocated genes are still the same but are now localized on two contigs distant of  <dig> mb from each other . the new btau  <dig> version, not yet publicly available, might help us to resolve this discrepancy.

all these genes share an exon-intron organization identical to that of class  <dig> serpin genes, as established by ragg and collaborators  <cit>  with four coding exons and one untranslated exon. moreover, they share a high degree of identity both in exonic and intronic sequences. therefore, all these genes established a compact bovine serpina <dig> family with at least eight functional members and one pseudogene. serpina <dig> gene clusters exist in other mammal genomes. mus musculus genome  contains nine expressed serpina <dig> genes and two pseudogenes located on chromosome  <dig>  the deduced proteins display only 55% to 80% of identity. porcine serpina <dig> sequence analysis defined at least three expressed genes   <cit>  with comparable degree of overall identity as observed in mice. on the other hand, primate genomes only possess a single representative serpina <dig> gene, as seen in rhesus macaque, chimpanzee and human, the latter being located on chromosome 14q <dig>  <cit> .

we described, for the first time in mammals, a serpin sub-family of eight genes with one sub-group composed of six very conserved members: serpina3- <dig> serpina3- <dig> serpina3- <dig> serpina3- <dig> serpina3- <dig> and serpina3- <dig>  with high degree of identity over the full sequences . members of the bovine serpina <dig> sub-family arose by recent duplications after divergence from sus scrofa and from an ancestral gene, located on the region 21q <dig>  homologous to the unique primate serpina <dig> gene. they show a considerable gene clustering as the mouse ones, but with notable differences. indeed, rodent serpina <dig> homologues are grouped into  <dig> sub-clades due to three rounds of duplication prior to speciation between mouse and rat. following duplications, mainly in mouse, were then lineage-specific  <cit> . all these serpina <dig> cluster organizations are analogous to the one observed at the family level, that is for serpina. in case of human, where  <dig> members are described, only serpina <dig> and serpina <dig> are located on different chromosomes, xq <dig> and 1q42- <dig> respectively, whereas all others are on chromosome 14q <dig>  they probably also arose by several rounds of duplication within as well as between chromosomes as already demonstrated for human ovalbumine-like serpins   <cit> . the single clade supported by 100% bp on ml tree clustered serpina <dig> and serpina <dig>  although these most related members are on distinct chromosomes and present different activities, non-inhibitory and inhibitory respectively. this suggests that through evolution, the loss of inhibitory function in some serpina occurred several times independently, as seen for serpina <dig> but also for serpina <dig>  finally, in bovine, although the genome is completely sequenced, only four sub-families were identified to date, with serpina <dig>  serpina <dig> and serpina <dig> assigned to chromosome  <dig> and serpina <dig> probably on chromosome x as all other mammal serpina7s.

the potential active domain of serpins, in the c-terminus loop, contains the reactive site p1-p' <dig> responsible for the serpin specificity. in the sub-family of bovserpina <dig> described in this paper, the rcl  has been identified by analogy with other members of the superfamily of serpins. as indicated in this table, boxed residues in bold characters are strongly conserved between these eight putative proteins and are specific of inhibitory serpins  <cit> . moreover, for the sub-family including bovserpina3- <dig> to bovserpina3- <dig>  the full rcl sequence is remarkably conserved with more than 82% of identity. this high degree of conservation was not found in mice and porcine serpina3s. we suggest that these six bovine serpins might have a similar peptidase inhibitory pattern. indeed, we were already able to establish for the two serpins, bovserpina3- <dig> and bovserpina3- <dig>  purified and characterized from bovine diaphragma muscle, a similar peptidase inhibitory pattern against the same proteases, elastase and trypsin  <cit> . these six serpins could represent an original sub-family of the serpina3s in bovine and not found so far in other mammals.

the potential rcl within the c-terminus loop is responsible for the specificity of inhibition. it was identified for the eight putative bovserpina3s by analogy with other serpins. boxed residues in bold characters appeared to be more specific of inhibitory serpins  <cit> . the boxed arginine residue  for bovserpina3- <dig> to bovserpina3- <dig> could be the p <dig> residue for trypsin cleavage  <cit> . the boxed threonine residue  for endopin2b could be the primarily p <dig> residue for elastase cleavage  <cit> . numberings at the two extremities refer to positions in each full sequence. dots indicate identical residues compared to those of bovserpina3- <dig> and dashes show gaps in the alignment.

serpina3- <dig> corresponds to the previously identified endopins 2a/2b  <cit> . however, despite using specific set of primers, we could not amplify the third bovine endopin  <dig>  named 2c  <cit>  on our four different bac dnas.

in mice and porcine, no specific expression analyses have been conducted on proteins encoded by serpina <dig> genes of clusters. however, although bovserpina3s are very close, they share differential expression patterns. for example, serpina3- <dig> is expressed in all tested tissues, whereas serpina3- <dig> is amplified only in liver. moreover, consensus glycosylation sites and the 2d-gel analysis predicted that bovserpina <dig> may be glycoproteins with different degrees of n-glycosylation. in a previous study  <cit> , we have already shown that four potential n-glycosylation sites  are common to bovserpina3- <dig> and bovserpina3- <dig>  however, an additional site  is present in bovserpina3- <dig> and could account for the slightly higher molecular mass  as assessed by sds-page. so, as indicated in the 2d-gel western blot analysis of a partially purified muscle bovserpina <dig> fraction , several bovserpina3s present various states of phophorylation. protein phosphorylation is a very important signalling pathway since this post-translational modification ensured by a large set of specific ser/thr/tyr kinases, might be essential for the biological activity of the protein concerned and/or for a modulation of this activity  <cit> . those observations lead us to propose a differential functionality for these protein isoforms.

CONCLUSIONS
comprehensive analysis of the bovine genome serpina <dig> content combined with phylogenetic clade recognition has allowed us to characterize one original serpina <dig> gene cluster not identified yet in other mammals. some of these eight corresponding proteins were shown to be expressed in various tissues and differently glycosylated and/or phosphorylated. this underlines a complex mechanism of regulation for the biological function of bovine serpina3s.

this coherent sub-family of serpins could constitute a model to study the duplication events and their underlying molecular proceedings at the origin of multigenic families.

actually, it is interesting to notice that the numerous serpina3s of bos taurus contrast with the paucity of other serpina sub-families compared to homo sapiens .
