BACKGROUND
streptococcus suis serotype  <dig> , an important zoonotic pathogen worldwide, has evolved to be a serious problem over the past two decades  <cit> . it was reported that s. suis  <dig> only causes sporadic cases of human infection with a mortality of less than 10%  <cit> . however, it emerged as the leading cause of two large-scale outbreaks of severe epidemics in china in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . the unusual outbreaks affected over  <dig> individuals and killed  <dig> of them  <cit> . besides its large size and the associated high mortality rate, these two outbreaks are unique in that a large proportion of patients were victim to streptococcal toxic shock syndrome   <cit> . before that, stss has been limited to disease caused by the group a streptococcus  <cit> , s. suis  has not previously been linked to stss.

to get insight into the high virulence of the s. suis isolates emerged in china, we previously decoded the whole genomic sequence of two epidemic strains  isolated from the  <dig> and  <dig> chinese outbreaks respectively, and identified a pathogenicity island  designated 89k that is specific for chinese outbreak isolates  <cit> . subsequently, we provided genetic evidence showing that an 89k-borne type iv secretion system  forms an important pathway for horizontal transfer of 89k and secretion of some unknown pathogenic effectors that are responsible for stss caused by the highly virulent s. suis  <dig> strains  <cit> . however, the 89k t4ss assembly process in vivo and in vitro remains largely unknown.

there has long been a general lack of knowledge of t4ss functions and cellular localization in gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . it has been suggested that the assembly processes must be similar to or even simpler than those in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . in the well-characterized model for the agrobacterium tumefaciens virb/d t4ss, the virb <dig> component functions as a lytic transglycosylase that can digest the peptidoglycan layer of cell wall, thus facilitating the assembly of envelope-spanning protein complex of t4ss under temporal and spatial control  <cit> . among the single operon composed of  <dig> genes that encodes the functional t4ss in s. suis 89k pai, only the virb1-89k gene product shows similarity to the agrobacterium virb <dig> component and contains a conserved cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolases/peptidases  domain that may function in peptidoglycan hydrolysis  <cit> . we once proposed that virb1-89k should function to punch holes in the peptidoglycan cell wall to allow the assembly of the t4ss apparatus  <cit> . however, we did not provide direct evidence to support this hypothesis.

in the present study, therefore, we expressed and purified the chap domain of virb1-89k in escherichia coli, and tested its putative peptidoglycan hydrolysis activity in vitro. furthermore, an isogenic knockout mutant of virb1-89k and its complementary strain were used in a mouse infection model to assess the contribution of virb1-89k to the virulence of s. suis outbreak strain. the experimental results indicated that virb1-89k facilitates the assembly of 89k t4ss apparatus by catalyzing the degradation of the peptidoglycan cell wall, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of t4ss in the s. suis.

RESULTS
characterization of the chap domain of virb1-89k
on the negative strand of the 89k pai in the genome of s. suis 05zyh <dig> , peptide encoded by 05ssu <dig> shows 18% similarity to the virb <dig> component of the agrobacterium t4ss and was designated virb1-89k. based on sequence analysis, virb1-89k was predicted to contain a c-terminal chap domain  and an n-terminal transmembrane domain, but lacks a signal sequence. the chap domain is broadly found in proteins from bacteria, phages, archaea, and eukaryotes of the trypanosomidae family  <cit> . it has been proposed that the chap domain may function mainly in peptidoglycan hydrolysis  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of virb1-89k and its homologous proteins showed that virb1-89k and n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase probably originate from the same ancestor .

tertiary structure prediction showed that the chap domain of virb1-89k belongs to the α + β structural class, with the n-terminal half containing  <dig> predicted α-helices and the c-terminal half composed of  <dig> predicted β-strands . protein tertiary structure modeling revealed that this chap domain contains an putative active center composed of a conserved cysteine and a histidine , these two invariant residues form the main part of the active site of chap domain containing proteins  <cit> . these results together with the above phylogeny analysis suggested that virb1-89k may be an n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanine amidase.

expression and purification of the chap domain of virb1-89k
to figure out the function of virb1-89k during the assembly of 89k t4ss apparatus, a 411 bp dna fragment containing the chap domain of virb1-89k was cloned and over-expressed in e. coli as a c-terminally his6-tagged protein. the protein of interest was designated virb1-89kchap. we found virb1-89kchap was efficiently expressed after induction at 16°c . the molecular mass of the expressed recombinant protein agreed well with a predicted size of  <dig>  kda. although a majority of the virb1-89kchap protein was present in the inclusion body fractions of crude cell lysates, sufficient soluble material was produced to recover useful amounts of active protein. highly purified protein  was prepared by ni+ affinity chromatography and gel filtration . n-terminal sequencing results confirmed that the produced protein was indeed the chap domain of virb1-89k.

lytic activity and biochemical characterization of virb1-89kchap
to determine the muramidase activity of the purified virb1-89kchap protein, peptidoglycan hydrolase activity was analyzed by using zymography with s. suis peptidoglycan as substrate. after sds-page, the positive control hen egg white lysozyme, the negative control bsa protein, and the virb1-89kchap protein could be seen after staining with coomassie blue . the gel was then stained with methylene blue to detect peptidoglycan hydrolase activity as a clear zone against a dark blue background. we noticed that virb1-89kchap exhibited apparent enzyme activity as the positive control did, while the negative control bsa did not . these zymography data suggested that the virb1-89kchap protein could solubilize the cell wall of s. suis  <dig> 

in another set of experiments, the bacteriostatic activity of virb1-89kchap was determined with slip diffusion method to confirm its peptidoglycan hydrolase activity. we found that both the virb1-89kchap protein and the hen egg white lysozyme could suppress the growth of s. suis  <dig>  while the bsa control could not .

to reveal the basic biological characteristics of virb1-89kchap, we examined the optimum reaction condition of virb1-89kchap by using micrococcus lysodeikticus cells as substrate. results showed that on increasing the ph, peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of virb1-89kchap increases and reaches maximum at ph  <dig>  . when the ph exceeds  <dig> , the relative activity decreased sharply. virb1-89kchap functions best at an optimal temperature of 40°c. the enzyme activity rapidly declined at temperatures above 50°c and only 25% of the maximal activity was measured at 60°c . from the thermal stability data, the relative activity is higher at 30°c than at 40°c, suggesting that pre-incubation of virb1-89kchap at 30°c causes lower decay in relative activity compared to the enzyme pre-incubated at 40°c . with increasing temperature, pre-incubation of virb1-89kchap caused increasing decay in the relative activity of the enzyme.

role of virb1-89k in bacterial virulence
to assess the role of virb1-89k in bacterial virulence, an isogenic knockout mutant of virb1-89k  constructed in our previous work and its complementary strain cΔvirb1-89k were subjected to experimental infection of mice  <cit> . we found that group of mice infected with the wild-type strain 05zyh <dig> developed obvious clinical signs of s. suis infection, including rough hair coat, weight loss, depression, shivering, and suppuration of the eyes. there were no survivors at 12 hours post-infection . however, mice in the Δvirb1-89k mutant group were all alive at 12 hours post-infection and had a survival rate of 70% at the experimental end point of 7 days. when mice were challenged with the complemented strain, cΔvirb1-89k, data similar to those obtained with the wild-type strain were observed. in the thy control group, all mice survived without any disease symptoms during the entire experiment. these results strongly indicated that virb1-89k is involved in the pathogenesis of chinese epidemic s. suis  <dig> strains.

discussion
t4sss are versatile devices that are found in many bacterial pathogens and secrete a wide variety of substrates, from single protein to protein-protein and protein-dna complexes. they are generally composed of a dozen components that are organized into atp-powered protein complexes spanning the entire cell envelope. in this macromolecular secretion apparatus, the virb <dig> component can lysis cell wall peptidoglycan of the bacteria to facilitate the assembly of t4ss  <cit> . many virb <dig> components in gram-negative bacteria are lytic transglycosylases that can cleave the β- <dig>  glycosidic bond between n-acetylglucosamine  and n-acetylmuramic acid , with the concomitant formation of a β- <dig> -anhydromuramoyl product  <cit> . in some cases, the virb <dig> orthologs can be n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidases that cleave the link between n-acetylmuramoyl residues and l-amino acid residues in certain cell wall glycopeptides  <cit> . in this study, sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that the virb1-89k protein may be an n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase.

to explore the potential role of virb1-89k in s. suis, we engineered the chap domain of virb1-89k for heterologous expression for three reasons: i) the total length of virb1-89k is as long as  <dig> amino acids located within a transmembrane region, suggesting it may be difficult to express and purify the full-length virb1-89k protein; ii) the main function of a certain protein depends on its active domain; iii) recent studies showed that the activity of the functional domain may be higher than the full-length protein  <cit> . by using s. suis peptidoglycan as the substrate for zymogram analysis, we visually detected the muramidase activity of the purified virb1-89kchap protein. in addition, the bacteriostatic activity of virb1-89kchap was also observed with slip diffusion method. these data confirmed the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of virb1-89kchap, indicating the virb1-89k component may play a crucial role in piercing the peptidoglycan layer in the cell wall of s. suis  <dig> during the assembly of the t4ss transenvelope transporter complex.

recently, we reported that the t4ss encoded within the 89k pai not only contributes to the development of stss  <cit> , but also mediates the conjugal transfer of 89k itself  <cit> . the transfer frequency of 89k was reduced approximately 6-fold in a virb1-89k deletion mutant   <cit> . in this study, we found that the virulence of the Δvirb1-89k mutant was reduced to 30% compared to the wild-type level. a similar phenomenon had been reported that the virb <dig> defection in a. tumefaciens can cause a marked reduction of virulence to 1%-10% of the wild-type level  <cit> . these results indicated that the virb <dig> orthologs are important for a functional t4ss, their absence would disturb the proper assembly of the transenvelope apparatus, thus leading to unsuccessful release of the t4ss substrates.

recent studies suggested that cagγ, the helicobacter pylori homologue of virb <dig>  is essential for the caga effector translocation  <cit> . however, little is known about the effectors delivered by the s. suis t4ss that are responsible for stss. work currently underway in our laboratory seeks to determine these pathogenic effectors. furthermore, our future research will focus on the difference in crystal structure between the virb <dig> component in gram-negative a. tumefaciens and its counterpart in gram-positive s. suis, thus facilitating our understanding of the assembly of the t4ss apparatus in gram-positive bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we characterized a functional peptidoglycan hydrolase from t4ss in the 89k pai of chinese epidemic s. suis  <dig>  in the operon coding for the 89k t4ss, the virb1-89k gene product is the only one that shows similarity to the agrobacterium virb <dig> component and contains a conserved chap domain. in this work, the purified chap domain of virb1-89k exhibited evident peptidoglycan-degrading and bacteriostatic activity in vitro. inactivation of virb1-89k reduces significantly the virulence of s. suis in a mouse infection model. the experimental results indicated that virb1-89k facilitates the assembly of 89k t4ss apparatus by breaking apart the peptidoglycan cell wall, thus contributing to the horizontal transfer of 89k and the pathogenesis of t4ss in s. suis infection.
