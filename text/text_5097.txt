BACKGROUND
amplification of genes for the erbb family of receptors is associated with poor outcome in women's cancers, including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer. under non-pathological conditions, epidermal growth factor  receptor  or erbb <dig> is activated by ligand-induced receptor dimerization, resulting in autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of various cellular substrates  <cit> . however, while it is clear that overexpression is a factor leading to ligand-independent signaling via these receptors, the mechanism by which functional dimerization and activation occurs is unknown. since egf binding represents the initial step for activating egfr, considerable work has been devoted to elucidating the mechanisms of ligand binding and dimerization  <cit> . however, molecular details of ligand-induced receptor dimerization are not as well understood.

apart from in vitro biochemical experiments to study mechanisms of egfr activation  <cit> , recent developments in microscopy have made it possible to visualize protein dynamics in living cells  <cit> . the current imaging methods either have a high spatial resolution, such as electron microscopy experiments using immunogold labeling  <cit>  and covalent linking to chemical conjugates like ferritin  <cit> , or high temporal resolution, such as fluorescence confocal microscopy  <cit> , single particle tracking  <cit>  and more recently quantum dots based ligands  <cit> . however, with the currently available imaging technologies, combined high temporal and spatial resolution  has not been achieved.

computational efforts devoted to understanding the extracellular mechanisms leading to egfr activation are mostly equilibrium studies  <cit>  or continuum reaction-diffusion models; see references in  <cit> . continuum partial differential equation based models have also been used to represent signaling processes in the plasma membrane assuming a continuum distribution of receptors  <cit> .

while such studies have provided useful insights, they are not ideally suited for describing cell surface heterogeneities, such as microdomains and anomalous diffusion of surface receptors  <cit> , which are important to capture the spatiotemporal receptor dynamics, and lack spatial correlations, known to arise from bimolecular reaction events  <cit> , such as dimerization. monte carlo  techniques have proven powerful for systems biology modeling  <cit> . in the past, spatial mc approaches have provided mechanistic understanding in other biological systems; see for example  <cit> .

in this study, we have used a spatial mc framework which not only enables a realistic representation of the plasma membrane, but also facilitates integration of different types of biological data produced from biochemical and microscopy studies to gain insight into the mechanistic details of the underlying biological process. we have developed a general kinetic, lattice mc modeling framework to model the ligand  binding and dimerization of the egfr. we compare our simulation results with single particle tracking experiments and analyzed the dominant mechanism of ligand binding and dimerization.

RESULTS
comparison of stochastic and deterministic models
microscopic events modeled in this work are shown in figs.  <dig> and  <dig>  in order to test the mc algorithm and explore possible differences between stochastic and deterministic models, we have performed a number of simulations for various parameters. results from the hybrid null-event mc algorithm were compared with an ordinary differential equations  model with a set of parameters for which the process is reaction limited, i.e., diffusion is fast compared to reaction, in order to test the validity of the mc algorithm. specifically, we simulated a dimerization reaction in the absence of ligand considering a high receptor number density of  <dig>  per μm <dig> and assuming no dimers initially. fig.  <dig> compares the concentration trajectories of dimerized egfr. this comparison confirms that the hybrid null-event mc algorithm captures the time scales of the system resulting in the correct transient concentration profile. additional validation carried out under diffusion control has again demonstrated the accuracy of our mc method .

next in fig.  <dig> we compared the mc and ode concentration profiles of egf bound egfr monomer in the presence of ligand , with a receptor number density of  <dig> receptors per μm <dig> and a low diffusivity of  <dig> × 10- <dig> m2s- <dig>  the low values of receptor density and diffusivity result in a diffusion controlled case. corresponding to these parameters, the receptor dimerization rate in the spatial mc model was slower compared to that of the ode model. the diffusion limited dimerization of egf bound egfr monomer leads to a higher concentration of unbound receptor in the spatial mc model than in the ode model. thus, spatiotemporal mc simulations are required to capture the transient concentration profiles of the signaling species under diffusion limited conditions. overall, low receptor densities and low diffusivities may render the system diffusion limited. under such conditions, well-mixed simulations do not provide accurate dynamics. use of spatial mc bypasses the question whether the system is diffusion or reaction limited. in a forthcoming communication, we will address quantitatively the conditions for which spatial mc simulations are needed.

partial differential equations  have traditionally been used to model diffusion-reaction processes when spatial effects become important. however, accurate representation of receptor-receptor reactions typically requires mc simulation due to the spatial inhomogeneous distribution of receptors stemming from spatial correlations  <cit> . aside from spatial correlations, realistic representation of the plasma membrane microdomains and anomalous diffusion make mc simulation indispensable  <cit> . due to these limitations, pde models have not been employed here.

comparison of hybrid null-event mc simulations with single particle tracking experiments
the dynamics of the ligand binding events were compared with the single particle tracking experiment of sako et al.  <cit>  at an egf concentration of  <dig>  nm in the 0– <dig> sec time interval. to compare simulation results with experimental data, egf was assumed to be associated with cy <dig> dye. a dimerized receptor with two egf molecules was taken to fluoresce twice as intensely as a receptor  bound to one egf molecule. the predicted initial increase of low intensity spots  followed by a slower increase in high intensity spots  is qualitatively consistent with the experimental data ). the initial increase in the low intensity signal was due to the rapid binding of egf on predimerized egfr. furthermore, the increase in the total density of cy3-egf spots , shown in fig.  <dig>  is also consistent with experimental data.

the possible sequences of events leading to the formation of egf bound dimerized egfr at  <dig> sec are shown in fig.  <dig>  sako et al.  <cit>  suggested sequence  <dig> as being dominant. however, the experimental study alone cannot unambiguously determine the sequence due to its limited spatial resolution and the fact that only ligand bound receptors can be tracked. our simulations showed that 95–100% of the receptors follow sequence  <dig>  0– <dig> % sequence  <dig>  and the remaining receptors follow sequence  <dig>  our results are consistent with the hypothesis of sako et al.  <cit> . this comparison serves as a model validation step. small adjustments  in the equilibrium and kinetic parameters tabulated in table  <dig>  which are well within the margins of error, lead to nearly proportional changes in intensity, i.e., no dramatic differences in the simulation profiles are seen .

effect of ligand concentration on signaling reaction mechanism in a- <dig> cells 
single particle tracking experiments  <cit>  are typically limited to low ligand concentrations. high concentration of ligand would lead to fluorescence of a large number of egfrs making it impossible to visualize individual particles. however, simulations can be used to elucidate the influence of extracellular egf concentration on egfr dimerization. our simulations indicated that the relative contributions of sequences 1– <dig> at  <dig> sec change with ligand concentration ). at low ligand concentration, sequence  <dig> dominates, whereas at higher ligand concentration, a significant fraction of dimers form via sequence  <dig>  furthermore, sequence  <dig> also occurs to appreciable extent at high concentration of egf. at low ligand concentration, most of the ligand gets bound to dimerized receptors, which have a higher ligand affinity; however, the extent to which free egfr dimerization can occur is limited. at higher ligand concentration, when a significant fraction of ligand is attached to monomers, the coupling between ligand attached monomer and free or ligand attached monomer gives rise to dimers. the relative contribution of the sequences also changes with time. specifically, initial ligand binding occurs on predimerized receptors, and hence, the relative contribution of sequence  <dig> is higher at short times. at longer times, after binding of ligand on monomers, sequences  <dig> and  <dig> start contributing. with an increase in ligand concentration, the contributions of sequences  <dig> and  <dig> increase at a faster rate. the contribution of sequence  <dig> is higher at longer times after accumulation of ligand bound monomers. as a final note, the time needed to reach equilibrium substantially decreases as the concentration of ligand increases , e.g., to a total of a few sec at  <dig> nm. as a result, high ligand concentrations may challenge single particle tracking experiments also in terms of temporal resolution.

support for the suggested mechanisms also comes from biochemical studies. the experimental study of  <cit>  reported that at low doses of egf, inhibition of high affinity binding by mab <dig> can kill almost 50–100% of egf binding, indicating that most of the early binding takes place by sequence  <dig> at low egf concentration. however, this inhibition is overcome at higher concentration  of egf, which is indicative of substantial formation of egf bound dimerized egfr via sequence  <dig>  consistent with the results of our simulations. a larger scale simulation with variable receptor densities in different regions of the plasma membrane will be developed in the future for quantitative comparison with such biochemical experiments. a recent equilibrium based study  <cit>  has shown that such spatial heterogeneities have strong influence on the amount of egf binding on egfr, motivating a more detailed analysis of egfr on the plasma membrane.

effect of ligand concentration and receptor mobility on signaling reaction mechanism in cells with normal receptor density
two important factors influencing ligand binding and dimerization are the receptor density and receptor mobility. the receptor density can significantly influence the mechanism of egf binding as shown in fig.  <dig>  at lower receptor density  sequence  <dig> occurs to a much lower extent as compared to the a- <dig> cells. for this lower receptor density, at lower egf concentration sequence  <dig> is dominant, whereas at higher egf concentrations, sequence  <dig> is dominant. sequence  <dig> is not important at low receptor density, because of the low amount of egf free dimers .

a tenfold decrease in receptor mobility  leads to a very small increase in the extent of sequence  <dig>  at the expense of sequences  <dig> and  <dig>  and 6). this small increase is observed only at low egf concentration. at higher egf concentration this increase is even smaller. sequence  <dig> occurs to a larger extent at slower diffusion because dimerization is slowing down and so more monomers associate with ligand. at higher egf concentration, this effect is not as prominent because egf binding is faster leading to more egf bound egfrs, thereby increased dimerization occurs among egf bound monomer egfrs even with a higher receptor diffusivity.

several studies have indicated inhomogeneities in the plasma membrane and excellent reviews have been published on this topic including  <cit> . these studies have suggested localization of receptors within small regions, called microdomains, in the plasma membrane. an implication of the containment of receptors in the microdomains is the observation of lower macroscopic diffusivity as has been discussed in  <cit> . as a result, the microscopic diffusivity can potentially be at least 1– <dig> orders of magnitude faster than the diffusivity reported in literature. therefore, we have also studied the effect of a higher diffusivity. in contrast to decreasing diffusivity from  <dig> × 10- <dig> m2/s to  <dig> × 10- <dig> m2/s mentioned above, larger changes are observed at high ligand concentration  and a receptor density of  <dig> receptors per μm <dig> for a change in diffusivity from  <dig> × 10- <dig> m2/s to  <dig> × 10- <dig> m2/s. specifically, the contribution of sequence  <dig> increases from ~15% to ~30% at the expense of sequence  <dig> which decreases from ~85% to ~70%. an increase in receptor diffusivity leads to an increased rate of dimerization between an occupied and a free receptor in comparison to ligand binding on a free receptor. overall, a faster diffusivity can lead to an overall increase in the dimerization rate but this effect is not dramatic under our simulation conditions.

discussion
our simulation results suggest future single particle tracking experiments or related microscopy experiments. it may be difficult to perform the single particle tracking experiments of  <cit>  at higher ligand concentration in a- <dig> cells due to the difficulty in visualization of single egfr and possibly to the short time scales over which transients are over. however, such experiments can potentially be performed in cells with a lower average receptor density. on such cells, the increased contributions of sequences  <dig> and  <dig> should be observed to further validate our model. possible discrepancies between experiments and model could provide new insights to enhance our current understanding of the underlying signaling processes.

the variation in receptor density and receptor mobility can stem from different cell types as well as different spatial features/locations in the plasma membrane . future microscopy experiments should be designed to observe the reaction events and transients of low and high intensity spots, as reported by  <cit> , in different domains of the plasma membrane in the same cell. such data can then be used to estimate the local density of the receptors which in turn can help in understanding the receptor distribution in the plasma membrane.

this work shows the influence of receptor density and receptor mobility as a biophysical control of signaling processes over the inflexible thermodynamic and biochemical properties. a key suggestion from this work is that it is not adequate to treat the receptor-receptor interactions based only on their kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. instead, their spatial properties, such as local receptor densities and local lateral mobility, can play significant roles in determining the intracellular signaling. herein, we have used a simplistic representation of the plasma membrane. this model can be extended to include experimentally reported anomalous hop-like diffusion  <cit>  and other spatial features, such as clathrin coated pits, lipid rafts, caveolae and other microdomains  <cit> . such features not only facilitate an enhanced control at the level of plasma membrane but can also be important for the wide diversity of signaling outcomes from limited varieties of ligands and receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a computational framework for studying cell surface receptor dynamics that can bridge biochemical data on one hand with various microscopy experiments on the other, which currently lack simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution. this work provides an important step forward in the era of in vivo imaging based modeling approaches  <cit> . for example, in this work comparison of mc simulations with single particle tracking experiments reveals how the sequence of receptor-receptor and ligand-receptor reaction events depends on the ligand concentration, receptor density and receptor mobility. our computer simulations reveal the underlying mechanism on the plasma membrane leading to dimerized and ligand  bound receptors.

considering the interest in targeted antibodies for cancer therapeutics  <cit> , a detailed understanding of the biochemical mechanisms involved in signal sensing at the plasma membrane is desired. future advancements in medicine will ultimately also include the mathematical analysis and modeling of erbb receptor diffusion, dimerization and clustering, which will increase our understanding of tumorigenesis and lead to medical advances, such as individualized therapy for heterogeneous cancers.
