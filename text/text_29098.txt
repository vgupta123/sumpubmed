BACKGROUND
microarray experiments can produce expression data of thousands of genes simultaneously. they are useful for disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning as well as the discovery and development of novel pharmaceutical products  <cit> . however, these experiments, which commonly use two colors, are costly and time-consuming, thus there is a need to improve the technology. by adding blue alexa  <dig> as a dye-label, a three-color microarray experiment can be carried out. according to recent experimental and statistical analysis, there is no evidence that the inclusion of alexa <dig> as the third dye-label causes additional noise or unexpected results in the data  <cit> . a three-color microarray experiment requires fewer arrays, saves samples, and simplifies the experimental process, leading to a reduction of costs and time without compromising gene expression data  <cit> .

however, three-color microarrays have not been used widely yet partly because of the lack of data analysis tools. existing data analysis methods are usually borrowed from those for dual-color microarrays and they may not be able to deal with complicated patterns in three-color data. thus, it is important to develop new and more effective tools.

in  <cit> , zhao  et al first proposed the hexamplot to demonstrate the interactions of gene expressions and used the method to assess drug effects based on three-color microarray data. the complicated expression patterns in three dyed samples, as demonstrated in figure  <dig>  can be simplified by the special coordinates of the hexamplot. as summarized in figure  <dig>  the three lines, six regions, and the origin of the hexamplot provide a lot of useful information about the alteration in the gene expression data. a more detailed description of the hexamplot is provided in methods.

although the hexamplot provides a number of useful features, it is not enough to determine drug therapeutic effects with only one plot. in  <cit> , the correlation coefficient  is used to infer the binary hypothesis of drug effects. this approach has several limitations. firstly, statistical testing is largely dependent on the assumption of the gaussian probability distribution, but microarray data does not follow this distribution very well  <cit> . so there is uncertainty in the results of the performance testing  <cit> . secondly, more than two binary hypotheses  should be used in the testing since there should be more than two cases involved in three-color microarray data  <cit> . genes do not function separately but together and drugs also work on different groups of genes in different ways  <cit> . so it is more reasonable to divide drug effects into several levels. finally, the testing ignores the inherent noise and variation in microarray data  <cit> .

in order to ameliorate the previous drawbacks, a novel algorithm, houghfeature, is developed in this paper to assess drug effects based on three-color microarray data. in the proposed algorithm, lines passing through the origin of the hexamplot are used to characterize the drug effects on gene expressions. the direction of a line can be used to determine whether the drug has positive or negative effect on a group of genes and the line slope value can be used to measure the drug effect level. to make these assessments, a key step is to find multiple lines in the hexamplot. the hough transform  is especially useful for this task as it has been used successfully for the detection of lines and even arbitrary curves in noisy images  <cit>  and has recently been applied to microarray data biclustering  <cit> . the houghfeature algorithm can be used to analyze gene expression data from normal-disease-drug samples systematically. naturally, the method can be generalized to deal with more than three colors if additional colors can be used and are beneficial in microarray experiments.

in this paper, we present the methodology and application of three-color microarray data analysis to assess the complex effects of rg <dig>  on hcy -treated huvecs . we classify the susceptible genes in disease and drug-treated cells into different levels according to the slopes of rays detected using our algorithm. we show that the proposed method is effective for the analysis of therapeutic and side effects of drugs on a disease. the matlab programs of our algorithm are included in the attached files.

RESULTS
the houghfeature algorithm
in order to identify significant features in the hexamplot, we propose the houghfeature algorithm to assess drug effects in three-color cdna microarray data. in our algorithm, we firstly identify differentially expressed genes under disease or drug-treated conditions. we apply the ht to the gene expression data, to detect lines passing the origin in the hexamplot. then the drug effects on groups of genes characterized by different lines are quantified according to their slopes. the algorithm consists of the following steps .

input: gene expression matrix enxn; quantization step size in the parameter space δ; minimum number of genes on a line d; and the algorithm that identifies significant genes alg:

houghfeature 

step 1: perform alg to identify the up- and down-regulated significant genes in e, denoted as u and d respectively. ||u||  denotes the number of elements in the set u .

step 2: apply the ht  with quantization step size δ to u  in the hexamplot. corresponding to ||u||  points in the data space, there are ||u||  sinusoidal curves in the polar parameter space. in addition, the origin of the data space is transformed to the line ρ =  <dig> in the parameter space. thus, we can detect lines passing through the origin in the data space by examining the hough accumulator arrays for ρ =  <dig>  we retain a line for further analysis only if it has at least d votes, corresponding to d genes, in its accumulator.

step 3: assuming that the detected lines are li  and their slopes are si , we can then quantify the drug effects as follows:

case 1: si < - <dig>  the drug shows significant therapeutic effect with some positive side effects on the genes on line li ;

case 2: si = - <dig>  the drug shows significant therapeutic effect with no side effect on the genes on line li ;

case 3: - <dig> <si <  <dig>  the drug shows significant therapeutic effect with some negative side effect on the genes on line li as ;

case 4: si >  <dig>  the drug shows significant side effect with little therapeutic effect on the genes on line li .

furthermore, the closer to - <dig> si is, the higher the therapeutic effect with lower side effect the drug has.

step 4: delete the genes on the detected lines from u to update the set and repeat step  <dig> until the value of every remaining accumulator is less than d.

application of the houghfeature algorithm
a three-color cdna microarray experiment was conducted in the biomedical laboratory of hong kong baptist university to study the effect of rg <dig>  on hcy -treated huvecs . the cdna probes of the normal huvecs are labeled with cy <dig> , these of the hcy-related huvecs with cy <dig>  and these of the hcy-related huvecs following treatment with rg <dig> with alex <dig> . thus, there are three groups of comparisons that can be made, including normal vs. hcy-related samples , rg <dig> vs. normal , and hcy vs. rg <dig> group . we can study the three groups in a single three-color microarray experiment, but would need three dual-color cdna microarray experiments for the same task. we can see that three-color microarray experiment is indeed economical, efficient, and has potentials for other applications.

microarray data are always subject to variations from system bias other than the biological difference between samples. so the original microarray data must be normalized to remove the systematic bias. both experimental studies and statistical analyses have been carried out in  <cit>  to verify that standard normalization methods are still applicable to three-color microarray data. in the experiment presented in this paper, we choose the non-linear loess method  <cit>  to normalize the data .

we show a hexamplot of the normalized expression data in figure  <dig>  the data are distributed long along a line that slightly deviates from the slant axis. first, we apply the commonly-used sam algorithm to identify differentially expressed genes  <cit> . in our analysis, we employ the paired data format of sam, considering the expression data measured before and after the drug treatment. in figure  <dig>   <dig> significant genes are selected with fdr =  <dig> , in which  <dig> are up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated. they are marked with red stars in figure  <dig>  most of the significant genes are in the second and fourth quadrants in the hexamplot, supporting the biological view that rg <dig> has been proven to promote the angiogenesis in hcy-related huvecs in many medical experiments.

we analyze the effects of rg <dig> based on the expression data of  <dig> genes and demonstrate the results in table  <dig>  the second column of the table shows the number of genes on each line detected in the hexamplot. in addition to the slope  in the third column, we also show the 95% confidence interval of the slope in the fourth column of table  <dig>  in the fifth column of table  <dig>  we define the neg. t  of drug when the slope value has a negative deviation from the slant axis because the drug-related expression is opposite to the disease-related expression, that is, r is between b and g. the positive deviation can be similarly defined as pos. t  because b is between r and g.

in table  <dig>  the genes are classified into  <dig> lines corresponding to different drug effect levels. we plot the gene expression data in figure  <dig>  where genes on the detected lines are shown in red and those not on the lines in black. in this original data space, it is not easy to observe obvious line clusters because they are embedded in noise or irrelevant data samples. however, in the hough parameter space, each line hidden in the original data is related to a peak point, or the intersection of many sinusoidal curves. in the hough space, we can search for the lines easily by simply filtering out the curves that do not intersect with many other curves at a common point. this is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  where the curve intersections correspond to distinct line clusters. genes on the same line show similar expression patterns and similar drug effects. however, not all  <dig> genes are classified because some genes are located on those lines each of which has less than d genes and are not selected for further consideration. due to noise and outliers, these small groups may not be meaningful statistically. this classification scheme is reasonable because genes do not function separately but together in complex biological systems, as discussed above. in many cases, it is more useful to study groups of genes together that are significantly expressed in a similar way than individual genes separately. this is why a lot of research is being carried out to analyze the functional groups of genes using the microarray technology.

we have also analyzed the biological functions of these resulting groups. currently, the gene ontology  is a well accepted standard for gene function categorization  <cit> . the go project provides a controlled vocabulary for various genomic databases of diverse species in such a way that it can show the essential features shared by all the organisms. in the go function analysis, the hypergeometric distribution is applied to calculate the probability p of the related go 'biological process' terms to assess the significance of our resulting groups  <cit> . the approach is introduced in methods. we list the most significant go function levels of the genes on the lines detected using the houghfeature method in the last column of table  <dig> 

based on the suggestion of some biologists, we set the minimum number of genes in a functional group d =  <dig> to study up-regulated genes. the value of d is about 5% of significantly up-regulated genes. the genes are classified into eight lines, in which the slopes of seven lines are less than  <dig> in the neg. t and pos. t regions and one is larger than  <dig>  to demonstrate some side effects of rg <dig>  based on the go analysis of gene functions, the rg <dig> shows therapeutic effects on the hcy-related genes in regions ii and iii in relation to protein binding , membrane  and calcium ion binding . the side effects of rg <dig> are observed with the function of cytoplasm  in region i. similarly, we select d =  <dig> in the analysis of the down-regulated genes. the genes are identified along seven lines in the neg. t and pos. t region. rg <dig> still shows positive effects on protein binding  as well as protein amino acid phosphorylation , transcription , and signal transduction . the go analysis shows that rg <dig> indeed has therapeutic effects consistently on most of the differentially expressed genes in hcy-related huvecs. the drug is too powerful to make the genes regress to normal perfectly and causes some side effects. in fact, a better pattern of therapy may be obtained by adjusting the drug dosage, which always plays a key role in disease treatment.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that the houghfeature algorithm provides a practical and effective solution to assess drug effects based on the hexamplot for three-color cdna microarray experiments. although a drug has diverse actions on different genes, we can classify the effects into different levels according to the line patterns in the hexamplot.

for multi-factorial human disease involving as many as  <dig> susceptible genes , the hexamplot and houghfeature will be useful for the analysis of gene expressions in disease and drug-treated samples. such a framework may ultimately deliver genomic fingerprint analyses, which are predictive of disease susceptibility and drug effects, thereby permitting the implementation of disease avoidance strategies.

the drug effect assessment scheme based on our method has potential applications to drug discovery and development in both western and chinese medicine. western medicine has a solid theoretical foundation based on biology, biochemistry, physiology and pathology. however, it is ambiguous and difficult to explore specific activities of chinese herbal medicine because of its complexities in components and mechanisms. using microarray analysis as a powerful research tool, there is an opportunity to analyze genetic and biochemical data in a wide range of clinical applications  <cit> . thus, there is a common platform for the research of both western and chinese medicine, including the comparison, evaluation and integration of gene expression data.
