BACKGROUND
salicylic acid  is one of the oldest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  and has been used as an antipyretic agent and in acute rheumatic events in humans for a long time  <cit> . also in veterinary medicine, it has been administered in cases of joint disease in dogs and horses  <cit> . acetylsalicylic acid  was synthesized to have the same effects as sa with an improved gastric and systemic tolerability profile  <cit> . after administration, asa is rapidly converted to sa  <cit> . additionally, asa is sensitive to methanol, heat, change of ph and other factors. so, asa itself cannot be detected with sufficient accuracy, because it is dissociated to sa and acetylic acid, even during sample storage and lc-ms analysis. even though asa is not frequently used as a therapeutic agent in horses, its metabolite sa is of special interest in equestrianism since it is a natural component of many plants used as horse feed, e.g. alfalfa hay or willow bark. therefore, sa concentrations can be found in blood and urine samples of horses after consumption of any of these plants  <cit> . this led to the establishment of thresholds by horse sport organizations for sa in urine and plasma to avoid positive doping cases due to accidental feed intake, resulting in false positive. the international equestrian federation  and most of the horseracing authorities  have set sa thresholds at 750 μg/ml in urine and  <dig>  μg/ml in plasma  <cit> . these threshold levels were based on several studies  <cit> , in which the average urine concentration of sa was dependent on the horse’s diet and country of origin. however, the thresholds were established on a arbitrary statistical basis and not extrapolated from any irrelevant plasma or urine concentration as proposed by toutain and lassourd  <cit> .

the study presented aimed to investigate average time intervals elapsed until plasma and urine concentrations fall below the threshold after oral administration of different dosages of asa. recommended asa dosages for horses in literature vary between  <dig> and 100 mg/kg and from twice daily to every other day  <cit> . main indications are inflammatory processes, pain and fever. in this cross-over designed study, eight horses received  <dig>  mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg asa orally once daily. blood and urine samples were analyzed via hplc-ms/ms. furthermore, to assess the efficacy of salicylates on cox- <dig> and cox- <dig> inhibition in horses, the ic <dig>  i.e. the drug concentration required to inhibit 50% of cox activity in vitro, was determined for asa and sa in a whole blood assay.

methods
pharmacokinetic study
animals
the animal study protocol was approved by the regional administration of the governmental body . eight standardbred horses  were used in this study. horses were housed in stables of serumwerk memsen, wdt, germany  with straw bedding and daily turnout. they were fed a diet free from detectable sa contamination consisting of hay, grass, beets and water ad libitum. all horses were healthy on the basis of a clinical examination prior to the study.

animal study
three dosages of asa were chosen:  <dig>  mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg bodyweight once daily. horses received single oral doses of the asa powder  mixed with syrup in 100 ml syringes. the study was conducted in a 4-way, 3-treatment cross-over design with a washout period of at least 2 weeks. blood samples were drawn in lithium heparin tubes at the following timepoints: − <dig>  − <dig>  − <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 168 h after treatment. plasma was separated after centrifugation  immediately after withdrawal. three blank urine samples  were taken from each horse between  <dig> and 18 h before treatment. urine samples were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 192 h after treatment for each dosage tested; for 50 mg/kg asa, an additional sample was taken after 216 h. both, urine and plasma samples were stored at −20 °c until analysis .

quantification of sa in urine and plasma
initially, it had been planned to measure asa and sa in urine and plasma samples. however, this this was not feasible as asa turned out to be sensitive to methanol, heat, change of ph and was continuously dissociated to sa, even during lc-ms analysis. asa could therefore not be detected with sufficient accuracy so that it was decided to convert all asa to sa and to measure total salicylates in plasma and urine by increasing the ph to 13– <dig>  since sa is the main metabolite of asa, no other metabolites such as gentisic or salicyluric acid were quantified. quantification of sa was partially based on methods described previously  <cit>  and accomplished by an internal standard calibration. sa concentrations were determined using chromatographic peak area/concentration ratios and linear regression analysis to is area ratios.

materials and chemicals
ammonium acetate, glacial acetic acid, potassium hydroxide, sodium dihydrogen phosphate-monohydrate, di-sodium hydrogen phosphate and methanol  were obtained from merck ; acetonitrile  was purchased from vwr . oasis ® hlb spe cartridges  were purchased from roche . deionised water was of milliq grade. sa and the internal standard d4-sa were obtained from sigma-aldrich  and toronto research chemicals , respectively. for standard curves, pooled urine of horses with known sa concentrations as well as commercially available equine donor plasma  were used.

plasma sample preparation
for plasma samples, a direct injection method published by thomas et al.  <cit>  was modified. to 500 μl milli-q-water and 1 μg of the internal standard d4-sa 500 μl plasma were added. samples taken up to 6 h  and up to 8 h after asa administration were diluted 1: <dig> in milli-q-water before sample preparation. for protein precipitation,  <dig>  ml acetonitrile were added and gently mixed. after centrifugation , 20 μl of koh  were added to the supernatant to alkalinize the sample to ph 13– <dig> for 20 min in order to hydrolyze all asa to sa. to make the ph compatible with the hplc column, the sample was adjusted to ph 1– <dig> by adding 20 μl hcl  and centrifuged again . 200 μl aliquots were used for hplc-ms/ms analysis.

urine sample preparation
the sample preparation for the quantitative analysis of sa was performed following the method described by schenk et al.  <cit>  and included a solid phase extraction. briefly, 2 μg of the internal standard d4-sa were added to 100 μl of urine and 900 μl of milli-q-water. samples taken during the first 24 h after treatment were diluted 1: <dig> in milli-q-water , whereas samples of the 50 mg/kg group were diluted 1: <dig>  to enforce hydrolysis of any remaining asa to sa, the ph was adjusted to 13– <dig> by addition of 40 μl koh . after 20 min an adjustment to ph  <dig> was achieved by addition of  <dig>  ml phosphate buffer . after centrifugation , solid phase extraction was performed with conditioned oasis® hlb 3 cc  extraction cartridges . samples were then evaporated to dryness in a rotary evaporator and dried residues dissolved in 200 μl ammonium acetate/acetonitrile  for hplc-ms/ms injection.

instrumentation-liquid chromatography
the liquid chromatography system comprised an agilent series  <dig> lc . analyte separation  was achieved with a nucleodur pyramid column  from macherey-nagel . for plasma samples, a gemini c <dig> phenyl  guard column was added . the mobile phase comprised ammonium acetate buffer  and acetonitrile . the following programmed mobile phase gradient was used for analyte separation: gradient b 0–100% in 7 min, held for 1 min at 100% b, reequilibration time at 0% b for 3 min, run time 11 min. the mobile phase flow rate was 800 μl/min. the retention time was  <dig>  min.

instrumentation-mass spectrometry
mass analysis was performed on an api  <dig> triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer , equipped with an electrospray ionisation  interface. samples were measured in the negative operation mode at an interface temperature 450 °c with an ion spray voltage of −4500 v. collision-induced dissociation with nitrogen was performed at a collision gas pressure of  <dig>  × 10− <dig> pa. diagnostic ions were detected in the multiple reaction monitoring mode . the transition ions monitored for sa were m/z 137 → −93; m/z 137 → −65; m/z 137 → −41; m/z 137 → −75; those for d4-sa were m/z 141 → −97; and m/z 141 → − <dig>  the quantifying ion for urine samples were m/z 137 → − <dig>  and m/z 137 →  <dig>  for plasma, respectively. data acquisition and analysis were accomplished with analyst® software .

method validation
the method was validated according to the guidelines of the european horseracing scientific liaison committee  <cit> . validation parameters were selectivity, recovery, linearity, limit of quantification, limit of detection, analyte stability, precision, and accuracy. the calibration range was  <dig> to 250 μg/ml  and  <dig>  to 20 μg/ml .

recovery was only calculated for urine, as plasma concentrations were determined by direct injection. to prove stability, quality control samples were stored under the same conditions as post administration samples for a minimum of 4 weeks.

pharmacokinetic analysis
pharmacokinetic parameters of sa in plasma were calculated with winnonlin®  <dig>  , using a non-compartmental analysis. because the sa concentration in plasma samples of untreated horses was below of the lloq , the absolute values were used for the pk calculation. the following information was obtained: cmax, tmax, clearance , mrt, elimination rate constant, half-life λz and auclast.

pharmacodynamic study, cox- <dig> assay, cox- <dig> assay
materials and chemicals
compounds used for the pharmacodynamic study were asa and sa . substances were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide  in concentrations from  <dig>  to 1000 mmol/l. lps  used for cox- <dig> assays was obtained from sigma aldrich, munich, germany. samples were analyzed for thromboxane b <dig> and prostaglandin e <dig> concentrations using enzyme immunoassays .

animals and study design
according to brideau et al.  <cit>  and mccann et al.  <cit> , the cox- <dig> inhibition was quantified by each substance’s ability to inhibit the formation of clot-induced thromboxane b <dig>  using blood from six clinically healthy warmblood horses . to assess cox- <dig> inhibition, lps-induced prostaglandin e <dig>  production was measured.

in vitro assay
for the cox- <dig> assay, blood was drawn by jugular venipuncture into vacuum tubes containing no anticoagulant . immediately afterwards, blood aliquots  were transferred into polypropylene tubes prepared with 5 μl of vehicle , asa or sa at final concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 1000 μmol/l. after mixing, tubes were incubated for 1 h at 37 °c to allow the blood to clot. samples were then centrifuged at 4 °c and  <dig> × g for 10 min. supernatants were stored at −80 °c until analysis.

for the cox- <dig> assay, plasma was drawn in lithium heparin tubes . aliquots of 500 μl were transferred into polypropylene tubes and preincubated with 10 μl lps dissolved in phosphate buffered saline . after 5 min of incubation at 37 °c, asa or sa were added. a further incubation period of 24 h at 37 °c followed. one aliquot of blood was not incubated with lps and used as control. samples were centrifuged as described above and supernatants stored at −80 °c. a pre-incubation with a cox- <dig> inhibitor was not included in the performed cox- <dig> assay. after thawing, samples were diluted in eia buffer  and used directly for the immunoassays without a preliminary extraction. the immunoassays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

statistical analysis
data were analyzed with a commercially available software program  by use of a one-way-repeated measures analysis of variance followed by the bonferroni post hoc test. values of p <  <dig>  were considered statistically significant. the concentration leading to a 50% inhibition of cox activity  was calculated with winnonlin® professional edition, version  <dig> , inhibitory effect sigmoid imax model .). the vehicle control was used as baseline .

RESULTS
validation of the analytical method
identification of sa was ensured by its specific retention time and four characteristic ion transitions. as no sa free horse urine and plasma was available, traces of sa could be detected in each sample. nevertheless, the sa concentrations were mostly below the lloq and could easily be discriminated from the spiked samples. plasma and urine samples spiked with sa that had been stored under the same conditions as the post administration samples, storage at −20 °c for four weeks did not show any significant difference in analyte degeneration . recovery was calculated to be 51% in urine.

calibration curves were found linear in plasma and urine relating to the specified concentration ranges. the llod was estimated at 1 μg/ml for urine and  <dig>  μg/ml for plasma. the lloq was determined at 5 μg/ml for urine and  <dig>  μg/ml for plasma. summary results for precision and accuracy are listed in table  <dig> table  <dig> precision and accuracy of the analytical method, summary results for plasma and urine

discussion
a method for the quantitative analysis of sa in horse urine and plasma has been developed and validated. because of the distinctive instability of asa during the whole process of sample storage, preparation and analysis, it was decided to convert asa completely to sa. thus the origin of analysed sa values may be caused by a medication with sa or asa which is metabolized to sa as well as by sa as a feeding component of plant origin . with a llod  of  <dig>  μg/ml  plasma the method is sensitive enough to detect an asa administration, because mean population values of sa were reported to be about  <dig>  μg/ml. the llod  for urine was determined to be  <dig>  μg/ml which is adequate considering the high mean population value of  <dig>  μg/ml  <cit> . the sa concentration in plasma and urine samples  of the horses used in the described study was less than  <dig>  μg/ml plasma and between < <dig> and 51 μg/ml urine.

according to our data, asa inhibits cox- <dig> more potently than cox- <dig>  with ic <dig> values of  <dig>  μmol/l and  <dig>  μmol/l, respectively. this finding is supported by the fact that asa is known to only inhibit cox- <dig> irreversibly  <cit> . the ic <dig> values calculated for asa confirm results from other non-equine where asa ic <dig> values from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μmol/l for cox- <dig> and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μmol/l for cox- <dig> were described . on the contrary, vane and botting  <cit>  calculated an asa ic <dig> of 278 μmol/l for cox- <dig>  sa did not inhibit either cox effectively enough to calculate an ic <dig> value for the concentrations used in this study . similar findings have been reported in other studies  <cit> . however, since sa does have a clinically proven effect  <cit>  there has to be another mode of action. an action trough nf-κb or gentisic acid is just mentioned, but no specific role of these factors has been proposed to explain the anti-inflammatory activity of sa  <cit> .

in doping control the international threshold for sa in plasma is  <dig>  μg/ml. this means that a sa confirmation may only be reported as “positive” if the detected concentration is above this limit. a sa concentration above this threshold can not be explained by sa as a feeding component. measuring sa concentrations below the threshold level, it remains unclear if the measured sa concentration is caused by an asa or sa medication or by sa as a feeding component  <cit> . the presented excretion study should give evidence in how far this threshold is exceeded after a therapeutic medication of asa.

the threshold was exceeded by 30 min and eight 8 h following oral administration of  <dig> and 50 mg/kg asa, respectively. twenty-four hours after administration of 25 mg/kg and thirty-six hours after administration of 50 mg/kg plasma concentrations of all horses were below the threshold again. the lower dosage of  <dig>  mg/kg which may be used because of the antithrombotic effects of asa, led to “positive” concentrations for 12 h after administration. thus the detection period of an asa administration in a blood sample is rather short.

the detection of an asa medication is even more difficult in urine samples when applying the urine threshold of 750 μg/ml. concentrations higher than this level were only detected for 24 h after the 50 mg/kg and for 12 h after administration of the  <dig> or  <dig>  mg/kg dose. after administration of  <dig>  mg/kg one horse did not exceed the threshold at all.

as the detection period of an asa medication  is less than one day in almost all horses of our study, it has to be discussed whether its therapeutic effect can be controlled adequately with the existing rules.

broome et al.  <cit>  described a rapid decline of the asa concentration after intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg asa to horses. the asa concentration was below  <dig>  μg/ml after four hours  <cit> . comparing the asa concentrations measured by broome et al.  with the ic <dig> values calculated in the described study, it can be concluded that a cox- <dig> inhibitory effect may be reached for a period of about  <dig> to 4 h. a cox- <dig> inhibition should be expected for only  <dig>  h. there are hints that salicylates accumulate in synovial fluid after systemic administration, as demonstrated in vitro by friebe et al.  <cit>  who simulated a systemic asa treatment with 20 mg/kg i.v. in the isolated perfused equine distal limb. extrapolated from synovial fluid concentrations measured in vitro, a cox- <dig> inhibitory effect can be expected in the joint for about  <dig> to 8 h  and 2 h . the results of the in vitro and in vivo studies  <cit>  indicate that even if sa values in plasma and urine fall below the thresholds, one cannot exclude any therapeutic effect, especially since nsaids are generally known to accumulate in inflammatory exudate  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the established sa thresholds of 750 μg//ml urine and  <dig>  μg/ml plasma appear too generous and are leaving space for misuse of the anti-inflammatory and analgetic compound asa especially for countries where horse feed is not naturally rich in salicylates.
