BACKGROUND
dna double strand breaks  can be caused by ionizing radiation, reactive oxygen species and other endogenous and exogenous events. if these breaks are not repaired they ultimately result in cell death. inaccurate repair of these breaks can generate chromosomal translocations, deletions and mutations which can lead to genetic instability and contribute to the development and progression of cancer. there are two main pathways to repair dsbs, homologous recombination  and non-homologous end joining  <cit> . hr occurs with minimal loss of genetic material increasing its accuracy and only occurs when a homologous chromosome is present providing extensive regions of sequence homology. nhej is error-prone, however it does not require a homologous chromosome or significant regions of homology and is the predominant pathway to repair ir-induced dna dsbs. nhej is initiated upon ku binding to the dna termini generated from the dsb. subsequent binding of the dna dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit  forms the activated dna-pk holoenzyme <cit> . active dna-pk then catalyzes autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of other downstream nhej proteins such as artemis <cit> , mre11/rad50/nbs <dig>  <cit> , and dna ligase iv/xrcc <dig>  <cit> .

ku plays a key role in the nhej pathway by binding dna ends and recruiting other downstream proteins. the crystal structure of ku revealed a bridge and pillar region comprised of both ku <dig> and ku <dig> subunits that forms a ring around dna  <cit> . these studies revealed the ring shape in the presence and absence of dna as well as a great deal of structure homology between the two subunits, despite the fact that they share minimal sequence homology <cit> . the 3-dimensionial structure of ku enables the protein to slide or translocate along the length of a dna molecule <cit> . however, it is unclear how ku dissociates from the dna upon completion of the nhej pathway when the termini are eventually ligated. additional studies have demonstrated that upon dna-pkcs binding, ku translocates inward along the dna in an atp independent manner  <cit>  consistent with the sliding model. studies have shown that ku binds dna in a sequence independent fashion by way of several hydrophobic residues that make contact with the major groove of dna and several basic residues that interact with the phosphate back bone <cit> . studies have shown that the ku <dig> subunit is proximal to the dsb and ku <dig> is distal to the dsb <cit> .

while much is known about the biochemical activities of ku, its physiological regulation is less well understood. it has been determined that oxidative stress has a significant effect on the nhej pathway. previous studies have shown that under oxidative conditions there is a marked decrease in dna-pk activity <cit> . more specifically, oxidative stress has been shown to impair ku's ability to bind dna <cit> . research has indicated a conformational change in ku under oxidized conditions that leads to a significantly higher koff rate  <cit> . the affect oxidative stress has on ku is a curious issue when thinking in terms of the crystal structure of ku. the crystal structure does not reveal any disulfide bonds, however it is lacking several amino acids, particularly a cysteine in the c-terminal region of ku <dig> 

to further understand how redox conditions influence ku structure and activity we constructed, purified and characterized several mutants of ku. these mutations were introduced in key positions of the ku <dig> subunit that have been implicated in redox regulation. the results are discussed with respect to the effect of redox on ku structure and activity.

RESULTS
identification and mutation of potential redox regulated sites in ku
our previous analyses indicated that specific regions or domains of ku may be involved in redox regulation of ku dna binding activity. we have reported alterations in ku structure as a function of redox conditions and identified c <dig> of ku <dig> as an accessible cysteine position in a region where a modification of cysteine chemistry could potentially influence dna binding. chemical reactivity probes also identified the c-terminal domain of ku which contains c <dig> as an area of interest that has the potential to influence the dna binding activity of ku  <cit> . therefore we prepared two mutants of c <dig> replacing this amino acid with an alanine or a serine. the serine substitution retains the potential to serve as a hydrogen bond donor, while the alanine does not. both alanine and serine are not sensitive to redox conditions and thus provide an assessment of the role of c <dig>  if any, in ku redox regulation. to assess the role of the c-terminus of ku <dig> and c <dig>  we prepared a truncation mutant of ku <dig> via pcr primers designed to introduce a stop codon after amino acid  <dig>  each construct was used to generate a recombinant baculovirus and co-expressed with wild type his -tagged ku <dig>  the recombinant proteins were purified via ni-agarose column chromatography followed by fractionation on a macro-prep q anion exchange matrix. sds-page analysis of the purified proteins is presented in figure  <dig>  the results demonstrate a 1: <dig> stoichiometry for each preparation which was confirmed by western blot analysis. this was especially important for the ku70/80Δc construct where the truncated ku <dig> migrates very closely to the 6-tagged ku <dig> as judged on a coomassie blue stained gel. the reactivity of this protein with an antibody to the ku <dig> n-terminus confirmed co-expression and 1: <dig> stoichiometry . analysis of the c <dig> mutants also demonstrated 1: <dig> stoichiometry and no alterations in protein expression or degradation as a result of this change .

dna binding of ku is independent of the ku  <dig> ctd and c493
dna binding of the purified ku variants was assessed in ems as using a 30-bp duplex dna under reduced conditions, which we have shown allow for maximal dna binding activity of ku  <cit> . analysis of the c493a variant  demonstrates near wild type binding to duplex dna, indicating that the mutation to an alanine does not influence the interaction with dna under reduced conditions. similar results were observed with the c493s mutant with binding being similar to wild type . the results presented in figure 2b demonstrate that the ku70/80Δc variant lacking the c-terminal domain is capable of binding dna with only as light reduction in binding affinity compared to wild type ku . quantification of the data is presented in figure 2c. while this c-terminal domain has been demonstrated to be involved in activation of dna-pkcs <cit> , these results demonstrate that dna binding is only moderately affected by removal of this domain, a result consistent with the crystal structure of the ku heterodimer bound to dna  <cit> . these data support the contention that no dramatic alteration in dna binding activity is manifested by the introduced changes in the protein's primary structure.

redox effects on dna binding
to assess the effect of redox on ku binding we used the cysteine specific oxidant, diamide, to oxidize ku and then assessed binding in are action performed in the absence of added dtt. previously we have shown that under these conditions ku exhibits a reversible oxidation event that impairs dna binding  <cit> . the results presented in figure  <dig> demonstrate that wild type ku displays a decrease in dna binding activity as a function of diamide concentration, consistent with our previous results <cit> .

interestingly, the c493a mutant also exhibited a decrease in binding as a function of redox conditions . these results suggest that the redox-dependent inhibition of ku dna binding activity is independent of c <dig>  a similar line of experimentation was performed with the truncation mutant  and again ku binding was reduced in both protein preparations as a function of diamide. we also reversed the conditions to re-reduce the protein by incubation with additional dtt. the result of this treatment was the restoration of dna binding activity for the wild type protein and ku 70/80Δc truncation variant. interestingly, full dna binding activity was not observed for either protein preparation, thus the potential for a persistent redox-dependent structural change exists in ku . to determine if in fact a persistent structural alteration in ku exists following diamide oxidation and re-reduction, we performed a limited tryptic digest of the ku that was treated with dtt before diamide addition at a ratio that does not result in ku oxidization  and ku that was first treated with diamide to oxidize the proteins was then re-reduced with dtt. the final concentration of all components was identical prior to the tryptic cleavage reactions. the results presented in figure  <dig> demonstrate that there is somewhat more tryptic cleavage under the control conditions compared to the re-reduced ku and this is apparent in both the wild-type and ku70/80Δc mutant. this is also apparent in the prominence of the lower molecular mass peptides  under control conditions and the prominence of the full length proteins in the re-reduced conditions. this is somewhat surprising in that the better dna binding conditions  result in greater tryptic susceptibility. quantification of the data, which is presented in figure  <dig>  bears out the interpretation that re-reduced ku is slightly less susceptible to tryptic cleavage. a difference in peptide product distribution was observed between the wild type and ku70/80Δc under both conditions that could not be attributed to the truncation. this suggests that the folding or conformation of the ku70/80Δc protein differs from that of wild type ku. interestingly this minor difference may account for the difference in dna binding affinity observed in the emsa dna binding analysis of the ku70/80Δc.

while the ability of diamide to reversibly oxidize the ku variants suggests that c <dig> and c <dig> are not involved in redox regulation, we have previously demonstrated that solution based true equilibrium binding assays can often allow differences in activity to be determined that are not observed in ems as. therefore we assessed binding of wild type and ku variants to a duplex dna substrate using a fluorescence polarization assay. a 30-bp duplex with a single fluoroscein label on one 5' terminus was used and ku protein preparations were titrated into the binding reactions. wild type and ku mutants under reduced conditions displayed identical binding and, upon oxidation with diamide, minimal dna binding was detected . the oxidized ku proteins where then re-reduced by the addition of excess dtt and titrated into binding reactions. in this analysis, wild type ku regained complete dna binding activity while the ku70/80Δc again regained significant dna binding activity, though not complete. this data is consistent with the alteration in trypsin sensitivity observed following re-reduction after oxidation such that after re-reduction both wild type and ku70/80Δc were less sensitive to trypsin digestion and suggest an alteration in structure that impacts dna binding activity. overall, these analyses provide insight into how ku structural features impact redox regulation. amore complete understanding of this complex interplay is likely to require additional genetic and structural analyses as well as an investigation of cellular redox regulators that may perform this function in vivo.

discussion
it has been previously shown that the ku-dna interaction is favored under reduced conditions <cit> . physiologically, ku, dna-pk and nhej have all been demonstrated to be influenced by cellular redox conditions <cit> . typically, redox dependent alterations in enzymatic or binding activity can be attributed to the formation and breaking of disulfide bonds. interestingly, x-ray structural analysis of ku does not reveal the presence of any disulfide bonds  <cit> . therefore, the oxidation effects observed in vitro are likely to be a result of the formation of cysteine sulfenic acids. this reversible modification is consistent with the near complete rescuing of dna binding activity upon re-reduction . cellular modifications as a function of redox however, may be manifested by different modifications and interactions.

specifically, glutathionine conjugations to ku could be responsible for the decreased binding activity observed in cells exposed to ros via treatment with glucose and glucose oxidase <cit> . also, protein-protein disulfide bonds between exposed cysteine residues could account for the reduction in binding. this, however, is unlikely to account for all the reduction as the ku protein level was reduced and not observed as highly cross linked  <cit> . preliminary data demonstrate that at least  <dig> cysteine residues are readily accessible, one being located in the c-terminal domain, and thus glutathionine conjugates or modification to sulfenic acid could account for the reduction in dna binding activity. while the results presented demonstrate that c <dig> and c <dig> are not likely to be the major determinants of redox regulation, the inability to completely re-reduce ku70/80Δc suggested that c <dig> may play some role in redox dependent changes in ku structure.

the dna binding assays performed on the c <dig> mutants and ku70/80Δc under oxidized conditions revealed a near complete loss of dna binding activity. if c <dig> and  <dig> were responsible for the redox regulation, no reduction in dna binding activity would have been observed. demonstration of the loss of binding in two independent assays provides strong evidence that upon oxidation, the protein structure is altered such that it cannot support dna binding. when the proteins were re -reduced, the dna binding ability was largely recovered, again consistent with a modification or alteration in structure being reversible. also, in that the wild type ku and ku 70/80Δc behaved similarly in their recovery suggest that the ku80ctd does not protect any cysteine residues from the redox conditions that affect ku's ability to bind dna. while we observed some discrepancies between the wild type ku and ku70/80Δc anisotropy data and emsa data, this could be explained in the nature of these assays. the anisotropy assay is more representative of a true steady state equilibrium binding assay, where as the emsa is a stopped assay with post -binding separation that can influence the detection of the bound species. this is apparent from the fits of the binding curves for each assay where the emsa quantification yields a clear sigmoidal binding curve as we have previously demonstrated for ku binding short dna duplexes  <cit> . the data obtained from fluorescence anisotropy fits better to a hyperbolic binding curve than the emsa data, consistent with a true equilibrium binding reaction . despite these differences, the results of the redox effects between the wild type and variant proteins are very consistent.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion we observed that under oxidized conditions ku, independent of the mutations, binds dna with a significantly lower affinity than under reduced conditions. we also determined the c <dig> does not play a role in ku-dna interaction nor does it have a role in the affect of redox on the ku heterodimer. analysis of the ku70/80Δc revealed slight differences in activity leading us to believe that this truncation has a modest effect on ku binding dna and potentially a similar effect on ku structure and activity in response to redox conditions.
