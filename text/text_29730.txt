BACKGROUND
salamanders, especially newts, are capable of regenerating tissues, organs and even body parts, such as limbs and tails throughout their adult lives  <cit> . among all tissues that can be regenerated, the lens is a special case. in contrast to removal of a part of limb or tail , the lens can be removed in its entirety. it has also been shown that newts can regenerate the lens very faithfully no matter how many repeated lentectomies are performed or the age of the animal  <cit> . notably, the lens regenerates by another tissue, the pigment epithelial cells of the iris by the process of transdifferentiation. there is, however, a restriction: the lens can only be regenerated from the dorsal iris. even though the ventral iris can be induced experimentally to regenerate a lens, normally it never contributes to the process  <cit> . this restriction can be very instructive when it comes to investigating the mechanisms underlying the process.

the only other vertebrates that have been shown to regenerate the lens are frogs and some fish. in frogs, the process has been studied well and it has been established that regeneration occurs only in pre-metamorphic stages and that the lens is derived from the cornea by transdifferentiation  <cit> . after metamorphosis, the ability for lens regeneration ceases. another salamander, the neonate axolotl, is also capable of regenerating limbs and tails as is the newt. however, in a paper by stone in  <dig> it was concluded that this species is not able to regenerate the lens, even though no staging details were provided  <cit> . we have decided to revisit this issue and have undertaken a detailed study starting with larvae at stage  <dig>  at this stage the eye tissues including the lens have been well differentiated, while other body parts  are beginning to form  <cit> . we find that starting at this stage axolotls, similarly to newts, can regenerate a perfect lens from the iris and that this ability persists for about two to three weeks beyond that stage. after that, the ability for lens regeneration is lost. surprisingly, however, we find that the lens can be regenerated by either the dorsal or the ventral iris. in some cases regeneration occurred from both irises in the same eye. a similar series of experiments employing zebrafish failed to show any evidence that this species can regenerate their lens underscoring the importance of urodeles in the study of lens regeneration.

methods
lentectomy
axolotl larvae  were supplied from the ambystoma genetic stock center  and kept at 27°c. the hatched larvae were fed brine shrimp. larvae were anesthetized in  <dig> % ethyl 3-aminobenzoate  at different stages. using a sharp-edged blade, an incision was made in the cornea, and then the lens was removed in its entirety. at different time intervals after lentectomy, animals were fixed in methanol acetic acid solution  at 4°c overnight and processed for paraffin embedding. similar series were also performed using zebrafish embryos  at different stages. animal care adhered to the guide lines of the institutional animal care and use committee , university of dayton  and of the iacuc, cincinnati children's hospital medical center .

hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry
paraffin sections of  <dig> μm were deparaffinized and used for h & e staining and immunohistochemistry. for h & e staining, hematoxylin  and eosin  were used. to examine cell proliferation in the iris after lentectomy, 5-bromo-2'- deoxyuridine  was injected into larvae  <dig> hours before fixation. sections from brdu injected larvae were treated with 1n hcl for  <dig> minutes at room temperature, blocked in tnb buffer  supplied in the tsa kit  and incubated with mouse anti-brdu antibody  overnight at 4°c, and subsequently washed and incubated with alexa  <dig> conjugated anti-immunoglobulin g   for  <dig> minutes at room temperature. to monitor lens regeneration, sections were incubated with anti γ-crystallin rabbit antibody  and then detected with an anti-rabbit cy <dig> conjugated antibody . immunohistochemistry images were taken using a bx <dig> microscope  with a ccd camera  and imaging software , or by confocal imaging .

RESULTS
based on the embryonic stages of axolotl outlined by armstrong and malacinski  <cit> , we histologically evaluated lens development in embryos as early as stage  <dig>  our evaluation showed that by stage  <dig>  the lenses had developed well with full differentiation of the globe having a clear lens epithelium and lens fibers . since this is the stage at which hatching occurs , we decided to remove the lens at different time intervals after stage  <dig> starting with day  <dig> to day  <dig>  each group was examined at different times after lentectomy to evaluate if animals were able to regenerate their lenses. we found that lens regeneration was possible within a particular time window after lens removal in animals up to  <dig> days after hatching . after that window of time, axolotls were found incompetent of regenerating their lenses. the regeneration process was very fast. within one to two days after lentectomy, a well differentiated lens was present. the frequency of lens regeneration was highest when lentectomy was performed  <dig> or  <dig> days after stage 44; there were 10/ <dig>  and 8/ <dig>  regenerated lenses, respectively. we believe that the failed cases were most likely the result of trauma to the eye due to lentectomy. the eye of the axolotl at these stages is very small and no matter how carefully lentectomy is performed some injury is unavoidable. when we examined later stages, such as  <dig> days past stage  <dig>  axolotls were no longer able to regenerate the lens. in table  <dig> in parentheses we include staging beyond stage  <dig>  according to limb development  <cit> .

in parentheses equivalent stages as described by nye et al. according to forelimb and hindlimb development  <cit> .

hatching is around  <dig> hpf.

histological sections at day  <dig> after lentectomy hinted that the lens regenerates from the iris; however, it could be formed from either the dorsal or the ventral iris. prompted by these findings we decided to analyze lens regeneration in more detail. for this, we removed the lens at stage  <dig> +  <dig> days and analyzed the process of regeneration  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post-lentectomy. three hours before collection, animals were injected with brdu to examine cell proliferation. the collected animals were embedded, sectioned and incubated with brdu antibody as well as with γ-crystallin antibody that marks lens fibers. the histological series are presented in figure  <dig>  in the top panel, sections at  <dig> hour, just after removing the lens, are shown. brdu staining was only observed at the ciliary margin, where proliferating retinal stem/progenitor cells contribute to the growing retina. as expected, γ-crystallin expression is absent. at  <dig> hours post-lentectomy no crystallin synthesis was documented . at  <dig> hours post-lentectomy a lens vesicle positive for γ-crystallin is present. the vesicle becomes more organized and polarized at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours with an anterior region having proliferating lens epithelial cells and a posterior part with differentiating lens fibers. this represents the normal process of lens development as well. interestingly, the lens was elicited from the dorsal iris  or the ventral iris . most surprisingly, however, is that in 2/ <dig>  cases lenses were regenerated from both the dorsal and the ventral iris. the regenerating lens at  <dig> hours originated from the dorsal iris, while the regenerating lens at  <dig> hours originated from the opposite, the ventral, iris . in a different eye, a regenerating lens  <dig> hours after lentectomy was produced from the ventral iris . the lens was attached to the tip of the iris, which was also positive for brdu. the lens epithelium was also positive as expected. the two cases of the double lenses can be seen in figure  <dig>  in figure 5a two lens vesicles derived from both dorsal and ventral iris are depicted and in figure 5b two crystallin-positive lenses can be observed.

our results, thus, convincingly show that lens regeneration is possible in the axolotl larvae. in this respect, there are differences and similarities when axolotl lens regeneration is compared with the same process in frogs and in newts. similarly to frogs, regeneration is possible during a limited time window, but in contrast, the iris is the source of regeneration in the axolotl and not the cornea. similarly to newts, regeneration takes place from the iris pigment epithelium, but in contrast to the newt, it is not restricted to only the dorsal iris, and this capacity is not present at later stages or as an adult.

it is interesting to also note here that the competent stages for lens regeneration coincide with early development of forelimbs and hindlimbs. stage  <dig> is morphologically marked by the development of the forelimb bud  <cit> . the capacity for regeneration is terminated around stage  <dig> which is marked by the beginning of hindlimb bud differenrtiation. while a direct correlation between the two events cannot be made at present, one idea could be that crucial factors for both events act during that time window.

prompted by the axolotl results, we also examined lens regeneration in zebrafish. lens formation in zebrafish with well differentiated anterior lens epithelium and posterior lens fibers occurs within  <dig> hours post fertilization  <cit> . we removed lenses at different stages starting at prim  <dig> , high pec  or long pec  and protruding mouth . hatching begins at high pec stage. in none of the cases was a regenerated lens obtained . given the role of fibroblast growth factor  in zebrafish fin regeneration  <cit>  and in newt lens regeneration  <cit> , we also added this growth factor to zebrafish embryos or to axolotls at non-permissive stages post-lentectomy. fgf failed to induce any regeneration .

taken together our results underscore the importance of newts in the study of lens regeneration. however, the fact that there is a time window in which the axolotl can actually regenerate the lens provides an excellent comparative addition to the study of lens regeneration. recently, the transcriptome of newt lens regeneration has been completed  as well as similar studies during axolotl limb regeneration  <cit> . thus, this technology could be of great value to regeneration studies. it will be of great interest to compare, in the future, the transcriptome of lens regeneration in axolotl  with the newt transcriptome of the dorsal and ventral iris. such analysis can pinpoint crucial regulation underlying induction of lens regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have shown that lens regeneration is possible in the axolotl for a limited period of time. lens can be regenerated between stage  <dig>  and stage  <dig> . our results show that contrary to the newt that regenerates the lens only from the dorsal iris, the lens can be regenerated from either the dorsal or the ventral iris or even from both sites. thus, the axolotl lens regeneration provides evidence for a new developmental plasticity.
