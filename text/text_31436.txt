BACKGROUND
the protein, named alveolar soft part sarcoma locus , was first described as part of an oncogenic fusion protein with a transcription factor in alveolar soft part sarcoma tumors  <cit> . the normal, unfused aspl protein contains an n-terminal ubl domain and a c-terminal ubx domain and orthologues are present in most eukaryotic species. however, the function of the aspl protein remained unknown until it appeared in a functional screen for proteins involved in insulin-stimulated redistribution of the glucose transporter glut <dig>  <cit> . it was shown that aspl binds glut <dig> directly and sequesters glut <dig> to intracellular vesicles in the absence of insulin, and aspl was thus also named tug for “tether containing ubx domain for glut4”  <cit> . further studies revealed that depletion of aspl/tug by sirna also enhances glut <dig> translocation to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake in adipocytes  <cit> . more recently, aspl/tug was shown to regulate assembly of the golgi compartment  <cit> .

previous studies have linked both integral ubl domain proteins  <cit>  and ubx domain proteins  <cit>  to the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and since aspl contains both, it is likely also to play a role in intracellular proteolysis. the structure of the aspl/tug ubl domain has been solved  <cit> . the structure shows the typical ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold, although some differences to ubiquitin, in particular the lack of the hydrophobic patch surrounding ile <dig>  were noted. some ubl domain-containing proteins, such as human bag- <dig>  <cit>  and yeast rad <dig>  <cit> , utilize their ubl domains to interact with subunits of the 26s proteasome. however, the ubl domain is not a general proteasome-interacting domain  <cit>  and binding to unrelated components has been reported  <cit> . in the case of aspl, the ubl domain was recently proposed to become cleaved and function as a novel ubiquitin-like modifier  <cit> .

the ubx domains also resemble ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like domains  <cit> , and with few exceptions, all characterized ubx domains are implicated in binding to the aaa  atpase, known as p <dig> or valosin-containing protein  in mammals and cdc <dig> in yeast  <cit> . structurally, p <dig> resembles another aaa type atpase specifically involved in vesicle fusion, named nsf  <cit> . the p <dig> atpase is a ring-shaped homohexameric chaperone-like complex  <cit> . the monomer is a phylogenetically highly conserved protein that contains two aaa modules, called d <dig> and d <dig>  that couple coordinated atp-hydrolysis to conformational changes of the hexameric complex  <cit> . the atp-driven conformational changes allow p <dig> to physically disassemble protein complexes and segregate proteins from their binding partners  <cit> . this “segregase” activity  <cit>  is probably limited to ubiquitylated proteins and is essential for a number of cellular pathways, including membrane fusion  <cit> , protein degradation  <cit>  and transcription factor maturation through limited degradation  <cit> . although p <dig> may bind ubiquitylated substrates directly  <cit> , a series of p <dig> cofactors that recruit and/or process substrates has been characterized  <cit> . functionally, these cofactors are diverse, and each probably directs p <dig> to a particular cell function. for instance, the ubx domain proteins p <dig> and ubxd <dig> direct p <dig> to functions in membrane fusion  <cit>  and protein degradation  <cit> , respectively.

previous studies have also connected p <dig> and its cofactors with the degradation of misfolded proteins, derived from endoplasmic reticulum , via the er-associated degradation  pathway  <cit> . in this degradation pathway, misfolded secretory proteins are first recognized by er luminal chaperones. then, the proteins are retrotranslocated back to the cytoplasm, ubiquitylated, and finally degraded by the 26s proteasome  <cit> . the energy used to extract the proteins is provided by p97-catalyzed atp-hydrolysis.

the putative yeast orthologue of the human ubx-domain protein aspl, ubx <dig>  has been shown to regulate erad  <cit> , and uv-induced degradation of rna polymerase  <cit> . more recently, it was shown that budding yeast cdc <dig> and ubx <dig> double mutants mislocalize 26s proteasomes into foci at the nuclear envelope  <cit> . moreover, ubx <dig> null mutants display synthetic lethality with deletion mutants in the rpn <dig> transcriptional activator for proteasome subunits and ump <dig>  encoding a proteasome-assembly chaperone  <cit> , suggesting that ubx <dig> regulates proteasome maturation and trafficking.

for our understanding of p <dig>  it is important that we obtain more detailed knowledge of its various cofactors, of which at least  <dig> have been found so far  <cit> . using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we identified aspl as a p <dig> cofactor. our characterization of aspl revealed that aspl is a widely expressed protein that binds directly to p <dig> and nsf. although human aspl only displays weak sequence similarity to its putative yeast orthologue, ubx <dig>  expression of human aspl in a budding yeast ubx4Δ mutant partially rescues the cycloheximide sensitivity and proteasome mislocalization phenotypes in ubx4Δ strains. this suggests that aspl is a functional orthologue of yeast ubx <dig>  however, the erad defect in the ubx <dig> null mutant is not affected by aspl expression, and knock-down of aspl expression in human cells does not lead to a stabilization of the model erad substrates, cd3δ and tcrα. collectively, this suggests that human aspl and budding yeast ubx <dig> are multifunctional proteins that share some, but not all functions.

RESULTS
aspl is a conserved eukaryotic protein that interacts with p97
in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a hela cell cdna library, using human p <dig> as a bait, several ubx domain proteins were found. these included p <dig>  aspl as well as ubxd <dig>  ubxd <dig>  ubxd <dig>  and rep <dig> . previously, most of these proteins have been described in the context of p97-binding, and connected with p97-relevant functions  <cit> . the human aspl protein is 77% identical with its murine orthologue and 47% identical with its orthologue in xenopus laevis . aspl is found in most eukaryotes. the closest homologue to aspl in plants is pux <dig>  a known p <dig> cofactor  <cit> . the putative budding yeast orthologue is ubx <dig>  however, ubx <dig> is only weakly homologous to human aspl  . aspl contains a ubl domain near the n-terminus, and a ubx domain near the c-terminus . in addition, by sequence analyses we found a low homology ubx domain at position 89– <dig> which we named lhu for low homology ubx domain and a putative p97-binding shp-box between residues  <dig> and  <dig>  curiously, the shp box is not conserved in budding yeast ubx <dig> . the ubx domain and shp box are regarded as general p97-interacting modules, indicating that aspl was a valid target of p <dig> in the yeast two-hybrid screen.

to obtain further information on aspl interacting proteins, we performed another round of yeast two-hybrid screening, now using full length aspl as bait. here the isolated clones encoded either p <dig> or the n-ethylmaleimide  sensitive factor . when comparing the p <dig> and nsf clones, we noticed that p <dig> activated the his <dig> reporter gene stronger than did nsf .

in order to confirm the yeast two-hybrid interactions, gst and gst-tagged aspl  were expressed and purified from e. coli. the fusion proteins were used in precipitation experiments with 6his-tagged p <dig> and 6his-tagged nsf, produced in e. coli. gst-aspl precipitated p <dig>  and nsf  whereas, under the same conditions, gst did not, thus confirming that aspl interacts directly with p <dig> and nsf. however, we noted that the aspl-nsf interaction was lost when detergents were included in the buffer system .

to determine if the identified protein-protein interactions also occur in vivo, between the endogenous proteins, we immunoprecipitated aspl from mammalian cell extracts and analyzed the precipitated material by blotting for p <dig> and nsf. indeed, the interaction between p <dig> and aspl was also evident between the endogenous proteins . however, we did not detect any nsf in the immunoprecipitates , even after chemical cross-linking . this suggests that either the aspl-nsf interaction in vivo is weak and/or transient, or that the proteins do not interact in vivo. we therefore decided not pursue the interaction between nsf and aspl further. since aspl contains a ubl domain, and some ubl domain proteins function as proteasome co-factors  <cit> , we also tested if aspl interacts with 26s proteasomes. however, since neither the rpn <dig> subunit of the 19s proteasome complex nor the α-subunits 20s proteasome complex were recovered in the aspl immunoprecipitate, we conclude that apsl is not associated with 26s proteasomes in mammalian cells .

next, we decided to map the interaction between aspl and p <dig>  further gst-precipitation experiments using full length aspl and various aspl truncations  revealed that the c-terminal ubx domain was not able to precipitate p <dig> . curiously, the construct, lacking the ubx domain, did also not co-precipitate p <dig> , indicating that efficient binding to aspl requires an extended central area containing multiple interaction areas. further truncations revealed that the n-terminal half of aspl, containing the ubl and lhu domains, failed to interact with p <dig> , while the central area containing the shp box and ubx domain did bind p <dig> , although with a reduced affinity. further co-precipitation experiments using truncated 6his-tagged versions p <dig>  and full length gst-tagged aspl revealed that aspl interacts with the p <dig> n-domain . we conclude that aspl associates with the p <dig> n-domain via the central area, containing the shp box and ubx domain.

aspl is a widely expressed protein and localizes to the er-membrane
since p <dig> and nsf are connected with a range of basic cellular functions, their cofactors are expected to be widely expressed. however, some p <dig> cofactors display a very narrow tissue expression profile  <cit> . to determine the tissue distribution of aspl on the protein level, we separated protein extracts from various rat tissues by sds-page and probed blots for the presence of aspl. we found that aspl was expressed in all the tested tissues, but was less abundant in kidney .

next, we sought to determine the subcellular localization of aspl. separation of cell lysates into a soluble and insoluble fraction revealed that aspl is largely soluble .

recently, endogenous aspl was shown to co-localize with ergic- <dig> at the er-golgi intermediate compartment  <cit> . in our hands, the commercially available antibodies to aspl were not functional for immunofluorescence microscopy. hela cells were therefore transiently transfected to express full length aspl with a c-terminal gfp-tag. the gfp signal appeared throughout the cells, but was increased at the er, as determined by concurrent staining of the er protein, calnexin .

effect of knock-down of aspl expression
since aspl is a putative orthologue of yeast ubx <dig>  which has been connected to erad  <cit> , the erad pathway might also be impaired in cells with a decreased amount of aspl. to test this prediction, aspl expression was knocked-down with sirna , and the degradation kinetics of the model erad substrates cd3δ-yfp  and tcrα-ha  were analyzed. we observed no significant differences in these substrates degradation kinetics when aspl was lacking . we therefore conclude that aspl, unlike its putative yeast orthologue ubx <dig>  is not involved in erad, at least with these substrates.

aspl complements some defects of a budding yeast ubx4Δ strain
yeast mutants lacking ubx <dig> have been reported to be sensitive to stress conditions, including high temperatures, reducing agents and cycloheximide  <cit> . to test whether aspl is a functional orthologue of yeast ubx <dig>  we examined whether expression of human aspl could rescue the cycloheximide sensitive phenotype of the ubx <dig> deletion mutant in s. cerevisiae. to this end, wild type and ubx4Δ strains were transformed with an expression plasmid encoding aspl and, as a control, an empty vector. under normal conditions, cell growth was not affected by loss of ubx <dig> or expression of aspl . however, expression of aspl  partially rescued the cycloheximide-dependent growth defect of the ubx4Δ mutant , revealing that aspl, at least in part, can remedy the lack of ubx <dig> in ubx4Δ cells. to examine if aspl expression could also alleviate the erad defect in the ubx4Δ strain, we followed the degradation of the erad substrate cpy*. as expected, we found that deletion of ubx <dig> led to an impaired degradation of cpy* . however, ectopic expression of aspl had no effect on the cpy* degradation .

more recently, ubx <dig> was shown to regulate proteasome localization along with cdc <dig>  <cit> . in mammalian cells, proteasomes are distributed throughout the cytosol and nucleus  <cit> , while in budding yeast, proteasomes are enriched in the nucleus  <cit> . we found that proteasomes, as visualized by pre6-gfp, concentrated to a discrete spot when ubx <dig> expression was repressed through gal promoter in the cdc48- <dig> strain . this mislocalization was fully suppressed by ectopic expression of ubx <dig>  and partially suppressed by expression of aspl , revealing that this function is conserved between the yeast and human proteins.

finally, we tested if aspl also affected proteasome localization in human cells. under normal conditions we found proteasomes fairly evenly spread throughout the cytosol and nucleus , and this localization was not changed upon knock-down of aspl expression . hence, either aspl does not regulate the subcellular localization of proteasomes in mammalian cells, or perhaps this function of aspl is redundant with other components in higher eukaryotes.

CONCLUSIONS
recently, it was reported that aspl is required for reassembly of the golgi apparatus  <cit> . on most points, e.g. association with p <dig>  interaction mapping and subcellular localization, our data largely agree with these published results. in addition, we show here that human aspl can partially complement the cycloheximide sensitive phenotype and proteasome mislocalization of budding yeast mutants, devoid of ubx <dig>  however, heterologous aspl expression does not restore erad in the ubx4Δ mutant. thus, unlike ubx <dig>  human aspl is not involved in erad, but rather shares some other cellular functions with ubx <dig>  including regulation of proteasome localization.
