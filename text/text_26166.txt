BACKGROUND
the cornea serves mainly a protective and refractive function, being found on the outermost surface of the eye. it is a highly transparent and strong tissue, separated from the surrounding conjunctiva by a transitional zone - the limbus. during eye development, the cornea is the last part of the eye to be formed. it consists of a stratified epithelium at the surface, stroma in the middle - populated by keratocytes and fibroblast-like cells, and an inner layer of endothelial cells, each separated by a bowman’s and descemet’s membrane, respectively.

the human central corneal epithelial cells  are derived and replaced continuously from the limbal epithelial stem cells . the later can undergo asymmetric division and give rise to transient amplifying cells , which can then differentiate into mature cecs that lose their ability to proliferate  <cit> . animal studies have shown that cecs arise from approximately  <dig> progenitor cells, which means the frequency of lescs is extremely low  <cit> . in humans, the lescs have been found in the limbal epithelial crypts - special niches at the peripheral edge of the cornea  <cit> . only six such crypts have been identified in the limbus, further strengthened by findings from animals  <cit> . the crypts provide a concentrated and safe place for harboring lescs, and also, a rich vascular supply with growth factors and metabolites for their sustained persistence  <cit> . lescs play a key role not only in epithelial differentiation, but also in wound healing, tissue regeneration and maintenance of a balanced immunological state in the cornea  <cit> .

injuries - traumatic, chemical or iatrogenic, or diseases of the lescs, either inborn or acquired, can all lead to partial or total lesc deficiency  or corneal neovascularization accompanied by inflammation. full penetrating keratoplasty is not anymore the mainstay of treatment for lescds, while autologous limbal graft transplantation from a healthy donor eye, if available, does not provide a guarantee for the functionality of the graft itself. isolation and ex vivo expansion of autologous or homologous lescs in human-like conditions has only been described in detail in the last couple of years  <cit> . we recently published a method for cultivating and characterizing lescs grown on lens capsule in a medium containing human serum as the only growth supplement  <cit> . the benefit of our method is not only the use of animal material-free culturing conditions, but also, the ability to investigate the phenotype and the genotype of the outgrowing cells, which can further help identify new putative lesc markers.

in the present study, we compare the gene expression patterns of ex vivo cultured human lescs to differentiated cecs with a main focus on markers for stemness and proliferation, epithelial differentiation, tissue development and growth, immunological and angiogenic factors. in addition, we propose a way to identify and possibly concentrate these stem cells found at low density from the heterogeneous cell populations found in the cornea for future use in clinical transplantation.

methods
ethics statement
all tissue collection complied with the guidelines of the helsinki declaration and was approved by the regional ethical committee . limbal tissue collection was done within 12 hours of biologic death from cadavers only and hungary follows the eu member states’ directive 2004/23/ec on presumed consent practice for tissue collection  <cit> .

isolation and cultivation of lescs and cecs
in brief, after a thorough eye wash with 5% povidone iodine , the conjunctiva was incised and separated from the limbal junction; consequently, a  <dig> × 1 mm rectangular-shaped limbal graft was dissected away and towards the cornea, respectively, at the  <dig> o’clock position. the depth of the graft was kept superficial or within the epithelial layer; multiple grafts were collected from a single eye and tested for growth potential. the graft dissection was performed using a lamellar knife placed tangential to the surface being cut. lescs were cultured in a high-glucose dulbecco-modified eagle’s medium  supplemented with 20% v/v human ab serum, 200 mm/ml l-glutamine,  <dig>  u/ml penicillin- 10 mg/ml streptomycin  at 37°c, 5% co <dig> in  <dig>  cm <dig> tissue culture plates, while the medium was changed every alternate day. the growth of the cells was monitored under phase contrast microscope regularly. only grafts which had cell outgrowth within 24 hours were processed further to decrease the chance of fibroblast contamination and maintained in culture up to 14 days when they reached 95-100% confluence. differentiated cecs were scraped from the central part of the cornea of cadavers and were used as a positive control. to avoid contamination of one or the other cell type during isolation, different donors were used for each isolation carried out.

microarray and data analysis
affymetrix genechip human gene  <dig>  st arrays  were used for the microarray analysis. the array contained more than  <dig>  gene transcripts. for the whole genome gene expression analysis 150 ng of total rna was subjected to ambion wt expression kit  and genechip wt terminal labeling kit  according to the manufacturers’ protocols. after washing, the arrays were stained using the fs- <dig> fluidics station  and signal intensities were detected by hewlett packard gene array scanner  <dig> 7g . the scanned images were processed using genechip command console software   and the cel files were imported into partek genomics suite software . robust microarray analysis  was applied for normalization. gene transcripts with a maximal signal values less than  <dig> across all arrays were removed to filter for low and non-expressed genes, reducing the number of gene transcripts to  <dig>  differentially expressed genes between groups were identified using one-way anova analysis in partek genomics suite software. clustering analysis was made using the same name module in a partek genomics suite software.

pathway analysis
to identify the relationships between selected genes, the ingenuity pathway analysis  was used. excel datasheets containing gene ids with the assigned gene expression values were uploaded into the program. the ingenuity pathways knowledge base  provided all known functions and interactions which were published in the literature. anova was used to calculate a p-value to determine the probability that each biologic function or canonical pathway assigned to the data set was due to chance alone. for the representation of the relationships between the genes, the ‘pathway designer’ tool of the ipa software was used.

measurement of cytokine concentrations by elisa
lescs growing out of the limbal grafts were trypsinized  and seeded onto 24-well plates at a 5× <dig> cell/ml density. cells were cultured for  <dig> to 13 days. at the end of the culturing period, the supernatants were harvested and kept at −20°c until further measurement. bd opteia elisa  assay kits were used following the supplier’s instruction to measure the concentration of secreted il- <dig> and il- <dig> cytokines. each experiment was performed at least three times and each sample was tested in triplicates. statistically significant differences were determined by paired student’s t test.

transmission electron microscopy
human corneal tissue procurement and use were conducted in accordance with local regulations and approved by the research ethics committee of king saud university. unless specified otherwise, reagents were obtained from taab laboratories equipment ltd . pieces of lescs grown on lens capsules were fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in  <dig>  m phosphate for 2 h at 4°c. tissues were processed at low temperatures and were embedded in lr white resin  at −20°c for 48 h under ultraviolet light. ultrathin sections were collected on  <dig> mesh formvar-coated carbon nickel grids and examined in a jeol  <dig> transmission electron microscope .

surface protein level analysis by flow cytometry
fluorescein isothiocyanate , phycoerythrin  and allophycocyanin  conjugated antibodies were used for multicolour flow cytometric analysis to measure the selected surface protein expression on isolated lescs and differentiated cecs. antibodies against cd29/integrin β <dig>  cd44/hcam, cd <dig>  cd54/icam <dig>  cd <dig>  cd90/thy- <dig>  cd117/c-kit and cd146/mcam markers were used in a concentration specified by the manufacturer’s protocol . all samples were labeled for 30 minutes on ice, then measured by facscalibur flow cytometer  and the data were analyzed using flowjo , software. the results were expressed as means of positive cells  ± sd. statistically significant difference between the two groups  was determined with paired student-t test and a value of p <  <dig>  was considered significant.

RESULTS
gene array and ipa analysis
a microarray based transcriptional profiling was used to compare lescs to differentiated cecs. the intensity profiles of the log <dig> transformed signal values of the  <dig> transcripts were obtained, out of which  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts had a more than  <dig> fold change  increase and decrease in expression between the two cell types, respectively . table  <dig> summarizes the most affected signaling pathways identified by the ipa software based on the significant expression of genes in the lescs. the top canonical pathways included genes involved in hepatic fibrosis, angiogenesis inhibition by thrombospondin  <dig> , retinoic acid receptor  activation, antigen presentation and axonal guidance signaling. some of the signaling pathways were also related to diseases or toxicological pathways such as induction of reactive metabolites, renal ischemia and renal proliferation. ipa could determine the biological functions and diseases from the significantly changed expression levels of groups of genes:  <dig> molecules were found to be involved in cancer development,  <dig> in cellular growth and proliferation,  <dig> in cellular development,  <dig> in cell death and survival and  <dig> in gastrointestinal diseases. only a small number of molecules related to visual system development and function , and  <dig> involved in increased levels of albumin could be detected. .

ipa software was used to calculate the canonical pathways from the gene expression profile of lescs grown on lens capsule.

customized gene array data – upstream regulators
we selected  <dig> upstream regulators that were expressed significantly and differentially in lescs that were also related to our groups of interest . their biological functions were extensively related to physiological maintenance of lescs, while the molecules involved in these processes showed significant inter-donor differences. figure  <dig> shows the heatmap and the functional clustering of the  <dig> upstream regulators selected on the basis of their high or low fc or previously documented relation to lescs. the cluster analysis demonstrated a clear distinction between the lescs and our control cecs. the genes that were mostly affected were involved in ion-, nucleotide- or protein binding, protein secretion as well as receptor or enzyme activities. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> up- or down-regulated genes within these gene groups.

customized gene networks – upstream regulators
stemness and proliferation
as seen in figure  <dig>  out of the  <dig> upstream regulators,  <dig> were related to stemness and, in particular, mesenchymal stem cells . the expression pattern also demonstrated a clear difference between the lescs and the cecs . these genes coded for transcription factors, surface molecules, cytokines and growth factors, all playing a key role in the maintenance of multipotency, proliferation capacity of hematopoietic and/or mscs . up- and down- regulation was found in  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively, and within the custom selected gene cluster, the  <dig> highest upstream regulators were: ccna <dig> , il1b , gdf <dig> , icam <dig> , tgfb  sox <dig>  vim , nt5e  tgfbr <dig>  and bmp <dig> , while the  <dig> most down-regulated were: bmp <dig> , lef <dig> , gja <dig> , kat2b , klf <dig> , egf  foxn <dig> , sox <dig> , gdf <dig>  and hspa <dig> . the expression of these selected genes strengthen our previous findings that the ex vivo cultured lescs show great similarity to mscs regarding their surface marker profile and the extracellular matrix  production ability  <cit> . the present comparison is rather focused on the differences between lescs and differentiated cecs in their transcriptional factor patterns, making the lescs more progenitor-like, yet with a limited multipotency potential as compared to other stem cells, including bone marrow-derived mscs . as expected, our data show that lescs have a higher proliferation potential and stemness-related gene expression than differentiated cecs. the sry related hmg-box family members sox <dig> and sox <dig>  both involved in chondrogenesis and proliferation, were down-regulated in the lescs. flow cytometric surface protein level analysis found a significantly higher number of positive cells for icam <dig> in cecs  than in lescs   . no difference could be found in the well-known msc surface markers, such as cd <dig> ) and cd <dig> ; data shown are mean ± sd), while more cells expressed the stem cell factor receptor cd117/c-kit in the lescs  compared to cecs  at a protein level, however, this difference was not statistically significant  due to a high inter-donor variance .

differentiation
our previous phenotype analysis of lescs showed the heterogeneity of this population  <cit> , so we analyzed  <dig> genes related to terminal and epithelial differentiation. the heatmap of these transcripts with the clustering of the expressed genes show a clear segregation of the lescs from the differentiated cecs . among them, growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, transcription regulators and enzymes can be found . transcriptional regulators such as foxg <dig> , foxd <dig> , myod <dig> and osgin <dig>  were all down-regulated in contrast to the foxa <dig> and pmel up-regulation . the pericellular matrix proteoglycan decorin coding gene dcn  was found to be down-regulated in lescs. within the collection of cytokines and growth factors which play a role in epithelial differentiation, bmp <dig> , fgf <dig> , fgf <dig> , il <dig>  and igf <dig>  were down-, while il1b , inhba , il1a , tgfb <dig> , ereg , bmp <dig>  and dkk <dig>  were up-regulated . at a protein level, cd146/mcam, a key player in mscs differentiation, was found not to be expressed on the surface of cecs  compared to lescs  . presence of ck <dig> on lescs has been described by our group previously  <cit> .

cell adhesion
to further distinct the multipotent lescs within the heterogeneous population of epithelial cells, surface markers including ecm-cell, cell-cell adhesion and cell migration proteins were used as putative markers. the upstream regulators of  <dig> genes coding for molecules involved in cell adhesion were analyzed. . the first subgroup contained highly expressed transcriptional factors and transmembrane receptors in the lescs : tgfbi , akt <dig> , ctgf , map2k , spp <dig>  and src . six genes including akt <dig> , nov , rock <dig> , prkca , hras  and prkcb  were down-regulated. the next subgroup , included integrins, cell adhesion molecules , proteolytic enzymes and matrix metalloproteases  – all involved in the ecm breakdown and tissue healing and remodeling; the most up-regulated genes in this cluster were mmp <dig> , mmp <dig>  and mmp <dig> , while mmp <dig> was down-regulated . the laminins, which are important proteins in the basal membrane and their coding genes such as lama <dig> , lama <dig>  and lamc <dig>  were all up-regulated in the lescs. cams and tight junctions which are very important in cell-cell adhesion and tissue organization, such as icam- <dig> , cav <dig>  and cldn <dig>  were up-, while gja <dig>  was down- regulated. in particular, cdh <dig> , important in desmosomal junction formation and stratified epithelium transformation was up-regulated, and the desmosome formation between the lescs grown on lens capsule could be demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy . altogether, the expression of  <dig> integrin-coding genes was different between the lescs and the differentiated cecs -  <dig> out of them were up-, while  <dig> were down- regulated. surface protein level analysis found no difference between lescs and cecs in the expression of cd29/integrin β <dig> , and cd44/hcam  expression. the percentage of cd <dig> positive cells, which plays a role in cell viability and immunoregulation, was significantly higher in lescs  compared to cecs  , showing higher viability and inhibition of phagocytosis in the lescs .

angiogenesis
 <dig> molecules were detected in the dataset which may have a role in pathological angiogenesis in the cornea . this set contained transcription factors, enzymes and cytokines including angiogenic growth factors as well . the fibronectin gene , which is important in new vessel sprout formation, had the highest up-regulation , followed by serpine <dig>  and mmp <dig> . the coagulation factor iii  gene f <dig>  was also highly expressed in the lescs. the most down-regulated genes were plg , timp <dig> , foxo <dig> , tgfbr <dig>  . certain cytokines and growth factors which are also important in angiogenesis  were up-regulated in the lescs: ilb <dig> , c-x-c motif chemokine  <dig>  cxcl <dig> , tgfb <dig>  and vegfa . in addition, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  two very potent angiogenic cytokines, were up-regulated in these cells: il- <dig>  and il- <dig> , similar to edn <dig> , ereg  and bmp <dig>  up-regulation within this cluster. only four of the angiogenic cytokines were down-regulated in the lescs: acidic fgf - fgf <dig> , il17f , tgfb <dig>  and kitlg .

discussion
absence or removal of the lesc layer in animals can cause defective corneal epithelialization, indicating the essential importance of these cells in corneal surface biology and regeneration  <cit> . in humans, besides injuries and diseases, dysfunction or lesc loss can lead to lescd; other causes, such as genetic diseases can cause abnormal development of the anterior segment and the limbus, while steven johnson syndrome, chronic limbitis or ocular pemphigoid are inflammatory processes which can lead to lescd, similar to cytotherapy, radiation or surgery in the limbal region  <cit> . altogether, a plethora of causes can lead to decreased transparency of the cornea, inflammation and corneal neovascularization , resulting in a serious and painful disease with subsequent loss of vision  <cit> . the inflammatory processes and the angiogenesis very likely change the environment, so that the small niche of stem cells becomes non-functional  <cit> . therefore, the treatment of lescd with ex vivo cultured and functional lescs is becoming widely accepted today  <cit> . many other types of cells, including embryonic stem cells, bone-marrow and wharton jelly-derived stem cells have been attempted for lescd treatment in animal models with relatively good outcomes  <cit> . most cell-based therapies in the clinical practice, however, use limbal epithelial cells cultured on 3 t <dig> mouse feeder fibroblast supplemented with fetal calf serum  <cit> . the risk of murine  viral transmission during such procedures is not yet known  <cit> . although the limbal epithelial cells cultivated on mouse feeder cells can replace the wounded epithelial cells, the mechanism how they make the local tissue more suitable for its own stem cells to recover their stemness and differentiation potential has been unknown  <cit> . this seemingly “gold standard” cell therapy method would not be able to compete with human animal material-free product that would be ideal for clinical use. furthermore, the overall success rate of the above therapies has been reported to be 76%  <cit> , although, the right quantity of cells needed for recovery has not yet been reported. in stem cells based therapies, the purity of the product  is crucial for the outcome  <cit> . lescs lose their multipotency during epithelial expansion and differentiation  <cit> , therefore, it is important to distinguish between lescs, tams and cecs within the cell culture used for therapy. in our cell cultures, the sry related hmg-box family member sox <dig> was up-regulated, while sox <dig> expression was down-regulated, indicating no chondrogenic differentiation but high proliferative capacity of the lescs. furthermore, s100a <dig> and a <dig> proteins have been found to be potent markers of limbal epithelial crypt cells  <cit>  - in our lescs,- the s100a <dig> was down-regulated indicating they are not crypt cells. others have reported that cxcl <dig>  col2a, isl <dig>  foxa <dig>  ncam <dig>  acan, gjb <dig> and msx <dig> can be used as putative markers to identify lescs  <cit> . we could not confirm a difference in these genes between the lescs and the differentiated cecs, with the exception of foxa <dig> which was up-regulated and gja <dig> down-regulated . similarly, wnt <dig>  wnt <dig>  wnt <dig> and wnt16b have been reported to be typically expressed in the limbal region and to be important for the lescs proliferation  <cit> . we could confirm that wnt <dig> and wnt5a expression was up-, while wnt3a was down- regulated in our lescs, along the wider lines of the results mentioned above. surface protein level analysis found higher positivity for cd146/mcam, cd <dig> and cd117/c-kit in lescs compared to cecs, showing a pattern typical for stem cells and higher multipotency in the earlier cell type . this phenotype analysis further proved simply using classical msc markers, such as cd90/thy- <dig> and cd <dig>  it is not possible to differentiate between the two cell types.

lescs play a key role in limbal tissue healing and remodeling, a process which usually starts with ecm breakdown  <cit> . the latter is mediated by mmps, which were up-regulated in the lescs and their pattern implicates a preferred degradation of collagens to rebuild the ecm  <cit> . laminins and vitronectin are typically found in the limbal basal membrane  <cit>  and their genes were up-regulated in our lescs.

for attachment to new ecm proteins, integrins and cams are also essential, the expression of which is typical for the tissue of origin. indeed, the integrin expression is able to define the cell phenotype and seems to be useful in classifying mscs from various tissues besides the well-known msc markers we have reported before  <cit> . the results of our gene array data analysis strengthen the fact that lescs cultured in medium containing human serum as the only growth supplement can keep their integrin and cam pattern that relates them to their limbal tissue phenotype. surface protein level analysis found same expression levels of cd29/integrinβ <dig> and cd44/hcam in the two cell types, while cd54/icam <dig> positivity was higher in the cecs .

wound healing can often lead into angiogenesis, which can have a very important and controllable pathological role in the limbus  <cit> . fibronectin is an important ecm protein in expanding cells as well as angiogenesis, mediating sprouting, de novo vessel formation and endothelial progenitor/stem cells differentiation into endothelial cells  <cit> . the two highest up-regulated gene products found in our lescs seem to have an opposite effect on the angiogenesis pathway: il-1β can induce-, while cxcl <dig> can inhibit the formation of new vessels  <cit> . interestingly, human limbal epithelial progenitor cells have been found to express cxcl <dig>  <cit>  while its absence could decrease the level of il- <dig> in mice corneas  <cit> . the expression of tgfb <dig> is very important in wound healing and in inducing vegf expression, which was also up-regulated in the lescs, capable of provoking angiogenesis in the damaged tissue  <cit> . endothelin- <dig> has many direct and indirect angiogenic effects upon the endothelial cells and fibroblasts - it provokes the release of the pro-angiogenic compounds like vegf from endothelial cells and stimulates the fibroblasts to produce pro-angiogenic proteases  <cit> . altogether, our results indicate that both pro- and anti-angiogenic genes are expressed at the same time or in a balanced way in lescs, maintaining an avascular state in the normal cornea. loss of this control can be initiated by either a decreased production of anti-angiogenic molecules or increased production of pro-angiogenic and inflammatory factors. although transplantation of lescs has been known to suppress corneal inflammation and angiogenesis, the molecular mechanism how lescs participate in the processes has not yet been fully understood  <cit> . limbal niche cells have been found to have a differentiating ability towards angiogenic progenitors and inhibition of endothelial differentiation of lescs  <cit> .

il- <dig> and il- <dig> can be secreted by many cell types during inflammation or differentiation. these cytokines play a role in inflammation, angiogenesis and msc differentiation-related processes  <cit> . their gene expressions were up-regulated in lescs: il- <dig>  and il- <dig> . using the ipa analysis, the il- <dig> signaling pathways were further confirmed of being present in our lescs compared to cecs, together with some other well-known pathways described below . the first such pathway or network affected is the il-1β and tnfα mediated release of il- <dig> from activated cells. this signaling is further mediated by nfκb and jnk  transcriptional factors and can lead to il- <dig> and il- <dig> release in parallel to collagen type i production , which is the major component of connective tissue. the second network affected is the autocrine or il-6-mediated-il-6-secretion through raf <dig>  map2k and erk1/ <dig>  this process needs to be initiated by the il- <dig> receptor , however, the jak-stat pathway  can also induce release of angiogenic factors such as vegf and activation of sox <dig>  as shown before in our dataset, il1b was highly up-regulated with a  <dig>  fold change hand-in-hand with its receptor il1r <dig>  and il1a . although a subunit of the receptor for il- <dig> coding gene was down-regulated - il6r , a member of the type i cytokine receptor family - oncostatin m receptor , was found to be highly up-regulated  in the lescs. this receptor can form heterodimers with gp <dig>  which is a signal transducer for il6r. it can also provide an intracellular signal through janus kinases after ligand binding. in addition, many other ligands can be associated with gp <dig>  such as il- <dig>  ciliary neurotrophic factor , leukemia inhibitory factor  and cardiotrophin  <dig> . activation of ras and mapk signaling can then be connected to the il-1β mediated pathway. in our dataset, socs <dig> was up-regulated , while socs <dig> was down-regulated . four mapks were slightly up-regulated in the lescs: map2k <dig> , mapk <dig> , mapk <dig>  and mapk <dig> , while the members of the nfκb pathway were down-regulated: nfkb <dig>  and nfkbia . cxcl <dig> with high amount of il- <dig> has been shown to induce migration of trophoblasts through activation of the cxcr <dig> receptor  <cit> . interestingly, cxcl <dig> was among the highest up-regulated genes  in the lescs compared to cecs .

the pathways in which il- <dig> participates are in general more complex than for other cytokines. il- <dig> can be produced by any cell possessing toll-like receptors during inflammation, and it is one of the most known chemotactic factors for neutrophils and activator of immune cells  <cit> . . in addition, il- <dig> has been described as potent pro-angiogenic cytokine especially in the eye  <cit> , although the molecular background of such angiogenic processes has not been well described. il- <dig> can bind to g protein-coupled serpentine receptors such as cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> and beside immunological activation, it can induce rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins, increase the expression of vcam and icam <dig>  and the migration as well as vessel formation of endothelial cells and stem cell-like endothelial progenitor cells, in parallel with increase in vascular permeability .

our gene expression data which indicate that il- <dig> and il- <dig> participate in most of the networks or selected pathways analyzed correlate well with the measurements of their secreted levels in the supernatants of the cultured lescs. the level of these cytokines was continuously high in the culture supernatants at days  <dig>  and  <dig>  with no significant difference at both time points  . for comparison, the physiologic level of il- <dig> in the tear fluid of human subjects is very low  . il- <dig> can participate in many stem cell-related processes and has been found to be important in maintaining the needed niche for lescs and lesc-epithelial interaction  <cit> . in bone marrow-derived stem cells, il- <dig> is needed for immunosuppression, which effect of the lescs has been described with different possible mechanisms  <cit> .

overall, our gene selection and networks are somewhat different from the well-known canonical pathways described so far because they were generated de novo and were based on our data and the already published networks from literature. it remains to be further investigated and confirmed whether these pathways are reflected in the same manner at protein level both ex vivo and in situ, giving a possibility of finding a specific phenotype and genotype profile for lescs. these can clearly be beneficial in treating ocular surface diseases and discovering innovative therapies aided by the gene array technology.

CONCLUSIONS
the human eye as an organ possesses great potential for regeneration and cell therapy, in particular, its corneal surface which contains lescs. identifying molecular markers and upstream regulators in the lescs using genome-wide microarray transcriptional profiling, as well as verification of those at protein expression level can provide a better identification and more specific understanding of the signaling molecules associated with these cells, therefore, better application ocular surface disease treatment. overall, we found that the human lescs play a crucial role in cellular movement and adhesion, epithelial differentiation and tissue repair, as well as angiogenesis and extracellular matrix integrity.
