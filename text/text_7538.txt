BACKGROUND
rna-protein interaction plays an important role in various biological processes, such as protein synthesis, gene expression, posttranscriptional regulation, and viral infectivity. the prediction results of rna-binding sites in proteins can provide biological insights for investigating rna-protein interaction. for instance, the ribosome is a protein synthesis complex consisting of ribosomal rnas  and proteins. sunita et al.  <cit>  applied predicted rna-binding sites to study the relationship between rna methyltransferases rsmc and 16s rrna. in addition, bechara et al.  <cit>  incorporated predicted results from a rna-binding site predictor to inspect the connection between fragile x mental retardation protein and g-quartet rna structure. moreover, some rna viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus  and hepatitis c virus, have a rna genome and replicate themselves by interacting with host proteins  <cit> . therefore, identification of the rna interacting residues in proteins provides valuable information for understanding the mechanisms of protein synthesis, gene regulation, and pathogen-host interaction.

in recent years, rapid advances in genomic and proteomic studies have yielded a tremendous amount of dna and protein sequences. we used the keyword "rna-binding" to search against the national center for biotechnology information  protein sequence database on june  <dig>   <dig>  and obtained  <dig>  protein sequences. however, when searching against protein data bank   <cit>  for molecular/chain type containing protein and rna, we only retrieved  <dig> structures. in addition, experimental determination of rna-protein interaction remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. therefore, computational approaches for predicting rna-binding sites in proteins have become increasingly important to understand the mechanisms of rna-protein interaction.

previous work
extensive studies of rna-protein binding site prediction have lead to the development of several methods, which can be classified as follows.

 <dig>  amino acid composition-based methods
jeong et al.  <cit>  used an artificial neural network  to predict rna-protein interacting residues based on amino acid compositions and predicted secondary structure elements. it achieved matthew's correlation coefficient  of  <dig>  and overall accuracy of  <dig> % along with specificity of  <dig> % and sensitivity of  <dig> %. terribilini et al.  <cit>  presented rnabindr using a naïve bayes classifier on amino acid sequences to predict rna binding sites in proteins. rnabindr attained mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %, 93% and 38%, respectively.

 <dig>  evolutionary information-based methods
jeong and miyano  <cit>  applied an ann to predict the rna interacting residues based on evolutionary information from the position-specific scoring matrix , and achieved mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the mcc is further improved to  <dig>  by the incorporation of weighted profiles. kumar et al. proposed a predictor, pprint  <cit> , using pssm profiles in a support vector machine  model, and it achieved mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.

 <dig>  hybrid methods
wang and brown  <cit>  developed an svm-based classifier, bindn, using features including relative solvent accessible surface area, hydrophobicity index, side chain pka value, molecular mass, and blast results. the overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of bindn are  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively.

challenges
although many methods have been proposed for rna-binding site prediction, several challenges still remain. first, many of previous methods yield low sensitivities in tradeoff for high specificities since some biological applications, such as identification of critical residues for site-specific mutagenesis, emphasize more on specificities rather than sensitivities  <cit> . these methods could suffer from low coverage of rna-binding sites in high-throughput proteomic analyses. second, the mcc values of existing methods remain in the range of  <dig> ~ <dig> , which presents a great scope for improvement in the complementary measure of prediction performance. finally, in most methods parameters such as the size of the sliding window are selected from test results evaluated by n-fold cross-validation, which may lead to overestimation of the prediction performance. thus, the performance would be worse if a more rigorous procedure is applied for parameter selection and performance evaluation.

our method and future applications
in this study, we propose a method, rnaprob , for prediction of rna-binding residues in proteins using svm classifiers and a new smoothed pssm encoding scheme. besides incorporation of upstream and downstream residues in a standard pssm generated by psi-blast, smoothed pssm encoding also considers, for each amino acid in a sequence, the dependency effect from its neighboring amino acids. similar to the spatial domain method used in the research field of image processing  <cit> , smoothed pssm encoding calculates the evolutionary information of a central position based on the sum of those from surrounding residues. experimental results show that the prediction performance of smoothed pssm encoding performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark data sets. evaluated by five-fold cross-validation, rnaprob outperforms the other approaches by  <dig> ~ <dig>  in mcc,  <dig> %~ <dig> % in overall accuracy, and  <dig> %~ <dig> % in specificity. most notably, our method significantly improves sensitivity by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for the rbp <dig>  rbp <dig>  and rbp <dig> data sets, respectively. to avoid data overfitting, we also incorporate a three-way data split procedure to evaluate the prediction performance of rnaprob. our results show that our method not only achieves significant improvement on the performance, but also attains a high prediction accuracy evaluated by a three-way data split procedure. moreover, our analysis indicates that smoothed pssm could serve as a more discriminative feature for distinguishing between interacting and non-interacting residues. we believe that the proposed encoding scheme could be applicable to other research fields, such as dna-binding sites, protein-protein interaction, and prediction of posttranslational modification sites.

methods
data sets
in this study, we apply three data sets used in previous studies to compare the performance of our method and other systems. table  <dig> shows a summary of these data sets, which are detailed as follows and available in the supplementary material .

 <dig>  rbp86
the rbp <dig> data set consists of  <dig> protein chains extracted from rna-protein complexes with x-ray crystallography resolution better than  <dig> Å in pdb. sequence redundancy in the data set is removed so that no protein pair has a sequence identity greater than 70%. in the rna-protein complexes, a residue is regarded as interacting with rna if the distance between an rna molecule and the residue in the protein is less than  <dig> Å. the resultant data set contains  <dig>  rna interacting residues and  <dig>  non-interacting residues. the rbp <dig> data set has been used in terribilini et al.  <cit>  and kumar et al.  <cit> . in kumar et al., it is also referred to as the "main" data set.

 <dig>  rbp109
the rbp <dig> data set contains  <dig> protein sequences obtained from  <dig> rna-protein complexes with x-ray crystallography resolution better than  <dig>  Å in pdb. for any two protein chains, the sequence identity is no more than 30%. the numbers of interacting and non-interacting residues are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the rbp <dig> data set is downloaded from rnabindr web server  <cit> . in terribilini et al.  <cit> , this is named as the "rb109" data set.

 <dig>  rbp107
derived from  <dig> rna-protein complexes in pdb, the rbp <dig> data set is comprised of  <dig> protein chains with x-ray crystallography resolution better than  <dig>  Å and sequence identity no more than 25%. based on the cut-off distance of  <dig>  Å, the rbp <dig> data set contains  <dig>  interacting residues and  <dig>  non-interacting ones. wang and brown  <cit>  applied this data set to construct and evaluated their approach. in kumar et al.  <cit> , it is referred to as the "alternate" data set.

support vector machines 
svm is a machine learning approach proposed by vapnik  <cit>  based on structural risk minimization principle of statistics learning theory. it can be used to deal with classification or regression. distinguishing rna binding residues form non-binding residues in a protein could be regarded as a binary classification problem. for a set of given input data vectors xi  with labels yi , the mission in the training procedure is to optimize the following equation that maps input vectors into a higher dimensional feature space , and seeks a separation hyperplane with a maximum margin to divide positive instances from negative ones. the calculation of svm is defined in equation .

  minw,b,ξisubject to yi+b)≥1−ξi,ξi≥ <dig> i= <dig> ,...,n, 

where w ∈ ℝd is a weight vector, b is a bias , and Φ is a mapping function. for more flexible classification, svm allows instance i positions at the wrong side of hyperplane with slack variable ξi and cost parameter c. in svm, a kernel function k, such as linear, polynomial, radial basis function , and sigmoid function, is used to present Φ·Φ where xi and xj are two data vectors. in this study, we use rbf as the kernel function in the svm. the formulation of rbf is defined in equation , where γ is a training parameter.

  k = exp 

developed by lin et al.  <cit> , libsvm is a powerful and well-known svm package used by many researchers. we apply libsvm to implement our classifiers for prediction of rna-binding sites in proteins.

feature extraction and representation
evolutionary information has been shown to be effective for rna-binding site prediction  <cit> . for this reason, we use psi-blast  <cit>  to search against ncbi non-redundant  database and generate a pssm based on blosum <dig> substitution matrix  <cit>  for each protein with e-value as  <dig>  and iteration number as  <dig>  a pssm is comprised of l vectors , in which contain the log-likelihoods for different amino acids in a position. next, we illustrate two different encoding schemes to represent the pssm.

 <dig>  standard pssm encoding scheme
standard pssm has been used for rna-binding site prediction by kumar et al.  <cit> . for a pssm profile, the feature representation of a residue αi at position i in a protein sequence is presented by an evolutionary information vector vi comprised of log-likelihoods for  <dig> different amino acids. considering the surrounding residues of αi, we apply a sliding window of size w to incorporate the evolutionary information from upstream and downstream neighbors. the feature vector of a residue αi is represented by / <dig> ..., vi,..., vi+/2). for the n-terminal and c-terminal of a protein, / <dig> zero vectors, consisting of  <dig> zero elements, are appended to the hand or tail of a pssm profile. the feature values in each vector are normalized to a range between - <dig> and  <dig>  in our study, we apply different sliding window sizes ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> with a step as  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows an example of standard pssm of a protein with e-value as  <dig>  and iteration number as  <dig> in psi-blast.

 <dig>  smoothed pssm encoding scheme
in addition to the consideration of neighbors of a residue αi, we propose a new encoding scheme to incorporate the dependency of surrounding residues. in a standard pssm profile, the log-likelihood at each position is calculated based on an assumption that each position is independent from the others. however, terribilini et al.  <cit>  observed that rna binding residues tend to occur in clusters. their analysis revealed that 95% of interacting residues in the rbp <dig> data set have at least one additional interacting residue among the four amino acids on either side, and 49% of those have at least four. inspired by the consideration of adjacent pixels used in the spatial domain method from the research field of image processing  <cit> , we present a new encoding scheme to model the dependency or correlation among surrounding neighbors of a central residue. similar to the feature representation in standard pssm encoding, we use a sliding window of size w to incorporate the evolutionary information from upstream and downstream residues. in the construction of a smoothed pssm, each row vector of a residue αi is represented and smoothed by the summation of ws surrounding row vectors / <dig> + ... + vi + ... + vi+/2). for the n-terminal and c-terminal of a protein, / <dig> zero vectors, are appended to the hand or tail of a smoothed pssm profile. using the smoothed pssm encoding scheme, the feature vector of a residue αi is represented by / <dig> ..., vsmoothed_i,..., vsmoothed_i+/2). the feature values in each vector are normalized to a range between - <dig> and  <dig>  here, we apply different smoothing window sizes from  <dig> to  <dig> with a step as  <dig> . figure  <dig> illustrates an example of a smoothed pssm profile. at position  <dig>  the corresponding value of amino acid 'a' represented by a smoothed pssm encoding is the sum of .

window size selection and parameter optimization
in order to optimize the performance of rnaprob, we have to determine the best combination of several parameters, including the sliding window size w, cost parameter c and kernel parameter γ in the svm classifier, the smoothing window size ws, and the weight parameters w <dig> and w- <dig> in svm. table  <dig> shows the workflow of window size selection and parameter optimization. in our study, the best parameters are optimized with respect to overall accuracy. first, we test the performance of different sliding window sizes w from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ...,  <dig> in standard pssm encoding scheme using default c and γ parameters in svm, and initial weight parameter w <dig> as  <dig> and w- <dig> as the ratio of the number of non-interacting residues to that of interacting residues in a data set. as shown in table  <dig>  the ratios of the numbers of non-interacting residues to those of interacting residues in the rbp <dig>  rbp <dig>  and rbp <dig> data sets are 1: <dig> , 1: <dig> , and 1: <dig> , respectively. second, based on the optimized sliding window size w selected from the first step, the best combination of cost parameter c and kernel parameter γ is determined with initial weight parameters. the log2c and log2γ ranged from - <dig> to  <dig> and - <dig> to - <dig>  respectively. third, the prediction performance of different smoothing window sizes ws ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with a step  <dig> is evaluated using initial weight parameters and previously selected parameters . fourth, due to data set imbalance, the weight parameters w <dig> and w- <dig> are tuned with optimized w, c, γ, and ws. after these steps, the optimal parameters, including sliding window size w, cost parameter c, kernel parameter γ, smoothing window size ws, and weight parameters w <dig> and w- <dig>  are determined.

# in the rbp <dig> data set, we test w <dig> ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> .

system architecture
the system architecture of rnaprob is shown in figure  <dig>  given a protein sequence, rnaprob performs the following steps:

 <dig>  apply psi-blast to generate a standard pssm of the protein.

 <dig>  generate a smoothed pssm of the protein using an optimized smoothing window size.

 <dig>  construct a feature vector for each residue in the protein sequence by an optimized sliding window size, and normalize all feature values in the vector into a range of - <dig> and  <dig> 

 <dig>  use a trained svm classifier with optimized parameters  to predict the interacting and non-interacting residues in the protein.

after the above steps, rnaprob outputs the corresponding interacting or non-interacting state of each residue in the protein.

training and testing
the performance of rnaprob is assessed by n-fold cross-validation and three-way data split. to compare with other approaches, we use five-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of rnaprob. however, to prevent data-overfitting, a three-way data split procedure is applied to assess our predictor. the performance of rnaprob is evaluated as follows.

 <dig>  n-fold cross-validation
a data set is randomly divided into five distinct non-overlapping sets of positive and negative instances , four of which are used to train the predictor and the accuracy of the predictor is evaluated on the remaining set. this procedure is repeated five times.

 <dig>  three-way data split
to avoid over fitting, we use a more stringent three-way data split procedure  <cit>  to evaluate the performance of rnaprob. a data set is randomly partitioned into three non-overlapping sets: a training set for classifier learning, a validation set for parameter selection, and a test set for performance evaluation. in this paper, we divide a data set into five distinct sets, three for training, one for validation, and one for testing. the procedure is also iterated  <dig> times.

performance evaluation measures
for comparison with other approaches, we follow the measures used in previous work  <cit> , including specificity , sensitivity , mcc  <cit> , and overall accuracy . specificity and sensitivity measure how well the binary classifier recognizes negative and positive cases, respectively. a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 100% imply that the classifier identifies all non-interacting residues as non-interacting and all interacting residues as interacting, correspondingly. when a predictor's specificity increases, its sensitivity often decreases. on the other hand, mcc, which considers both under- and over-predictions, gives a complementary measure of the prediction performance, where mcc =  <dig> denotes a perfect prediction, mcc =  <dig> indicates a completely random assignment, and mcc = - <dig> means a perfectly reverse correlation. moreover, overall accuracy presents how well the classifier distinguishes true positives and true negatives, and 100% overall accuracy denotes a perfect prediction. the definitions of specificity, sensitivity, mcc, and overall accuracy are defined in equations , , , and , respectively. in the equations, tp, tn, fp, and fn denote the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, correspondingly.

  specificity = tn/ ×  <dig> 

  sensitivity = tp/ ×  <dig> 

  mcc=/××× 

  acc = / ×  <dig> 

in addition to the above measures, we also use the receiver operating characteristic  curve  <cit>  and area under the roc curve   <cit>  to evaluate the performance of standard and smoothed pssm encoding schemes. in an roc curve plot, the x-axis represents false positive rate  and y-axis denotes true positive rate . we incorporate different thresholds in the svm classifier to plot the true positive rates against false positive rates in an roc curve. moreover, auc calculates the area under an roc curve and the maximum value of auc is  <dig>  which denotes a perfect prediction. a random guess results in an auc value close to  <dig> .

to determine the thresholds in the svm classifiers, we follow the criteria used in the previous work. we notice that the thresholds in other approaches are optimized with respect to different measures. for example, kumar et al.  <cit>  and jeong and miyano  <cit>  both optimized their results in the rbp <dig> data set based on mcc. in addition, terribilini et al.  <cit>  also selected the thresholds with the best mcc for the rbp <dig> data set. on the other hand, wang and brown  <cit>  determined the best thresholds in the rbp <dig> data set based on the average of specificity and sensitivity. therefore, the thresholds in rnaprob are optimized with respect to mcc for the rbp <dig> and rbp <dig> data sets, while the threshold is determined by the average of sensitivity and specificity for the rbp <dig> data set.

RESULTS
effect of smoothed pssm encoding scheme
here we compare the performance of smoothed pssm and standard pssm encoding scheme in terms of mcc, overall accuracy, roc curve, and auc for the benchmark data sets. table  <dig> shows the performance comparison of standard pssm and smoothed pssm using five-fold cross-validation and three-way data split. evaluated by five-fold cross-validation, smoothed pssm encoding scheme attains overall accuracy of  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % compared to  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % by standard pssm encoding for the rbp <dig>  rbp <dig>  and rbp <dig> data sets, respectively. moreover, smoothed pssm encoding scheme achieves improvements of  <dig> ~ <dig>  in mcc compared to standard pssm. similarly, assessed by three-way data split, smoothed pssm encoding also performs better than standard pssm in terms of both overall accuracy and mcc in the three data sets.

§ the performance of incorporating a three-way data split procedure is shown in the parentheses.

experimental results demonstrate that our proposed smoothed pssm encoding scheme not only achieves good prediction performance, but also yields a significant improvement over standard pssm encoding. smoothed pssm encoding scheme outperforms standard pssm by  <dig> %~ <dig> % in overall accuracy and  <dig> ~ <dig>  in mcc. the consideration of dependency among neighboring residues works well in distinguishing interacting residues from non-interacting ones; accordingly, the prediction performance of smoothed pssm encoding scheme is substantially improved. this supports our assumption that the incorporation of the correlation between surrounding residues in pssm profiles can significantly enhance the performance of rna-binding site prediction.

rnaprob prediction performance on the benchmark data sets
for each data set, we used five-fold cross-validation and three-way data split to evaluate the prediction performance, which is detailed below and summarized in table  <dig> 

 <dig>  performance comparison with other approaches on the rbp <dig> data set
the window sizes, including the sliding window size w and smoothing window size ws, and other parameters in rnaprob are selected with respect to overall accuracy. first, figure  <dig> shows the overall accuracy of applying different sliding window sizes on the rbp <dig> data set. the overall accuracy evaluated by both five-fold cross-validation and three-way data split grows rapidly before it reaches 77%. however, a slow growth in the overall accuracy is observed as the size of sliding window is greater than  <dig>  thus, the sliding window size w is set as  <dig> for the rbp <dig> data set. next the prediction performance of different smoothing window sizes based on previously determined sliding window size  is illustrated in figure  <dig> and  <dig>  in figure  <dig>  although there is a very slow growth in the overall accuracy, we observe that mcc is improved from  <dig>  to  <dig>  when the size of smoothing window is increased from  <dig> to  <dig>  nevertheless, the performance improvement in mcc  is not significant as the size of smoothing window is greater than  <dig>  similar trends in mcc and overall accuracy are also observed in figure  <dig>  therefore, we use  <dig> as the smoothing window size ws in our method. as shown in table  <dig>  the performance of rnaprob evaluated by five-fold cross-validation achieves mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, , respectively. besides, using a more rigorous three-way data split procedure, our method also attains mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, , correspondingly. the experimental results of window size selection and parameter optimization on the rbp <dig> data set are shown in the supplementary material .

the performance comparison with two other approaches developed on the same data set is shown in table  <dig>  jeong and miyano  <cit>  used an ann to incorporate evolutionary information and obtained mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. the mcc of their proposed method was further improved to  <dig>  based on a weighted profile approach. in addition, kumar et al. developed pprint  <cit> , which incorporated pssm profiles in an svm model, and attained mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> %, respectively. compared to these approaches, our method not only achieves high overall accuracy but also significantly improves the sensitivity by  <dig> %~ <dig> % using five-fold cross-validation. moreover, rnaprob achieves  <dig>  in mcc, compared to  <dig>  by pprint and  <dig>  by jeong and miyano.

 <dig>  performance comparison with other approaches on the rbp <dig> data set
the prediction performance of different sliding and smoothing window sizes on the rbp <dig> data set is demonstrated in figure  <dig>  similar to the rbp <dig> data set, we observe that the overall accuracy converges as sliding window size is greater than  <dig> on the rbp <dig> data set in figure  <dig>  moreover, the mcc shows a slight peak when the smoothing window size reaches  <dig> in figure  <dig>  thus rnaprob also selects w as  <dig> and ws as  <dig> for this data set. as illustrated in table  <dig>  our method reaches  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % in mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity by five-fold cross-validation , respectively. in addition, rnaprob also attains mcc, overall accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of  <dig> ,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % by three-way data split , correspondingly. the detailed experimental results on the rbp <dig> data set are summarized in the supplementary material .

discussion
physicochemical preferences of interacting and non-interacting residues
in this section, we examine the physicochemical properties of rna interacting and non-interacting residues. figure  <dig>  , and  <dig> show the amino acid compositions of interacting and non-interacting residues in the rbp <dig>  rbp <dig>  and rbp <dig> data sets, respectively. it is observed that interacting and non-interacting residues show preferences for different amino acids. rna interacting residues tend to have high compositions for arginine , asparagine , glutamine , glycine , histidine , and lysine . for example, there are relatively high proportions for arginine  and lysine , which may interact with negatively charged rna with their positive side chains. in addition, the smallest amino acid, glycine , also has a high composition in interacting residues because it rotates easily and provides flexibility to interact with rna molecules. moreover, positively charged histidine  can have an aromatic interaction with rna molecules due to its specific pka value and imidazole ring. on the other hand, non-interacting residues show slight preferences for alanine , aspartic acid , glutamic acid , isoleucine , leucine , phenylalanine , and valine . cysteine , aspartic acid , and glutamic acid  are favoured by non-interacting residues because of their negatively charged side chains. in addition, although kumar et al.  <cit>  reported that aspartic acid  showed no preference for interacting or non-interacting residues in their main data set , we observed that the aspartic acid  composition of non-interacting residues is significantly higher than that of interacting residues in both of the rbp <dig> and rbp <dig> data sets. our analysis indicates that the finding from kumar et al. could be a bias from the data set.

to further analyze the physicochemical properties of the rna interacting and non-interacting residues, each amino acid is classified into one of the four groups: acidic , basic , polar , and non-polar   <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the grouped amino acid compositions of interacting and non-interacting residues for the benchmark data sets. it is observed among the three data sets that basic and polar amino acids tend to interact with rna, and acidic and non-polar amino acids are not favoured by rna molecules. particularly, our analysis shows that the compositions of basic amino acids exhibit significantly over-represented patterns for interacting residues.

furthermore, we inspect the amino acid compositions of proteins that interact with different rna molecules. the proteins in the rbp <dig> data set are divided into four categories according to the definition in terribilini et al  <cit> . figure  <dig>  , , and  <dig> show the amino acid compositions of  rrna,  mrna, snrna, dsrna, and sirna,  trna, and  viralrna, respectively. it is observed that viralrna group shows a different amino acid composition compared to the other groups. proteins that interact with viralrna evolve fast and induce conformational changes in the active sites. thus, these proteins exhibit a specific mechanism to interact with viralrna.

comparison of smoothed pssm and standard pssm
here we examine the correlation between interacting and non-interacting residues for both smoothed pssm and standard pssm encoding schemes. we incorporate pearson correlation coefficient   <cit>  to measure the correlation between the evolutionary information of interacting and non-interacting for an amino acid. for each amino acid a, we use two vectors, x and y, to present the sum of pssm evolutionary information vectors for interacting and non-interacting amino acid a, respectively. the pearson correlation coefficient for a series of n measurements for variables x and y is defined in equation .

CONCLUSIONS
we present rnaprob, which combines a new smoothed pssm encoding scheme with a svm model for prediction of rna-binding sites in proteins. in a standard pssm profile, evolutionary information is calculated based on an assumption that each position is independent of others. however, the correlation or dependency from surrounding residues is incorporated in the proposed smoothed pssm encoding. experimental results show that the prediction performance of smoothed pssm encoding performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches on the benchmark data sets. evaluated by five-fold cross-validation, rnaprob outperforms the other approaches by  <dig> ~ <dig>  in mcc,  <dig> %~ <dig> % in overall accuracy, and  <dig> %~ <dig> % in specificity. most notably, our method significantly improves sensitivity by  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for the rbp <dig>  rbp <dig>  and rbp <dig> data sets, respectively. performance improvement in rnaprob not only demonstrates that smoothed pssm can better resolve the ambiguity in discriminating rna interacting and non-interacting residues, but also supports our assumption that consideration of correlation between neighboring residues can significantly enhance prediction accuracy. to prevent data over fitting, a rigorous three-way data split procedure is incorporated to evaluate our prediction performance. the proposed method can be used in other research topics, such as dna-binding site prediction, protein-protein interaction, and prediction of posttranslational modification sites.
