BACKGROUND
gene expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level as a means of ensuring the proper localization and timing of developmental processes in eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . in a diverse set of pathways, a central feature of this post-transcriptional control involves specific binding to target rna sequences by proteins belonging to the signal transduction and activation of rna/grp <dig>  sam <dig>  gld- <dig>  family. star protein-rna interactions are important for translational silencing of genes necessary for germline fate in hermaphrodite c. elegans worms by the regulatory star protein gld- <dig>  <cit> , mrna localization and subsequent development of central nervous system components in mice by quaking   <cit>  and pre-mrna binding by yeast bbp  and mammalian splicing factor  <dig>  proteins as precursors for splicing into mature mrna  <cit> .

members of the star/gsg protein family share a high degree of sequence similarity in the so-called star domain, defined by a central kh domain situated between two homologous domains to the mouse quaking gene, called qua <dig> and qua <dig>   <cit> . the kh and qua <dig> domains provide an extended platform for rna binding, as seen in the structure of the truncated sf- <dig> star domain in complex with single-stranded rna, while qua <dig> facilitates star homodimerization in the presence or absence of rna  <cit> . although an intact structure of a full star domain has yet to be determined, a recent crystal structure reveals that the gld- <dig> qua <dig> domain forms a helix-turn-helix motif which defines the homodimerization interface  <cit> , while a solution structure of the free kh-qua <dig> rna binding region from the xenopus quaking protein provides additional information on the overall topology of this domain in the absence of a bound ligand  <cit> .

in c. elegans, gld- <dig> initiates the formation of a multi-protein repression complex that silences tra- <dig> translation by binding the 3' untranslated region  of tra- <dig> mrna within 28-nt regulatory elements called tges   <cit> . gld- <dig> optimally recognizes a 5'-uacuca-3' consensus sequence in the tge plus an upstream dinucleotide contributes to the overall binding energy  <cit> . a comprehensive mutational analysis further identified other permissible nucleotide sequences that gld- <dig> binds with slightly lower affinity  <cit> , and numerous potential targets for gld- <dig> mediated regulation have since been identified by the presence of a relaxed consensus hexamer with the sequence 5'-aua-3' in the 5' or 3' utrs of these mrnas.

a similar hexameric target was also identified for the mouse quaking protein  having the sequence 5'-naua-3'  <cit> . in vivo, qk- <dig> facilitates the proper sub-cellular localization and expression of myelin basic protein  in glial cells as a direct result of interactions with consensus binding sites in mbp mrna  <cit> . qk- <dig> binds substantially tighter to a 5'-uaauaa-3' consensus, different than gld- <dig> in the strong preference for adenosine at both the third and fifth positions  <cit> . subsequent reports expanded the qk- <dig> binding site to include additional upstream or downstream partial consensus sequences, although the role of these elements in qk- <dig> binding remains less well understood  <cit> .

sf- <dig> is another well-characterized star protein which recognizes a 5'-uacuaac-3' consensus in the branch point sequence  rna that is identical within the sequence parameters delineated for gld- <dig> and qk- <dig>  <cit> . additionally, sam <dig> and the sam68-like proteins slm- <dig> and slm- <dig> recognize bipartite rna elements that resemble the canonical consensus sequences bound tightly by gld- <dig> and qk- <dig>  <cit> .

based largely on sequence homology, novel star proteins have been identified whose functions and biological roles remain largely uncharacterized. one such protein called star- <dig>  is thought to be a functional gld- <dig> homolog expressed in c. elegans somatic tissues. in a recent report, star- <dig> was shown to play an important role in c. elegans development by facilitating alternative splicing patterns in let- <dig> mrna and regulating expression of let- <dig>  <cit> . given the 67% sequence identity with gld- <dig> in the star domain , it seemed likely that star- <dig> would bind similar rna target sequences as gld- <dig> and so may perform an analogous regulatory role. to test this, a combination of gel mobility shifts and fluorescence-polarization was used to assess whether star- <dig> binds tge rna with an affinity and specificity comparable to gld- <dig>  interestingly, star- <dig> binds a similar consensus as gld- <dig>  but more closely resembles qk- <dig> in the strong preference for adenosine at the third and fifth consensus positions. the relative competitive efficiency of mutant 12-mer rna sequences containing a single hexamer site was then tested against star- <dig> bound to a modified tge rna in the more appropriate consensus site background.

gel mobility shifts and fluorescence-polarization were then used to further detail the contributions of individual hexamer consensus positions for high-affinity binding by gld- <dig> and qk- <dig>  because wild-type tge does not contain the consensus sequence most preferred by qk- <dig>  a modified tge rna with the tightest binding qk- <dig> consensus was used as a probe in a competition fluorescence-polarization assay to better define the sequence requirements for high-affinity rna interactions. the role of full and partial consensus elements situated upstream or downstream of a canonical hexamer was also examined in a variety of rna backgrounds. these results indicate that a single consensus hexamer is sufficient for tight binding by star proteins and additional upstream or downstream consensus elements may enhance binding depending on the sequence and positioning.

RESULTS
star- <dig> binds tge rna with high affinity
star- <dig> shares a high degree of sequence identity with gld- <dig> in the star domain region  and sequence similarity suggests that star- <dig> may represent the somatic homolog of the germline gld- <dig> protein in c. elegans. to address this, the kd between the star- <dig> star domain  and wild-type tge rna  was determined both by gel mobility shift  and fluorescence-polarization . star-2-star binds tge rna with  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> ±  <dig>  nm affinity by these methods, respectively. these values are similar to the previously reported kd for gld- <dig> using gel shift   <cit>  and are within error to a measured kd of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm for gld- <dig> by fluorescence-polarization , suggesting that star- <dig> binds tge rna in a manner comparable to that of gld- <dig>  while star- <dig> and gld- <dig> bind tge rna with similar affinities and the sequence identity between these two proteins suggested a similar binding site, the sequence requirements for binding still needed to be determined.

determination of star- <dig> binding specificity
competition fluorescence-polarization was used to probe the nucleotide sequence identity of the consensus recognized by star- <dig> with the same 12-mer tge rna library used previously for gld- <dig>  <cit> . each 12-mer rna, containing a single nucleotide substitution in the wild-type 5'-uacuca-3' consensus, was tested for it's ability to interfere with a star-2-star/tge complex. of the  <dig> rnas, only two point mutations in the 12-mer library, c19a and c21a, bind as tight or tighter than wild-type tge half-site, 4-fold and 20-fold for each substitution , respectively .

interestingly, because gld- <dig> binds only slightly tighter to the 12-mer c21a variant , the 20-fold preference by star- <dig> for an adenosine at the fifth position more closely resembles qk- <dig>  which binds the c21a half-site 41-fold tighter by this method  <cit> . similarly, wild-type 12-mer competes relatively poorly for binding to star-2-star, 7-fold weaker than the 28-nt tge self-competition  while the c21a 12-mer binds nearly  <dig> fold better than the full-length tge  just as with qk- <dig>  furthermore, star-2-star binds the c19a 12-mer 4-fold tighter than the wild-type half-site, similar to that seen for this rna by qk- <dig>  while gld- <dig> has a slight preference for cytidine at this position over adenosine. star- <dig> binds most tightly to rna sequences containing the consensus 5'-uaua-3', identical to the high-affinity consensus binding site for qk- <dig>  but still within the sequence parameters of the relaxed consensus identified for gld- <dig> 

next, both emsa and fluorescence-polarization were used to measure the kd between star-2-star and 28-nt tge rna containing the c21a substitution in the consensus . star-2-star binds c21a tge with  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig> ±  <dig> nm affinity by each method, respectively, which is essentially identical to the affinity of qk-1-star for this rna . for comparison, gld-1-star binds c21a tge rna only slightly tighter than wild-type tge by fluorescence-polarization , which agrees well with the 12-mer competition binding results indicating that gld- <dig> is relatively indifferent to either cytidine or adenosine at that position.

to more effectively define the contribution of each nucleotide for high-affinity star- <dig> binding, a competitor library of  <dig> oligonucleotides, synthesized in a background containing the 5'-uacuaa-3' consensus sequence optimal for star- <dig>  was used for competition fluorescence-polarization . in this assay, no single point mutation competes effectively with the 28-nt c21a tge for binding star-2-star except for the a <dig> half-site 12-mer. neither the wild-type tge half-site with the a to c "reversion" mutation or c19a was found to bind with high-affinity when the bound probe contains adenosine at the fifth position. in addition, star- <dig> prefers uracil at the first position, but all other nucleotide substitutions compete within 5-fold affinity of the a <dig> half-site.

qk- <dig> and star- <dig> bind identical hexanucleotide consensus sequences
qk- <dig> recognizes sites in the utrs of target mrna transcripts, binding tightest to consensus hexamer sequences containing adenosine rather than cytidine at the fifth position. here, qk-1-star binding affinity for wild-type tge rna  or the c21a variant   was compared by direct titration using both fluorescence-polarization  and gel mobility shift . qk- <dig> binds much tighter to 28-mer rnas containing a 5'-uacuaa-3' hexamer, which is underscored by the five-fold tighter binding to c21a tge rna than wild-type seen by fluorescence-polarization and nearly 41-fold tighter binding as measured by emsa .

competition fluorescence-polarization was then used to measure the ability of each mutant 12-mer rna, representing all  <dig> point mutations in the preferred 5'-uacuaa-3' consensus, to compete against the 28-nt c21a tge variant in complex with qk-1-star. in this assay, qk-1-star has a slight preference for uracil at the first position  but will tolerate any of the other three nucleotides nearly as well . interestingly, no other single mutant 12-mer competes measurably with the c21a tge rna, including a21c  and c19a, the only effective competitor being the a <dig> half-site 12-mer rna . these results highlight that the strongest determinant for high-affinity binding is a hexameric sequence with adenosine at the fifth position, as even c19a does not confer any additional binding specificity in this context.

upstream elements contribute to high-affinity binding by qk-1
in addition to a hexanucleotide consensus, gld- <dig> recognizes an upstream 5'-ua sequence in the tge   <cit> . partial consensus elements situated upstream or downstream of a canonical hexamer in rna sequences bound tightly by qk- <dig> have also been noted previously, although the quantitative importance of the upstream 5'-ua for qk- <dig> binding to tge rna has not been determined  <cit> . a modified tge rna in the 5'-uacuaa-3' consensus background was created by substituting 5'-cuc for the upstream partial consensus 5'-uaa element . this rna was used in a gel mobility shift assay to measure the binding affinity to qk-1-star by direct titration . qk-1-star binds the 5' mutant tge rna with roughly 6-fold reduced affinity compared to the c21a tge  but still considerably tighter than to wild-type tge rna. this result is consistent with the modest contribution of this upstream element for gld- <dig> binding to tge rna and further indicates that a 5'-uauaa-3' hexanucleotide consensus is the most important feature for high-affinity binding by qk- <dig> 

alternative mutations in mbp consensus restore high-affinity binding by qk-1
previously, ryder et al. described the gld- <dig> and qk- <dig> high-affinity binding sites as consensus hexamer sequences  <cit> . in a subsequent report based on in vitro selection, the qk- <dig> binding site was expanded to include a "half-site" positioned upstream or downstream of a consensus hexamer that further defined the star binding consensus as a bipartite element  <cit> . in that report, nucleotides surrounding the hexanucleotide consensus were viewed as crucial for qk- <dig> recognition because binding was virtually abolished when either the core hexamer or "half-site" was mutated in one of the high-affinity binding sites found in myelin basic protein  mrna. this led the authors to conclude that both the core and "half site" must be critical for high-affinity binding if mutations in either one rendered qk- <dig> unable to bind. however, we propose as an alternative that these particular core and "half site" mutations caused unforeseen secondary structure changes in mbp rna that prevented qk- <dig> from binding by potentially masking the high-affinity hexameric consensus site.

to address this issue, the consensus core and "half-site" elements were both altered using more conservative mutations, and these mbp rna variant sequences were tested for binding to qk-1-star in a gel mobility shift assay . the wild-type sequence represents 31-nt surrounding the second of five consensus binding sites previously identified in the 3' utr of mbp rna  <cit> . this rna contains a 5' "core" consensus with sequence 5'-cacuaa-3' and a downstream 3' "half-site" with sequence 5'-uaac-3', as previously described  <cit> . qk-1-star binds this rna tightly and the presence of a second distinct shifted complex in the gel indicates that an additional qk-1-star dimer may bind as well . the first and second binding events have measured affinities of  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm and  <dig> ±  <dig> nm, respectively, suggesting that qk- <dig> binds one site preferentially. in effect, either could be considered the preferred consensus site since a second high-affinity hexameric consensus element with sequence 5'-aaauaa-3' is seen by including nucleotides just upstream of the 3' "half-site". this second shifted complex also appears in the previously published gel for this rna, although only a single binding constant of  <dig> nm was reported  <cit> .

as previously noted, qk-1-star does not bind mbp rna when the 5' consensus site is changed from 5'-cacuaac-3' to 5'-cucggug-3' or when the 3' "half-site" is altered from 5'-aaauaac-3' to 5-aguggaa-3' . a direct titration gel shift was used to monitor the ability of qk-1-star to bind mbp rna with these mutations. qk-1-star binds the 5' mutant  relatively weakly  in this assay while virtually no binding was observed to the 3' mutant  in accordance with previous results  <cit> .

these results seemingly contradict the idea of a hexanucleotide consensus as the primary specificity determinant for qk- <dig> binding. both mbp:2-5'm <dig> and mbp:2-3'm <dig> have valid hexanucleotide elements, but it seemed possible that introduction of multiple g residues in an a/u rich rna sequence might result in the formation of secondary structures that inadvertently sequester the hexanucleotide element. indeed, rna secondary structure predictions using mfold  <cit>  suggest that both mbp:2-5'm <dig> and mbp:2-3'm <dig> contain highly stable structured regions that mask the high-affinity binding sites in these rnas . furthermore, tight binding to these sequences is restored when more conservative mutations are made in either the 5' or 3' sites. replacing the 5' half-site with the sequence 5'-cucucuc-3'  results in nearly 5-fold tighter binding  when compared to mbp:2-5'm <dig>  similarly, qk-1-star binds tightly to mbp:2-3'm <dig> and the two distinct complexes seen in the gel have measured kd values of  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm for the first and second shifts, respectively. these values are nearly identical to that for wild-type mbp: <dig> rna and neither of these mutant rnas contain the stable secondary structures in mfold predictions as seen for mbp:2-5'm <dig> or mbp:2-3'm <dig>  in addition, by simply adding multiple guanosine residues to the 5' end of the tge in order to facilitate in vitro transcription using t <dig> polymerase, gld- <dig> binding was essentially abolished, presumably due to formation of stable secondary structures in the rna . taken together, these results suggest that mbp: <dig> rna contains two independent consensus binding sites and that only one is necessary for qk- <dig> to bind with high-affinity. in addition, qk- <dig> is indifferent to the positioning of the consensus site as it bound the full-length mbp rna with roughly the same affinity when either the 5' or 3' consensus sites were mutated.

gld-1-star binds tighter to rna with two consensus hexamers
one poorly understood aspect of this system is the mode that homodimeric star proteins employ when binding target rna sites, since structural models are based largely on the solution structure of monomeric human sf- <dig> in complex with branch point sequence  rna  <cit> . sf- <dig> lacks the qua <dig> region and does not dimerize, making the structure only illustrative as a model for rna binding by a single star monomer  <cit> . furthermore gld- <dig>  qk- <dig> and star- <dig> bind much tighter to their target rna sequences than sf- <dig> does to its consensus rna in vitro, and this difference may be due in large part to the extra binding energy attained from recognition of additional rna elements by the second protomer.

competition fluorescence-polarization was used to address this issue by measuring the affinity of gld-1-star for various tge rnas, truncated so as to contain zero, one or two consensus hexamers . the tra- <dig> mrna 3'-utr contains two 28-nt tge repeats each with a single consensus hexamer, plus an additional hexamer encompassing part of the conserved 5'-cuca-3' in the linker separating the two tges. neither of the two tge truncations lacking a consensus element  compete well with the fluorescently-labeled 28-nt tge for gld-1-star binding. when compared to self-competition with the 28-nt tge, 1- <dig> and 56- <dig> bind  <dig> and 32-fold weaker, respectively, underscoring the necessity of a hexamer consensus for high-affinity binding.

gld-1-star binds the tge half-site rna  containing one consensus hexamer roughly 9-fold weaker than the tge. this is consistent with the previously measured values for this rna by both fp and emsa  <cit> . weaker binding to the half-site is likely due to the lack of any additional recognition elements in the shorter 12-nt rna since tight binding is restored with the longer 46- <dig> rna, which has both a consensus hexamer and a downstream uaa element. gld-1-star binds this rna nearly ten-fold tighter compared to the half-site and binds as tightly as to the full 28-nt tge . among these sequences, gld-1-star binds the tightest to the 14- <dig> rna containing two consensus hexamers , binding this rna nearly  <dig> -fold tighter than the tge 28-mer.

consensus site spacing is acceptable over a broad range
as a homodimer, both protomers should be equally competent for binding a consensus element in the context of a dual hexamer rna. however, it remained unclear whether enhanced binding occurs only when the consensus sites are spaced within a certain permissible range. to this end, a library of rna constructs was developed that placed either one or two canonical hexamers at different locations within a poly-uridine background and were tested for binding to gld-1-star by competition fluorescence-polarization . the 28-nt tge sequence is 54% uridine  and a 28-mer rna consisting entirely of uridine does not compete for gld-1-star binding .

addition of one 5'-uacuca-3' hexamer in the poly-u background at either the 5' or 3' end resulted in a kiapp of  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm or  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm, respectively, which is similar to that observed for the half-site 12-mer  containing a single hexamer and also consistent with the affinity of gld-1-star for tge rna with mutations in the upstream ua element  <cit> . addition of a second hexamer restores tighter binding to a similar level as that of the 28-nt tge when there is a 4-nt spacing between hexamers . binding affinity is 2-fold weaker than tge rna when the hexamers are directly adjacent to each other  or with a 2-nt spacer . a spacing of six to twelve nucleotides between hexamers was optimal for tight binding with kiapp values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nm for a 6-nt and 12-nt spacing, respectively.

in the same 28-nt poly-u rna background discussed above, various dinucleotide sequences were then inserted upstream of a single consensus hexamer and the contributions of these smaller sequence motifs to gld- <dig> binding affinity were evaluated by competition fluorescence-polarization . none of the partial motifs recapitulated the effect of adding a second consensus hexamer, although three combinations of dinucleotide substitutions reflect a portion of a relaxed consensus element. adding an upstream aa or ac  was the most preferred, with a kiapp of  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm and  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm, respectively, but both are still nearly 8-fold reduced compared to the addition of a consensus hexamer . interestingly, rna with the c9a <dig> substitution  does not bind tighter than 5'-uuuuuu-3'  even though this substitution places half of a 5'-uacuca-3' consensus upstream of the full hexamer. of the other sequences tried, c7a <dig>  and a6c <dig>  compete with a kiapp of  <dig>  ±  <dig> and  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm, respectively, indicating that these sequences do not enhance gld- <dig> dimer binding when only a single consensus element is present.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
star/gsg proteins regulate the expression of developmental genes in eukaryotes by binding specific sites in target mrna transcripts. in c. elegans worms, gld- <dig> binds to tge rna and regulates tra- <dig> translation, while in mice, qk- <dig> binds mbp rna and ensures the proper sub-cellular localization and expression of myelin. both gld- <dig> and qk- <dig> bind tightly to a similar hexameric consensus element within their respective rna targets but require different sequences for optimal binding . although there remains no clear explanation as to what is responsible for the distinct binding specificities of gld- <dig> and qk- <dig>  this difference likely plays a role in the regulatory activity of each protein by preferred rna target site selection in vivo.

this has been useful for identifying binding sites in potential rna regulatory targets and for helping us to initially characterize the rna binding activity of newly recognized star proteins. for example, star- <dig> was initially identified as a potential gld- <dig> homolog in c. elegans somatic tissues. in this report, it was established that star- <dig> and gld- <dig> bind similar hexameric consensus sequences  and so may regulate gene expression in an analogous fashion. although star- <dig> binding is tightest to a consensus hexamer that more closely resembles the sequence preferred by qk- <dig> rather than gld- <dig>  this is consistent with the model that most star proteins recognize similar specificity determinants in the 5' or 3' utr regions of target rnas.

although the consensus sequence requirements vary for each individual star protein, all of those studied in detail necessitate a hexameric consensus element at a minimum in order to bind rna with high-affinity. however, while not an absolute requirement for tight rna binding, upstream or downstream partial consensus elements play an integral role in high-affinity star binding that remains somewhat less understood. for instance, mutations in partial consensus sequences found in tge and mbp rna have an adverse effect on both gld- <dig> and qk- <dig> binding, respectively  <cit> . however, these results further validate the idea that only one hexameric consensus site is absolutely necessary and that upstream or downstream partial consensus elements play a secondary, but not essential role for high-affinity binding by star proteins.

one possible explanation for this suggests that partial consensus sequences may provide a binding platform for the second protomer of a star homodimer in a bound complex with rna. in this case, the rna has two unequal binding sites such that one star protomer binds the canonical consensus hexamer in a similar manner as that seen in the solution structure of sf- <dig> bound to rna  while the other protomer would bind the second partial consensus site in a novel fashion. the model showing the qua1-mediated dimer interface was based on the crystal structure of the gld- <dig> qua <dig> domain  <cit>  with the kh domains modeled after the orientation seen in the nova kh domain crystal structure  <cit> . the dashed line in figure 7a shows the approximate path of the contiguous rna through the kh-qua <dig> region, as would be the case for the tge. a symmetric star homodimer shown schematically in figure 7b presents two equal rna binding surfaces and would necessarily bind tge rna asymmetrically as in figure 7c. in this case, mutations in the upstream partial consensus that may render the second protomer unable to bind result in a weaker star protein-rna complex, consistent with that seen for both gld- <dig>  <cit>  and qk- <dig> 

most of the competition experiments described here involved assessing binding affinities using 12-mer rnas containing only a single hexamer. it is possible based on this model, in which each protomer is equally competent for binding a consensus hexamer, that a star dimer may simultaneously bind two rna 12-mers with each protomer recognizing a consensus hexamer in a symmetric fashion . this has been termed the symmetric hexamer binding model and it may also describe the mode of binding to a dual hexamer rna, such as that employed by gld- <dig>  as learned in this report, gld- <dig> binds tightly to poly-u rna containing two consensus hexamer sequences and the permissible spacing between hexamers varies over a fairly wide range. symmetric binding is possible in this case only if the intervening rna sequence is of sufficient length to properly orient the two consensus binding sites. since gld- <dig> binds the tightest to rna with two consensus hexamers spaced between  <dig> and 12-nt apart, it is possible in this context for the rna to be oriented such that each protomer interacts with a consensus hexamer in an identical manner. these binding consensus studies should prove useful for defining potential targets for the individual star proteins.

other possible models that may explain high-affinity binding must take into consideration the likely orientation of the star protomers and the positioning of rna elements that may contribute differentially to the binding energy of the complex. this highlights the difficulty in describing the interaction between star dimers and target rna sequences without the benefit of a high-resolution structure. hopefully, efforts currently underway to describe the structure of a full star domain will provide more insight on the mode of high-affinity rna binding by star proteins in general.
