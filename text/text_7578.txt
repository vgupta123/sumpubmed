BACKGROUND
influenza a viruses have an adverse impact on human and animal health worldwide through seasonal epidemics, newly emerging pandemics, and reoccurring outbreaks in livestock. the most severe human pandemic in  <dig> resulted in about  <dig> million fatal casualties  <cit> . in addition, seasonal influenza infections represent a major health hazard causing deaths and enormous losses of work force every year  <cit> .

we and others have shown in animal models that the genetic background of the host strongly influences mortality and morbidity after influenza infections. in particular, major differences in susceptibility and resistance were observed between different mouse inbred strains . detailed analysis of the mouse strains c57bl/6j and dba/2j revealed that c57bl/6j mice survived infections with a low pathogenic a/puerto rico/8/ <dig> h1n <dig> virus  whereas dba/2j mice rapidly lost weight and all infected mice died  <cit> . infected dba/2j had higher viral loads in their lungs and also exhibited a stronger inflammatory response compared to c57bl/6j mice  <cit> . therefore, the comparison of these two mouse strains represents a very suitable model system to identify genes that are associated with severe infection outcomes in humans  <cit> .

during an acute influenza virus infection, highly dynamic and inter-related responses are triggered in the host which eventually results in clearance of the pathogen and establishment of a long-lasting immunity. we recently demonstrated that these host responses can be studied comprehensively by measuring changes in the gene expression levels after infection  <cit> .

here, we expanded those earlier studies by utilizing a dual rnaseq approach that enabled us to investigate both virus as well as host gene expression in the same individual. we found several new host genes that are strongly correlated with virus gene expression. host genes potentially involved in viral replication were identified by comparisons with candidates from previous sirna studies. in addition, we identified host genes that exhibit differential expression between the c57bl/6j and dba/2j mouse strains after infection. these genes may be crucial to direct the host response to influenza a infections and be causal for differences in susceptibility and resistance of genetically diverse hosts to influenza or other viral infections. we studied the role of two candidate genes and found that deletion irf <dig> renders the host highly susceptible to h1n <dig> infection.

RESULTS
global expression profiles are distinct in c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice
rna was extracted from the lungs of c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice infected with pr8m  as described in  <cit> , and gene expression was quantified using rna sequencing  technology. principal component analysis  of normalized counts for host genes confirmed separate groupings of non-infected  and infected lungs . the transcriptome profiles of c57bl/6j mice and dba/2j mice were distinct as shown by the second principle component, whereas the host response to the infection is mostly represented by the first principle component which explains 59 % of the expression variation. pc <dig> reveals distinct expression profiles for the two strains due to their different genetic backgrounds explaining 18 % of the expression variation. c57bl/6j mice exhibited a change in transcriptome profiles that was distinct for days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> after infection. however, infected dba/2j mice showed an early and stronger change in transcriptome profiles at day  <dig> post infection  compared to c57bl/6j. their expression profile did not show any major changes until day  <dig> when dba/2j mice were moribund.fig.  <dig> pca analysis of normalized host gene counts for all samples. principle component analysis reveals separate grouping of non-infected mice and infected mice for both mouse strains. replicates for a given day p.i. grouped together well. for c57bl/6j mice, groups from different days p.i. were well separated. for dba/2j a much stronger infection response was observed compared to c57bl/6j mice and individual mice at days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. were not well separated. note that for day  <dig> p.i., two of three samples were not separated and only two spots are visible. b6md <dig>  d2md <dig> and b6md <dig>  d2md3: c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice mock-treated and analyzed at days  <dig> or  <dig> post treatment, respectively. sample labels: c57bl/6j at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> p.i.: b6d <dig>  b6d <dig>  b6d <dig>  b6d <dig>  b6d <dig>  respectively; and dba/2j mice at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> p.i.: d2d <dig>  d2d <dig>  d2d <dig>  respectively



expression levels of influenza gene segments correlate with viral load
in addition to expression profiling of host genes, rnaseq also allowed us to investigate transcripts of the eight viral segments. expression levels of all influenza segments  changed in all infected mice over time and were highest at days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. in c57bl/6j mice and at day  <dig> p.i. in dba/2j mice . in infected c57bl/6j mice, expression signals from influenza genes strongly decreased on day  <dig> p.i. and were at baseline levels of mock-treated controls on day  <dig> p.i. expression levels of influenza transcripts were higher in dba/2j mice compared to c57bl/6j mice at days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. most influenza rna segments revealed a similar relative increase in expression, except for the segment encoding the neuraminidase  showing a lower increase compared to all other segments.fig.  <dig> expression levels of influenza genes. normalized expression levels for influenza segments  were calculated as mean expression values , relative to respective mock treated animals . lines represent expression levels from lungs of c57bl/6j at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> p.i.  and at day  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> p.i. for dba/2j mice . b6mock, d2mock: mock-treated c57bl/6j and dba/2j control mice, respectively

differentially expressed genes overlap with genes previously identified to be required for viral replication
differentially expressed genes  between infected and mock-treated animals  were determined for c57bl/6j infected mice at days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> p.i and for dba/2j infected mice at days  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. . we then compared these degs with genes that were identified previously in sirna screens to be important for viral replication  <cit> . the comparison with a gene list  described by stertz et al.  <cit>  showed little overlap to our deg gene lists . however, another study  <cit>  used a combination of sirna experiments and gene expression studies and identified  <dig> genes. here, we found an overlap of  <dig> genes with degs from c57bl/6j and  <dig> with degs from dba/2j . eighteen genes were common to both c57bl/6j and dba/2j .table  <dig> deg genes

from these  <dig> genes that overlapped with degs from dba/2j, we selected irf <dig>  for further studies. we generated an irf <dig> knock-out line on a c57bl/6j background by backcrossing to test the importance of irf <dig> for the host response to influenza infection. after infection with 2x <dig> focus forming unit  pr8m virus, irf7−/− mice lost significantly more body weight and exhibited increased mortality compared to wild type controls . these observations demonstrate that irf <dig> plays an important role for the host defense to influenza a infection.fig.  <dig> body weight loss of irf <dig> and reg3g knock-out mice after influenza a infection. female mice were infected with 2x <dig> ffu pr8m by intranasal application. mice with a weight loss of more than 30 % of the starting weight had to be euthanized and were recorded as dead. a homozygous irf7
−/− mice showed higher body weight loss  and  significantly increased mortality  compared to c57bl/6j control mice. c mutant reg3g
−/− mice exhibited significant differences in body weight loss at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> p.i.  but no significant increase in mortality . please note that in  after day  <dig> p.i. only the surviving mice are shown and are thus not representative for the entire group



host genes involved in virus defense and innate immune responses strongly correlate with changes in influenza gene expression
we selected significantly up- or down-regulated genes  from c57bl/6j infected mice at days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> p.i. to identify host genes correlating with the expression of the viral genome. this analysis was restricted to c57bl/6j because we aimed to cover the period of increase in viral load until day  <dig> p.i. as well as the clearance phase after day  <dig> p.i. we found  <dig> host genes with a highly correlated expression   . gene ontology  enrichment analyses of positively correlated genes revealed enrichment for terms including ‘host immune response’, ‘regulation of virus genome replication’, ‘chemokine and cytokine production’ and ‘responses to virus’. reactome pathway analysis of these  <dig> positively correlated genes revealed enrichment for terms including ‘interferon signaling’, ‘immune system’, and ‘cytokine signaling in immune system’.table  <dig> host genes for which gene expression levels were highly correlated with influenza gene expression changes in infected c57bl/6j mice

several genes are up-regulated in c57bl/6j mice but not in dba/2j mice after infection
c57bl/6j mice exhibit a much lower viral load in their lungs after infection with h1n <dig> influenza a virus  compared to dba/2j mice  <cit> . furthermore, the host response in dba/2j is characterized by a stronger inflammatory response  <cit> . therefore, we searched for genes that were exclusively up-regulated in c57bl/6j but not in dba/2j mice after infection with pr8m. we hypothesized that these genes may be responsible for the more efficient control of virus replication in c57bl/6j mice. in a first step, we performed an analysis of variance  for all genes in all groups to identify genes that were significantly up-regulated . from this set, genes up-regulated only in c57bl/6j were selected. this filtering identified five degs that were significantly regulated at day  <dig> and  <dig> p.i. in c57bl/6j mice: lhx <dig>  2210415f13rik, trim <dig>  reg3g, and cd <dig>  the very low expression levels of lhx <dig>  2210415f13rik and trim <dig> make it unlikely that these are crucial candidates mediating the difference in susceptibility between c57bl/6j and dba/2j. we therefore investigated reg3g  in more detail.

knock-out mice carrying a mutation in the reg3g gene on a c57bl/6 n background were infected with influenza pr8m. differences in body weight loss were observed in mutant compared to wild type mice at day  <dig> to  <dig> p.i . however, no significant difference in survival was observed between reg3g knock-out and wild type c57bl/6 n mice after influenza a virus infection. thus, reg3g seems to play a minor role in the host defense to influenza virus h1n <dig> infection.

discussion
here, we performed rnaseq based analysis of gene expression changes in a murine influenza a infection model by comparing a resistant mouse strain, c57bl/6j, that survives pr8m  infection, with a highly susceptible strain, dba/2j, for which infection with pr8m is lethal. our studies confirm differences in gene expression profiles between the two mouse strains that were described in a previous analysis using microarrays  <cit> . at day  <dig> p.i.,  <dig> differentially expressed probesets in infected c57bl/6j and  <dig> in infected dba/2j mice, respectively, were identified previously by alberts and colleagues  <cit>  and also overlapped with degs found in this study.

influenza virus transcripts carry a poly tail similar to host mrnas. cellular mrnas are polyadenylated through cleavage at the polyadenylation signal and subsequent addition of the poly tail. in contrast, viral mrnas obtain their polyadenylation through a stuttering mechanism in which the rna-dependent rna polymerase moves back and forth over a stretch of five to seven u residues shortly before the 5´end  <cit> . since we selected poly rnas for rnaseq, we were able to investigate expression of viral genes and, at the same time, to correlate changes in the host transcriptome with increase and decrease of virus gene expression. in this way, we could confirm that changes in expression levels of viral mrna were correlated with viral load in the infected lungs. the kinetics of viral replication over time as well as the difference between c57bl/6j and dba/2j was well reflected by changes in sequence counts determined by rnaseq. thus, the relative changes in rna expression may serve as a surrogate for virus replication and viral load in infected animals. thus, rnaseq represents a big advantage compared to microarrays technology where a parallel detection of host gene expression and viral genome expression is not possible.

zhou et al.  <cit>  combined an sirna screen with expression analysis in the human lung epithelial cell line a <dig> after infection with pr <dig> virus. they identified  <dig> genes as significantly up-regulated and subsequently performed a sirna screen for those genes. that screen detected  <dig> genes as regulators of viral replication, including  <dig> genes that were not reported previously. we found  <dig> genes that overlapped with the  <dig> genes identified by  <cit>  .

from the  <dig> overlapping genes, six genes  were also identified as host factors involved in influenza virus replication by shapira and colleagues  <cit> . they used human bronchial epithelial cells for transcriptional profiling and combined the data with results from a yeast two-hybrid approach where ten major viral proteins of pr <dig> were tested against  <dig>  human proteins.

furthermore, genes acting downstream of rig-i binding to viral rna like irf <dig>  irf <dig>  stat <dig> and nf-kb were also found amongst the genes that overlapped with the list from zhou et al.  <cit> . amongst these factors, irf <dig> has been described as an essential key mediator of interferon signaling activation and regulation and has been shown to be critical for innate immunity  <cit> . it is constitutively expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells which rapidly produce type i ifn in response to viral infection  <cit> . this initial activation triggers a positive feedback loop regulation of ifnα and ifnβ genes by irf <dig> in adjacent cells  <cit> . the importance of irf <dig> in influenza pathogenesis was also shown in several in vitro studies  <cit> . epithelial cells recognize influenza a virus via rig-i/mavs, leading to the activation of irf <dig> and subsequent induction of type i and type iii interferons in redundant amplification loops. in addition, a recently published study revealed an irf7-dependent amplification of ifns in an influenza patient carrying a mutation in that gene  <cit> . in contrast, no in vivo studies using irf <dig> deficient mouse mutants have been published so far. therefore, we selected irf <dig>  to generate knock-out mice on a c57bl/6j background by backcrossing and to investigate its role for host defense in vivo. after infection with pr8m, irf7-deficient mice exhibited a more pronounced body weight loss and increased mortality compared to wild type mice after infection with h1n <dig> virus. these experiments demonstrate the in vivo relevance of irf <dig> for the host response to influenza virus infection. our studies confirm the potential role of irf <dig> in influenza pathogenesis in an in vivo model system as suggested by previous in vitro studies  <cit> . the potential functional roles of all other genes from the list in table  <dig> are discussed in more detail in the supplements.

when comparing results from several rnai screens , stertz and shaw identified  <dig> genes with potential importance for viral replication that were found in at least two screens . however, only seven genes overlapped with the  <dig> genes in dba/2j at day  <dig> p.i. . one explanation for the small overlap may be that the rnai screens were performed in cell culture whereas our studies identified differentially regulated genes in infected lungs. it should be noted that transcriptomes in lungs are much more complex due to the contribution from infiltrating immune cells. thus, changes in expression of cultured cells may not reflect the entire spectrum of host responses well. more future studies will be necessary to further elucidate this aspect.

since viral and host transcripts can be followed in the same individual, we were able to correlate changes in host gene expression with changes in the level of virus gene expression. we studied host gene expression in c57bl/6j lungs and viral transcripts including both the period of increasing viral load  as well as the period of decrease in viral load . we found  <dig> host genes that were positively or negatively correlated with influenza gene expression in infected c57bl/6j mice . many of these genes exhibit well known functions in the host immune response which are discussed in more detail in the additional file 2: supplemental material.

in contrast to c57bl/6j mice that survive, dba/2j mice die on day six to seven after infection with pr <dig>  a comparison of the degs in both mouse strains was performed to identify genes that are exclusively up-regulated in c57bl/6j. we hypothesize that these genes are candidates mediating the resistance of c57bl/6j against influenza infection. we identified two genes  that were significantly and strongly up-regulated in c57bl/6j mice compared to dba/2j. the b cell co-receptor cd <dig> is an important receptor regulating b cell activation  <cit> , negatively regulating bcr signaling  <cit>  and is additionally expressed on murine nk cells where it acts in an inhibitory manner through regulating cytokine production but not cytotoxicity  <cit> . in c57bl/6j we observed a two-fold higher up-regulation of cd <dig> compared to dba/2j. the resulting deficit in the inhibitory effect on nk cells and the following diminished regulation of cytokine amounts may be a good explanation for the exaggerated immune response observed in dba/2j mice. more experiments will be needed to evaluate the possible role of cd <dig> for the host response to influenza a virus.

for reg3g an increase in expression levels was observed in ibd , a murine bacterial reconstitution model  <cit>  and after experimental intestinal infection with listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . the role of reg3g in lung infection was further elucidated by choi et al.  <cit> . they were able to show that reg3g expression is regulated by stat <dig> and highly increased after mrsa  infection in the lung epithelium. administration of recombinant reg3g was able to restore mucosal immunity against mrsa in vivo, highlighting the therapeutic potential for reg3g  <cit> . the fact that reg3g was up-regulated in c57bl/6j, but not in dba/2j may account for the differences in disease outcome. we therefore studied the possible role of reg3g in knock-out mice. however, despite its strong up-regulation after influenza virus infection, deletion of this gene had no strong effect on the susceptibility of the host to infections with h1n <dig>  it may, however, be possible that reg3g deficient mice are susceptible to other influenza virus subtypes or other viral infections.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, using rnaseq analysis we identified novel genes important for viral replication or host defense. this study adds further important knowledge to host-pathogen-interactions and suggests additional candidates that are crucial for host susceptibility or survival during influenza a infections.
