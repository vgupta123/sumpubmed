BACKGROUND
once a free-living α-proteobacterium, the mitochondrion has experienced numerous gene losses over time as part of its endosymbiotic lifestyle, leading to a greatly reduced number and diversity of genes  <cit> . although functional translocation of coding sequences from the mitochondrion to the nucleus has essentially ceased in animal mitochondria, these seemingly difficult events occur at surprisingly high frequency in flowering plants. greatly extending findings from past studies focusing on single genes in a limited group of angiosperms , adams et al.  <cit>  surveyed  <dig> diverse angiosperms by southern blot hybridization and found that all  <dig> ribosomal protein genes and both sdh genes had been frequently lost from the mitochondrial genome and, most likely, functionally transferred to the nucleus, whereas only two putative losses were detected among the other  <dig> genes, most of which encode respiratory proteins. these differences in frequency of functional transfer to the nucleus  are probably largely due to relative ease of protein import back into the mitochondrion  <cit> .

one of the most well-studied and interesting of the frequently transferred ribosomal protein genes is rps <dig>  which was estimated to have been lost from the mitochondrial genome  <dig> times separately among the  <dig> angiosperms surveyed by adams et al.  <cit> . mitochondrial genome sequencing has confirmed two of these inferred losses, in zea  <cit>   and in beta  <cit> , but not a third, in nicotiana, where a pseudogene copy comprising most of rps <dig> is instead present in the mitochondrial genome  <cit>  . rps <dig> is also found only as a pseudogene in the mitochondrial genome in arabidopsis  <cit> , potato  <cit> , prunus  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , rice  <cit> , and wheat  <cit> . so far, an intact and potentially functional mitochondrial copy of rps <dig> has been identified by sequencing in relatively few plants, namely, oenothera  <cit> , brassica  <cit> , pea  <cit> , and broad bean  <cit> .

transferred, functional copies of rps <dig> have been well characterized from the nuclear genomes of arabidopsis  <cit>  and three grasses , while a less well- characterized but likely functional and transferred rps <dig> gene is represented in est collections of tomato. the nuclear rps <dig> genes of rice, maize, and wheat unquestionably result from the same transfer event, as they share a highly derived and fascinating structure acquired post-transfer and described below. in contrast, the different structures of nuclear rps <dig>  in arabidopsis and tomato relative to one another and the grasses indicate that they are probably each the product of evolutionarily independent transfer events.

the nuclear rps <dig> genes of the three grasses are located within the intron of an anciently transferred nuclear gene that encodes mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> . alternate splicing of the sdh2-rps <dig> primary transcript results in two different products, a conventional sdh <dig> mrna containing both sdh <dig> exons and a chimeric mrna containing the first exon of sdh <dig> and rps <dig>  <cit> . the products of both mrnas are thought to be targeted to the mitochondrion using the n-terminal, cleavable extension of sdh <dig>  followed by proteolytic processing of the sdh2-rps <dig> fusion precursor to generate mature rps <dig>  <cit> .

the mitochondrion-to-nucleus transfer of rps <dig> in grasses must have occurred at least  <dig> million years ago, i.e., in the last common ancestor of rice, maize, and wheat. it is therefore striking that nearly intact – and expressed – copies of this gene are still present in the mitochondrial genomes of two of these plants, rice  <cit>  and wheat  <cit>  . to further explore this situation, including determining exactly when the grass rps <dig> transfer occurred and whether other transfers of this gene have occurred in related plants, we have examined the structure and expression of rps <dig> from a large number of grasses and other members of the poales. our results show that the grass transfer occurred roughly  <dig> million years ago, in the common ancestor of all grasses, and is accompanied by widespread, persistent retention of expressed and nearly intact pseudogenes among many diverse grass lineages. we also report two new, apparent cases of rps <dig> transfer in poales, one relatively ancient and the other more recent, both of which are also accompanied by retention of expressed mitochondrial pseudogenes.

RESULTS
slot-blot survey for presence/absence of rps <dig> in mtdna
we conducted dna slot blot hybridizations to survey for the presence/absence of rps <dig> in the mitochondrial genomes of  <dig> poales taxa . as a positive control, the membranes were first probed for mitochondrial cox <dig>  a gene found universally in mitochondrial genomes of all examined eukaryotes, including the  <dig> angiosperms surveyed by adams et al.  <cit> . as expected, the cox <dig> probe hybridized well to all poales dnas tested. the membranes were then stripped and re-hybridized with a mitochondrial rps <dig> gene probe from oryza. this resulted in strong hybridization, roughly proportional from slot to slot compared to the cox <dig> control, to all poales taxa surveyed with the exceptions of pennisetum and zea . these slot blot results are consistent with published southern blot data for eight of these same poales taxa  relative to the other poales examined . therefore, it would appear that rps <dig> has been lost from the mitochondrial genome just once among the poales examined, in the common ancestor of the panicoideae.

we attribute the weak rps <dig> signal in the pennisetum and zea slots to either non-specific background noise in the slot or to hybridization to the transferred nuclear copy of the gene, which exists at low copy number compared to the mitochondrial genome . hordeum also showed reduced hybridization strength with rps <dig> , suggesting that much or all of its gene might have been lost from the mitochondrial genome. however, as described below, we succeeded in isolating by pcr a nearly full-length copy of rps <dig> from hordeum with undiverged sequences typical of mitochondrial rps <dig> and, more importantly, we isolated hordeum rps <dig> cdna sequences that were identical to the pcr sequence except for six sites of mitochondrial-diagnostic rna editing. therefore, we are confident that hordeum mtdna does contain rps <dig>  we attribute its reduced slot blot hybridization to, most likely, slot-specific dna shedding after the initial cox <dig> hybridization. alternatively, the reduced intensity of mitochondrial rps <dig> relative to cox <dig> in hordeum could be real, if the former gene were located only on a low-copy-number form of the genome , with cox <dig> present on a standard, high-copy-number genome conformation.

isolation and sequencing of mitochondrial rps <dig> genes and cdnas
both previously sequenced mitochondrial rps <dig> genes from grasses  are pseudogenes  <cit> . to determine whether the many other strongly hybridizing mitochondrial rps <dig> sequences from grasses are also pseudogenes, or whether some might be still intact and possibly functional, we used degenerate primers to pcr-amplify and then sequence rps <dig> genes from these and various other poales. no mitochondrial-like rps <dig> sequence was isolated from the two panicoid grasses examined by slot blots  or from the four other panicoids examined by pcr . this further supports the idea that the gene disappeared from the mitochondrial genome in the common ancestor of the panicoideae. in contrast, intact or nearly intact copies of mitochondrial-like rps <dig> were isolated from the other  <dig> poales taxa examined.

rps <dig> sequences were deemed to be of likely mitochondrial provenance if one or both of the following criteria were met: 1) they aligned well with the published mitochondrial rps <dig> sequences of oryza and triticum with limited divergence , and 2) they were determined to undergo mitochondrial-characteristic/diagnostic c→u and/or u→c rna editing. the latter provides strong evidence for mitochondrial provenance . rps <dig> cdna sequences are already available for oryza  <cit>  and triticum  <cit>  and were determined for  <dig> additional putative mitochondrial genes. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> showed evidence of mitochondrial-characteristic rna editing . the first criterion is premised on the fact that in virtually all plants, rates of nucleotide substitutions are much lower  for mitochondrial genes than for nuclear genes  <cit> . consistent with this, in all examined cases, plant mitochondrial genes transferred to the nucleus have accumulated much more sequence divergence than their homologs still present in the mitochondrion . although the pseudogene sequences from cyperus and scirpus were not checked for editing status and are relatively divergent  we nonetheless are able to assign them to the mitochondrial genome because of their close relationship  with a third pseudogene sequence from the cyperaceae, from carex, for which rna editing was demonstrated .

a no partial editing was observed; i.e., whenever a cdna clone had any edits, it had all the edits found in aggregate among all cdnas sequenced for that gene.

all  <dig> poaceae mitochondrial rps <dig> sequences isolated are pseudogenes sharing the same two frameshift deletions; these are both  <dig> nt in length and are only  <dig> nt apart . these two deletions are estimated to have occurred about  <dig> million years ago, in the last common ancestor of all grasses . of the nine non-grass poales examined, five  contain intact mitochondrial rps <dig> genes, whereas all three cyperaceae and the one joinvilleaceae examined possess pseudogenes of rps <dig> in their mitochondrial genomes . joinvillea contains a single frameshift, which is possibly shared with one of the two grass-wide 4-nt deletions , whereas there are between three and five frameshifts  in each cyperaceae mitochondrial gene .

isolation and sequencing of nuclear rps <dig> genes
we also wished to amplify any nuclear copies of rps <dig> present in the poales, but the much higher substitution rates and accumulated divergence in the nucleus combined with the much lower copy number of the nuclear genome made this more challenging than amplification of mitochondrial rps <dig>  nuclear copies of rps <dig> have already been reported from three grasses . after numerous attempts with repeated adjustments to thermocycling parameters and primer design, we were able to amplify putative nuclear copies of rps <dig> sequence from  <dig> additional poales . all of these putative nuclear rps <dig> genes have intact open reading frames, and in all cases, rps <dig> is either a pseudogene in the mitochondrial genome , as is also the case in oryza and triticum, or is entirely absent from the mitochondrial genome , as in zea. we infer  that an intact, functional copy of rps <dig> exists in those many grasses and two cyperaceae for which mitochondrial rps <dig> is a pseudogene and for which a second, putative nuclear copy was not isolated. in this respect, note that rps <dig> is an essential protein in the mitochondrial ribosome, at least in yeast where this issue has been examined  <cit> .

nuclear assignment of the newly isolated, intact rps <dig> genes from anomochloa, pariana, dendrocalamus, hordeum, pennisetum, and sorghum is straightforward. this is because all six sequences are highly divergent from mitochondrial rps <dig> genes and group with 100% bootstrap support with the previously characterized nuclear rps <dig> genes from oryza, zea, and triticum . moreover the branching order among these nine rps <dig> genes  is congruent with organismal phylogeny . finally, we determined  that three of the six newly characterized genes  have both homologous n-terminal targeting sequences and the same nuclear genomic location  as previously shown for nuclear rps <dig> of oryza, zea, and triticum  <cit> . we therefore conclude that the functional transfer of rps <dig> from the mitochondrial genome into the nuclear sdh <dig> intron occurred in a common ancestor of all grasses.

unlike the grass situation, assignment of the second, intact copy of rps <dig> from carex as nuclear in location was not possible based on differential sequence divergence. this is because this sequence is not significantly more divergent  than the pseudogene copy of rps <dig> that is assigned to the mitochondrial genome based on its rna editing status . in fact both genes from carex are relatively divergent compared to most mitochondrial rps <dig> genes and pseudogenes . southern blot hybridization was performed to assess whether one or both copies of rps <dig> are present in carex mtdna. a nearly full-length  rps <dig> gene segment from oryza mtdna was used as the probe, as this sequence is roughly equally divergent from both carex genes. the oryza gene hybridized to only a single band in all four single digests of carex total dna . double digestion with each of the same four enzymes plus hind iii gave the pattern expected for a mitochondrial location of the rps <dig> pseudogene that was already assigned to the mitochondrial genome based on its rna editing status. that is, hind iii doesn't cut the putative nuclear rps <dig> gene of carex, but does cut the mitochondrial gene  <dig> nt from its 5' end, and the double digests consistently produced two bands of the relative intensities expected given the location of this hind iii site . there is a formal possibility that the second, putatively nuclear rps <dig> gene of carex is located instead in the mitochondrial genome, immediately downstream of the mitochondrial pseudogene, i.e., within the roughly  <dig> bp region of the ca.  <dig> bp hind iii double digestion product of figure  <dig> that contains the bulk of the pseudogene. however, such proximal duplications have not been seen in plant mtdnas; instead these very large and mostly noncoding genomes rearrange at very high rates, and duplicates are relatively far apart from each other  <cit> .

a second important line of evidence consistent with a nuclear location of the intact rps <dig> gene of carex is that its reading frame is extended significantly at its 5' end, by at least  <dig> codons. such extensions are uncommon in mitochondrial-resident genes, but are typical of mitochondrial genes transferred to the nucleus  <cit> , where they commonly serve as cleavable targeting sequences that direct import into the mitochondrion . it seems particularly unlikely that an essentially adjacent duplication of rps <dig> within the mitochondrial genome would have occurred in such a manner as to create a perfect duplication of the normal-length rps <dig> coding sequence without any trace of rpl <dig>  which in virtually all angiosperms is separated by only  <dig> nt from the 5' end of rps <dig> .

overall, therefore, these two lines of evidence strongly suggest that the intact rps <dig> gene of carex is not located in the same genome as the carex mitochondrial pseudogene. because mitochondrial sequences have never been found transferred to plant chloroplast genomes, but are frequently transferred to the nucleus  <cit> , and because chloroplast dna is invariably present in higher copy than mtdna, a chloroplast location of the intact carex rps <dig> gene can be ruled out. by default, therefore, this gene is almost certainly present in the nuclear genome.

the second, intact copy of rps <dig> from joinvillea is also not notably more divergent than its rna-edited – and thus indisputably mitochondrial – pseudogene copy , although in this case neither gene is particular divergent. a similar southern blot analysis  as for carex also reveals that the mitochondrial pseudogene of joinvillea is present in much higher copy number than the intact copy of rps <dig> . two of the double-digests also localize the predominant mitochondrial rps <dig> hybridization signal in joinvillea to a small fragment of about  <dig> kb, again reducing the possibility of intragenomic rps <dig> duplication to immediately adjacent duplication. despite considerable effort , we did not succeed in obtaining sequence upstream of the normal rps <dig> start codon for the intact rps <dig> gene of joinvillea, and in this sense, therefore, the case for its nuclear location is weaker than for carex. nonetheless, we think it likely based on the southern blot results that this gene is in the nucleus. at the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility that the putatively nuclear copy of rps <dig> is in fact located in the mitochondrial genome, but present only on a "sublimon" form of the genome of sufficiently low copy number relative to the principal genome conformer as to be undetectable at the sensitivity level of the southern blots shown in figure  <dig> 

number of rps <dig> transfers and evolution of transferred rps <dig> genes
although we have not shown that the putatively nuclear rps <dig> genes of carex and joinvillea are expressed, much less that their products are targeted to the mitochondrion, what seems relatively clear  is that in both plants the mitochondrial genome contains only a single, pseudogene copy of rps <dig>  therefore, the functional copy of rps <dig> almost certainly resides in the nucleus in carex and joinvillea, and since these are the only intact genes isolated via pcr, they are the best candidates for being the functional, transferred copy of rps <dig>  that the carex nuclear gene has an intact open reading frame in the face of substantial sequence divergence  strongly supports it being under selection and therefore functional, as does the fact that its estimated ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution  is substantially lower  than  <dig> . nuclear rps <dig> of joinvillea displays relatively little divergence , and therefore its intactness is not very compelling evidence for it being functional. strong evidence, however, comes from its dn/ds ratio, of  <dig> .

accepting that the intact rps <dig> genes of carex and joinvillea do indeed represent cases of functional transfer to the nucleus, then we can ask whether they and the set of transferred genes in grasses result from a single common transfer, or from two or three independent transfers. taken together, four lines of evidence, none individually strong, lead us to conclude that these three sets of transferred genes are probably the product of three separate transfer events. first, the three nuclear gene sets do not group together in phylogenetic analysis , as would be expected if they were the product of a single common transfer. at the same time, we must acknowledge that the separation of the three nuclear gene sets is not robust, and that none of the three attaches specifically to its cognate mitochondrial gene clade, as expected under the hypothesis of three separate transfers, specifically in the last common ancestors of the grasses, the joinvilleaceae, and the cyperaceae. on the other hand, given the very strong grouping of the entire clade of transferred genes of grasses , and that joinvillea is the closely related sister group of grasses , its failure to group with the grass genes  suggests separate transfers.

second, and related to this last point, the nuclear rps <dig> of joinvillea is not very divergent in general and is far less divergent than the nuclear genes of grasses . nuclear substitution rates do not appear to be unusually low in joinvillea  <cit> , and therefore this result suggests more recent – and thus independent – transfer of rps <dig> in joinvillea compared to grasses.

third, and here we have data relevant only to the carex and grass sets of nuclear genes , the 5' extension  of the carex nuclear gene is not evidently homologous to those of grasses, which are well conserved among themselves . possession of different n-terminal extensions has generally been regarded as good evidence for independency of transfer .

finally, using nine sets of primers designed to rps <dig> and the first exon of sdh <dig>  we failed to recover any pcr products from carex and joinvillea indicative of rps <dig> insertion into the sdh <dig> intron under conditions in which all three grasses examined  yielded an sdh2-rps <dig> product. this result is consistent with the hypothesis that rps <dig> is in a different location in the carex and joinvillea nuclear genomes than in the grasses and is therefore the product of separate transfers. an important positive control on these negative sdh2-rps <dig> amplifications from carex and joinvillea is that the same sdh <dig> and rps <dig> primers did work for each plant in gene-specific contexts. that is, the  rps <dig> primers did recover the putatively nuclear carex and joinvillea rps <dig> genes when used in combination with 5' rps <dig> primers, and the sdh1-exon  <dig> primers did work in concert with primers to sdh2-exon  <dig>  unfortunately, however, we did not sequence the sdh <dig> pcr products from carex and joinvillea to rule out the possibility, albeit remote, that they contain a transferred rps <dig> gene that is, for reasons unclear, refractory to sdh2-rps14-based pcr isolation .

although three of the above four lines of evidence are consistent with the joinvillea and grass genes being the product of separate transfers , there is one, ambiguous piece of evidence that, upon one possible interpretation, supports the genes being derived from the same transfer event. this involves the ambiguously aligned  <dig> nt at positions 89– <dig> . according to the "best" alignment, as shown in the figure, mitochondrial rps <dig> genes of joinvillea and grasses contain different deletions in this region, each of  <dig> nt in length and overlapping by  <dig> nt. according to this alignment, therefore, the joinvillea and grass genes were pseudogenized independently of one another. alternatively, by sliding either  <dig> nt gap by  <dig> nt, and therefore at the cost of postulating an additional nt substitution in one lineage or the other, one obtains an alignment in which the grasses and joinvillea share a  <dig> nt deletion. this, then, would constitute evidence that their pseudogenes are the product of a common pseudogenization event. if so, this would also be consistent with the hypothesis that their nuclear genes result from a common transfer event. overall, then, the case for separate transfer in joinvillea is weaker than for carex . on balance, however, we believe the evidence – in particular based on highly differential degrees of nuclear gene divergence  and failure to isolate a grass-like sdh2-rps <dig> gene under positively controlled circumstances – favors a separate putative transfer in joinvillea as well.

discussion
multiple transfers of rps <dig> to the nucleus in poales
we have described three, most likely independent cases of functional transfer of rps <dig> from the mitochondrion to the nucleus during the evolution of the poales. the transfer in the grass family poaceae had already been described for the three cereals of greatest agronomic import, oryza , zea , and triticum   <cit> . our results indicate that this transfer most likely occurred in the stem lineage leading to all extant grasses , roughly  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . this conclusion follows from three observations: 1) the previously unexamined basal lineages of grasses  contain a pseudogene copy of rps <dig> in the mitochondrial genome that shares two frameshift mutations with all other grasses. 2) anomochloa contains the same chimeric, sdh2/rps <dig> nuclear gene structure as previously described in oryza, zea, and triticum. 3) joinvillea, which is only one node removed from being the sister group to poaceae  appears to share with grasses neither the two mitochondrial rps <dig> frameshifts  nor the nuclear sdh2/rps <dig> gene structure.

the second transfer, apparently  shared by all three, diverse members of the cyperaceae examined, is also roughly  <dig> million years old  <cit> , and possibly older if shared by juncaceae and even more distantly related poales . the third putative transfer, which is the least well supported overall and in terms of being independent , is unique to the single examined species of joinvillea  and appears to be rather recent as judged by the relatively undiverged nature of the joinvillea nuclear rps <dig> gene . indeed, based on nuclear divergence levels, this is the most recent case of functional mitochondrial-to-nucleus gene transfer yet described . a fourth case of rps <dig> functional transfer in poales is likely represented by lachnocaulon. southern blot hybridization indicated that rps <dig> is probably missing from lachnocaulon mtdna  <cit> , however, material of lachnocaulon was not available for this study.

although the cyperaceae was included in the adams et al.  <cit>  survey for mitochondrial gene loss and potential nuclear transfer, its rps <dig> transfer was not inferred because the mitochondrion genome of cyperaceae contains an essentially full-length pseudogene of rps <dig> . the rps <dig> transfer in joinvillea, which was not included among the  <dig> angiosperms surveyed by adams et al.  <cit> , would have been missed for the same reason. these observations underscore the potential, as discussed by adams et al.  <cit> , for undiagnosed pseudogenes to lead to underestimates of mitochondrial gene "loss" and potential transfer in such southern blot surveys. as noted in background, rps <dig> pseudogenes have also been described in four disparate eudicots  <cit> . considering all this, and that  <dig> phylogenetically separate losses of mitochondrial rps <dig> were inferred by adams et al.  <cit> , it is possible that this gene has actually been transferred to the nucleus many more times than this among the  <dig> angiosperms examined in that study. on the other hand, as adams et al.  <cit>  point out, gene loss patterns can also lead to overestimates of the number of gene transfer events, i.e., when phylogenetically separate losses as inferred from blots trace back to a single deeper loss of mitochondrial gene function – and probably nuclear gene transfer – with one or more taxa within the group in question having a largely intact pseudogene scored as present.

as noted in background, two of the  <dig> losses of mitochondrial rps <dig> inferred by adams et al.  <cit>  have been confirmed by complete genome sequencing  <cit> , but a third was misdiagnosed, as nicotiana mtdna actually contains a pseudogene copy comprising most of rps <dig>  an additional southern blot hybridization  has revealed that rps <dig> is indeed present in mtdna of the same nicotiana sample examined by adams et al.  <cit> . further inspection of the autoradiogram from which mitochondrial rps <dig> absence was originally and erroneously inferred suggests that this error was caused by poor southern-blot transfer in the region of the nicotiana lane where the rps <dig> band should have appeared. we emphasize, however, that the overall accuracy of the southern blot estimates by adams et al.  <cit>  of mitochondrial gene/presence is very high as assessed by comparison with the definitive results obtained by mitochondrial genome sequencing. six of the  <dig> genomes surveyed by adams et al.  <cit>  have now been sequenced  <cit> . these genome sequences confirm all  <dig> mitochondrial protein gene presences inferred for these six genomes by adams et al.  <cit> , as well as  <dig> of  <dig> gene absences.  the second erroneously inferred gene absence was a misdiagnosis by adams et al.  <cit>  of rps <dig> as absent from mtdna of nicotiana , when in fact the nicotiana mitochondrial genome sequence shows rps <dig> to be present and intact  <cit> . this reflects a data-entry error in figure  <dig> of adams et al.  <cit> , as our notebooks show that rps <dig> was correctly scored based on southern blots as present in all three solanaceae mtdnas.

prolonged retention, transcription, and editing of rps <dig> pseudogenes
fully  <dig> of the  <dig> diverse genera examined from the three gene-transfer families  have retained essentially full-length rps <dig> pseudogenes in the mitochondrial genome, with the six exceptions representing but a single case of relatively recent loss of mitochondrial rps <dig> in the grass subfamily panicoideae . in the case of the poaceae and cyperaceae, which represent  <dig> of the  <dig> described pseudogenes, this retention is despite the antiquity of the functional transfers to the nucleus and the evident  pseudogenizations of mitochondrial rps <dig>  the latter occurring roughly  <dig> million years ago in both families. equally if not more remarkably, all  <dig> mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogenes examined  are transcribed, and  <dig> of the  <dig> are subject to rna editing .

such long-term, nearly pervasive survival of transcribed  pseudogenes is to our knowledge unparalleled. what could account for this, as well as the presence of virtually intact mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogenes in a number of eudicots  <cit> , including long-lived and pervasively retained pseudogenes in the solanaceae ? first, we could be wrong in calling these pseudogenes. perhaps rps <dig> is subject to some form of programmed translational recoding  to produce functional mrna and protein from these apparent pseudogenes. although programmed recoding is quite rare overall, it has been reported for a number of genes and organisms  <cit> , and should not be entirely dismissed as a possibility here. sequencing of mitochondrial rps <dig> proteins and investigation of potential ribosomal association of mitochondrial rps <dig> transcripts  could be pursued to test this possibility, unlikely as it may seem .

second, the low rate of loss and decay of mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogenes may, at least in part, simply reflect generally low mutation rates in plant mitochondrial genomes. it is well known that, with rare exception  <cit> , synonymous substitution rates are extremely low in plant mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . comparable data on neutral rates of both short indels  and long indels  are lacking for plant mtdnas. however, if the positive correlation observed in other genomes  between rates of substitutions and rates of indels holds true for plant mitochondrial genomes, then this may explain part of the rps <dig> pseudogene paradox. indeed, the alignments shown in additional file  <dig>  suggest that rates of both substitutions and short indels are elevated in the cyperaceae. however, whether large deletions leading to gene loss are also elevated in cyperaceae  remains to be seen. a very different picture is seen for the only other gene transfer case  for which extensive sampling of mitochondrial gene/presence and gene sequence has been carried out within the transfer clade. there, a largely all-or-nothing pattern is seen; among  <dig> legume genera belonging to the gene transfer clade, only a single mitochondrial pseudogene was found, compared to three independent cases of cox <dig> gene loss and several lineages in which an intact and probably functional mitochondrial cox <dig> gene was found  <cit> .

third, independent of its protein-coding function, there may be other functional elements within or in close proximity to rps <dig> that make it difficult or impossible to delete  even when it is a pseudogene. most angiosperm mitochondrial genes  occur as a single genic island in a large sea of intergenic spacer dna  <cit> . however, rps <dig> is exceptional in that it is cotranscribed with  <cit>  and separated by only a single nt from rpl <dig> in virtually all angiosperms . by being so short  and so tightly linked to rpl <dig>  rps <dig> may be relatively buffered compared to most plant mitochondrial genes against large deletions that would lead to gene loss. another possibility is that sequences within rps <dig> or immediately downstream of it  are under selection to maintain proper expression of rpl <dig>  while these arguments may hold water for cyperaceae, for which rpl <dig> is intact and immediately upstream of rps <dig> , they are problematic for grasses. this is because rpl <dig> has been functionally transferred to the nucleus in most grasses , and despite its multiple, within-grass transfers being more recent than the grass-wide rps <dig> transfer and pseudogenization, there have been fully five independent losses of mitochondrial rpl <dig> among the same  <dig> grasses examined in this study , while some  other grasses contain rpl <dig> pseudogenes in the mitochondrion. the pervasive and prolonged  retention of mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogenes in grasses and cyperaceae also contrasts with the numerous  phylogenetically separate losses of mitochondrial rps <dig> across the broad sweep of angiosperm phylogeny  <cit> .

overall, then we are left with a suspicion that rps <dig> may be unusually recalcitrant – even as a pseudogene – to elimination from mitochondrial genomes of poaceae and cyperaceae. the possibility that some portion of the rps <dig> sequence may play some entirely unrelated role that renders the pseudogene's deletion problematic must be considered, as must the possibility that it's not actually a pseudogene thanks to some form of programmed translational recoding. on the other hand, rps <dig> and rpl <dig> may simply lie near different ends of the expected frequency distribution of pseudogene deletion in such slowly evolving genomes as those of plant mitochondria .

the continued, presumably meaningless transcription of mitochondrial rps <dig>  in many grasses in which both mitochondrial genes are, apparently, defunct, is not unexpected given that plant mitochondrial promoters are very short  <cit>  and that rates of nucleotide substitutions and short indels are very low. these pseudo-transcripts continue to be edited at low levels comparable to those of intact and putatively functional mitochondrial rps <dig> genes . however, two observations suggest that this represents noisy/leaky editing that is not under selection. first, fully half of the edits are u→c edits, which are extremely rare in angiosperm mitochondrial genes . indeed, all of the 357– <dig> edits detected in the four angiosperms in which comprehensive analyses of rna editing have been carried out are c→u edits . second, many of the rps <dig> pseudogene edits  reduce the conservation of rps <dig> proteins , whereas 94% of nonsynonymous edits increase protein conservation across species  <cit> . note that transcribed and edited pseudogenes have also been described for several other mitochondrial genes in a diversity of angiosperms .

the peculiar evolutionary dynamics of plant mitochondrial genes and their expression leads to a conundrum with respect to using gene sequence and expression data to predict whether a given gene is likely to be functional or not. because transcribed and rna-edited pseudogenes are relatively common in plant mtdna, and because rates of gene decay/pseudogenization are relatively low , one can predict that an appreciable fraction of intact genes that are transcribed and rna-edited are nonetheless not functional. because many plant mitochondrial pseudogenes show evidence of relaxed constraints on editing , this may be a second important source of clues  that a gene is non-functional. indeed, the loss of editing at evolutionarily conserved positions has led to the suggestion that the intact rps <dig> gene of brassica  <cit>  and rps <dig> gene of oenothera  <cit>  are in fact cryptic pseudogenes. this issue is particularly relevant to those two classes of plant mitochondrial protein genes  that are very frequently lost from the mitochondrial genome and functionally transferred to the nucleus during angiosperm evolution  <cit> . many of the intact mitochondrial copies of these genes may turn out, upon further  analysis, to instead be cryptic pseudogenes.

indels in rps <dig> pseudogenes
three aspects of the pattern and apparent frequency of indels in the mitochondrial rps <dig> pseudogenes deserve comment. the first was noted above, that the cyperaceae pseudogenes have on average sustained more indels  than the equal-aged poaceae pseudogenes, and that this may reflect mechanistically-related, correlated increases in rates of nucleotide substitutions and small indels in the cyperaceae . second, there may be an elevated rate of indels in the ~ <dig> million year lineage leading to eragrostis. this lineage has accumulated four frameshifts, compared to no indels in about half of the grass pseudogenes  and only a single indel in most other grasses . unlike cyperaceae, eragrostis does not show an elevated substitution rate, and if this pattern holds with much more data , then this could be an apparently rare case of uncoupled rates of nucleotide substitutions and short indels.

finally, there are two sets of apparently homoplasiously derived indels . none of these involve short direct repeats, where replication slippage can readily produce such patterns of homoplasy. instead, because the same pattern extends across about  <dig> markers in the adjacent rpl <dig> gene, we believe that the second set  of indel homoplasies is the result of horizontal gene transfer from festuca to secale and danthonia. horizontal transfer could also explain the second set of homoplasies , but there is far less evidence for transfer in this case , and parallel deletion is a good alternative explanation. these and many additional cases of more or less well supported horizontal transfer of the rpl5/rps <dig> locus will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .

CONCLUSIONS
our findings show that the mitochondrial rps <dig> gene has, most likely, been functionally transferred to the nucleus at least three times during the evolution of the poales. we extend the one previously recognized transfer from a limited number of grasses to the full breadth of grasses and date its occurrence to roughly  <dig> million years ago. we describe two new cases of rps <dig> transfer: a comparably old transfer in the cyperaceae and a much younger, putative transfer in the joinvilleaceae. surprisingly, despite the great age of the poaceae and cyperaceae transfers , nearly intact and expressed pseudogenes of rps <dig> have persisted in the mitochondrial genomes of most lineages of the two families. to our knowledge, such long-term, nearly pervasive survival of expressed pseudogenes is unparalleled in any other gene or genome. why this is so is not entirely clear. it probably reflects a combination of factors, including the simple nature of plant mitochondrial expression sequences and the short length of rps <dig> , low rates of nucleotide substitutions and indels in plant mtdnas, and  the presence of an intact, functional rpl <dig> gene immediately upstream of rps <dig>  such survival also raises the possibility that, at least in the poales, rps <dig> may harbour some functionally important sequence element that is unrelated to its ribosomal-protein-encoding function. overall, these findings indicate that intracellular gene transfer may occur even more frequently in angiosperms than already recognized and that pseudogenes in plant mitochondrial genomes can be surprisingly resistant to forces that lead to gene loss and inactivation.
