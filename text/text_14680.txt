BACKGROUND
plant acyl-acyl carrier protein  thioesterases  hydrolyze acyl-acp thioester bonds, releasing free fatty acids and acp. plant acyl-acp tes are nuclear encoded, plastid-targeted globular proteins  <cit>  that are functional as dimers  <cit> . their activity represents the terminal step in the plastidial fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. the resulting free fatty acids enter the cytosol where they are esterified to coenzyme a and further metabolized into membrane lipids and/or storage triacylglycerols.

plant acyl-acp tes have characteristic chain length specificities that vary from 8– <dig> carbons, and the substrate preferences of individual tes have been shown to play a key role in determining the composition of storage lipids  <cit> . based on amino acid sequence alignments, the plant tes have been shown to cluster into two families, fatas, which show marked preference for 18:1-acp with minor activity towards 18:0- and 16:0-acps; and fatbs, which hydrolyze primarily saturated acyl-acps with chain lengths that vary between 8– <dig> carbons  <cit> . fatas and fatbs both contain predicted ~ <dig> amino acid transit peptides, however, fatbs have an additional conserved hydrophobic 18-residue domain that can be removed without affecting activity and which has been proposed to form a helical transmembrane anchor  <cit> . with the exception of two short regions that are unique to each class, the fata and fatb sequences contain a core region of ~ <dig> residues that show dispersed sequence similarity throughout.

because of their importance in determining which fatty acids are stored in seed oil, several studies have focused on engineering plant tes with altered substrate specificities as a strategy for tailoring specialty seed oils  <cit> . these studies have taken advantage of the rich diversity of sequence information available for the plant thioesterases and used a sequence-based approach to engineering plant thioesterases with altered substrate specificity  <cit> . however, the large amount of sequence variation between the fata and fatb types of plant tes makes it difficult to determine which amino acid residues are particularly important for substrate specificity.

when the amount of sequence variation between groups is high, bioinformatics tools can guide the development of a hierarchy of amino acid residues potentially important for specificity. the likelihood of success of this approach for the plant acyl-acp tes is increased by the availability of the above mentioned sequence information as well as by a 3d structural model of the fatb enzyme  <cit> . furthermore, to assist in such an approach we recently developed the computer program conserved property difference locator   <cit> . cpdl identifies positions in an alignment of two functional classes of homologous proteins where each class has a conserved but different amino acid residue. this type of position has been shown repeatedly to be involved in functional specialization and of use in engineering proteins to switch their function from one class to that of the other  <cit> . once identified by cpdl, these residues can be targeted for reciprocal switches between the two groups to introduce variability and evaluate their effects on enzyme function. cpdl identified many positions in the thioesterase family that show differences in either sequence or amino acid properties between the fata and fatb classes. we evaluated the effects of several of the most dramatic changes identified by cpdl on thioesterase activity and substrate specificity. using this approach we were able to identify four positions which influence the substrate specificity of the enzyme.

RESULTS
description of the homologous classes
the two functional classes of plant acyl-acp thioesterases  are well-defined in phylogenetic trees  constructed from multiple sequence alignment information . each thioesterase contains a transit peptide of variable sequence at the n-terminus that signals their import into the chloroplast, thus only the mature protein sequences were considered in our analyses . overall, the family has relatively low sequence identity , although identity is higher within classes . residues that are completely conserved within the family include n <dig>  h <dig>  and c <dig> , each of which has been implicated in catalysis and may form a papain-like catalytic triad  <cit> .

cpdl-identified positions
of the > <dig> positions within the thioesterase alignments, cpdl identified  <dig> positions within the family where there is conservation of sequence and  <dig> positions where there is conservation of amino acid properties within one of the classes . at nine positions, residues are conserved in each class but different between classes and are thus annotated with hourglasses . four of the nine hourglass positions are colored black, indicating conservative differences between the classes. the other five hourglasses are red and denote non-conservative differences between the classes. many positions are marked with orange circles to denote property differences that are not necessarily accompanied by a consistent sequence difference. one such position is  <dig> where the fatb's always contain a charged residue  while the fata's always contain the neutral glutamine.

because they represent the most dramatic differences between the two thioesterase classes, we chose to evaluate the effect of each of the residues flagged with red hourglass icons. we also chose to examine the effect of position  <dig> as an example in which enzyme sequence is not conserved, but a particular property difference  is conserved.

in vivo thioesterase activity of cpdl variants
each variant was evaluated in a bacterial expression system that allows determination of enzyme activity by measurement of the fatty acids present in the medium  <cit> . individual colonies containing te variants were grown in liquid medium at 30°c for  <dig> hr. the medium was collected and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared and then analyzed by gcms. these assays showed that each mutation had an effect on thioesterase activity . in particular, the v110t and w221r mutations were detrimental and had little detectable activity in the in vivo e. coli assay. while the m141t mutation lost ~75% total activity,  some activity towards 16: <dig> was preferentially retained . furthermore, the amount of fatty acid in the medium represented by 16: <dig> for the m141t variant is ~70% as compared to ~46% in the parent. the m74a and k86q mutations each decreased total activity slightly  and showed a shift in specificity away from 14: <dig> and 16: <dig> . the s174q mutation resulted in only a slight decrease in total activity , a decrease in both 14: <dig> and 16: <dig>  and an increase in 16: <dig> and 18: <dig> as compared to the parent enzyme . two variants containing combinations of three  or four  active mutations showed further reductions in activity .

because the m141t mutation substantially re-oriented specificity toward 16: <dig>  we wanted to determine what effect other residues at this position might have on te activity and specificity. of the  <dig> saturation mutagenesis variants chosen for fame analysis, none were found to have more 16: <dig> in the medium than the m141t variant . variants containing arginine, leucine, or isoleucine produced amounts of 16: <dig> similar to the threonine variant and were equally active while those containing glycine or phenylalanine were less active and produced less 16: <dig> than the threonine variant . sequencing of several active and inactive variants showed that the library contained at least  <dig> of the  <dig> possible codons at position  <dig>  of the  <dig> variants sequenced , none had valine, glutamine, or histidine at position  <dig>  all other amino acids were represented in the library.

agar-plate based screen for te activity
when plated on btna agar, there are subtle changes in colony morphology between variants expressing active plant acyl-acp tes and those expressing inactive tes . however, we hoped to identify a more dramatic difference in order to facilitate future screening of libraries of variant tes. reasoning that the fatty acids eliminated into the growth medium by e. coli strain k <dig> would decrease the local ph around colonies that were expressing active variants of the plant acyl-acp te, we set out to find a ph indicator that could be added to agar plates for screening purposes. we were able to reproducibly screen for te activity using standard macconkey agar with lactose as the sugar source; the ph indicator neutral red changes from red  to yellow . a range of intensity in the red color is apparent when evaluating colonies that express tes with a range of activities . however, the color of the variants expressing an active plant te is white not red, as would be expected if the color change were being caused by the lower ph due to the excreted fatty acid. thus, instead of reflecting a change in the local ph around active te variants, the neutral red indicator may actually reflect a difference in the composition and stability of the bacterial membrane. for example, the ability to take up neutral red from the medium has been linked to virulence in mycobacterium tuberculosis and has been shown to be the result of changes in the fatty acid composition and external surface of the cell membrane  <cit> .

discussion
the modification of thioesterase specificity has proven to be useful for genetic engineering of plants containing high levels of commercially-useful fatty acids. for example, expression of a thioesterase from the california bay laurel  in canola allowed the commercial production of a genetically engineered oil crop containing large amounts of laurate  <cit>  while expression of a thioesterase from garcinia mangostana in canola resulted in seeds containing increased amounts of stearate  <cit> .

using an approach that compares the sequences of homologous enzymes with different substrate specificities, the substrate specificity of plant thioesterases has been shown to be mutable. however, the large number of amino acid differences between any two homologous tes makes it difficult to identify the subset of amino acid changes that will result in a change in specificity. one commonly used approach to reduce the number of possible sdps is to generate chimeric enzymes  <cit> . using this approach, it was found that the normally high 12: <dig> specificity of the umbellularia californica fatb enzyme can be switched to 14: <dig> by three amino acid changes   <cit> . however, oftentimes the resulting chimeric enzymes are either inactive or exhibit no change in specificity  <cit> . what would be helpful is a method that allows the reduction of the possible sdps to a manageable, ranked set where each change can be individually examined experimentally.

we previously reported on the conserved property difference locator  which was designed for use in such situations  <cit> . cpdl uses as input the amino acid sequence alignment of a group of enzymes broken into two homologous classes and then flags positions where there is a difference in either amino acid sequence or a property such as hydrophobicity  <cit> . from the alignment of fata versus fatb tes, cpdl identified several potential specificity-determining positions. we chose to use the most stringent cpdl criteria and therefore individually engineered into the parent enzyme the six most dramatic changes, including five non-conservative changes and one position with a difference in amino acid charge between fatas and fatbs.

interestingly, four of the five residues flagged with red hourglasses identified by cpdl as putative specificity-determining positions  are located in a structural element referred to as the n-terminal hot dog domain  <cit> . through the construction of chimeric enzymes, this region has been shown to control specificity  <cit> . the remaining position flagged by a red hourglass  is near the catalytic asparagine and histidine in the second hot dog domain. however, only one of the four residues flagged with black  hourglasses identified by cpdl is in the n-terminal hot dog domain, lending validity to the selection of sites that contain conservative versus non-conservative substitutions between classes as a criterion for ranking putative specificity determining positions.

each of these six changes suggested by cpdl were individually engineered into the parent fatb enzyme and the effect of the change was determined experimentally. mutations at each cpdl-identified position substantially affected thioesterase activity and/or specificity. two of the six  essentially inactivated the enzyme while the other four mutations affected substrate specificity to some degree. it is interesting to note that unlike previous studies  <cit> , combinations of mutations at multiple cpdl-identified positions  did not improve enzymatic performance and in fact, came close to eliminating activity.

we recently modeled the predicted structure of the plant acyl-acp thioesterases  <cit> . using this model, we mapped the cpdl mutations relative to the predicted active site of the thioesterase . each of the positions is located within  <dig> angstroms of the nearest catalytic residue. the monomer of the enzyme itself in the structural model is ~ <dig> × ~ <dig> × ~ <dig> angstroms. mutations at the two positions farthest away from the catalytic site  have been shown to affect enzyme specificity . mutations at the two positions closest to the catalytic site  essentially inactivated the enzyme . position  <dig> shifted specificity toward 16: <dig> in vivo and is located on one of the b-sheets. position  <dig>  which caused a shift in specificity from 14: <dig> and 16: <dig> toward 16: <dig> and 18: <dig>  is located  <dig> angstroms from its closest catalytic neighbor and is on a flexible loop that has the potential to shift during binding and/or catalysis. because this is a flexible region, there is some uncertainty regarding its conformation in the fatb structure relative to the fatb model based on threading onto the 1bvq structure  <cit> .

many characteristic properties of the amino acid residues present at the cpdl-identified positions are also different between the classes. to summarize these changes, the alanine is smaller than the methionine at position  <dig>  the threonine is smaller than methionine and has an oh group at position  <dig>  the lysine to glutamine change at position  <dig> removes a positive charge and adds an amine group, the serine to glutamine change at position  <dig> removes an oh and adds and amine, the valine to threonine change at position  <dig> adds an oh, and the tryptophan to arginine change at position  <dig> removes a bulky aromatic side chain and adds a positive charge. the net affect of these changes appears to be a widening of the substrate binding pocket in fata as compared to fatb .

the results presented here further demonstrate the viability of a sequence based approach as opposed to a more time consuming and complicated approach based on x-ray crystallography. development of the cpdl tool facilitated a sequence-based bioinformatics approach to engineering plant acyl-acp thioesterases for alterations in substrate specificity. furthermore, cpdl analysis provides a straightforward method for generating hypotheses that can readily be tested regarding specificity determining positions within enzymes.

CONCLUSIONS
based on comparison of families of fata and fatb te sequences the cpdl program was used to identify six putative specificity determining positions. substitutions of fata equivalents into fatb resulted in changes in specificity at four of the positions validating the in silico cpdl predictions. in addition, a novel colorimetric screen able to discriminate between the expression of active and inactive tes is presented.
