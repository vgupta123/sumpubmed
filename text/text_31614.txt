BACKGROUND
network terminology is used to study important questions in systems biology. for example, networks are used to study functional enrichment  <cit> , to analyze the structure of cellular networks  <cit> , to model biological signalling or regulatory networks  <cit> , to reconstruct metabolic networks  <cit> , and to study the dynamic behavior of gene regulatory networks  <cit> .

here we study the meaning of network concepts in relatively simple networks, e.g. gene co-expression networks and protein-protein interaction  networks. specifically, we consider undirected networks that can be represented by a symmetric adjacency matrix a = , where the pairwise adjacency  aij takes values in the unit interval, i.e.,  <dig> ≤ aij ≤  <dig>  for an unweighted network, the adjacency aij =  <dig> if nodes i and j are connected and  <dig> otherwise. for a weighted network,  <dig> ≤ aij ≤  <dig>  for notational convenience, we set the diagonal elements to  <dig> 

fundamental network concepts
other authors refer to network concepts as network statistics or network indices. network concepts include connectivity, mean connectivity, density, variance of the connectivity  etc. network concepts can be used as descriptive statistics for networks. while some network concepts  have found important uses in biology and genetics, other network concepts  appear less interesting to biologists. before attempting to understand why some concepts are more interesting than others, it is important to understand how network concepts relate to each other in biologically interesting networks. as a step toward this goal, we explore the meaning of network concepts in module networks, which are defined below.

in the following, we review fundamental network concepts. further details on the definitions and notations can be found in the methods section.

the node connectivity is given by

  connectivityi=ki=∑j≠iaij. 

in unweighted networks, the connectivity ki of node i equals the number of directly linked neighbors. in weighted networks, the connectivity equals the sum of connection weights with all other nodes. highly connected 'hub' genes are thought to play an important role in organizing the behavior of biological networks  <cit> . connectivity has been found to be an important complementary gene screening variable for finding biologically significant genes in cancer  <cit>  and primate brain development  <cit> .

the line density  <cit>  is defined as the mean off-diagonal adjacency and is closely related to the mean connectivity.

  density=∑i∑j≠iaijn=s1n=meann− <dig>  

where the function sp is defined for a vector v as sp = ∑ivip = τ  <dig> 

the normalized connectivity centralization  is a simple and widely used index of the connectivity distribution. by definition  <cit> , the normalized connectivity centralization is given by

  centralization=nn−2n−1−density)≈max⁡n−density. 

a frequent question of social network analysis concerns the causes and consequences of centralization in network structure, i.e. the extent to which certain nodes are far more central than others within the network in question. the centralization index has been used to describe structural differences of metabolic networks  <cit> .

many measures of network heterogeneity are based on the variance of the connectivity, and authors differ on how to scale the variance  <cit> . our definition of the network heterogeneity equals the coefficient of variation of the connectivity distribution, i.e.

  heterogeneity=variancemean=ns2s12− <dig>  

this heterogeneity measure is scale invariant with respect to multiplying the connectivity by a scalar. biological networks tend to be very heterogeneous: while some 'hub' nodes are highly connected, the majority of nodes tend to have very few connections. describing the heterogeneity  of the connectivity  distribution has been the focus of considerable research in recent years  <cit> .

the clustering coefficient of node i is a density measure of local connections, or 'cliquishness'  <cit> . specifically,

  clustercoefi=niπi=∑l≠i∑m≠i,lailalmami{2−∑l≠iail2}. 

in unweighted networks, ni equals twice the number of direct connections among the nodes connected to node i, and πi equals twice the maximum possible number of direct connections among the nodes connected to node i. consequently, clustercoefi equals  <dig> if and only if all neighbors of i are also connected to each other. for general weighted networks with  <dig> ≤ aij ≤  <dig>  one can prove  <dig> ≤ clustercoefi ≤  <dig>  <cit> . the relationship between the clustering coefficient and modular structure has been investigated by several authors  <cit> .

the topological overlap between nodes i and j reflects their relative interconnectedness  <cit> . it is defined by

  topoverlapij=lij+aijmin⁡{ki,kj}+1−aij, 

where lij = ∑u≠i,jaiuauj. in an unweighted network, lij equals the number of nodes to which both i and j are connected. in this case, topoverlapij =  <dig> if the node with fewer connections satisfies two conditions:  all of its neighbors are also neighbors of the other node, and  it is connected to the other node. in contrast, topoverlapij =  <dig> if i and j are un-connected and the two nodes do not share any neighbors. by convention, topoverlapii =  <dig>  one can prove that  <dig> ≤ aij ≤  <dig> implies  <dig> ≤ topoverlapij ≤  <dig>  <cit> .

the topological overlap matrix can be considered as adjacency matrix
since the matrix topoverlap =  is symmetric and its entries lie in  <cit> , it satisfies our assumptions on an adjacency matrix. roughly speaking, the topological overlap matrix can be considered as a 'smoothed out' version of the adjacency matrix. the elements of topoverlap provide an alternative measure of connection strength based on shared neighbors. there is evidence that replacing a by topoverlap may counter the adverse effects of spurious or missing adjacencies  <cit> . since the adjacency matrices of the ppi networks in our applications were very sparse, we replaced them by the corresponding topological overlap matrices. in contrast, we used the original adjacency matrix when analyzing gene co-expression networks since high specificity is desirable for measuring interconnectedness in co-expression networks.

the topological overlap matrix can be used for module definition
our main interest lies in networks comprised of nodes that form a module inside a larger network. since a particular module network may encode a pathway or a protein complex, these special types of networks have great practical importance. similar to the term 'cluster', no consensus on the meaning of the term 'module' seems to exist in the literature. in our applications, we use a clustering procedure to identify modules  of nodes with high topological overlap. we follow the suggestion of  <cit>  to turn the topological overlap matrix topoverlap into a dissimilarity measure by subtracting it from  <dig>  i.e. disstopoverlapij =  <dig> - topoverlapij.

we use disstopoverlapij as input of average linkage hierarchical clustering to arrive at a dendrogram   <cit> . modules are defined as the branches of the dendrogram. for example, in figure  <dig> we show the dendrograms of our network applications. genes or proteins of proper modules are assigned a color . genes outside any proper module are colored grey. our module definition depends on how the branches are cut off the dendrogram. several methods and criteria for identifying branches in a dendrogram have been proposed, see e.g.  <cit> . in practice, it is advisable to study how robust the results are with respect to alternative module detection methods. in our online r software tutorial, we show that our findings are highly robust with respect to alternative module definitions. in addition, we use a functional enrichment analysis of the resulting modules to provide indirect evidence that the modules are biologically meaningful. our module detection approach has led to biologically meaningful modules in several applications  <cit>  but we make no claim that it is optimal. our theoretical results will apply to all module detection methods that result in approximately factorizable networks.

RESULTS
conformity and factorizable networks
we define an adjacency matrix a to be exactly factorizable if, and only if, there exists a vector cf with non-negative elements such that

  aij = cficfj    for all   i ≠ j 

if the non-negative solution of equation  is unique, it is referred to as conformity vector cf and cfi is the conformity of node i. one can easily show that the vector cf is not unique if the network contains only n =  <dig> nodes. however, for n >  <dig> it is unique for a weighted network, see our derivations surrounding equation .

we also define the concept of conformity for a general, non-factorizable network. the idea is to find an exactly factorizable adjacency matrix acf = cf cfτ - diag + i that best approximates a. note that the diagonal elements of acf and a equal  <dig> 

in the appendix, we define the conformity as a maximizer of the factorizability function fa=1−∑i∑j≠i2∑i∑j≠i <dig>  alternative methods of decomposing an adjacency matrix are briefly discussed below.

in equation , we define a measure of network factorizability as follows

 f=1−‖−‖f2‖a−i‖f <dig>  

the factorizability f is normalized to take on values in the unit interval  <cit> . the higher f, the better acf - i approximates a - i.

modules can be approximately factorizable
approximate factorizability is a very strong structural assumption on an adjacency matrix. it certainly does not hold for general networks. however, we provide empirical evidence that many clusters  of genes or proteins in real networks are approximately factorizable. table  <dig> reports the mean values of f for the applications considered in this paper. for example in the drosophila ppi network, the mean factorizability f is  <dig>  across 'proper' modules defined as clusters in the network. in contrast, the factorizability of the subnetwork comprised of non-module nodes is only  <dig> . in the yeast ppi network, the mean factorizability of proper modules is  <dig>  while it equals only  <dig>  for the grey module. in the weighted yeast gene co-expression network, the mean factorizability of proper modules equals  <dig>  while it is only  <dig>  for the improper module. similarly in the unweighted yeast gene co-expression network, the mean factorizability of proper modules equals  <dig>  while it is only  <dig>  for the improper module. a more detailed table presenting network concepts in each module is also provided .

each network contained several proper modules. non-module genes were grouped into a single  grey module. for each concept, we report the mean and standard error across the proper modules. a more detailed table presenting network concepts in each module is also provided .

our empirical results support the following

observation  <dig> for many modules defined with a clustering procedure, the subnetwork comprised of the module nodes is approximately factorizable.

this observation motivates us to study network concepts in approximately factorizable networks.

conformity-based network concepts
we refer to the standard network concepts known from the literature as fundamental network concepts. in general, fundamental network concepts are functions of the off-diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix a. more precisely, we use network concept functions to define different types of network concepts depending on the input matrix ). for example, when inputting an adjacency matrix with its diagonal elements replaced by  <dig>  one arrives at fundamental network concepts . when inputting the conformity-based  adjacency matrix acf with its diagonal elements replaced by  <dig>  one arrives at cf-based network concepts . the conformity vector can be used to define the approximate cf-based matrix

a network concept arises by evaluating a network concept function on a special type of input matrix. we assume that the diagonal elements of the matrix a - i are  <dig> 

 acf,app = cf cfτ = . 

note that the i-th diagonal element of acf,app equals cfi <dig>  when acf,app is used as input of a network concept function, one arrives at an approximate cf-based concept .

we will demonstrate that approximate cf-based concepts satisfy simple relationships. below, we show that these simple relationships carry over to fundamental network concepts in approximately factorizable networks.

in definition  <dig>  we provide a formula for calculating approximate cf-based analogs of the fundamental network concepts. specifically, we find

  kcf,app,i=cfis <dig> densitycf,app=s12n≈n) <dig> centralizationcf,app=ns1−s1n)≈s1n−s1n),heterogeneitycf,app=ns2)2− <dig> clustercoefcf,app,i=s1) <dig> topoverlapcf,app,ij=cficfj+1)min⁡s1+1−cficfj, 

where sp = ∑ip. note that the approximate cf-based clustering coefficient does not depend on the i-index. this is why we sometimes omit this index and simply write clustercoefcf,app.

approximate cf-based network concepts satisfy simple relationships
here we demonstrate a major advantage of approximate cf-based network concepts: they exhibit simple relationships. using the fact that s <dig> = s <dig>  and the approximation n/ ≈  <dig>  equations  imply the following relationship

 heterogeneitycf,app≈clustercoefcf,appdensitycf,app− <dig>  

or equivalently,

  clustercoefcf,app,i≈2×densitycf,app. 

further, it is straightforward to derive a simple relationship between approximate cf-based topological overlap, connectivity and heterogeneity under the following mild assumptions: 1s2≈ <dig> and 1−cficfjmin⁡s1≈ <dig>  specifically, we find

  topoverlapcf,app,ij≈max⁡s2s1=max⁡,cfjs1)nns2s12≈max⁡n. 

in the following subsection, we outline the conditions when equations  and  hold approximately for fundamental network concepts in approximately factorizable module networks.

relating fundamental- to approximate cf-based concepts
in the methods section, we provide a heuristic argument for the following

observation  <dig> in approximately factorizable networks, fundamental network concepts are approximately equal to their approximate cf-based analogs,

 fundamentalnetworkconcept ≈ networkconceptcf,app. 

the observation implies that in approximately factorizable networks, connectivity ≈ connectivitycf,app and density ≈ densitycf,app, etc. observation  <dig> is illustrated for network density, centralization, heterogeneity, and clustering coefficients in figure  <dig> , figure  <dig> , and figure  <dig> . a consequence of this observation is that the simple relationships satisfied by approximate cf-based network concepts also apply to their corresponding fundamental network concepts in approximately factorizable networks. in particular, equations  and  imply the following

observation  <dig> in approximately factorizable networks, the following relationships hold among fundamental network concepts

  mean ≈  <dig> × density, 

and

  topoverlapij≈max⁡n. 

observation  <dig> is important since it highlights the fact that seemingly disparate network concepts satisfy simple and intuitive relationships in approximately factorizable networks. equations  and  are illustrated in figure  <dig> , figure  <dig> , and figure  <dig> . equation  has several important consequences. to begin with, it illustrates that the topological overlap between the most highly connected node and all other nodes is approximately constant. specifically, if we denote the index of the most highly connected node by  <cit>  and its connectivity by k <cit>  = max, then

  topoverlap <cit> j≈k <cit> n. 

as an aside, we briefly mention that topoverlap <cit> j has a simple interpretation in terms of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram that results from using disstopoverlapij =  <dig> -topoverlapij as input. in this case, topoverlap <cit> j is related to the longest branch length in the dendrogram.

in the following, we relate topoverlap <cit> j to the fundamental network concept centralization. according to equation , max⁡n ≈ centralization + density. substituting this expression in equation  implies

  topoverlap <cit> j ≈ . 

equation  is illustrated in figure  <dig> , figure  <dig> , and figure  <dig> .

in factorizable networks, fundamental network concepts are simple functions of the connectivity
here we demonstrate another advantage of approximate cf-based network concepts. they allow one to relate fundamental network concepts to simple functions of the connectivity. toward this end, note the following simple relationship between the conformity cf and the approximate cf-based connectivity kcf,app:

  cfi=kcf,app,is <dig>  

since in approximately factorizable networks kcf,i ≈ ki, we find that the conformity cf is approximately given by the scaled connectivity, i.e.

  cf≈ks <dig>  

this equation shows that conformity can be interpreted as a scaled connectivity in approximately factorizable networks. since approximate cf-based network concepts are simple functions of the conformity, substituting ks <dig> for cf implies that approximate cf-based concepts can be approximated by simple functions of the connectivity. for example, we find the following simple expressions for the cluster coefficient and the topological overlap.

protein-protein interaction and gene co-expression network applications
drosophila and yeast protein-protein network
to illustrate our results, we computed network concepts in module networks based on drosophila and yeast protein-protein interaction  networks downloaded from biogrid  <cit> . as described before, we defined the modules as branches of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram, see figure  <dig> 

of the  <dig> proteins in the drosophila ppi network,  <dig> were clustered into  <dig> modules, and the remaining proteins grouped into an improper  module. the module sizes of the proper modules range from  <dig> to  <dig>  mean  <dig> , median  <dig>  and interquartile range  <dig> 

of the  <dig> proteins in the yeast ppi network,  <dig> were clustered into  <dig> proper modules, and the remaining proteins grouped into an improper module. the module sizes of the proper modules range from  <dig> to  <dig>  mean  <dig> , median  <dig>  and interquartile range  <dig> .

yeast gene co-expression networks
we now illustrate our theoretical results using gene co-expression networks that have been used by many authors, e.g.  <cit> . gene co-expression networks are constructed on the basis of microarray data from the transcriptional response of cells to changing conditions. there is evidence that genes with similar expression profiles are more likely to encode interacting proteins  <cit> .

in gene co-expression networks, nodes correspond to gene expression profiles. the corresponding adjacency matrix is determined from a measure of co-expression between the genes. in the examples below, we will use the absolute value of the pearson correlation coefficient between the gene expression profiles to measure co-expression between gene pairs. as detailed at the end of the methods section, one can transform the pearson correlation matrix into an adjacency matrix by hard thresholding or soft thresholding. hard thresholding results in an unweighted network and soft thresholding results in a weighted network  <cit> . we applied our methods to a yeast cell cycle microarray data comprised of  <dig> microarrays and  <dig> genes. this dataset recorded gene expression levels during different stages of cell cycles in yeasts and has been widely used before to illustrate clustering methods  <cit> .

of the  <dig> genes  in the weighted yeast gene co-expression network,  <dig> were clustered into  <dig> proper modules. the module sizes of the proper modules range from  <dig> to  <dig>  mean  <dig> , median  <dig> , and interquartile range  <dig> . to facilitate a comparison between the weighted and the unweighted gene co-expression networks, we used the module assignment of the weighted network for the unweighted network as well. it turns out that the module assignment is highly preserved between the weighted and the unweighted gene co-expression networks, see figures 1c) and 1d).

functional annotation of modules
since the scope of this paper is a mathematical and topological analysis of module networks, we defined modules without regard to external gene ontology information. also we do not provide an in-depth analysis of the biological meaning of the network modules. but we briefly mention that there is indirect evidence that most of the resulting modules are biologically meaningful. we used the functional gene annotation tools from the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit>  to test for both enriched biochemical pathways and subcellular compartmentalization. we find that most modules are significantly enriched with known gene ontologies. a functional enrichment analysis for each network application is provided. for the drosophila ppi network, ; for the yeast ppi network, ; for the weighted and unweighted yeast gene co-expression networks, .

empirical relationships in  <dig> different networks
in accordance with observation  <dig>  we find a close relationship  between the fundamental network concepts and their approximate cf-based analogs. specifically, we relate the network density, centralization, heterogeneity and clustering coefficients to their approximate cf-based analogs in figures  <dig> , figure  <dig> , and figure  <dig> .

in accordance with observation  <dig>  we find a close relationship  between the mean clustering coefficient mean  and  <dig> × density. further, we find a close relationship between topoverlap <cit> j and , see figures  <dig> , figure  <dig> , and figure  <dig> .

we find that our theoretical observations fit better in the weighted- than in the unweighted yeast gene co-expression network.

network concepts and module size
since the number of genes inside a module  varies greatly among the modules, it is natural to wonder whether the reported relationships between network concepts are due to the underlying module sizes. we find that the relationship between fundamental network concepts and their approximate cf-based analogs remains highly significant even after correcting for module sizes . the same holds for the relationships between network concepts. thus, none of the reported relationships is trivially due to module sizes. but we find that many network concepts depend on the underlying module size. we find that large modules are less factorizable than small modules: there is a strong negative correlation between module factorizability f and module size. we also find that fundamental network concepts  depend on module size in our applications. for the factorizability, density, centralization, heterogeneity and mean clustering coefficient, the correlation coefficients with module size are - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> ,  <dig> , and - <dig>  in drosophila ppi module networks; they are - <dig> , - <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and - <dig>  in yeast ppi module networks; they are - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> ,  <dig> , and - <dig>  in weighted yeast gene co-expression module networks; they are - <dig> , - <dig> , - <dig> ,  <dig> , and - <dig>  in unweighted yeast gene co-expression module networks. a more detailed analysis is presented in the additional files .

a simple exactly factorizable network example: constant network
a simple, exactly factorizable network is given by an adjacency matrix a with constant adjacencies . the adjacency matrix is exactly factorizable since aij = cficfj where cfi = b. this network can be interpreted as the expected adjacency matrix of an erdös-rényi network  <cit> . one can easily derive the following expressions for the fundamental network concepts: connectivityi = b, density = b, centralization =  <dig>  heterogeneity =  <dig>  clustercoefi = b and topoverlapij = b.

since a is exactly factorizable, the fundamental network concepts equal their cf-based analogs. however, the approximate cf-based concepts are different from their exact counterparts, see table  <dig>  for reasonably large values of n, the fundamental network concepts are very close to their approximate cf-based analogs. this illustrates observation  <dig>  with the results in table  <dig>  one can easily verify observation  <dig> and equation  in this example.

example: block diagonal adjacency matrix
in the following, we will consider a block diagonal adjacency matrix where each block has constant adjacencies, i.e.

  a=. 

we assume that the first and second blocks have dimensions n <dig> × n <dig> and n <dig> × n <dig>  respectively. such a block diagonal matrix can be interpreted as a network with two distinct modules. setting n <dig> =  <dig> results in the simple constant adjacency matrix, which we considered before.

we denote by f <dig> =  the vector whose first n <dig> components equal  <dig> and the remaining components equal  <dig>  similarly, we define f <dig> =  =  <dig> - f <dig>  to simplify the calculation of the conformity, we further assume that

  n2b22n1b12< <dig>  

then the conformity is uniquely defined by

 cf=b1f <dig>  

as one can show using equations  and  in the appendix. further, using proposition  <dig> in the appendix, one can show that the factorizability is given by

  f=n1b12n1b12+n2b <dig>  

in particular, if n <dig> ≈ n <dig> and b <dig> = b <dig>  i.e. if the adjacency matrix is comprised of two nearly identical blocks, the factorizability is f ≈ 1/ <dig>  similarly, one can show that if the matrix a is comprised of b identical blocks, then f ≈ 1/b.

this block diagonal network allows one to arrive at explicit formulas for fundamental-, cf-based-, and approximate cf-based network concepts, see table  <dig>

the indicator function ind takes on the value  <dig> if the condition is satisfied and  <dig> otherwise.

in the following, we study the relationship between fundamental network concepts and their approximate cf-based analogs in the limit when the block diagonal network becomes approximately factorizable. specifically, we calculate network concepts in the limit b <dig> →  <dig> when n <dig>  n <dig> and b <dig> are kept fixed. under this assumption, b2→  <dig> is equivalent to f →  <dig>  then, one can easily show that

 lim⁡f→1connectivityi=n1−1n1connectivitycf,app,i,lim⁡f→1density=n1−1n1densitycf,app,lim⁡f→1centralization=n1−1n1centralizationcf,app,lim⁡f→1heterogeneity=heterogeneitycf,app,lim⁡f→1topoverlapij=b1+1n1b1+1topoverlapcf,app,ij,lim⁡f→1clustercoefi=clustercoefcf,app,i. 

for reasonably large values of n <dig> , these limits illustrate observation  <dig>  similarly, one can easily verify observation  <dig> and equation  in the case when the factorizability f is close to  <dig> and n <dig> is reasonably large.

discussion
this paper does not describe a new software or method for constructing networks. instead, it presents theoretical results which clarify the mathematical relationship between network concepts in module networks. a deeper understanding of network concepts may guide the data analyst on how to construct and use networks in practice. our results will pertain to any network that is approximately factorizable irrespective of its construction method. while the term 'factorizable' network is new, numerous examples of these types of networks can be found in the literature, e.g.  <cit> . a recent physical model for experimentally determined protein-protein interactions is exactly factorizable  <cit> . in that model, the 'affinity' aij between proteins i and j is the product of the corresponding conformities. the conformities are approximately given by cfi = exp where ki is the number of hydrophobic residues in the i-th protein. another related example is an exactly factorizable random network model for which the edges between pairs of nodes are drawn according to a linking probability function  <cit> .

we find that in many applications, the conformity is highly related to the first eigenvector of the adjacency matrix. the idea of using a variant of the singular value decomposition for decomposing an adjacency matrix has been proposed by several authors  <cit> . however, we prefer to define the conformity as a maximizer of the factorizability function fa=1−∑i∑j≠i2∑i∑j≠i <dig> for the following reasons: first, the factorizability satisfies that fa =  <dig> if, and only if, a is exactly factorizable network with aij = cficfj. second, we prefer to define the conformity without reference to the diagonal elements aii of the adjacency matrix. third, the definition naturally fits within the framework of least squares factor analysis where conformity can be interpreted as the first factor  <cit> . an algorithm for computing the conformity in general networks is presented in the appendix. while network analysis focuses on the adjacency matrix, factor analysis takes as input a correlation or covariance matrix. in module networks, the first factor  corresponds to a normalized connectivity measure, see equation . future research could explore the network interpretation of higher order factors.

the topological structure of complex networks has been the focus of numerous studies, e.g.  <cit> . here we explore the structure of special types of networks, which we refer to as module networks.

to derive results for factorizable module networks, we define several novel terms including a measure of network factorizability f, conformity, cf-based network concepts, approximate cf-based network concepts.

the first result  uses both ppi and gene co-expression network data to show empirically that subnetworks comprised of module nodes are often approximately factorizable. this insight could be interesting to researchers who develop module detection methods. approximate factorizability is a very stringent structural assumption that is not satisfied in general networks. while modules in gene co-expression networks tend to be approximately factorizable if the corresponding expression profiles are highly correlated, the situation is more complicated for modules in ppi networks: only after replacing the original adjacency matrix by a 'smoothed out' version , do we find that the resulting modules are approximately factorizable.

the second result  shows that fundamental network concepts are approximately equal to their approximate cf-based analogs in approximately factorizable networks . while fundamental network concepts are defined with respect to the adjacency matrix, approximate cf-based network concepts are defined with respect to the conformity vector. the close relationship between fundamental and approximate cf-based concepts in module networks can be used to provide an intuitive interpretation of network concepts in modules. we demonstrate that these high correlations between module concepts remain significant even after adjusting the analysis for differences in module size .

the third result  shows that the mean clustering coefficient is determined by the density and the network heterogeneity in approximately factorizable networks. further, the topological overlap between two nodes is determined by the maximum of their respective connectivities and the heterogeneity. thus, seemingly disparate network concepts satisfy simple and intuitive relationships in these special but biologically important types of networks.

the fourth result  is that in approximately factorizable networks, fundamental network concepts can be expressed as simple functions of the connectivity. under mild assumptions, we argue that the clustering coefficient and the topological overlap matrix can be approximated by simple functions of the connectivity.

our empirical data also highlight how network concepts differ between subnetworks of 'proper' modules and the subnetwork comprised of improper  module nodes, see table  <dig>  for all applications, we find that proper modules have high factorizability, high density, high mean conformity. based on our theoretical derivations, it comes as no surprise that proper modules also have a high average clustering coefficient and a high centralization when compared to the improper module. but we find no difference in heterogeneity between proper and improper module networks.

as a consequence of approximate factorizability, network concepts with disparate meanings in social network theory are closely related in module networks. our results shed some light on the relationship between network concepts traditionally used by social scientists  and concepts used by systems biologists . for example, equation  shows that in module networks, the topological overlap between a hub gene and other module genes is related to the centralization.

CONCLUSIONS
using several protein-protein interaction and gene co-expression networks, we provide empirical evidence that subnetworks comprised of module nodes often satisfy an important structural property, which we call 'approximate factorizability'. in these types of networks, simple relationships exist between seemingly disparate network concepts. several network concepts with very different meanings in general networks turn out to be highly correlated across modules. these results are pertinent for systems biology since a biological pathways may correspond to an approximately factorizable module network.
