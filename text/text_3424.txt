BACKGROUND
cotton is an economically important crop; cotton fiber serves as the primary raw material for the textile industry. however, as environmental degradation continues, cotton is becoming increasingly subjected to extreme drought, high salinity and temperature extremes, each of which can impede plant growth and production
 <cit> . plant molecular responses to abiotic stresses involve interactions and crosstalk between many molecular pathways. hormones are important regulators of plant responses to abiotic stress. one of the most important stress-responsive plant hormones is abscisic acid . aba is one of the most important phytohormones and is a key regulator of plant responses to various environmental stresses
 <cit> . aba plays an important role in the tolerance of plants to drought and high salinity, and the mechanisms underlying aba activity have been studied extensively for several decades
 <cit> . the main functions of aba include regulating plant water balance and increasing osmotic stress tolerance by inducing seed dormancy, delaying seed germination and promoting stomatal closure
 <cit> . to date, many stress-responsive genes have been identified; many of these genes are regulated by aba. recently, several aba-deficient mutants have been reported in arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato and maize
 <cit> . without stress treatment, the growth of these mutants is comparable to that of wild-type plants. under drought stress, aba-deficient mutants exhibit poor growth or even death
 <cit> . studying these mutants has revealed the presence of two major stress-related pathways, i.e., aba-dependent and aba-independent gene pathways
 <cit> . for cotton, high throughput screening techniques such as transcriptome have been used to study the adaptability in drought. payton et al.
 <cit>  found that the majority of stress-responsive transcripts had tissue-specific expression patterns using root and leaf under the water-deficit stress. genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of cotton under drought stress revealed significant down- regulation of genes and pathways involved in fiber elongation and up-regulation of defense responsive genes under drought stress
 <cit> . using two accessions g. herbaceum with different tolerant to osmotic stress, ranjan et al.
 <cit>  found that drought tolerance for cotton was not because of a single molecular reason but was rather due to several unique mechanisms.

plants can receive and recognize signals and stimuli from the environment through various classes of receptors, including receptor-like kinase  proteins, which play important roles in signal transduction pathways
 <cit> . rlk proteins kinases are encoded by a multigene family, which represents one of the largest gene families in the arabidopsis genome, comprising at least  <dig> members
 <cit> , with approximately  <dig>  members in rice
 <cit> . the size variations of the rlk families have been affected by many factors such as natural and artificial selection, living environments, genome size variation, polyploidization
 <cit> . rlks are characterized by the presence of a signal sequence, an amino-terminal domain with a transmembrane region and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain
 <cit> . since the discovery of the first rlk many years ago, substantial efforts have been devoted to examining a few receptor-kinase genes. rlks participate in a diverse range of processes in response to plant hormones and environmental cues and are involved in the regulation of many physiological changes in plants such as self-incompatibility, endosperm and pollen development, brassinosteroid sensing, anthoptosis and stress and disease resistance
 <cit> . like arabidopsis brassinosteroid insensitive  <dig> 
 <cit> , clavata <dig> <cit>  and haesa <cit>  control plant growth and development under normal growth conditions. tomato pto <cit> , rice xa <dig> <cit>  and arabidopsis fls <dig> <cit>  take part in the plant defense response and in plant-microbe interactions. many researches suggested that rlks can play an important role in optimizing plant responses to drought stress
 <cit> . arabidopsis arck <dig> <cit> , ghr <dig> <cit>  and rpk <dig> <cit>  have been implicated in controlling plant abiotic stress tolerance. snrk2s  is a family of aba-activated protein kinases
 <cit> . in arabidopsis, three members of this family, srk2d/snrk <dig> , srk2e/ost1/snrk <dig>  and srk2i/snrk <dig> , regulate aba signaling both positively and globally
 <cit> . rice receptor-like kinase ossik <dig> was also proved to improve drought and salt stress tolerance
 <cit> .

cotton genes encoding protein kinases have been reported, but these genes function mainly in the regulation of cotton fiber development. to our knowledge, rlk genes associated with cotton abiotic stress have not previously been documented. the rlk gene  identified in this study was previously identified among a group of expressed resistance gene analogs that are induced by verticillium dahliae  in the disease-resistant cotton gossypium barbasense cv. hai <dig> 
 <cit> . transgenic cotton and arabidopsis plants that overexpress gbrlk show increased resistance to vd. in the current study, we cloned the promoter region of gbrlk and analyzed the expression of gbrlk in response to abiotic stress. the results of this study suggest that gbrlk can be induced by aba, drought stress and salinity. the overexpression of gbrlk in arabidopsis increased plant tolerance to drought and high salinity and increased sensitivity to aba. the analysis of this kinase gene will help elucidate the molecular basis of rlk protein function in abiotic stress tolerance in cotton. this study also provides a candidate gene for further research on aba signaling pathways in cotton and other plants subjected to abiotic stress.

RESULTS
phylogenetic relationships between gbrlk and other kinase proteins
a functional gbrlk gene , which was induced by verticillium dahliae, was previously identified among a group of expressed resistance gene analogs from the disease-resistant cotton gossypium barbasense cv. hai <dig> using race
 <cit> . the cdna was 1536-bp in length and the predicted orf starts at nucleotide  <dig> and ends at nucleotide  <dig>  encoding a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids. blastx searches revealed that the predicted product shared 68% identity and 75% similarity with the soybean g-type lectin s-receptor-like serine/threonine -protein kinase , 56% identity and 72% similarity with the rice pk <dig> , 48% and 65%  with the wheat tak <dig>  and 48% and 64%  with the barley receptor-like protein kinase, respectively. the protein possessed intact signature features of protein tyrosine kinases, and contained conserved motifs characteristic of i-xi of receptor-like protein kinases, which are possessed in the majority of protein kinases. multiple sequence alignments using blastx revealed that the protein shared homology in other regions with protein kinases from various other crop species . we therefore conclude that this protein may belong to the receptor-like protein kinase family and be a member of the rlk gene family. this gene was thereafter designated as g. barbadense receptor-like protein kinase . gbrlk contains an atp binding site , a d activation site , four n-glycosylation sites, four n-myristoylation sites, three c terminal phosphorylation sites, one amidation site, four tyrosine kinase ii phosphorylation sites, and a membrane-spanning region .

currently the ncbi databases contain  <dig> cotton sequences predicted to encode protein kinases, and among them, three  were known to be involved in fiber development. the functions of the other sequences were unknown. the phylogenetic relationship between the gbrlk protein and the other known cotton protein kinases via the construction of phylogenetic tree revealed that gbrlk protein was most closely related evolutionally to sequences adj <dig>  aeg <dig>  aea <dig>  adr <dig> and aat <dig> that were receptor kinase, somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> protein and putative leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein .

phylogenetic analysis was used to investigate the relationship among the gbrlk and other reported receptor-like kinase proteins from eudicot arabidopsis thaliana and lycopersicon esculentum monocot oryza sativa, and triticum aestivum. gbrlk protein was found to cluster together with other reported receptor-like kinase proteins .

temporal and spatial expression analysis of gbrlk under abiotic stress
quantitative real-time  was used to analyze the expression patterns of gbrlk in h <dig> leaves exposed to aba, drought, salinity, sa, meja and low temperature. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  gbrlk was induced in leaves but was differentially expressed in response to sa, meja and abiotic stresses. gbrlk expression was gradually up-regulated in leaves exposed to  <dig> to 4 h of aba treatment; the transcription level of gbrlk increased and peaked at 4 h, after which the level of mrna accumulation gradually declined after  <dig> to 12 h of aba treatment . when the seedlings were treated with peg <dig>  or nacl , the transcription level of gbrlk increased rapidly and reached the highest level after 12 h of treatment, followed by a rapid decline, reaching pretreatment levels after 24 h of treatment. the expression of gbrlk was not significantly altered under low temperature treatment, suggesting that gbrlk expression is not affected by cold stress . for the sa, the expression of gbrlk was induced and up-regulated at 8 h and peaked at 12 h . when the seedlings were treated with meja, the transcription level of gbrlk peaked rapidly at 8 h and declined rapidly and reached pretreatment levels at 10 h .

to further understand the temporal-spatial distribution of gbrlk gene, we analyze the expression patterns of gbrlk in h <dig> different tissue. the results indicated that the gbrlk transcripts were difference significant in different tissue. the maximal transcripts of gbrlk were detected at  <dig> dpa . this implied that the gbrlk gene may play a multi-functional role in different development stages.

cloning and analysis of the gbrlk promoter
to further study the characteristics of gbrlk expression, we cloned the promoter sequence of gbrlk. the sefa-pcr generated a  <dig> -bp fragment, including a 347-bp region containing previously identified sequences . the transcriptional start site and several regulatory elements were predicted using tools including neural network promoter prediction
 <cit> , plantcare
 <cit>  and place
 <cit> . the  <dig> -bp fragment contained many cis-acting stress-responsive elements, such as abre, w-box, myb-core, w-box core, tca-element and others .

the  <dig> -bp fragment  on the 5′ region upstream of the initiation codon of the gbrlk promoter transferred into arabidopsis to address the regulatory mechanisms employed by the gbrlk promoter. the resulting transgenic arabidopsis lines were designated p-1890/gus. histochemical staining revealed that gus expression occurred mainly in the vascular bundles  and was strictly confined to the leaf veins , petioles  and roots , but not or very low in the cotyledons  or root hairs  of transgenic arabidopsis . therefore, the gbrlk promoter displayed a tissue-specific expression pattern. this differed from the expression pattern in plants transformed with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35s  promoter controlling gus, which served as a positive control. these plants exhibited constitutive gus expression .

the expression of gbrlk has been shown to respond to stress stimuli; therefore, our next step was to test whether the application of stress stimuli could trigger the expression of the gbrlk promoter. the induction of gus activity was observed in ground tissues of p-1890/gus transgenic plants upon treatment with aba, peg, nacl or v. dahlia. as shown in figure 
2b, the application of aba, peg, nacl or v. dahlia activated gus expression in the tissues of p-1890/gus plants, increasing the gus activity level by  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> -fold, respectively, which differed from that of plants containing gus driven by the 35s  promoter . interestingly, gus activity was strongly induced by aba treatment . additionally, various stresses rapidly induced increasing transcript level of gus gene .

overexpression of gbrlk improved salt and drought tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis
the 35s::gbrlk construct was introduced into arabidopsis ecotype col- <dig> and four independent fertile primary arabidopsis transformants were regenerated, and positive transgenic plants were confirmed by pcr detection of nptii and 35s-gbrlk . these t <dig> transgenic lines were self-pollinated to produce four homozygous lines, which were designated k- <dig>  k- <dig>  k- <dig> and k- <dig>  southern blotting analysis demonstrated that these lines arose from independent transformants, and each line carried between one and three copies of the gbrlk gene . the results of qrt-pcr revealed that gbrlk was expressed in all four transgenic arabidopsis lines, with the highest level of expression in the k- <dig> line . the four transgenic lines showed no morphological aberrations through the t <dig> generation. no consistent difference in fresh weight was observed between the control and transgenic arabidopsis lines .

the analysis of the transgenic plants tolerance to drought revealed that the wild-type plants showed more severe symptoms than the transgenic plants . only 10% of the wt plants survived to maturity, whereas 58%, 51%, 47% and 36% of the transgenic plants survived in lines k- <dig>  k- <dig>  k- <dig> and k- <dig>  respectively . for analysis of high-salt tolerance, 3-week-old seedlings of transgenic and wild-type arabidopsis grown in pots  were irrigated with a solution containing 200 mm nacl once a week for 5 weeks. as shown in figure 
3a, both the transgenic and wild-type plants showed etiolation and yellowing, but the leaves of the wt plants wilted, and some of the wt plants died. the survival rate was approximately 27% in the wt compared to 80%, 65%, 64% and 49%, respectively in the four transgenic lines . additionally, there were also significant differences in fresh weight , rosette diameter, anthocyanin accumulation, chlorophyll content and level of leaf chlorosis between the transgenic and the wt plants suffered drought and salt stresses . it is concluded that the transgenic arabidopsis lines are more tolerant to drought and salt stresses compared to the wt, and among these transgenic lines, k- <dig> showed the highest tolerance, consistent with the expression level of the gbrlk. overall, the wt plants showed more serious symptoms than the transgenic plants.

the data were acquired from the 3 week old plants treated by withholding irrigation for 3 weeks. data represent the mean ± se ; similar results were obtained from three independent experiments. n: wild-type col- <dig> suffered drought stress, and p: non-treatment wild-type col- <dig>  significance of the phenotypic results was assessed using student’s t tests .

the data of fw, rosette diameter, content of chlorophyll and anthocyanin were acquired from the 3 week old plants treated by submerging the roots of the plants in 200 mm nacl solution for 3 weeks. the data of rate of chlorosis and germination rates were acquired from plants grown on ms medium containing different concentration nacl for 2 weeks. data represent the mean ± se ; similar results were obtained from three independent experiments. n: wild-type col- <dig> suffered drought stress, and p: non-treatment wild-type col- <dig>  significance of the phenotypic results was assessed using student’s t tests .

furthermore, assays of water loss from detached leaves showed that the transgenic plants lost water much more slowly than the wt plants. at 360 min, the water loss rates were  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the transgenic lines k- <dig>  k- <dig>  k- <dig> and k- <dig>  respectively, compared to  <dig> % in the wt plants . these results suggest that the overexpression of gbrlk reduces water loss and increases drought tolerance in transgenic plants. therefore, gbrlk may function as a positive regulator of plant responses to drought stress.

transgenic arabidopsis plants were more sensitive to aba than wt
to examine changes in the response of gbrlk transgenic plants to aba, we investigated the aba sensitivity of the transgenic plant. under aba treatment, the germination rates of the transgenic lines were greatly reduced . when grown on ms medium containing 100 nmol aba for  <dig>   <dig> and 3 weeks, the transgenic plants exhibited many abnormal phenotypes such as dwarfing, etiolation and malformation . furthermore, root elongation in the 35s::gbrlk transgenic lines was hypersensitive to aba . these results demonstrate that aba suppresses seed germination, root elongation and plant growth rates more strongly in gbrlk transgenic plants than in the wt. this indicates that aba application activates the gbrlk protein or triggers other responses in transgenic plants. in addition, these results also suggest that the gbrlk protein activates or participates in aba-dependent signal transduction cascades or plays an important regulatory role in aba and stress responses.

gbrlk overexpression altered the expression pattern of stress-responsive genes in transgenic arabidopsis
to reveal the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the improvement of stress resistance and tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis thaliana by gbrlk, we studied the expression patterns of stress-responsive genes , ion transporter genes  and antioxidant genes  in transgenic and nontransgenic arabidopsis thaliana. we examined the expression of these genes in three arabidopsis lines, including two genetically pure clones, k- <dig> and k- <dig>  which exhibited differences in stress resistance, and the nontransgenic line col- <dig>  the expression of all of the genes, except for ion transporter genes , was upregulated in transgenic gbrlk plants compared with col- <dig> plants, especially antioxidant genes , which exhibited higher levels of upregulation than other genes .

discussion
since rlks were first reported, many kinases that play important roles in plant responses to abiotic stress and the aba signaling network have been identified
 <cit> . we have identified a rlk gene, gbrlk from cotton. the deduced protein sequence analysis of this gene revealed the presence of high structural homology with rlk orthologs from other plants. the results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that gbrlk protein was clustered together with other reported receptor-like kinase proteins and displayed the close phylogenetic relationship with arabidopsis protein at5g <dig> and at4g <dig>  which up-regulated with drought treatment
 <cit> . this result indicated its potential function on abiotic stresses.

interestingly, we found the increased expression of gbrlk transcript was observed under aba, drought and high salt treatment, as shown by qrt-pcr, with highest early induction  found by aba, suggesting the stress responsive transcript accumulation of gbrlk in cotton. moreover gbrlk transcription was first transiently induced by aba, while transcription induced by nacl and drought treatment occurred later. in addition, aba treatment induced higher levels of upregulated gus expression than nacl or drought, with nacl producing the least upregulated gus expression. we therefore conclude that gbrlk is a member of the aba signal transduction pathway and activates aba signal transduction. drought or high-salt treatment increases aba levels, which in turn results in the up-regulation of gbrlk. meanwhile, overexpression of gbrlk can increase drought and high-salt tolerance in transgenic arabidopsis. these results indicate that this rlk gene from cotton may likely function as a component of a signaling pathway that confers tolerance to abiotic stresses. gbrlk may play an important role in abiotic stress responses and the aba signaling network.

aba plays an important role in the tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses. aba-independent and aba-dependent signal transduction cascades are involved in the inducible expression of specific genes by abiotic stresses
 <cit> . abre, myb and myc recognition sites function in aba-dependent pathways 38]. the analysis of the promoters of such aba-regulated genes has revealed a conserved cis-element, designated aba-responsive element , which controls aba-regulated gene expression
 <cit> . in the aba-independent pathway, gene expression in response to drought is regulated through dres/crt cis-acting elements or through nac recognition sites
 <cit> . based on the current study, the gbrlk promoter contains two abres and some myb and myc-core recognition sites and does not contain dres/crt cis-acting elements or an nac recognition site. moreover, the gbrlk promoter and the gbrlk gene can respond to aba, drought and high-salt stress. this study revealed a strong correlation between the inducibility of the gbrlk promoter and its internal cis-elements. for example, the w-box
 <cit>  and abre motifs
 <cit> , which are defense-responsive elements and cis-acting elements involved in abscisic acid responsiveness, may be the regulatory motifs of the gbrlk promoter that are responsible for the plant responses to the defense-related stimuli of v. dahliae and/or to aba, peg and nacl. this information, combined with the results of the present study, suggests that gbrlk may take part in the aba-dependent signaling pathway.

water loss in plants is caused by drought and high-salinity conditions. aba regulates stomatal opening in plants to avoid the affects of water loss due to drought and high salinity
 <cit> . in this study, the water loss rate of the transgenic lines was significantly lower than that of the wt control. thus, we can speculate that the improvement of resistance to drought and salt stresses may result from the aba signaling pathway activated by the grlk gene, which regulated other genes expression to decrease transpiration and water loss.

by contrast, the expression levels of two stress-responsive ion transporter genes, atnhx <dig> <cit>  and atsos <dig> <cit> , were not significantly different in transgenic and nontransgenic arabidopsis. in addition, gbrlk expression increased in response to verticillium dahliae infection
 <cit> . this pathogen promotes lignification of the cell wall, the formation of lignitubers and the restriction of vascular spread
 <cit> ; these responses not only prevent the pathogen from spreading further, but they also restrict water transport within the vascular system and alter the infected plant’s water balance or flux, causing severe dehydration stress. these results indicate that gbrlk is more highly induced by water deficit than by osmotic stress. therefore, the main effect of the overexpression of gbrlk is a reduction in the amount of water loss in drought- and high-salt-stressed plants.

the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of higher plants to drought and high-salt stress are complicated. in response to these stress factors, various genes are up-regulated, which can mitigate the effects of stress and lead to an adjustment of plant stress tolerance. rd <dig> is one of the most highly stress-responsive genes and is often used as a stress marker gene
 <cit> . rd <dig>  which encodes an nac protein, is induced by drought, high salinity and aba and is probably involved in a novel aba-dependent stress-signaling pathway
 <cit> . rd <dig> is another stress-responsive gene
 <cit> . in the current study, the increased expression of rd <dig>  rd <dig> and rd <dig> in gbrlk plants compared with wt plants further supports the hypothesis that gbrlk plays a role in dehydration-stress tolerance.

the generation of reactive oxygen species  is common component of plant responses to abiotic stress and aba
 <cit> . plants have evolved a complex antioxidant system to detoxify stress-induced ros, in which ros scavenging enzymes such as superoxide dismutase play essential roles
 <cit> . the increased expression of atcsd <dig> <cit> , atcsd <dig> <cit> , atccs and atcat <dig> <cit>  in gbrlk transgenic plants that was observed in the current study may have led to the scavenging of ros produced under drought stress. these observations have clearly demonstrated the indirect role that gbrlk plays in protecting plants from dehydration stress by scavenging oxygen radicals. this study further clarifies the role played by gbrlk in improving stress tolerance in plants by affecting different stress-related pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrates that the manipulation of a gbrlk gene from cotton using a transgenic approach can lead to improved high-salt and drought-stress tolerance in plants. we also obtained similar results by analyzing the promoter of the gbrlk gene. thus, we hypothesize that gbrlk activates or participate in the aba signaling pathway, and overexpression of gbrlk may improve stress tolerance by regulating stress-responsive genes to reduce the damage caused by water loss. the results of this study help clarify the role of gbrlk in improving stress tolerance in plants by affecting different stress-related pathways. the gbrlk gene will be a candidate gene for future research on abiotic stress signaling pathways and the genetic engineering of novel cotton cultivars.
