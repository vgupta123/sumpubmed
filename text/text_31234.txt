BACKGROUND
the genus silene  consists of several hundred species with a mainly holarctic distribution. because species vary widely in their breeding system, sex determination and ecology, the genus has historically played an important role in genetic and ecological studies dating back to mendel and darwin. more recently the genus has emerged as a model system in plant ecology, evolution, genetics and developmental biology  <cit> . however, a major limitation of using silene as model system is the near absence of genomic information pertaining to the genus. recently the first est library was published  <cit> , based on normalized cdna sequences derived from different reproductive tissues of the dioecious species silene latifolia. in s. latifolia, sex is determined by heteromorphic sex chromosomes. as in mammals, s. latifolia males are heterogametic  and females are homogametic . in contrast to the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes which evolved about  <dig> million years ago   <cit> , the age of s. latifolia sex chromosomes has been estimated to be about  <dig> my  <cit> . the overwhelming majority of silene species are however not dioecious and lack sex chromosomes. these species are either hermaphroditic or gynodioecious, such as in the case of the widely distributed bladder campion s. vulgaris. the relatively recent evolution of sex chromosomes in s. latifolia and the availability of closely related species without sex chromosomes, make the genus an ideal target for studying the evolution of sex chromosomes.

the closest relatives of s. latifolia are a group of dioecious species, including s. marizii and s. dioica, with which s. latifolia often hybridizes upon secondary contact  <cit> . the two species occupy different habitats  <cit>  and differ in flower color and odor  <cit> . as is frequently the case in pairs of closely related plant species where multiple barriers contribute to reproductive isolation  <cit> , reproductive isolation between s. dioica and s. latifolia is incomplete, and the occurrence of gene flow across species boundaries leads to porous genomes  <cit> . a recent population genomic analysis revealed that neutral processes, introgression and adaptive divergence shape species differences  <cit> . however, the extent to which genes underlying floral trait or habitat differences contribute to adaptive divergence has never been investigated. a major hindrance to investigate the genetic causes of adaptive divergence is that the silene genome remains largely unexplored. the present study tackles this problem by comparative high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of silene latifolia, s. dioica, s. marizii, s. vulgaris and dianthus superbus. the sequences generated in this study are annotated and publicly available through siesta, the silene est annotation database http://www.siesta.ethz.ch.

silene and dianthus species vary greatly in genome size and have different haploid chromosome numbers . with a haploid genome size of about  <dig>  mbp  <cit> , the s. latifolia genome is similar in size to corn   <cit> . in contrast, the genome size of s. vulgaris   <cit>  is less than half that of s. latifolia and some dianthus species have even smaller genomes   <cit> . thus, genome sizes differ by a factor of two between dianthus and s. vulgaris and by a factor of four between dianthus and s. latifolia.

to further develop genomic resources for the genus silene, and especially for the dioecious species related to s. latifolia, we performed comparative high-throughput transcriptome sequencing using  <dig> pyrosequencing technology. this method is increasingly used for est sequencing in both animals  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . advantages over conventional sanger sequencing based est projects are the large amount of data generated per run and the fact that cloning is not required as an initial step, factors which substantially reduce the time, labor and cost involved  <cit> .

here we present the results of comparative transcriptome sequencing in seven silene individuals representing four species, and one dianthus outgroup. these species are closely related and include species with and without sex chromosomes, also differing substantially in genome size. a total of  <dig> , <dig> est reads, totaling  <dig> , <dig> bp, were obtained from two complete  <dig> pyrosequencing runs and processed and assembled in the siesta database. these ests provide a unique and novel resource for ecological and evolutionary studies in silene and dianthus.

RESULTS
siesta database characteristics
 <dig> pyrosequencing of eight individual cdna libraries derived from one silene latifolia male  and two females , one s. dioica male  and female , one s. marizii male , and one individual of the each of the hermaphroditic species s. vulgaris  and dianthus superbus  lead to a total of  <dig> , <dig> est reads. the number of nucleotides sequenced per library varied between  <dig> million and  <dig> million in slff and ds respectively . in contrast to studies using normalized libraries  <cit> , we used non-normalized libraries with the advantage of searches not identifying weakly expressed genes and a reduced chance of finding alternative splicing variants  <cit> . however, these factors may negatively impact upon the ability to build contigs. our reads were assembled into  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons , with an overall total of  <dig>  unigenes  that were deposited in a newly developed database called siesta  . all reads may be accessed under the accession number erp <dig> in the ncbi sequence read archive and all contigs are available in genbank transcriptome shotgun assembly  under the accession numbers jl <dig> - jl <dig>  the unigenes were sorted into eight individual libraries with an average size of  <dig>  ests and  <dig>  contigs per library. two super-libraries, supsl and supsd, containing the sequences of s. latifolia and s. dioica individuals, respectively, were also created. their sizes are  <dig>  and  <dig>  superunigenes respectively.

 units in thousands of sequences.

as reported elsewhere in recent studies  <cit>  short est reads from  <dig> sequencing runs may be assembled and annotated to effectively characterize the gene space of non-model organisms. average read length in our study was  <dig> bp, close to the lengths obtained in other recent studies that used the gs-flx platform for sequencing  <cit> , but substantially longer than early studies that used the gs- <dig> platform where read lengths were  <dig> to  <dig> bp  <cit> . between 47% and 91% of est reads were assembled into contigs , while the remainder were kept as singletons . similar percentages of reads assembled into contigs were found in other studies, ranging from 40% to 48%  <cit>  to 88% and 90%  <cit>  in both plants and animals. the frequency distribution of ests per unigene showed a hyperbolic distribution , with a single est read available for most unigenes , whereas only a small proportion of unigenes include a large number of est reads. given that our libraries were not normalized, one can use the number of ests per unigene as an estimate of expression level  <cit> . this implies that the unigenes composed of many est reads are highly expressed. an analysis of the ten most strongly expressed genes  in each library revealed that these correspond to only fifteen different genes . of these, two were found in more than four out of the eight libraries analyzed. our results indicate that one of these genes codes for an alpha-tubulin homologue of arabidopsis thaliana  and the second for a homologue of a predicted orf in pinus koraiensis  . most of these genes are housekeeping genes that are known to be highly expressed  <cit> .

go annotations revealed that a large number of contigs had a term assigned to them. of the  <dig>  contigs tested ,  <dig>  were annotated with a go term. the large number of go terms annotated in the libraries  further confirms the quality of the contigs of our database.

a comparison of the ten most represented go annotations reveals substantial homogeneity in the composition of our libraries .

in addition, the analysis of the ten most represented gene groups, based on the most expressed go slim for plants  <cit> , confirmed the homogeneity of gene expression in the buds of the different species studied . not surprisingly, genes involved in cellular component organization translation and transcription are highly expressed in all our individuals.

. for each library, the expression percentage is calculated as the number of reads included in contigs matching a term divided by the total number of reads included in all contigs. terms are sorted by the total expression common to all libraries in descending order.

ninety-nine percent of the unigenes have an orf predicted by prot4est . about 45% of the predictions are based on blast similarities, 28% are predicted by estscan and the remaining 27% correspond to the longest reading frames of the sequences.

the silene genome is known to include a large number of repeated elements  <cit>  and we had to filter out such elements because they contribute to assembly problems. on average,  <dig>  reads per library matched repeated elements . numerous repeated elements have recently been identified in s. latifolia  <cit> , which make easier contig construction even a large diversity of elements still remains to be characterized.

our newly developed est resources for silene and dianthus, with  <dig>  ests on average, are comparable to the resources available for helianthus annuus  and for populus trichocarpa  .

the siesta database
the newly developed siesta database provides several tools that facilitate data and information extraction. the first tool is the unigene search engine , which allows to enter a list of unigene or superunigene names. from these, the user directly obtains the link to the sequence annotations and can download all sequences in fasta format. the second tab called "libraries" allows users to navigate the database. information about the different libraries, including species identity and tissue used, sex of the individual and the total number of unigenes/superunigenes in the library are presented in a table. by selecting the link on the unigene number, the user may download the complete set of unigenes from each library. the link attached to the library name enables the user to access the unigene table which lists unigenes, their lengths, the number of ests per unigene and the best hit with uniprot. selecting any unigene provides access to the unigene sequence, a picture of the est alignment that is linked to the alignment in fasta format and a table with the five best hits with the a. thaliana proteome and uniprot. in the case of superunigenes, additional information is available, including orf prediction and the list of unigenes that are part of the superunigene. the third tool, "query", allows users to search for genes using their annotations. the fourth tab provides a link to a gene onthology formatted browser interface from which it is possible to obtain go annotation for contigs of each species included in siesta. the fifth tool is a blast search engine that allows users to search for nucleic or protein sequence homology within the eight siesta libraries using blastn, tblastx or tblastn searches. the sixth and seventh tabs "tools" and "faq" provide all this information on the web-site.

homology with plant model species
in order to annotate and evaluate the quality of our reads and of our assemblies, we performed blastx searches to align both contigs and singletons from each library with a. thaliana, vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa proteomes and uniprot . on average, 49% of the contigs and 27% of the singletons had a significant hit to the a. thaliana proteome. we evaluated the redundancy of the hits and found that on average 32% and 18% of contigs and singletons respectively match strictly different a. thaliana protein sequence. these non-redundant protein sequences  revealed that some of our unigenes could come from distinct regions of the same gene. compared to the proportions of hits with a. thaliana, we noticed an increase of the average percentage of matches for both contigs and singletons respectively, with v. vinifera , p. trichocarpa  and with uniprot . nevertheless, even though most of the silene genes have a match with the three model species, across all libraries, an average of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hits are exclusive to the proteomes of a. thaliana, v. vinifera or p. trichocarpa, respectively . such differences among the investigated proteomes might suggest that p. trichocarpa is more closely related to silene than a. thaliana and v. vinifera. however, the phylogeny of angiosperms compiled by bremer and coworkers  <cit>  reveals that silene  is phylogenetically equally distant from vitis , populus  and arabidopsis . the causes of these observed differences are currently unknown, but a possible explanation may be differential gene loss during the evolution of these plant lineages as observed in other plants  <cit> .

in the second column are numbers of contigs with hits occurring in all three species; the following columns give the numbers of contigs with hits exclusively to a. thaliana   , v. vinifera   and p. trichocarpa  .

contigs lacking known homologs
for  <dig>  contigs out of the  <dig>  contigs assembled in the present study, homologous genes could not be identified through blast searches against several databases . of these  <dig>  contigs,  <dig>  were found only in a single library, whereas  <dig>  contigs correspond to sequences found in more than one library. after removing redundancies,  <dig>  unigenes remained that had no significant hit in blastx searches against uniprot and were found in at least two libraries. a substantial proportion of these unigenes  had similarities with additional repeated elements identified from s. latifolia  and were removed. the remaining  <dig>  contigs were compared with the est library reported by moccia et al.  <cit> , and 14% of these contigs had a significant hit. for some of the corresponding ests of moccia et al.  <cit>  there is a significant hit with uniprot, most likely because these sequences were longer and contained coding sequences, and we were able to infer homology for  <dig> contigs. after removing one further transposon homologue and  <dig> sequences consisting of utr regions, only  <dig> sequences had a good homology with gene coding regions, but  <dig> of them had undetermined functions. of the remaining contigs,  <dig>  sequences looked like potential caryophyllaceae-specific genes . yang and coworkers  <cit>  recently investigated species-specific genes in the a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and oryza sativa proteomes. inter-proteome comparisons revealed that  <dig> of  <dig>  proteins  are exclusive to a. thaliana, as these proteins have no homologue in either p. trichocarpa or o. sativa and also in carica, glycine, medicago, sorghum, vitis and zea . similarly, we searched our libraries for genes that are specific for silene or dianthus. we have identified  <dig>  sequences from our studied species that may correspond to caryophyllaceae-specific genes. these sequences represent about  <dig> % of all contigs. the proportions of species-specific proteins identified by yang et al.  <cit>  in a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and o. sativa are  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively. our estimate is also less than 2%, but we do not have a sequenced genome available, and consequently, some genes are certainly missing in the calculation and some may have been counted more than once. possible biases introduced in our estimates include that 1) we used contigs built from cdna sequences. these are different from full-length protein sequences because they are oftentimes only fragments of coding sequences and it is possible that different contigs contain non-overlapping regions of the same gene as revealed by table  <dig>  2) singletons were not included in this analysis because their quantity prevented computation. 3) the lack of well-annotated genome sequences of species closely related to silene reduced chances to find more homologous sequences. 4) our est libraries were non-normalized, and it is thus possible that further caryophyllaceae-specific genes were missed because they were not sufficiently expressed to be represented in our database. points  <dig> and  <dig> might increase the proportion of caryophyllaceae-specific genes while points  <dig> and  <dig> might decrease it. further studies will reveal whether these sequences are indeed specific to silene and what their functions are. for this purpose, our siesta database provides a valuable resource.

snp detection, validation and heterozygosity estimates
qualitysnp predicted between  <dig>  and  <dig>  polymorphic sites in our eight libraries, the results of snp analysis for each individual library being presented in table  <dig>  there are on average  <dig> snps per  <dig>  bp of expressed sequences in silene and dianthus and most snps are substitutions .

* only contigs assembled from at least  <dig> reads were considered. the total length of these contigs was used to calculate the percentage of heterozygous positions. all snps that are not due to substitutions are indels.

of the  <dig> polymorphic positions predicted by qualitysnp that were selected for validation,  <dig>  of snps were confirmed by sanger sequencing of pcr products. polymorphic positions that are not associated with single-nucleotide repeats were selected for validation, because pyrosequencing is known to experience difficulties in sequencing these regions  <cit> . we observed that such regions often induce incorrect predictions of snps by qualitysnp. from our snp data we cannot directly estimate nucleotide diversity, because our snp estimates are based on reads from single individuals. however, the detected polymorphisms allow estimating heterozygosity in the different species. polymorphism varies between  <dig> and  <dig> snps per  <dig> kb of expressed sequences for slf and slff respectively . similar values were reported in maize  <cit> , with between  <dig> and  <dig> snps per  <dig> kb, in oryza sativa  <cit> , with around  <dig> snps per  <dig> kb, and in a. thaliana  <cit> , with around  <dig> snps per  <dig> kb. by analyzing  <dig> genes in silene latifolia, a recent study estimated a polymorphism rate of about  <dig> snps per  <dig> kb  <cit> , which is ten times higher than in other plants. the origin and the large number of individuals sampled in that study is probably the reason for these high estimates. our results suggested that there is no difference in the proportion of heterozygous positions between the dioecious species and the gynodioecious species in the genus silene . however, a lower level of heterozygosity was detected in the s. latifolia female library slf  compared to other libraries. sif belongs to an inbred line, which explains the low polymorphism exhibited by this individual. on the contrary, an increase of polymorphism was detected in the f <dig> individual slff, which was obtained by crossing the two other s. latifolia plants, slm and slf. polymorphisms detected in this individual provide valuable markers for the development of a linkage map for s. latifolia and its sex chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
the high quality est database siesta provides valuable resources for molecular ecologists studying caryophyllaceae, particularly for the genus silene. it provides the necessary molecular resources to develop microsatellite and snp markers for linkage mapping and population genetic analyses, provides access to candidate genes for specific traits, such as heavy metal tolerance or flower color variation, and enables identification of × and y-linked gene copies. moreover this online database http://www.siesta.ethz.ch provides access to sequences and annotations of four silene and one dianthus species lacking fully-sequenced genomes. the two  <dig> sequencing runs described in this study generated more than one million sequencing reads, allowing for the identification of about  <dig>  genes and about  <dig>  snps. we hope that the availability of these resources will encourage further investigations into the genomics and evolutionary biology of silene and related species.
