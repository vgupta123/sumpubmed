BACKGROUND
polyhydroxyalkanoates  are bacterial storage compounds produced widely by many microorganisms under nutrient limited growth conditions such as a nitrogen, phosphorous or oxygen starvation and when an excess of carbon source is present
 <cit> . phas gained particular interest because they were shown to be biodegradable and biocompatible . based on the chain length of the fatty acid monomers, phas can be classified into three categories: short-chain-length  phas with  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms, medium-chain-length  phas with  <dig> to  <dig> carbon atoms and long-chain-length  phas with more than  <dig> carbon atoms
 <cit> . the difference in length and/or chemical structure of the alkyl side chain of the phas influences the material properties of the polymers to a great extent. the production of tailor-made mcl-phas enables to obtain the desired material properties using the appropriate fatty acid precursor. phas have been considered as an attractive ecofriendly alternative to petrochemical polymers. however, the much higher production cost compared with conventional petrochemical derived polymers has limited their widespread use.

much effort has been devoted to reduce the price of phas by developing better bacterial strains, more efficient fermentation and/or more economical recovery processes
 <cit> . it has been shown that the cost of raw materials  contributes most significantly to the overall production cost of phas 
 <cit> . the use of two kinds of carbon sources can be an attractive approach to reduce cost: the first carbon substrate is used for cell growth to obtain biomass, while the second one  allows the synthesis of pha. the substrate for bacterial growth should be inexpensive and abundant. xylose is second only to glucose in natural abundance
 <cit> . thus, it is a promising candidate substrate for bacterial growth.

d-xylose is the dominant building unit of the hemicelluloses in plants of all species of the gramineae. hemicellulose, the third most abundant polymer in nature, can be easily hydrolyzed into fermentable sugars by either chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis
 <cit> . in some plants, xylan comprises up to 40% of the total dry material. annually,  <dig> billion tons of hemicelluloses are produced and remain almost completely unused
 <cit> . it has been reported that the hemicellulose hydrolysate including xylose can be used by candida blankii for efficient protein production
 <cit> . there are also reports that poly  could be synthesized from xylose in pseudomonas pseudoflava and p. cepacia up to 22%  and 50% , respectively
 <cit> . furthermore, escherichia coli harboring pha synthesis genes of ralstonia eutropha was reported to be able to accumulate phb from xylose up to 74% w w - <dig> with a yield of  <dig>  g phb per g xylose
 <cit> .

up to now, no report has been published on the production of mcl-pha by using xylose. since mcl-phas offer different material properties compared to scl-phas, it would be interesting to investigate whether mcl-phas can be obtained from xylose. pseudomonas putida kt <dig>  whose genome sequence is available , is one of the best-characterized pseudomonads for mcl-pha production
 <cit> . it is able to synthesize and accumulate large amounts  of mcl-phas
 <cit> , but can only ferment a narrow range of sugars, in which xylose is not included. it has been shown that an engineered strain of p. putida s <dig> can utilize d-xylose and l-arabinose
 <cit> . introducing xyla  and xylb  from e. coli into p. putida s <dig> enabled the latter to utilize xylose as the sole carbon source.

in this study, the possibility of using xylose as a growth carbon source and octanoic acid as mcl-pha precusor in the controlled production of mcl-pha by recombinant p. putida kt <dig> was examined. the xylab genes from e. coli w <dig> were cloned into p. putida kt <dig> and the obtained recombinant was studied for its ability to grow on xylose. for mcl-pha production a sequential feeding strategy of using xylose and fatty acids was applied.

RESULTS
cloning and expression of the xyla and xylb genes encoding xylose isomerase and xylulokinase
to clone the xylab genes, which are organized in an operon, of e. coli w <dig>  dna primers pfxyla <dig> and prxylb were designed based on the genomic sequence of e. coli w <dig> . these primers were used to amplify the xylab fragment by pcr with w <dig> chromosomal dna as the template, leading to a  <dig>  kb dna product . the pcr product was inserted into the shuttle vector pvlt <dig> as described in methods, resulting in pslm <dig> plasmid. p. putida kt <dig>  was grown on e <dig> minimal medium with either  <dig> g l- <dig> xylose or glucose, leading to a c/n ratio of  <dig> g g - <dig>  p. putida kt <dig>  was used as a control.

when grown on glucose, kt <dig>  exhibited a higher maximal specific growth rate  than kt <dig>   . due to nitrogen limitation both kt <dig>  and kt <dig>  exhibited reduced growth rate after  <dig> h, with the latter having a dramatic reduction . the difference in the degree of the reduction in growth rate could be partially caused by the different pha content in kt <dig>   and kt <dig>  . the different pha content was also reflexed by the different maximum od <dig> values reached by kt <dig>   and kt <dig>   . when xylose was used as the sole carbon source, kt <dig>  was not able to grow during the entire test period , whereas the recombinant kt <dig>  exhibited a typical bacterial growth curve . the maximum specific growth rate of the iptg-induced recombinant kt <dig>  culture was similar to the culture without induction, of μ =  <dig>  h- <dig> and μ =  <dig>  h- <dig>  respectively. this demonstrates that the expression of xylab from pslm <dig> is not tightly regulated and xylab can be expressed even without the induction by iptg. the recombinant kt <dig>  reached a maximal od <dig> value of  <dig>  on xylose. in all experiments the carbon substrate  was not totally consumed at the end of the cultivation, around  <dig> g l- <dig> was left over in the culture broth.

these results suggest that the cloned xylab from e. coli are functionally expressed in p. putida kt <dig>  and xylab alone are sufficient to allow the growth of kt <dig> on xylose. to have better controlled growth, further experiments were performed in bioreactors.

growth of p. putida kt <dig>  on xylose in the bioreactor
p. putida kt <dig>  was grown on e <dig> medium with  <dig> g l- <dig> xylose in a  <dig>  l laboratory bioreactor. figure
 <dig> shows that the kt <dig>  cells utilized xylose as the sole carbon source with a maximum specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig>  the growth stopped due to nitrogen limitation after  <dig> h of cultivation. afterwards the biomass increased only slightly from  <dig>  g l- <dig> to maximum  <dig>  g l- <dig> at  <dig> h. even though nitrogen-limitation was reached, xylose was further consumed and finally only a tiny amount was left in the medium . the biomass yield from xylose was about  <dig>  g g- <dig> upon nitrogen limitation , and about  <dig>  g g- <dig> upon the xylose depletion. the consumed xylose after nitrogen completion may have been used for cell maintenance and/or by-products such as acetic acid. indeed, large amounts of acetic acid were detected from the beginning of the growth, in the range of several hundred milligrams per liter. the culture was also assayed for pha content at different time points. only trace amounts  of pha were detected using xylose as the sole carbon source, which enables to use xylose as growth substrate for the production of tailor-made mcl-phas.

to confirm the enzymatic activities of xyla and xylb, cells were harvested at the early exponential growth phase . samples without substrates and samples without cell-free extracts were used as negative controls, while e. coli w <dig> cells grown on e <dig> with xylose were used as the positive control. the specific activities of xylose isomerase and xylulokinase measured in p. putida kt <dig>  were  <dig>  u and  <dig>  u, respectively, whereas no significant activites were observed in the negative controls . the activities obtained here were in the same range as those found in wild-type e. coli w <dig> . these results confirmed that both xyla and xylb were active in p. putida kt <dig>  the enzymatic activities of xyla and xylb were also found for the non-induced cultures, thus, induction by iptg is not needed for the expression of xyla and xylb genes and was therefore omitted in the following experiments.

pha production in kt <dig>  by sequential-feeding of xylose and fatty acid
nitrogen limitation is known to promote pha accumulation
 <cit> . it has been demonstrated that nitrogen limitation can lead to a strong induction of phag encoding a transacylase, resulting in mcl-pha accumulation from carbohydrate in p. putida kt2440
 <cit> . thus, in the experiments performed in mini-reactors the amount of nitrogen present in e <dig> medium was decreased to 20%  to obtain the best conditions for mcl-pha accumulation. as expected, kt <dig>  did not show any growth on xylose , similar as observed in figure
 <dig>  kt <dig>  exhibited a maximal specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> on xylose with a maximum od <dig> of  <dig>  . no pha was detected for kt <dig>  on xylose.

the cells were grown in  <dig> ne <dig> minimal media supplemented with different carbon sources in  <dig> l mini-bioreactors with a working volume of  <dig> ml. samples were taken regularly to measure growth, nitrogen concentration, carbon source present in the medium and pha contents. data points are the averages of duplicate measurements.

to test whether the recombinant is able to accumulate mcl-pha from related carbon source , kt <dig>  was pre-cultured in e <dig> minimal medium with xylose as the sole carbon source and then transferred into a bioreactor containing  <dig> ne <dig> medium with  <dig> mm octanoic acid as the sole carbon source . samples were taken regularly and the cellular pha content was determined. it was found that kt <dig>  was able to accumulate mcl-pha to 21%  after  <dig> h of cultivation.

the above results demonstrate that the recombinant strain kt <dig>  kept the ability to synthesize pha from fatty acids, but could not do so from xylose. this allows sequential feeding of xylose and fatty acids to obtain tailor-made mcl-pha biosynthesis, namely, first using an inexpensive carbon source for cell growth and then adding the appropriate mcl-pha precursor to allow the polymer accumulation. the sequential feeding strategy enables production of a tailor-made mcl-pha according to the supplied fatty acid. octanoic acid was tested here as mcl-pha precursor in order to obtain poly accumulation. we first investigated the influence of linear feeding of octanoic acid at different growth stages on pha synthesis. four minireactors in parallel were inoculated using the same p. putida kt <dig>  preculture grown in e <dig> medium with  <dig>  g l- <dig> xylose. in cultures d and e linear feeding of  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> of octanoic acid was initiated at od <dig> of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. both cultures showed a similar maximum specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> . the nitrogen limitation was reached after  <dig> h and xylose was depleted after  <dig> h for both cultures. the maximum accumulation of pha was found to be  <dig> % w w- <dig> and  <dig> % w w- <dig> for d and e, respectively, after about  <dig> h of cultivation . the obtained results suggested that pha can be produced in p. putida kt <dig>  by sequential feeding of xylose and fatty acids. the exponential phase ended at od <dig> of  <dig>  due to nitrogen limitation. linear feeding at the end of the exponential growth phase in the batch  gave a better yield of pha compared to that at the mid-exponential growth phase . this lower yield obtained in the latter can be explained by consumption of octanoic acid for growth rather than for pha accumulation during the mid-exponential phase.

to increase pha accumulation, the feeding rate was increased from  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> to  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> of octanoic acid. culture f was grown on  <dig> ne <dig> with  <dig>  g l- <dig> xylose and feeding started at the end of the exponential growth phase with a feeding rate of  <dig>  g l- <dig> h- <dig> of octanoic acid. for comparison, culture g was supplemented with  <dig>  g l- <dig> xylose and  <dig>  g l- <dig> octanoic acid from the beginning on . using culture f as an example, figure
 <dig> represents a typical behavior of cells regarding growth and pha synthesis. after  <dig> h and  <dig>  h of cultivation, nitrogen and xylose were depleted, respectively. when cells entered the nitrogen limitation phase a linear feeding of octanoic acid was started for  <dig> h and then stopped. pha synthesis was detected after  <dig> h of feeding and increased linearly to  <dig> % w w- <dig> during the following  <dig> h. only a slight increase of pha content to about 20% w w- <dig> was found after further incubation up to  <dig> h. the concentration of octanoic acid measured in the culture increased with feeding time, after  <dig>  h from the beginning of the feeding about  <dig>  g l- <dig> octanoic acid was detected; afterwards it continuously decreased. at the end of the cultivation, after  <dig>  h, the remaining octanoic acid was only  <dig>  g l- <dig>  a maximal yield of mcl-pha from octanoic acid of  <dig>  g mcl-pha g- <dig> octanoic acid was obtained by considering the increase of pha from  <dig> % w w- <dig> to 20% w w- <dig> in relation to the consumption of octanoic acid from  <dig>  g l- <dig> to  <dig>  g l- <dig> 

gc analysis revealed that the main monomer component of the synthesized pha was 3-hydroxyoctanoate  and no 3-hydroxydecanoate was detected. these results confirm that the detected pha is mainly from octanoic acid. since the main monomer unit of pha produced from carbohydrates is 3-hydroxydecanoate in kt2440
 <cit> , it is very unlikely that xylose was used for pha synthesis. the sequential feeding strategy using xylose as growth substrate and octanoic acid as mcl-pha precursor enabled production of a controlled mcl-pha production.

discussion
growth of kt <dig> on xylose
a recombinant p. putida kt <dig> strain was constructed that could efficiently utilize xylose. the introduction of xylose isomerase  and xylulokinase  was essential and sufficient for the utilization of xylose and a growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> was routinely obtained. previously, it has been reported that a so called “laboratory evolution” was necessary to improve the growth rate of p. putida s <dig>  on xylose from  <dig>  h- <dig> to  <dig>  h- <dig> and to obtain a yield of  <dig>  g cdw per g xylose
 <cit> . the laboratory evolution is an adoption process by growing the cells consecutively in a fresh medium containing the unfavorable carbon source. the “laboratory evolution” was not needed for the kt <dig> recombinant to grow on xylose. this difference could be attributed to the different physiological background/metabolic fluxes of kt <dig> and s <dig>  it has been reported that in p. putida a complete pentose phosphate pathway is present
 <cit>   as well as the key enzymes for mcl-pha accumulation
 <cit> . our study demonstrated that the enzymes responsible for converting xylose to the entry intermediate xylulose-5-phosphate of pp pathway are missing in p. putida. by introducing the relevant enzymes xyla and xylb, p. putida kt <dig> was able to utilize xylose.

in addition, the recombinant p. putida kt <dig> appeared to have an efficient xylose uptake system. similarly, p. putida s <dig> carrying d-xylonate dehydratase has been reported to grow on xylose without expressing any xylose transporter
 <cit> . since pentose and hexose transporters have been shown to be promiscuous
 <cit> , it is possible that xylose uptake can be accomplished by glucose uptake systems in strain kt <dig> . many bacteria also possess non-specific transporters. indeed, many sugars are transported into e. coli by phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase systems  like glucose, mannose, fructose, and n-acetylglucosamine
 <cit> . in this study, no specific xylose transporters such as xyle or xylfgh were needed for growth of kt <dig>  on xylose. thus, it is also possible that xylose entered the cell through the pts system present in p. putida in a similar way as reported for fructose
 <cit> . xylose, after uptake into the cell, is isomerized by xylose isomerase to xylulose, which is then converted by xylulokinase to xylulose 5-phosphate. this phosphorylated derivate is then catabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway. in comparison to growth on glucose, the growth of p. putida kt <dig>  on xylose exhibited a similar specific growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> . this demonstrated that the uptake and the catabolic rate of xylose by the recombinant p. putida kt <dig>  is in the same range as that of glucose.

pha production by sequential feeding
the biosynthesis of mcl-pha is mainly studied for fluorescent pseudomonads, e.g. p. putida kt <dig>  strain kt <dig> is characterized by a wide metabolic and physiologic versatility and is able to accumulate mcl-pha from glucose
 <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that mcl-pha biosynthesis on xylose does not occur when xyla and xylb are expressed even under nitrogen limitation, perhaps because the expression of xylab channels the metabolic flux to central metabolism such as tca cycle for cell maintenance or/and to production of side products like acetate, rather than to pha synthesis .

up to now, there has been no report on mcl-pha production by using xylose as the growth substrate. substrate cost make up a large proportion of the total production cost of pha. fatty acids are generally much more expensive than lignocellulose hydrolysates  and often toxic to the cells at relatively low concentrations and, for some of them, do not support fast growth rates. xylose is in a similar price range like cane molasses and half the price of glucose
 <cit> , consequently, sequential-feeding strategies are a valid option to reduce the production cost
 <cit> . sequential-feeding consists of using on one hand cheap carbohydrates for achieving a large biomass and on the other hand fatty acids as mcl-pha precursors to produce tailor-made mcl-phas.

in this study, xylose was used for cell growth in the first step, and then octanoate was supplied to synthesize mcl-pha in the second step under nitrogen limitation. this sequential feeding process allowed a tailor-made mcl-pha accumulation of up to 20%  under not-yet-optimized conditions. when  <dig>  g l- <dig> octanoate was employed alone for growth and pha production , lower pha content  was obtained than that from using both xylose and  <dig>  g l- <dig> octanoate , even though the growth rate and the final cell density reached in entry c were higher than those in entry g. these results suggest that xylose is not a substrate as good as octanoate for growth of kt <dig>  however, it can facilitate the pha production by being a substrate for growth and allowing only octanoate to be converted to pha.

in this study, p. putida kt <dig>  showed a biomass yield from xylose at  <dig>  g g- <dig>  which is similar to what has been previously reported  <dig>  g g- <dig> for p. putida s <dig> 
 <cit> . previously, kim and co-workers used a sequential feeding strategy to maximize the pha production in p. putida using glucose as growth substrate and then octanoic acid for pha accumulation
 <cit> . a yield of  <dig>  g mcl-pha g- <dig> octanoic acid was reached
 <cit> , similar to the yield of  <dig>  g mcl-pha g- <dig> octanoic acid obtained in this study by sequential feeding of xylose and octanoic acid. however, it has also been reported that the yield of mcl-phas from fatty acids such as nonanoic acid could achieve  <dig>  to  <dig>  g− <dig> mcl-pha g nonanoic acid by co-feeding glucose
 <cit> . therefore, further optimization of the sequential-feeding process is needed to increase the yield of tailor-made mcl-phas.

CONCLUSIONS
introduction of xylab from e. coli into p. putida kt <dig> was sufficient to allow the recombinant to efficiently utilize xylose as the sole carbon source. experiments performed in bioreactors showed that xyla and xylb were active in p. putida kt <dig>  the recombinant did not produce mcl-pha from xylose, thus enabled production of a tailor-made mcl-pha of up to 20%  by sequential-feeding of xylose and octanoate. a maximal yield of  <dig>  g mcl-pha g- <dig> octanoic acid was obtained with pha containing mainly 3-hydroxyoctanoate monomers . sequential feeding of relatively cheap carbohydrates and expensive fatty acids is a practical way to achieve more cost-effective mcl-pha production. optimization of initiation, rate and duration of feeding should be performed to achieve a higher yield and higher productivity of mcl-pha. furthermore, an optimized growth conditions will undoubtedly contribute to the economic feasibility of mcl-pha production from renewable feedstock.
