BACKGROUND
alzheimer's disease  is the most common form of dementia, and results in a progressive, irreversible decline in memory and cognitive function. one of the pathological hallmarks of the alzheimer's brain is the presence of aggregated amyloid beta  peptide in extracellular proteinaceous deposits in the parenchyma , and cerebral blood vessels  <cit> . aβ species with different amino- and carboxyl-termini are constitutively produced from the amyloid β precursor protein  through sequential proteolysis by β- and γ-secretases  <cit> . in most cases, a  <dig> amino acid form of aβ  is the major secreted product of these cleavages. the  <dig> amino acid form of aβ , although secreted at much lower levels than aβ <dig>  has been implicated as the initiating molecule in the pathogenesis of ad  <cit> .

aβ <dig> is more amyloidogenic than aβ <dig>  and is deposited earlier and more consistently than aβ <dig> in the ad brain parenchyma. significantly, mutations in presenilin  <dig> , presenilin  <dig> , and app genes linked to early onset genetic forms of ad perturb aβ peptide levels or in rare cases directly alter the aβ sequence in a way that increase the propensity of the mutant aβ to aggregate and form fibrils. the vast majority of these ad-linked mutations selectively increase the relative levels of aβ <dig> peptides . small shifts in aβ <dig> production have a tremendous impact on the development of ad. in humans, ad-causing mutations in app and ps elevate plasma aβ <dig> levels by 30%–100%, and are associated with the onset of dementia in the 3rd to 5th decade of life  <cit> . studies of these same mutations in transgenic mice also demonstrate that small increases in aβ <dig> levels markedly accelerate aβ deposition in the brain and associated pathologies  <cit> . more recent studies in transgenic mice and drosophila selectively expressing aβ <dig> and aβ <dig> in the secretory pathway, demonstrates that aβ <dig> but not aβ <dig> is sufficient to drive aβ deposition, and, at least in drosophila, neurodegeneration  <cit> .

although numerous lines of evidence support a role for aβ <dig> in the underlying pathogenesis of ad, no therapies in clinical use target this molecule. the only currently approved treatments for ad are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  and the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, memantine  <cit> . these pharmacologic therapies are thought to improve cognition by targeting specific symptoms of the disease, such as reduced cholinergic neurotransmission and increased glutamatergic activity leading to excess activation of nmda receptors, respectively, without significantly modifying the underlying disease pathology  <cit> . despite only modest symptomatic benefit, cholinesterase inhibitors have been widely adopted for clinical use in the early stages of ad, whereas memantine has shown benefit in the moderate to severe stages of the disease  <cit> . given the growing ad epidemic there is an urgent need to discover alternative, more effective, therapies that not only target the disease symptoms but can also slow or halt the underlying neurodegenerative process. several novel therapies based on the current understanding of ad pathogenesis are being clinically evaluated, including the use of anti-inflammatories  <cit> .

over the past  <dig> years, a substantial number of epidemiological reports have shown that long-term use of non-aspirin, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs  is associated with protection from the development of ad  <cit> . this data has been used to support the hypothesis that anti-inflammatory drugs may be effective in slowing the progression of disease, since a robust cns inflammatory response is another prevalent feature of ad  <cit> . indeed, the epidemiologic data has been used as the primary rationale for previous and ongoing trials of select nsaids in ad  <cit> .

results from these trials have been mixed. clinical data from one double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that indomethacin may improve cognition in dementia  <cit> , but the results from this study were confounded by the lack of power and high drop-out rate due to adverse effects of the drug. a prospective, 25-week, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of diclofenac in combination with misoprostol in patients with mild to moderate ad in a prospective, 25-week trial, did not demonstrate a significant effect of nsaid treatment  <cit> . a more recent randomized, placebo-controlled 1-year clinical trial of naproxen or rofecoxib failed to detect any effect on cognitive impairment by naproxen or rofecoxib administration in mild to moderate ad patients  <cit> . finally, because of concerns over side-effects, a large prevention study  of naproxen and celecoxib was recently halted  <cit> .

there are a number of possible reasons for the varying results from these trials, and one potential explanation comes from studies which suggest that the general anti-inflammatory activity of nsaids may play a secondary role in modulating the development of aβ pathology while other pathways are involved  <cit> . first, chronic administration of only certain nsaids in mice has been reported to reduce aβ deposition. ibuprofen treatment was shown to significantly reduce amyloid pathology, neuritic dystrophy, plaque-associated gliosis and il- <dig> expression in tg <dig> transgenic mice  <cit> . after  <dig> months of treatment, amyloid plaque numbers and aβ levels in brain were reduced almost 50% and 40%, respectively. in the same study, naproxen treatment was not effective. this result suggests that cyclooxygenase  inhibition, the main target of nsaids, per se, is not driving reductions in aβ deposition. furthermore, two nitric oxide-releasing derivates of flurbiprofen  and indomethacin have also been shown to reduce amyloid pathology following long-term administration to aβ-depositing mice  <cit> .

in contrast, nimesulide and celecoxib have been reported to have no effect on aβ plaque pathology, further suggesting that cox  <dig> or  <dig> inhibition is not sufficient to decrease aβ deposition  <cit> . these results provide additional evidence that only certain nsaids are able to suppress aβ aggregation in the brain and that these compounds may be targeting a unique pathway.

one possible explanation for these observations is the discovery that certain nsaids, such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and the enantiomer of flurbiprofen are capable of lowering the production of aβ <dig> selectively  <cit> . in contrast, certain cox- <dig> inhibitors selectively raise aβ <dig> or have no effect  <cit> . the ability of these compounds to modulate aβ <dig> levels is independent of cox and other previously identified targets of these drugs, such as nfκb  <cit> . although the mechanism of aβ modulation has not been definitively established, experimental evidence suggests that these compounds target the γ-secretase complex which is composed of ps <dig> or ps <dig>  substrate , and three essential accessory proteins: nicastrin, aph- <dig>  and pen- <dig>  <cit> .

the identification of compounds that selectively lower aβ <dig> provides a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that decreasing levels of this peptide will have a positive impact on aβ plaque pathology and cognition. unfortunately, the potential toxicity related to inhibition of cox as well as diverse secondary targets of this class of drugs, complicates efforts to experimentally test this hypothesis. extensive screening of nsaids, derivatives and related compounds led to the identification of r-flurbiprofen as a promising selective aβ42-lowering agent that may circumvent some of these complications  <cit> .

r-flurbiprofen is a purified enantiomer of the classical racemic nsaid, flurbiprofen, which displays minimal cox activity and does not undergo stereoinversion in humans  <cit> . like the racemate, r-flurbiprofen retains the ability to lower aβ <dig> in cell culture and in the brain of young non-depositing tg <dig> app mice following 3-days of oral dosing  <cit> . based on r-flurbiprofen's selective lowering of aβ <dig>  reduced cox activity and safety profile in humans we have previously suggested that this drug was a good candidate for clinical testing in ad  <cit> .

recently, a  <dig> year randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase  <dig> study of r-flurbiprofen  in  <dig> subjects with mild to moderate ad  was completed  <cit> . in mild ad subjects  receiving the highest dose of r-flurbiprofen , statistically significant benefit was observed in measures of activities of daily living , with positive trends in cognition . no benefit was observed in moderate ad patients. in addition, r-flurbiprofen was generally well-tolerated in this patient population. phase  <dig> studies are currently ongoing to further assess efficacy, safety, and the potential for this compound to be a disease modifying agent.

in this study we report the effect of chronic r-flurbiprofen treatment on cognition and aβ loads in a transgenic model of ad, tg <dig> app mice. tg <dig> mice were generated as follows: male tg <dig>  were crossed with c57bl/ <dig> sjl f <dig> females . these crosses generated the f <dig> tg <dig> app +/- mice , which were used in all experiments. in two separate behavioural trials, long-term treatment initiated in young tg <dig> mice with  <dig> mg/kg/day r-flurbiprofen improved spatial learning as assessed by the morris water maze . a modest reduction in biochemical aβ loads was also observed, though this did not reach statistical significance in either study. a 2-week treatment of older tg <dig> with the same dose of r-flurbiprofen decreased aβ plaque levels  but did not result in any significant alteration in spatial learning.

RESULTS
chronic administration and brain levels of r-flurbiprofen in tg <dig> mice
acute 3-day oral dosing of r-flurbiprofen in tg <dig> mice is well-tolerated at doses up to  <dig> mg/kg/day. maximal brain aβ <dig> lowering was observed with doses of 25– <dig> mg/kg/day, but doses of  <dig> mg/kg/day also lowered aβ <dig>  <cit> . in these initial short-term dosing studies no mortality or morbidity was observed. however, initial pilot long-term studies using dosing regimens designed to deliver either  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg day  resulted in 85% and 100% mortality, respectively, within  <dig> weeks. a  <dig> mg/kg/day dose did not result in increased mortality after  <dig> days, and was therefore chosen for long-term studies. experimental design, group sizes, and survival data for each of the experiments designed to deliver ~ <dig> mg/kg/day of r-flurbiprofen are shown in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  r- and s-flurbiprofen levels in the brain of mice from one water maze  were analyzed using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques and were found to be  <dig> ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/gm brain tissue respectively.

sensory and motor ability
for the behavioural analysis, the control groups were collapsed across experiments as described in the statistical analysis section, resulting in  <dig> groups for statistical analysis: control, preventative  and therapeutic . assessment of sensory and motor ability was determined by measuring the latency of mice to escape to a visible platform and their swimming speed. figure 1a shows that there were no differences between groups in escaping to the visible platform  although all groups became more proficient in escaping to the visible platform over the course of the  <dig> training trials . similar results were apparent in the pathlength the mice took to reach the visible escape platform, which showed no main effect of group  but a general decrease in distance travelled with increased training . table  <dig> shows that mice treated with r-flurbiprofen, regardless of length of administration, had modest but significantly lower swimming speed .

spatial reference memory
the spatial bias of the mice for the location of the hidden escape platform is shown by the percent of time the mice spent in the quadrant of the maze that contained the platform during the three interpolated probe trials . a main effect of group  and a significant interaction between group and probe trial  indicates that the mice in the preventative r-flurbiprofen treatment group significantly increased their spatial bias on the third probe trial  on probe  <dig>  ). the performance of the preventative group is significantly different from both the control and the therapeutic group . figure 1d shows representative swim paths of the control and the preventative group during the third probe trial. the swimming paths of the r-flurbiprofen-treated mice demonstrate a more localized search pattern over the location of the hidden escape platform , indicating a well-formed spatial bias.

strategy preference
in accordance with the increased spatial bias of the mice on the r-flurbiprofen preventive regimen, these mice also show a significant preference for using a hippocampal-dependent place learning strategy compared to the control and therapeutic groups , shown in figure 1e. the control and the therapeutic groups both preferred the use of a cue response on the competition test, thought to indicate the use of a striatal-based learning strategy  <cit> .

assessment of aβ loads
at the conclusion of behavioural testing, mice were sacrificed and assessed for biochemical loads of aβ using sequential extraction first of detergent soluble aβ followed by formic acid  soluble aβ. although both groups of mice on the preventive dose of r-flurbiprofen  displayed similar improvements of spatial learning and were pooled for analysis of behaviour, they were aged for different lengths of time following the end of water maze testing and were expected to have different levels of aβ deposition . thus, these groups were separated for biochemical analysis of aβ levels.

we observed no significant differences in detergent soluble aβ <dig> or aβ <dig> levels between the treated and control groups in experiments  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  as measured by peptide specific sandwich elisas. in experiment  <dig>  preventative r-flurbiprofen treatment and sacrifice at  <dig> months of age resulted in a non-significant reduction in fa aβ <dig>  and aβ <dig>  levels . in experiment  <dig>  a preventative r-flurbiprofen regime and sacrifice at  <dig> months of age produced no change in aβ <dig> levels but a 34% decrease in the levels of fa aβ <dig>  which did not reach significance . in experiment  <dig>  a 2-week therapeutic treatment with r-flurbiprofen in 20-month-old mice produced a non-significant lowering of aβ <dig>  and a significant lowering of aβ <dig>  . assessment of total aβ plaque load using immunohistochemical quantification failed to reveal significant differences after long-term r-flurbiprofen treatment . in contrast, short-term treatment with r-flurbiprofen at  <dig> months of age  resulted in a significant decrease in aβ plaque burden as measured by the percent immunoreactive area .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we have found that chronic administration of r-flurbiprofen is able to attenuate spatial learning deficits in tg <dig> mice that began treatment at  <dig> months of age. the improved spatial learning ability of the r-flurbiprofen-treated mice was indicated by an increased spatial bias during the third probe trial and the increased preference for using a place strategy on the strategy preference test. these results are consistent with an improvement in hippocampal/medial temporal lobe-dependent memory function  <cit> . a short 2-week administration of r-flurbiprofen in 19-month-old tg <dig> mice with ad-like aβ loads had no effect on cognitive performance. unfortunately, long-term treatment of aged tg <dig> mice with the same dose of r-flurbiprofen results in enhanced morbidity and mortality , making it difficult to perform an experiment in which older mice are treated for the same period of time.

both long- and short-term treatment of tg <dig> mice with r-flurbiprofen resulted in a decrease in the swim speed of the mice. it is possible that the decrease in swim speed in the r-flurbiprofen-treated mice observed in this study reflects a general effect of returning motor activity to normal levels in tg <dig> mice. decreases in swim speed reported in this study are unlikely to account for the effects of r-flurbiprofen on our measures of hippocampal-dependent memory as r-flurbiprofen was an effective modulator of swim speed with both the preventative and therapeutic treatment regimens but only the preventative treatment regimen increased spatial learning ability in the tg <dig> mice.

r-flurbiprofen has been demonstrated to lower steady-state aβ <dig> levels after  <dig> days of oral administration in tg <dig> mice  <cit> . in this study, however, the results indicate that a preventative treatment strategy of r-flurbiprofen administration does not significantly alter soluble, ripa extracted-aβ <dig> or  <dig> but does reduce insoluble, formic acid-soluble aβ levels 24–34%, although the decrease is not statistically significant . interestingly, the preventative treatment had no effect on plaque burden . these results contrast with the therapeutic, or short-term, treatment in 18-month-old mice where formic-acid soluble aβ <dig> levels and the aβ plaque burden was significantly decreased. the reduction in aβ <dig> levels and plaque burden did not improve spatial learning in the 18-month-old mice. clearly, these results indicate that the length of time r-flurbiprofen is administered and the age at which treatment is started are critical factors in producing beneficial effects on cognition. the relationship between cognitive improvement and aβ is controversial. improvement in spatial memory in tg <dig> mice has been shown to occur using a preventative regime of ginko biloba or alpha lipoic acid without a corresponding change in aβ levels or deposition  <cit> . in addition, several studies now show that cognitive impairment in tg <dig> mice and other app mice does not correlate well with aβ deposition and may be attributable to small soluble assemblies of aβ  <cit> . moreover, cognitive improvement can be seen following anti-aβ immunotherapy, even when there is no significant alteration in aβ deposition  <cit> . it is possible that delaying interventions until pathology is well-developed may prevent functionally significant changes in learning and memory due to irreversible changes in synaptic transmission.

the reason that the two-week therapeutic-regimen in older tg <dig>  did not lead to significant behavioral improvement is not readily apparent. however, since it appears that chronic treatment with r-flurbiprofen is necessary in tg <dig> mice for spatial learning augmentation, it seems unlikely that the drug is working through the same mechanism as the anti-aβ antibodies, which have been reported to work rapidly  <cit> . furthermore, our more recent experience with behavioral testing of app mice suggests that negative results be interpreted cautiously, since assessment of the cognitive phenotype in app mice can be variable even among cohorts of mice bred and housed in the same environment . moreover, it is possible that behavioral testing and analysis of tg <dig> mice itself alters aβ burden since it has been shown that enrichment paradigms, such as access to running wheels, appear to be capable of altering aβ deposition and cognition  <cit> . in future studies it will be important to control for possible effects of behavioral training on aβ deposition by including cohorts of treated and untreated mice that are not subject to behavioral testing.

in humans, r-flurbiprofen appears to be safe and is well-tolerated, with relatively few side effects  <cit>  and undergoes minimal racemization to the s-enantiomer  <cit> . in contrast, following oral administration to mice ~20–40% of the r-flurbiprofen is converted to the s-enantiomer . this conversion is likely to account for toxicity observed upon chronic dosing regimens more likely to alter aβ <dig> production. overall, our data demonstrate a clear cognitive benefit of long-term administration, but are inconclusive with respect to the relationship between effects on aβ deposition and behavioural improvements. previous studies have shown that chronic treatment with nitric oxide-releasing flurbiprofen derivatives do lower aβ accumulation in app mice, but it is not clear if this effect is due to the prodrug  or flurbiprofen released following metabolism  <cit> . in this study we see trends towards reduced aβ deposition in the prevention studies and small but significant decrease in aβ deposition in the therapeutic study.

aβ42-lowering nsaids have been shown to affect multiple pathways and targets that could alter the ad phenotype, any of which could contribute to their ability to protect against the development of ad  <cit> . for instance, certain nsaids reduce production of the more amyloidogenic aβ peptide by altering γ-secretase cleavage of app  <cit> . while other nsaids have also been shown to directly inhibit aβ aggregation in vitro  <cit> . they may also decrease bace expression through activation of pparγ leading to decreased levels of aβ  <cit> . in addition, more classic anti-inflammatory activities against cyclooxygenase as well as additional non-intended target activities against lipoxygenase and nfk-β could mediate beneficial effects  <cit> . in contrast, r-flurbiprofen is not a classic nsaid in humans because it does not significantly inhibit cycloxygenase enzymes; however, it is similar in structure and could bind to other known targets of nsaids as well as unknown targets. given the data presented here which suggests that r-flurbiprofen improves cognitive performance in app mice it will be important in future studies to further delineate the underling mechanisms that contribute to efficacy of r-flurbiprofen as a potential ad therapeutic.

taken together, the results from this study show that chronic treatment with r-flurbiprofen beginning at an early stage of cognitive dysfunction maybe necessary to improve learning impairments, at least in the tg <dig> app mouse model. an important caveat is that these results were obtained using a sub-optimal dose of r-flurbiprofen, which was necessitated by the toxicity of the compound at higher doses in these mice, most likely caused by bioinversion to s-flurbiprofen and the subsequent cox-mediated gastrointestinal toxicity that is not seen in humans. thus, extrapolating this dosing paradigm and results to human ad patients is difficult at best. the ongoing phase  <dig> clinical trial of r-flurbiprofen in mild ad patients should provide the most conclusive test to date of the efficacy of this drug, and the general strategy of selectively lowering aβ <dig>  in modifying the underlying disease progression and associated cognitive decline in ad.
