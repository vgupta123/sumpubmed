BACKGROUND
protecting the integrity of the dna genome is important for the long-term survival of higher eukaryotes  <cit> . given the importance of genomic integrity, it is not surprising that an elaborate system of cell cycle checkpoints and dna repair systems has evolved in higher vertebrates. however, the failure to remove dna lesions in a timely and efficient manner often forces a cell to bypass the damage in order to avoid replication stalling. this is accomplished through dna damage tolerance , an important component of the dna damage response. ddt allows replication machinery stalled at sites of dna damage to continue with dna synthesis by allowing bypass of such sites in either an error-prone or error-free manner  <cit> . the control of such a pathway is dependent on the modification status of the sliding clamp pcna.

in the absence of dna damage, yeast pcna is typically sumoylated on k <dig> which promotes normal s phase progression by preventing unwanted recombination, while replication stress results in pcna ubiquitination on the same lysine residue  <cit> . there is a central role for rad <dig>  and rad <dig> ubiquitin ligase  in pcna ubiquitination. during genotoxic stress, rad <dig> is recruited by rad <dig> to sites of dna damage where it monoubiquitinates pcna  <cit> . monoubiquitinated pcna facilitates the recruitment of error-prone translesion polymerases including polymerase η, and rev <dig>  <cit> . while undesirable, the mutations induced by this error-prone mechanism may be less deleterious than catastrophic blockage of replication forks. however, there is also an alternate complex  that forms and mediates error-free bypass by extending the monoubiquitinated pcna via k63-polyubiquitin chains  <cit> . the outcome of this polyubiquitination has yet to be fully elucidated; it clearly does not involve the proteasome but more likely involves fork reversal, recombination with an undamaged sister chromatid either at or behind the replication fork  <cit> .

a majority of the genes of the ddt pathway have been conserved from yeast to human including rad <dig>  rad <dig>  mms <dig>  ubc <dig>  pcna and most of the translesion polymerases  <cit> . as such, kannouche et al., and watanabe et al., have shown that the error-prone arm of ddt involving pcna monoubiquitination and concordant polymerase switching is fully conserved in mammalian cells  <cit> . recently, we reported that pcna is polyubiquitinated in human cells after dna damage  <cit> . accordingly, pcna polyub was shown to be dependent on rad <dig> , and also on ubc <dig>   <cit> . recently, motegi et al and unk et al. have confirmed the existence of polyubiquitinated pcna and have suggested that shprh  is the e <dig> ligase involved this process  <cit> . however, it has yet to be determined whether hmms <dig>  participates significantly in pcna polyubiquitination in human cells.

mms <dig> is a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant  protein that resembles ubiquitin conjugating enzymes  but lacks a conserved active cysteine site  <cit> . based on this original observation, it was hypothesized that uev proteins behaved as negative regulators of ubiquitination. however, biochemical evidence showed that mms <dig> forms a heteromeric complex with ubc <dig>  to catalyze the formation of k63-polyubiquitin chains  <cit> . in addition, loss of mms <dig> in yeast resulted in overt sensitivity to a variety of genotoxic agents as well as increased spontaneous and uv induced mutagenesis confirming its role in the error-free damage avoidance arm of ddt  <cit> . similar to the findings in yeast, the expression of anti-sense mms <dig> in human cells resulted in increased uv induced mutagenesis  <cit> . these data provide strong evidence of the importance of mms <dig> in the assembly of polyubiquitin chains linked through k <dig> in the error free damage avoidance arm of the ddt pathway in both yeast and humans.

since mms <dig> serves such an important role in error free dna repair in both humans and yeast and has been shown to be indispensable in yeast pcna polyubiquitination, we predicted that it would be equally important in pcna ubiquitination in mammalian cells. therefore, we examined the state of pcna ubiquitination in mouse mms <dig> knock-out embryonic stem cells and human cells in which hmms <dig> had been depleted by sirna. unlike budding yeast which has only one uev gene , human cells contain at least  <dig> uev loci. in this paper, we address the role of hmms <dig> and huev1a, the most likely functional orthologues of yeast mms <dig>  in promoting pcna polyubiquitination. we report that pcna polyubiquitination proceeds with normal kinetics in the presence or absence of mms <dig> whereas ubc <dig> or rad <dig> knockdown abrogates pcna polyubiquitination. additionally, depletion of uev1a does not disrupt pcna polyubiquitination after dna damage. this suggests that there is a high degree of redundancy built into mammalian systems and the potential for the existence of a mms <dig> variant that can compensate for the loss of hmms <dig> 

methods
cell culture and treatments
the mouse embryonic mms+/+ or mms-/- stem cells  were cultured in dmem supplemented with 15% fbs, 1x pen/strep, lif  and beta-mercaptoethanol . the hek 293t and hela cell lines were cultured in dmem  supplemented with 10% fbs . 293t and hela cells were transfected with sigenome smartpool reagent specific for human rad <dig>  ubc <dig>  mms <dig> and/or huev1a  using oligofectamine . the transfections were performed  <dig> hours prior to harvesting the cells to achieve optimal long-term knockdown as determined by immunoblotting. uv irradiation  was performed on exponentially growing cells using a uvc germicidal lamp at a fluence rate of  <dig> j/m2/s.

western blotting
rna interference and the preparation of proteins lysates were performed as described previously  <cit> . cells transfected with sigenome smartpool reagent specific for human ubc <dig>  human rad <dig> human mms <dig> or human uev1a  were uv irradiated and lysed  <dig> h post-treatment. samples were sonicated, soluble fractions were recovered, and proteins were quantified. proteins were resolved on either a one phase or two phase sds-polyacrylamide gel  and electroblotted onto a hybond c nitrocellulose membrane . the following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal  that recognizes both hmms <dig> and uev1a  <cit> , mouse monoclonal ubc <dig>   <cit> , mouse monoclonal pcna pc <dig> , and mouse monoclonal actin . proteins were visualized using supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate .

immunoprecipitations
pcna immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously  <cit> . brielfy cells were uv-irradiated with  <dig> j/m <dig> as described above and either left untreated or transfected with sigenome smartpool reagent specific for human rad <dig>  human mms <dig> and/or human uev1a . an anti-pcna antibody was incubated overnight with  <dig> μg of protein lysate. the following day, lysates were incubated with  <dig> μl of gamma-bound sepharose beads . after  <dig> h beads were washed extensively in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling in laemmli's sds sample buffer. immunoblotting was performed as described above except that the pvdf membranes  were used and autoclaved for  <dig> min in ddh2o after protein transfer, and proteins were visualized using chemiluminescent substrate .

rna extractions
e14k mouse embryonic stem  cells  were grown on  <dig> mm tissue culture dishes coated with 1% gelatin. cells were cultured at 37°c in a 5% co <dig> atmosphere, in cell medium containing high glucose d-mem  supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum,  <dig> u/ml penicillin,  <dig> μg/ml streptomycin,  <dig>  mm mem non-essential amino acids ,  <dig>  mm 2-mercaptoethanol , and  <dig>  u/ml lif . prior to total rna extraction, cells were trypsinized and collected. the cells were lysed in trizol  and total rna was isolated using the manufacturer's suggested protocol. prior to cdna synthesis, the rna samples were dnase i treated using ambion's dna-free kit as per the manufacturer's suggested protocol. total rna  was reversed transcribed using oligo <dig> and invitrogen's thermoscript rt-pcr system as per the manufacturer's protocol. the pcr step was subsequently carried out using  <dig> μl of the rt reaction,  <dig>  μm of each specific primer, and  <dig>  u of platinum taq polymerase  in a  <dig> μl reaction. both mmms <dig> and β-actin control pcr reactions were completed under the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 94°c for  <dig> minutes, a subsequent denaturation step at 94°c for  <dig> seconds, an annealing temperature of 50°c for  <dig> seconds, and an extension step at 72°c for  <dig> seconds. this was repeated for a total of  <dig> cycles and  <dig> cycles for mmms <dig> pcr and β-actin control pcr respectively, with a final extension of 72°c for  <dig> minutes. the sequences of the mms <dig> forward and reverse primers are, respectively, 5'-ggcagtctccacaggagttaaa-3' and 5'-actggaattattgatcccattca-3' to yield a  <dig> bp product. the sequences of the β-actin control pcr forward and reverse primers are 5'-aggtcatcactattggcaacga-3' and 5'-agtacttgcgctcaggagga-3' respectively, to yield a  <dig> bp product.

RESULTS
efficient knockdown of mms <dig> and uev1a
in yeast, monoubiquitination requires the ubiquitin e2/e <dig> complex rad6/rad <dig> and further polyubiqutination is dependent on the rad5/ubc13/mms <dig> complex. in mammalian cells, rad <dig> has been implicated in monoubiquitination, and shprh and ubc <dig> in polyubiquitination of pcna  <cit> . to ascertain whether mammalian mms <dig> is also required for polyubiquitination we targeted mms <dig> in hek 293t and hela cells using sirna . the mms <dig> antibody used in our studies recognizes both mms <dig> and the other mammalian homolog uev1a  <cit> . therefore to confirm effective knockdown with this antibody we performed a double knockdown with sirna targeting both hmms <dig> and huev1a. the abundance of mms <dig> and uev1a was found to be effectively reduced  <dig> hours post- transfection in both 293t and hela cells suggesting that both individual knockdowns were effective .

pcna is polyubiquitnated in the absence of mms <dig> and/or uev1a
cells treated with sirna against mms <dig>  uev1a, or both were exposed to uv light to induce dna damage and then assessed for ubiquitination of pcna. as expected, the band corresponding to monoubiquitinated pcna was unaffected by mms <dig> knockdown after uv irradiation . unexpectedly, knockdown of mms <dig> alone did not affect the higher molecular weight bands corresponding to polyubiquitinated pnca . since mms <dig> belongs to a family of uevs that have been conserved throughout evolution in higher eukaryotes  <cit>  we speculated that one of these uevs could compensate for its loss. human uev1a is an obvious candidate since it can bind to ubc <dig> and has greater than 90% amino acid sequence identity with hmms <dig>  <cit> . however, our results demonstrated little or no reduction in polyubiquitinated pcna after knockdown of uev1a alone or in combination with mms <dig>  and 1). this is in contrast to knockdown of ubc <dig>  and 2) or rad <dig>  which effectively blocked pcna polyubiquitination  and 2). these findings suggest that mms <dig> likely serves a redundant role in pcna polyubiquitination.

abrogation of mms <dig> and/or uev1a does not alter ubiquitin laddering
thus far our immunoblotting data supports the notion that mms <dig> serves a redundant role in pcna ubiquitination. however, to confirm that these bands are indeed ubiquitinated we knocked down mms <dig> and uev1a using sirna and performed a pcna immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin. despite the efficient reduction in mms <dig> and uev1a , several bands corresponding to mono, di, tri and tetra ubiquitinated species were observed in the double knockdown lane which was indistinguishable from either of the single knockdown or the control lane  and 3). importantly, this laddering pattern was similar to the ones observed from previous studies after treatment with mms, bpde or uv light  <cit> . moreover, a knockdown of rad <dig> in 293t cells demonstrates a decreased pattern of polyubiquitinated pcna as compared to the double knockdown of mms <dig> and uev1a or cells transfected with control sirnas . finally, pcna immunoblotting data  using the same lysates were consistent with the data obtained from ip's in figure  <dig>  and figure 6b .

mms2-/- knockout stem cells maintain pcna polyubiquitination
in order to confirm the results of our study in human cells and rule out the possibility of off target effects of sirna, we obtained mouse embryonic stem cells in which the mms <dig> gene had been inactivated by gene targeting. rt-pcr reactions confirmed the absence of the mms <dig> mrna . interestingly, loss of mms <dig> results in an approximate 50% reduction in the intensity of the mms2/uev1a band detected . the latter is expected since the uev1a levels remain the same and the antibody recognizes both mms <dig> and uev1a. monoubiquitination of pcna after uv treatment occurred normally and with identical kinetics in the mms2-/- cells compared to wild type. consistent with our sirna results in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  we did not observe a reduction in pcna polyubiquitination in the mms <dig> knock-out cells . finally, when we targeted uev1a in the mms2-/- cells pcna ubiquitination was not abrogated . in fact it occurred with normal kinetics as those seen in the wildtype es cells and as observed in our human cell lines.

discussion
uevs such as mms <dig> and uev1a constitute a highly conserved family of distinct e <dig> conjugating enzymes devoid of a catalytic cysteine  <cit> . functionally they act in complexes with a heteromeric partner such as ubc <dig>  the mms2/ubc <dig> or uev1a/ubc <dig> heterodimer catalyzes the formation of non-canonical k63-polyubiquitin chains that are involved in ddt and activation of nf-κb respectively  <cit> . since mms <dig> has been implicated in the error-free lesion bypass in yeast and humans and in light of the recent data demonstrating pcna polyubiquitination after dna damage in human cells  <cit> , we sought to determine whether hmms <dig> plays an important role in polyubiquitinating pcna in mammalian cells.

in the present study we demonstrate that cells partially or totally devoid of mms <dig>  and cells experiencing knockdown of both mms <dig> and uev1a do not exhibit a significant reduction in pcna polyubiquitination after uv irradiation. these results are in sharp contrast to those obtained from the knockdown of ubc <dig> or rad <dig>  in isolation, the mms <dig> findings might beg the question of whether k63-polyubiquitination is important in human dna repair. there are, however, convincing studies in the recent literature in support of the importance of hrad <dig>  hubc <dig> and shprh  in k63-polyubiquitination of pcna and its role in maintaining genomic stability  <cit> . the most parsimonious explanation of our results would therefore invoke a built in redundancy of the mms <dig> component in the higher eukaryotes.

several lines of evidence support our contention that redundancy is the best explanation. first, although hmms <dig> was shown to be involved in damage induced mutagenesis, no overt sensitivity to uv light or increased spontaneous mutagenesis was observed in human fibroblasts as it had been observed in the yeast system  <cit> . second, simpson et al., showed that disruption of mms <dig> in a chicken cell line, dt  <dig>  did not result in increased sensitivity to dna damaging agents nor did it promote sister chromatid exchange  <cit> . third, in a previous publication we demonstrated that knockdown of ubc <dig> or rad <dig> did not entirely abrogate pcna ubiquitination  <cit> . although this could be due to incomplete knockdown, recent evidence by simpson et al. have demonstrated that rad <dig> independent pcna ubiquitination occurs in rad <dig> null dt <dig> cells suggesting the presence of compensatory pcna ubiquitinating enzyme in higher vertebrates  <cit> . we believe this to be the case in human cells as well. finally, we show that pcna is ubiquitinated in the presence or absence of hmms <dig>  overall, these data highlight the inherent complexity of the ddt pathway and in particular point to a greater degree of built in redundancy in vertebrates.

given the importance of mms <dig> in yeast and human cells and our current finding we asked whether another uev gene could complement the loss of hmms <dig>  to our knowledge yeast contain only a single uev locus  while humans contain at least  <dig> uev loci including ube2v <dig> , ube2v <dig> , tsg <dig> and uev <dig> <cit> . ube2v <dig> has alternatively spliced isoforms including uev1a , kua-uev, and croc1b which vary in their 5' sequence  <cit> . such uevs may potentially complement hmms <dig>  however, based on structural studies tsg <dig> is an unlikely candidate to complement hmms <dig> as it does not bind with ubc <dig> and to date has not been shown to catalyze k <dig> polyubiquitination  <cit> . uev <dig> can also be eliminated as its sequence is very similar to tsg <dig> and it likely does not associate with ubc <dig>  <cit> . in addition, thompson et al. show that kua-uev is strictly localized to the cytoplasm  <cit> , excluding the protein from the site of dna repair and thereby excluding it as a functional substitute for mms <dig>  furthermore, a yeast two hybrid study eliminates croc1b as a candidate since it failed to show interaction with ubc <dig>  <cit> . huev1a would appear to be a strong candidate to complement mms <dig> because it can bind to ubc <dig>  localize to the nucleus, and complement the mms <dig> yeast mutant. it also has greater than 90% amino acid sequence identity with hmms <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we used sirna to target uev1a along with hmms <dig>  however, the combined knockdown of uev1a and hmms <dig> did not abrogate pcna polyubiquitination in human cells. this result is consistent with two distinct cellular roles of hmms <dig>  and uev1a  as previously shown by anderson et al. and argues against a joint or collaborative role in ddt  <cit> .

previous studies have clearly shown that the expression of anti-sense mms <dig> in human cells results in increased uv induced mutagenesis. our contention that mms <dig> is dispensible for pcna ubiquitination leads to some obvious questions concerning the role of mms <dig> in dna damage tolerance in human cells. however, it is possible that the function of mms <dig> in human cells with respect to dna damage tolerance is one that is independent of pcna ubiquitination. an intriguing possibility is that it plays a direct role in homologous recombination itself. in fact this has recently been suggested in the case for its heterodimeric partner ubc <dig> and its e <dig> ligase partner rad <dig>  <cit> . both proteins seem to be playing a direct role in homologous recombination itself. while rad <dig> seems to facilitate hr by suppressing nhej, cells deficient in ubc <dig> are unable to recruit the key hr proteins rpa, brca <dig>  and rad <dig> to sites of dna damage. this occurs due to a failure in a very early stage of hr-mediated repair of dna double strand breaks  where ubc <dig> is required to process dsbs into a competent hr substrate. this may help explain why the pcna-k164r mutant dt <dig> cells are different in certain aspects from the ones of cells deficient in rad <dig> or ubc <dig>  which implies that some aspects of dna damage tolerance are independent of pcna modification. moreover, it suggests that pcna ubiquitination might be involved in additional processes such as growth; a contention supported by the smaller size and the sub-mendelian frequency at which homologous pcna k164r mutant mice are born  <cit> . finally as shown by motegi et al. and unk et al., the function of mms <dig> in pcna ubiquitination might be linked to the one of shprh, a recently discovered functional orthologue of yeast rad <dig>  <cit> . certainly in yeast the ability of mms <dig> and ubc <dig> to ubiquitinate pcna largely depends on rad <dig>  therefore, this distinct possibility cannot be excluded from occurring in human cells with mms <dig> and shprh.

it is possible that complexes other than the heteromeric couple of ubc13/uev may be able to complement the loss of hmms <dig>  but there exists the intriguing possibility that a previously unreported mms <dig> variant  functionally complements mms <dig> in the assembly of polyubiquitin chains on the pcna of cells sustaining dna damage. we have preliminary data indicating that such a variant is present at low levels in hek  <dig> cells . if response to dna damage is compartmentalized then even low levels of the hmms <dig> variant could potentially compensate for the loss of mms <dig>  however, whether this variant form is resistant to the sirna used in this paper or if it is absent in the mouse embryonic knock cells remains to be determined. further investigations will be required to determine the ubiquity of hmms2v, its role in dna repair, whether it contains ubc <dig> binding domain, and whether sirna targeting of both hmms <dig> and hmms2v will fully abrogate pcna ubiquitination.

CONCLUSIONS
in a previous study we demonstrated that k63-linked polyubiquitination guards against environmental mutagenesis and specifically that the target of this ubiquitination pcna is dependant on rad <dig> and ubc <dig>  <cit> . it would be reasonable to assume that as the heteromeric partner of ubc <dig>  mms <dig> would be directly involved in pcna polyubiquitination, but the data reported herein are not consistent with this prediction. on the contrary mms <dig> and uev1a seem to serve redundant roles in pcna polyubiquitination suggesting the existence of an alternative mms <dig> variant or novel e <dig> that can complement the loss of mms <dig>  although our work does not identify the redundant protein, we believe the redundancy is in itself an unexpected and important finding that will spur further investigation.
