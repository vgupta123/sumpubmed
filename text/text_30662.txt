BACKGROUND
mirnas are small rna molecules of 18- <dig> nucleotides in length which regulate gene expression. precursor rnas transcribed either as independent genes or within introns of coding genes are processed by the rnaseiii enzymes drosha and dicer to form the mature mirnas  <cit> . the first mirnas were discovered as a result of their role in the timing of adult cell fate determination in caenorhabditis elegans. both let- <dig> and lin- <dig> are temporally regulated and cause a decrease in expression of target proteins which control developmental stage-specific events  <cit> . the significance of mirnas in developmental processes has now been shown in many plants and animals  <cit> .

there is growing evidence that mirnas play an important role in regulating eye development and function. in the mouse, prevention of mirna maturation by conditional knockout in retinal tissue of the dicer protein resulted in formation of photoreceptor rosettes and retinal degeneration and had a profound effect upon visual function, as measured by electroretinogram   <cit> . li and carthew reported reciprocal negative regulation between yan protein and mir- <dig> in drosophila retinal cells: yan directly represses the expression of mir- <dig> in undifferentiated progenitor cells and mir- <dig> directly represses the expression of yan in differentiated photoreceptor cells  <cit> . the switch between these mutually exclusive expression states occurs when yan degradation is triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor  signaling.

expression of various mirnas has been demonstrated in the retina  <cit> , notably a sensory organ-specific polycistronic cluster comprising mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  <cit> . the profile of mirnas expressed in the retina has been shown to change during degeneration in several mouse models  <cit> . many genes with retinal-specific functions are predicted to be targeted by mirnas and functional interactions have been demonstrated  <cit> .

mirnas were initially thought to act through inhibition of protein translation  <cit> . whilst this mechanism has been widely confirmed  <cit>  and the global impact of mirnas on protein levels demonstrated  <cit> , it has become apparent that mirnas also affect mrna levels. this was first clearly demonstrated by the observation that those mrnas with reduced expression following over-expression of a specific mirna were enriched for predicted target sites of that mirna  <cit> . many mirnas display tissue-specific expression  <cit>  and inhibit expression of genes which are found at lower levels relative to other tissues  <cit> . the action of mirnas upon mrna levels has been widely confirmed in subsequent studies  <cit> , which have also improved understanding of the properties of functional predicted target sites  <cit> .

inhibition of gene expression by mirnas is mediated by base pairing between the mirna and complementary sequences in the 3'utr of target genes. however, unlike sirnas, which direct cleavage of perfectly matched sequences, mirnas have imperfect complementarity with their target sites. the features required for a functional target site are not fully understood, but include a stretch of perfect complementarity with a ~ <dig> nucleotide 'seed' region at the 5' end of the mirna  <cit> . a range of target prediction algorithms have been developed and each mirna is thought to target approximately  <dig> transcripts  <cit> . over  <dig> human mirnas have been defined to date  and have been suggested to regulate 30% of genes  <cit> .

we have shown recently that the effects of mirnas upon mrna levels are such that the consequences of expression of a specific mirna can be detected within a single gene expression profile  <cit> . here this approach is applied to three experimental samples chosen to indicate candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels in ciliary epithelium-derived retinal stem cells from the adult eye , the developing retina during rod photoreceptor differentiation  and in the mature retina . this analysis may be indicative of those mirnas with greatest effects upon target gene expression, or may reveal a subset with targets which are more susceptible to mrna degradation. in either case, demonstration of the expression of these mirnas confirms them as candidates for future manipulation aimed at directing differentiation or maintaining the mature retina.

RESULTS
in silico prediction of candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels
each mirna was mapped to its predicted target genes in each mrna expression profile and the average levels of the transcripts of their target genes were calculated. the ranked average target gene expression values in the p <dig> retina are shown in figure 1a. the probability that each mirna has a significant effect upon gene expression was calculated using the wilcoxon ranked sum test; the results for p <dig> retina are illustrated in figure 1b. the predictions from all gene expression datasets are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> and the significant combined probabilities are shown in table  <dig> . multiple mrna expression profiles were analysed for murine ce-rscs, p <dig> and adult retina. significant predicted effects upon mrna expression were detected for multiple mirnas in the p <dig> and adult retina and for a smaller number in ce-rscs. at p <dig> many mirnas had highly significant effects, with mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> being particularly significant . in the adult retina mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were again prominent, but others, including mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and let- <dig> also had highly significant predicted effects. the greater number of genes assayed for the adult retina may have contributed to the detection of several more mirnas with significant predicted effects and the smaller p-values than at p <dig>  whilst most of the candidate mirnas predicted to affect mrna levels  at p <dig> were also in the adult, only mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were detected in all the different tissue types and developmental stages. gene expression data from human ce-rscs from adult eyes were also analysed and although many different mirnas were predicted to be affecting mrna levels, it was notable that the two mirnas with the most significant effects in murine ce-rscs, mir- <dig> and mir-485-3p, were also the 3rd and 4th most significant in human ce-rscs .

the mirnas with significant effects  upon mrna expression in mouse adult ce-rscs, p <dig> and adult retina.

we hypothesized that mirnas with detectable effects upon mrna expression are more highly expressed than those with no effect. we tested this hypothesis in the adult mouse retina using mirna expression data published by loscher et al.  <cit> . a list was compiled of mirnas whose predicted target genes exhibited significantly low expression. expression of mirnas within this group was significantly higher than that of those mirnas for which no effect on target mrnas was predicted .

experimental analysis of mirna expression
the following mirnas had highly significant predicted effects on target mrna levels and were selected for analysis by rt-pcr: mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  a range of other candidates with p-values <  <dig>  in at least one experimental condition  were selected to represent different predicted patterns of activity or for their lack of previous association with neural tissue. in addition, mir- <dig>  which had p <  <dig>  in ce-rscs and p <dig> and adult retina, was of interest because it has been previously characterised as a highly expressed, liver-specific mirna  <cit> ; the possibility of an alternative role in the retina is intriguing. let7d has previously been shown to be highly expressed in the retina  <cit>  and was used as a positive control.

the pattern of relative expression in the three samples considered  varied widely amongst mirnas . the expression of each individual mirna corresponded broadly with its predicted effects upon target gene expression . however, whilst this analysis indicates the sample in which the relative expression of a single mirna is highest, it gives no indication of the inter-mirna variation in expression in that sample. it is also important to consider the relative absolute expression of different mirnas within a single sample when considering the impact of each upon target mrna expression. therefore, starting template copy numbers were estimated for each mirna based on threshold cycle  and amplification efficiency or by the linear regression efficiency method  <cit> , which were broadly in agreement . the mirnas measured in each sample are shown in figure 3b ranked by their starting template copy number in the rt-pcr assays. those mirnas with the most significant predicted effects upon mrna expression are highly expressed. notably, mir- <dig> has amongst the most significant predicted effects upon mrna expression at all stages  and mir-125a and mir-125b are the most highly expressed mirnas in all samples . furthermore, mir- <dig> is highly expressed in p <dig> and adult retina in accordance with its predicted effects. to test the expected relationship between predicted effects and mirna expression, the estimated mirna copy numbers were plotted against predicted probability . this revealed a significant correlation , with the majority of most highly expressed mirnas having highly significant predicted effects.

in situ hybridization  was performed to localise expression of selected mirnas . expression in the adult murine retina of the well-characterised neural mirna mir- <dig> concurred with published reports  <cit> . in p <dig> retina, mir- <dig> positive signal was mainly colocalised with ganglion and amacrine cells. expression of mir-34a, which has not previously been described in the retina, was detected in the porcine ce-rsc neurospheres and throughout the mouse p <dig> retina. in the adult mouse retina the strongest signal was observed in the inner nuclear layer  and in some cells in the ganglion cell layer . mir- <dig> was expressed in all samples, notably in ce-rsc neurospheres and the inner plexiform layer of the retina at p <dig>  mir-125b was also expressed at all stages with strong signal in the inner plexiform layer at p <dig>  in the adult retina mir-125b was expressed in the inner and outer nuclear layers. no expression was observed for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> .

predicted targets of candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels
in order to identify the genes most likely regulated by mirnas in ce-rscs, p <dig> and adult retina, the target predictions for all the mirnas shown to have a significant effect upon gene expression were combined. this revealed that some genes were predicted to be targeted by almost half of the mirnas identified in each sample . these genes are the most likely to be real mirna targets because if some predicted sites are not functional others may be active. also, the co-operative action of multiple mirnas may result in greater effects  <cit> . six genes targeted by three mirnas with the highest expression and greatest predicted effects  were selected for validation: accn2; ets1; klf13; lin28b; nfib and sh2b <dig>  following transfection of hek <dig> cells with a pool of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> mirna mimics the mrna expression of  <dig> of these  <dig> genes was significantly reduced .

the top  <dig> genes in each tissue ranked by number of different mirnas predicted to target them. genes for which certain mirna interactions were assessed experimentally are marked in bold. the full list of genes targeted by at least one of the candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels is shown in table s <dig> 

comparison of the predicted mirna target genes with those known to be involved in retinal function and disease  <cit>  highlighted potential genes of interest . there was considerable overlap between known 'retinal genes' targeted by multiple mirnas in p <dig> and adult retina. for example, a gene involved in the elongation of very long chain fatty acids  is a predicted target of mirnas with the most significant predicted effects on gene expression and the highest expression in rt-pcr assays. elovl <dig> has been implicated in stargardts disease and macular dystrophy  <cit>  and is expressed in photoreceptor inner segments  <cit> , in agreement with the ish localisation of mir- <dig> , its predicted regulator. likewise, neurocalcin delta  is expressed in retinal amacrine and ganglion cells  <cit>  in agreement with the expression of mir- <dig>  one of its potential regulators  <cit> .

genes predicted to be targeted by one or more candidate mirna affecting mrna levels were compared with genes implicated in retinal function <cit> . the overlapping genes are listed, with the number of different mirnas predicted to target them followed by the gene symbol.

to establish the cellular functions which are regulated by the mirnas shown to affect mrna expression, enrichment of functional annotation terms within the predicted target genes was assessed  <cit> . the genes with target sites for those mirnas identified by our analyses were selected from the set of all genes with a conserved mirna target site predicted by targetscan; this list was therefore used as the background to assess enrichment . in all the different tissue types at different developmental stages, genes with two or more predicted sites for candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels were enriched for annotations predominately relating to regulatory functions, notably gene transcription .

discussion
mirnas regulate mrna expression in the retina
gene expression is regulated by many factors at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. the effect of mirnas within these influences is detectable through analysis of microarray expression profiles; groups of mrnas defined by presence of a putative target site for specific mirnas were expressed at a significantly lower level than the group of non-target genes. these effects were observed in developing and adult retina and to a lesser extent in ce-rscs. not surprisingly, these effects were related to the expression level of the mirna; those with extremely significant effects, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> were amongst the most highly expressed in the p <dig> and adult murine retina. the mirna expression patterns determined in this study were consistent with previous reports. for example, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> have all been independently reported to be highly expressed in the retina  <cit> . the association between the expression level of a mirna and its predicted effects on mrna expression is robust because it was demonstrated for both our qrt-pcr analysis of a relatively small number of mirnas and for global mirna expression profiles determined by other investigators  <cit> .

genes predicted to be targeted by multiple candidate mirnas affecting mrna levels are the best candidates for in vivo regulation by this mechanism. it is difficult to test this assertion in retinal cells, however the predicted effects on mrna expression were observed for five of six genes in an in vitro model. this provides some support to the predictions of individual genes affected by mirnas, at least for those targeted by multiple mirnas with highly significant overall effects on mrna expression,

the pattern of mirna activity suggests a role in retinal differentiation
the predicted effects of mirnas were less significant in mouse ce-rscs than in the p <dig> and adult retina. mirna expression was correspondingly lower, with only  <dig> of  <dig> mirnas displaying highest expression in the ce-rscs . the absolute levels of these mirnas were also lower than those highly expressed in p <dig> and adult retina. this is consistent with reports that mirna expression increases from very low levels at embryonic day  <dig>  when the retina is comprised of retinal progenitor cells with similar properties and gene expression patterns to ce-rscs  <cit> , to higher levels in the p <dig> and adult retina  <cit> . this pattern of mirna expression and predicted effects supports a role for mirnas in retinal differentiation, maturation and maintenance of the adult retina. a similar observation was noted by wienholds and co-authors, when they were able to detect only a few mirnas during early zebrafish development  <cit> .

although generally lower than in retina, mirna expression was described for the first time in this study in ce-rscs. human and porcine eyes are similar in terms of morphology and physiology. we have previously characterised porcine ce-rscs  <cit>  and therefore, although the availability of mouse expression data for ce-rscs, p <dig> and adult retina made it the choice for in silico analyses, porcine ce-rscs were used to confirm expression of predicted mirnas. ce-rscs from various species have been shown to have very similar properties and gene expression patterns  <cit>  of the  <dig> mirnas expressed most highly in ce-rscs according to rt-pcr, mir- <dig> was also predicted to have a significant effect  upon mrna expression and mir- <dig> had p =  <dig> . it has recently been shown that mir-24a represses apoptosis and is required for proper retinal development  <cit> . these mirnas could also play a role in maintaining the progenitor cell state, as has been shown in other tissues; over-expression of mir- <dig> causes a delay in maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit>  and over-expression of mir- <dig> delays differentiation of human embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

many of the specific mirnas shown to affect mrna expression in the p <dig> and adult retina have previously been implicated in neuronal differentiation. for example, mir- <dig> has been associated with the transition from neural progenitor to differentiated neuron in the zebrafish brain  <cit> . in mouse brain mir- <dig> expression is restricted to mature neurons  <cit>  and it promotes neuronal differentiation by triggering brain-specific alternative pre-mrna splicing  <cit> . the reported absence of mir- <dig> in neural and retinal stem/progenitor cells in vivo  <cit>  concurs with the lack of detectable expression in the ce-rsc spheres. expression of mir- <dig> in the immature retina  was lower than that in the adult retina and the ish signal at p <dig> mainly corresponded to early differentiating neurons, retinal ganglion and amacrine cells. our ish for mir- <dig> in the adult retina confirmed previous reports  <cit>  and showed mir- <dig> expression in all retinal layers, with particularly high levels in photoreceptor inner segments.

mir- <dig> promotes progression of neurogenesis in the zebrafish brain  <cit> . expression of mir- <dig> was not detected in ce-rscs, but in contrast to mir- <dig> it peaked in the p <dig> retina. this pattern is in agreement with xu et al  <cit> , who reported a very low level of mir- <dig> expression at e <dig> which gradually increased and peaked at p <dig>  being lower in the adult retina. notably, the transcription factor hes <dig>  which maintains retinal progenitor pools during development is a predicted target for mir- <dig>  <cit> . similarly to retinal progenitor cells, high levels of hes <dig> mrna are found in ce-rsc spheres . decrease of mir- <dig> expression past p <dig> correlates with the completion of retinal cell differentiation. mir- <dig> is another mirna with highly significant predicted effects upon mrna expression and the high expression levels for mir-125a and mir-125b detected by rt-pcr are in agreement with previous mirna array data  <cit> . together with mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  mir-125b is also induced during neural differentiation of embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

mirnas differ in their effects upon mrna turnover and translational repression
our results suggest that, although many mirnas are present in the retina, only a few affect mrna levels sufficiently to have a detectable influence on target gene expression. despite conclusive evidence of the high expression of mirnas such as mir- <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> in the retina  <cit>  the genes targeted by these mirnas did not show significant down regulation at the mrna level in our analysis. conversely mir- <dig>  which has previously been shown to direct mrna cleavage  <cit> , was expressed at a low level, but had a significant predicted effect upon target gene expression in several samples . interestingly, mir-125b, one of the mirnas with the strongest predicted effect upon mrna levels, has been shown to accelerate deadenylation leading to rapid mrna decay  <cit> . it is now accepted that mirnas can mediate both translational repression and accelerated mrna turnover  <cit> . one explanation for the detection of the effect of some highly expressed retinal mirnas upon mrna levels and not others could be that they are acting preferentially at the level of mrna turnover.

CONCLUSIONS
the evidence presented in this study suggests that many mirnas affect the expression levels of their target mrnas during retinal development. the enrichment of the predicted target genes of these mirnas for regulatory functions is in keeping with the proposed regulatory role of mirnas. the lack of a mrna 'signature' for other mirnas which are also known to be highly expressed in the retina, suggests that certain mirnas are less active at the mrna level and perhaps act predominately upon translation. the identity and expression pattern of those mirnas which were detected by analysis of target gene expression, such as mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  provides further evidence that mirnas play a central role in neuronal differentiation during retinal development.
