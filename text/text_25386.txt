BACKGROUND
potato  is the fourth largest crop in the world. due to the high altitude, cold temperature and limited virus vectoring, inner mongolia has become the largest potato producing province in china. however, due to the absence of resistance genes to p. infestans in most cultivated potato varieties, potato late blight causes dramatic yield losses in inner mongolia  <cit> . therefore, one of the major challenges for potato breeders is to decipher the resistance mechanisms to p. infestans and generate resistant cultivars through the combination of traditional and molecular breeding approaches. numerous studies have investigated the molecular basis of quantitative resistance to pathogens  <cit> , the identification of dominant resistance genes in potato  <cit> , the pathogen invasion mechanisms  <cit> , as well as potato resistant signal molecules  <cit> . previous studies also indicated that salicylic acid , jasmonic acid  and defense genes such as pr, stpk <dig>  and stlrpk <dig> are involved in resistance to potato late blight  <cit> . however, an understanding of how small g proteins regulate resistance to p. infestans in potato is lacking.

small gtpases are monomeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins  <cit> . rho gtpase, one branch of the small gtpase ras superfamily, contains three related subfamilies: rho, rac, and cdc <dig>  <cit> . in yeast and mammalian cells, rho gtpases have multiple roles in plants, regulating the cytoskeleton reorganization, cell polarity, cell wall synthesis, hydrogen peroxide  production, cell cycle and differentiation  <cit> . plants have evolved a distinct class of small gtpases named rho-related gtpase , which are very similar to racs  from mammalian cells  <cit> . plant rops not only exhibit high sequence similarity with mammalian rho gtpases, but also possess similar functions  <cit> . like their mammalian counterparts, rops are activated through guanine nucleotide exchange factors  by exchanging gdp for gtp, whereas they are inactivated by gtpase-activating proteins  and stimulate gtp hydrolysis to gdp. guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors  keep rops in an inactive form by inhibiting the release of gdp  <cit> . rops cycle between the gtp-binding form and the gdp-binding form, thus regulating a variety of cellular responses  <cit> . to date, several plant rop genes have been identified, including the  <dig> arabidopsis rop genes  <cit> ,  <dig> rice genes and  <dig> maize genes  <cit> . the proteins encoded by these rop genes regulate multiple signaling pathways, leading to a diverse array of cellular responses such as cell polarity/tip growth, cytoskeleton reorganization, secondary wall formation and plant defense  <cit> .

rho-related gtpases are clearly involved in the establishment of plant defense. in rice, osrac <dig> positively regulates the defense response to magneporthe grisea via h2o <dig> accumulation, achieved through the regulation of nadph oxidase activity  <cit> . osracb, osrac <dig> and osrac <dig> act as negative regulators in the establishment of resistance to rice blast  <cit> , but osrac <dig> regulated rice resistance in a positive manner  <cit> . in mammalian cells, overexpression of the dominant positive conformation of zmrac  also results in an increase in the production of superoxide and other ros molecules  <cit> . overexpressing the ghrac <dig> gene  in arabidopsis and hsrac <dig>  in soybean inhibits h2o <dig> production  <cit> . in arabidopsis, atrop <dig> and atrop <dig> transgenic plants exhibit increased resistance to the pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato  dc <dig> . however, atrop <dig> has the opposite effect on resistance to bacteria  <cit> . in barley, silencing hvracb increases resistance to powdery mildew by reducing fungal haustorium establishment in a cell-autonomous and genotype-specific manner  <cit> . however, stable overexpression of ca-hvracb, ca-hvrac <dig>  and ca-hvrac <dig>  in barley led to enhanced susceptibility to powdery mildew  <cit> . in tobacco, overexpression of the msrac <dig> gene results in cell death, thus leading to the development of brown necrotic lesions  <cit> . in addition, using the rna interference silencing approach in medicago truncatula plants indicates that mtrop <dig> plays a key role in ros-mediated early infection signaling  <cit> . all of the above results demonstrate that rops play an important role  on the establishment of plant defense.

reactive oxygen species including superoxide , hydrogen peroxide , hydroxyl radical  and singlet oxygen , which generated by plasma membrane nadph oxidases play pivotal roles in the defense response, and are thought to act as secondary messengers for the induction of resistance responses, such as the increased expression of defense genes and the induction of hypersensitive cell death known as the hypersensitive response   <cit> . rapid production of ros is one of the early events during incompatible interactions between plants and pathogens  <cit> . in nicotiana benthamiana inhibiting ros accumulation led to reduced resistance to p. infestans  <cit> . ros in soybean cells may interact with nitric oxide to trigger the hr, thus effectively restricting pathogen growth  <cit> . in arabidopsis, induction of ros lead to the hypersensitive cell death response and enhanced its resistance to pst and hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis  <cit> . increasing ros production in rice induces hr-like responses, greatly contributing to reduction in the size of disease lesions caused by a virulent race of the rice blast fungus and altering expression of defense-related genes  <cit> .

many studies have shown that sa  and ja  are key signaling molecules which regulate plant resistance by inducing the expression of a series of defense genes,such as pr- <dig>  pad <dig>  eds <dig>  and pdf <dig>   <cit> . sa plays a role in the establishment of resistance to biotrophic pathogen infection and systemic acquired resistance   <cit> . the non-expressor of pr gene  <dig>  is up-regulated by sa accumulation during pathogen infection and is routinely used as a marker gene to track sa-mediated signaling pathways  <cit> . a recent study established that sa is required for basal defense such as pathogen triggered immunity  in potato against p. infestans; sa reduction renders plants more susceptible to p. infestans possibly due to lower pr gene expression  <cit> . increasing sa levels in potato led to higher resistance to p. infestans  <cit> . ja is also believed to play an important role in the establishment of plant resistance to pathogens and in response to various stresses  <cit> . in plants, ja acts as a key signaling component involved in the establishment of induced systemic resistance   <cit> . lipoxygenase  is a key enzyme in the ja synthesis pathway, and the expression of the lox gene is highly correlated with ja accumulation in response to various stresses  <cit> . arabidopsis thaliana mutants impaired in the ja signaling pathway are always compromised in their resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . ja acumulation was also observed after pst dc <dig> infection  <cit> . silencing the allene oxide cyclase  or opda reductase  <dig>  genes, both coding for enzymes involved in ja biosynthesis, also perturbs the potato response to pep- <dig>  a pathogen-associated molecular pattern  from p. infestans, by reducing the accumulation of ros and hypersensitive cell death. sa accumulation has been observed in ja deficient plants  <cit> , indicating the existence of a cross talk between the ja and sa signaling pathways in the establishment of potato resistance.

we analysed atrop <dig>  a small g protein in arabidopsis and its role in the establishment of resistance to potato late blight. our results demonstrate that transient or stable overexpression of an inactive form of atrop <dig>  enhances potato resistance to p. infestans infection, a resistance associated with the accumulation of h2o <dig> mediated by a nadph oxidase homologue gene. this suggests that h2o <dig> plays a crucial role in atrop1-mediated potato resistance to p. infestans infection. additionally, preliminary results indicate the involvement of ja in atrop1-mediated potato resistance to late blight.

RESULTS
subcellular localization of atrop1
to determine the subcellular localization of atrop <dig>  a mgfp:atrop <dig> construct was transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells and the gfp signal detected under fluorescence microscopy. as shown in figure  <dig>  the green signal was observed only on the plasma membranes , while the gfp alone  was visualized mainly in the cytoplasm. hence, atrop <dig> is localized at the pm.figure  <dig>

transient expression of a dominant inactive conformation of atrop <dig>  enhance potato resistance to p. infestans
to determine the importance of atrop <dig> in the potato response to p. infestans, agrobacterium tumefaciens  strains carrying either ca-atrop <dig>  or dn-atrop <dig>  were infiltrated into potato leaves. twenty-four hours later, p. infestans  was inoculated at the infiltration sites and the lesion sizes were measured at different time points after inoculation. as shown in figure 2a, lesions were observed on potato leaves 24 hours post-inoculation  and the size expanded gradually. differences in lesion size were observed at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi. the lesions at the infiltration sites transiently expressing dn-atrop <dig> were much smaller than lesions at the sites expressing ca-atrop <dig> . quantification lesion size showed that the rate of lesion expansion after dn-atrop <dig> infiltration was much slower compared with that at ca-atrop <dig> infiltration sites . these results suggest that atrop <dig> may be involved in potato resistance to p. infestans.figure  <dig>

to understand why transient expression of dn-atrop <dig> inhibits lesion expansion on potato leaves, the development of p. infestans mycelium around the inoculation sites was firstly detected using trypan blue staining. as shown in figure 2c, compared to the sites of ca-atrop <dig> expression, fewer mycelia were observed around the sites where dn-atrop <dig> was transiently expressed . importantly, significant mycelium development was observed at the sites of ca-atrop <dig> expression and the control sites, however, fewer mycelia was detected at dn-atrop <dig> expression sites, indicating that mycelium development was inhibited to a certain extent by dn-atrop <dig> overexpression. meanwhile, real-time pcr was performed to evaluate the biomass of p. infestans. this showed that p. infestans mycelium development at the ca-atrop <dig> and dn-atrop <dig> transient expression sites was significantly lower than control sites, with dn-atrop <dig> expression sites showing the lowest biomass levels . in conclusion, the small lesion size at dn-atrop <dig> transient expression sites could be correlated with limited growth of p. infestans.

next, we investigated the possible mechanisms underlying the inhibition of p. infestans development in potato after dn-atrop1expression. recent studies showed a tight link between rops and ros accumulation  <cit> . this prompted us to analyze h2o <dig> accumulation by dab staining at the p. infestans infection sites. at the dn-atrop <dig> expression sites, h2o <dig> was observed  <dig> hpi, accumulated dramatically by  <dig> hpi and was still at high levels at  <dig> hpi . however, this was not the case at the ca-atrop1expression sites. in figure 3b, quantification of dab staining showed that both constructs led to increased h2o <dig> levels after inoculation with p. infestans. however, accumulation of h2o <dig> was much higher at the dn-atrop <dig> expression sites than that at the ca-atrop <dig> expression sites. we propose that the high level of h2o <dig> accumulation at dn-atrop <dig> expression sites may be one of the causes of the increased resistance to p. infestans, illustrated by the inhibition of p. infestans development and the smaller lesion size on potato leaves.figure  <dig>

dn-atrop <dig> enhances potato resistance to p. infestans
to confirm the results observed in the transient expression system, we generated dn-atrop <dig> transgenic potato lines via a. tumefaciens mediated transformation. the leaf disc method was used to generate transgenic lines, and positive transgenic lines were confirmed by southern blot analysis  and western blot using a commercial anti-gfp antibody . dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were chosen for further functional analysis.figure  <dig>

we first checked symptom development on transgenic potato leaves after inoculation with p. infestans. as shown in figure 5b, when the control line showed discoloration symptoms  <dig> hpi, lesions had not appeared on the dn-atrop <dig> transgenic potato leaves. mycelium development on transgenic potato leaves was detected by trypan blue staining. the sparse mycelium of p. infestans was detected in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic potato leaves at  <dig> hpi, whereas, the control leaves expressed the empty vector, showed a mass of blue staining under the microscope . p. infestans biomass in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic potato leaves  was detected by real-time pcr. quantitative analysis indicated reduced development of p. infestans in the three dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines compared to the control plants , suggesting that the dn-atrop <dig> transgene inhibits the development of p. infestans in potato leaves, thus increasing potato resistance to late blight.figure  <dig>

h2o <dig> is involved in potato atrop1-mediated resistance to p. infestans
in order to verify that h2o <dig> plays a key role in resistance of potato dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines to p. infestans, we analyzed h2o <dig> levels in the transgenic lines via dab staining. brown color was observed in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic leaves at  <dig> hpi, whereas no signal was detected in control plants. accumulation of h2o <dig> was observed in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic plants at  <dig> hpi with higher levels at  <dig> hpi, while the control plants only showed a slight increased in brown color . quantification of h2o <dig> levels  showed that the accumulation of h2o <dig> followed the same temporal pattern in the dn-atrop <dig> and control lines, but levels were significantly higher in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines . compared with control, all transgenic lines tested had higher h2o <dig> levels from 12hpi to 96hpi after inoculation suggesting that atrop <dig> negatively regulated potato resistance via h2o <dig> accumulation.figure  <dig>

atrop <dig> negatively regulats h2o <dig> accumulation via a potato nadph oxidase homologues
we detected the accumulation of h2o <dig> after inoculation with p. infestans in dn-rop <dig> transgenic lines. this data prompted us to check whether membrane-located strboh  is the main regulator of h2o <dig> production in these transgenic lines. rt-pcr was performed using primers derived from strboh-d, as shown in figure 7a and b; transcript levels of strboh-d were compared in dn-atrop <dig> and control plants at different time points after inoculation . in control plants, expression decreased by  <dig> hpi and was not detected at  <dig> hpi. however, in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic plants, mrna levels of strboh-d gene remained constant at  <dig> hpi, decreasing slightly by  <dig> hpi, to almost half the control level by 96hpi . these results suggest that the membrane localised strboh-d gene may cause the accumulation of h2o <dig> in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines after inoculation with p. infestans.figure  <dig>

ja may play a role in the resistance of dn-atrop <dig> transgenic potato to p. infestans
sa and ja are major signaling hormones involved in the establishment of plant resistance to the pathogens. to check whether ja- and sa-dependent signaling pathways were involved in dn-atrop1-associated resistance to p. infestans, we analyzed the transcript levels of sa and ja marker genes. these marker genes were npr <dig>  a central component of the sa signaling pathway and up-regulated by sa accumulation, and lox, which encodes a key enzyme in the ja biosynthetic pathway. as shown in figure 8a and b, lox transcript levels decreased dramatically in control plants by  <dig> hpi and were not detectable at  <dig> hpi, whereas in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic plants, lox mrna remained constant until  <dig> hpi and decreased gradually afterwards. the transcript profile of npr <dig> was also studied. quantification of expression data indicated that the npr <dig> basal level in dn-atrop <dig> plants was slightly lower than in control plants , and decreased further by 24hpi after inoculation with p. infestans. these results indicated that ja signaling may be involved in atrop1-mediated potato resistance to late blight.figure  <dig>

discussion
subcellular localization of the atrop <dig> protein
using a transient expression system, the subcellular localization of atrop <dig> was investigated using gfp tagging in tobacco epidermal cells. our results showed that mgfp:atrop <dig> was mainly localized at the pm  . in mammalian and plant cells, nadph oxidase is responsible for the generation of h2o <dig> and is also located at the pm  <cit> . this raises the possibility that atrop <dig> may regulate a nadph oxidase homologue at the pm, thus facilitating the accumulation of h2o <dig>  the same result was obtained in rice, where osrac <dig> is also located at the pm and regulates h2o <dig> production, thus enhancing rice resistance to m. grisea  <cit> . the pm is proposed to be the platform for conveying signal transduction from small g proteins to downstream factors, thus enhancing the establishment of potato defense responses.

atrop <dig> negatively regulates potato resistance to late blight via accumulation of h2o2
small gtpases of the rac/rop family play important roles in the establishment of plant defense responses  <cit> . in rice, overexpression of osrac <dig> enhanced host resistance by increasing h2o <dig> levels  <cit> ; silencing this gene in rice led to the development of larger lesions than in control plants after infection with a rice blast pathogen  <cit> . further studies on osrac1function revealed that a constitutively active form of osrac <dig> promotes h2o <dig> production  <cit> , whereas a dominant negative form of osrac <dig>  leads to the suppression of h2o <dig>  <cit> . additionally, expressing dominant negative forms of human rac <dig>  in soybean or osrac <dig> in rice cell suspensions also leads to the suppression of h2o <dig> production in response to an elicitor treatment. this suggests the existence of a positive regulation mechanism by small g proteins on plant resistance mediated by h2o <dig> accumulation  <cit> . however, small g proteins may play more complex roles indicated by the expression of a dominant negative form of osrac <dig>  in tobacco. this led to induced h2o <dig> accumulation after infection with tobacco mosaic virus   <cit>  and overexpression of ntrac <dig>  in tobacco led to lower levels of h2o <dig>  <cit> .we showed that the transient and stable expression of a dominant negative form of the arabidopsis atrop <dig>  gene in potato led to a decrease in the development of p. infestans at the infection sites. this suggests a negative regulation mechanism of atrop <dig> on potato resistance to late blight. h2o <dig> was found to be a key player in the signaling pathway associated with atrop1-mediated potato resistance. the overexpression of a negative form of atrop <dig> resulted in the accumulation of h2o <dig>  and enhanced potato resistance to p. infestans infection. h2o <dig> is known to be a key player during the establishment of plant resistance  <cit> . the rapid production of h2o <dig>  which triggers the hr in the infected areas, was observed in plants infected by non-host or avirulent strains of pathogens. in our study, overexpression of dn-atrop <dig> promoted the accumulation of h2o <dig> after p. infestans infection, which possibly triggered an hr in the infected area, thus limiting the development of p. infestans, and resulting in smaller lesions . therefore the increase in h2o <dig> accumulation may result in enhanced resistance of transgenic potato lines to late blight. our data are in perfect agreement with what was observed in tobacco lines overexpressing dn-osrac <dig>  which also exhibited smaller lesions after tmv infection  <cit> .

h2o <dig> accumulation in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines is mediated by nadph oxidase
generally, the production of h2o <dig> can be achieved either by mitochondrial electron transport during aerobic respiration or by oxidoreductases and metal-catalyzed oxidation. the activation of a membrane-associated nadph oxidase constitutes the main source of h2o <dig> accumulation  <cit> . strong induction of strboh which is a homologue of the nadph oxidases catalytic subumit is observed not only in potato leaves, but also in potato tubers after infection with p. infestans  <cit> . in our study, sustained increased expression of strboh in potato transgenic lines was observed after inoculation with p. infestans. however, its expression was suppressed dramatically in control plants. this indicates that the accumulation of h2o <dig> in the transgenic lines was likely to be caused by the sustained expression of the membrane-localisted strboh. meanwhile, the plasma membrane localization of both atrop <dig> and strboh suggests that the pm may be the platform connecting atrop <dig> and strboh, thus facilitating the accumulation of h2o <dig>  catalase is a major h2o <dig> scavenging enzyme inside plant cells, and hydrolyses h2o <dig> into h2o and o <dig> to protect plant cells from deleterious effects of h2o <dig>  <cit> . however, we did not observe differences in the transcript levels of catalase between control and transgenic lines after infection with p. infestans, suggesting that h2o <dig> accumulation is mainly caused by potato homologues of pm-localized nadph oxidases.

ja is involved in potato resistance regulated by atrop1
sa and ja are important signaling molecules in plant responses to pathogens. to check whether they were involved in the increased resistance of dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines to p. infestans, the transcript level of marker genes in these two pathways was estimated by rt-pcr. our data showed that lox gene expression was induced in dn-atrop <dig> transgenic lines during p. infestans infection, indicating that the ja pathway was activated by dn-atrop <dig> overexpression, whereas the sa signaling pathway was partially suppressed in this study.

our data differ from previous reports showing that the sa signaling pathway was activated, and the ja signaling pathway was inhibited to a certain extent during p. infestans invasion of the resistant potato cultivar zihuabai  <cit> . in addition, sa was found not only to regulate basal defense of potato against p. infestans, but was also involved in the establishment of systemic acquired resistance of potato induced by baba  <cit> . however, rosah and his colleague found that pamp responses in potato required both sa and ja, indicating that ja is required for potato resistance establishment  <cit> . so, atrop <dig> overexpression may activate pamp-induced resistance pathways, thus enhancing potato resistance to p. infestans. a recent study established that ja and sa signaling pathways act antagonistically in potato  <cit> . the decreased npr <dig> transcript levels and the concomitant increase in ja after inoculation with p. infestans suggest a conservation of the antagonistic effects of sa and ja. in addition to sa and ja, there are other hormones involved in plant resistance, such as ethylene , brassinosteroids, cytokinins , and auxin. among them, the brassinosteroids and cks were shown to enhance the plant resistance to pathogens through npr <dig>  <cit> , a master regulator in the sa signaling pathway. ethylene was confirmed to be antagonistic to sa signaling pathway  <cit> , while auxin may lead to enhanced susceptibility to biotrophic pathogens by affect sa biosynthesis  <cit> . our data have shown that expressing dn-atrop <dig> led to decreased npr <dig> transcript levels after infection with p. infestans, indicating that atrop <dig> may positively regulated the npr <dig> expression in potato.

CONCLUSIONS
we verified that atrop <dig> could regulate potato resistance to late blight. the dn-atrop <dig> appears to positively impact potato resistance to late blight, through activation of membrane-associated nadph oxidase, thus facilitating h2o <dig> accumulation. we propose that h2o <dig> accumulation in turn limits p. infestans development, leads to smaller lesion size and enhances potato resistance to late blight. our results also indicate that ja may be involved in atrop1-mediated potato resistance to p. infestans.
