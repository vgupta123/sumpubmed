BACKGROUND
rna silencing is a highly conserved and versatile genetic surveillance and regulatory mechanism occurring in all higher eukaryotes. it is mediated by a large network of interacting effector molecules, and connected to several parallel regulatory and signaling pathways. it affects, both directly and indirectly, cellular processes varying from the cell cycle regulation and chromatin structure maintenance to transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation, to stress and hormonal signaling, and to developmental differentiation  <cit> . thus, rna silencing plays a central role in manifestation of the genetic information of different eukaryotes. many of the effector molecules of the silencing processes themselves are also regulated by specific silencing mechanisms, and many of the silencing-related regulatory pathways are interconnected in multidimensional networks  <cit> .

the silencing process is induced by double stranded rna  structures. these are recognized and cleaved into small fragments of 20– <dig> nucleotides by the rnase iii type endonuclease dicer in animals, or by various dicer-like  homologues in plants. depending on the source and form of the inducing dsrna molecules, the products are called either micrornas  or small interfering rnas : mirnas are cleaved from the hairpin structures of endogenous pre-mirna transcripts, and they target specific complementary sites in their specific target transcripts. the sirnas are cleaved from any nonspecific dsrna molecules, and consequently target dna or rna sequences that bear homology to the inducing dsrnas. in all cases, the small rna fragments function as guide sequences for the silencing machinery: they are loaded into argonaute -containing effector complexes, i.e. into rna-induced silencing complexes , or into rna-induced transcriptional silencing complexes , and guide these complexes to homologous rna or dna sequences to mediate their degradation or translational suppression, or methylation, respectively .

the silencing networks are also essential in maintenance of cellular health and integrity. in animals, they play a major role in suppression of oncogeny  <cit> , and in plants, they are involved with hormonal signaling and defense reactions against some bacterial pathogens  <cit> . in plants, rna silencing is particularly used as the major defense mechanism against virus diseases . various virus-specific dsrna structures  function as efficient silencing inducers. these are processed to 21nt sirnas by the dcl <dig> enzyme, or optionally by dcl <dig>  and then mediate degradation of the homologous viral rnas by the silencing machinery.

the virus-host interaction is further complicated by the production of virus-encoded suppressors of rna silencing . most, if not all plant viruses encode for at least one gene product that functions as a vsrss. many of the vsrss mediate also some other essential viral function, e.g. several of them function as viral cell-to-cell or long distance movement proteins, coat proteins, replicases, helper components for viral transmission, proteases, or transcriptional regulators. thus the vsrs produced by different virus families are different, with very different functional mechanisms  <cit> . for most vsrss the exact modes of action are not well understood as yet, but obviously, through their interactions with the host silencing machinery  they can strongly intervene with the regulatory pathways and networks of the host plants.

several vsrss have been expressed as transgenes in different host plants to study their interactions with the silencing machinery, and with plant endogene regulation. some of these transgenes severely disturb the plant phenotypes and mirna or mrna expression profiles and affect their susceptibility to further viral infections, while some other transgenes have minimal or no effects on the plant phenotypes  <cit> . these differences obviously depend on the specific vsrss, and possibly also on the specific host/vsrs combinations that have been used in these studies.

the p <dig> protein encoded by the potato virus x  is a multifunctional protein that acts as both vsrs and cell-to-cell movement protein  <cit> . we have previously reported production and characterization of transgenic tobacco lines that express this vsrs gene  <cit> , and here we report a microarray analysis  of the transcriptome of both leaves and flowers of these plants. the results indicate major changes in the transcript profile of the leaves, but only minor alterations in the transcripts of flowers of these transgenic plants.

RESULTS
p <dig> vsrs –expressing transgenic tobacco plants , along with tobacco lines expressing various other vsrs  have been previously produced and characterized in our laboratory  <cit> . we have earlier described a p25-expressing line with very low transgene expression level, that caused no detectable phenotype alterations in the plant, but for this study we have chosen a t3-line that accumulates p <dig> mrna on higher levels. expression level of the transgene transcript was equal in leaves and flowers of the same plants, as detected by northern blotting and by quantitative rt-qpcr , but varied slightly between the sibling plants of the same t3-line . as an altered phenotype, these plants showed a reduced growth, with height of the fully grown plants being about 10% lower than that of the wild type plants, and slightly enhanced senescence of lower leaves, as compared to wild type plants .

leaf samples  were collected both from the transgenic and wild type control plants at about one and half months after germination, at plant height of approximately  <dig> centimeters. the p25-transcript levels were equal between these transgenic plants . our previous microarray analyses have revealed that the transcript profiles of control plants transformed with the empty pbin <dig> transformation vector are approximately equal to those of the wild type healthy plants  <cit> , and therefore only the wild type plants were used here as controls. flower samples were collected from the same plants one day before flower opening. upon rna isolation and quality controls the microarray analysis was done, and the obtained data analysed as described in the methods, and by soitamo et al.  <cit> .

many of the tobacco microarray probes are identified only by est codes in the manufacturer’s specifications. additional gene identifications for many of the positive microarray detections were obtained from the http://mapman.gabipd.org/web/guest/mapman-annotationexperts webpage. for those probes that were not found in this database additional annotation information was searched from the tair data base  and by the blastn- and blastx programs . initial functional grouping for all the identified, significantly altered transcripts was obtained from the mapman database. however, many of the tentative functions could be associated with several biological roles, e.g., the genes related to disease responses may function also as transcription factors, in signaling, or can be related to cell wall modifications  <cit> . therefore the functional grouping was manually adjusted to correspond to assumed gene induction during plant viral infection. some related groups were also combined to reduce the total number of groups for clearer visual presentation.

using the two-fold cut-off-value for the up- and down-regulated genes and the stringent selection criteria of bh false discovery rate of 5%, the array data revealed that a total of  <dig>  spots produced a significantly  up-regulated signal from the leaf total rna . a full list of all detected up-regulated genes is given in additional file  <dig>  the main types of the up-regulated genes detected in each functional group, and the range of their amplification levels are also listed in additional file  <dig>  using the same stringent criteria only  <dig> transcripts of the leaves were found to be reduced to the  <dig> -fold or lower level.  <dig> and  <dig> transcripts were found significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in the flowers of the p <dig> expressing plants as compared to the wild type plants .

selected up- and down-regulated genes were analyzed by the quantitative real time pcr  to verify the array data for both leaf and flower samples of the transgenic vs. wild type plants. the rt-qpcr results correspond approximately to the microarray results obtained for these genes .

expression levels of some clearly up-regulated genes were tested by rt-qpcr. statistical significance was tested using student t-test , with bh value of <  <dig> . the depicted log <dig> values are normalized median intensive value  differences of wild type and p25-expressing transgenic plants. the standard error of the mean  is calculated for the ct values of the rt-qpcr results.

as tobacco genome has not been sequenced, the annotation of the significantly up- or down-regulated genes were mostly based on similarities to known genes or to known functional domains in other species, and thus the names, alleles or biological functions could not be accurately determined for all the detected transcripts. in many cases there were also more than one probes, with different est-codes for the same rnas. thus, the array data revealed only the number of altered hybridization events within the given set of  <dig> probes, but did not provide accurate numbers for the actual up- or down-shifted genes. still, the repetitive detections of the same genes, their multiple alleles, multiple members of the gene families, or of genes belonging in the same pathways confirmed the alterations in the expression levels of these genes in the transgenic plants.

up-regulated transcripts related to biotic and abiotic stress in leaves
the annotated and functionally categorized microarray data revealed that the p25-protein expressing plants were primed for a strong pathogenesis-like condition  <cit> : a total of  <dig> up-regulated transcripts belonged to the genes that are induced by various biotic and unspecific stresses . this group included, for instance, a total of  <dig> genes coding for various pathogenesis-related proteins . many of these were very strongly induced, even up to three thousand folds, which rate is also explained by their very low or undetectable expression level in the healthy control plants. also various disease resistance genes , and genes coding for avr9/cf- <dig> and hairpin elicited proteins , various chitinases and endochitinases , systemic acquired resistance  -associated proteins  and hypersensitive cell death  –associated proteins  were strongly induced. interestingly, this analysis detected also enhanced expression of a tmv-response  related transcript, although this tobacco variety is of the nn type and does not contain the functional n-gene. thus, the non-functional allele  is induced in a similar fashion by disease stresses as is the functional resistance gene n.

enhanced stress and disease resistance status was also indicated by the strong enhancement of various transcripts  related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, with maximal, about 200-fold enhancement occurring in the epi-aristolochene synthase. transcripts coding for the phytoalexins and various flavonoids, cinnamoys and terpenoids that may serve as constitutive or inducible chemical inhibitors of various pathogens  <cit>  were also enhanced. of special interest is the enhanced expression of ref/srpp-like isoprenoids, as these are needed for mirna function and affect membrane association of ago <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the enhanced response to biotic stresses, also various indicators of abiotic stresses were induced , although not as strongly as those for the biotic stresses. the highest induction levels in this category were those for the metal binding protein genes  and the oxidative stress genes . in addition, a total of  <dig> transcripts of various heat shock proteins and chaperones were enhanced by  <dig> –  <dig> -folds. other up-regulated stress genes were associated to dehydration/desiccation, osmotic stress and senescence.

up-regulation of transcripts related to protein synthesis and modification, and to metabolic networks in leaves
many transcripts coding for the protein synthesis machinery, protein transport and processing, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, membrane-associated proteins and molecular transporters were also strongly altered in the p25-expressing plants . a total of  <dig> transcripts related to transcription or translation initiation or to the translation machinery were increased by 2– <dig> -fold suggesting that, in addition to the increase of various transcript levels, also the protein synthesis was enhanced. maybe to balance this disturbance, also a large number  of transcripts associated with the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, or encoding various proteases, endopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, hydrolases and numerous aaa-type atpase transcripts were enhanced to variable extent  .

multiple changes were detected in the sugar and amino acid metabolism related transcripts: photochemistry-related signaling was altered by strong induction of two par–transcripts and of three ethylene induced genes. in addition, a total of  <dig> transcripts coding for various sugar metabolism-related genes and  <dig> transcripts coding for components of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain were enhanced in the range of  <dig> –  <dig> -fold.

up-regulation of membrane and lipid metabolism and of molecular translocation in leaves
a total of  <dig> transcripts coding for various membrane proteins were enhanced by  <dig> – 12-fold. in addition,  <dig> transcripts related to various membrane or lipid modification activities were enhanced, some up to 94-fold . also  <dig> transcripts associated with various cell wall modification activities were enhanced, including transcripts for cell wall degrading enzymes xyloglucan endotransglucosylase–hydrolases , and glucan endo- <dig> -beta-glucosidase . of special interest is the enhancement of transcripts for pectin methyl esterase  inhibitor-type proteins which, by their action on pme may contribute to silencing suppression  <cit> .

transport and translocation of various metabolites appeared to be disturbed in these transgenic plants as nearly a hundred transport- and secretion-related transcripts were enhanced:  <dig> transcripts related to protein secretion to various membranous compartments  were enhanced up to 33-fold.  <dig> transcripts coding for various amino acid and oligopeptide transporters, and  <dig> transcripts coding for transporters for various phosphates, sulphates, ammonium ions, metals and nitrates were also enhanced, as were eight transcripts for ion channels and seven transcripts for sugar transporter, and a total of  <dig> miscellaneous transport related transcripts. enhanced abiotic stress appeared to be associated with the induction of  <dig> transcripts encoding for different multidrug resistance proteins, or abc transporters.

in addition to the mentioned functional groups, also  <dig> transcripts related to dna binding, and  <dig> transcripts related to cytoskeleton were induced up to 10–fold in these plants. also  <dig> transcripts coding for proteins with a duf-domain, i.e. domains with unknown functions  <cit> , and a large number of transcripts with no clear functional identification , as well transcripts with no identification of the coding sequence  were significantly enhanced in the transgenic leaves .

regulatory factors for enhanced gene expression in leaves
induction of the large battery of the defense-related genes is clearly associated with strong induction of the signaling factors that serve as primary regulators of the defense pathways. typically, plant defense responses are induced by salicylic acid , ethylene  and jasmonic acid   <cit> . induction of these regulatory pathways  in the p25-expressing plants was indicated by strong  enhancement of two transcripts coding for one key signaling factor in the sa-induced pathway, i.e. the enhanced disease susceptibility  factor  <cit> . likewise five transcripts coding for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  synthase, oxidase and deaminase, and two transcripts coding for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, all involved in the ethylene biosynthesis  <cit>  were strongly enhanced, even up to 95-fold. several transcripts for ethylene induced signaling or transcription factors  were enhanced by up to 40-fold. eight transcripts coding for membrane–degrading lipoxygenases, leading to ja synthesis  <cit>  were enhanced by up to 5-fold. also several ethylene responsive , auxin responsive , and gibberellin related  transcripts were induced. ethylene response transcription factor  <dig> , i.e. the key signaling factor which integrates signals from et and ja signaling pathways  <cit> , and erfs  <dig> and  <dig>  were enhanced by 5– <dig> -folds.

further on, numerous transcripts  for different transcription factors, some of them known to be regulated by erf <dig> or by ja  <cit> , were enhanced in the p25-expressing plants. these included  <dig> transcripts for wrky domain proteins, and multiple transcripts for pti <dig>  rav, nac and myb-like transcription factors, some of which are known to be transcriptional regulators of various disease responses  <cit> .

the enhanced transcription factors included also several that function as developmental regulators and are typical targets for silencing-mediated regulation, i.e. the scarecrow, ap <dig> and gras –type transcription factor with the della domain, waf related cluster , the floral identity gene leafy  <cit> , and multiple transcription factors containing the nam  or nac domains, known to be involved in many developmental processes as well as in defense reactions  <cit> . also chromatin methylation associated histone deacetylation  gene and high mobility group b  <dig> transcription factor gene were up regulated . enhancement of four microsatellite dna transcripts  as well as of five retro element-related sequences  suggested reduced methylation level of the genomic dna.

of special interest among the induced rna-related regulatory mechanisms was the induction of the dcl <dig> enzyme, known to serve as the alternative effector molecule, in addition to dcl <dig>  in silencing of viral rnas  <cit> , of ago <dig>  known to function in virus-defense-related silencing  <cit> , and of rna dependent rna polymerase  <dig>  known to function as an endogenous silencing suppressor  <cit> .

calcium and phosphorylation mediated signaling and regulatory networks were also altered . a total of  <dig> transcripts related to protein phosphorylation and ca-mediated signaling were enhanced, including various ca-binding proteins and calmodulins , e.g. the rgs-calmodulin, the endogenous silencing inhibitor protein  <cit> . enhanced signaling-related genes included also various kinases  and receptor kinases , as well as some phosphatases. of special interest is the induction of several  mk <dig> and map <dig> kinases, and map kinase kinases , known to mediate the signaling cascade that leads to transcriptional activation of various defense genes, e.g. some wrky transcription factors  <cit> .

in these transgenic plants, a total of  <dig> transcripts coding for various glutathione-s-transferase enzymes were enhanced by up to 80-fold, and a total of  <dig> transcripts coding for various cytochrome p <dig> or closely related enzymes were enhanced by up to 63-fold. these enzymes are known to function in cells as antioxidants, and to detoxify and degrade endogenous compounds such as peroxidased lipids and various harmful metabolic intermediates and toxins  <cit> .

down-regulated transcripts in leaves
as mentioned earlier, only five transcripts  were found to be significantly reduced, by applying the stringent selection criteria of bh false discovery rate of 5%. by neglecting this stringency test some  <dig> transcripts were also found to be reduced to  <dig> -fold or lower level, as compared to the wild type plants, but these reductions were much more moderate and inconsistent than the up-regulation of various transcripts . the most interesting group among these mildly down-regulated transcripts was that of the photosynthesis-related functions, including the photosynthesis-related calvin cycle transketolase, light reaction-related atp-synthase and a post-illumination chlorophyll fluorescence increase protein , photosystem i assembly and stability factor, and several transcripts for phototropic-responsive nph <dig> family proteins functioning in light signaling  <cit> .

altered gene expression in the flowers of p <dig> expressing plants
from the samples extracted from unopened flowers, only  <dig> transcripts were detected as significantly up-regulated and  <dig> as significantly down-regulated in the microarray analysis. as in leaves, the most significant up-regulated functional group was that of transcripts associated with various biotic stresses, including  <dig> transcripts coding for different pathogenesis-related proteins,  <dig> transcripts coding for various chitinases and endochitinases, and  <dig> transcripts coding sar-related proteins. the up-regulated transcripts included also the photosystem ii  <dig> kda protein and rubisco small subunit proteins, up-regulated by 4- and 3- fold, respectively. up-regulated genes included also e.g. one glutathione transferase, two vetispiradiene synthase and three epoxide hydrolase transcripts .

the transcripts that were found to be down-regulated in flowers included three transcripts for methylthioadenosine nucleosidase, three transcripts for glycine-rich proteins, as well as a transcript for photosystem i reaction center subunit psan .

alterations in the protein profile in leaves of p <dig> expressing plants
major changes observed in the accumulation of various mrnas in p25-expressing plants, including the mrnas coding for some key components of the translational machinery  and also in the protein degradation machinery  suggested that the total protein content or the protein profile of the plants might be significantly altered. however, the total protein content of the p <dig> expressing plants was found to be equal to that of the wild type plants, measured as weight of soluble protein per fresh weight unit of the leaves. also the protein profile, as revealed by 2d-page from the phenol extracted samples was very similar to that of the wild type plants . in repeated analysis of protein samples  extracted from the third leaf of different plants we sometimes observed increase of several protein spots , and sometimes a clear reduction of multiple spots, but these changes were not consistent in all the gels and thus we conclude that there was no significant alteration in the protein profile of the p25-expressign plants, as compared to the wild type plants.

photosynthetic activity
to analyze the overall physiological condition of the transgenic plants, as indicated by their photosynthetic activity, their o <dig> evolution activity was determined from freshly isolated thylakoid membranes at different light intensities. the measurement indicated that the photosynthetic activity was reduced by approximately 20% in the transgenic leaves, not depending on the light intensities . interestingly, this reduction is the same as has been earlier reported for tobacco plants infected with the pvx virus  <cit> . here, it was apparently related to the mild down-regulation of several photosynthesis-related transcripts  in these p25-expressing leaves.

responses to biotic and abiotic stresses
the massive induction of various transcripts related to active defense against various plant diseases  suggested that the plants should be primed for enhanced resistance against various pathogens  <cit> . this was tested by infiltrating the leaves with a suspension of pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato dc  <dig> cells. these cells were avirulent in the wild type tobacco leaves, causing either no, or only very minor hypersensitive reaction in the infiltrated leaf zones. when infiltrated to p25-expressing plants, they caused clear hr-response within  <dig> days after infiltration .

high expression levels of transcripts coding for various peroxidases, oxidases, reductases and oxidoreductases suggests that these factors might be associated with high oxidative stress in the leaves. the existence of such stress was tested by dab and ntb-staining of the leaves  <cit> . the p25-expressing leaves produced essentially the same staining pattern as the wild type leaves, with only minor background darkening, indicating that the plants did not contain any additional oxidative compounds .

genes commonly induced with the hc-pro and ac <dig> silencing suppressor expressing plants
the transcripts enhanced in the p25-expressing plants were compared to the genes that have been found to be enhanced in other transgenic tobacco lines, expressing either the pvy-derived vsrs hc-pro, or acmv-derived vsrs ac <dig>  although large number of gene expression alterations have been observed also in the hc-pro and ac <dig> expressing leaves , the alterations patterns were distinctly different between these three types of plants, with only  <dig> common transcripts being enhanced in all of these transgenic plants . the commonly induced transcripts included transcripts related to plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses . also some transcripts associated with cell wall modifications  and transcripts related to transport, senescence and ripening, secondary metabolite biosynthesis and oxidative stress were induced in all these transgenic plants .

discussion
here we report microarray  mediated analysis of the transcriptomic profile of transgenic tobacco plants that express the p <dig> rna silencing suppressor of the pvx virus. according to the microarray results, this transgene caused a significant up-regulation of numerous  transcripts, with induction levels ranging up to 3000-fold level. this up-regulatory effect, as compared to the low number of significantly down- regulated genes  indicated that the transgene caused active silencing suppression in the tobacco plants. a special feature of these gene expression alterations was that they were detected mostly in the leaf samples. in flowers, the levels of only a few transcripts  were slightly altered.

the altered gene expression profile was associated only with mildly reduced growth, and occasionally, premature yellowing of the lower leaves, which apparently correlated to the slightly reduced photosynthetic activity and the enhanced ethylene expression in these plants. this phenotype is in good agreement with previously published phenotype of p25-expressing tobacco plants  <cit> . also the observed reduction of the photosynthetic rate was the same as what has been reported for tobacco plants infected with pvx virus  <cit> , indicating that the expression of the p <dig> vsrs-protein is the main cause of the yield reduction also in the virus-infected plants.

surprisingly, the plants did not show any major phenotype alterations although the up-regulated transcripts included several developmentally important transcription factors, such as those coding for the scarecrow, leafy <dig>  ap <dig> and gras/della –type, or nac, nam , myb and mads domain containing transcription factors, or the waf-protein of the auxin response factor family. also several development-related genes coding for embryo-abundant, senescence associated, ripening responsive or storage proteins were strongly enhanced.

the most significant groups of the up-regulated genes were those associated with various biotic and abiotic stresses, including numerous disease resistances, pathogen induced and systemic resistance  related transcripts, as well as transcripts for heavy metal, draught, and osmotic stress tolerance. these appeared to be induced in a coordinated fashion, via strong induction of the biosynthesis of their key signaling factors, i.e. sa, et and ja  <cit> . induction of these regulatory pathways via silencing suppressor function indicated that they are regulated via rna-silencing, as previously shown for ja  <cit> . the strong activation of the multiple disease defense genes in these plants was associated with a clearly enhanced hr reaction to invading bacteria, as compared to wild type plants.

one important effect of the p <dig> protein was the strong enhancement of numerous signaling-related transcripts, which all play a significant role in regulation of gene expression and in various enzyme activities. important examples of these are the map <dig>  mk <dig> and map kinase kinases which mediate the signaling cascade downstream of the primary defense response factors   <cit> . of special interest in this group is the enhancement of the transcript of the rgs-cam gene which itself acts as a suppressor of rna silencing in the tobacco  <cit> . its up-regulation in these transgenic plants raises the possibility of its involvement in the silencing suppression mechanism of p <dig> vsrs.

surprisingly, the strong induction of multiple transcripts did not affect the level of total soluble protein content, and no significant or consistent alterations were either observed in the protein profile of the transgenic plants, as compared to wild type plants . apparently the general enhancement on transcript accumulation was effectively counter-balanced by increased protein degradation, as indicated by the strong increase of multiple transcripts related to different proteolytic pathways . lack of any distinct phenotype in the p25-expressing plants is consistent with the  stable protein profile of the plants, and these both indicate that the homeostasis in the plants is maintained via complicated interplay and interactions between different regulatory levels. the enhanced level of multiple ubiquitin-related transcripts indicates that the regulatory network involves enhanced proteosomal degradation of proteins . proper proteosomal function has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of plant health and homeostasis  <cit> .

in contrast to the stable phenotype of the p25-expressing plants, two other vsrs-transgenes  cause severely altered phenotypes in transgenic tobacco plants  <cit> . interestingly, alterations observed in the transcriptomes of the p25-expressing plants were quite different from those observed either in the hc-pro or ac <dig> vsrs expressing transgenic plants, as p <dig> caused predominantly only up-regulation of the transcripts, and affected much larger number of transcripts, with an overlap of only  <dig> altered transcripts between these three vsrss. this comparison reveals that some of the genes that were differently affected in these lines were the causal factors for the severe developmental disturbances and phenotypes observed in the hc-pro and ac <dig> expressing lines.

functional mechanisms of the p <dig> induced effects
p <dig> vsrs is known to interfere with the ago <dig>  the central component of the risc complex, and mediate its degradation through the proteosomal pathway  <cit> . defects of the proper ago <dig> function or expression are known to compromise all dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig> mediated silencing activities, and depending on the type of ago  <dig> mutant allele, may severely disturb the development of the plant  <cit> . in our transgenic plants the expression of p <dig> – with assumed disturbance of the ago <dig> protein – had a strong effect of the transcriptome, but hardly any effect on the plant phenotype. this may be related to previously reported phenomenon that the ago <dig> mutants affect the silencing of some, but not of all of mirna-target genes  <cit> . also in our p25-expressing transgenic plants, strong up-regulation was observed in some silencing-targeted genes e.g. in the defense-, signaling- and metabolism-related target transcripts, and in transcripts of many transcription factors with nac, nam, leafy, myb or scarecrow domains, while no alterations occurred in other typical silencing targets, such as various auxin response factors, dcl <dig> or ago <dig>  or in other transcription factors that regulate the developmental differentiation  <cit> .

ago <dig> itself is known to be regulated by silencing–mediated pathways, and particularly via the function of the mir <dig>  this effector molecule, as well as ago1-derived sirnas and their amplification loop mediated by dcl <dig>  dcl <dig>  rdr <dig>  sde <dig> and sgs <dig> are known to maintain the homeostasis of the ago <dig> protein  <cit> . another vsrs, i.e. the p <dig> derived from turnip crinkle virus, also disturbs the ago <dig>  <cit> . likewise with the p <dig>  this vsrs does not induce any specific phenotype alterations when expressed in transgenic arabidopsis plants, although it - unlike with p <dig> - causes major disturbances to the silencing machinery via strong enhancement of the dcl <dig> and consequent  suppression of dcl  <dig> and dcl <dig>  <cit> . in that case, the regulatory interactions reveal an intensive regulatory network that serves to maintain the homeostasis of the silencing machinery  <cit> . in the p <dig> expressing transgenic plants such network was not induced, as the expression levels of the dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> or dcl  <dig> were not changed, revealing no explanation for the stabilizing mechanism in these plants.

one interesting feature is the tissue-specific regulation of the ago1-mediated silencing pathways, as widely discussed by voinnet  <cit> . it has been reported that the ago <dig> mutants do not cause defects in apical meristems  <cit> , and thus the p25-specific silencing suppression effect, mediated via ago <dig> suppression, may not be effective in this tissue. also the work of faivre-rampant and co-workers  <cit>  suggests that pvx-p <dig> protein functions in an organ-specific fashion, with different silencing suppression effects in leaves and tubers. in our study, the p25-transgene had massive effects on the transcriptomes of the leaves, but minimal effects in the flowers, although the gene was expressed on equal level in both organs. particularly strong silencing-mediated regulatory and surveillance mechanisms are known to operate in the plant meristems  <cit> , and it is possible that the tissue-specific mechanisms prevent the disturbance of the ago <dig> function in this tissue, to maintain the developmental integrity of the plants. the balancing mechanisms that modulate the ago <dig> function and maintain cellular homeostasis in different organs need further investigation. the question of the regulatory mechanism that are responsible for the plant homeostasis and the maintenance of the stable protein profile in the p25-expressing plants remains open.

CONCLUSIONS
results of this study indicate that the expression of the pvx-derived p <dig> vsrs in transgenic tobacco plants leads to enhanced accumulation of numerous transcripts  in the leaves, but changes the levels of only a few transcripts in the flowers of these plants. in spite of the massive changes in the transcriptome, the protein profile of the leaves remains fairly stable, and no major changes are observed in the phenotype of the plants, except for slightly reduced growth and the strong induction of biotic and abiotic stress indicators. based on the alterations observed in different transcripts, we conclude that the maintenance of homeostasis in these plants involves enhanced proteosomal degradation of proteins. lack of phenotype alterations may also relate to the organ-specific effects of the p <dig> vsrs, which occur in leaves but not in flowers. it is possible that the developmentally sensitive meristematic tissues are not venerable for these effects.
