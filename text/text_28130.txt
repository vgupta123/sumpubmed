BACKGROUND
understanding resistance to disease is a major concern for all living organisms. thus, it is necessary to design strategies to address related questions according to scientific and economic contexts. in farm animals like pig, zootechnical performances including growth, meat quality, feed intake or prolificacy have increased considerably during the last  <dig> years as a result of both the application of rational genetic selection schemes  <cit> , and the improvement of feed formulations and sanitary conditions in breeding units. however at the same time, diseases have emerged that can cause substantial economic loss. intensive research is carried out to better understand the etiology of emerging as well as endemic diseases in pig and raises questions on host pathogen interactions, pathogen latency, pathogen shedding, vaccine efficiency and host immune response. thus, producing efficient methods and tools for these studies and improving basic knowledge on immune response in pig are major issues.

with the explosion of information on genome sequences and the emergence of functional genomics, it is now possible to study the expression of many genes in a single experiment. the development of dna chips for genome-wide expression studies  <cit>  and the next generation sequencing  technology for much deeper transcriptome analyses  <cit>  are complementary approaches to conduct functional genomics research  <cit> . dna chip-based transcriptome analyses are efficient to study host-pathogen interactions using either pathogen transcriptomes  <cit>  or host transcriptomes  <cit>  or both pathogen and host modifications of the transcriptome during infection  <cit> . thus, dna chips are still highly valuable to analyze large numbers of samples and in the case of domestic animals, it is essential to develop well-annotated dna chips and sequence-based transcriptome using the ngs technology.

one major concern in designing a dna chip-based experiment is to use the most appropriate and relevant array. for human and laboratory animals like mouse, the genomes are almost fully annotated, thus chips representing all the annotated genes are commercially available. in pig, the genome sequence is in progress and a first assembly has been released  <cit> . today, many commercial and custom-made genome-wide microarrays exist for pig but probe annotation of these arrays is still poor because of the limited availability of full length cdna sequences in pig  <cit> . available porcine dna chips include a  <dig> k cdna-based microarray on nylon membranes  <cit> , a  <dig> dna/cdna microarray including a subset of probes specific for the sla locus, a subset of immune response genes outside the sla complex, and a subset of randomly chosen probes  <cit> , the ark-genomics sus scrofa immune array  <dig> k v <dig>   <cit> , the sus scrofa aros  v <dig>  , the genechipÂ® porcine genome array , a  <dig> k porcine long-oligonuclotide dna microarray  <cit> , and the swine protein-annotated oligonucleotide microarray  <cit> . the immune system represents a complex network involving many regulation points and the genome-wide generic arrays that have been developed in pig only partially cover the genome and lack many immune response genes. as an example, the major histocompatibility complex , which plays a key role in innate, adaptive immune response as well as in inflammation in mammals, is only poorly represented on existing pig expression arrays.

the objectives of our study were first to produce a generic array enriched in mhc and immunity-related genes and second to study transcriptome modifications of porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells  after in vitro stimulation of the immune response. we describe the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip that combines the generic qiagen-nrsp8-13k set  <cit>  with a long-oligonucleotide set comprising all the genes and pseudogenes annotated for the pig mhc referred to as the sla  complex as well as immune response genes outside the sla complex. we report the use of this array to investigate the differential expression of genes in pbmcs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide  or a mixture of phorbol myristate acetate  and ionomycin for  <dig> hours. lps is part of the outermost layer of gram-negative bacteria and is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern  used for in vitro studies of the innate immune response after bacterial infection. pma, a phorbol diester, is a potent tumor promoter often used in biomedical research to activate the signal transduction enzyme protein kinase c and a potent mitogen for pbmcs. ionomycin is a ionophore that stimulates the intracellular production of the cytokines il- <dig> and il- <dig> in conjunction with pma. both these stimulations with either lps or pma/ionomycin were chosen because they are widely used to stimulate immune response in vitro. our results show that some biological pathways and gene networks are differentially expressed in pbmcs according to stimulation. they provide new data on pig immunity and validate the relevance of the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip for further studies on immunity and immune response to stimuli and pathogens in pig.

RESULTS
design of the porcine sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip
the porcine chip referred to as sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip includes a newly designed sla-ri oligonucleotide set, the qiagen-nrsp <dig> microarray oligonucleotide set  <cit>  and a series of positive and negative control elements . to prepare the sla oligonucleotide subset, we selected the  <dig> genes and pseudogenes annotated in the sla complex. this set comprises  <dig> probes:  <dig> probes in sense orientation and  <dig> probes in anti-sense orientation. the ri subset comprises  <dig> probes of which  <dig> are designed from pig sequences and  <dig> from human sequences. the detailed information on probes and on gene ontology  is summarized in the additional files  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the sla-ri set was uploaded into the animal qtl database  <cit>  in order to visualize probes on existing porcine maps. therefore, the position of probes from both sla-ri and nrsp8-13k sets can be visualized via the qtldb web viewer.

differentially expressed genes in pbmcs stimulated with lps or pma/ionomycin
transcriptome analyses were carried out using a dye-swap hybridization scheme to compare gene expressions between mock-stimulated pbmcs and pbmcs stimulated with either lps or a mixture of pma and ionomycin during  <dig> hours. comparison of lps stimulated and mock-stimulated pbmcs, revealed  <dig> differentially expressed probes  among which  <dig> originated from the sla-ri set  and  <dig> from the nrsp8-13k set . up-regulation was observed for  <dig> probes  and down-regulation for  <dig> probes . comparison of pma/ionomycin stimulated and mock-stimulated pbmcs, revealed  <dig> differentially expressed probes  among which  <dig> originated from the sla-ri set  and  <dig> from the nrsp8-13k set . up-regulation was observed for  <dig> probes  and down-regulation for  <dig> probes . thus about ten times more genes are differentially expressed in pma/ionomycin stimulated pbmcs than in lps stimulated pbmcs. with both stimulation agents, more genes were up-regulated than down-regulated. we observed six go annotations specific to pma/ionomycin stimulation but only one specific to lps stimulation . comparison of the top-ten differentially expressed genes between the two stimulations applied , found no common up-regulated gene, but five common down-regulated genes namely lysozyme , fibronectin  <dig> , folate receptor  <dig> , cystatin c  and cystatin sa .

overview and comparison of affected biological functions in pbmcs during lps or pma/ionomycin stimulation
three hundred and sixty-four genes from the  <dig> differentially expressed probes after lps stimulation were mapped into the ingenuity pathway analysis  system and  <dig> network eligible genes and  <dig> function eligible genes were found. three thousand five hundred and sixty-eight genes from the  <dig> differentially expressed probes found between mock-stimulated and pma/ionomycin-stimulated pbmcs, were also mapped in the ipa system, leading to the identification of  <dig> network eligible genes and  <dig> function eligible genes. the numbers of molecules in each category of biological functions related to the different catalogs are given in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  in the catalog diseases and disorders,  <dig> and  <dig> biological function categories are covered respectively for lps and pma/ionomycin stimulations. the number of represented biological function categories after pma/ionomycin stimulation is considerably reduced in comparison to lps stimulation despite four times more differentially expressed genes. the two most represented biological function categories are common to both stimulations and concern first cancer and second immunological diseases . in the catalog molecular and cellular function,  <dig> and  <dig> biological function categories are covered respectively for lps and pma/ionomycin stimulations. the two most represented biological function categories are first cellular growth and proliferation and second cell death. in the case of lps stimulation, some biological function categories are missing among which cellular assembly and organization, cellular function and maintenance and functions related to dna replication, rna modification and protein expression . in the catalog physiological system development and function ,  <dig> and  <dig> biological function categories are covered respectively for lps and pma/ionomycin stimulations. the three most represented functions are common to both stimulations and include immune system, hematological system development and function and immune and lymphatic system development and function. the function referred to as organismal survival is covered by a large set of  <dig> genes differentially expressed after pma/ionomycin stimulation but is missing in the gene set differentially expressed after lps stimulation. on the whole, after lps stimulation, the relative representation of each catalog is 47% for disease and disorder, 30% for molecular and cellular functions and 23% for physiological system development and function while after pma/ionomycin stimulation, the representation is 36% for disease and disorder, 43% for molecular and cellular functions and 21% for physiological system development and function. these results show that the predominant genes after lps stimulation are those related to disease and disorder while after pma/ionomycin stimulation, the most represented genes are related to molecular and cellular functions.

lps-related gene networks
thirteen lps-related gene networks with scores over  <dig> were built by the ipa system . significant gene networks specific to lps stimulation are presented in figure  <dig>  the lps-related network  <dig> was attributed the highest score  and groups  <dig> differentially expressed genes, among which  <dig> and four genes are up- and down-regulated, respectively . this network is associated with various functions including cell death, immunological disease and molecular transport and covers canonical pathways, such as protein ubiquitination and antigen presentation pathways. this network represents an image of the up-regulation of proteasome activity and peptide processing in relationship to heat shock protein induction. the lps-related network  <dig> groups  <dig> differentially expressed genes, among which  <dig> and seven genes are up- and down-regulated, respectively . in this network, il1b is in the central position together with il1a and cxcl <dig>  ligand 3). this network contains cd <dig> antigen , cd <dig> antigen , and cd <dig> antigen known to be a ligand of cd <dig> as well as tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  the lps-related network  <dig> is an image of the global up-regulation of the cd14-induced cascade and cytokine signaling pathways related to steps specific to innate immune response after lps stimulation in association to a down-regulation of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig>  the lps-related network  <dig> consists of  <dig> differentially expressed genes, among which  <dig> and five are up- and down-regulated, respectively . the network is associated with functions linked to immunological disease, cancer, renal and urological diseases, and concerns a series of six canonical pathways, including purine metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, il- <dig> signaling, hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate activation and leukocyte extravasation signaling. the map kinase map <dig> , the matrix metallopeptidases  <dig> and  <dig> , the transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  are in central positions in this network, which groups up-regulated genes involved in intracellular biochemistry modifications and in remodeling.

complementary information on gene pathways and on interactions between pathways was retrieved using the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes   <cit> . after lps stimulation,  <dig> significant pathways with a fisher exact p-value <  <dig>  were identified . the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway is the most representative pathway followed by antigen processing and presentation and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. interactions between pathways with their relative importance are presented in figure 5a. fourteen pathways are interconnected and only adipocyte signaling and bladder cancer pathways are not connected to the other pathways.

pma/ionomycin-related gene networks
ninety-eight pma/ionomycin-related biological networks with a score higher than  <dig> were built by the ipa system . a limited number of the most interesting networks is shown on figure  <dig>  in the pma/ionomycin-related network  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> genes are up- and down-regulated, respectively. tumor necrosis factor  is significantly over-expressed after pma/ionomycin stimulation and occupies the most central position in the network. the network is linked with numerous functions including cellular development, cellular growth and proliferation, hematological system development and function and concerns about  <dig> canonical pathways representative of the pleiotropic activities of tnf. since most pathways were identified by a single gene , it was not possible to connect this tnf-centered network with a specific biological function or pathway modified by pma/ionomycin stimulation. thus, we searched for networks with canonical pathways related to more than one or two genes. network  <dig>  groups  <dig> down-regulated genes, including tlr genes , myeloid differentiation primary response gene  <dig> , interleukin- <dig> , receptor-associated kinases  and il <dig> receptors . network  <dig> also contains  <dig> up-regulated genes that comprise members of the tnf-receptor superfamily  and ras-associated proteins such as rab <dig>  the non-differentially expressed p38mapk gene occupies the central position and connects the down-regulation of the tlr pathway to the up-regulation of tnf receptors and vesicular transport. network  <dig>  comprises  <dig> down-regulated genes mostly associated to mhc class i presentation and interferon signaling pathways, and  <dig> up-regulated genes including genes involved in peptide processing before loading onto class i molecules . the most up-regulated gene i.e. cd <dig> is found in this network and could be connected to the most down-regulated gene thbs <dig> from network  <dig> and to cd <dig>  therefore, the network presented in figure 6c clearly connects the strong up-regulation of a cell surface glycoprotein involved in lymphocyte proliferation and known to act as a signal-transmitting receptor in lymphocytes, natural killer  cells, and platelets  <cit>  and the very strong down-regulation of thbs <dig> that is an adhesive glycoprotein involved in cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. moreover, this network provides evidence for the co-existence of an up-regulation of genes involved in peptide processing and a down-regulation of genes involved in antigen presentation to the cell surface.

after pma/ionomycin stimulation,  <dig> kegg pathways with a fisher exact p-value <  <dig>  were identified . the most represented pathways are cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, cell adhesion molecules , jak-stat signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and cell cycle. the toll-like receptor signaling pathway occupies the eighth position with  <dig> genes. interactions between pathways with their relative importance are presented in figure 5b. globally, pma-ionomycin stimulation mostly modifies pathways associated with the immune system, signaling molecules and interactions, human diseases and metabolism like lps stimulation but it also affects additional pathways associated to metabolism, cell growth and death and signal transduction.

expression of probes mapping to the sla complex
since sense and antisense probes for all sla annotated transcripts were present on the dna chip , it was possible to perform an in-depth analysis of the expression profile of all annotated transcripts mapping to the locus. for probes targeting protein coding genes, only the differential expression was studied. for antisense and non-coding transcripts, expression and differential expression between stimulation and mock-stimulation were both analyzed.

all the differentially expressed genes belonging to the mhc antigenic processing and presentation pathway are listed in table  <dig>  after lps stimulation, all the genes associated with the mhc class ii mediated peptide presentation pathway are down-regulated. the down-regulated genes include genes involved in peptide processing in the late endosome , peptide loading  and peptide presentation to the cd <dig> t cells . after pma/ionomycin stimulation, a similar down-regulation of mhc class ii mediated peptide presentation pathway is observed. in contrast, for the mhc class i mediated peptide presentation pathway, all genes involved in peptide processing and transport  are up-regulated whereas probes targeting the classical class i genes sla- <dig>  the non classical class i genes sla- <dig> and sla- <dig> as well as pseudogenes sla- <dig> and sla- <dig> are down-regulated.

in order to analyze anti-sense oligonucleotide and non-coding rna probe expression, the a value )) was used. since the average a value of probes corresponding to negative controls was  <dig> , probes were considered as expressed for a values higher than  <dig>  that corresponded to signal intensities twice as high as for the controls. with such a threshold, about 30% of the anti-sense oligonucleotide probes were found expressed. after lps stimulation,  <dig> probes corresponding to anti-sense sequences derived from  <dig> genes are expressed. after pma/ionomycin stimulation,  <dig> probes corresponding to anti-sense sequences from  <dig> genes are expressed among which  <dig> are expressed by pbmcs in both stimulation conditions. anti-sense sequences of eight genes , sla- <dig> and sla-dob) are specifically expressed in lps-stimulated pbmcs. for non-coding rna, sense probes targeting mir- <dig>  and snornau <dig> are expressed by pbmcs stimulated by lps or pma/ionomycin and the anti-sense probe targeting snornau <dig>  is specifically expressed in lps-stimulated pbmcs. differential analysis revealed that no non-coding rna is differentially expressed whatever the stimulation and that antisense probes are regulated only after pma/ionomycin stimulation. four probes are up-regulated  and nine probes are down-regulated .

validation of differentially expressed genes at the rna level
differential expression of  <dig> genes  was validated by quantitative real-time pcr  and the b2m gene was included as a reference gene for data normalization. in order to strengthen the comparison between both technologies, qrt-pcrs were carried out using the rna samples that were used for microarray experiments and the fold change was calculated for both microarray and qrt-pcr data . for mhc mediated peptide presentation, five genes involved in the peptide processing and presentation by mhc class i molecules  and three genes involved in the processing and presentation of antigens by mhc class ii molecules  were chosen. three genes cst <dig>  lyz and ppia were chosen for validation because they were differentially expressed in opposite directions after lps or pma/ionomycin stimulation. il1a was chosen because it was differentially expressed only after lps stimulation and inversely, cd <dig> and tnfrsf <dig> were chosen because they were differentially expressed only after pma/ionomycin stimulation. differential expression was confirmed for all genes and the log <dig> calculated with the qrt-pcr data consistently showed a greater magnitude of change compared to the log <dig> calculated with the microarray data. a highly significant correlation  was calculated between the two techniques .

validation of differentially expressed genes at the protein level
supernatants of mock-stimulated pbmcs and pbmcs stimulated with lps or pma/ionomycin for  <dig> hours were collected to measure cytokines il- <dig>  il- <dig>  tnfa and il-1b by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  tests. gene expression between mock-stimulation and each stimulation condition assessed by the fold change was calculated for both microarray and elisa data . significant increased expression of il <dig>  il <dig>  tnfa and il1b proteins  were detected after both stimulations and confirmed up-regulation for il <dig> and il1b at the rna level after lps stimulation and up-regulation of il <dig>  il <dig> and tnfa at the rna level after pma/ionomycin stimulation. high discrepancies were observed between rna and protein levels for il <dig>  il <dig>  tnf and il1b. for lps stimulation, rna levels of il <dig> and tnfa were not significantly different between mock-stimulated and stimulated cells in contrast to the protein levels. similarly, for pma/ionomycin stimulation, rna level of il1b was not significantly up-regulated in contrast to the protein level. such discrepancies could be due to underestimation of rna levels due to the sensitivity scale of the transcriptome analysis or to specific properties of the proteins including lability, half life time, differences in release timing, and accumulation of the released proteins in the supernatants.

1ns: not significant at p value <  <dig> .

differential expression of mhc class i and class ii molecules was validated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting . facs analysis confirmed a significant down-regulation of mhc class i molecules at the surface of pbmcs stimulated with pma/ionomycin for  <dig> hours compared to mock-stimulated pbmcs. the mhc class i mean fluorescence intensity of pbmcs after pma/ionomycin stimulation was  <dig> % of that of mock-stimulated pbmcs . as expected from microarray results, no change in mhc class i molecule expression was detected at the surface of lps stimulated pbmcs for  <dig> hours. in contrast, mhc class ii molecules were found down-regulated at the surface of pbmcs in both stimulation conditions compared to mock-stimulated cells. the mhc class ii mean fluorescence intensity of lps-stimulated pbmcs was  <dig> % of that of mock-stimulated pbmcs  and  <dig> % of that of mock-stimulated pbmcs  after pma/ionomycin stimulation.

discussion
the objectives of this study were first to produce a well annotated and an easy to use dna chip to analyze the immune response in pig and second to validate its relevance by investigating transcriptome modifications in pbmcs stimulated with lps or pma/ionomycin for  <dig> hours. the same seven biological replicates from seven distinct animals were used for transcriptome analysis, qrt-pcr and elisa validation, and another set of seven animals was used for validation by facs analysis. reproducibility of the results was good.

relevance of the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip
dna chips targeting immunity have been reported for human, mouse and a few domestic species including cow  <cit> , chicken  <cit>  and to a lesser extent pig with a unique report of a nylon membrane comprising less than  <dig> genes  <cit> . designing dedicated chips may be criticized because it is contradictory to the global approach that underlies a transcriptome study. since no genome-wide expression array exists for pig and since efficient tools are required to study immunity and resistance to disease, we have constructed a generic array enriched in immunity genes. we combined a well-annotated oligonucleotide set referred to as the nrsp8-13k set that partially covers the pig genome  <cit>  to a set of oligonucleotides referred to as the sla-ri set that targets all annotated loci within the sla complex and immunity genes outside the sla complex. here, we report that after lps stimulation, among  <dig> differentially expressed genes ,  <dig> were common to both the generic and the sla-ri sets and  <dig> were present only in the sla-ri set. similarly, after pma/ionomycin stimulation, among  <dig> differentially expressed genes,  <dig> were present in both sets and  <dig> were present only in the sla-ri set. the sla-ri set was highly informative for the analyses reported here. the sla-ri set may be merged with any other generic set and it is anticipated that the number of overlapping probes between sets should increase as a function of the genome coverage in the next generation expression arrays. the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip was shown to be suitable to identify immunity and disease-related biological pathways and functions as well as to construct relevant gene networks. validation of differential expression was carried out for several genes at the rna level by qrt-pcr and at the protein level by elisa tests or facs analysis. the results show significant correlations between mrna and protein expression levels, confirming the accuracy of the chip annotation. dna chips for expression studies are currently replaced by sequence-based transcriptome using the ngs technology, suggesting that the design of genome-wide dna chips could be skipped and that sequencing could be used directly for transcriptome analysis. however, concentrating all efforts on the ngs technology might hamper the analysis of numerous animals and samples as required for eqtl studies and genetic genomics  <cit> . we are quite convinced that the ngs technology and well-annotated dna chips will remain complementary for a while in domestic species. the sla-ri/nrsp8-13k chip reported here represents an accurately annotated chip dedicated to the pig immune system and will provide a valuable tool for diagnostics and research.

choice of the in vitro models to study immune response activation
pma, also known as 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , is a potent tumor promoter often used in biomedical research  <cit> . ionomycin is an ionophore produced by streptomyces conglobatus. pma in conjunction with ionomycin is known to activate t and b cells and has been used in numerous immune-related studies  <cit> . lps is a major structural component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and is a well-referenced pamp. lps stimulation of mammalian cells occurs through a series of interactions with proteins including lps binding protein, cd <dig>  md- <dig> and tlr <dig>  <cit> . lps is one of the best studied immunostimulatory components of bacteria and can induce systemic inflammation and sepsis if excessive signals occur  <cit> . lps-stimulation mimics a bacterial infection and has been extensively used to study innate immune response  <cit> . two recent studies in pig have reported transcriptome modifications in mesenteric lymph node or spleen after infection by salmonella enterica serovar choleraesuis   <cit>  and haemophilus parasuis   <cit> , respectively. s. choleraesuis and h. parasuis are both gram-negative bacteria. our results on lps-stimulation reveal that many genes already identified after in vivo infection by s. choleraesuis and h. parasuis are up- or down-regulated confirming that in vitro lps activation of pbmcs is a good model to study innate immune response to infection with gram negative bacteria in pig.

indeed, lps and pma/ionomycin stimulations were chosen because they are widely used as gold standard in vitro models to measure cytokines released in the medium by pbmcs in many species. a unique time point was studied and we are aware that all the results reported here correspond to this unique time point i.e.  <dig> hours after stimulation. it has been reported that time points earlier than  <dig> hours are more relevant to decipher the onset of the response to stimulus as shown in kinetics studies in cow  <cit> , pig  <cit> , mouse  <cit>  or human  <cit> . moreover, kinetics studies have revealed that many genes return to their basal expression level by  <dig> hours of stimulation, suggesting that homeostasis is restored at that time  <cit> . in this report, we were interested in studying the pbmc transcriptome at the time when cytokines released in the medium are efficiently measured. our results provide many candidate genes to test for kinetics studies and ongoing complementary studies focus on this topic.

significant positive correlations have been reported between transcriptomes of total pbmcs and purified monocytes stimulated with lps, suggesting that for studies focussing on the most differentially expressed genes, separating and analysing cell subpopulations may be unnecessary  <cit> . therefore, the results reported here correspond to the most striking transcriptome modifications during immune response activation and may miss some subtle changes that occur in each cell subtype. identifying transcriptome modifications occurring in each cell subtype is a major objective to better decipher immune response. however, transcriptomic signatures of blood or total pbmcs are of high interest in clinical research and most studies relate to total pbmcs in pig  <cit> .

specific transcriptome modifications after lps stimulation
almost half of the transcriptome modifications due to lps stimulation are related to disease and disorder biological function . most of the up-regulated genes relate to inflammation and innate immune response, as expected. saa <dig> and pro-inflammatory chemokines il <dig>  ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> belong to the top-ten most up-regulated genes , saa <dig> being the most up-regulated gene with a 27-fold change by comparison to mock-stimulated pbmcs. saa <dig> encodes the major acute-phase protein serum amyloid a , the precise role of which is still unclear despite reports suggesting a key role in the establishment and maintenance of inflammation notably as an antiapoptotic agent for neutrophils  <cit>  and as an opsonin that would facilitate phagocytosis of gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . saa <dig> was also found as the most up-regulated gene in spleen seven days after infection by h. parasuis  <cit> . the chemokines il <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> have chemotaxis for neutrophils whereas the chemokines ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> have a broader chemotaxis spectrum specific for t, dendritic and nk cells as well as monocytes and basophils  <cit> . up-regulation of il <dig> has already been reported in pig pbmcs  <cit>  and amnion  <cit>  after bacterial infection. in human, stimulation of pbmcs with lps induces the secretion of ccl <dig>  <cit> , cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  <cit> . cxcl <dig> is up-regulated in lps-challenged bovine mammary epithelial cells  <cit> . all these results confirm the essential role of chemokines in chemoattraction and cell guidance to the site of infection during bacterial infection. il <dig> has been reported to activate chemokine production  <cit> . in our study, we found that il <dig> was moderately up-regulated after  <dig> hours of stimulation and that it occupies a central position in the lps-related network  <dig> providing a global image of inflammation activation .

we have also found other strongly up-regulated genes after lps stimulation including sod <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> are members of the s <dig> family, which encodes proteins containing two ef-hand calcium-binding motifs and are involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. in human, s100a <dig> has been reported to be up-regulated in lps-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting that this gene has a role in innate immune defense. sod <dig>  is a member of the iron/manganese superoxide dismutase family and it has been shown to be up-regulated in dendritic cells after lps stimulation  <cit> . these results suggest that the calcium pathways as well as oxidative processes are strongly affected in lps stimulated pbmcs. interestingly, the six genes s100a <dig>  cxcl <dig>  s100a <dig>  il <dig> cxcl <dig> and sod <dig> were also found strongly up-regulated in mesenteric lymph nodes of pigs infected by s. choleraesuis  <cit>  and s100a <dig>  s100a <dig> and sod <dig> were also up-regulated in spleen after h. parasuis infection  <cit> . overall these results confirm a predominant role of common genes in the innate immune response of pig to gram-negative bacterial infections.

by examining the top-ten most up-regulated genes  and the representation of kegg pathways , we have found that after pma/ionomycin stimulation, t cells are more activated than b cells. three of the most up-regulated genes are il <dig> , cd <dig>  and tnfrsf <dig> , which are related to t cell activation. b cell markers such as cd <dig> and inhba are also up-regulated  but with fold changes of  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. it has been reported that transcription of the cytokine il <dig> is the main consequence of t cell activation and that il <dig> is produced by t helper cells harboring a th <dig> cytokine profile  <cit> . il <dig> is essential for the generation and regulation of immune response. binding of il <dig> activates the ras/mapk, jak/stat and pi 3-kinase/akt signaling module pathways . il <dig> signals through the il <dig> receptor and in this study, we have found that the interleukin  <dig> receptor alpha  is also up-regulated after pma/ionomycin stimulation as previously reported  <cit> . the il-2/il-2r interaction stimulates the growth, differentiation and survival of antigen-selected cytotoxic t cells  <cit> . the activation of t lymphocytes, both in vivo and in vitro, induces expression of cd <dig> that has been reported as the earliest inducible cell surface glycoprotein acquired during lymphoid activation. this molecule is involved in lymphocyte proliferation and functions as a signal-transmitting receptor in lymphocytes, natural killer cells and platelets  <cit> . tnfrsf <dig> also known as 4-1bb is a member of the tnf-receptor superfamily and is a cd4+ t cell marker that regulates cd <dig> co-stimulation to promote th <dig> cell response. the expression of this receptor is induced by lymphocyte activation and is involved in t cell division and expansion  <cit> . in agreement with these findings, il12b that is known to trigger th <dig> response is also found up-regulated with a limited fold change of  <dig> . globally, our results show a strong up-regulation of cytokines and genes related to th <dig> response, suggesting a more pronounced activation of the th <dig> response compared to a th <dig> response after pma/ionomycin stimulation for  <dig> hours.

strikingly, a very strong down-regulation of the thbs <dig> gene was observed after pma/ionomycin stimulation for  <dig> hours with a reduced expression of  <dig> fold change by comparison to mock-stimulation . this gene is also down-regulated in porcine aortic endothelial cells treated with pma  <cit>  and in bovine pbmcs stimulated with concanavalin a  <cit> . interestingly, thbs <dig> down-regulation has been shown to become stronger with time after concanavalin a stimulation in bovine pbmcs  <cit> , suggesting a persistent role of this gene repression during immune activation and a delayed response or no response for returning to pre-induction levels. thbs <dig> encodes an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. thbs <dig> has been described with many diverse functions that may relate to its structure and consequently to its ability to bind to matrix proteins, cell surface receptors or other molecules including cytokines  <cit> . thbs <dig> is known as a potent natural inhibitor of angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration  <cit> . thbs <dig> has been shown to be regulated by dna methylation and to be a target for a transcription repression induced by the protein arginine methyltransferase  <dig> . our work suggests that the strong repression of thbs <dig> observed in pig pbmcs may be due to methylation and that the prmt <dig> gene may have a role in this repression. interestingly, cd <dig>  which encodes a membrane protein that is a receptor for the c-terminal cell binding domain of thbs <dig>  <cit>  was also found slightly down-regulated . recent findings suggest that thbs <dig> contributes to the vascular system regulation by acting via its receptor cd <dig> to inhibit nitric oxide signaling  <cit> . our findings suggest a major role of thbs <dig> repression in t/b cell activation upon stimulation with pma/ionomycin, by enhancing the ability of cells to proliferate and migrate. whether this role is connected to cd <dig> or to other receptors has to be further investigated.

our study confirms an up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il <dig> but has not found an over-expression of ifng as previously reported by ledger et al.  <cit> .

down-regulation of mhc mediated antigen presentation pathways after both stimulations
a strong down-regulation of mhc class ii or mhc class i and ii molecules was observed after lps or pma/ionomycin stimulation, respectively. classical class ii molecules are involved in antigen presentation to cd4+ t cells whereas classical class i genes have a double function of antigen presentation to cd8+ t cells and regulation of natural killer cell cytotoxicity by interacting with nk receptors such as nkg2d  <cit> . in pig, down-regulation of mhc genes has been reported in vivo in the spleen of animals infected by h. parasuis  <cit>  and in vitro in pk <dig> cells infected by the pseudorabies virus  <cit>  and in pbmcs stimulated with pma/ionomycin  <cit> . in human, such a repression has also been reported in pbmcs infected by bacterial lps and diverse killed bacteria  <cit> . our results show that the repression program includes classical  and non classical  sla class ii genes after lps and pma/ionomycin stimulation as reported in human pbmcs. in addition, classical class i genes corresponding to sla- <dig> and likely to sla- <dig> and sla- <dig> are also repressed together with the non classical genes sla- <dig> and sla- <dig>  <cit>  that map to the sla complex on chromosome  <dig> and cd <dig> that maps to chromosome  <dig> thus outside of the mhc locus. strikingly, in our study, after pma/ionomycin stimulation, biological networks connect the down-regulation of mhc class i molecules to a significant increase in transcription of numerous heat shock proteins known to act as chaperones as well as in transcription of all genes involved in the cascade of peptide processing before loading to the mhc molecule binding groove.

induction of mhc class i expression is mainly transcriptional and promoters of class i genes contain ifn-stimulated response elements  that bind factors of the ifn regulatory factor  family. therefore, expression of irfs influences transcription of class i genes. in our study, irf <dig> and irf <dig> are found up-regulated after pma/ionomycin stimulation in contrast to irf <dig> and irf <dig> that are repressed. irf8-mediated inhibition of antigen presentation by dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment has been described in human  <cit>  but our results are not in concordance with a possible role of irf <dig> in mhc class i repression since the repression in peptide presentation by class i molecules was linked with a down-regulation of irf <dig> together with a down-regulation of the peptide processing cascade  <cit> . in contrast, the down-regulation of irf <dig> is in agreement with a possible role of this gene in inhibiting transcription of mhc class i genes  <cit> .

comparison of transcriptomic signatures specific to lps and pma/ionomycin stimulations
in this study, about ten times more genes are found differentially expressed after pma/ionomycin than after lps stimulation. this might be related to the fact that lps targets monocytes and macrophages  <cit>  expressing cd <dig> and that pma/ionomycin have a much wider spectrum of target cells. however, it cannot be ruled out that the significant difference in the number of differentially expressed genes according to stimulation is due to variations in the dynamics of the response. the onset of response may occur much earlier for lps than for pma/ionomycin. as a counterpart, the return to basal levels of gene transcription may also occur earlier after lps stimulation, providing a possible hypothesis for a reduced number of differentially expressed genes after  <dig> hours stimulation. additional studies are required to specifically address this question.

specific and common features in transcriptome modifications were identified for both stimulations at  <dig> hours. strikingly, the most significant similarly regulated genes after both stimulations are found down-regulated and many specific genes appear to be up-regulated.

hierarchical clustering of genes found differentially expressed in both stimulation conditions provided a clear image of genes that were regulated either in the same direction or in opposite directions according to stimulation. in that respect, clusters c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  are the most informative to compare signatures and target possible markers that might be regulated in opposite directions according to stimulation. thbs <dig> , saa <dig>  chemokines ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig>  as well as il <dig> receptor, immunoglobulins and ltb  provide a limited subset of genes that are specifically up-regulated after lps stimulation and down-regulated after pma/ionomycin stimulation. similarly, cluster c <dig> including genes such as the chemokine cxcl <dig> and irf <dig> provides a reservoir of genes specifically up-regulated after pma/ionomycin stimulation and down-regulated after lps stimulation.

role of non-coding transcripts
after lps and pma/ionomycin stimulation, quite a high number of probes corresponding to annotated transcripts in the anti-sense orientation are expressed. it is likely that the expressed antisense probes correspond to either new non annotated transcripts or to antisense transcripts from annotated genes. interestingly, few of the anti-sense probes are differentially expressed after pma/ionomycin stimulation suggesting a role in immune response activation that has to be further explored. these preliminary results on the expression of non-coding transcripts mapping to the sla complex corresponds to a pilot study that would be worth extending to the whole genome.

CONCLUSIONS
we have designed a long-oligonucleotide set  comprising all the genes and pseudogenes annotated for the sla complex as well as immune response genes outside the sla complex and produced a generic array  enriched in immunity genes. we have assessed the relevance of this dna chip by investigating the response of porcine pbmcs to two distinct stimuli lps and pma/ionomycin. ours results reveal common as well as specific gene regulations according to stimulation, confirming some data already reported and providing new insights on the immune response in pig.
