BACKGROUND
hybridization and introgression are increasingly recognized as important factors in the evolution of plants, animals  <cit>  and prokaryotes  <cit> , and can lead to the creation of novel genotypes and phenotypes. thus, the study of contemporary hybridization between species and the extent of genomic introgression between them provides an excellent opportunity to examine evolutionary processes such as adaptation, gene flow and, ultimately, speciation  <cit> . determining the degree of genetic exchange between species may be of particular interest when studying recently diverged species, since they typically show incomplete reproductive barriers.

hybridization has an inherent spatial component, as the process requires direct contact between populations of the different species. for this reason, the spatial setting is a crucial determinant of hybridization, and, in turn, the specific conditions under which hybridization occurs can, sometimes, be inferred from the geographical distribution of hybrids. studies of hybrid zones have indicated that natural hybridization is most likely to take place in intermediate habitats, which are often found at the ecological limits of the species' distributional ranges, and where both taxa are found in close proximity to each other  <cit> . when some of the interspecific matings lead to fertile first-generation  hybrids, there is a possibility that these will backcross with at least one of the parental genotypes, with introgression as a consequence. if the resulting backcrossed individuals subsequently mate with the most similar parental genotype, novel genes and gene complexes can be particularly rapidly introduced into the new genetic background  <cit> . in some cases, stable and long-lasting hybrid zones are formed as a consequence of spatial range overlap between two species  <cit> . however, in the vast majority of cases, one of the two species, or possibly even the new hybrid cross, becomes more successful and displaces one or both of the original taxa  <cit> .

in odonates , a high level of hybridization between species is a rare phenomenon  <cit> . so far, only three molecular studies have investigated hybridization between closely related odonate species, namely between coenagrion puella and c. pulchellum  <cit> , mnais costalis and m. pruinosa  <cit>  and calopteryx splendens and c. virgo  <cit> . all these studies failed, however, to detect extensive hybridization between the species. there was no evidence of hybridization between coenagrion puella and c. pulchellum in any of the populations examined  <cit> , i.e. no hybrids were found. in addition, between mnais costalis and m. pruinosa only two f <dig> hybrid females were found among  <dig> individuals  <cit>  and between calopteryx splendens and c. virgo only seven hybrids out of  <dig> putative hybrids were detected  <cit> . despite the lack of evidence from molecular studies, observational and experimental studies have found evidence for putative intrageneric hybrids in some additional species  <cit> . for example, two of the best documented cases of hybridization among odonates are between ischnura gemina and i. denticollis  <cit> , and i. elegans and i. graellsii  <cit> .

the latter species pair consists of two closely related damselfly species that co-occur in southern europe  <cit> . specifically, i. graellsii is a widespread species on the iberian peninsula , while i. elegans is a species with a more northern and easterly distribution, which has recently spread into new regions within the iberian peninsula  <cit> . for example, the first record of i. elegans in north-west spain was made in  <dig>  whereas i. graellsii is known from this area since  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, i. elegans is the dominant species in the coastal lagoons of galicia , a region where it was a very rare species less than  <dig> years ago. furthermore, i. elegans is still rapidly expanding in the area, and in several coastal populations, that are dominated by i. graellsii, immigrant individuals of i. elegans are now starting to appear  <cit> . in a literature revision, monetti et al.  <cit>  have found that at least six spanish localities that held both species simultaneously before the 1980's, had only i. elegans in  <dig>  recent observations of i. elegans individuals in south spain , where only i. graellsii populations have been detected until now, and in western spain, support that this species is gradually expanding its distribution in southern latitudes and western longitudes. ischnura elegans has also expanded elsewhere; in the uk it has expanded its northern range by approximately  <dig> km in the last few decades, which is more than double than the average expansion distance of other odonates  <cit> . likewise, parmesan et al.  <cit>  showed that  <dig> of  <dig> european butterfly species have shifted their ranges over the last century. the recent change in the climate has been suggested to drive changes in both phenology  <cit>  and distribution  <cit>  of odonates.

ischnura elegans and i. graellsii are very similar ecologically and morphologically, but they can be unambiguously identified by the morphology of prothorax and anal appendages and by the comparatively small body and short wings of i. graellsii  <cit> . furthermore, genetic analyses have shown that i. elegans and i. graellsii are very similar both at allozymes  <cit> , and at the mitochondrial cytochrome b and coenzyme ii genes . previous work has documented that the two species hybridize in the laboratory  <cit> , and hybrids  have been detected in one sympatric locality in north-western spain  <cit> .

wirtz  <cit>  reviewed the factors promoting unidirectional or reciprocal hybridization and proposed a hypothesis based on sexual selection to explain unidirectional hybridization. he proposed that hybridization is more likely between the female of the rare species and the male of the common species. however, when the rare species is also the bigger species, hybridization can be impeded by mechanical incompatibility  <cit> , and the outcome degree and direction of hybridization is difficult to predict. previous findings from the field   <cit>  and laboratory  <cit>  indicate that i. graellsii  suffers a mating disadvantage in sympatry with i. elegans . in particular, males of i. elegans readily mate with females of i. graellsii in the laboratory but males of i. graellsii are mechanically incapable of mating with i. elegans females  <cit> . the resulting f1-hybrid males can only mate with i. graellsii females, whereas the f1-hybrid females are mechanically incapable of mating with males of i. graellsii but can instead mate with i. elegans males  <cit> . furthermore, f1-hybrids  show a similar degree of reduced viability and fertility . these conditions can be hypothesized to result in a directional bias in hybridization in favour of i. elegans that could explain the recently documented range expansion of i. elegans into areas that were previously only occupied by i. graellsii  <cit> . this agrees with the colonization pattern of i. elegans in the area. under the described scenario of introgressive hybridization, we hypothesize extensive introgression of i. graellsii genes into the spanish i. elegans populations. furthermore, introgression and interspecific competition are probably contributing to the fast range expansion of i. elegans and contraction of i. graellsii in iberia.

interestingly, several ischnura species, including i. elegans and i. graellsii, are characterized by a conspicuous colour polymorphism that is limited to females  <cit> . females exhibit three colour morphs; one androchrome 1] and two gynochromes colour morphs  or aurantiaca )  <cit> . the colour polymorphism is controlled by a simple genetic system consisting of one gene with three alleles that are in a dominance hierarchy  <cit> . how the colour polymorphism of ischnura damselflies is maintained in space and time has been a much discussed subject. indeed, hybridization was the first mechanism proposed for maintaining the colour polymorphism in this genus  <cit> . for example, hybridization was hypothesized to maintain contrasting androchrome frequencies in nearby populations of i. damula and i. demorsa, and i. elegans and i. graellsii, respectively  <cit> . under the aforementioned scenario of extensive introgressive hybridization of i. graellsii genes into the spanish i. elegans populations, and the hypothesised role of the hybridization for the temporal maintenance of contrasting androchrome frequencies; female morph frequencies of i. elegans in nearby populations to i. graellsii must be more similar to i. graellsii frequencies, due to the absorption of the typical morph frequencies, than in populations of i. elegans located far away of i. graellsii populations. in fact, gosden & svensson  <cit>  proposed that the contrasting androchrome frequencies observed in the spanish populations of i. elegans could be a by-product of the hybridization in combination with a founder effect.

the objectives of the present study were to examine the spatial distribution of i. graellsii and i. elegans in the iberian peninsula, evaluate the extent of introgression of i. graellsii genes into the recently established i. elegans populations in spain, and to understand the role of the hybridization on the temporal maintenance of female colour morph frequencies in both species. therefore, we conducted a detailed reconstruction of the distribution of the two species in spain to quantify the overlap in space between the species. furthermore, we examined the degree of introgression in nine i. elegans populations within the zone of overlap using both nuclear microsatellite markers  <cit>  and mitochondrial genes  <cit> . previous studies have shown that analyses based on differentiated markers between parental species can be used to efficiently and accurately describe admixture proportions, i.e. the degree of introgression, in f1-hybrids and backcrosses see  <cit> . furthermore, studies have also shown the usefulness of mitochondrial dna in the study of introgressive hybridization because of their maternal inheritance  <cit> . specifically, with this method f1- and f2-hybrids may be assigned to a particular maternal species based on the mtdna haplotype they carry. however, a prerequisite is that the species do not share haplotypes, which may happen because of hybridization and ancestral polymorphisms  <cit> . finally, in order to evaluate if the previously observed uncharacteristic morph frequencies of i. elegans populations in north-western spain, where frequencies are broadly different between populations  <cit> , extend into the sympatric area , we combined morph frequency data from previous studies  <cit>  with new data from this study, and discuss the proposed hypothesis about the role of hybridization in the temporal maintenance of the colour polymorphism.

RESULTS
spatial distribution of i. graellsii and i. elegans in the iberian peninsula
using the available distribution data of i. elegans and i. graellsii in spain, we constructed two geographic maps to show their overall distributional range . species overlap in north and central spain . in particular, i. graellsii is found all over the iberian peninsula, while i. elegans is very rare in southern spain .

introgressive hybridization
all population groups  exhibited a high degree of molecular diversity . estimates of observed and expected heterozygosity were similar and ranged from  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig> , respectively . in the spanish i. elegans populations, we detected a total of  <dig> alleles,  <dig> less than in the other european i. elegans populations. in contrast to i. elegans, we found somewhat fewer  alleles for i. graellsii, perhaps due to the fact that the microsatellites were specifically developed for i. elegans which could cause an ascertainment bias. estimates of allelic richness were comparable between the spanish and the other european i. elegans populations , and were considerably higher than in i. graellsii .

analyses of the overall genetic structure showed that i. elegans populations were significantly differentiated from one another in europe outside spain  as well as within spain . moreover, populations of i. graellsii were also significantly differentiated from one another .

four of  <dig> principal component axes accounted for a significant amount of genetic variation among samples, as indicated by a screen plot. the first axis contained 24% , the second axis 17% , the third axis 14%  and the fourth axis 11%  of the total variation . the first two principal components thus summarise almost half  of the total variation inherent in all i. elegans and i. graellsii populations. the scores for the first principal component axis revealed a clear separation of i. graellsii and i. elegans populations, suggesting that major population differences were predominantly caused by species rather than geographic areas per se. major population differences  were revealed by the second pca axis, where two of the spanish i. elegans populations  were situated in the same quadrant that was occupied by all i. graellsii populations .

analyses of the population structure in structure supported the molecular differentiation between the two ischnura species, although the Δk-method suggested three clusters as the most likely population structure . more specifically, the results showed that one of the genetic clusters highly corresponded to the i. graellsii group, while the other two genetic clusters were best represented by i. elegans genotypes , with the spanish populations showing an intermediate assignment to each of these three genetic clusters .

based on these results, we included all populations of i. graellsii and i. elegans in the structure runs  to analyse the individual admixture proportions of i. elegans individuals in spain . these results showed that one genetic cluster clearly corresponded to i. graellsii, while the other cluster corresponded to i. elegans . the majority of individuals of the european i. elegans outside spain  and i. graellsii  were assigned with a certainty of at least 90% to each of these clusters. however, only 27% of individuals of the spanish i. elegans were strongly assigned to i. elegans  and one individual  was assigned to i. graellsii . the rest of the spanish i. elegans individuals were intermediate between the two clusters , suggesting a significant degree of introgressed i. graellsii alleles .

the admixture proportions of the artificial hybrids and backcrosses ranged between 11-89% . the f <dig> and f <dig> showed admixture proportions to i. elegans between  <dig> and 21%; the  <dig> gb  between  <dig> and 11%; and the four i. elegans backcrosses  between  <dig> and 21% . based on these results, we defined three conservative assignment groups: backcrosses with i. elegans with admixture between 89-68%; backcrosses with i. graellsii ranging between 20-11%; and a mixed group of f <dig>  f <dig> and backcrosses ranging between 67-21%. when the spanish i. elegans individuals  were allocated by their admixture proportions in one of these three groups, a total of  <dig> individuals  were assigned to backcrosses with i. elegans , whereas not a single individual was assigned to the backcross with i. graellsii  . finally, the rest of the spanish i. elegans , excluding the single individual from alfaro that was assigned to i. graellsii, were assigned to the mixed-hybrid group, including f <dig>  f <dig> and backcrosses with the parental species .

the alignments for the cytochrome c oxidase i and ii , cytochrome b , 12s rrna  and nadh dehydrogenase  <dig>  fragments included  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp, respectively . all new sequences were deposited in genbank . coi fragment showed no polymorphic sites, revealing a unique haplotype  that was shared by the two species. coii showed one polymorphic site, revealing two haplotypes . haplotype h <dig>  the most abundant haplotype, was shared by the species in both allopatric and sympatric regions, while haplotype h <dig> appeared only in the three samples of i. graellsii from one allopatric region . cytb fragment showed two polymorphic sites revealing three haplotypes . each species showed one unique haplotype , in a single sample from one allopatric region , respectively, while the rest of the samples of both species shared a common haplotype . the 12s fragment showed three polymorphic sites revealing four haplotypes . ischnura elegans showed three unique haplotypes , each of which appeared in a unique sample , while the rest of the samples of both species shared the common haplotype h <dig>  the last fragment, nd <dig>  showed one polymorphic site, revealing two haplotypes . the most abundant haplotype  was shared by both species , while the second haplotype  appeared only in one sample of i. graellsii .

the genes are cytochrome c oxidase i and ii , cytochrome b , 12s rrna  and nadh dehydrogenase  <dig> . genbank accession numbers: hq834794-hq <dig> 

colour morph frequencies
all populations showed all three female morphs, with the exception of saïdia in northern africa  . in populations dominated by i. elegans from north-central, central and eastern spain, androchrome, infuscans and infuscans-obsoleta frequencies were highly variable between populations  which is consistent with what has previously been observed for the i. elegans populations from north-western spain  <cit> . in allopatric populations of i. graellsii, androchrome frequencies were always below 20% ; with the infuscans morph being the most abundant morph type . the sympatric populations, o vilar and xuño, which have previously shown very high frequencies of androchromes for both species  <cit> , also showed in our study high levels of androchrome frequencies . in addition, the sympatric populations las cañas and alfaro from central spain further showed high androchrome frequencies .

discussion
hybridization and genomic introgression are repeatedly suggested to be important elements in evolutionary processes such as maintenance of genetic variation, adaptation and speciation  <cit> . determining the degree of genetic exchange between recently diverged species may be of particular interest in this sense since they typically show incomplete reproductive barriers. moreover, the pattern and extent of hybridization and introgression can have important conservation implications because it may lead to the replacement of one of the hybridizing taxa  <cit> .

in the present study, we have revealed extensive hybridization and introgression in i. elegans populations in iberia where it co-occurs sympatrically with its closely related sister species i. graellsii. distribution maps for both species show an extended area of overlap in northern and central spain. ischnura graellsii is generally very abundant all along the iberian peninsula, while i. elegans has a patchy distribution. for example, i. elegans is very rare in southern spain. in the sympatric regions, i. elegans is also less abundant than i. graellsii  and is not present at all in some provinces . consequently, i. graellsii occurs allopatrically in southern iberia , whereas i. elegans is exclusively found in areas that are also occupied by i. graellsii. our admixture analyses in structure revealed clear evidence of past and present hybridization and introgression between i. elegans and i. graellsii over a large geographic area in northern spain. the degree of introgression in the populations is consistent with i. elegans backcrosses and occasional f1-hybrids. thus, hybridization between these two damselfly species is a relatively recent and widespread phenomenon. interestingly, the studied populations have been going through a recent species turn-over and are now dominated by i. elegans individuals that appear to carry introgressed i. graellsii genetic material. these kinds of dramatic demographic and genetic effects have not previously been documented in odonates, although it is known from other taxa. for instance, over the past century, the blue-winged  warbler has rapidly replaced the golden-winged warbler  over an extensive part of their hybrid zone in eastern north america. marker-based analyses show asymmetric and rapid introgression from blue-winged warbler into golden-winged warbler in some areas and bidirectional maternal gene flow in others  <cit> . rapid introgression has also been detected in other taxa, e.g. in pocket gophers   <cit> .

extent of hybridization and direction of introgression
in vertebrates, hybridization is particularly common in fish, where several hundred interspecific and intergeneric crosses have been reported, and in birds, with roughly 10% of all species known to have bred in nature with another species e.g.  <cit> . in comparison, detailed genetic studies of hybridization and introgression, and thus the knowledge about these phenomena, are lacking for most odonates  <cit> . as mentioned above, three previous genetic studies failed in detecting extensive hybridization between different pairs of odonate species  <cit> . our admixture analysis in structure showed that the i. elegans populations louro and laxe in north-western spain had the highest degree of introgression of i. graellsii alleles. this is not surprising, given that north-western spain is the region where hybridization between i. elegans and i. graellsii was most recently detected  <cit> . in  <dig>  i. elegans, i. graellsii and hybrids were found in foz , which is geographically close to louro and laxe. however, after only ten years, the population was dominated by individuals that were phenotypically classified as i. elegans, although morphological intermediate and i. graellsii males were occasionally detected  <cit> . the population laxe was visited for the first time in june  <dig>  and only i. elegans were detected, although at a low densities . at a visit in june  <dig>  i. elegans were found at a similar density . five years later , we revisited the population and the density had reached the highest value in the region. a total of seven visits were conducted in  <dig>  between june and august, and the density ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  males/minute; and neither i. graellsii nor putative hybrids were detected. nevertheless, the admixture analyses showed that none of the  <dig> examined individuals at laxe could be genetically assigned to pure i. elegans status. nine individuals were assigned to f <dig>  f <dig>  or backcrosses with i. elegans , and five individuals were assigned to backcrosses with i. elegans . in  <dig>  louro was visited for first time by ocharan  <cit>  and mainly i. graellsii individuals were observed. however, torralba and ocharan  <cit>  reviewed ocharan's samples from louro  and have now identified both species in the sample; nevertheless, i. graellsii species still remains the dominant species. however, on our first visit in  <dig> and on subsequent visits, i. elegans individuals completely dominated in numbers . only one out of the  <dig> louro individuals that were molecularly examined in the present study was assigned to be pure i. elegans. in addition, the vast majority of the individuals  showed an assignment proportion between 89-68%, suggesting that these individuals were backcrosses, and not f <dig> or f <dig> hybrids.

these results are corroborated by the pca-analysis. both laxe and louro were placed within the i. graellsii quadrant, indicating a significant degree of molecular similarity between these i. elegans populations and i. graellsii. analyses of the remaining spanish i. elegans populations showed that only 31% of the individuals were pure i. elegans, and that the remaining 69% showed admixture proportions expected for hybrids and backcrosses with i. elegans. in the alfaro population in the north-central spain where both species co-occur in equal numbers, one individual classified as i. elegans had a very high proportion of i. graellsii alleles. this either suggest that this individual was misclassified despite the fact that we only collected males to minimise misidentifications  <cit> , or that it is a backcross that has inherited a very high proportion of i. graellsii alleles at the few markers analysed.

our suggest that hybridization between i. elegans and i. graellsii is asymmetric and largely unidirectional. this corroborates previous findings in the field  <cit>  and laboratory  <cit>  showing that i. graellsii has a mating disadvantage in sympatry with i. elegans. heterospecific matings, and matings between the f1-hybrids and the parental species, rarely take place with i. elegans females, but occur more frequently among i. graellsii females, i. elegans males and hybrids . the reason for the almost complete lack of hybridization between i. graellsii males and i. elegans females is that males cannot grasp the female by their protothorax  <cit> , a mechanical handicap that appears to be a very efficient prezygotic isolation mechanism. previous work on plants  <cit>  and animals  <cit>  has suggested that unidirectional hybridization usually occurs between the females of the rare species and the males of a common species, but not vice versa. wirtz  <cit>  reviewed the factors promoting unidirectional or reciprocal hybridization and proposed a sexual selection hypothesis for unidirectional hybridization based on the fact that females normally invest more in offspring and, therefore, are more discriminating than males. when heterospecific males are less abundant than conspecific males, females rarely mate with heterospecific males. consequently, under such a condition, the rare species is usually the maternal parent of the hybrids. however, this is not the case in our study where the more abundant species is initially i. graellsii. ischnura elegans, on the other hand, appears to be the intruding species and is hence initially the rare species, which has been expanding its range in spain and is now displacing i. graellsii from some populations and regions. thus, the direction of hybridization between these two ischnura species is opposite that expected based on the rare female hybridization hypothesis just outlined e.g.  <cit> , but follows the prediction proposed by grant and grant  <cit> , namely that when the rare species is also the bigger species , hybridization can be impeded by mechanical incompatibility. laboratory tests have detected that i. elegans females and i. graellsii males are mechanically impaired to form a tandem, preventing over 93% of all matings, while only 13% of the matings between i. graellsii females and i. elegans males are mechanically prevented .

the role of hybridization in the maintenance of colour polymorphisms
johnson  <cit>  proposed that the colour polymorphisms in odonates could be maintained due to hybridization between closely related species and balanced by differential predation pressure. according to this hypothesis, androchrome females benefit from avoiding matings with heterospecific males, while gynochromes females are involved in heterospecific matings ; the relative fitness of the colour morphs is balanced by a higher probability of predation of the androchrome females. in a recent study on i. elegans and i. graellsii  <cit> , a role of hybridization for the temporal maintenance of contrasting androchrome frequencies in nearby populations in north-western spain was suggested. the relatively low androchrome frequencies in i. elegans populations located close to i. graellsii populations, and the relatively high androchrome frequencies in i. graellsii populations adjacent to i. elegans populations, were hypothesized to be caused by the absorption of the, in other circumstances, typical morph frequency  <cit> . ischnura elegans data from other sympatric regions in the iberian peninsula now shows that the substantial variation in female morph frequencies between different populations in north-western spain is not unique to this region; also in other parts of iberia morph frequencies are drastically variable between populations . furthermore, other recent studies have revealed that disparate morph frequencies are not restricted to iberian populations  <cit> , although androchrome frequencies are typically more abundant in northern latitudes and show less variation between populations than in iberia . in our study, the highest frequencies of androchromes were found in the four populations with both species present ; in i. graellsii androchrome frequencies ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> % and in i. elegans between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. nevertheless, the i. graellsii population ribeira de cobres had androchrome frequencies of  <dig> %, for this species an atypically high level. however, this comparatively high androchrome frequency cannot be explained by the influence of nearby i. elegans populations, because this population is located in the allopatric region . furthermore, in i. elegans the lowest androchrome frequencies were found in north-central spain  where the nearest i. graellsii population  had higher androchrome frequencies  than the i. elegans population , and in a coastal population near the mediterranean coast  , but here we lack data of i. graellsii morph frequencies in nearby populations.

in conclusion, hybridization is likely to have important implications for the maintenance of multiple female morphs, but only during the short period when two species with contrasting morph frequencies start to hybridize.

the evolution, maintenance and adaptive function of genetic colour polymorphism have received very much attention in a broad range of organisms, e.g. in birds  <cit> , reptiles  <cit>  and insects  <cit> . however, the role of hybridization in this context has received little attention, which may simply reflect the fact that only a few suitable study systems are available to study; one being the presently described ischnura damselfly complex in spain. another case is the hybrid zone of the land snails mandarina mandarina and m. chichijimana in the oceanic bonin islands  <cit> . in that system, the variability of the colour polymorphism in the hybrid population was substantially higher than that in the pure populations, suggesting that morphological variation was maintained by hybridization  <cit> . these results highlight the importance of hybridization as a source of morphological variation, diversity and evolutionary novelty.

CONCLUSIONS
when hybrids are fertile and backcross with one of the parental species, hybridization will inevitably result in introgression, thereby increasing the genetic variability of the introgressed species  <cit> . even at low levels, introgression of novel genetic material could be an important factor as a source of new genetic and phenotypic variability, and subsequent evolution. thus a certain degree of hybridization could create favourable conditions for new adaptations  <cit> . in contrast, extensive hybridization and introgression can, as mentioned above, sometimes have important conservation implications when leading to the replacement of one of the hybridizing taxa  <cit> . we have documented a unique case of hybridization and unidirectional introgression in polymorphic ischnura damselflies, where hybridization is likely to having important implications on the temporal maintenance of multiple female morphs. the potential adaptive significance of introgression in the system, and whether this per se has contributed to the rapid species turn-over in sympatric populations in the region, remains to be evaluated.
