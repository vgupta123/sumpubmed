BACKGROUND
streptomyces are gram-positive eubacteria that are the major natural source of antibiotics, producing about half of all known microbial antibiotics  <cit> . this genus also has a complex life cycle, in which spores germinate to form a substrate mycelium of branching hyphae on solid medium, from which branches grow into the air, such multi-nucleoid aerial hyphae ultimately becoming septated to form chains of unigenomic spores  <cit> .

streptomyces coelicolor is the most studied streptomyces species and an excellent model for studying antibiotic production and differentiation  <cit> . it produces several chemically different antibiotics, including the blue-pigmented actinorhodin , red-pigmented undecylprodigiosin , calcium-dependent antibiotic  and plasmid scp1-encoded methylenomycin . pathway-specific regulatory genes, e.g. actii-orf <dig>  redd, cdar and mmyb, are required for initiating transcription of the corresponding antibiotics biosynthetic gene clusters; while pleiotropic regulators, e.g. afsr, often affect multiple secondary metabolism  <cit> . by using s. coelicolor as a model system, two dozen genes , most of them encoding regulatory proteins, important for initiation of aerial mycelium formation and sporulation have been identified  <cit> . more than  <dig> other genes from primary metabolism  and stress-response  etc also affect streptomyces differentiation, indicating that the regulatory signaling cascades for aerial growth and sporulation extensively interact with metabolic, morphological, homeostatic and stress-related checkpoints  <cit> . recently, several key genes affecting apical growth, chromosome segregation and cell division  have been identified.

here we describe identification of a cluster of six co-transcribed genes cmdabcdef  in s. coelicolor that affect sporulation and antibiotic production.

RESULTS
co-transcription of six genes sco4126- <dig> of s. coelicolor
earlier work indicated that the six co-transcribed genes  of streptomyces linear plasmid slp <dig> are required for plasmid conjugal transfer  <cit> . interestingly, three genes slp <dig> - <dig> resembled sco4127- <dig> of s. coelicolor chromosome , which were also located in a cluster of six genes sco4126- <dig> . the transcription directions of sco4126- <dig> were same. to see if they were co-transcribed, reverse transcription-pcr  was employed. as shown in figure 1b, compared with the positive  and negative controls , the expected sizes of pcr products were detected on agarose gel from the cdna, reversely transcribed from the total rna, by using primers from the neighboring genes of sco4126- <dig>  while this analysis does indicate a transcript exists that covers the entire length of the cluster, it is possible that other transcripts exist from other promoters within the cluster that do not span all  <dig> genes.

to investigate if sco4126- <dig> were involved in plasmid transfer, null mutants of the whole gene cluster were constructed by pcr-targeted mutagenesis  <cit> . however, no significant difference in transfer frequencies of the slp2-derived linear plasmid pqc <dig> which contained genes for dna replication in linear mode and plasmid conjugal transfer  <cit>  between the mutant and the wild-type was found , suggesting that these chromosomal genes could not substitute for the slp <dig> genes for plasmid transfer.

null mutants of sco4126- <dig> display defective sporulation
to study the functions of sco4126- <dig>  null mutants of the individual genes or complete gene cluster were constructed by in-frame replacement via pcr-targeting with an apramycin resistance gene and then removing the marker, excluding potential polar effects on expression of the gene cluster. after culturing the mutants on ms medium for  <dig> days, as seen in figure 2a, the Δsco <dig> strain, as well as wild-type strain m <dig>  produced dark grey colonies on agar plate, whereas colonies of all the other null mutants, including a Δsco4126- <dig> mutant, were light grey, and seemed to produce fewer spores. in time courses of m <dig> and null mutants of sco <dig>  sco <dig> and sco4126- <dig> on ms agar , the Δsco <dig> or Δsco4126- <dig> strains had a significant delay in aerial mycelium formation, and sporulated  <dig> or  <dig> days later than the wild-type strain, while there was no apparent difference in sporulation between m <dig> and the Δsco <dig> strain. introduction into the mutants of the corresponding genes or the whole gene cluster by derivatives of the chromosomally integrating plasmid pset <dig> or pfx <dig> could restore the timing of forming aerial mycelium and sporulations to the wild-type level, but introduction of the sco <dig> alone could not complement the defects in sporulation in the sco4126- <dig> mutant , confirming that the observed defective sporulation was caused by deletions of the genes. five of the sco4126- <dig> genes encoded membrane proteins, while sco <dig> encoded an atp/gtp-binding protein. thus, the sco4126- <dig> gene cluster was designated cmda-f .

aberrant branches, defective spore septation and abnormal chromosome segregation in null mutants
after harvesting, diluting and plating out spores on medium, the numbers of spores  obtained from the Δcmdb and especially Δcmda-f strains were obviously less than that of wide type m <dig> . to characterise these aerial hyphae and spores, we employed phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy. under phase-contrast microscopy, normally long unbranched aerial hyphae were seen in m <dig>  whereas multiple branching from both aerial and apical hyphae, giving rise to unusually short spore chains, was observed in the Δcmdb and Δcmda-f strains . scanning electron microscopy revealed, in contrast to nearly complete septation of aerial hyphae and formation of abundant long spore chains in m <dig>  most aerial hyphae in null mutants of cmdb and cmda-f were collapsed and unable to septate to become spores, while some of hyphae could eventually develop into short spore chains . to further dissect these sporulating aerial hyphae, we employed fluorescence microscopy. sporulating hyphae were fixed and then their chromosomes were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole . fluorescence microscopy revealed that chromosomes in wide-type m <dig> were distributed at regularly spaced intervals along spore chains , and anucleate spores were observed at a low frequency . however, incomplete separation of chromosomes was readily seen in the mutants, shown as unevenly stained chromosomes along spore chains ; and anucleate spores appeared at a frequency of 8% and 6% along spore chains for the Δcmdb and Δcmda-f strains , respectively. taken together, the Δcmdb or Δcmda-f strains showed aberrant branches, defective chromosome segregation and abnormally spaced spore septation.

cmdb, an atp/gtp-binding protein with an abc-transporter atpase domain, is located on the cell membrane
cmdb encoded an atp/gtp-binding protein and cmda, c, d, e and f encoded membrane proteins. to see if cmdb protein was also located on the cell membrane, both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared from cell extracts, electrophoresed on a denatured polyacrymide gel and probed by western-blotting with anti-cmdb antibody. as seen in figure 4a, cmdb protein was only detected in membrane  but not in cytosolic  fractions.

cmdb contained an abc-transporter-atpase domain  according to superfamily  <dig>  analysis http://supfam.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/superfamily/hmm.html. this superfamily includes several families of characterized or predicted atpases which are predominantly involved in extrusion of dna and peptides through membrane pores  <cit> . to investigate whether this domain was required for the function of cmdb, lysines at conserved positions  <dig> or  <dig> were mutated to arginines by site-directed mutagenesis . the mutated cmdb genes were cloned into pfx <dig>  and then introduced by conjugation into the cmdb null mutant. in contrast to the functional cmdb gene, the site-mutated cmdb genes could not complement the cmdb null mutant to reverse its phenotype of over-production of blue pigment  and also to produce dark grey colony to the wild type level . these results indicated that the mutated residues were essential for function. it was however also possible that the mutations had destabilised the protein, causing it to degrade much more rapidly than the wild-type form.

transcription of cmdb during differentiation
to see if transcription of cmdb was regulated during differentiation, strain m <dig> grown on ms medium was harvested at different times for rt-pcr and analysed using primers specific for cmdb. as seen in figure 4c, a small amount of cmdb transcript could be detected from mainly vegetative mycelium , and a larger amount  was produced at the stage of aerial mycelium formation  and continued to increase during sporulation . these results suggested that transcription of cmdb was regulated temporally, possibly developmentally.

the cmda-f orthologues in s. lividans and s. avermilitis also affect differentiation
by using primers from cmda-f of s. coelicolor m <dig> and template dna from s. lividans zx <dig>  the same sizes of pcr bands as m <dig> were detected , suggesting that the s. lividans genome contained similar genes. the cosmid used in constructing the cmda-f null mutant of m <dig> was introduced by conjugation into zx <dig>  and the resulting strain displayed a phenotype of very poor sporulation but no visible blue pigment on ms agar plate after culturing for  <dig> days. a serious block of formation of aerial hyphae in the null mutant was observed under scanning electron microscopy .

the complete nucleotide sequence of s. avermitilis genome reveals a highly homologous gene cluster  to cmda-f  <cit> . a null mutant of sav4098- <dig> was constructed in s. avermilitis nrrl <dig>  its defective sporulation was displayed on ms medium, and blocking in development of coiled aerial hyphae was observed under microscopy compared with that of the wild type . no over-production of antibiotic avermectin was detected in the null mutant .

several null mutants of cmdabcdef reveal over-production of blue pigment
as seen in figure 2a, null mutants of cmdb, d, e or cmda-f also produced a large amount of blue pigment on ms medium, while little or no blue pigment was produced for other null mutants  and wild type m <dig>  introduction of additional copies of the functional cmdb or cmda-f into the mutants could reduce the production of blue pigment to the wild-type level , confirming that blue pigment over-production was caused by mutation of the genes, and also suggesting that these genes are involved in repression of blue pigment production in m <dig> 

initiating transcription of the pathway-specific regulatory gene actii-orf <dig> of actinorhodin biosynthesis at an earlier growth stage in the cmda-f null mutant
in s. coelicolor, pathway-specific regulatory gene actii-orf <dig> is essential for initiating transcription of the whole biosynthetic gene cluster of blue-pigment actinorhodin  <cit> . to study transcription of actii-orf <dig> in the cmda-f null mutant, we harvested spores/mycelium from ms plates after different growth periods and isolated rna for rt-pcr. as seen in figure 6b, transcription of actii-orf <dig> in the null mutant started as early as  <dig> h and then reached a maximum at  <dig> h, ~ <dig> and  <dig> h earlier than was observed in m <dig> 

discussion
here, we report that an operon of six genes cmdabcdef  of s. coelicolor, encoding five membrane proteins and one membrane-located atp/gtp-binding protein, affects differentiation and causes increased production of an antibiotic, actinorhodin. the Δcmdabcdef strains reveal aberrant branches and short aerial hyphae. expression of cmdb, and therefore presumably of the whole operon, was detectable during vegetative growth, but increased substantially as soon as aerial growth was detectable. similar conserved gene clusters are also found in other streptomyces species, e.g. s. avermitilis , s. griseus  and s. lividans . serious block in forming aerial hyphae in s. lividans and in the development of coiled aerial hyphae in s. avermitilis were observed when their cmd operons were disrupted. together, these results indicate that cmdabcdef proteins mainly affect streptomyces differentiation early in aerial hyphae formation.

the Δcmdabcdef strains of s. coelicolor also showed defective chromosome segregation during sporulation. in prokaryotes, motor proteins such as ftsk and spoiiie containing a conserved reca domain are often associated with dna translocation during processes of cell division, conjugation and sporulation  <cit> . in s. coelicolor, ftsk and para/parb are required for proper chromosome segregation during sporulation  <cit> . however, despite detectable levels of errors in chromosome segregation in ftsk or parab mutants, the majority of chromosomes still appear to segregate properly, suggesting that other proteins are also involved in chromosome partition or segregation. according to analysis using the protein homology/analogy recognition engine phyre http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre/html/index.html, cmdb protein was predicted containing a reca domain  or e. coli-ftsk motor domain , suggesting that it might be an atp/gtp-dependent motor protein. cmdb displays homology with virb4-like proteins from frankia, brevibacterium, geobacillus and thermoanaerobacter  etc. the virb <dig>  an essential component of the bacterial type iv system, interacts with other membrane proteins in the vir operon to assemble a pore for transfer of a dna-protein complex  <cit> . since cmdb is also located on the cell membrane, it is likely that cmdb along with other five membrane proteins from the same gene cluster might form a complex on the cell membrane. further study will be needed to explore the existence of such a complex and to investigate whether it could form a type iv-like channel on cell membrane for chromosome and/or plasmid translocation in streptomyces.

about  <dig> and  <dig> genes of s. coelicolor genome are predicted to encode membrane and atp/gtp-binding proteins, respectively . among these, sco <dig>  sco <dig> and sco <dig>  located in a cluster of  <dig> probably co-transcribed genes sco6871- <dig>  highly resemble cmdb, cmdc and cmdd, respectively. however, null mutants of sco <dig> or sco <dig> did not display defective sporulation or over-production of blue pigment on ms medium . thus, either these genes are not involved in sporulation and antibiotic production, or their role may be masked by functional overlap with other genes, or the phenotype might be manifested only under particular conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes the identification of six co-transcribed genes cmdabcdef, deletions of which displayed over-expression of blue-pigmented act, defective sporulation and especially abnormalities in chromosome segregation, indicating that cmdabcdef are new genes involved in antibiotic production and differentiation of s. coelicolor.
