BACKGROUND
arachidonic acid , an ω- <dig> long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid , is one of the major components of mammalian brain membrane phospholipids. it makes up approximately 20% of the total fatty acids along with docosahexaenoic acid  in the brain  <cit> . in addition, ara is an important precursor for the biosynthesis of diverse eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes, which play important roles in smooth muscle stimulation, platelet aggregation control and the release of histamine during anaphylactic shock and other allergic reactions  <cit> . ara deficiencies have been associated with neuro-visual development disorders and other premature birth complications  <cit> . ara is therefore considered an essential nutrient in addition to dha during early infant development and is suggested to be added into baby formula by the food and agriculture organization . besides, carotenoids are essential nutrients and important health beneficial compounds with respect to their antioxidant properties and ability to alleviate chronic diseases  <cit> . human beings are mostly incapable to synthesize carotenoids de novo, therefore, they rely upon diet to obtain these compounds.

ara can be commercially obtained from marine fish oil, animal tissues and fungi  <cit> . interest in ara and other long-chain pufas inspired the search for new pufa sources. myrmecia incisa reisigl h <dig>  a coccoid green microalga species of trebouxiophyceae  <cit> , has recently been reported to accumulate an unprecedentedly high amount of ara-rich triacylglycerols  in cytoplasmic lipid bodies  <cit> . when m. incisa was cultured under nitrogen starvation for  <dig> d, its ara content increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of dry weight  biomass and 76% of the intracellular ara accumulated in the form of neutral lipids  <cit> . in addition, carotenoids content increased as well under nitrogen starvation in parietochloris incisa   <cit> . thus, m. incisa may be a potential resource for both ara and carotenoids exploitation.

there are two pathways proposed in microalgae for ara biosynthesis  <cit> . the understanding of ara biosynthesis pathway in m. incisa, thus, is first of all for the improvement of ara level. therefore, genes encoding fatty acid desaturases and elongase of this microalga have been characterized, and some routes were determined by heterologous expression of these genes in model organisms  <cit> . carotenogenesis pathways in microalgae are similar to those in higher plants on one hand, and possess microalgae-specific features on the other hand  <cit> . some common carotenogenesis genes have been identified in microalgae  <cit> , whereas the molecular information for carotenoids biosynthesis in m. incisa is rather limited  <cit> .

expressed sequence tag  analysis is the primary tool for novel gene discovery, particularly in non-model organisms for which full genome sequencing is not economically feasible. by using sanger sequencing, a cdna library from m. incisa generated only  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig>  readable ests with little information of interest  <cit> . in contrast to this sequencing method, next-generation sequencing  technologies have led to a revolution in genomics and genetics and provided cheaper and faster delivery of sequencing information  <cit> . currently, the newest  <dig> pyrosequencing platform, gs flx titanium, is one of the most widely used ngs technologies for the de novo sequencing and analysis of transcriptome in both the model organism of microalga, chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit>  and non-model ones including alexandrium tamarense ccmp <dig>  <cit> , botryococcus braunii bot-88- <dig>  <cit> , botryococcus braunii bot- <dig>  <cit> , dunaliella tertiolecta utex lb  <dig>  <cit>  and oxyrrhis marina <cit> .

in this paper, the  <dig> pyrosequencing method was used to gain more insight into the m. incisa metabolism pathways. global transcriptome analysis revealed a c4-like photosynthesis pathway and a detailed lipid metabolism pathway. furthermore, the identification of sequences coding for caleosin and oil globule-associated protein in the transcriptome of m. incisa provided evidence for accumulation of tag in the form of oil body. finally, the disclosure of the genes involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids in m. incisa may favor the commercial exploitation of this algal resource in addition to ara production.

RESULTS
 <dig> pyrosequencing and de novo assembly
in total,  <dig>  reads  with an average length of 332 bp were generated from one pyrosequencing run. filtering  of the raw sequences resulted in  <dig>  high-quality  reads with an average length of  <dig> nucleotides, generating 119 mb corresponding to  <dig> % of the raw sequences . after clustering and assembling using cap <dig> clustering tools  <cit> , these reads were assembled into  <dig>  unique sequences consisting of  <dig>  contiguous sequences  and  <dig>  singletons  . approximately 77% of the total contigs comprised  <dig> to  <dig> reads . the average length of the total contigs, including  <dig> % that ranged from  <dig> to 599 bp, was 642 ± 438 bp, while the average length of singletons, including  <dig> % that ranged from  <dig> to 499 bp, was 299 ± 98 bp . in comparison with transcriptomes sequenced by  <dig> pyrosequencing from other microalgae, the hq percentage of the m. incisa reads was nearly the same as that for d. tertiolecta but higher than that for oxyrrhis marina . in addition, the average length of the m. incisa reads was shorter than that of d. tertiolecta but longer than that of b. braunii bot-88- <dig>  b. braunii bot- <dig> and oxyrrhis marina . this finding indicates that the sequencing data are creditable for further analysis. all of the hq reads are available in the sequence read archive  under the accession number sra <dig> 

a not available.

functional annotation
a total of  <dig>  contigs  and  <dig>  singletons  had significant blast matches from selection of the best hits against swiss-prot, genbank database and jgi genome portal at an e-value ≤ 10- <dig> . the percent of annotated contigs was consistent with the 20% to 40% of the values previously reported for de novo eukaryotic transcriptome assemblies  <cit> .

analysis of the  <dig>  blast-matched unique sequences suggested that there is less molecular information available for microalgae in comparison with other organisms in public databases as only approximately 42% of the blast-matched unique sequences were homologous to microalgae. however, unique sequences matched to genes from green microalgae accounted for 92% approximately, demonstrating a distinct microalgae character for the transcriptome of m. incisa . the matched green microalgal species were mainly chlamydomonas reinhardtii , volvox carteri , ostreococcus spp.  and micromonas spp.  , of which chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a model organism with a sequenced genome that has been the focus of most physiological, molecular and genetic studies  <cit> . the sequenced genomes of ostreococcus tauri, micromonas sp. rcc <dig> and micromonas sp. ccmp <dig> have offered valuable information for eukaryotic genome evolution and unusual photosynthesis apparatuses such as c4-like photosynthesis  <cit> .

of the  <dig>  unique sequences with blast matches,  <dig> %  were annotated with go terms, and  <dig> % of the go annotated unique sequences  were assigned ec numbers . one unique sequence may be assigned to several go categories, and the distribution of the most abundant go terms for molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components is presented in figure  <dig>  go annotation for cellular component and biological process categories highlighted the dominance of unique sequences associated with metabolic processes in cell, especially in cytoplasm, with fewer unique sequences involved with cell differentiation , communication  and cellular component movement . the latter is consistent with the unicellular morphology without any flagella during the vegetative growth of m. incisa <cit> . the molecular functional distribution indicated the top two assigned categories are binding processes  and catalytic activity . besides, no pathogenesis process occurred in this microalga reflecting to some extent the axenic culture of m. incisa in this study.

however, this analysis only provided a general concept for the function of these unique sequences but no assignment for the metabolic pathways that they are involved in. for further detailed understanding, unique sequences were then analyzed for ko identifiers using the kegg database.

pathway assignment by kegg
functional classification and pathway assignment was performed using kegg with the annotated unique sequences. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the relatively complete pathways that the unique sequences were assigned to were related to translation, replication and repair, amino acid metabolism and energy and substance metabolism including glycolysis, the tca cycle, pyruvate metabolism, photosynthesis, carbon fixation, starch and sucrose metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism and carotenoid biosynthesis. particular attention focused on the biosynthesis pathways of ara-rich tag and carotenoids because m. incisa had the potential to accumulate these compounds, particularly under nitrogen starvation  <cit> . interestingly, the assigned photosynthesis pathway suggested that m. incisa possessed some unique features for the carbon concentrating mechanism  as described below.

the c4-like photosynthesis pathway in m. incisa
the central carboxylation enzyme for co <dig> fixation during photosynthesis is named ribulose- <dig>  5- bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase , but its affinity to co <dig> is low  <cit> . to solve this problem, some plants, including several microalgae, such as phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> , thalassiosira pseudonana <cit> , ostreococcus tauri <cit>  and micromonas sp.  <cit> , have developed a c4-like photosynthesis pathway in addition to the biophysical ccm .

based on the transcriptome analysis, it is interesting to find that m. incisa possibly possesses a c4-like photosynthesis pathway during the ccm. several unique sequences encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase  were identified . each of these enzymes is necessary for c4-metabolism. three unique sequences encoding pepc have been identified, including one that is  <dig>  bp long with 71% amino acid identity with coccomyxa subellipsoidea c- <dig> . in addition, the putative protein sequence of this identified unique sequence revealed a pep binding site, an hco3- trapping site and a c-terminal tetrapeptide qntg  <cit> . subcellular localization analysis predicted that this pepc possesses neither a signal nor transit peptide , suggesting that it may function within the cytosol to produce oxaloacetic acid .

on the one hand, oaa is assumed to be transaminated to aspartate  by asp aminotransferase   <cit> . in fact, aat can catalyze the reversible transfer of oaa and glutamate to asp and α-ketoglutarate. eight unique sequences were identified to encode aat, and one was cytoplasmic and another was mitochondrial . the transaminated product in the cytosol, asp, is subsequently imported into mitochondria via an asp-glutamate carrier, which is important in malate/asp cycle  <cit> . one unique sequence in this transcriptome has been identified to have 53% identity with a mitochondrial isoform  from oryza sativa. once asp is transported into mitochondria, the mitochondrial aat functions to regenerate oaa, which is then decarboxylated to pep by a mitochondria-localized ppck. afterwards, the pep may be converted to pyruvate with the concomitant phosphorylation of adp to atp by pyruvate kinase  catalysis. a nad-dependent malate dehydrogenase  with a predicted mitochondrial transit peptide and its downstream enzyme nad-dependent malic enzyme , which has 46% identity with the mitochondrial me-nad+  from vitis vinifera, were identified . the resulting pyruvate from these two oaa decarboxylation pathways could participate in the tca cycle.

on the other hand, oaa is assumed to be reduced to malate by napd-dependent mdh , which targets chloroplasts  <cit> . although the mechanism of the oaa shuttle from the cytosol to chloroplast is unknown  <cit> , a unique sequence encoding chloroplast-localized mdh-nadp+ was identified in m. incisa. in addition, a putative nadp-dependent me-coding unique sequence  with 52% identity with a chloroplastic isoform  from glycine max was annotated . dehydrogenated malate from oaa is decarboxylated by me-nadp+ to generate two different products co <dig> and pyruvate. the former product is fixed by rubisco along with the calvin cycle, and the latter is converted by ppdk to pep, which is then transported to the cytosol as the substrate of pepc by pep/pi translocators. there are two putative chloroplast-localized pep/pi translocators, and they have  <dig> and 52% identity with the chloroplastic isoforms from brachypodium distachyon  and coccomyxa subellipsoidea c- <dig>  , respectively. in addition, a unique sequence encoding a pep/pi antiporter was identified, demonstrating that there must be a pep and pi exchange between chloroplast and the cytosol in m. incisa . the predicted subcellular localization of ppdk, which had 96% homology with that from methylobacterium radiotolerans jcm  <dig> , is unknown due to an incomplete sequence. however, the identified pep/pi translocator  implied that there should be one chloroplastic ppdk in m. incisa.

in summary, the identification of the crucial enzymes of c4-like photosynthesis, such as pepc, ppck and ppdk, and the transporters highlighted the ccm in m. incisa. it possesses both ca  and a c4-like photosynthesis pathway, thus enabling it to adapt to a low co <dig> level habitat. it is another microalga in chlorophyta with a c4-like ccm besides ostreococcus tauri <cit>  and micromonas sp.  <cit> .

de novo synthesis of fatty acids
global lipid biosynthesis pathways have been well known in many higher plants  <cit> , whereas fatty acid biosynthesis and accumulation in microalgae have not been well studied because the genetic background of microalgae is limited. high-throughput sequencing, however, enabled us to understand lipid metabolism in b. braunii <cit> , d. tertiolecta <cit>  and m. incisa .

in all plants, palmitic  and oleic acid  are almost exclusively de novo synthesized in chloroplasts via the key precursor acetyl-coenzyme a   <cit> . there are two possible processes for supplying acetyl-coa: one is directly from plastid pyruvate through the catalysis of pyruvate dehydrogenase/decarboxylase , and the other is an indirect regeneration from the imported mitochondrial acetate through the catalysis of acetyl-coa synthetase  in plastid. the generation of acetate in mitochondria begins as pyruvate with acetyl-coa as an intermediate and is sequentially catalyzed by mitochondrial pdh and acetyl-coa hydrolase   <cit> . based on transcriptome analysis, unique sequences encoding chloroplastic and mitochondrial pdh have been successfully identified . in addition, the putative mitochondrial ach and chloroplastic acs were identified , demonstrating consistency with the description by harwood  <cit> .

the carbon chain condensation reaction begins with acetyl-coa via the initial catalysis by acetyl-coa carboxylase . the generated malonyl-coa is subsequently converted into malonyl-acyl carrier protein  by malonyl-coa:acp transacylase , and the product, malonyl-acp, participates in whole fatty acid synthesis as an all-important source of 2c units. to complete the following series of condensation reactions, 3-ketoacyl-acp synthase , 3-oxoacyl acp reductase , 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-acp dehydratase  and enoyl-acp reductase  are involved. during this course, three condensing enzymes, kasi, kasii and kasiii, play different roles  <cit> . it has been reported that the subunits of kasi and kasii dimers are encoded by two closely related plastid genes  <cit> . however, kasi extends the carbon chain length from 4c to 16c during six rounds of 2c elongation, whereas kasii elongates palmitate  to stearate . kasiii, which is distinct from kasi and kasii and is found in all plants  <cit> , catalyzes the initial condensation reaction using acetyl-coa rather than acetyl-acp as a substrate for plant fatty acid synthesis . in m. incisa, at least one putative unique sequence of each type of kas was identified, suggesting that carbon chain condensation reactions in this alga are the same as that in most plants.

after the formation of acp-bound 18: <dig>  the first double bond is introduced via the catalysis of stearoyl-acp desaturase . this enzyme, which is present in the plastids of higher plants and algae, is the only soluble Δ <dig> desaturase  <cit> . in this transcriptome, one sad-coding unique sequence with 65% homology with plastid acyl-acp desaturase from coccomyxa subellipsoidea c- <dig>  was identified. products of fatty acid de novo biosynthesis, acp-bound 16: <dig> and 18:1Δ <dig> may subsequently constitute the biomembrane as a structural component or be exported into endoplasmic reticulum  for the biosynthesis of ara as a storage lipid .

biosynthesis of ara and tag
in eukaryotic algae, most of the desaturation of fatty acids is catalyzed by acyl-lipid desaturases rather than by acyl-acp desaturase. in chloroplasts, glycolipids, which mostly include monogalactosyldiacylglycerol , serve as substrates for chloroplastic Δ <dig>  and ω <dig> desaturases. in this study, several unique sequences encoding putative chloroplastic Δ12d and ω <dig> desaturases, which the latter has been confirmed to be Δ <dig> desaturase   <cit> , were identified. in addition, a full-length cdna sequence of mgdg-specific palmitate Δ <dig> desaturase , which is involved in desaturation leading to the formation of 16:1Δ <dig>  was also identified in this transcriptome. the biosynthesis of pufas taking place in the er is similar to that in chloroplasts with the exception of those utilizing phospholipids, i.e., phosphatidylcholine , as substrates . during the culture of m. incisa, a comparison of fatty acid content between complete and nitrogen-deficient medium suggested a possible biosynthesis pathway for ara, which begins with 18:1Δ <dig> with 18:2Δ <dig>   <dig>  18:3Δ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20:3Δ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> as successive intermediates. in this process, the er-harbored Δ12d, Δ <dig> desaturase , Δ <dig> elongase  and Δ <dig> desaturase  were involved; the genes encoding these enzymes have been cloned as well  <cit> . the result of this study and the cloned genes again confirmed the presence of an ara biosynthesis pathway in this microalga. moreover, three other Δ5d-coding unique sequences were identified in this transcriptome . although the subcellular localization of the other Δ5d was unpredictable due to incomplete sequences, these sequences provided further information for the investigation of ara and other pufa biosynthesis. the capacity of pufas may enhance the fluidity of the phospholipid membrane, which makes it possible for m. incisa to withstand chilling or cold stress  <cit> .

a previous study has reported that most of the intracellular ara was accumulated in the form of tag in m. incisa, particularly during nitrogen starvation  <cit> . during the accumulation process, glycerol-3-phosphate  and acyl-coa serve as primary substrates in the kennedy pathway . one of the substrates, g-3-p, is generated by glycolysis or the catalysis of free glycerol by glycerol kinase . however, sequence coding for glk was not identified in this study. the other substrate, acyl-coa, is generated via the esterification of free fatty acids exported from chloroplasts with coa. these two substances are acylated by a series of acyltransferases including the initial glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase . this enzyme catalyzes the acylation of the sn- <dig> position of g-3-p to produce 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate   <cit> . the sn- <dig> position of lpa is acylated by 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase  to generate phosphatidic acid . unique gpat- and lpaat-coding sequences were identified in the m. incisa transcriptome. subcellular localization prediction analysis demonstrated that gpat might target chloroplasts, whereas the localization of lpaat was unknown due to the lack of a complete sequence . pa is subsequently converted into either diacylglycerol  by phosphatidic acid phosphatase  or cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol  by phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase , and these two types of lipids alternately generate various phospholipids. the storage lipid, tag, is either formed via an acyl-coa-dependent reaction or an acyl-coa-independent reaction, and both of them use dag as an acyl-acceptor. the acyl-coa-dependent reaction, which is catalyzed by diacylglycerol acyltransferase , uses fatty acid acyl-coas as acyl donors, whereas the acyl-coa-independent reaction is mainly catalyzed by a phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  uses pc as acyl donors instead. dgat has two homologs, dgat <dig> and dgat <dig>  and their coding genes belong to the cholesterol acyltransferase gene family and the monoacylglycerol acyltransferase gene family, respectively. in m. incisa, there are five unique sequences encoding dgat, three were identified as dgat <dig>  and the rest were identified as dgat <dig> . in algae, membrane lipids, including photosynthetic ones, rapidly degrade with the accumulation of cytosolic tag-enriched lipid bodies when cells encounter stress  <cit> . if a pdat orthologue was identified, particularly in chloroplasts, then it is conceivable that pc or even galactolipids may be utilized as acyl donors in tag synthesis  <cit> . three unique sequences coding for pdat in this transcriptome were all partial sequences; thus, subcellular localization could not be predicted. however, this finding has already demonstrated that m. incisa is able to convert these membrane lipids into storage tag.

m. incisa has been reported to be able to accumulate tag in densely packed oil bodies  <cit> . oil bodies in higher plant seeds are the most prominent and well studied  <cit> . they are spherical organelles consisting of neutral lipids enclosed by a semi-layer membrane of phospholipids coated with proteins . thus far, only two proteins associated with oil bodies have been well described: oleosin and caleosin. oleosins are mostly found in higher plants and are thought to be important for oil body stabilization in the cytosol, while caleosins are thought to be ubiquitous in higher plants and algae and play an important role particularly in oil body degradation during seed germination  <cit> . in chlamydomonas reinhardtii, oleosin-like and caleosin-like genes were identified in the genome, whereas the relevant proteins were not identified by proteomic analysis  <cit> . two unique sequences encoding caleosin with an ef-hand domain were identified, whereas none of the oleosin coding unique sequences were identified in this ara-rich microalga , thus implying this caleosin may play an important role in oil body formation. in addition, two unique sequences encoding oil globule-associated proteins were identified , which may also be related to oil body formation. however, the functional characteristics of these two genes coding for caleosin and oil globule-associated protein need further studies.

tag degradation
degradation of the storage lipid tag plays an important role in the reconstruction of the cytoplasmic membranes of organisms grown under favorable conditions. the complete tag degradation process includes a series of hydrolysis reactions via lipase  <cit> . this reaction begins with the release of fatty acids from the sn- <dig> or sn- <dig> positions of tag to form dag by triacylglycerol lipase . dag is subsequently hydrolyzed into a fatty acid and 2-monoacylglycerol  via the catalysis of diacylglycerol lipase . isomerization of the latter product to 1-monoacyl-sn-glycerols occurs to some extent, and these may be completely degraded to glycerol and free fatty acids by monoacylglycerol lipase  . the α- and β-type dagl and tagl-coding unique sequences were identified in this transcriptome . it is worth mentioning that caleosin, as indicated above, may also play a role in tag degradation in m. incisa according to previous reports about seed development  <cit> .

in summary, all of the identified enzymes described above provide evidence for a better global understanding of the lipid metabolism process in m. incisa , though further study is needed to confirm their functional characteristics.

biosynthesis of carotenoids
in the past two decades, great advancements have been made in studies of carotenoid metabolism in higher plants and algae  <cit> . the entire biosynthesis process can be divided into the following major steps:  isopentenyl diphosphate  synthesis;  enzymatic phytoene formation reactions;  the desaturation  of phytoene to lycopene;  cyclization and the formation of α- and β-carotenes; and  the synthesis of carotenes derivatives  <cit> .

there are two suggested pathways for ipp synthesis: the acetate-mevalonate pathway beginning with acetate in cytosol and the phosphoglyceraldehyde-pyruvate pathway beginning with pyruvate in chloroplasts  <cit> . there are no identified unique sequences encoding mevalonate kinase , phosphomevalonate kinase  or mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase , which are all required for the former pathway. in contrast, most of enzyme-coding genes involved in the latter pathway have been identified, and they encode 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase , 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase , 4--2-c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase , 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol  <dig> -cyclodiphosphate synthase  and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-diphosphate synthase . however, several unique sequences encoding the rest of the enzymes, including 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidyltransferase  and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase  in this pathway, were unfortunately missed . it appears that m. incisa may utilize glucose as the sole carbon source to synthesize carotenoids, which is the same as that in chlorella and scenedesmus <cit> .

products generated from the first step include ipp and dimethylallyl diphosphate , which may be interconverted by the catalysis of ipp isomerase . the condensation of three ipp molecules and one dmapp molecule  is catalyzed by geranyl diphosphate synthase , farnesyl diphosphate synthase  and geranyl-geranyl diphosphate synthase  in a step-by-step manner to generate geranyl-geranyl diphosphate . in addition to being the precursor for carotenoids, ggpp is also the precursor of several other groups of metabolites including chlorophylls, ubiquinones and tocopherols. therefore, following the condensation of two molecules of ggpp by phytoene synthase  to form phytoene is a committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis. phytoene subsequently undergoes four steps to form lycopene by the sequential catalysis of phytoene desaturase , ζ-carotene desaturase , ζ-carotene isomerase  and carotenoid isomerase . in m. incisa, all of the enzymes except ziso that are described in the lycopene formation process were successfully identified .

lycopene is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, including β-carotene, which is responsible for yellow, orange or red pigments, photosynthesis and photo-protection in photosynthetic organisms. the cyclization of the lycopene catalyzed by lycopene ϵ- and β-cyclases is a critical branch-point in carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . in one branch, a single enzyme, lycopene β-cyclase , introduces a β-ring at both ends of lycopene to form β-carotene in a sequential two-step reaction, while in the other branch, lycopene introduces one ϵ- and one β-ring at each end via ϵ-cyc  followed by β-cyc to form α-carotene. unique sequences encoding ϵ-cyc and β-cyc were identified , suggesting that the biosynthesis pathway of β-carotene and α-carotene is present in m. incisa. β-carotene can be hydroxylated by β-carotene hydroxylase  in a two-step reaction to zeaxanthin with β-cryptoxanthin as an intermediate. in green tissues, zeaxanthin can be epoxidized to violaxanthin, and a set of light- and dark-controlled reactions known as the xanthophyll cycle rapidly optimizes the violaxanthin and zeaxanthin concentrations in the cell via the action of zeaxanthin epoxidase  and violaxanthin de-epoxidase , respectively  <cit> . in this transcriptome, unique sequences that encode bch, zep and vde were identified . m. incisa is able to biosynthesize high-value carotenoids including, at the least, the α- and β-carotenes and zeaxanthin and violaxanthin. β-carotene is a precursor for vitamin a biosynthesis, which is important for growth and maintenance of the immune system and good vision  <cit> , and zeaxanthin and violaxanthin are usually used as food colourant. due to this, further exploitation of this ara-rich green microalga could be valuable.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study,  <dig> pyrosequencing provided a global understanding of the biosynthesis pathway in the non-model organism m. incisa. based on the identified unique sequences and the subcellular localization of relevant proteins, a c4-like photosynthetic pathway was found to exist in m. incisa that enables this microalga to survive under low ambient co <dig> <cit> . nearly all unique sequences related to de novo ara biosynthesis and tag accumulation were successfully identified, thus demonstrating a more detailed lipid metabolism pathway. furthermore, the identified unique sequences coding for pdat, caleosin and oil globule-associated proteins helped to elucidate the mechanism of rapid accumulation and oil body formation of tag under nitrogen starvation. in addition, the suggested carotenoid biosynthesis pathway enabled us to exploit this resource in addition to ara production. all these unique sequences described above require functional identification prior to be used for genetically manipulating to enhance products of interest in further study.
