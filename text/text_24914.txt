BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a gram-negative and halophilic bacterium, known as a leading cause of seafood-borne poisoning all over the world . numerous outbreaks of food-borne disease were associated with v. parahaemolyticus infection . most people are infected by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, particularly oysters. v. parahaemolyticus can also cause systemic infection through wound infection  <cit> .

the pathogenesis of v. parahaemolyticus is complex. as we known, v. parahaemolyticus strains contain a number of different virulence factors including adhesins, thermostable direct hemolysin , tdh-related hemoysin , two type iii secretion systems, t3ss <dig> and t3ss <dig>  <cit> . two co-existed type vi secretion systems, t6ss <dig> and t6ss <dig>  would be new virulence factors of v. parahaemolyticus  <cit> . previous studies have found that pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus often carries thermostable direct hemolysin  and/or thermostable-related hemolysin  genes . tdh and trh were first identified as v. parahaemolyticus virulence factors in the 1980s, and then considered as the main toxins which induce cytotoxicity and enterotoxicity . in recently years, though research about regulatory mechanism of virulence has been discovered  <cit> , there were few discussions about the correlation between growth condition and virulence gene expression of v. parahaemolyticus. studies of virulence factors have made remarkable progress, while the synergy effect and pathogenicity of them are still under investigation  <cit> .

the rapid development of metabolomics introduced a powerful way to study the pathogenesis of diseases by analyzing the metabolites of patients and monitoring the alteration of biomarkers in the course of diseases  <cit> . metabolomics could be valued as a new vision for characterization of a pathogen during its growth and infection process. it has been confirmed that there is correlation between genes and metabolites in e. coli  <cit> , but little attention has been paid to the analysis of the metabolome for better understanding the pathogenesis of v. parahaemolyticus. so it is meaningful to research the virulence gene expression, the metabolic situation of v. parahaemolyticus, and most significantly, the correlationship between them.

previous research of our group has detected tdh and tlh expression in v. parahaemolyticus by reverse transcription real-time pcr   <cit>  and distinguished different pathogenic v. parahaemolyticus strains based on metabolic profiling  <cit> . this research focused on investigating the correlation between the virulence gene expression of v. parahaemolyticus and its metabolites induced at three temperatures, for better understanding its pathogenesis and monitoring typical virulent v. parahaemolyticus strains. three temperatures,  <dig>   <dig> and 37 °c, were chosen as the incubation temperatures for simulating the storage temperature of fresh aquatic products, environmental temperature and human body temperature. the tdh and trh gene were chosen as the virulence genes to be studied in this research. relative virulence gene expression of two standard pathogenic strains of v. parahaemolyticus, atcc <dig>  and atcc <dig> , were performed by rt-qpcr. metabolic profiling of v. parahaemolyticus was determined by ultra performance liquid chromatography & quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry . furthermore, the relationship between metabolome and virulence gene expression was explored by pearson’s correlation analysis.

RESULTS
virulence gene expression of v. parahaemolyticus
the virulence gene expression of two genotypes of v. parahaemolyticus were investigated by rt-qpcr under different culture conditions . both pvua and pvsa were used as the reference genes due to the bias which may be caused by the fluctuation in expression level of a single reference gene  <cit> . the expression levels of tdh induced at 25 °c in v. parahaemolyticus atcc <dig>  were approximately two-fold higher than those induced at  <dig> and 37 °c  . the expression of the trh gene presented the same trend in v. parahaemolyticus atcc <dig>  .fig.  <dig> relative quantifications of gene expressions and metabolites in v. parahaemolyticus. a

typical uplc & q-tof ms chromatograms of v. parahaemolyticus were analyzed. according to uplc-ms data, over  <dig> peaks were determined in the two strains of bacteria grown at  <dig>   <dig> and 37 °c. every peak was identified as a certain metabolite by searching its value of m/z in hmdb. the value of relative concentration of metabolite was used for statistical analysis . the number of identified peaks, total numbers of identified metabolites, and numbers of metabolites changed significantly and numbers of metabolites highly correlated with tdh/trh expression level were shown in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> and  <dig> kinds of metabolites changed with incubation temperature significantly in atcc <dig> and atcc <dig>  respectively. heatmaps were employed to visualize the variations of metabolites concentration, which containing hierarchical clustering on the left . metabolites which were arranged nearby have similar variational rules of concentrations in different temperatures. the significantly changed metabolites could be classified into different categories by chemical taxonomy, such as alkaloids and derivatives, benzenoids, lipids and lipid-like molecules, nucleosides, nucleotides, and analogues, organic acids and derivatives, organoheterocyclic compounds, phenylpropanoids and polyketides .table  <dig> metabolic profiling of v. parahaemolyticus grown at different temperatures

discussion
v. parahaemolyticus, a major seafood-derived pathogen which can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, has attracted more and more interest especially in its virulence in recent years  <cit> . two virulence genes expression and metabolites profile were investigated at different incubation temperature. the relationship between them was explored for the first time.

in this study, both tdh and trh gene expression showed a similar trend, that the expression level reached highest at 25 °c. these results suggested that though 37 °c was regularly used as the culturing temperature in v. parahaemolyticus for simulating actual environmental condition in the human gut, 25 °c was more conducive for virulence gene expression in culture medium.

of thousands of metabolites, 200– <dig> kinds of them mainly changed, which including low-molecular-weight organic acids, amino acids, alcohols, ketones, esters, sugars and others. these same categories of metabolites were also detected in other microorganism, such as yeast  <cit>  and listeria monocytogenes  <cit> . ewald et al. reported that the concentration of intracellular metabolites was determined by the molecular integration of genomic and environmental factors  <cit> . meanwhile, the metabolic study on e. coli suggested that the concentration of some metabolites changed along with a certain gene mutation in continuous cultures  <cit> . thus, the concentration of various metabolites in microorganisms may result from the change of culturing condition and gene expression.

so we hypothesized that there is a correspondence between metabolome and virulence gene expression; and both of them are impacted by culturing temperature.

in this study, based on statistical analysis,  <dig> and four metabolites showed extremely significant correlation with tdh and trh gene expression, respectively. the alteration rules of metabolites and virulence gene expression are correlated together by the regulation of culturing temperature. not much research is available about discussing metabolites and their function in the life cycle of microorganism. nevertheless we found a few possible connections between several of them or characteristics in metabolic process. 3d, 7d, 11d-phytanic acid is a branched chain fatty acid, and could be a kind of fatty-acid metabolic intermediate. it undergoes α-oxidation in the cytosol, where it is converted into pristanic acid by the removal of one carbon  <cit> . in the third process of α-oxidation, 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-coa is cleaved by 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-coa lyase in a tpp-dependent reaction to form pristanal and formyl-coa. tpp consists of a pyrimidine ring which is connected to a thiazole ring, which is in turn connected to a pyrophosphate functional group. coincidentally, pyrophosphate changes with 3d, 7d, 11d-phytanic acid at the same trend in our data suggesting they might be involved in the same metabolic pathway. lysope) is a lysophosphatidylethanolamine  or a lysophospholipid . it could transfer to different derivatives by simple enzymatic action. some lpls serve important signaling functions  <cit>  in cells and might be a signal molecule for answering the alteration of environmental factors. homoarecoline, isolated from betel nuts, belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alkaloids and derivatives of arecoline. arecoline is known to be a partial agonist of muscarinic acetylcholine m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> receptors and m <dig>   which is believed to be the primary cause of its parasympathetic effects. arecoline has also been used medicinally as an antihelmintic  <cit> . in addition, dg, dg, exo-2-methyl-3-methylenebicycloheptan-2-ol and glucosylceramide , are lipids or lipid-like molecules in v. parahaemolyticus atcc33846; 5-- <dig> -benzenediol and zucchini factor b are benzene and substituted derivatives in v. parahaemolyticus atcc <dig> 

we believe that once increasing experimental evidences are explored in metabolic pathways, these metabolites which have been screened out could be developed as biomarkers or regulators for v. parahaemolyticus in future research. new biomarkers would be helpful in monitoring and rapid detection of virulence factors; some metabolites could be used as regulatory factors to control the growth of bacteria; and some potential metabolites might be developed as new drugs to treat diseases caused by v. parahaemolyticus.

CONCLUSIONS
this study proved that there is a correlation between the metabolome and virulence gene expression, under different culturing temperatures. this relationship provides a new perspective for better monitoring virulence performance and understanding pathogenesis of this bacteria. moreover, some certain metabolites could be developed as biomarkers in future research of vibrio parahaemolyticus.
