BACKGROUND
dinoflagellates play critical roles in marine ecosystems as primary producers and grazers of other bacterial and eukaryotic plankton  <cit> . approximately one-half of the ca.  <dig>  species of dinoflagellates contain plastids, although many are mixotrophic  <cit> . many taxa produce potent toxins and form harmful algal blooms, or "red tides", resulting from populations of more than  <dig> million cells per liter of seawater. the toxins cause a variety of poisonings that affect humans and marine wildlife  <cit>  and have a significant impact on coastal ecosystems throughout the world  <cit> . yet, other dinoflagellates, like symbodinium, are central contributors to the health of reef ecosystems as the symbionts of corals  <cit> . loss of the dinoflagellate symbiont results in coral bleaching. in addition to their ecological role, dinoflagellates display some fascinating and unique aspects of cell biology. one intriguing character is nuclear biology. the nucleus of dinoflagellates is unlike that of any other eukaryote because the chromosomes are condensed throughout the cell cycle except during dna replication  <cit> . the morphologically similar chromosomes are attached to the nuclear envelope and can number in the hundreds  <cit> . dinoflagellates also lack nucleosomes  <cit> , instead the nuclear dna is associated with basic proteins that are moderately similar to bacterial histone-like proteins . dinoflagellates were thought to lack histones  <cit> , but in a recent gene expression study, a putative histone h <dig> was annotated in pyrocystis lunula, although the sequence was not analyzed further  <cit> . the general lack of nucleosomes raises many questions about transcription and gene regulation in these organisms. dinoflagellate nuclei also contain vast amounts of dna compared to other eukaryotes. estimates range from  <dig> –  <dig> pg·cell- <dig>  or approximately  <dig>  –  <dig>  megabases   <cit> . in comparison, human nuclei contain  <dig>  pg·cell- <dig> . the dinoflagellate nucleus contains such a high concentration of dna that it exists in a liquid crystal state, which is responsible for the unique morphology  <cit> . the dna to basic protein ratio of dinoflagellate chromosomes has been estimated to be 10: <dig>  which is dramatically higher than the 1: <dig> ratio observed in most eukaryotes. this indicates that very little basic protein is associated with dinoflagellate chromosomes and that the crystal structure is the primary cause of the unusual morphology. dinoflagellates are also the only eukaryotes to contain hydroxymethyluracil, a deaminated nucleotide that can be produced by oxidative damage of dna, which replaces  <dig> – 70% of the thymidine  <cit> . the role of polyploidy or potentially, genome amplification within particular life history stages remains to be clarified for dinoflagellates. it is highly unlikely, however, given their relatively simple morphology that the immense dna content is explained solely by gene content.

the most widespread plastid in dinoflagellates contains the unique photopigment peridinin. the "peridinin plastid" is remarkably different from this organelle in other eukaryotes because it lacks a typical genome. plastids normally contain a circular genome of about  <dig> kb that encodes  <dig> –  <dig> genes that are necessary for plastid function. in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, the plastid genome has been broken into minicircles that encode a single, or a few genes per circle. however, only  <dig> genes have been identified thus far on minicircles  <cit> . recent studies show that most of the plastid genes have been transferred to the nucleus  <cit>  with  <dig> of these genes found exclusively on the plastid genome in all other photosynthetic eukaryotes  <cit> . the peridinin dinoflagellates encode therefore the smallest number of plastid genes of any photosynthetic eukaryote, making them a model for understanding organellar gene transfer. nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are targeted to the plastid using a tripartite n-terminal targeting signal  <cit> . as in euglena, nuclear-encoded plastid proteins are co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum and embedded in this membrane using a stop-transfer sequence in the n-terminus. through algal endosymbioses, the dinoflagellates have been able to acquire four other types of plastids from distantly related evolutionary lineages including the haptophytes, cryptophytes, diatoms, and prasinophytes  <cit> . this aspect of their evolutionary history highlights the unmatched ability of dinoflagellates to capture and retain foreign plastids.

alexandrium tamarense is one of the best-studied dinoflagellates. this species forms toxic blooms and causes paralytic shellfish poisoning through saxitoxin production. it has a peridinin-containing plastid and in north america, a. tamarense blooms from alaska to southern california in the pacific and along the canadian and new england coasts in the atlantic. there has been a recent increase in blooms of a. tamarense and other alexandrium species in other parts of the world making this genus of high importance to the world's fisheries. we undertook a gene discovery project with this organism using expressed sequence tag  data to investigate dinoflagellate evolution and to create a genomic resource for scientists working on different aspects of a. tamarense and dinoflagellate biology. the est method was the most reasonable approach in this case because haploid a. tamarense cells contain approximately  <dig> chromosomes and have a genome size of  <dig> pg/cell . our est results comprise the first extensive high-throughput, genome-wide data set for a dinoflagellate.

RESULTS
clustering and sequence analyses
the collection of  <dig>  ests comprised of single-pass 3'-reads  from a. tamarense was assembled into  <dig>  clusters. the normalized library showed a high degree of complexity, with a novelty rate of  <dig> % and about 52% of the sequenced clones contained inserts that were longer than the single sequence read . clustering of the total est set showed that most of the reads were singletons  and the largest cluster was comprised of  <dig> ests that are closely related to hlps . other highly represented transcripts were those encoding luciferin-binding protein  and several photosynthetic proteins . several large clusters were transcripts that lacked a similarity  to known proteins. one of these ests has an open reading frame that encodes a protein with a potential plastid-targeting signal . interestingly, database searches against ncbi's nr and dbest returned hits only to other dinoflagellate ests. another of the largest clusters only had hits to ests from other dinoflagellates . these two proteins are therefore candidates for dinoflagellate-specific proteins.

each cluster was searched against the swissprot protein database using blastx. a total of  <dig> hits with an e-value less than 1e- <dig> were identified that terminated within  <dig> amino acids of the end of the swissprot entry. from these hits, we estimated that the 3'-utrs ranged in length from  <dig> –  <dig> nt with a mean length of  <dig> nt. this is shorter than the average length observed for fungi  and metazoans   <cit> . however, this analysis is likely to be an underestimate of the average 3'-utr length because only ests that were sequenced into the coding region were included in the analysis. the 3'-utrs of a. tamarense cdnas are also interesting because of their apparent lack of a polya signal. both simple n-mer searches  and the gibb's sampler were used to assay the canonical region from - <dig> to - <dig> preceding the polyadenylation site in search of a polyadenylation signal. we were unable to find a single or a related set of hexamers or pentamers that are enriched in the 3'-utrs . clearly, polyadenylation of transcripts occurs in a. tamarense, however, the mechanism by which this process takes place apparently does not involve a typical polya signal. these ests were also analyzed for gc-content and codon usage. coding region gc-content was  <dig> %, whereas gc-content in the 3'-utr was slightly less at  <dig> %. the gc-content is reflected in the codon usage , whereby 3rd positions are strongly biased towards gs or cs. the stop codon tga is also significantly favoured over tag and taa . the accession numbers of swissprot hits with an e-value of 9e- <dig> and below  were submitted to the protogo server for go category assignment  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  of the swissprot accession numbers could be assigned to go categories. the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  the functional distribution of the a. tamarense ests that could be placed among go categories is typical of other eukaryotes. however, the overall small number  of significant hits to genbank is surprising, suggesting that many a. tamarense proteins may be either highly diverged and/or encode novel dinoflagellate-specific functions , or the sequence does not extend into the coding region of the transcript.

analysis is of  <dig> proteins . third position nucleotide usage was t =  <dig> %, a =  <dig> %, c =  <dig> %, g =  <dig> %. the asterisk  indicates a stop codon.

dinoflagellate gene content and gene families
of species with sequenced genomes, the apicomplexan plasmodium falciparum is the most closely related organism to a. tamarense. both of these species are members of the alveolate lineage with dinoflagellates and apicomplexans forming a monophyletic clade that is sister to the ciliates . sequence comparisons using blast revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> a. tamarense ests had a significant hit  to p. falciparum proteins. the top  <dig> most significant hits are shown in table  <dig>  the most highly conserved proteins between these organisms include many "housekeeping" proteins such as α-tubulin and heat shock protein  <dig>  despite their close evolutionary relationship, there are however likely to be substantial differences between a. tamarense and p. falciparum with respect to gene content. due to the apicomplexan intracellular lifestyle, p. falciparum has lost most of the genes related to plastid function as well as other metabolic genes. many of these same proteins appear in the list of the top blast hits against the nr database of genbank . there were  <dig>  hits to the nr database that were better than 1e- <dig> 

as previously mentioned, our bioinformatic analyses identified  <dig>  clusters of unique genes. however, this is likely to be a conservative estimate of the number of unique transcripts that were sequenced. a combination of short 3'-utrs and highly conserved coding regions caused many related transcripts to be assembled together, even though their 3'-utrs contained sequence differences. for example, two large clusters comprise ests that correspond to the plastid atph gene that encodes the atp synthase c chain. this gene is normally plastid encoded in other photosynthetic eukaryotes. these two clusters form closely related, but clearly distinct sets of transcripts. an additional atph-encoding transcript was identified by a single est. together, the three clusters contain  <dig> ests,  <dig> of which are unique. the n-terminal extensions, which encode the tripartite plastid-targeting signals, share an average  <dig> % nucleotide and  <dig> % amino acid identity, respectively. similar to many other species, the dinoflagellate transit peptides appear to be under selection to maintain hydrophobicity rather than a conserved amino acid sequence. this may explain why the nucleotide conservation is greater than that of the encoded amino acids. five hydrophobic amino acids  are, for example, encoded by codons with a t in the second position. this combined with the high gc-content at third positions results in higher conservation at second and third positions than at first positions. in addition, the high proportion of alanine , leucine , and valine  rather than phenylalanine , isoleucine , methionine , and tyrosine  in the n-terminal extensions may reflect the underlying gc-richness, because alanine, leucine, and valine are encoded by gc-rich codons. it is unclear if these amino acids are evolutionarily selected for specifically, or if they are selected for the combination of their hydrophobic character and the gc-content of their codons. in contrast, the conserved core of the protein shared an average  <dig> % nucleotide and 98% amino acid identity, respectively, which corresponds to the more typical pattern of third position variation resulting from selection. the 3'-utrs of the atph genes show substantial variation and were difficult to align. there are several groups of more closely related 3'-utrs that may be the result of recently duplicated genes. in all, there are five alignable groups of utrs  that may have originated from more closely related genes.

histone and histone-like proteins in dinoflagellates
a significant finding of this study is the identification of two rare  ests that encode a partial histone h2a.x. the longest cdna isolated from the library using pcr was predicted to encoded a protein of  <dig> amino acids that shares high sequence identity to eukaryotic histone h2a.x . this clone putatively lacked only the start codon at the n-terminus. the divergent n-terminus of a. tamarense h2a.x is somewhat longer than in other homologs but the remainder of the sequence is conserved . several functional residues from the known crystal structure are also present in a. tamarense h2a.x including the lysine at the trypsin cleavage site, the arginines in the loops that interact with the dna α-helix, and the lysine ubiquitination site  <cit> . the sites of interaction with histone h2b are also present.

h2a.x proteins are closely related to the canonical h2a except for the c-terminus which contains the distinctive sqΦ motif . h2a.x plays an important role in the recognition and repair of double-strand dna breaks by non-homologous end-joining. at the site of double-strand breaks, the serine of the sqΦ motif is rapidly phosphorylated  <cit> . the phosphorylation signal spreads a large distance down the chromosome around the breaks, signalling the recruitment of the dna repair proteins rad <dig>  rad <dig>  and brca <dig>  <cit> . we also identified histone h2a and h2a.x from the haptophyte emilania huxleyi through high-throughput est sequencing of this alga . phylogenetic analysis places a. tamarense h2a.x in its predicted position  as sister to the e. huxleyi homolog within a group of chromalveolates that includes haptophytes, stramenopiles, and apicomplexans . h2a.x from a. tamarense, e. huxleyi, and toxoplasma gondii do not, however, form a monophyletic group suggesting multiple origins within chromalveolates. this is not surprising because h2a.x appears to have arisen independently many times during eukaryotic evolution  <cit> .

we tested the strength of these results using the approximately unbiased  statistical test. a 16-taxon ml backbone tree was generated without a. tamarense h2a.x and then we made a set of 17-taxon trees by placing this sequence on every possible branch . this analysis provides good support for the position shown in figure 3b , however, many alternative positions were included in the 5% confidence set of trees . the lack of robust phylogenetic signal for the divergence point of a. tamarense h2a.x likely reflects the short length and high conservation of these histones.

dinoflagellate chromosomes do not contain nucleosomes, instead the dna is associated with hlps  <cit> . the similarity between dinoflagellate hlps and bacterial hu and hlps has only recently been noted and these proteins have not yet been subjected to phylogenetic analysis with a broad taxon sampling  <cit> . in our a. tamarense est data, hlps were the most highly represented transcripts  and encoded  <dig> closely related proteins. alignment of the hlps from a. tamarense and other dinoflagellates with hlps and hu proteins from bacteria and eukaryotes showed moderate sequence similarity . this alignment was constructed using information from secondary structure predictions .

one group of proteins  is more closely related to dinoflagellate hlps and includes bph <dig> from bordetella pertussis. bph <dig> has a role in virulence gene expression and shares limited  sequence similarity with histone h <dig>  <cit> . the dinoflagellate and bacterial hlps also contain an n-terminal extension in comparison to hu proteins. this extension is rich in alanine, lysine, and proline, which is reminiscent of the c-terminus of histone h <dig>  the dinoflagellate hlp n-termini are however, also enriched in methionines. compared to the bacterial hlps, this n-terminal region is generally shorter in the dinoflagellates, although there is variability among species in both groups . in contrast to the primary sequence, secondary structure predictions for these three classes of proteins are remarkably similar. the crystal structure of e. coli hu has been determined  and the known secondary structure was compared to the predicted secondary structures of b. pertussis bph <dig> and an a. tamarense hlp . both types of hlps are predicted to have two α-helices that are identical in size and spacing to the n-terminal helices in e. coli hu, followed by two β-strands that are similar in size and position. we conclude from this analysis that dinoflagellate hlps show structural similarity to hu proteins from bacteria, however, it is unclear if these proteins are functional homologs. it is also apparent that dinoflagellate hlps are distantly related to bacterial hu proteins. the dinoflagellates have one putatively homologous functional residue corresponding to lys <dig>  of hu proteins, which interacts with the dna and is involved in wrapping the dna around the protein  <cit> . a proline residue , which intercalates into the dna during hu binding, appears to be conserved among hu proteins and bacterial hlps, but is not present in the dinoflagellate hlps  <cit> . however, there are several prolines conserved among dinoflagellates in the c-terminal end of the protein. the c-terminal arms of hu are critical for the interactions that bend the dna. given the low level of sequence similarity and the absence of a homologous proline in this region, it is unclear if the dinoflagellate hlps are able to interact with dna in the same manner as hu proteins.

in our phylogenetic analyses, the proteobacterial hlps form a well-supported monophyletic group with the dinoflagellates  suggesting an origin of the dinoflagellate gene through lateral transfer . it is also noteworthy that dinoflagellates are the only eukaryotes to possess a proteobacterial form ii rubisco  <cit> . the position of the dinoflagellate hlps is distinct from that of other eukaryotic hu proteins. these latter proteins group with the canonical hu proteins from bacteria and have likely originated through intracellular transfer from the mitochondrial or plastid endosymbiont. statistical support for the monophyly of the dinoflagellate and proteobacterial hlps was tested using the au-test. in these analyses , a sister group relationship between the hlps was the most highly favored topology  and all other positions for the dinoflagellates  had significantly lower probabilities .

dinoflagellates no longer use the nucleosome as the major dna packaging protein complex. chromosomal dna strands in these taxa are smooth, in contrast to the "beads on a string" conformation in other eukaryotes  <cit> . the chromosome structure is also unique in that they are uniform in size and morphology, remain condensed throughout the cell cycle, and are birefringent, indicating a liquid crystal state  <cit> . transcription is thought to take place in dna loops that protrude from the condensed chromosome  <cit> . it appears that dinoflagellates have acquired dna binding proteins from a proteobacterium possibly to facilitate the compaction of their immense genomes. hu and related proteins from bacteria induce sharp bends in dna strands and some models suggest that hlps are responsible for creating dna bends at the periphery of the chromosomes  <cit> . immunolocalization shows dinoflagellate hlp to be associated with the periphery of chromosomes  <cit> .

however, the hlp concentration is very low relative to dna content. dinoflagellate chromosomes have a 1: <dig> protein:dna ratio . the hlp concentration may therefore be too low to function in dna compaction, rather they may act as transcriptional regulators  <cit> .

in summary, our discovery of h2a.x in a. tamarense shows that, whereas dinoflagellates appear to no longer use nucleosomes for dna packaging, at least one histone has been retained and is weakly expressed. interestingly, in a recent paper, histone h <dig> appears in a table of redox-regulated genes in the dinoflagellate pyrocystis lunula  <cit> . until now, only these two histones have been identified in dinoflagellates and it is unclear if all dinoflagellates possess either of these two genes, or others that have not yet been found. if other histones are present , they may however also be expressed at a low level . this would render difficult their identification using the est-based approach unless comprehensive sequencing of normalized and subtracted cdna libraries is used. in metazoans, replication-dependant canonical histone  mrnas are not polyadenylated, raising the possibility that they have been excluded from this poly-a primed cdna library  <cit> . however, these histone mrnas are polyadenylated in plants, apicomplexans, and ciliates, suggesting that if they are present, they may be in dinoflagellates as well  <cit> . given the important role that h2a.x plays in dna repair, we speculate that this gene may have been maintained specifically to perform this function. consistent with this idea, the core region of a. tamarense h2a.x is highly conserved, indicating that it may still be able to interact with dna in a manner similar to h2a in other species.

CONCLUSIONS
this collection of ests is the most extensive genomic resource for a toxic dinoflagellate species to date and provides a useful glimpse into its nuclear genome. these data will be instrumental to future research to understand the unique and complex cell biology of these organisms and for understanding the method of toxin production in these species. we have likely not yet exhausted the gene discovery potential using the est approach . in the future, we will use serial subtraction of cdna libraries to improve/maintain the novelty rate of our cdna library and create cdna libraries from a. tamarense under various growth conditions and life history stages to get generate a more complete catalog of the gene content of this important organism.
