BACKGROUND
small rnas are a group of regulatory molecules that fall into two major classes, micrornas  and short interfering rnas . they play important roles in biological systems in eukaryotes by suppressing expression of target genes at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level through specific base pairing with their targets  <cit> . in plants, sirnas are further classified into trans-acting sirnas , natural antisense transcript-derived sirnas , and repeat-associated sirnas   <cit> . in addition, a novel class of bacteria-induced 30- to 40-nt endogenous small rnas, long sirnas , was identified in arabidopsis  <cit> .

as an important group of small rnas, mirna has attracted much attention. a number of studies have been performed to reveal the biogenesis of mirnas and the mechanisms of mirna-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . in plants, mirna derives from primary mirna transcript , which is transcribed by rna polymerase ii. after formation of a stem-loop secondary structure  <cit> , pri-mirna is cleaved twice by dicer-like <dig> , a rnase iii enzyme  <cit> . the first cleavage of dcl <dig> releases a mirna precursor , and the second cleavage of dcl <dig> generates a pair of mirna/mirna* duplex. the mature mirna targets mrna by being incorporated into the rna-induced silencing complex  and plays a role in regulation of gene expression  <cit> , while mirna*, the complementary strand of the mature mirna, is usually degraded and applies no function  <cit>  although functional mirna* has been reported  <cit> . in plants, mirnas have been demonstrated to be involved in many biological and metabolic processes, including developmental regulation, growth control, cell differentiation, signal transduction, and biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . for example, mir <dig> regulates floral organ identity and flowering time by cleavage and/or translational repression of ap2-domain containing genes  <cit> ; mir <dig> has been shown to be required for normal anther development by mediating the expression of gamyb-related genes  <cit> .

unlike mirnas, endogenous sirnas arise from loci, in which double-stranded rnas are able to be formed by the action of rna-dependent polymerase or by two convergent transcripts. ta-sirnas are 21-nt phased small rnas and function like mirnas. tas <dig> is conserved in many plant species. in arabidopsis and rice four and three tas loci have been identified, respectively  <cit> . besides ta-sirnas, other types of phased small rnas have also been reported recently, such as mirna-like sirnas from long hairpin  <cit>  and phased small rnas from superclusters flanked by a common 22-nt motif targeted by mir <dig>  <cit> .

as the major compounds of tobacco , nicotine alkaloids have defensive functions in response to pathogen infection and herbivore wounding. studies on alkaloids have been focused on the harm of smoking cigarettes and addictions to nicotine  <cit> . the potential use of nicotine alkaloids as insecticides in agriculture has also been investigated  <cit> . nicotine alkaloids are synthesized in tobacco roots and delivered to leaves through the plant transport systems, consequently nicotine alkaloids are mainly accumulated in leaves in most nicotiana species  <cit> . nicotine biosynthesis can be induced through topping or leaf wounding to tobacco plants  <cit>  and significant increase of nicotine content was observed in the wounded tobacco plants  <cit> . in the past  <dig> years, a series of genes involved in the nicotine biosynthetic pathways have been identified, e.g. pmt   <cit> ; mpo   <cit> ; qpt   <cit>  and a <dig>  <cit> . however, it is unclear whether samll rnas are responsive to wounding and are involved in induction of nicotines upon wounding.

over  <dig>  mirnas  and several kinds of sirnas have been identified in plants. recently, identification of known conserved mirnas has been reported in tobacco  <cit> . however, no tobacco-specific mirna has been experimentally isolated. in this study, we intend to experimentally indentify mirnas and sirnas in the tobacco genome, especially small rnas responsive to damages through high-throughput sequencing of small rna populations from wounding or topping treated tobacco plants. to identify potential targets of small rnas, a degradome from wounding treated plants was sequenced. as a result,  <dig> known and novel tobacco-specific mirnas together with a number of loci generating phased small rnas were identified. expression levels of some of these small rnas were changed after wounding or topping treatment, suggesting that these small rnas may play a defensive role in response to wounding or topping damage in tobacco.

RESULTS
deep sequencing reveals a diverse set of tobacco small rnas
to get insight into the composition of small rna populations and their changes after damage treatments in tobacco, we isolated small rnas from roots and leaves of leaf-wounding-treated plant, roots of topping-treated plant and roots of untreated plant. small rnas were then sequenced using the illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. a total of  <dig>  million of raw reads  were generated from four samples . similar to previous reports on small rna cloning in other plant species, 20-24-nt reads were dominated in all four small rna populations with the 24-nt small rnas the most abundant species . of the 20-24-nt reads,  <dig> % and  <dig> % were perfectly mapped to the tobacco genome initiative  gss and est datasets . many small rnas were singletons or observed only in one sample. less than 3% of the small rna reads were common in all four samples. these results illustrate the complexity of the tobacco small rna populations, which might partly be due to tetraploid characteristic of tobacco.

#only 19-25-nt reads were counted

identification of mirnas and loci generating phased small rnas
mirna identification
we searched mirbase for tobacco homologs of known mirnas. as a result, homologs of  <dig> known mirna families were found in our dataset. based on blast search against the tobacco gss and est databases, we found that the mature mirnas of these  <dig> known mirna families match to  <dig> distinct gss or est sequences. all these sequences are able to form stem-loop structures; therefore they were considered as pre-mirnas . although  <dig> of these  <dig> mirna families has been shown to be conserved in tobacco previously using a computational approach  <cit> , our experimental approach confirmed the conservation of additional five mirnas  in tobacco, which were not found computationally. forty-four computationally identified tobacco mirna families were not detected in our dataset, which could be because these mirnas are lowly expressed and remain undetectable at the sequencing depth in our experiments or alternatively they are expressed in specific tissues that are not sampled in our experiments.

to identify novel tobacco mirnas, we developed a mirna discovery pipeline . using the custom-designed pipeline, we identified  <dig> novel tobacco mirnas belonging to  <dig> families . of these  <dig> novel mirna families,  <dig> families  had a 21-nt mature mirna sequences. of these  <dig> families,  <dig> families  had a mature mirnas started with u. these results well supported the mirna identity of these newly identified mirnas. of the  <dig> novel mirna families,  <dig> families  had a 22-nt mature mirnas, which have been shown to be the secondary sirna triggers  <cit> . whether these 22-nt novel mirnas play a role in the biogenesis of secondary sirnas is waiting to be investigated. twenty-seven of the  <dig> novel mirna families contain only one member, suggesting their relatively recent origin.

identification of loci generating phased small rnas
to identify loci generating phased small rnas, small rna clusters were first defined based on the number of small rnas aligned to a certain length of sequence segment and the relative distance between neighbouring small rnas  <cit> . using the criteria mentioned in methods, we identified  <dig> - <dig>  21-nt clusters and  <dig> - <dig>  24-nt clusters in four samples . as expected, there were more 24-nt clusters than 21-nt clusters. these small rna clusters were then analysed using the methodology described previously to see whether the small rnas within these clusters distributed in a phased pattern, which was determined by a phase score <cit> . a higher phase score indicates a stronger phase signal. with a phase score of  <dig>  as suggested previously  <cit> , we found that 189- <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  loci were able to produce 21-nt and 24-nt phased small rnas in four samples, respectively. the number of loci generating phased small rnas was significantly reduced when the phase score was increased to  <dig> . these loci are shown in additional file 2: table s <dig>  and five representative loci generating 21-nt- or 24-nt-phased small rnas are shown in figure  <dig> 

loci homologous to known house-keeping noncoding rnas, such as rrna, trna, snrna and snorna and overlapped with repeat sequences were excluded. the phase scores  were calculated following the description in howell et al.  <cit> 

in plants, the typical loci generating phased sirnas are tass  <cit> . tas <dig> with the mir <dig> cleavage sites has been found to be conserved in plants, including tobacco. in this study, we experimentally confirmed the conservation of tas <dig> in tobacco. at least one tas <dig> gene  with two mir <dig> binding sites and generating the conserved ta-siarfs was confidently identified with a phase score of  <dig> . we searched targeting sites of the newly identified mirnas in this study in loci with a phase score over  <dig>  and found several such loci were potentially targeted by nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir <dig> or nta-mir <dig>  whether these novel mirnas are involved in biogenesis of the phased small rnas observed is waiting to be investigated experimentally.

identification of small rna targets by degradome sequencing
targets of mirnas
recently, degradome sequencing has been successfully applied to identify targets of mirnas in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . taking the advantage of this new approach, we sequenced a degradome library constructed using total rna isolated from roots of leaf-wounding treated tobacco plants. over  <dig> million of raw reads were generated. out of  <dig>  unique clean reads , representing ~ <dig>  million of raw reads,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  were mapped to tobacco ests and gsss, respectively. these mappable reads were then used for target gene identification using the cleaveland pipeline as described  <cit> .

one or more targets were uncovered for  <dig> conserved and five tobacco-specific mirna families . these targets were classified into five categories following the description indicated in the software cleaveland  <dig>  six representative mirna targets identified by degradome sequencing were shown in figure  <dig>  fourteen targets of seven mirna families were fallen into category  <dig> and  <dig>  for which the most abundant cleavage signal was detected at the expected mirna-mediated cleavage sites. functions of the conserved mirna target genes are evolutionary conserved between different plants, including tobacco. for example, mir <dig> has been shown to regulate expression of arf  genes in arabidopsis and tomato  <cit> . our results showed that arf is one of the potential targets of mir <dig> in tobacco, suggesting a conserved role of mir <dig> in tobacco. similarly, conserved targets were also identified for mir <dig>  and mir <dig>  . however, conserved mirnas might have non-conserved function in tobacco, for instance, salicylic acid-induced protein  <dig>  which has been reported to have multiple functions in defense response in tobacco  <cit> , was the only target found for mir <dig>  suggesting that mir <dig> could be part of the defensive pathway involving the salicylic acid signal.

the newly identified mirnas were found to have diverse targets, but most of them seem to have a role in stress responses, suggesting that most of the newly identified mirnas could function as regulators of defensive pathways in tobacco. for example, our degradome sequencing result showed that nta-mir <dig> targets a gene encoding avr9/cf- <dig> rapidly elicited protein  <dig> , which plays a role in resistance to wounding and mechanical stress in tobacco  <cit> . nta-mir <dig> targets genes encoding nematode resistance-like protein and ankyrin repeat containing protein, both are induced upon infection of disease  <cit> .

targets of phased small rnas
one of the phased small rnas generated from the tas <dig> locus is ta-siarf, which targets arf genes that influence leaf morphology and lateral root growth  <cit> . to know whether the phased small rnas identified in this study, like ta-siarf, are able to regulate expression of other genes, we checked the presence of potential targets of the most abundant  <dig> phased small rnas observed in the damage-treated samples in our degradome sequencing dataset. we found targets for five  of the  <dig> selected phased small rnas . for example, the d <dig> phased small rna from locus fh <dig>  which was specifically detected in wounding or topping treated samples, was found to target an hypothetical protein; the d <dig> phased small rna from locus et <dig> was found to target several genes with diverse functions, including putative disease resistance protein, dicer-like protein and type-a phytochrome.

we did gene ontology  analysis for the target genes of mirnas and phased small rnas. although mirnas and phased small rnas had most of their targets grouped into the same go terms, including response to stimulus and immune system process, it seems that mirnas and the phased small rnas are targeting specific genes involved in reproduction  and cellular component biogenesis and organization , respectively , suggesting a unique role of mirnas and the pahsed small rnas in these processes.

small rnas responsive to topping and wounding treatments
topping and wounding responsive mirnas
in order to compare expression levels of small rnas in different samples, the abundance of each unique small rna was normalized by converting the absolute read numbers to relative read numbers  based on the total number of reads in each library. to get insight into the potential role of mirnas in response to damage treatments, we compared the expression changes of all mirnas detected in our datasets. most of the mirnas identified in this study changed their expression upon topping or wounding treatment. eight conserved and seven newly identified mirnas showed significant up-regulation or down-regulation upon damage treatment . out of the eight conserved mirnas, mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been previously shown to be stress-responsive  <cit> . mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly induced in roots by both topping and wounding treatments. mir <dig> and mir <dig> were significantly induced only in roots treated by wounding. furthermore, mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> were up-regulated only in topping treated sample while were down-regulated or remaining unchanged in wounding treated sample. these results indicate different mirna families behave differently upon damage treatment, suggesting a different role of these mirnas in response to damage treatment in tobacco. in addition, seven conserved mirna families  were not detected in the untreated tobacco root sample but were detected in at least one damage treated sample . among these mirnas, mir <dig> and mir <dig> have been shown to response to a variety of stresses  <cit> .

to confirm the deep sequencing results, the expression levels of mir156a, mir <dig> and mir164a were analysed using northern blot. according to northern results, the expression levels of mir164a and mir156a were higher in roots than in leaves, while the expression levels of mir <dig> were higher in leaves than in roots , consistent with the deep sequencing results ; however, for mir164a, the induction detected by northern analysis was not as significant as that detected by deep sequencing; for mir156a and mir <dig>  a discrepant result was observed in the wounding treated root samples between deep sequencing and northern analysis . the induction observed in deep sequencing results could be an artifact caused by biased adaptor ligation and pcr amplification during the procedure of small rna library construction.

out of the  <dig> newly identified mirna families,  <dig> were relatively highly expressed, particularly nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir <dig> and nta-mir <dig> . northern analysis of nta-mir <dig> showed that this novel mirna is highly expressed in roots but lowly expressed in leaf, consistent with the deep sequencing results. nta-mir <dig> was highly induced by wounding in leaves and slightly induced in roots from the topping treated plants , but a reduction of this mirna in roots from the wounding treated plants detected by deep sequencing was not detected by northern analysis, which could be because of cross hybridization of other members of this mirna family that failed to be detected by deep sequencing. the discrepancy observed between deep sequencing and northern blot analysis suggests that caution must be taken when directly compare small rna expression levels observed by either approach.

nta-mir <dig>  nta-mir4c and nta-mir <dig> were highly induced in roots by both wounding and topping treatments; nta-mir <dig> was highly induced only in topping treated sample . nine newly identified mirna families  were not expressed in the untreated roots but were detected in damage treated samples. different members of the same mirna family could behave differently upon damage treatment, for example, nta-mir4a. <dig> was highly induced by damage treatment, whereas nta-mir4a. <dig> and mir4b were not induced.

topping and wounding responsive phased small rnas
generally, the number of small rna clusters was much higher in the damage treated samples , indicating a number of small rnas could be induced by these treatments. the number of loci generating both 21-nt- and 24-nt-phased small rnas increased dramatically after topping or leaf-wounding treatment. some of these loci were found in two, three or all four samples, but some of them were unique to each treatment . similar to what has been found for mirnas, wounding treated root sample had the most abundant uniquely up-regulated loci that generate phased small rnas . two phased small rnas were analysed using northern blot, but no signal was detected , mainly due to their low expression levels.

discussion
recent computational prediction identified  <dig> potential conserved tobacco mirnas of  <dig> families  <cit> , but computational prediction based on known mirnas is unable to identify novel mirnas and mirnas expressed under specific conditions, such as biotic and abiotic stresses. in this study, we used high-throughput sequencing approach to experimentally confirm expression of the known mirnas and their changes upon wounding or topping treatment, and to identify novel tobacco-specific mirnas. our study detected the expression of  <dig> known mirnas  in tobacco roots and leaves, including mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig> that was not previously computationally identified. more importantly, our work identified  <dig> novel tobacco-specific mirnas .

upon damage treatments, eight conserved and seven newly identified mirnas showed significant up-regulation or down-regulation . in addition, seven conserved and nine newly identified mirna families were only detected in the damage treated sample. the majority of these damage-responsive conserved mirna families have been previously shown to be stress responsive in other plant species, suggesting that these mirnas might also play a positive regulatory role in stress-tolerance in tobacco. in arabidopsis, mir <dig> is essential for floral, leaf and root development  <cit> . we found that this mirna was induced in roots upon wounding or topping treatment  and that one of the targets encodes a salicylic acid-induced protein; therefore, it is possible that mir <dig> is required for homeostasis of defensive proteins in tobacco. in addition, most targets of the newly identified mirnas responsive to topping or wounding, found in the degradome sequencing results, seem to be regulators of various defensive pathways, implicating the importance of these mirnas in stress responses in tobacco.

different damages seem to have different effects on the expression of mirnas and sirnas. the abundance of small rnas in the wounding treated leaf sample was generally much higher than that in the topping and wounding treated root samples, suggesting that the induction of small rnas is more significant in the tissue where the damage was directly applied. induction of small rnas in roots collected from the leaf-wounding plants suggests that a mobile signal responsible for this induction is generated in leaves and transported to roots. this signal is most likely a type of phytohormone, such as salicylic acid, jasmonic acid or ethylene. however the exact nature of this signal is waiting to be resolved.

silencing of rna-directed rna polymerase  <dig>  makes nicotiana attenuata highly susceptible to insect herbivores, suggesting the defense elicitation in nicotiana attenuata is under the direct control of small rnas  <cit> . further investigation has found large-scale changes of small rnas associated with insect elicitation  <cit> . wounding is similar to insect herbivores and induction of small rnas in the wounding treated tobacco plants is consistent with this recent finding. this result suggests that small rnas could play a central role in reprogramming the tobacco transcriptome in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. it is unclear how the stress-transcriptome of tobacco has changed upon wounding or topping, but our work has provided bases for further investigation on roles of small rnas in stress responses in tobacco.

in plants, tass are the noncoding transcripts targeted by mirnas to generate phased small rnas. recent investigation has demonstrated that the 22-nt mirnas, rather than the 21-nt mirnas, are the triggers for production of secondary phased small rnas  <cit> . out of the  <dig> newly identified mirna families,  <dig> families have a 22-nt mirna. in addition, we found that a large number of genomic regions in tobacco are able to produce phased 21-nt or 24-nt small rnas and that a number of these regions containing potential binding sites of the newly identified mirnas. although we did not find these binding sites are enriched for 22-nt mirnas, it is worth to perform further detailed analysis to see if the 22-nt mirnas found in this study play a role in biogenesis of the secondary phased small rnas.

CONCLUSIONS
our study experimentally confirmed the conservation of a number of known mirnas in tobacco, including conserved mirnas that were not previously identified by computational prediction. identification of damage-responsive mirnas and phased small rnas and defense related targets of these small rnas suggest that the inducible defense responses in tobacco might be controlled by pathways involving small rnas.
