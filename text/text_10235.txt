BACKGROUND
bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd <dig> must regulate genes in response to a variety of environmental conditions as it enters, digests, and leaves other gram-negative bacteria, or when it grows axenically without prey  <cit> . discrete waves of enzymes digesting different prey contents are required so that predatory enzymes do not act on each other, as the bdellovibrio changes from a non-replicating “attack-phase” outside the prey, to a growing and replicating state inside prey. the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome encodes several potential sigma factors for rna polymerase which may contribute to such organised waves of gene regulation  <cit> . the bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome has several predicted “housekeeping” sigma factors: gene bd <dig> encoding an rpod sigma  <dig> sigma factor; gene bd <dig>  encoding a flia-like sigma factor and gene bd <dig> encoding an rpon-like sigma factor. in addition, there are two homologues of genes predicted to encode group iv-rpoe-like sigma factors, bd <dig>  and bd <dig> . further, gene bd <dig> is predicted to encode a larger sigma factor homologue  with sigma  <dig> homology.

rpoe-like sigma factors in other bacteria mediate gene expression in response to changes in host/external environment and bacteria with mutations in rpoes can be defective in virulence or other host interactions  <cit> . bd <dig> and bd <dig> predicted proteins show significant homology  to the rpoe gene product of e. coli which encodes a sigma factor of the ecf type that is responsive to extra-cytoplasmic, periplasmic events; rpoe in e. coli is sequestered at the inner membrane by an rsea rseb pair of proteins, until inducing-events, in the shape of abnormally folded proteins in the periplasm, cause it to be released and active  <cit> . the bdellovibrio genome, like that of other delta-proteobacteria, does not contain rseab genes, suggesting that the rpoe-like sigma factors encoded by bd <dig> and bd <dig> belong more generally to the group iv-type sigma factors. unlike some members of this group, the bdellovibrio genes lack the typical downstream co-transcribed gene encoding a product with homology to an anti-sigma factor. indeed the genes  that are immediately downstream of bd <dig> and bd <dig> are unique to the bdellovibrio genome, with no other significant homologues in other bacteria.

we hypothesised that the regulatory functions of alternate group iv sigma factors might be diverse and important in the bdellovibrio lifestyle, where prey-interaction versus prey-independent axenic growth brings with it many different challenges to the cell, including outer membrane insults, and a need for a great deal of de novo protein synthesis. thus we used directed mutagenesis with kanamycin cartridge insertion, to test if inactivation of the three sigma factor genes bd <dig>  bd <dig> and bd <dig>  affected viability and to determine what their regulatory roles in the bdellovibrio axenic and predatory lifestyles may be. we find that one is likely essential, one is involved in regulating predatory processes and one is involved in repression of different components of the groesel chaperone complex, which themselves may have different roles in the predatory lifecycle.

RESULTS
transcriptional studies and bioinformatics show the operon structures for bd <dig> and bd0881
rt-pcr on total rna taken from predatory growth conditions demonstrated that adjacent genes bd0880bd <dig> and bd <dig> are co-transcribed in an operon, but that bd <dig> was not co-transcribed with the adjacent gene bd <dig>  this differs to the situation for group iv sigma factors in other bacteria where the downstream gene usually encodes an anti-sigma-factor  <cit> . alignment of the rpoe protein from e. coli with the predicted gene products from bd <dig> and bd <dig> gave another indication that these bdellovibrio proteins may have different roles from that of e. coli rpoe. amino acids known to bind the − <dig> recognition site in e. coli differ in bd <dig> and bd <dig> as illustrated in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  suggesting that these sigma factors may recognise different sequences to those of e. coli and also to each other. additionally bd <dig> is conserved in the genome of bacteriovorax marinus, a marine bdellovibrio-like bacterium but bd <dig> does not have a strong homologue in that genome. these data were provided by blast analysis hosted by the wellcome trust sanger institute and can be obtained from http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/blast/submitblast/b_marinus.

many of the residues comprising the − <dig> recognition site of e. coli rpoe  are not conserved in b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> , suggesting that these rpoe-like proteins may recognise different dna consensus sequences and correlating with the lack of classical e. coli rpoe consensus sequences in promoters in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome. 

inactivation of sigma factor genes suggests that bd <dig> may be essential
kanamycin resistant cassettes were inserted into the bd0743bd <dig> and bd <dig> genes to disrupt their coding sequences, and knockout mutants were screened for as described previously  <cit> . viable knock-out mutants capable of predation were obtained for bd <dig> and bd <dig>  but they could not be obtained for bd <dig>  despite extensive screening in axenic  and predatory conditions well beyond the bacterial numbers from which the other two mutants were isolated, suggesting that bd <dig> may be essential . bd <dig> is larger than the other rpoe-like sigma factors  with homology to regions  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of sigma  <dig> and so this may be acting as an alternative sigma  <dig> factor guiding the transcription of housekeeping genes which would explain why generating a knock-out mutant was not obtained. top hits from a blast search for bd <dig> are sigma- <dig> genes from many delta-proteobacteria,  further supporting its possible role as an alternative sigma  <dig> protein. some hits from blast were annotated as rpoh, but bd <dig> is unlikely to be rpoh as it lacks the “rpoh box” conserved in these proteins  <cit> . further studies on the groups of genes it regulates is beyond the scope of this manuscript, but it is likely that as bd <dig> is conserved in other delta-proteobacteria, including many non-predatory bacteria, it may not have a specialised predatorily associated function.

luminescent prey assay shows less efficient predation by a bdellovibrio bd <dig> knockout strain
both the Δbd <dig> and Δbd <dig> knockout strains were able to grow predatorily but a predation efficiency assay  <cit>  using luminescent prey cells showed that the Δbd <dig> mutant was less efficient at predation upon e. coli than the Δbd <dig> mutant and the wild-type control . for any given ratio of e. coli to bdellovibrio, the Δbd <dig> strain took longer to reduce light emitted from the luminescent e. coli to half of its maximum, and hence took longer to kill the prey. an extra sum of squares f test carried out using the graphpad prism  <dig> software showed that this difference was significant . this suggests that bd <dig> controls, or optimises, the transcription of some genes involved in the predatory lifestyle while bd <dig> does not and thus bd <dig> is the first experimentally identified bdellovibrio transcriptional regulator of predation genes. axenic, prey-independent growth of both mutants was not significantly different from wild-type and heat shock  did not reduce viability suggesting that they are not acting as typical alternate sigma32-like factors.

previously we have shown  <cit>  that predatory efficiency in liquid media can be affected by the swimming speed of the bdellovibrio which affects how efficiently they enter areas where they collide with prey. interestingly, the transcription of the bd <dig> flic <dig> flagellin gene was found, by rt-pcr on attack phase bdellovibrio rna,  to be significantly down regulated in the Δbd <dig> mutant compared to the Δbd <dig> mutant and the wild type  hd <dig> under heat shock conditions. this suggests that bd <dig> may have some role in regulating the expression of flic <dig>  altering protein composition and thus rigidity and/or the lengths of flagellar filaments in bdellovibrio.

a comparison of the flagellar lengths of the two strains versus wt, at the exact same growth conditions, revealed that the flagellar filaments of Δbd <dig> were slightly but significantly , shorter than those in wild type bdellovibrio. in contrast, those in Δbd <dig> were longer  than the wild type . we have previously shown  <cit>  that flic <dig> deletion shortens flagella and that Δflic <dig> flagellar mutants swim more slowly and prey less efficiently on e. coli in the luminescent prey assay. interestingly, when we compared the swimming speeds of the two strains  we found that the Δbd <dig> cells swam significantly  but only slightly faster than the wild type, however, surprisingly both swam significantly  faster than the Δbd <dig> strain despite it having longer flagellar filaments. thus having a changed flagellin composition in the Δbd <dig> mutant strains produced a longer flagellum but either it had a “flaccid” wave form structure that produced less torque and thus swimming speed, or the Δbd <dig> mutation affected its complement of motor proteins so that the longer flagellum in this strain rotated slower than the wild type. we couldn’t test this by antibody-tethering cells by their flagella to glass slides because the flagella are sheathed with an outer membrane. the effect was a subtle one as the speeds were only slightly altered and the flagella waveforms did not appear to be grossly altered by electron microscopy.

to look for any evidence of association between rpoe-like sigma factor proteins and motility gene expression, we firstly measured the transcription of the  <dig> mota genes in Δbd <dig> and Δbd <dig>  but found no difference compared to wild type . this led us to conclude that bd <dig> does not act at motor regulation and does not produce faster rotating but shorter flagella.

we next tested whether there was an association between the transcriptional expression profiles of the rpoe-like genes and flagellar genes, measuring this by rt-pcr in total rna from across the predatory cycle . we found that the expression patterns for bd <dig> and bd <dig> were constitutive but the expression pattern of bd <dig> was similar to that seen for the key flic <dig> gene of bdellovibrio <cit> ; flic <dig> is the only flagellin gene  whose expression is crucial to flagellar synthesis, and its repression prevents motility of bdellovibrio <cit> .

our results showed that expression of bd <dig> was all but abolished at  <dig> min to  <dig> hour after bdellovibrio addition to prey, and resumed later in the predatory cycle, before prey lysis, as shown in figure  <dig> alongside expression of the critical flic <dig> gene. the expression of the flic <dig> gene initially drops early in the predatory cycle, then resumes as the bdellovibrio are nearing septation and flagella are synthesised prior to prey lysis and progeny escape from the prey cell debris into liquid cultures. thus the similarity in expression patterns of flic <dig> gene and bd <dig> during predation may imply that bd <dig> protein is involved in regulatory events to do with the timepoints where flagella are being synthesised, i.e. around septation, but the fact that Δbd <dig> mutants are not immotile shows that bd <dig> is not required for the “all or nothing” induction of the flic <dig> gene expression itself.

rt-pcr reveals regulation of chaperone genes by bd0743
rt-pcr was used to study the expression of groe chaperone protein genes in wild-type and sigma-factor knockout bdellovibrio strains, as chaperone genes are typically rpoe-regulated in other bacteria, although no obvious e. coli rpoe- like consensus sequence was seen upstream of them in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome. other bacteria induce expression of groe protein chaperones upon heat shock  in order to deal with misfolded proteins  <cit> . furthermore, over-expression of chaperones can aid the expression of high levels of proteins in cells  <cit>  including situations where addition of phage–encoded groes proteins modify the size of protein that the bacterial chaperone can fold, to assemble large phage capsid proteins  <cit> . the bdellovibrio genome has, in addition to the bd0097bd <dig> groes groel genes, a second homologue, bd <dig>  of groes , so we investigated the expression of all these genes by rt-pcr using matched amounts of rna from wild-type and sigma-factor mutant bdellovibrio, treated in attack phase, at different temperatures  using methods previously described  <cit> . in wild-type bdellovibrio, as is the case in many other bacteria, groes1el expression was low at normal bdellovibrio growth temperature  and expression was induced at a higher level under heat shock . this situation was the same for wild type and the Δbd <dig> mutant indicating that the bd <dig> sigma factor is not involved in this heat shock event. in the Δbd <dig> mutant, however, groes1el expression was de-repressed, even in non-heat shock conditions suggesting that the bd <dig> sigma factor controls, directly or indirectly, the repression of groes1el under normal temperature conditions. the viability of the Δbd <dig> cells was not affected under predatory growth conditions as determined by plaque assay indicating that this groe deregulation does not severely affect the cells during laboratory culturing.

the second chaperone gene groes <dig>  was expressed at a very low level, in attack phase cells of in the wild-type and Δbd <dig> mutant, under both normal and heat shock conditions,; suggesting that possibly it is not normally part of the heat shock response and may have a different role outside. in the Δbd <dig> mutant, however, groes <dig> expression was de-repressed in both normal and heat shock conditions, again implying that this sigma factor controls the expression of repressors of chaperone gene expression.

recent work  <cit>  has demonstrated different roles for multiple chaperone groel gene products in the predatory myxococcus including differential roles in predation and so it is possible that a similar situation exists with the duplicate groes gene products of bdellovibrio. the groes <dig> gene was annotated in the b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> genome as encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein, but closer inspection reveals that a more likely start codon is at the methionine at base pair position  <dig> within this orf as the region before this, in the old annotation, includes lots of repetitive sequence. using this start codon, the predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids has 34% identity and 62% similarity with the predicted  groes protein of e. coli, and this 117aa region only of bd <dig> groes <dig> is homologous to all predicted groes sequences of delta-proteobacteria which give the highest blast homology scores for the bd <dig> protein. rt-pcr primers for groes <dig> were designed to anneal to rna encoding this orf and transcription of both groes genes was monitored in rna extracted over a wild type predatory time-course of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> preying upon e. coli . this showed that groes <dig> was upregulated early at  <dig> minutes upon bdellovibrio contact with prey cells and when the bdellovibrio were growing within prey, remaining constitutively expressed throughout the predatory cycle. in contrast groes <dig> was not expressed early but was upregulated later, at 2– <dig> hours in the predation cycle when bdellovibrio were beginning to septate and lyse prey. although there are more bdellovibrio present at this stage of the predatory cycle as a result of replication within the prey, the upregulation is unlikely to solely be a result of this as groes <dig> is not expressed at all in earlier stages of the cycle and so its induction here is significant. rt-pcr was also performed on matched amounts of rna derived from  <dig> different host-independent strains derived from each sigma-factor mutant and a control wild-type  and revealed that groel, groes <dig> and groes <dig> were all expressed at similar levels in each of the mutants in axenic, prey-independent  growth. as  host-independently growing bdellovibrio populations include a mixture of attack phase and filamentous growth stage cells, it is not surprising that all of the chaperones are expressed in these cells.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that of three b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> sigma factor genes with at least partial rpoe homology, one- bd <dig>  is likely essential for bdellovibrio cell life and cannot be deleted. bd <dig> and bd <dig> can be deleted with the bdellovibrio retaining the ability to grow predatorily or prey-independently.

in the case of Δbd <dig> the predatory efficiency was reduced, despite the flagellar motility of the mutant being slightly increased,  thus the change in predation efficiency may not be due to motility changes but regulation of other predatory genes. the bd <dig> gene has an expression pattern across the predatory cycle that is similar to that of the flagellin genes whose expression is required for bdellovibrio motility. that bd <dig> expression is turned off and then resumes at a similar time to flagellin gene expression, during the predatory cycle, implies that bd <dig> may have a role associated with pre-septation developmental maturation of bdellovibrio around the time that flagella are being built in newly dividing cells. however the bd <dig> sigma factor does not directly regulate the expression of flic flagellin or mot flagellar motor genes themselves.

surprisingly, predatory efficiency was not affected in our cultures by the slower swimming speed of the Δbd <dig> sigma factor mutant; this is probably indicative of sufficient mixing of predator and prey at close quarters in lab conditions. the slight increase in flagellar length in Δbd <dig> mutants is likely to have come with the incorporation of a higher percentage of a less rigid flagellin in the flagella causing a less efficient “bow wave” and this may account for the slower swimming. in both the Δbd <dig> and Δbd <dig> mutants, small but significant changes in swimming speed were paradoxically associated with changes apparently in the wrong direction in flagellar length. this shows that it is not simply flagellar length that governs the thrust produced by flagellar propellers. in previous studies on the six different flagellins that are incorporated into the flagellar propeller of bdellovibrio <cit> , we found that different flagellin compositions of a single bdellovibrio flagellum are possible, and that in the case of a flic <dig> mutant, for example, an apparently wild type-length flagellum gave a lower swimming speed than wild type  <cit>  suggesting an altered filament rigidity. as flagellar filament growth, in a bacterium with six flagellins, is a post-transcriptionally highly controlled process involving diverse chaperones and gate keepers at the base of the flagellum allowing different subunits to be added into the growing flagellum  <cit>  we cannot expect to tell anything meaningful about these small changes of swimming speed from simple studies of flagellar filament gene expression, so we have decided to leave this aspect of the investigation at this point.

in looking at chaperonin expression regulation by b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> sigma factors, we found that, in contrast to bd <dig>  deletion of which had no effect, the product of gene bd <dig> acts more like the heat shock sigma factor rpoe of other bacteria and represses  the level of expression of chaperonin genes groes <dig> groel  in non-heat shock conditions and the level of expression of the groes <dig>  gene under both heat-shock and non-heat-shock conditions. these data and the finding that the groes <dig> gene is normally expressed in wild type bdellovibrio only during the late stages of predation  when the bdellovibrio are septating and preparing to lyse the exhausted prey bdelloplast, may suggest that a modified chaperonin complex involving groes <dig> is used in bdellovibrio protein expression and folding that occurs at this point. ascertaining why this is the case requires more chaperone-specific experimentation, beyond the scope of this study and mutagenesis of bd <dig> is underway. that the majority of groes residues shown to interact with groel in e. coli <cit>  are conserved or have conserved substitutions in both of the groes <dig> and groes <dig> homologues of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> supports the idea that they form genuine alternative chaperonin complexes, making groel protein folding chambers with different groes “lids”. it is a tantalising possibility that bdellovibrio has a requirement for a modified chaperonin complex for the folding of unusual bdellovibrio proteins required for late-stage prey lysis or bdellovibrio attack phase cell maturation. the bd0743-controlled, late-stage expression of groes <dig> is a possible mechanism for this. although the  bdellovibrio groes <dig> gene product is larger at  <dig> amino-acids than the bd <dig> groes <dig> gene product which is  <dig> amino-acids, there is no significant additional homology  between bdellovibrio groes <dig> and the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> groes-like protein . the bacteriophage t <dig> gp <dig> groes-like protein allows formation of a larger protein folding chamber for unusual phage capsid protein gp <dig> to fold. bdellovibrio, being a bacterium rather than a phage, does not have any homologues of this protein, so any analogous alternative role for groes <dig> in bdellovibrio protein folding awaits the outcomes of further mutagenesis studies.
