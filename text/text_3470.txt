BACKGROUND
the factors that determine the range and distribution patterns of a species along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients have gained significant interest with the recognition that global warming has the potential to cause shifts in these patterns and change interactions among species  <cit> . the range and distribution pattern of a species can be limited by geographical barriers, interactions with other species, or failure to adapt at range margins because of lack of genetic variation, dispersal load, or stochastic extinction  <cit> . when the distribution patterns of two or more closely related species overlap, these species may hybridize and produce hybrid zones, which can affect species distribution  <cit> . the consequences of hybridization on the distribution patterns depend on various environmental and genetic factors, including environmental selection, dispersal ability, asymmetric hybridization, and fitness of hybrid offspring  <cit> . it is important to consider how these factors affect the range and distribution patterns of species under the effect of frequent hybridization.

members of the subgenus hyalodaphnia inhabit freshwater lakes and ponds over a wide range of holarctic regions. hybridization between species of hyalodaphnia with overlapping ranges has been observed in many dispersed locations  <cit> . daphnia galeata, a species of hyalodaphnia, has a wide holarctic distribution  <cit> , which overlaps with that of all the other members of hyalodaphnia, except daphnia umbra  <cit> . in these overlapping areas, local hybrids involving d. galeata are common and often more abundant in lakes than the parental taxa  <cit> . daphnia dentifera, a vicariant taxon of daphnia longispina sensu petrusek et al.  <cit> , also has a wide distribution in north america and japan  <cit> , and hybridizes with d. galeata in north america  <cit>  . nuclear loci of d. dentifera were introduced into most north american populations of d. galeata  <cit> .

there are several morphological differences between d. galeata and d. dentifera, including a dark ring on the base of the distal segment of the swimming setae present in d. dentifera and variations in the number of post-abdominal claws  <cit> . the differences in phenotypic adaptations as an antipredator defense are conspicuous. since carnivorous invertebrates  and gape-limited young-of-the-year  fish selectively prey upon daphniids with a smaller body size, individuals with a larger body size or with other defensive attributes are less vulnerable to these predators. in response to chemical cues from these predators, d. galeata often elongates its head shape and forms a crest  <cit> , whereas juveniles and male d. dentifera occasionally develop neck teeth on the dorsal margin of the helmet  <cit> . both defensive traits of the crest and neck teeth are beneficial against these gape-limited predators  <cit> . however, planktivorous fish, with the exception of gape-limited fish, selectively prey upon daphniids with a larger body size  <cit> . gelinas et al.  <cit>  noted that the number of d. galeata possessing a crest increased during and after the season when yoy fish occurred, indicating that the head morphology of d. galeata is influenced at least in some ways by the presence of planktivorous fish in these habitats. d. galeata and d. dentifera are also ecologically distinct in the range of vertical habitat use within lakes and habitat distribution among lakes of different sizes  <cit> . because these two species and their hybrids exhibit a stable co-existence in many lakes in north america, ecological specialization may reinforce the divergence within these two species  <cit> .

recent phylogeographical studies indicated that d. galeata and d. dentifera should have a longer history of coexistence in japan than in north america  <cit> . during the last ice age, an ice sheet covered the northern regions of north america  <cit> . ishida and taylor  <cit>  estimated that d. galeata and d. dentifera should have expanded their ranges throughout north america after the last deglaciation. on the other hand, japan was mostly unglaciated and unoccupied by permafrost during the last ice age  <cit> . japan should have functioned as a glacial refugium for temperate freshwater invertebrates during several glacial cycles. indeed, one of the oldest mitochondrial clades of d. galeata was distributed only throughout japan. japanese populations of d. dentifera also have much a higher genetic diversity and a stronger regional structure than north american populations, indicating that japan has provided mature habitats for the species. consistently, recent phylogeographical studies have also indicated that japan should be rich in regional population structures and endemic cryptic species of freshwater invertebrates  <cit> .

a survey of the distribution, morphological variation, and hybridization of d. galeata and d. dentifera in japan would provide an opportunity to test important hypotheses regarding hybridization and morphological evolution. these two species can be taxonomically distinguished by certain morphological characteristics in both japan and north america. however, since in japan the two species experienced different climate histories than they did in north america, and since they have a longer history of coexistence there, we hypothesised that this longer coexistence of the two species would lead to extensive genetic admixture, whereas differences in morphological traits related to ecological specialization such as an antipredation defense would be maintained. in addition, it is important to examine the environmental factors that affect the distribution and maintenance of morphological traits that characterize d. galeata and d. dentifera since this would help to predict the distribution and biodiversity of daphnia species under current and future environmental changes such as global warming.

the purpose of this study is to test our hypothesis regarding the consequences of the hybridization between d. galeata and d. dentifera in japan. we used  <dig> populations of d. galeata and d. dentifera distributed throughout japan, and analyzed the relationships among geographic distribution patterns, morphological traits of head shape and body size, and genetic characteristics of mitochondrial 12srrna and nuclear rrna internal transcribed spacers . in particular, we examined  to what degree the morphological traits and the mitochondrial and nuclear characteristics are correlated, how these traits and characteristics are distributed in japan; and  to what degree introgression occurred between these species.

RESULTS
relationship among mitochondrial genealogy, morphology, and geographic distributions
the mitochondrial 12srrna phylogeny revealed that japanese populations consisted of three major clades: d. galeata, d. dentifera, and new species lineages . the 12srrna alignment  was composed of  <dig> unique haplotypes from  <dig> japanese populations with  <dig> sequences deposited in genbank . seven indels were observed at the sites  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the new species lineages were found in three populations: nig <dig>  ngn <dig>  and iwt <dig> .
. the four numbers on each branch indicate greater than 50% bootstrap support values for the branch as determined by nj, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, and a bayesian clade credibility value of greater than 70% asterisks indicate values with less than 50% bootstrap support values, less than 70% bayesian support values, or no support. population names are abbreviated . haplotype a in the d. galeata clade occurred in nine populations throughout japan: hrs <dig>  hyg <dig> mie <dig>  ibr <dig>  ngn <dig>  fsm <dig>  fsm <dig>  ygt <dig>  myg <dig>  myg <dig>  and hkd <dig> 

differences in head morphology were observed between specimens with d. galeata mtdna and those with d. dentifera mtdna. while head morphology of specimens with d. galeata mtdna was various, that of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna was characterized as smaller and more ventrally located crest . linear discriminant analysis was conducted using three morphological variables: relative length of crest , relative position of crest , and body size  . because misclassification probability was lower when using only cl <dig> and cl <dig>  bl was not used in this analysis. scores of linear discriminators  of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna classified these specimens without error, whereas  <dig> % of specimens with d. galeata mtdna were misallocated as those with d. dentifera mtdna  . these misallocated specimens with d. galeata mtdna were found, irrespective of latitude and altitude.

we identified a significant positive correlation between cl <dig> and cl <dig> of both groups of specimens , and a significant negative correlation between bl and cl <dig> of specimens with d. galeata mtdna  .

differences in geographical distribution were also observed between the two groups of specimens . specimens with d. galeata mtdna were distributed at lower latitudes and altitudes, whereas those with d. dentifera mtdna were predominately distributed at higher latitudes and altitudes . fish were present at  <dig> collecting sites where specimens with d. galeata mtdna occurred, and  <dig> sites where specimens with d. dentifera mtdna occurred, whereas fish were absent in only one site  where specimens with d. galeata mtdna occurred and  <dig> sites where specimens with d. dentifera mtdna occurred. groups with both mtdna types coexisted in two lakes: hkd <dig> and ygt <dig>  the results of model selection using glm showed that the presence of specimens with d. galeata mtdna at the collecting site was best explained by the  <dig> parameters of latitude , altitude , and fish presence  , and that the presence of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna was also best explained by latitude , altitude , and fish absence  . in the cases of both mtdna types, if we used only one variable , Δaic  values were larger than  <dig>  thus, it can be reasonably concluded that latitude, altitude, and the presence or absence of fishes affects the distribution of d. galeata and d. dentifera mtdna types.

effects of environmental factors on species morphology and distribution
manova tests were performed with identification of mtdna type  based on 12srrna phylogeny and morphological traits of bl, cl <dig>  and cl <dig> as the dependent variables, and latitude, altitude, and the presence or absence of fish as the independent variables. the results indicated that the latitude and the presence or absence of fish affected morphology  and mtdna types . among the four dependent variables, cl <dig>  cl <dig> and mtdna types were affected by fish and latitude, and bl was affected only by fish .

nuclear its- <dig> phylogeny
nuclear its- <dig> phylogeny revealed that the japanese populations of d. galeata and d. dentifera consisted of two clades: the d. galeata clade and the d. dentifera clade . this phylogeny is consistent with the nuclear phylogeny of its- <dig> and its- <dig> of taylor et al.  <cit> . since its- <dig> and its- <dig> have a close physical linkage, both phylogenies are expected to reflect the same evolutionary histories. the its- <dig> alignment  consisted of  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> populations possessing d. galeata mtdna,  <dig> unique sequences from  <dig> populations possessing d. dentifera mtdna, and  <dig> sequences of d. galeata and d. dentifera deposited in genbank . a sequence of an individual obtained from hkd <dig> was found to have a  <dig> bp repeat fragment from position  <dig> to  <dig>  we removed this repeated fragment for the alignment. an obvious difference between the clades of d. galeata and d. dentifera was found in a segment between positions  <dig> and  <dig> 

recombination test supported the breakpoint at position  <dig>  we compared a phylogeny based on positions  <dig> to  <dig> with one based on positions  <dig> to  <dig>  a sequence of an individual obtained from amr <dig> was found in lineage g <dig>  based on positions  <dig> to  <dig>  but matched the d. dentifera clade in the phylogeny based on positions  <dig> to  <dig>  indicating a recombination event between the d. dentifera clade and lineage g <dig>  none of the other sequences was found to be recombinant.

the d. galeata clade consisted of three lineages: g <dig>  g <dig>  and g <dig>  lineage g <dig> consisted of european d. galeata and japanese specimens with d. galeata mtdna. lineage g <dig> consisted of alaskan d. galeata. lineage g <dig> consisted of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna in hokkaido island and aomori prefecture, which are the northernmost areas of japan.

the phylogenetic relationship within the d. dentifera clade was not well characterized by bootstrap tests and clade credibility values, with the exception of lineage d <dig>  alleles d <dig>  d <dig>  and d <dig> were shared between specimens with d. galeata mtdna and those with d. dentifera mtdna. linage d <dig> consisted of north american d. dentifera and d. galeata and specimens with d. galeata mtdna in tcg <dig>  all specimens possessing d. galeata mtdna had alleles of the d. dentifera clade, except for those of lineage g <dig> , while all specimens possessing d. dentifera mtdna had alleles of the d. dentifera clade or lineage g <dig> 

nuclear its- <dig> rflp and phylogeny
five major rflp patterns  were found in the collected specimens of d. galeata and d. dentifera in japan. in addition, five minor patterns were found in specimens with d. galeata mtdna in hyg <dig>  fsm <dig>  and myg <dig>  and specimens with d. dentifera mtdna in amr <dig> and ngn <dig> .

we reconstructed its- <dig> phylogeny based on sequence data of the major rflp patterns from the collected specimens in japan with sequence data of north american and european specimens deposited in genbank . the alignment  consisted of  <dig> sequences from  <dig> populations possessing d. galeata mtdna,  <dig> sequences from  <dig> populations possessing d. dentifera mtdna, and  <dig> genbank sequences. sequences of rflp pattern b consisted of two clades: one clade included d. galeata  and specimens with d. dentifera mtdna in ygt <dig> and ygt28; the other clade consisted of only japanese specimens with d. galeata mtdna. consistent with the assumption of taylor et al.  <cit> , alleles of rflp pattern b should be indicative of those derived from d. galeata except for the case of ygt <dig> and ygt <dig>  sequences of rflp patterns c <dig> and c <dig> formed polyphyletic clades. although sequences of rflp pattern c <dig> formed two divergent clades, both of the clades consisted of only specimens with d. dentifera mtdna, indicating that alleles of rflp pattern c <dig> should be indicative of those derived from d. dentifera, again consistent with the assumption of taylor et al. .

allele frequency of rflp pattern c <dig> was high in both groups of specimens in japan, while those of rflp patterns b and c <dig> were quite different between the two groups: specimens with d. galeata mtdna ; specimens with d. dentifera mtdna . specimens with alleles of rflp patterns c <dig> and c <dig> were broadly distributed, irrespective of the latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in japan.

discussion
phylogenetic differences in mitochondrial 12srrna sequences corresponded, for the most part, with the morphological differences in head shape. specimens with d. dentifera mtdna exhibited less morphological variation, and had either no crest or a smaller more ventrally located crest, suggesting that individuals with d. dentifera mtdna would retain the typical head morphology of d. dentifera. on the other hand, specimens with d. galeata mtdna exhibited considerably more variation. whereas most specimens with d. galeata mtdna had longer and more dorsally located crests, some were indistinguishable from d. dentifera due to a less developed crest. the differences in mtdna also corresponded to distributional differences; specimens with d. galeata mtdna were mostly distributed at lower latitudes and altitudes, while specimens with d. dentifera mtdna were mostly distributed at higher latitudes and altitudes . the mitochondrial dichotomy between the two daphnia species corresponded well with morphological and distributional differences in japan.

morphological traits and geographical distribution patterns were related to the presence or absence of fish, and to latitude. specimens with d. dentifera mtdna, or specimens with no crest or with smaller crests, were distributed in lakes and ponds without fish predators, or located at higher latitudes. in contrast, specimens with d. galeata mtdna, or specimens with longer and more dorsally located crests, were distributed in lakes and ponds containing fish predators, or located at lower latitudes. although individuals with larger body size tended to be distributed in lakes and ponds without fish predators, the effect of the presence of fish on head shape was larger than the effect on body size. habitats located at higher altitudes tend to have fewer fish due to the limited dispersal ability of fish species. they also tend to be lower in temperature, thus regulating the feeding types and activities of predators. because the differences in defensive strategies between d. dentifera and d. galeata can promote morphological differentiation in head shape, body size, and ecological differentiation in different habitat types  <cit> , the differences in predation pressures may relate to the parapatric distribution of d. galeata and d. dentifera into latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in japan. since the presence of fish can be an important factor in determining the distributions of the two species, the introduction of fish might diminish the occurrence and diversity of d. dentifera in lakes and ponds, particularly those located at higher latitudes. global warming would also be predicted to reduce the distribution ranges of organisms inhabiting lakes and ponds at higher altitudes, such as d. dentifera in japan.

the discordance between mtdna and nuclear its- <dig> phylogenies is indicative of interspecific introgression and hybridization between the two species. specimens with d. galeata mtdna in tcg <dig> were found unexpectedly in lineage d <dig> of the d. dentifera its- <dig> clade, which consisted of the alleles of north american d. dentifera and d. galeata, except for the alleles of tcg <dig> , indicating that the alleles of lineage d <dig> may have recently been introduced from north american populations into tcg <dig>  likewise, ishida & taylor  <cit>  argued that a mitochondrial haplotype of d. galeata in tcg <dig> may have been introduced from north america along with the introduction of certain species of fish, such as oncorhynchus mykiss and salvelinus namaycush, which were introduced into tcg <dig> in  <dig> for commercial and game fishing. lineage g <dig> of the d. galeata its- <dig> clade consisted of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna in the northernmost areas of japan, and was more diverse than lineages g <dig> and g <dig>  indicating incomplete lineage sorting or introgression of common ancestral alleles of lineage g <dig> from d. galeata into d. dentifera in the distant past. since all analyzed specimens with d. dentifera mtdna had its- <dig> alleles of the d. dentifera clade or lineage g <dig>  we had no clear evidence for introgression from d. galeata into d. dentifera in japan. this is consistent with the smaller amount of variation in head morphology of specimens with d. dentifera mtdna. on the other hand, a discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear phylogeny was frequently observed for specimens with d. galeata mtdna . the same pattern was observed between these two species in north america  <cit> .

nuclear its- <dig> phylogeny also suggested interspecific introgression between the two species. a clade of the alleles of rflp pattern b  consisted of d. galeata  and specimens with d. dentifera mtdna in two neighbouring ponds of ygt <dig> and ygt <dig>  which are c.  <dig> meters distant. although the population of ygt <dig> possessed only d. dentifera mtdna, the population of ygt <dig> possessed both mtdna types of d. galeata and d. dentifera, suggesting that hybridization or introgression between the species should occur within the specific region around ygt <dig> and ygt <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we tested a hypothesis that the long history of coexistence between d. galeata and d. dentifera in japan has led to extensive genetic admixture in both nuclear and mitochondrial dna, despite the fact that differences in the morphological traits related to environmental factors, such as predation pressure, have been maintained. in the present study, the correspondence observed among morphology, distribution, and mitochondrial and nuclear dna types for the specimens with d. dentifera mtdna suggests that the species distinction has been maintained for d. dentifera. however, discordance between mtdna and nuclear its- <dig> types was observed for most specimens with d. galeata mtdna, consistent with the pattern found in north america. this suggests nuclear introgression from d. dentifera into d. galeata without mitochondrial introgression. the results indicate that variations in environmental factors, such as predation pressure and temperature, have maintained the separation of distributional ranges and morphological differences, such as head shape, between the two species. however, we cannot rule out other factors, and further studies are needed to verify the hypothesis that selective pressure has maintained the morphological differences between the two species. we were unable to estimate the frequency of the introgression, and we were thus unable to conclude that the long history of coexistence between d. galeata and d. dentifera in japan has caused more frequent introgression between the two species than the frequency observed in the same species in north america. however, even though climatic and geographical conditions have differed greatly between north america and japan, particularly during the ice ages, differences in the morphological traits related to environmental factors, such as predation pressure, have been maintained in both regions. the pattern of introgression was also consistent between the two regions. since the present study indicated that the presence of fish can be an important factor in determining the distributions of the two species, fish introduction can also diminish the occurrence and diversity of d. dentifera in lakes and ponds, particularly those located at higher latitudes. global warming would also be likely to reduce the distribution ranges of organisms inhabiting lakes and ponds at high altitude, such as d. dentifera in japan,
