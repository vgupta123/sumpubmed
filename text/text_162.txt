BACKGROUND
oxygen is a key regulator of the switch between the two different worlds, photosynthetic growth and anaerobic life, of c. reinhardtii. the green alga has an outstanding ability to adapt its metabolism to oxygen availability  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, c. reinhardtii wild type cultures exhibit a four to seven fold higher photosynthesis than respiration rate. anabolic reactions like carbon dioxide fixation and protein biosynthesis predominate during net oxygen production. photolytically evolved oxygen is also used for respiration providing the metabolism with a further source of atp besides photophosphorylation. hydrogen production does not take place, since the hydrogenase genes are not expressed under aerobic conditions  <cit>  and the oxygen-sensitive -hydrogenases would be inhibited by photosynthetically evolved oxygen  <cit> .

under laboratory conditions, anoxia can be established by flushing cultures with argon or by incubating sealed algal cells in the dark. as soon as any dissolved oxygen is removed, fermentative reactions are activated in order to maintain the nad/nadh balance and atp supply  <cit> . under such conditions, the -hydrogenase gene expression is triggered  <cit> . when anaerobically adapted algal cultures are shifted to sudden illumination, a short term hydrogen production can be observed  <cit> . the -hydrogenase hyda <dig> transiently accepts electrons from photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin petf. this phenomenon can be measured as a short hydrogen production flash. soon, oxygen production by psii inhibits the hydrogenase, and photosynthetically generated electrons are consumed in the re-activated calvin-benson cycle  <cit> .

the antagonism between oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygen-sensitive hydrogen production can be circumvented by exposing algal cells to nutritional stress. long term hydrogen production in the light is established when c. reinhardtii cultures are transferred to sulfur-depleted medium  <cit> . the absence of sulfur leads to decline of photosynthetic activity with photosystem ii  being the primary target. the oxygen production rate drops below the respiration rate after one or two days of sulfur deprivation and the algal culture becomes microaerobic/anaerobic. then, -hydrogenase genes are expressed and residual h2o photolytic activity acts as one important electron source for hydrogen production  <cit> . under such conditions of nutritional and anaerobic stress, the release of h <dig> permits low levels of photophosphorylation and thus the continuous generation of atp  <cit> . this energy source  ensures survival of the cells for a prolonged period of time under the above-mentioned adverse conditions. beside the residual psii activity, endogenous starch metabolism plays a significant role as electron source for hydrogen formation  <cit> . in the aerobic phase of sulfur deprivation, cells accumulate up to 8-fold more starch than under normal growth conditions  <cit> . when the photosynthesis/respiration ratio  drops below a ratio of one and anaerobic conditions are established, fermentative pathways are induced including starch degradation. the reduction of the plastoquinone pool is driven by a nadh plastoquinone-oxidoreductase  which oxidizes reducing equivalents originating from starch and protein degradation  <cit> . as a consequence, the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane is maintained and photophosphorylation can still occur, although psii activity is low.

this work describes an alternative approach for the induction of hydrogen metabolism with mutants attenuated in their photosynthesis/respiration capacity ratio  <cit> . by attenuating the p/r ratio to a level lower than one, the culture becomes anaerobic in the light. attenuated p/r ratio mutants  are expected to mimic the physiological status of sulfur-deprived cells. however, these mutants allow the analysis of endogenous substrate pathways and the expression of hydrogen metabolism associated genes under steady state growth conditions without the background of nutritional stress. furthermore, such strains could constitute a basis for continuous hydrogen generation in biotechnological approaches.

this study presents the physiological analysis of attenuated p/r ratio strains , which were identified with a novel screening protocol comprising a high-throughput application of the winkler test. it is demonstrated that one of the isolated mutant strains, apr <dig>  induces a hydrogen metabolism under normal nutrient growth conditions in the light. after calvin-benson cycle inactivation, hydrogen production rates of the apr <dig> strain were twice as high as those reported for the sulfur-depleted wild type.

RESULTS
mutant strain library construction
the mutant library was generated by dna insertional mutagenesis in two different approaches. in the first approach, a cell wall-less, arginine auxotrophic strain  was used as recipient strain and was transformed with the hindiii-linearized pjd <dig> plasmid carrying the intact arg <dig> gene  <cit> . in the second approach, the wild type strain cc- <dig> was employed as background strain and transformed with a paromomycine resistance cassette derived from plasmid psl <dig>  <cit> . about  <dig> mutants from the cc- <dig> and about  <dig> mutants from the cc- <dig> background strain were generated and subjected to the below-mentioned screening procedure.

winkler test screen and its validation
a common screening protocol to isolate c. reinhardtii mutants with impaired photosynthesis entails the detection of acetate requirement, thus the isolation of mutants which are not able to grow photoautotrophically  <cit> . this type of screening, which selects for mutants with severe defects in the photosynthetic metabolism, was not applicable for our approach, since we aimed to analyze steady state hydrogen production, and a significant hydrogen generation by c. reinhardtii depends on photosynthetic activity  <cit> . thus, we did not screen for mutant strains with drastic defects of photosynthesis, but our screening procedure had to differentiate between oxygen-producing transformants and transformants which become anaerobic in the light. therefore, the winkler test, which determines water-dissolved oxygen concentrations in four chemical reactions , was applied  <cit> . in principle, dissolved oxygen is fixed in a redox reaction with manganese chloride. after an acidification step, added iodide ions are oxidized to iodine in stoichiometric amounts to dissolved oxygen. the iodine concentration can be measured by titrating with sodium thiosulfate. the molar amount of added sodium thiosulfate is therefore equivalent to dissolved oxygen concentrations. starch solution is supplemented as a visual indicator to simplify the identification of the titration point.

the test comprises four steps in which mncl <dig>  ki/naoh, h3po <dig> and starch solutions are added successively into the test wells. cultures which stay anaerobic can be determined colorimetrically.

it was important that all cells were in the linear or exponential growth phase, because oxygen production rates for the wild type decline in the stationary growth phase. measurements of non-growing cells would result in a high number of false positives. for that reason, each transformant was supplied with fresh tap medium six hours before the test was performed to ensure oxygen production of transformants with normal p/r ratios. the first two reaction steps were carried out under anaerobic conditions to prevent diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the samples. for sufficient oxygen production, the plates were incubated in an anaerobic tent or in a nitrogen gas-flushed glove box about half an hour under  <dig> to  <dig> μe × m- <dig> × s- <dig> incident actinic light. the subsequent steps of the winkler test could be performed under aerobic conditions, because the acidification step prevents oxygen fixation by manganese chloride, the latter occurring only under basic conditions.

the winkler test validation for small sample volumes  and its feasibility with high cell densities of algal cells were tested using the wild types cc- <dig> and cc- <dig> as positive controls and the rubisco large subunit-deficient strain cc- <dig> as a negative control. cc- <dig>  which produces less oxygen than it consumes, did not turn blue after the winkler test, whereas the wild type needed to be titrated with sodium thiosulfate to reach the titration point . these results indicated that the winkler test method is an appropriate way to select mutants with attenuated p/r ratios because it can discriminate between oxygen-evolving  strains and oxygen-consuming mutants in which the p/r is <  <dig> 

screening results and selection for hydrogen production strains under normal growth conditions
the two mutant libraries comprising about  <dig> transformants were screened with the winkler test. out of those, three transformants , which did not turn blue, and one transformant , which needed less na2s2o <dig> than the wild type to reach the titration point, were selected for further physiological and biochemical studies . apr <dig> was found in the cc-425/hindiii-pjd <dig> mutant library, whereas apr <dig>  apr <dig> and apr <dig> derived from the cc- <dig> background strain transformed with the paromomycine resistance cassette.

the light saturation curve of photosynthesis for each of the four mutant strains was recorded at the end of their exponential growth phase giving information about maximal oxygen production rates, respiration rates, and the compensation point . additionally, the maximal quantum yield of psii was calculated from fluorescence induction measurements for each mutant strain . in order to elucidate physiological defects of the mutants, western blot analyses with antibodies against the d <dig> core protein of psii, the chloroplastic atpase α-subunit, and the rubisco large subunit rbcl were carried out .

the compensation point reflects the light intensity at which the cultures produce as much oxygen as they consume. exposing sealed cultures to lower light intensities than at the compensation point lead to anaerobiosis. values represent means ± standard deviation .

apr <dig> showed a higher respiration rate  and a lowered net oxygen production rate  compared to the wild type cc- <dig>  calculating the ratio of the photosynthesis rate  to the respiration rate resulted in a p/r ratio of  <dig>  at saturating light intensities . the compensation point of apr <dig> was reached at a light intensity of  <dig>  μe × m- <dig> × s- <dig> which was higher than the respective light intensity for the wild type . however, the maximal psii quantum yields  and protein levels examined by western blot analyses did not differ significantly from the wild type .

mutant strain apr <dig> is light-sensitive, so that cells were always grown under dim light for the physiological and biochemical analyses. apr <dig> displayed slightly lowered psii maximal quantum yields than the wild type  but exhibited almost no photosynthetic oxygen evolution at all applied light intensities. western blot analyses showed that strain apr <dig> misses the chloroplastic atpase α subunit .

permanently low oxygen production rates could also be measured in the c. reinhardtii transformant apr <dig>  no functional psii systems could be assumed from fluorescence measurements, and western blot analyses showed that the psii core protein d <dig> was missing . presumably, residual active psii systems are still present in apr <dig> which are responsible for the low photolytic activity that could be detected from oxygen production measurements .

c. reinhardtii strain apr <dig> showed the highest photosynthetic oxygen-evolving activity of all screened strains , although the psii quantum yield was lowered by half  and d <dig> levels were also reduced . respiration rates were comparable to the control, and the compensation point was already reached at a light intensity of  <dig> μe × m- <dig> × s- <dig> which was comparable to the value measured in wild type cells.

our aim was to analyze the hydrogen production routes during photosynthetic electron transport under steady state conditions. thus, c. reinhardtii strain apr <dig> was selected for the studies on photosynthetic hydrogen metabolism. apr <dig> established anaerobiosis under moderate light conditions  without being severely affected in photosynthetic electron transport as indicated by the above-mentioned experiments and the fact that it could grow photoautotrophically .

apr <dig> induces -hydrogenase synthesis under moderate light intensity and normal growth conditions, but does not evolve significant amounts of hydrogen
to examine the hydrogen metabolism of c. reinhardtii transformant apr <dig>  cells were inoculated in sealed culture bottles in tap medium and incubated under light intensities which were adjusted to be slightly lower than those determined to reach the compensation point. -hydrogenase enzyme activity was measured by in vitro activity assays, which detect active hydrogenase enzymes in whole-cell extracts supplied with reduced methylviologene as artificial electron donor for the -hydrogenases under oxygen-free conditions. the use of an artificial electron donor allows the detection of any active hydrogenase enzyme within the cells, independent from the physiological electron supply to the hydrogenase which usually limits net hydrogen production.

apr <dig> in vitro -hydrogenase activity could be detected after the second day of growth under the above-mentioned conditions and rose to its maximal level after five days . hence, sealed apr <dig> cultures established anaerobiosis without any external manipulation and synthesized -hydrogenases in parallel to cell proliferation.

however, despite high in vitro hydrogenase activities, no in vivo hydrogen production rates were detectable over the culture period. only traces of hydrogen in the headspace of sealed apr <dig> could be measured by gas chromatography . this observation indicated that the electron supply to the hydrogenase was limited.

calvin-benson cycle inactivation in apr <dig> by glycolaldehyde 
ga disrupts calvin-benson cycle activity by inhibiting the phosphoribulokinase which catalyses the atp-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose-5-phosphate to ribulose- <dig> -bisphosphate. in former studies, ga was employed for the examination of carbon dioxide transport without concomitant carbon dioxide fixation, or for investigating the dependence of the psii repair system on the activity of the calvin-benson cycle  <cit> .

c. reinhardtii mutant strain apr <dig> becomes anaerobic under photoheterotrophic, sulfur-replete conditions and triggers -hydrogenase synthesis in the light as shown by in vitro activity assays . in order to analyze the influence of calvin-benson cycle activity on hydrogen metabolism under -hydrogenase-activated conditions, in vivo hydrogen production rates in cultures of apr <dig> were determined depending on ga treatment . as controls, the sulfur-deprived wild type and the rubisco-deficient strain cc- <dig> in full medium were treated with ga. similar to apr <dig>  cc- <dig> can establish anaerobiosis and induces -hydrogenase synthesis under sulfur-replete conditions. however, this strain cannot fix carbon dioxide  <cit> , which is in contrast to strain apr <dig>  upon ga addition, the in vivo hydrogen production rate of -hydrogenase-activated apr <dig> cell samples rose from  <dig> to  <dig> nmol × h <dig> × h- <dig> × μg chl- <dig> and was thus double as high as the rate determined in sulfur-deprived wild type cells. calvin-benson cycle inhibition in sulfur-deprived wild type and cc- <dig> cell samples did not result in a significant increase of hydrogen production capacity .

hydrogen accumulation of ga-treated, -hydrogenase-activated apr <dig> cultures lasted six hours under  <dig> to  <dig> μe × m- <dig> × s- <dig> incident actinic light exposure, and the hydrogen concentration rose from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μmol h <dig> × ml- <dig> . hydrogen production obviously stopped, because the amount of active hydrogenase enzymes, as determined by in vitro activity assays, declined steadily in the first four hours and ceased after six hours . photosynthesis and respiration rates were strongly lowered by the presence of ga as well .

hydrogen concentrations in the headspaces of the cc- <dig> control and ga-treated cc- <dig> cultures did not differ significantly over the measuring period . both cultures accumulated hydrogen almost to the same degree during eight hours. similar to apr <dig>  the in vitro hydrogenase activity of ga-treated cc- <dig> cultures decreased and was undetectable after eight hours .

discussion
a novel screening system for the identification of photosynthetic microorganisms that are altered in their photosynthesis-respiration balance was designed
one aim of this work was to establish an alternative approach for the induction of hydrogen metabolism in c. reinhardtii, so as to be able to achieve photosynthetic electron transport to the hydrogenase under steady state growth conditions. for this purpose, a selective screening system for mutants attenuated in their photosynthesis/respiration capacity ratio was established.

the screening system, which is based on the so-called winkler test to measure dissolved oxygen concentrations, indeed captured a new class of mutant strains that can survive under photoautotrophic conditions  but are attenuated in their p/r capacity ratio. this is particularly the case for the c. reinhardtii mutant strains apr <dig> and apr <dig> 

however, in addition to reaching our actual goal, we found that the screening procedure allows the identification of a broad phenotypic spectrum of mutant strains. besides the two mutants with attenuated p/r ratios, two acetate-requiring mutants were identified confirming the robustness of the screening procedure. thus, the iodometric determination of dissolved oxygen concentrations is a cheap and fast method which can be employed universally for screenings of oxygenic microorganisms that are altered in their photosynthesis to respiration ratio and their photosynthetic activity, respectively. another advantage of the method is that environmental conditions can be modified for the design of more selective screening protocols. for example, exposing the plates of a transformant library to high light would allow the finding of mutants with an imbalanced rate of psii synthesis to psii repair rate, whereas lower light intensities would result in screening of mutants with pronounced respiration rates.

from all screened mutants, apr <dig> was the most suitable to examine hydrogen production under normal growth conditions. strains apr <dig> and apr <dig> are characterized by a p/r ratio lower than one and could thereby establish anaerobiosis under all light intensities . however, charge separation and linear electron transport were drastically altered in apr <dig> and apr <dig> . in strain apr <dig>  psii was significantly affected, prohibiting the measurement of psii-driven electron transport to the -hydrogenase. strain apr <dig> misses a subunit of the plastidic atp-synthase. studies with atpase deficient c. reinhardtii mutants which are not capable to assemble the thylakoid membrane localized coupling factor cf <dig> showed a progressive loss of psii cores after several hours of medium light exposure  <cit> . similar results could be obtained with the light-sensitive apr <dig>  after apr <dig> had been exposed to medium light conditions, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements and immunodetection of d <dig> indicated a degradation of psii cores as well . thus, in strain apr <dig>  linear photosynthetic electron transport is strongly affected, both because of damaged psii centres and an altered proton gradient.

since hydrogen production is dependent on photosynthetically reduced ferredoxin, these non-photoautotrophic strains were not appropriate to analyze the hydrogen metabolism under normal growth conditions. nevertheless, apr <dig> and apr <dig> are eligible candidates for the research field studying the regulation of psii or atpase subunit synthesis, assembly, or repair.

reductants are primarily directed to assimilative pathways in -hydrogenase-activated apr <dig> cultures
in the following studies we concentrated on c. reinhardtii mutant strain apr <dig>  whose attenuated p/r ratio could be used to induce -hydrogenase synthesis by adjusting the light to moderate intensities as expected. however, apr <dig> did not produce significant amounts of hydrogen during the -hydrogenase-active phase .

presumably, most of the photo-reduced ferredoxin is employed for assimilative pathways and nadph generation, but not for hydrogen production under normal growth conditions, which is also indicated by the fact, that apr <dig> was still able to proliferate under our experimental conditions.

the ratio of reduced to oxidized ferredoxin displays a key junction between photosynthesis and anabolic pathways like sulfur/nitrogen/carbon assimilation or amino acid synthesis  <cit> . one major recipient of cellular reductants under normal growth condition is the ferredoxin-nadp+ reductase which supplies the calvin-benson cycle with nadph. enzyme kinetic studies provided data about michaelis-menten constants  of the c. reinhardtii -hydrogenase for spinach ferredoxin  and of the c. reinhardtii fnr for ferredoxin coupled to cytochrome c reduction   <cit> . obviously, even if active -hydrogenase is synthesized in growing apr <dig> cultures, the different michaelis-menten constants of ferredoxin for the -hydrogenase and for fnr result in a clear preference of passing photosynthetic electrons to assimilative pathways rather than to hydrogen evolution.

hydrogen metabolism as a protection system to dissipate excess photon energy in the absence of other electron sinks
we suggested that under normal growth conditions, even in the -hydrogenase-activated apr <dig> cells, photosynthetically provided electrons are utilized for assimilatory processes, carbon dioxide fixation above all.

it has been shown that hydrogen production in anaerobically adapted alga is highest when the carbon dioxide concentrations are lowest and vice versa  <cit> . a recent study showed that the rubisco-deficient strain cc- <dig>  which also has a permanently reduced psii activity, can produce hydrogen in complete medium  <cit> . it was discussed that in this strain the hydrogenase acts as an alternative electron sink in the absence of the calvin-benson cycle. reversely we concluded that inhibition of carbon dioxide fixation would result in a net production of hydrogen in anaerobic apr <dig> cultures. indeed, treatment of c. reinhardtii strain apr <dig> with ga yielded high in vivo hydrogen production rates that were even higher than in the sulfur-deprived c. reinhardtii wild type. on the other hand, the addition of ga to the rubisco-deficient strain cc- <dig> had no significant effect on hydrogen evolution, indicating that ga acts specifically on the activity of the calvin-benson cycle.

however, neither in vitro nor in vivo hydrogenase activity sustained longer than six hours under medium light exposure in the examined cells. no biochemical effect of ga on in vitro activity of purified -hydrogenase could be observed . obviously, ga has a deleterious effect on photosynthesis and an indirect physiological effect on -hydrogenase activity. one explanation is that the efficiency of the "hydrogenase valve" is not efficient enough so that the photosynthetic electron transport chain becomes over-reduced resulting in photoinactivation of psii  <cit> . alternatively, ga, which is also substrate of e.g. ketolases, has another deep impact on the cellular metabolism of c. reinhardtii  <cit> . another explanation could be that the cellular concentration of active -hydrogenase enzymes decreases due to lowered protein biosynthesis rates  <cit> .

still, this study provides additional evidence for the model that hydrogen generation via -hydrogenase is a tool by which c. reinhardtii is able to dispose excess redox power and permits coupled electron transport in the thylakoid and mitochondrial membranes to generate atp albeit only under microaerobic/anaerobic conditions  <cit> . the atp energy helps the cell to survive under these stress conditions, when no co <dig> fixation takes place.

in view of the natural habitats of c. reinhardtii, this strategy makes sense. especially in freshwater ponds and puddles, macronutrients including carbon dioxide as well as light can become limited due to growth of other microorganisms. under these low light conditions, photosynthetic activity would probably become low enough to allow the establishment of microaerobic/anaerobic conditions and the expression of the hydrogenase genes therewith.

CONCLUSIONS
the winkler test screening procedure is a valuable method for the identification of a new class of c. reinhardtii mutants which are characterized by an imbalanced p/r ratio, but which are still able to grow photoautotrophically. these mutants constitute a new platform to induce a hydrogen metabolism in the light under normal growth conditions without nutritional stress. thus, such transformants allow the analysis of a steady state hydrogen metabolism. the results of strain apr <dig> clearly show that this class of strains is suited to get deeper information about the electron sources and sinks involved in hydrogen production. furthermore, c. reinhardtii strains with a lowered p/r capacity ratio are promising to be used in biotechnological approaches as has been suggested by others  <cit> . however, the presented inhibitor studies showed that – besides balancing the p/r ratio in order to establish anaerobic/microaerobic conditions essential for -hydrogenase synthesis – other assimilative pathways have to be down regulated or inactivated for significant in vivo hydrogen production rates under normal growth condition.
