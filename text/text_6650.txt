BACKGROUND
it is widely accepted that up to 90% of the human genome is transcribed into various types of rnas  <cit> . however, only a very small proportion of transcripts  encode proteins. although there is a possibility that many transcripts are simply noise  <cit> , a considerable number of non-protein-coding rnas  are produced  <cit> . the increasing numbers of ncrnas found by systematic genome-wide screening have also demonstrated the widespread existence of ncrnas in nature  <cit> . the ncrnas can be categorized by length as 19~ <dig> nt small ncrnas such as mirnas and pirnas  <cit> ; intermediate-size ncrnas, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> nt, such as the small nucleolar rnas   <cit> ; and long mrna-like ncrnas with sizes larger than  <dig> nt  <cit> .

snornas function mainly as modulators of ribosomal rnas   <cit> , and represent the largest group of functional ncrnas. based on sequence and structural features, snornas can be classified into two families-box c/d snornas and box h/aca snornas-which guide site-specific 2'-o-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation of rrna, respectively  <cit> . the spectrum of snorna targets is continuously growing. some snornas control methylation of trnas  <cit> . small cajal body rnas , a subset of snornas with box c/d and/or box h/aca, regulate post-transcriptional modification of rna polymerase ii-transcribed snrnas  <cit> . recent findings have demonstrated that snorna can also target mrna, to guide alternative splicing  <cit> . another interesting discovery is that snornas may be precursors of micrornas and possess microrna-like functions  <cit> . together, available evidence suggests that snornas may have broader functions than previously appreciated.

the genomic organization of snorna genes displays great diversity in different organisms. unlike yeast and plants, in which snornas are usually transcribed from independent polymerase ii transcription units with dedicated promoters  <cit> , most vertebrate snornas reside in the introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding genes and are generated by splicing-dependent processing  <cit> . intron-encoded snornas may also have special promoters to drive snorna transcription  <cit> . many snorna genes have multiple paralogs derived from one or more duplications  <cit> . in nematodes, the paralogs of intron-encoded snorna genes were likely generated by cis- and trans-duplication mechanisms  <cit> . luo and li demonstrated that most human box h/aca snornas were retrogenes produced by l <dig> integration  <cit> . weber reported that many mammalian snornas were mobile genetic elements designated as snorna/scarna retroposons   <cit> . recently, schmitz and colleagues discovered a platypus-specific snorna retroposon with powerful transposable activity that replicated a single snorna to form about  <dig>  paralogs in the whole genome  <cit> . it is therefore possible that retroposition of snorna genes may have played an important role during evolution of mammalian genomes.

based on these recent findings, it is likely that ncrnas have important functions in almost every aspect of eukaryotic growth regulation. however, only a limited number and classes of ncrnas have been discovered to date. therefore, systematic identification of ncrnas from various organisms is a critical primary step in the provision of a road map for functional studies of ncrnas in various organisms. the rhesus macaque  is the most thoroughly studied primate apart from humans. although phylogenetically separated by more than  <dig> million years of evolution  <cit> , rhesus macaques and humans are closely related and share a common ancestor dating back to about  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . therefore, study of rhesus monkeys assists primate evolutionary research and modern biomedical programs  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  protein-coding genes and  <dig>  non-protein coding genes  have been identified in the rhesus monkey genome by the ensembl genome annotation group  <cit> . although the expression pattern and possible functions of many protein-coding genes have been reported, identification of non-protein-coding genes of the rhesus monkey has relied only on computational predictions, by searching for sequences similar to those of known ncrnas identified in other species. such an approach is obviously inappropriate for identification of novel ncrnas. here, we conducted a systematic experimental identification of rhesus monkey ncrnas by constructing a cdna library derived from rna fragments with sizes of  <dig> to  <dig> nt. we identified  <dig> non-redundant ncrnas, including  <dig> snornas and eight unclassified ncrnas. we found that some of our identified ncrnas were lineage- or species-specific. further analysis of the genomic organization of these ncrnas demonstrated that the majority represented snornas with multiple paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome. detailed analysis of the flanking sequences of each of the snorna paralogs revealed that some snornas were retrogenes generated through l1-mediated integration machinery, suggesting that retroposon-mediated trans-duplication may have been a driving force for expansion of novel snornas in the rhesus monkey genome.

RESULTS
systematic identification of rhesus monkey ncrnas by analysis of a cdna library
full-length intermediate-size ncrna-enriched libraries  were constructed using a previously described method  <cit> , with minor modifications. this ensured that the libraries contained a substantial proportion of full-length ncrna clones with defined 5' and 3' termini. the rna used in library construction was extracted from the heart and skeletal muscle tissue of rhesus monkey. in total,  <dig>  clones from two full-length cdna libraries were sequenced. after discarding matches to trnas, rrnas, and mrnas, the remaining  <dig> sequences were considered to be putative ncrnas and analyzed further. by merging redundant sequences and comparing the sequences and secondary structures of such putative ncrnas with known ncrnas annotated in the ensembl and rfam databases, the  <dig> clones were classified into  <dig> ncrnas, including  <dig> snornas  representing  <dig> snorna families,  <dig> snrnas, one 7sk rna, six y rnas, two 7sl rnas , one vault rna, one ribonuclease p rna component h <dig> , one rna component of mitochondrial rna processing endoribonuclease , and eight unclassified ncrna candidates .

all rhesus monkey snornas identified in this study have known human homologs. among  <dig> rhesus snornas,  <dig> show perfect matches with the human homologs, whereas the other twelve rhesus snornas are also highly conserved between monkey and human, with conservation scores over  <dig>  . in addition to showing homology in sequence and/or secondary structure with known human snornas, all of our cloned snornas had the conserved snorna motifs. in the  <dig> c/d box snornas, we identified  <dig> pairs of the c/c' box with the d/d' box . an h box and an aca box were also found in the secondary structures of all h/aca snornas . we further searched the sequences of each rhesus monkey snorna and the human homolog. the data showed that guide sequences and target sites were highly conserved between rhesus monkey and human .

expression patterns of the  <dig> ncrnas in tissues of rhesus monkey and other species
the expression of the  <dig> ncrnas was confirmed by northern blotting . all tested ncrnas were expressed in the six examined tissues of rhesus monkey . several quantitative differences in the expression abundance of ncrnas were observed among different tissues, but no tissue-specific expression pattern could be discerned. we also investigated expression of the  <dig> monkey ncrnas in the skeletal muscle tissue of human, mouse, and chicken, by northern blotting . based on the observed expression patterns, the  <dig> ncrnas could be classified into six groups . group  <dig> ncrnas were expressed in chicken, mouse, human, and all examined rhesus monkey tissues; group  <dig> ncrnas were detected in monkey, human, and mouse, but not in chicken; group  <dig> ncrnas were expressed in monkey and human; and group  <dig> ncrnas were detected only in rhesus monkey tissues. interestingly, snord <dig> was expressed only in mouse and monkey ; snord <dig> was detected in chicken, human, and rhesus monkey, but was absent from the mouse . to rule out the possibility that the lack of detectable signals in northern blotting was caused by tissue-specific expression of lineage/species-specific ncrnas, we investigated the synthesis of these materials in nine human and mouse tissues, but no signals were detected .

conservation analysis of rhesus ncrnas using the blast algorithm, as well as comparison with human, mouse, and chicken genomic sequences, demonstrated that most  lineage/species-specific expression patterns were supported by sequence homology, although expression of some highly conserved sequences was not detected . the expression patterns of ten ncrnas in groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were inconsistent with the conservation scores of their genomic sequences across different species. for example, eight ncrnas of group  <dig> showed conserved sequences but no detectable expression in human tissues . it is possible that the homologs of these ncrnas are pseudogenes, or are expressed at levels below the threshold of sensitivity of the northern blot. alternatively, the homologs might be transcriptionally regulated in a spatio-temporal fashion, or by physiological or pathological stimuli/stresses, and would thus not be constitutively expressed under normal conditions.

comparative genomic analysis of rhesus monkey snornas
the secondary structures and functional boxes of snornas were found to be highly conserved  <cit> , but the nucleotide sequences outside of the hallmark boxes and the antisense regions of snornas changed during vertebrate evolution. to investigate the sequence conservation of snornas over the course of primate evolution, we plotted the sequences of  <dig> rhesus monkey snorna families against those of eight other primate genomes. as genomic sequences of some species are incomplete, only  <dig> snorna families showed identifiable homologs in all eight primate species examined. sequence alignment data showed that some snornas sequences diverged even among closely related primates. the sequence alignments of the top five divergent snornas are shown in additional file  <dig> 

to determine when rhesus monkey snornas appeared during vertebrate evolution, we searched for homologs of  <dig> rhesus monkey snorna families  in seven other representative vertebrates, based on annotations in ensembl release  <dig> . among the  <dig> rhesus monkey snorna families,  <dig> shared homologs even in zebrafish and medaka , indicating that these snornas appeared early in vertebrate evolution. eight snorna families were detected in reptiles and evolutionarily later species , and  <dig> snorna families appeared after the emergence of birds . the remaining  <dig> snorna families were present in mammals but clearly absent in birds and other non-mammalian species . thirteen of  <dig> mammalian snorna families did not have homologs in the platypus genome , suggesting a later emergence in mammalian evolution. finally, one snorna without a homolog in the mouse may be primate-specific .

snorna expansion during vertebrate evolution
the total number of snorna-encoding genes increased during vertebrate evolution, based on data from the ensembl genome annotation project  <cit> . we asked whether this increment in snorna genes was attributable to the generation of multiple paralogs by duplication mechanisms, or arose de novo by accumulation of nucleotide mutations, or was attributable to the action of other driving mechanisms. of course, these possibilities may be combined. to address this question, we collected all predicted and validated snorna sequences from eight representative vertebrate species represented in the ensembl database, including zebrafish, medaka, frog, chicken, platypus, mouse, rhesus monkey, and human, and calculated the total number of snorna genes as well as the number of snorna families . as shown in figure 4a, the number of snorna families increased during vertebrate evolution, indicating a de novo origin of snorna genes. in addition, the number of intron-encoded snornas rose significantly in birds and thereafter appeared in mammals, contributing extensively to the expansion of snorna families . the total number of snorna-encoded genes increased suddenly in mammals after the divergence from birds. also, the expansion of mammalian snornas usually involved intergenic-encoded snornas, and the principal contribution to expansion was the production of many members of such snorna families . the number of predicted snorna genes in medaka, zebrafish, frog, and birds is less than  <dig>  but the numbers increased to  <dig>  in the platypus,  <dig> in the mouse, and  <dig> in the rhesus monkey genome. as shown in figure 4c, compared to caenorhabditis elegans, in which nearly all snornas exist as single copies , 30~60% of vertebrate snorna families have multiple paralogs, demonstrating that large-scale duplications of particular snorna families may have occurred during vertebrate evolution . among the  <dig> identified rhesus monkey snorna families with annotated orthologs in human and mouse,  <dig> are singletons, and the remaining  <dig> snorna families have  <dig> paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome .

the expansion mode of snornas differed among the species examined. for example, the rhesus monkey, mouse, and platypus genomes each contain no more than three copies of snorau <dig>  but  <dig> copies may be found in the human genome. however, the snora <dig> family has no more than three copies in the rhesus and human genomes, but  <dig> members may be found in the mouse genome.

duplication mechanisms of rhesus monkey snornas
according to ensembl annotations, eight rhesus monkey snorna families are predicted to have more than ten paralogs. as shown in table  <dig>  the majority of high-copy snornas are present in the three examined mammalian species, and most are duplicated in a species-specific fashion. this suggests that most high-copy snornas were replicated in recent evolutionary times, after the speciation of mammals. to explore driving forces for the high duplication rate of snornas in mammalian species, we analyzed the flanking sequences of each paralog within individual snorna families to search for putative transposable elements mediating snorna expansion. we found that the paralogs of snora <dig> in the rhesus monkey and mouse genomes shared a ~ <dig> bp consensus sequence in the 3' flanking regions . to investigate whether a particular transposable element  mediated the duplication of snora <dig> in monkey and mouse genomes, we first searched for known tes in the flanking sequences of snora <dig> using repeatmasker  <cit> . however, no known transposable element was identified in the flanking sequences. a genomic blast search of the consensus sequence did not show a high copy-number in either the rhesus monkey or mouse genome, suggesting that a novel te did not exist in the consensus sequence. thus, the duplication of snora <dig> paralogs most likely occurred via a non-te mediated mechanism. the snora <dig> family includes  <dig> paralogs with apparently random distribution in the rhesus monkey genome. each duplication unit possesses typical sine-like retroposon structural features characterized by a poly end and a target site duplication   <cit> . the 3'-flanking sequences of eleven snora <dig> paralogs of the rhesus monkey are shown in figure 6a. interestingly, six snora <dig> paralogs have multiple poly sequences , suggesting that some rhesus monkey snora <dig> sequences might have undergone several rounds of duplication, to create the variant paralogs .

* the total number of genomic loci for each snorna family is based on ensembl genome annotation data .

two paralogs of rhesus monkey snora <dig> were also examined. one  is located in an intergenic region on chromosome  <dig>  the other  is located on chromosome  <dig> within the intron of nf-kappa-b inhibitor-interacting ras-like protein  <dig> . there is one copy of snora <dig> in the mouse genome. based on syntenic region analysis between mouse and rhesus monkey, snora76a is likely to be the parental copy in the rhesus monkey genome. the snora76b paralog is probably a novel progeny copy that possibly arose after the divergence of rodents and primates. this paralog seems to be rhesus monkey-specific, as snora76b is absent in the syntenic region of the marmoset, orangutan, chimpanzee, and human. the 3'-flanking sequences of snora76b and snora76a share about  <dig>  nt, suggesting that snora76a was translocated together with the 3' flanking sequence, from chromosome  <dig> to chromosome  <dig>  to create the novel snora76b paralog .

sine-like expansion was also observed among some snorna families. the flanking sequences of snora76b contain a terminal poly, a tsd, and t2a <dig> derivatives preferably recognized by the l <dig> nicking endonuclease, all of which are features of sine family transposons. therefore, we hypothesize that snora76b may be a sine-like retrogene generated using the l <dig> integration machinery. figure 7b shows another example of snorna trans-duplication in the rhesus monkey genome. there are six copies of the snora <dig> gene in this genome. one copy of snora <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> is located in the first intron of a gene termed the human snhg <dig> homolog . snora24b on chromosome  <dig> possesses characteristics typical of a sine-like retrogene  and the immediate downstream region of rhesus snora24b is composed of three segments that could be aligned to the 3' region of the first intron, and the entire sequences of exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  of the human snhg <dig> gene, respectively. the genomic composition of the flanking region of rhesus monkey snora24b is evidence that this snorna locus was generated in an rna-mediated retro-transposition event and that the transposed unit originated from a partially processed hnrna of snhg <dig>  as a result, snora <dig> together with the 3' segment of the sngh <dig> transcript and the polya end thereof retroposed to a new locus on chromosome  <dig>  the snor24b locus . apart from these two examples, we also identified another  <dig> potential rhesus monkey snorna retrogenes . in summary, our data suggest that sine-like retroposon-mediated retroposition might represent a driving force for rhesus monkey snorna expansion.

analysis of snorna host genes
a large proportion of vertebrate snornas are encoded in the introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding genes. although snorna host genes with ribosome-translation-related functions were the first to be reported, some snornas are also hosted by non-ribosome or non-translation-related genes. here, we systematically analyzed the functional spectrum of host genes for all intronic snornas predicted in four representative vertebrates , including medaka, frog, chicken, and rhesus monkey. as shown in figure 8a, more than 80% of snorna host genes in medaka are ribosome-related protein-coding genes, whereas this percentage decreases to 30% in the rhesus monkey. similar patterns were evident in the functional distribution of experimentally validated snorna host genes when the chicken and rhesus monkey were compared . the data suggests that snorna-encoding genes expanded in the introns of non-ribosomal and non-translational protein-coding genes during vertebrate evolution.

we also searched for gene orthologs hosting snornas in eight additional species, including c. elegans, fruit fly, medaka, zebrafish, frog, platypus, mouse, and human. interestingly, we found that almost all chicken snornas and host genes thereof had orthologs in humans and the rhesus monkey , suggesting that birds and primates shared not only snornas but also the host genes from a common ancestor dating back more than  <dig> million years ago. a large proportion  of rhesus monkey snorna host genes with ribosome- and translation-related functions have orthologs in the chicken genome, and the chicken orthologs are also hosts of snornas . however, only 37% of the orthologs of non-ribosome and non-translation-related rhesus monkey snorna host genes carried snornas in the chicken genome , indicating that the majority of monkey snornas encoded by introns of non-ribosome-related genes appeared after the divergence of birds and mammals.

discussion
recent studies have demonstrated that the functions of non-protein-coding rnas may encompass almost every aspect of biological activity in normal development and disease biogenesis  <cit> . rhesus macaques are a suitable primate model for basic and applied biomedical research  <cit> . however, in contrast to the considerable literature on human and mouse ncrnas, rhesus monkey ncrnas have not previously been systematically characterized. here, we performed a detailed screening of the rhesus monkey intermediate-size ncrna transcriptome and cloned  <dig> rhesus monkey ncrnas, including  <dig> snornas, eight unclassified ncrnas, and  <dig> known rnas . by comparative genomics analysis, we found several lineage- or species-specific snornas. genomic organization analysis showed that the majority of rhesus monkey snornas have many paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome. by flanking sequence analysis, we found that sine-like retroposon-mediated trans-duplication may have been an important mechanism in expansion of novel snornas in the rhesus monkey genome.

among the  <dig> identified rhesus monkey ncrnas, eight unclassified ncrna candidates could not be assigned to any known class of ncrna. these eight unclassified ncrnas were ubiquitously expressed in the six rhesus monkey tissues tested. recently, we also identified nine unclassified ncrnas from the chicken  <cit> . previous reports also showed that some ncrnas obtained from cdna library sequencing did not belong to any known ncrna family, and these ncrnas were designated as unclassified or unknown  <cit> . hüttenhofer and coworkers found  <dig> such unclassified ncrnas, of length 50~ <dig> nt, in mouse brain cdna libraries  <cit> . deng et al. reported  <dig> unclassified ncrnas of length 70~ <dig> nt in a c. elegans cdna library  <cit> . yuan identified  <dig> unclassified ncrnas by constructing cdna libraries from four developmental stages of drosophila melanogaster  <cit> . these unclassified ncrnas often show little sequence conservation and are less prevalent compared to known snornas. however, these observations do not mean that the unclassified ncrnas are non-functional  <cit> . the increasing number of newly identified unclassified ncrnas suggests that other types/classes of ncrna of intermediate size  remain to be identified, and novel ncrna families will likely be susceptible to classification using enhanced bioinformatic comparisons and extensive functional studies of the roles played by such ncrnas.

previous reports showed that the majority of known snornas were conserved between human and mouse, at a level of 80~90%  <cit> . most rhesus monkey snornas identified in the present study show high homology to those of the human and mouse. however,  <dig> snornas had a conservation score below  <dig>  , suggesting that some snornas are less conserved between primates and rodents. using comparative genomics analysis, we found several lineage- or species-specific snornas. fifteen snorna families were ancient, being present at an early stage of vertebrate evolution, whereas  <dig> snorna families appeared after the divergence of birds and mammals. fourteen young snorna families arose during mammalian evolution and one of these  developed only after primates had arisen. our findings are in line with recent studies in other species. previously, we found  <dig> chicken/bird-specific ncrnas  <cit> , and schmitz reported  <dig> platypus-specific snornas  <cit> . computer analysis of human genomic tiling array data revealed  <dig> putative candidates for classification as primate-specific ncrnas  <cit> . together with previous reports, our data show that ncrnas may play important roles in lineage development, or speciation, during evolution.

although homologs of some rhesus monkey snornas could be found in the mouse and human genomes, the expression of several snornas was not detectable by northern blotting, suggesting that some snorna homologs might be pseudogenes without transcriptional potential in the human and/or mouse. thus, we found only  <dig> potential primate-specific and eight rhesus monkey -specific transcripts . however, it remains possible that undetectable expression in the human or mouse might be attributable to transcriptional regulation by spatio-temporal, physiological, or pathological stimuli/stresses that were not present under the normal conditions prevalent when our tissue samples were taken. in support of this hypothesis, several examples of tissue-specific expression of ncrnas have been reported in previous studies describing brain-specific snornas or snornas involved in neuronal development  <cit> . by analogy, some micrornas and pirnas display specific spatio-temporal expression patterns, and play functional roles in cell differentiation and organogenesis during development  <cit> . in the present study, we also found that snora <dig>  ubiquitously expressed in human and rhesus monkey tissues, is predominantly expressed in the brain of mouse.

in vertebrates, most snornas are located within introns of protein-coding or non-protein-coding genes  <cit> . some snornas are present as several copies, either in different introns of the same gene or within introns of different genes  <cit> . genomic organization analysis showed that the majority of the rhesus monkey snornas identified in this study have multiple paralogs in the rhesus genome, suggesting redundancy arising from duplication, including transposition. diverse molecular mechanisms may be involved in the creation of protein-coding genes, such as gene duplication and retroposition  <cit> . to investigate the mechanisms of rhesus monkey snorna expansion, we analyzed the flanking sequences of each snorna paralog and found that these sequences adjacent to some rhesus monkey snornas have a typical sine-like retroposon characterized by a poly end and tsds, suggesting that some rhesus monkey snorna paralogs are retrogenes formed by autonomous retroposon-mediated retroposition. in addition, the 5' flanking sequences of rhesus monkey snora76b and snora24b possess t2a <dig> motifs, which are preferentially recognized by the l <dig> retroposon-encoded nicking endonuclease, suggesting that snora76b and snora24b were generated from a parental copy by l <dig> integration machinery-mediated retroposition. significantly, we found that six paralogs of snora <dig> also possess typical sine-like retroposon characteristics, and contain multiple poly sequences, indicating that snora <dig> underwent multiple duplication events during evolution. thus, we propose a model involving retroposition for snora <dig> duplication. recently, the mechanisms of snorna gene expansion in other species have been reported. in nematodes, some snorna paralogs were generated by cis- or trans-duplication  <cit> . other data suggest that mammalian snorna genes are sine-like retroposons , and that retroposition mediated by snorts may have played an important role in snorna expansion during evolution of the mammalian genome  <cit> . the extensive expansion of snorna-encoding genes during mammalian evolution might ensure the presence of a functional copy when a parental gene loses function because of mutation. on the other hand, novel paralogs could independently evolve to generate isoforms with different targets/functions, for example the acquisition of new sites complementary to modification regions of rrnas  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we provide the first experimentally-derived catalog of rhesus monkey ncrnas. small nucleolar rnas  comprise one of the largest groups of functionally diverse ncrnas currently known to exist in eukaryotic cells. by performing northern blotting and comparative genomic analysis on rhesus monkey snornas, we determined several features of interest. first, we identified several lineage- or species-specific snornas. moreover, we observed that the majority of snornas have multiple paralogs in the rhesus monkey genome. based on the data from the ensembl genome annotation project, the total number of snorna-encoding genes was shown to have increased during vertebrate evolution. our results demonstrate that sine-like retroposon-mediated trans-duplication may have been a driving force for the expansion of novel snornas in the rhesus monkey genome.
